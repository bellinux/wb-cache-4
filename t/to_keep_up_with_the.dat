5|$|In Pezuelas Lebrón {{began her}} {{education}} in a small community school. Early in her life, Lebrón contracted pneumonia when she accidentally fell into a gutter that was full of water, as a consequence she grew with a frail body and was unable <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> constant activities of her brothers without feeling fatigue. She developed an introverted and contemplative personality, often spending her time admiring nature around the hacienda.|$|E

However, the paper went out of print in January 1911. It was reestablished as a bi-monthly on November 1, and again ceased publication in December. It was restored a third and final time in June 1912, but went out of business soon after.|$|E
5|$|Tripathi had {{initially}} {{decided to write}} a book on philosophy, but was dissuaded by his family members, so he wrote a book on Shiva, one of the Hindu gods. Tripathi's agent decided to publish the book himself. After its release in February 2010, The Immortals of Meluha {{went on to become a}} huge commercial success. It had to be reprinted a number of times <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> demand.|$|E
5|$|Although Enron's {{compensation}} and performance management system {{was designed to}} retain and reward its most valuable employees, the system contributed to a dysfunctional corporate culture that became obsessed with short-term earnings to maximize bonuses. Employees constantly tried to start deals, often disregarding the quality of cash flow or profits, {{in order to get}} a better rating for their performance review. Additionally, accounting results were recorded as soon as possible <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> company's stock price. This practice helped ensure deal-makers and executives received large cash bonuses and stock options.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1990s, the old shop house {{buildings}} were torn down, resulting in street peddlers displaying their wares on canvas sheets along the empty {{roads in the}} area. The peddlers did not pay rent, but the Singapore government forbade them from selling brand-new items. <b>To</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> times, some of the peddlers put up their wares to sell on websites and eBay, especially those hard to sell items such as old photographs, badges, medals and other collector's items. The market remained until its final closure by the authorities on 10 July 2017.|$|E
5|$|Italian silk cloth {{was very}} expensive, {{as much a}} result {{of the cost of the}} raw {{material}} as of the production costs. The craftsmen in Italy proved unable <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> exigencies of French fashion, which continuously demanded lighter and less expensive materials. These materials were used for clothing, and garment production began to be done locally. Nevertheless, Italian silk long remained among the most prized, mostly for furnishings and the brilliant colours of the dyes.|$|E
5|$|North American shipped {{spacecraft}} CM-012 to Kennedy Space Center on August 26, 1966 under a conditional Certificate of Flight Worthiness: 113 significant incomplete planned engineering changes had to {{be completed}} at KSC. But that was not all; an additional 623 engineering change orders were made and completed after delivery. Grissom became so frustrated with {{the inability of the}} training simulator engineers <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> spacecraft changes, that he took a lemon from a tree by his house and hung it on the simulator.|$|E

5|$|The British {{took over}} the Maltese islands as a {{protectorate}} in 1800, and later as a colony in 1813. They initially used the Hospitaller fortifications without any alterations. Under the military theory of the time, the Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet was regarded as the most reliable protection against invasion, {{and in fact the}} British Civil Commissioner, Henry Pigot, wanted to demolish the majority of Valletta's fortifications in 1801, although this was never done. During the British period, the various forts of the Order were rearmed, refitted and altered a number of times <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> latest military technology.|$|E
5|$|The New York {{stage was}} filled with ribald humor and sexually {{offensive}} comedy; when movie producers started to put wisecracks in their sound pictures, they sought New York performers. Popular comics such as the Marx Brothers got their start on Broadway in front of live audiences. Censors complained when they had <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> deluge of jokes in pictures in the early 1930s, {{some of which were}} designed to go over their heads. The comic banter of some early sound films was rapid-fire, non-stop, and frequently exhausting for the audience by the final reel.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortress}} {{was built}} into the south face of a rocky mass, and is barely discernible from the distance as a man-made structure. The defensive capabilities of the fortress have been tested through history in many military operations. During the centuries of its use, the structure served various armies and has undergone a number of renovations, <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> development of arms. The original appearance of the fortress is no longer known, due to the structural changes undertaken by Croatian nobility, Turks, Venetians and Austrians. The present day aspect of a mostly stone fortress {{dates back to the}} restructuring work carried out by the Venetians in the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|Balzac's usual mode of {{revision}} involved vast, complicated edits made to galley proofs {{he received}} from the printer. When creating La Cousine Bette, however, he submitted the work to his editor piece by piece, without viewing a single proof. The book was serialized in Le Constitutionnel from 8October to 3December, and Balzac rushed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> newspaper's rapid printing schedule. He produced an average of eight pages each day, but {{was struck by the}} unexpected enormity of the story as it evolved. Balzac was paid 12,836 francs for the series, which was later published with Le Cousin Pons as a twelve-volume book by Chiendowski and Pétion. The first collected edition of La Cousine Bette was organized into 132 chapters, but these divisions were removed when Balzac added it to his massive collection La Comédie humaine in 1848.|$|E
5|$|Dan Mulligan (Mark Ruffalo) is a {{formerly}} successful {{record label}} executive living in New York City who is estranged {{from his wife}} Miriam (Catherine Keener) and struggling <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> changing music industry. After being fired from his job, he goes on a drinking binge which leads him to a bar in the Lower East Side where he encounters Gretta James (Keira Knightley). Gretta is a young and fiercely independent songwriter who has just broken up with her long-time boyfriend and songwriting partner Dave Kohl (Adam Levine), a newly successful musician who {{had an affair with}} one of his producers' assistants. Captivated by Gretta's music, Dan offers her to sign her to his former record label, and although she initially refuses she reconsiders the offer and agrees.|$|E
5|$|During {{these early}} {{performances}} Verdi made substantial {{changes to the}} score. For some of these he altered his manuscript, but for others musicologists have {{had to rely on}} the numerous full and piano scores put out by Ricordi. Further changes were made for the Paris premiere in 1894, which are also inadequately documented. Ricordi attempted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> changes, issuing new edition after new edition, but the orchestral and piano scores were often mutually contradictory. The Verdi scholar James Hepokoski considers that a definitive score of the opera is impossible, leaving companies and conductors to choose between a variety of options. In a 2013 study Philip Gossett disagrees, believing that the autograph is essentially a reliable source, augmented by contemporary Ricordi editions for the few passages that Verdi omitted to amend in his own score.|$|E

When the Spanish destroyers Plutón and Furor emerged, Indiana was near the harbor entrance and, together with Iowa, she supported the armed yacht Gloucester in the destruction of the lightly armored enemy ships. She was then ordered to keep up the blockade of the harbor in case more Spanish ships came out and so played no role in the chase and sinking of the two remaining Spanish cruisers, Vizcaya and Cristóbal Colón.|$|E

He also revealed that he was contemplating a criminal complaint against James, and had begun volunteering with an organization dedicated to helping male sexual abuse victims. Fleury was surprised that his story became the top-selling non-fiction book in Canada; without help, {{he and his wife were}} unable <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> mail they were receiving. It is the second book about Fleury's life, following Fury, released in 1997, which did not discuss many of the problems he was facing at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{institution}} {{of the welfare state}} was by 1957 accepted by both major parties. Diefenbaker promised to expand the national health insurance scheme to cover tubercular and mental health patients. He characterized the old age pension increase which the Liberal government was instituting as a mere pittance, not even enough <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cost of living. Diefenbaker noted that the increase only amounted to twenty cents a day, using that figure to ridicule Liberal contentions that an increase would add to the rate of inflation. All three opposition parties promised to increase the pension, with the Social Crediters and CCF even stating the specific amounts it would be raised by.|$|E
