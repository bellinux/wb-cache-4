5|$|During the 61st Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference, the Hawaii State Civil Defense {{requested}} {{the retirement of}} the name Daniel, citing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> one of the several storms memorable for threat or damage. However, the World Meteorological Organization did not approve the request.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{dissolution}} of the court in 1597, the musical style which was inspired by the concerto delle donne spread throughout Europe, and remained prominent for almost fifty years. The concerto delle donne was so influential and often imitated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> a cliché of northern Italian courts. The concerto brought Alfonso and his court international prestige, as the ladies' reputation spread throughout Italy and southern Germany. It functioned as a powerful tool of propaganda, projecting an image of strength and affluence.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Wintour {{returned}} to New York {{to take over}} House & Garden. Its circulation had long lagged behind rival Architectural Digest, and Condé Nast hoped she could improve it. Again, she made radical changes to staff and look, canceling $2million worth of photo spreads and articles in her first week. She put so much fashion in photo spreads <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> known as House & Garment, and enough celebrities that it {{was referred to as}} Vanity Chair, within the industry.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Concorde was not withdrawn for the reasons usually given but <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> apparent during the grounding of Concorde that the airlines could make more profit carrying first-class passengers subsonically. A lack of commitment to Concorde from Director of Engineering Alan MacDonald was cited as having undermined BA's resolve to continue operating Concorde.|$|E
5|$|It {{was around}} this time that Edinburgh Zoo's now famous Penguin Parade was established. A zookeeper accidentally left a gate to the penguin pool open, and was {{followed}} around the zoo by a train of penguins. Visitors were so delighted with the procession <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> a regular occurrence, and today around {{two thirds of the}} zoo's penguins parade round the park every day.|$|E
5|$|The {{calculations}} given above produce {{dates in}} radiocarbon years: i.e. dates {{that represent the}} age the sample {{would be if the}} / ratio had been constant historically. Although Libby had pointed out as early as 1955 the possibility that this assumption was incorrect, it was not until discrepancies began to accumulate between measured ages and known historical dates for artefacts <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> clear that a correction would need to be applied to radiocarbon ages to obtain calendar dates.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} dive bombing became so popular among the {{leadership}} of the Luftwaffe <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> almost obligatory in new aircraft designs. Later bomber models like the Junkers Ju 88 and the Dornier Do 217 were equipped for dive bombing. The Heinkel He 177 strategic bomber was initially supposed to have dive bombing capabilities, a requirement that contributed to the failure of the design, with the requirement not rescinded until September 1942 by Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring.|$|E
5|$|Yates did {{not rule}} the Smith Act unconstitutional or even {{overrule}} the Dennis decision, but Yates limited {{the application of the}} Act to such a degree <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> nearly unenforceable.Redish pp 103–105. The Yates decision outraged some conservative members of Congress, who introduced legislation to limit judicial review of certain sentences related to sedition and treason, which did not pass.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Boone {{spent his}} early years on {{what was then the}} edge of the frontier. Several Lenape Indian villages were nearby. The pacifist Pennsylvania Quakers had good {{relations}} with the Native Americans, but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to move further west. Boone was given his first rifle at the age of 12. He learned to hunt from both local settlers and the Lenape. Folk tales have often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone was hunting in the woods with some other boys, when the howl of a panther scattered all but Boone. He calmly cocked his rifle and shot the predator through the heart just as it leaped at him. The validity of this claim is contested, but the story was told so often <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> part of his popular image.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to a lack}} {{of space}} at the University of Chicago, Spedding {{proposed}} to organize part of the Chemistry Division at Iowa State College, where he had colleagues who were willing to help. It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames, and half in Chicago. The intention was that staff at Ames would eventually move to Chicago when space became available, but this never happened. The success of the Ames Project ensured <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> a separate laboratory within the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|Later in August, Tropical Storm Christine {{became the}} easternmost forming {{tropical}} cyclone on record when it developed formed over Guinea. The most intense storm {{of the season}} was Hurricane Ellen, a Category 3 cyclone that remained over open water. The final named storm was meteorologically significant in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> the first recorded tropical cyclone to transition into a subtropical cyclone. No names were retired during the season; however, due to the addition of male names into the list of Atlantic hurricane names in 1979, several of the names were removed and have not been used since.|$|E
5|$|Like {{his father}} before him, Alec Waugh {{went to school}} at Sherborne, and, it was presumed by the family that Evelyn would follow, but in 1915, the school asked Alec to leave, after a {{homosexual}} relationship came to light. Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an officer, and, while awaiting confirmation of his commission, wrote The Loom of Youth (1917), a novel of school life, which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne. The public sensation caused by Alec's novel so offended the school <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> impossible for Evelyn to go there. In May 1917, much to his annoyance, {{he was sent to}} Lancing College, in his opinion, a decidedly inferior school.|$|E

5|$|The Liberal-Courtier coalition's cabinet, formed upon PedroII's {{assumption}} of full powers, convoked national elections for {{seats in the}} legislature convene in 1842. The voting was accompanied by so much violence and fraud <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> known as Elections of the club (or Elections of the truncheon). For Honório Hermeto, this meant {{the loss of his}} seat as general deputy after his bid for reelection failed. The Liberal-Courtier cabinet did not survive long, however, and its ministers presented their resignations in turn. On 23 March 1841, a new cabinet was nominated that included Aureliano Coutinho from the Courtier Faction and other ministers drawn from the Reactionary Party.|$|E
5|$|The {{consumption}} of aviation gasoline during combat and resupply operations {{was so great}} in the early phase of the war, taxing the very limited supply available in the Far East, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> {{one of the more}} serious logistical problems facing UN planners. Ocean tankers could rarely keep pace with the rate of consumption. Although the situation never forced the UN to halt its air operations, on several occasion the situation became quite dire, and was only rectified by the rapid procurement of supplies from Japan. On a number of occasions throughout the war, the demand of military consumption had the effect of leaving Japanese gas stations with no fuel to sell to the public.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} Ravel's two operas, the one-act comedy L'heure espagnole was premiered in 1911. The {{work had been}} {{completed}} in 1907, but {{the manager of the}} Opéra-Comique, Albert Carré, repeatedly deferred its presentation. He was concerned that its plot – a bedroom farce – would be badly received by the ultra-respectable mothers and daughters who were {{an important part of the}} Opéra-Comique's audience. The piece was only modestly successful at its first production, and it was not until the 1920s <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> popular.|$|E

5|$|The {{identification}} of German missile sites by the PRU made Operation Crossbow possible in 1944. Coastal Command continually identified German V-1 launch ramps, despite the German camouflage efforts. This enabled British aircraft to bomb them and reduce their effectiveness by one-third. By June, 69 ramps had been located, {{although it was}} not until 26 February 1945, when Squadron Leader J.E.S. White actually spotted a V-2, on its launch pad, ready to fire, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> clear how elusive a weapon of that size could be.|$|E
5|$|The last {{operations}} of 1941 were in December, when the LRDG twice ferried the SAS {{to and from}} raids on Axis airfields, attacking the airfields at Sirte (twice), El Agheila, Ajdabiya, Nofaliya and Tamit, and destroying 151 aircraft and 30 vehicles. During the second raid at Sirte, the SAS devised a new method of attacking parked aircraft. They drove the LRDG trucks between the rows of aircraft, which were then engaged by machine guns and hand grenades. Prior to this the procedure had been to quietly infiltrate an airfield and place Lewes bombs on aircraft and vehicles, leaving before the bombs exploded, but this attack was so successful <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> the preferred method for attacking airfields.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} the rise of polio in industrialised {{countries}} in the 20th century has never been fully explained. The disease {{is caused by a}} virus that is passed from person to person by the faecal-oral route, and naturally infects only humans. It is a paradox <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> a problem during times of improved sanitation and increasing affluence. Although the virus was discovered {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, its ubiquity was unrecognised until the 1950s. It is now known that fewer than two per cent of individuals who are infected develop the disease, and most infections are mild. During epidemics the virus was effectively everywhere, which explains why public health officials were unable to isolate a source.|$|E
