5|$|There {{was some}} damage <b>to</b> <b>homes</b> and other {{structures}} from this storm, but most damage {{was confined to}} wooded areas. Several major roads, including Route 9, Route 12, and Interstate 190, were closed due to flooding or downed trees. The main financial impact was from damage to utilities, which totalled over $2 million in Princeton alone.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} area {{of severe}} weather also developed that afternoon and evening along the Interstate 81 corridor from central and northern Virginia northward through Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York, continuing into early April 28. Many tornadoes touched {{down in this}} area as well. Most of these tornadoes were weak, though an EF2 tornado touched down {{near the town of}} Halifax, Virginia, and caused severe damage <b>to</b> <b>homes</b> in the area, resulting in one death. Tornado alerts were issued for Southern Ontario as far north as Ottawa as well; one tornado was later confirmed in Fergus, Ontario.|$|E

5|$|As the {{hurricane}} {{passed over the}} Azores, several weather stations reported low barometric pressures, with the lowest being a measurement of 984 mbar (hPa; 29.06 inHg) on Terceira Island at 0600 UTC on September 25. As {{a result of the}} impending storm, several Pan Am Clipper flights to the archipelago were suspended for three consecutive days. The maximum reported gust in the Azores was an observation of 65mph (100km/h) on September25. As a result of moving slowly over the islands, torrential rainfall was also reported. At Angra do Heroísmo, 13.11in (333mm) of precipitation was reported in a four-day, accounting for a third of the station's yearly average rainfall. Strong storm surge was reported at the same location. The waves swept boats away from the coasts of islands. Further inland, there was extensive damage <b>to</b> <b>homes</b> and crops, though no people died. Despite evidence that the system had distinct tropical characteristics, it was not operationally added to HURDAT.|$|E
5|$|Blue Alert warnings, which {{indicate}} that a cyclone may affect the warning area within 48hours, were issued for Cyclone Rosita on the morning on 19 April. They were upgraded to a Yellow Alert– an indication that a cyclone appears inevitable to affect the warning area in 12hours– at 1 pm, then to a Red Alert– meaning the cyclone is imminent– at 8 pm. In general, residents were well informed of the warnings through the radio. Residents from the low-lying downtown areas evacuated <b>to</b> <b>homes</b> in more elevated locations. Two of the three available evacuation shelters were opened and co-ordinated by the Department of Family and Children's Services. 280people took shelter in schools, while 78 residents from Bidyadanga were evacuated to Port Hedland or Broome. The people that stayed in the settlement sheltered {{in the church and}} family homes. Staff and guests at the Eco Beach tourist resort received warnings from Rosita early on 19 April and made a timely return to Broome before the cyclone hit.|$|E

Much of the rich topsoil crop was washed downstream into large reservoirs. Furthermore, agriculture damage totaled about $97.5 million. Damage <b>to</b> <b>homes</b> totaled $17 million while damages to business exceeded $6 million in damage. Public property damage reached $55.7 million. A father, mother, and two children were swept off their truck in Ash Fork. Two navy officers where killed on September 30 near Ostman when their jet crashed. On October 1, a man drowned in the Santa Cruz river. Another person drowned in a wash near Tucson when his truck stalled. In addition, a taxi driver and a passenger died when tried to cross a flooded river.|$|E
5|$|Food {{waste is}} {{generally}} considered to have a damaging effect on the environment; a reduction in food waste is considered critical if the UK is to meet obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill and favourable considering international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. When disposed of in landfill, food waste releases methane, a relatively damaging greenhouse gas, and leachate, a toxin capable of considerable groundwater pollution. The food supply chain accounts for a fifth of UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of food <b>to</b> <b>homes</b> requires large amounts of energy. The effects of stopping food waste that can potentially be prevented has been likened to removing one in five cars from UK roads.|$|E
5|$|In Fairport, NY250 follows South Main Street down a large {{hill that}} levels {{off at the}} {{southern}} edge of the village's business district. Here, NY250 intersects Church Street (NY31F) and passes by the First Baptist Church of Fairport, located on the northwestern corner of the junction. The route continues north {{into the center of the}} village, passing by several small businesses and Fairport Village Landing—the largest shopping plaza in the village—before crossing over the Erie Canal by way of a lift bridge and becoming North Main Street. Once on the north side of the canal, NY250 crosses the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester and West Shore Subdivisions at a single grade crossing ahead of High Street. At this point, the businesses give way <b>to</b> <b>homes</b> as the highway ascends a hill at the north end of the village and meets Whitney Road at the northern village line.|$|E

5|$|Many of the tornadoes {{embedded}} in this initial squall line were weak, though several were strong and caused considerable damage. An EF3 caused major damage <b>to</b> <b>homes</b> in Coaling, Alabama, an EF2 and an EF3 caused major damage and a fatality near Eupora, Mississippi, and an EF3 caused heavy damage in downtown Cordova, Alabama, which {{was struck by}} a deadly EF4 tornado later that afternoon. One embedded cell that began in Cullman County, Alabama produced a long-tracked EF2 that struck the town of Hanceville, killing one person. That cell would go on to produce over ten tornadoes (mostly EF1s) to the northeast in Marshall County and another EF1 in Dade County, Georgia. The initial storms caused widespread power and telephone line outages across Alabama and Tennessee. This line of storms also caused some NOAA weather radio transmitter sites to stop functioning {{for the remainder of the}} outbreak. As a result, many people had no warning of approaching tornadoes later in the day.|$|E
5|$|Many stations, {{including}} WIAT, WBMA/WCFT/WJSU, WTVY (channel 4) in Dothan and WSFA (channel 12) in Montgomery, showed {{television cameras}} capturing the event as the tornado moved east-northeast across {{the western and}} northern suburbs of Birmingham around 6:00p.m. CDT (2300 UTC). Several suburbs in the area were severely damaged by the massive tornado as it tore through {{the west side of}} Birmingham, resulting in multiple fatalities. The suburbs of Concord, Pleasant Grove, and McDonald Chapel were devastated by the tornado as it moved northeast, flattening entire neighborhoods. As the tornado entered the Birmingham city limits, it devastated the Pratt City neighborhood, destroying numerous homes and apartment buildings. The tornado then struck the suburb of Fultondale, causing EF2 damage <b>to</b> <b>homes</b> and businesses before dissipating east of Fultondale. Surveys indicated high-end EF4 damage from the tornado in Birmingham's western suburbs.|$|E

5|$|Power outages were {{reported}} throughout Central and North Florida, with over 93,300customers losing electricity, including about 9,500power outages between Tampa and Temple Terrace. In several counties, such as Alachua, Bradford, Duval, Flagler, Hardee, Martin, Orange, Putnam, and St. Lucie, impact was primarily limited to falling trees, which blocked roads, knocked down some power lines, or left generally minor damage <b>to</b> <b>homes</b> and vehicles. A few tornadoes and waterspouts were spawned during a storm. A waterspout was spotted offshore Lee County near Bonita Springs and Estero. An EF1 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita scale touched down near Jacksonville. The tornado snapped {{a number of}} pine and hardwood trees, while causing roof damage to some homes. At a Publix distribution center, three empty trucks were overturned. A possible tornado in Alachua County {{in the vicinity of}} Hawthorne toppled some trees and damaged a home.|$|E
5|$|Strong winds {{from the}} {{hurricane}} affected 99counties and {{cities in the}} state, which downed thousands of trees and left about 1.8million without power.
