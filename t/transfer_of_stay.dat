40|$|We {{reviewed}} telehealth consultations for acute paediatric patients presenting at rural {{sites in}} the Mackay district in 2012. Patient data and outcomes were collected prospectively, and {{a survey of the}} referring clinicians was undertaken. Thirty four patient consultations were conducted via telehealth with 14 referring clinicians. Most of the referrals were for respiratory illnesses, including bronchiolitis. We received feedback surveys for 16 consultations (57 % response rate). In 47 % of the cases, the paediatric team felt that transfer was avoided by using teleconsultation. In 80 % of consultations, the referring clinicians felt that video consultation was more effective than telephone alone. In 30 % of cases, the referring clinicians felt that the patient would have been transferred to higher facility {{in the absence of the}} telehealth facility. Clinicians thought that almost all consultations had educational value and reduced their anxiety in dealing with acute paediatric problems. There were no adverse outcomes or delayed <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> patients <b>staying</b> at their rural sites. We recommend that telehealth consultation occur for all enquiries about acute paediatric patients at rural sites, especially if <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the patient is being considered...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the association of insurance status or lack of coverage with the quality of care that trauma patients receive when seen in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of ED trauma encounters, as recorded in cross-sectional data from the 2013 National Trauma Data Bank. This data bank is the largest trauma registry in the country, compiled by 805 hospitals including a mix of university, community and non-teaching institutions, ranging from Level I through Level IV trauma centers. Seventeen variables under study included injury severity, primary mode of transport, EMS response time, EMS and ED vital signs and GCS documentation, concurrent alcohol and illicit drug ingestions, ED length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> ED disposition, inter-hospital <b>transfer,</b> hospital length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> number <b>of</b> ICU days, and hospital disposition. Analysis of variables included differences in each area by payer status, as well as ultimate association with mortality attributed to each variable. RESULTS: The strongest associations were seen with hospital disposition (pseudo r 2 of 0. 190 and 0. 270) and ED disposition (pseudo r 2 of 0. 114 and 0. 152). Other variables that were associated with medium-level effect sizes were EMS and ED GCS scores, hospital length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> and number <b>of</b> ICU days.

40|$|Background: Delays to {{definitive}} {{care are}} of particular concern in rural trauma systems, where prehospital times are significantly longer than average. Aims: We evaluated for differences between transferring hospitals in the total time required to transport patients to definitive care, and analyzed for associations between transport times and outcomes. Settings and Design: We employed a cross-sectional design to analyze Level One Trauma Center registry data on interfacility <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> 3, 303 acute trauma patients. Materials and Methods: We calculated time in minutes from injury to definitive care (total elapsed time (TET)), and analyzed for associations between TET and both mortality and length <b>of</b> hospital <b>stay</b> at our center. We mapped hospitals and catchment areas to illustrate statistics by transferring hospital. Statistical Analysis: We employed analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to analyze for the effect of TET and injury severity category upon hospital length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> and {{for the effects of}} TET and air transport as compared to ground transport. We evaluated for likelihood of in-hospital mortality using logistic regression. Results: TET had little or no effect upon length <b>of</b> hospital <b>stay</b> or in-hospital mortality. The effect of injury severity upon both length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> and mortality was progressively greater with each categorical increase in severity. Air transport as compared to ground transport was associated with mild increases in length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> and likelihood <b>of</b> mortality.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} focused on three main questions: what factors can determine length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> for primary surgery for breast cancer? can these factors {{be attributed to}} the decreasing trend in mean length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> for primary breast-cancer surgery? and can there be any adverse effect of declining length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> such as prolonged sick leave, following breast-cancer surgery? For the four studies of the thesis, routinely collected data was used. In study I the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register was used to describe the trend in mean length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> women surgically treated for breast cancer and to investigate the effect of the increasing use of breast-conserving surgery on the decreasing trend in mean length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> In study II the effect of stage of disease on length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> was investigated using the Southern Swedish Tumour Register and the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register. To study the possible adverse effect on prolonged sick leave of decreasing length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> data from the National Cancer Register, the Sick Leave Register and the National Hospital Discharge Register were combined (study III). In study IV the effect of social factors on length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> was investigated using the Swedish Social Medicine Database. In terms of determinant <b>of</b> length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> the present results support the hypothesis that individual factors such as age, severity of cancer according to tumour size and social factors influence length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Differences in length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> according to clinical practice style, such as different types of surgery, were found. There was a difference of about 30 per cent in length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> between breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy. The results indicate a small effect of change in type of surgery on the mean-length-of-stay trend. In the two studies investigating the effect of changes in surgery on mean length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> the calculated effects of the changes in techniques were 14 and 13 per cent, respectively. Cancer stage distribution did not affect the trend. In study III one possible adverse effect <b>of</b> reduced hospital <b>stay</b> was analyzed, namely the number of sick leave days after discharge. A statistical correlation between median length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> for a particular hospital and number of sick leave days following discharge was established. Shorter median length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> for a hospital is related to longer sick leave periods following care, indicating a possible adverse effect of shorter length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> But long median length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> for a hospital was also related to longer sick leave period...|$|R

40|$|Background: In St. John's, Newfoundland {{there are}} three {{tertiary}} care institutions that provide acute inpatient psychiatry services. To date, the factors associated with increased length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> in these institutions, has not been systematically studied. [...] Some of the psychiatrists who admit patients to these facilities have speculated that the length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> {{and the distribution of}} the factors associated with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> varies across the inpatient psychiatric facilities in the city. The accuracy of their opinions has not been examined previously. [...] Objectives: Length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> on acute care hospital units is influenced by many factors such as patient demographics, diagnosis, treatment regime and attitudes of the attending physician. This study has three objectives: 1) to identify the factors associated with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> on the acute admission wards in St. John's, Newfoundland, 2) to assess the accuracy of the psychiatrists' opinions that length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> differs significantly among the three psychiatric institutions in St. John's and 3) to assess the accuracy of the psychiatrist's opinions with respect to the factors that impact on length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> in St. John's, Newfoundland. [...] Method: A chart review was conducted to measure length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> by institution and to determine which factors were associated with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> for inpatient psychiatry units in St. John's. The data represents patients discharged from hospital between April and June 1997 inclusive. The patients were above 19 years of age, were discharged from an acute care inpatient unit during the study period, and had no other admissions during the thirty days prior to the admission or within 30 days of the discharge. Fourteen variables were examined for a potential association with length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Regression analysis was used to identify significant associations between patient, illness and treatment related factors and length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> [...] Data from the chart review was also used to assess the accuracy of the psychiatrists' opinion that length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> varies significantly among the acute care admissions of the city. The length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> was calculated for each admission site and then compared for significant differences. [...] Psychiatrists' perceptions of the factors associated with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> were gathered by an opinion questionnaire. The questionnaire was administered to all psychiatrists with admitting privileges for the acute psychiatry inpatient sites in St. John's. Descriptive analysis was used to quantify the psychiatrists' opinions. These opinions were then compared to the results of the chart review for factors associated with length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> [...] Results: Results of the chart review revealed that length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> did not vary significantly among the three institutions, or between the two types of admission sites. Of the fourteen factors examined for an association with length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> patient age, primary diagnosis, presence of a discharge plan, and duration of the discharge plan were significant. The involvement of pastoral care workers in the patient care almost reached the level of significance. [...] Results of the survey revealed that the majority of psychiatrists were of the opinion that patient age, gender and race had little impact on length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> The age and gender of the treating psychiatrist were also believed to have little impact on length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Level <b>of</b> education, marital status, employment status, income level, and place of residence were believed to have moderate impact on length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> The level <b>of</b> patient stress, primary diagnosis, the presence of co-morbid illness, treatment issues, the expertise of the attending psychiatrist and the practice composition of the attending psychiatrist were believed to impact substantially on length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> This was not entirely consistent with the results of the chart review. [...] Discussion: Four of the fourteen variables were significantly associated with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> on the inpatient psychiatry units in St. John's, Newfoundland. Several of {{these findings are consistent with}} earlier studies. Of the ten remaining factors that were not significantly related to length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> seven had been previously studied and shown to be associated with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> in other clinical settings. This suggests that the factors associated with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> in St. John's, Newfoundland may be unique to that region and that length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> literature is not universally applicable. [...] The psychiatrists' perception that lengths <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> varied significantly among sites was inaccurate. As well, the psychiatrists' perceptions of factors that are associated with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> were not consistent with the findings of the chart review. This discrepancy between opinion and reality warrants further examination if physicians are to be expected to actively reduce length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> in the future...|$|R

40|$|Background: Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) are a {{worldwide}} problem. International migration and travel facilitate {{the spread of}} MDRO. Therefore the goal of our study {{was to assess the}} risk of influx of MDRO from patients <b>transferred</b> to one <b>of</b> Central Europe’s largest hospitals from abroad. Methods: A mono-centre study was conducted. All patients transferred from other countries were screened; additional data was collected on comorbidities, etc. Presence of carbapenemases of multidrug-resistant Gram-negatives was confirmed by PCR. The association between length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> being colonized and/or infected by a MDRO, country of origin, diagnosis and other factors was assessed by binomial regression analyses. Results: From 2012 to 2013, one fifth of all patients were colonized with MDRO (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [4. 1  %], Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci [2. 9  %], multidrug-resistant Gram-negatives [12. 8  %] and extensively drug-resistant Gram-negatives [3. 4  %]). The Gram-negatives carried a variety of carbapenemases including OXA, VIM, KPC and NDM. The length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> was significantly prolonged by 77. 2  % in patients colonized with a MDRO, compared to those not colonized (p< 0. 0001).

This paper employs a rich micro dataset on tourists departing the Azores, a group of small Portuguese islands, widely perceived as a tourist destination with high growth potential due to its unique nature, which, hence, must be addressed with care given its small carrying capacity.

METHODS: The study sample consisted of 4551 patients discharged after AMI from all greater Worcester, Mass, hospitals in 8 annual periods during the study period. Regression models were used to examine the influence of demographic, clinical, and treatment variables on length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> and the association between declining length <b>of</b> hospital <b>stay</b> and postdischarge mortality. RESULTS: Marked declines were observed in the average length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> between the 1986 - 1988 (11. 7 days) and 1997 - 1999 (5. 9 days) periods. Factors associated with a longer hospital stay included advanced age, female sex, anterior and Q-wave MI, and occurrence of clinically important cardiac complications. Patients with health maintenance organization, Medicare, Medicaid, or no insurance coverage were less likely to have an increased length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Increased 30 - and 90 -day mortality was associated with a length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> greater than 14 days (odds ratio, 2. 08; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 18 - 3. 66) relative to those with a length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> 6 to 8 days (odds ratio, 2. 01; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 34 - 3. 01).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{relation between}} inpatient length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> after hip fracture {{and risk of}} death after hospital discharge. SETTING: Population ≥ 50 years old living in Sweden as of 31 December 2005 with a first hip fracture the years 2006 - 12. PARTICIPANTS: 116 [*] 111 patients with an incident hip fracture from a closed nationwide cohort. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death within 30 days of hospital discharge in relation to hospital length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> after adjustment for multiple covariates. RESULTS: Mean inpatient length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> after a hip fracture decreased from 14. 2 days in 2006 to 11. 6 days in 2012 (P< 0. 001). The association between length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> and risk <b>of</b> death after discharge was non-linear (P< 0. 001), with a threshold for this non-linear effect of about 10 days. Thus, for patients with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> ≤ 10 days (n= 59 [*] 154), each 1 -day reduction in length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> increased the odds of death within 30 days of discharge by 8 % in 2006 (odds ratio 1. 08 (95 % confidence interval 1. 04 to 1. 12)), which increased to 16 % in 2012 (odds ratio 1. 16 (1. 12 to 1. 20)). In contrast, for patients with a length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> ≥ 11 days (n= 56 [*] 957), a 1 -day reduction in length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> {{was not associated with}} an increased risk of death after discharge during any of the years of follow up. LIMITATIONS: No accurate evaluation of the underlying cause of death could be performed. CONCLUSION: Shorter length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> in hospital after hip fracture is associated with increased risk of death after hospital discharge, but only among patients with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> 10 days or less.

The objective of these centers is to improve care and neurological recovery of patients suffering from a spinal cord injury. An interdisciplinary group of experts composed of medical and surgical specialists treating patients with SCI formulated the following questions: (1) Is there any {{evidence to suggest that}} specialized centers of care in SCI decrease the length <b>of</b> patient <b>stay?</b> and (2) Is there evidence that specialized centers {{of care for}} SCI reduce mortality and secondary complications? A systematic review of the current evidence was performed using multiple databases to answer these two specific questions. Two independent reviewers graded each paper using the Black and Downs method. Recommendations were then formulated based on the evidence available and were reviewed by a panel of experts using a modified Delphi approach. Two recommendations were formulated and both received complete agreement from a panel of experts. The first recommendation is “Early <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> a patient with traumatic SCI to a specialized center of care should be done promptly to decrease overall length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> ” The second recommendation is “Early <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> patients with traumatic SCI to an integrated multidisciplinary specialized center of care decreases overall mortality, and the number and severity of complications. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{framework}} to predict the impact of new health technologies on average length <b>of</b> hospital <b>stay.</b> Methods: A literature search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and the Health Management Information Consortium databases was conducted to identify papers that discuss the impact of new technology on length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> or report the impact with a proposed mechanism of impact of specific technologies on length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> The mechanisms <b>of</b> impact were categorized into those relating to patients, the technology, or the organization of health care and clinical practice. Results: New health technologies have a variable impact on length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Technologies that lead to an increase in the proportion of sicker patients or increase the average age of patients remaining in the hospital lead to an increase in individual and average length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Technologies that do not affect or improve the inpatient case mix, or reduce adverse effects and complications, or speed up the diagnostic or treatment process should lead to a reduction in individual length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> and, if applied to all patients with the condition, will reduce average length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Conclusions: The prediction framework we have developed will ensure that the characteristics of a new technology that may influence length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> can be consistently taken into consideration by assessment agencies. It is recognized that the influence of technology on length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> will change as a technology diffuses and that length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> is highly sensitive to changes in admission policies and organization of care...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. This study {{sought to}} {{identify}} current trends in length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> in patients with an acute myocardial infarction and to evaluate which demographic, clinical, procedural and hospitalrelated factors explain the variation and reduction in length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> observed during the study period. Background. Hospital length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> is {{an important contribution to}} cost of care. Previous studies <b>of</b> length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> after acute myocardial infarction have been performed largely on administrative data bases and do not reflect current practice patterns. Methods. We used univariate and multivariate models to evaluate which demographic, clinical and administrative factors influenced length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> in 11, 932 patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted to 19 Seattle-area hospitals between 1988 and 1994. Results. Length <b>of</b> hospital <b>stay</b> decreased from (mean ± SD) 8. 5 ± 8. 2 to 6. 0 ± 5. 8 days during the study period. Demographic and clinical characteristics known at the time of admission explained only 6 % of variation in length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> whereas hospital complications, procedure use and type of admitting hospital explained an additional 27 % of variation. The use of primary angioplasty and early diagnostic coronary angiography predicted a shorter length of stay; however, none of the measured variables explained the 29 % reduction in length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> that occurred between 1988 and 1994. Conclusions. Although hospital complications, procedure use and hospital characteristics are important predictors of length <b>of</b> hospital <b>stay,</b> none <b>of</b> these factors explains the 29 % reduction in length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> observed in postmyocardial infarction patients between 1988 and 1994. It is likely that unmeasured economic and administrative factors play important roles in influencing hospital length <b>of</b> <b>stay...</b>|$|R
