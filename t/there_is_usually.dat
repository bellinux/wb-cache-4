5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} without a clock, but then <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> a rule {{preventing}} a player waiting for pieces (stalling or sitting) indefinitely. One rule states that players may not delay their move beyond {{the time that it}} takes for their partner to make three moves.|$|E
5|$|Treatment is with {{anticoagulants}} (medication that suppresses blood clotting), {{and rarely}} thrombolysis (enzymatic {{destruction of the}} blood clot). Given that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> an underlying cause for the disease, tests may be performed to look for these. The disease may be complicated by raised intracranial pressure, which may warrant surgical intervention such as the placement of a shunt.|$|E
5|$|After {{the launch}} of the {{persecution}} campaign in 1999, practitioners outside China began holding frequent protests, rallies, and appeals. These include large-scale marches, demonstrations, and vigils to coincide with notable anniversaries, such as April 25, 1999, and July 20, 1999. Marches typically involve participants holding signs and banners, devoting different sections of the parade to different aspects of the persecution. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> a section involving participants wearing only white (symbolizing mourning) and holding photos of those killed in China.|$|E
50|$|Within an industrialized country <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> {{few if any}} {{significant}} barriers to the easy exchange {{of goods and services}} between parts of that country. For example, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> no trade tariffs or import quotas; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> no delays as goods pass from one part of the country to another (other than those that distance imposes); <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> no differences of taxation and regulation. Between countries, on the other hand, many of these barriers to the easy exchange of goods often do occur. It <b>is</b> commonplace for <b>there</b> to <b>be</b> import duties {{of one kind or another}} (as goods enter a country) and the levels of sales tax and regulation often vary by country.|$|R

5|$|In the brain, AVMs {{occasionally}} exert pressure, {{leading to}} headaches. They may {{also increase the}} risk of seizures, as would any abnormal tissue in the brain. Finally, hemorrhage from an AVM may lead to intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), which causes any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness in part of the body or difficulty speaking. If the bleeding occurs into the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid hemorrhage), <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> a severe, sudden headache and decreased level of consciousness and often weakness in part of the body.|$|E
5|$|Referring to the {{character}} of the eruption and the rapidity of its development, modified smallpox occurred mostly in previously vaccinated people. In this form the prodromal illness still occurred but may be less severe than in the ordinary type. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> no fever during evolution of the rash. The skin lesions tended to be fewer and evolve more quickly, are more superficial, and may not show the uniform characteristic of more typical smallpox. Modified smallpox was rarely, if ever, fatal. This form of variola major is more easily confused with chickenpox.|$|E

5|$|A {{transitional}} fossil is any fossilized {{remains of}} a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. This is especially important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve {{as a reminder that}} taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> no way to know exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Afrikaners {{are a small}} group (10%) within the white {{minority}} group, Afrikaner recipes are popular. Biltong, a type of jerky, is a popular snack, prepared by hanging bits of spiced raw meat to dry in the shade. Boerewors is served with sadza. It is a long sausage, often well-spiced, composed of beef rather than pork, and barbecued. As Zimbabwe was a British colony, some people there have adopted some colonial-era English eating habits. For example, most people will have porridge in the morning, as well as 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, often leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked sadza, or sandwiches (which {{is more common in}} the cities). After lunch, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner.|$|E
5|$|Like all insects, wasps {{have a hard}} {{exoskeleton}} {{which protects}} their three main body parts, the head, the mesosoma (including the thorax and the first segment of the abdomen) and the metasoma. There is a narrow waist, the petiole, joining {{the first and second}} segments of the abdomen. The two pairs of membranous wings are held together by small hooks and the forewings are larger than the hind ones; in some species, the females have no wings. In females <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> a rigid ovipositor which may be modified for injecting venom, piercing or sawing. It either extends freely or can be retracted, and may be developed into a stinger for both defence and for paralysing prey.|$|E

5|$|Relay {{races are}} the only track and field event in which a team of runners {{directly}} compete against other teams. Typically, a team {{is made up of}} four runners of the same sex. Each runner completes their specified distance (referred to as a leg) before handing over a baton to a teammate, who then begins their leg upon receiving the baton. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> a designated area where athletes must exchange the baton. Teams may be disqualified if they fail to complete the change within the area, or if the baton is dropped during the race. A team may also be disqualified if its runners are deemed to have wilfully impeded other competitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{participants}} in a LARP physically portray characters in a fictional setting, improvising their characters' speech and movements somewhat like actors in improvisational theatre. This is distinct from tabletop role-playing games, where character actions are described verbally. LARPs may be played in a public or private area and may last for hours or days. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> no audience. Players may dress as their character and carry appropriate equipment, and the environment is sometimes decorated to resemble the setting. LARPs can be one-off events or {{a series of events}} in the same setting, and events can vary in size from a handful of players to several thousand.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the most}} common type of aphthous stomatitis, {{accounting}} for about 80–85% of all cases. This subtype is termed minor aphthous ulceration (MiAU), or minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis (MiRAS). The lesions themselves may be referred to as minor aphthae or minor aphthous ulcers. These lesions are generally less than 10mm in diameter (usually about 2–3mm), and affect non-keratinized mucosal surfaces (i.e. the labial and buccal mucosa, lateral borders of the tongue and the floor of the mouth). Usually several ulcers appear at the same time, but single ulcers are possible. Healing usually takes seven to ten days and leaves no scar. Between episodes of ulceration, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> an ulcer-free period of variable length.|$|E

5|$|A deck {{decompression}} chamber (DDC), or double-lock chamber is a two compartment {{pressure vessel}} for human occupation which has sufficient space in the main chamber for two or more occupants, and a forechamber which can allow a person to be pressurised or decompressed while the main chamber remains under constant pressure. This allows an attendant to be locked in or out during treatment of the occupant(s) of the main chamber. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> also a medical lock, which serves a similar function but is much smaller. This is used to transfer medical material, food and specimens {{into and out of}} the main chamber while it is under pressure. Most {{deck decompression chamber}}s are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathig gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E
5|$|A general {{principle}} concerning dental abscesses is ubi pus, ibi evacua ("{{where there is}} pus, drain it"), which applies to any case {{where there is a}} collection of pus in the tissues (such as a periodontal abscess, pericoronal abscess, or apical abscess). The pus within the abscess is under pressure, and the surrounding tissues are deformed and stretched to accommodate the swelling. This leads to a sensation of throbbing (often in time with the pulse) and constant pain. Pus may be evacuated via the tooth by drilling into the pulp chamber (an endodontic access cavity). Such a treatment is sometimes termed open drainage. Drainage can also be performed via the tooth socket, once the causative tooth is extracted. If neither of those measures succeeds, or they are impossible, incision and drainage may be required, in which a small incision is made in the soft tissues directly over the abscess at the most dependent point. A surgical instrument such as a pair of tweezers is gently inserted into the incision and opened, while the abscess is massaged to encourage the pus to drain out. Usually, the reduction in pain when the pus drains is immediate and marked as the built up pressure is relieved. If the pus drains into the mouth, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> a bad or offensive taste.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda slow loris may {{fit into}} the monogamous single male/single female social system, though are mainly known to be solitary. One study showed only 8% of the species' active time was spent near other individuals. Where home ranges overlap, spatial groups are formed. These groups consist of one male, one female and up to three younger individuals. The {{interactions}} between these individuals are largely friendly; they include allogrooming, following, pant-growling, and click-calling, although social behaviors only make up around 3% of the activity budget. When it comes into contact with conspecifics from other home ranges <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> no reaction as home ranges are not defended. In captivity however, it can be aggressive with other individuals. Males have shown antagonistic behaviors such as attacks, pursuits, threats, assertion, fighting, and subordination. The fighting often results in serious injury. Despite this, they {{are known to be}} generally sociable in captivity, with allogrooming being the most common social behavior.|$|E

5|$|The anteroconid—the cusp at {{the front}} of m1—is usually divided in two by a central {{indentation}} (the anteromedian fossettid) in A.donovani, but this fossettid is absent in A.praeuniversitatis. Behind the anteroconid is the protoconid—metaconid pair of cusps. There is an anterolabial cingulum—a crest {{at the front}} labial margin, in front of the protoconid. There is a long crest behind the metaconid, a mesolophid. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> no corresponding crest (an ectolophid) behind the protoconid. Another pair of cusps—the hypoconid and the entoconid—is located {{at the back of the}} tooth. The entoconid, the lingual cusp of the two, is oriented forwards. There is always a large root {{at the front of}} the tooth and another at the back. A.donovani usually has a small labial root between the two large roots and often also another small root at the lingual side, but only one of four A.praeuniversitatis m1s even has the labial rootlet.|$|E
5|$|There {{are nine}} Twin-Pyramid Complexes at Tikal, {{one of which}} was {{completely}} dismantled in ancient times and some others were partly destroyed. They vary in size but consist of two pyramids facing each other on an east–west axis. These pyramids are flat-topped and have stairways on all four sides. A row of plain stelae is placed immediately {{to the west of the}} eastern pyramid and to the north of the pyramids, and lying roughly equidistant from them, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> a sculpted stela and altar pair. On the south side of these complexes there is a long vaulted building containing a single room with nine doorways. The entire complex was built at once and these complexes were built at 20-year (or k'atun) intervals during the Late Classic. The first twin pyramid complex was built in the early 6th century in the East Plaza. It was once thought that these complexes were unique to Tikal but rare examples have now been found at other sites, such as Yaxha and Ixlu, and they may reflect the extent of Tikal's political dominance in the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|A {{standard}} adult football match {{consists of}} two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most {{commonly referred to as}} stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, {{towards the end of the}} half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90minutes had elapsed and the game was over. The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.|$|E
