Additionally, correlations were analysed between the contents of these compounds in blood, liver, and muscles of the birds. The experiment was conducted on 240 one-week-old <b>turkey</b> <b>hens</b> reared until 16 weeks of age, randomly allocated into two feeding groups. Hens from the first group received soybean oil in their complete feed mixture, whereas linseed oil {{was the source of}} fat for <b>turkey</b> <b>hens</b> from the second group. The oil content of the diet was on the level appropriate for the period of feeding: Starter - 0. 5 %; Grower I - 1. 0 %, Grower II - 2. 5 %; Finisher I - 3 %. The redox parameters were assayed in breast and thigh muscles, blood, and liver. Introduction of PUFA n- 3 high linseed oil to a feed mixture contributed to the enhancement of lipid peroxidation processes, which was indicated by a significant increase in concentrations of H 2 O 2 and malondialdehyde in muscles, and by an increase of superoxide dismutase activity and concentrations of vitamin C and minerals (Cu+ 2, Zn+ 2, Fe+ 2, Se+ 2). This points out the need of strengthening the antioxidative defence by the use of suitable antioxidants.

40|$|A turkey {{prolactin}} (PRL) cDNA, encoding a 199 {{amino acid}} turkey PRL (tPRL), was cloned from a pituitary library. The mature PRL shared about 70 % homology with mammalian PRLs and about 30 % with fish PRLs. Areas of highest homology to other PRLs {{were located in}} the carboxyl terminus of the tPRL. Prolactin mRNA analyses, during the reproductive life of the <b>turkey</b> <b>hen,</b> confirmed that the high pituitary and plasma levels of PRL measured during the incubation phase are due to enhanced transcription of the PRL gene.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{biological}} {{basis of}} sustained fertility in broiler and <b>turkey</b> <b>hens</b> is {{their capacity to}} store sperm in the oviductal sperm storage tubules (SST) located in the uterovaginal junction. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine if the numbers of SST varied between 4 strains of broiler breeders and de-termine the number of SST in the turkey before (less than 9 d of photostimulation) and after (up to 22 d of photostimulation and laying) photostimulation. No statistical differences were observed in SST numbers in the 4 strains of broilers examined or in <b>turkey</b> <b>hens</b> before and after the onset of egg production. The mean numbers of SST for broilers and turkeys were 4, 893 and 30, 566, respectively. We conclude that any differences between the fertility of the 4 broiler breeder strains examined cannot be explained by differences in SST numbers. However, differences in the duration of fertil-ity between broilers and turkeys are, in part, related to their respective numbers of number of SST. Further-more, we conclude that turkey SST are morphologically differentiated and functional before the onset of photo-stimulation and while the oviduct is morphologically undeveloped.

40|$|ABSTRACT Nine {{groups of}} 12 Small-type White turkey hens each {{were used to}} study dietary vitamin D 3 and calcium and their effect on egg production, eggshell quality, and hatchability.

Increasing dietary calcium to 2. 25 % significantly improved body weight, egg production and feed efficiency (feed/kg. eggs). The 3. 34 % level of calcium stimulated an increase in percentage hatchability of fertile eggs and produced the lowest percentage of 28 -day embryonic mortalitites.

Heidelberg colonization in the cecum, dissemination to liver and spleen, and deposition in the thigh, drumstick, and breast muscles. A similar experimental design was followed for the adult <b>turkey</b> <b>hens.</b> In two separate experiments, 11 -week-old commercial Hybrid Converter <b>turkey</b> <b>hens</b> (4 hens/group; N = 20 /experiment) were challenged with MDR S. Heidelberg and on day 16 post-challenge, birds were euthanized and samples were collected to determine Salmonella populations in the samples. The results indicated that, in turkey poults, the recovery of MDR S. Heidelberg was highest in the cecum followed by spleen, liver, thigh, drumstick, and breast. All tested inoculum levels resulted in more than 3. 5 log 10 CFU/g colonization in the poult cecum. The cecal colonization, dissemination to internal organs, and tissue deposition of MDR S. Heidelberg were high in poults. The pathogen recovery from the cecum of adult <b>turkey</b> <b>hens</b> ranged from 37. 5 to 62. 5 % in the challenge groups. The results signify the importance of controlling MDR S. Heidelberg in turkeys at the farm level to improve the safety of turkey products...|$|R
