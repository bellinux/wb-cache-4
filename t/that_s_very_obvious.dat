40|$|Central t o the {{derivation}} of the P. A. S. formulation is {{the establishment}} of the Normal Level. The methods for computing ~ o r m d Level are as num-erous and varied as the clinical interpretations which are getlerated &om the formula itself. If there is anything definite which can be said about this con-cept, i t i <b>s</b> <b>that</b> <b>very</b> few wlio use the P. A. S. agree with others about just which mathematical process should be used to establish the value. Indivi-dual clinicians often experiment until they ultimately find one method which seems to work for them. Students learning the system are often taught, as a matter df fact, that Normal Level is derived precisely the way in which their teacher has demonstrated. Of course, they find out later that some thirty-odd other approaches could have been taken. Beyond all of this, the most serious consideration in this regard is the matter of demonstrating the System's validity. Some <b>very</b> <b>obvious</b> methodo-logical problems exist when different researchers attempt common defini-tion from divergent approaches. Empericism aside; possibly the most frus...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{agricultural}} and forestry land use materials, {{especially those in}} the first half of 20 th century, were collected. According to land use change in this period, the whole country is demarcated into seven regions, Northeast China, North China, Northwest and Loess Plateau, Southeast and Coastal Region, Southwest China, Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang, in proper order by using Cluster Analysis. The farming and forestry land use change in these regions were analyzed. The results show that the total cultivated land areas increased in this period, especially in the 1950 s and 1960 s the cultivated land area increased more significantly, but differed in different regions, and the most rapid increasing rate was 2. 63 percent a year. On the other hand, the forestry land area was increasing in most parts of this period, especially after 1949. But in most regions, the decrease of forestry land area at the end of 1970 <b>s</b> is also <b>very</b> <b>obvious.</b> It is regarded that the population increase, food production, natural disasters and some related government policies were among the main driving factors for farming and forestry land use change.

40|$|Growth {{data for}} Scomberomorus commerson in Oman were coupled with other {{information}} about the fishery to provide preliminary management recommendations. Length data collected from the commercial catch were {{used in conjunction with}} counts ofdaily and annular growth marks on otoliths to determine growth rate. These data revealed <b>that</b> <b>S.</b> commerson grow <b>very</b> rapidly, reaching a size ofabout 80 cm in 1 year and between 100 and 110 cm in 2 years, after which growth slows considerably. A tabular yield model indicates that protection of rapidly growing young S. commerson could have significant benefits for the fishery. This protection could be accomplished by instituting moderate mesh regulations...|$|R

40|$|We analyze {{here for}} the first time the {{swimming}} behavior of a thermophilic, strictly anaerobic Spirochete, namely Spirochaeta thermophila using high temperature light microscopy. Our data show <b>that</b> <b>S.</b> thermophila <b>very</b> rapidly can change its morphology during swimming, resulting in cells appearing nearly linear, in cells possessing three different spiral forms, and in cells being linear at one end and spiral at the other end. In addition cells can rapidly bend by up to 180 °, with their ends coming into close contact. We combine electron with light microscopy to explain these various cell morphologies. Swimming speeds for cells with the various morphologies did not differ significantly: the average speed was 33 (+/- 8) µm/s, with minimal and maximal speeds of 19 µm/s and 59 µm/s, respectively. Addition of gelling agents like polyvinylpyrrolidone or methyl cellulose to the growth medium resulted in lower and not higher swimming speeds, arguing against the idea that the highly unusual cell body plan of S. thermophila enables cells to swim more efficiently in gel-like habitats...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the optimum source conductance G(sub s) for the superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) quasiparticle mixer should have a l/f dependence. This would imply that the critical current density of SIS junctions used for mixing should increase as frequency squared, a stringent constraint on the design of submillimeter SIS mixers, rather than in simple proportion to frequency as previously believed. We have used Tucker's quantum theory of mixing for extensive numerical calculations to determine G(sub s) for an optimized SIS receiver. We find <b>that</b> G(sub <b>s)</b> is <b>very</b> roughly independent of frequency (except for the best junctions at low frequency), and discuss the implications of our results for the design of submillimeter SIS mixers...|$|R
