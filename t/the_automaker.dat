25|$|Teague was Vice President at <b>the</b> <b>automaker</b> from 1964 {{until he}} retired from AMC in 1983. At his retirement, he joked that the only Detroit auto company he had not worked for was Ford.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{difficult}} working {{conditions in the}} auto production plants, auto workers began to seek representation to help improve conditions and ensure fair pay. The United Automobile Workers union won recognition from GM and Chrysler in 1937, and Ford in 1941. In 1950, <b>the</b> <b>automakers</b> granted workers a company-paid pension to those 65 years old and with 30 years seniority. In <b>the</b> mid-1950s, <b>the</b> <b>automakers</b> agreed {{to set up a}} trust fund for unemployed auto workers. In 1973, <b>the</b> <b>automakers</b> agreed to offer pensions to any worker with 30 years seniority, regardless of age. By then <b>the</b> <b>automakers</b> had also agreed to cover the entire health insurance bill for its employees, survivors, and retirees.|$|R

2500|$|As {{the newly}} {{appointed}} board chairman of AMC, Evans immediately promised [...] "a different philosophy and approach" [...] in <b>the</b> <b>automaker's</b> affairs. Unlike <b>the</b> then existing management at AMC, Evans freely criticized the leadership under George W. Romney [...] "for failing {{to adjust to}} a changing market" [...] and started to [...] "shake things up in Kenosha" [...] as solutions to <b>the</b> <b>automaker's</b> problems.|$|R
25|$|Meyers next {{worked for}} Chrysler Corporation. During {{the eight years}} with <b>the</b> <b>automaker,</b> he became Director of Manufacturing for the company's {{overseas}} plants in 1961 and lived in Geneva, Switzerland for three years.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>automaker</b> {{announced}} {{two days}} later {{that it had been}} approached with new offers, by April 2010, any sale became unlikely, as inventory was depleted and Hummer dealerships began shutting down. After filling a rental-car fleet order, the last HummerH3 rolled off the line at Shreveport on May 24, 2010.|$|E
25|$|By {{appealing}} to AMC with its concept vehicle, Budd’s already existing business with AMC would increase. It wanted to supply bodies and major sub-assemblies to <b>the</b> <b>automaker</b> for a production {{version of this}} new car. Budd estimated that the new model could be available for public sale by October 1963, six months ahead of the Ford Mustang.|$|E
50|$|The 2000s {{began with}} a {{recession}} in early 2001 {{and the effects of}} the September 11 attacks, significantly affecting auto industry sales and profitability. The stock market decline affected the pension fund levels of <b>the</b> <b>automakers,</b> requiring significant contributions to the funds by <b>the</b> <b>automakers</b> (with GM financing these contributions by raising debt). In 2001, Chrysler discontinued their Plymouth brand, and in 2004 GM ended their Oldsmobile division.|$|R

25|$|In 2012, {{employees}} at the Chrysler factories in Windsor and Brampton, Ontario ratified the CAW’s labor agreement by an overwhelming majority, without any information from <b>the</b> <b>automaker</b> about plans for new products or investment at either plant. As of December 2012, the Brampton Assembly Plant is the single largest employer in Canada's 11th largest city.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>automaker</b> {{reported}} the largest annual loss in company history in 2006 of $12.7billion, and estimated {{that it would}} not return to profitability until 2009. However, Ford surprised Wall Street {{in the second quarter of}} 2007 by posting a $750million profit. Despite the gains, the company finished the year with a $2.7billion loss, largely attributed to finance restructuring at Volvo.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. {{economy was}} {{experiencing}} inflation, and new car sales fell for all <b>the</b> <b>automakers.</b> <b>The</b> industry sold 8.2 million units, {{a drop of}} more than 2.5 million from the record pace in 1973. Sales of the Hornet also suffered.|$|R
25|$|The {{world of}} bull{{fighting}} {{is a key}} part of Lamborghini's identity. In 1962, Ferruccio Lamborghini visited the Seville ranch of Don Eduardo Miura, a renowned breeder of Spanish fighting bulls. Lamborghini, a Taurus himself, was so impressed by the majestic Miura animals that he decided to adopt a raging bull as the emblem for <b>the</b> <b>automaker</b> he would open shortly.|$|E
25|$|The Alliance afforded AMC the {{opportunity}} to field a new compact car without the expense of its design and tooling, still the business relationship with Renault exacted a heavy price on the U.S. company. <b>The</b> <b>automaker</b> was required to shed its profitable AM General line of commercial and military vehicles because of U.S. Government regulations prohibiting foreign companies from owning domestic military suppliers.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, Studebaker {{introduced}} the Avanti, featuring an exotic Raymond Loewy designed fiberglass body and supercharged engine {{mounted on a}} modified 109-inch convertible chassis and innovations such as front disc brakes. <b>The</b> <b>automaker</b> marketed the Avanti as America's Only 4 Passenger High-Performance Personal Car. The company was only able to build 4,100 Avanti cars before it closed in 1963, and sold its dealership network to Mercedes-Benz.|$|E

25|$|In July 2017, <b>the</b> <b>automaker</b> {{announced}} that beginning in 2019, {{all of its}} new models will include an electric motor in their powertrain. Implementation of the announcement could mean Volvo becoming the first manufacturer to end production of internal combustion-only vehicles, with all vehicles hybrid or electric powered. Between 2019 and 2021, Volvo plans to launch 3 electric cars under the Volvo brand and 2 more under the Polestar performance brand.|$|E
25|$|Born 5 December 1928, in Buffalo, New York, Meyers {{attended}} {{public schools}} and in 1950 earned a Bachelor of Science in engineering and in 1954 a Master of Science magna cum laude in business from Carnegie Mellon University. He joined the Ford Motor Company in 1950, but his work at <b>the</b> <b>automaker</b> was cut by military service. Meyers was {{an officer in the}} U.S. Air Force during the Korean War.|$|E
25|$|The Eagle Premier and its badge {{engineered}} variant, the Dodge Monaco, continued basically unchanged for 1992, except every model {{received the}} grille and tail lamps {{that were only}} on the Limited in 1991. Chrysler also announced {{it would be the}} Premier's final year as <b>the</b> <b>automaker</b> prepared to launch all its new LH models in the Bramalea assembly plant. Bramalea ended Dodge Monaco and Eagle Premier output on December 17, 1991.|$|E
25|$|The Lamborghini Murciélago is a {{supercar}} {{produced by}} Italian automaker Lamborghini between 2001 and 2010. Successor to the Diablo and flagship of <b>the</b> <b>automaker's</b> lineup, <b>the</b> Murciélago was introduced as a coupé in 2001. The Murcielago was first available in North America for the 2002 model year. <b>The</b> <b>automaker's</b> first new design in eleven years, {{the car was}} also the brand's first new model under the ownership of German parent company Audi, {{which is owned by}} Volkswagen. It is styled by Peruvian-born Belgian Luc Donckerwolke, Lamborghini's head of design from 1998 to 2005.|$|R
25|$|All Eagle {{models were}} now built in AMC's {{original}} factory in Brampton, Ontario, Canada because <b>the</b> <b>automaker's</b> main Kenosha plant {{was used for}} the Renault Alliance and Encore models.|$|R
25|$|The Alliance has the arguable {{distinction}} of being the car that saved AMC, {{while at the same time}} the cars possibly hastened <b>the</b> <b>automaker's</b> disappearance as an independent company.|$|R
25|$|Further test {{vehicles}} were a traditional four-door sedan body style {{based on the}} Alfa Romeo Giulietta, an altogether different platform from the 2006 mini MPV Dodge Hornet concept vehicle. Late in 2011, <b>the</b> <b>automaker</b> surprised industry pundits and insiders with an announcement that its new small sedan, {{which was to be}} revealed fully at the North American International Auto Show in January 2012, would be called the Dart.|$|E
25|$|Mitsubishi Motors {{started selling}} its i MiEV, the all-electric mini-car with a {{lithium-ion}} battery pack tucked under its floor, to retail {{customers in the}} summer 2009, a year ahead of schedule. <b>The</b> <b>automaker</b> had initially planned to start leasing the minicar-based vehicle to businesses and municipalities in the summer 2009 and to wait until 2010 for the retail launch. It has also announced its plans to offer five other e-drive vehicles.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>automaker</b> would {{continue}} to draw upon the bullfighting connection in future years. The Islero was named for the Miura bull that killed the famed bullfighter Manolete in 1947. Espada is the Spanish word for sword, sometimes {{used to refer to}} the bullfighter himself. The Jarama's name carried a special double meaning; though it was intended to refer only to the historic bullfighting region in Spain, Ferruccio was concerned about confusion with the also historic Jarama motor racing track.|$|E
