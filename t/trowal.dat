5|$|A {{wide variety}} of weather can be found along an {{occluded}} front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage {{is associated with a}} drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings warm air upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, or vice versa depending on the occlusion the front is experiencing. Precipitations and clouds are associated with the <b>trowal,</b> the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of warm air aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} form along linear {{bands of}} temperature/dewpoint gradient with significant vertical wind shear, {{and are thus}} classified as baroclinic cyclones. Initially, cyclogenesis, or low pressure formation, occurs along frontal zones near a favorable quadrant of a maximum in the upper level jetstream known as a jet streak. The favorable quadrants are usually at the right rear and left front quadrants, where divergence ensues. The divergence causes air to rush out {{from the top of}} the air column. As mass in the column is reduced, atmospheric pressure at surface level (the weight of the air column) is reduced. The lowered pressure strengthens the cyclone (a low pressure system). The lowered pressure acts to draw in air, creating convergence in the low-level wind field. Low-level convergence and upper-level divergence imply upward motion within the column, making cyclones tend to be cloudy. As the cyclone strengthens, the cold front sweeps towards the equator and moves around the back of the cyclone. Meanwhile, its associated warm front progresses more slowly, as the cooler air ahead of the system is denser, and therefore more difficult to dislodge. Later, the cyclones occlude as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes a section of the warm front, forcing a tongue, or <b>trowal,</b> of warm air aloft. Eventually, the cyclone will become barotropically cold and begin to weaken.|$|E

500|$|In the {{northern}} hemisphere, once a cyclone occludes, a trough of warm air aloft—or [...] "trowal" [...] for short—will {{be caused by}} strong southerly winds on its eastern periphery rotating aloft around its northeast, and ultimately into its northwestern periphery (also known as the warm conveyor belt), forcing a surface trough to continue into the cold sector on a similar curve to the occluded front. The <b>trowal</b> creates the portion of an occluded cyclone known as its comma head, due to the comma-like shape of the mid-tropospheric cloudiness that accompanies the feature.

500|$|A surface low {{can form}} {{in a variety}} of ways. Topography can create a surface low. Mesoscale {{convective}} systems can spawn surface lows that are initially warm core. The disturbance can grow into a wave-like formation along the front and the low is positioned at the crest. Around the low, the flow becomes cyclonic. This rotational flow moves polar air towards the equator {{on the west side of}} the low, while warm air move towards the pole on the east side. A cold front appears on the west side, while a warm front forms on the east side. Usually, the cold front moves at a quicker pace than the warm front and [...] "catches up" [...] with it due to the slow erosion of higher density air mass out ahead of the cyclone. In addition, the higher density air mass sweeping in behind the cyclone strengthens the higher pressure, denser cold air mass. The cold front over takes the warm front, and reduces the length of the warm front. At this point an occluded front forms where the warm air mass is pushed upwards into a trough of warm air aloft, which is also known as a <b>trowal.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Cold fronts {{form when}} a cooler air mass moves {{into an area}} of warmer air {{in the wake of}} a {{developing}} extratropical cyclone. The warmer air interacts with the cooler air mass along the boundary, and usually produces precipitation. Cold fronts often follow a warm front or squall line. Very commonly, cold fronts have a warm front ahead but with a perpendicular orientation. In areas where cold fronts catch up to the warm front, the occluded front develops. Occluded fronts have an area of warm air aloft. When such a feature forms poleward of an extratropical cyclone, it is known as a <b>trowal,</b> which is short for TRough Of Warm Air aLoft. [...] A cold front is considered a warm front if it begins to retreat ahead of the next extratropical cyclone along the frontal boundary, and called a stationary front if it stalls.|$|E
5000|$|Synoptic snow storms tend to {{be large}} and complex, with many {{possible}} factors affecting the development of thundersnow. The best location in a storm to find thundersnow is typically in its NorthWest quadrant (in the Northern Hemisphere, based on observations in the Midwestern United States), within {{what is known as}} the [...] "comma head" [...] of a mature extratropical cyclone. Thundersnow can also be located underneath the <b>TROWAL,</b> a trough of warm air aloft which shows up in a surface weather analysis as an inverted trough extending backward into the cold sector from the main cyclone. In extreme cases, thunderstorms along the cold front are transported towards the center of the low pressure system and will have their precipitation change to snow or ice, once the cold front becomes a portion of the occluded front. The 1991 Halloween blizzard, Superstorm of 1993, and White Juan are examples of such blizzards featuring thundersnow.|$|E

Pilot Allan Clarke, 35, a former bomber commander, radioed Vancouver Air Traffic Control to notify them of the event ("looks like we had a fire"), requested a return flight path on Airway Green 1 back to Vancouver Airport (the flight path with the most favourable terrain for an aircraft losing altitude), but inexplicably made a right turn instead of a left one and wound up heading west-southwest 12 mi south of Green 1 and straight into the border mountains.|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of a narrow, heavy, occasionally convective snowband that fell within a modest surface cyclone on 19 January 1995 is examined using gridded model output from a successful numerical simulation performed using the University of Wisconsin—Nonhydrostatic Modeling System. It is found that the snowband was produced by a thermally direct vertical circulation forced by significant lower-tropospheric warm frontogenesis {{in the presence of}} across-front effective static stability differences as measured in terms of the equivalent potential vorticity (PVe). The sometimes convective nature of the snowband resulted from the development of freely convective motions forced by frontal lifting of the environmental stratification. Model trajectories demonstrate that a stream of warm, moist air ascended through the <b>trowal</b> portion of the warm-occluded structure that developed during the cyclone life cycle. The lifting of air in the <b>trowal</b> was, in this case, forced by lower-tropospheric frontogenesis occurring in the warm-frontal portion of the warm occlusion. This <b>trowal</b> airstream accounts for the {{production of}} the so-called wrap-around precipitation often associated with occluded cyclones and, in this case, accounted for the northern third of the heavy snowband. 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} model-based {{analysis of}} the quasigeostrophic forcing for ascent in the occluded quadrant of three cyclones is presented based upon a natural coordinate partitioning of the Q vector into its along- and across-isentrope components, Qs and Qn, respectively. The Qn component describes the geostrophic contribution to {{the rate of change}} of the magnitude of =pu (traditional frontogenesis), whereas the Qs component describes the geostrophic contribution to the rate of change of direction of =pu (rotational frontogenesis). It is shown that convergence of Qs simultaneously creates the isobaric thermal ridge characteristic of the thermal structure of occluded cyclones and provides the predominant dynamical support for ascent within the occluded quadrant. The absence of significant Qn convergence there suggests that quasigeostrophic (Q-G) frontogenesis plays a subordinate role both in forcing vertical motions and in affecting three-dimensional structural changes in the occluded sector of post-mature phase midlatitude cyclones. A cyclonically ascending, cloud- and precipitation-producing airstream that originates in the warm-sector boundary layer and flows through the <b>trowal</b> portion of the occluded structure is supported by the upward vertical motions implied by the identified Q-G forcing. This airstream {{is referred to as the}} ‘‘trowal airstream’ ’ and it is shown to be responsible for the production of the ‘‘wrap around’ ’ cloud and precipitation commonly associated with occluded systems. The relationship of the <b>trowal</b> airstream to previously identified cloud and precipitation producing airflows in cyclones is discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|On 23 March 1966, thundersnow was {{reported}} {{over a period}} of 9 hours (non-consecutive) at Eau Claire, Wisconsin. This event is unique, as it constitutes the longest period of thundersnow (known to these authors) at a single station from a surface observation dataset of 226 stations spanning the years 1961 - 1990. In this study, the characteristics of a long-lived snowstorm with lightning and thunder are examined. Using model output from a simulation by the Workstation Eta (WS-Eta), we determine that the thermodynamic characteristics of the thundersnow event do not change appreciably with the evolution of the cyclone in this case. For the duration of the event, Eau Claire is north-northeast of the surface cyclone, with ample moisture, and forcing for ascent via a trough of warm air aloft (<b>trowal)</b> feature that is present upstream at 0000 UTC and then coinciding with Eau Claire at 1200 UTC. Negative equivalent potential vorticity (EPV) and conditional symmetric instability (CSI) are present in early cross-section analysis. Yet, elevated convective (potential) instability fails to develop {{toward the end of the}} event. These conclusions are bolstered by a WS-Eta run that provides an excellent meso-β simulation of the storm, with output similar to the 48 -hr precipitation field. This thundersnow event resulted largely from the prolonged existence of frontogenesis in the presence of weak symmetric stability northeast of a surface cyclone. Localized soundings also exhibit many of the characteristics found in wintertime thunderstorm cases. On the larger scale, this scenario was created and maintained by the presence of a <b>trowal</b> airstream over the Eau Claire, Wisconsin, region for an extended period...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} latent heat release on the {{development}} of the occluded thermal structure in a major winter storm is examined through comparison of full physics (FP) and no-latent-heat-release (NLHR) simulations of the event performed using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM 5). Though both simulations possess a well-developed occluded thermal ridge near the surface, the 3 D structure of their respective occluded quadrants is quite different. In particular, the FP simulation depicts the canonical, troposphere-deep warm occluded thermal structure, whereas the NLHR simulation produces only a shallow, poorly developed one. Consistent with these differences in tropospheric thermal structure, the FP cyclone displays a robust treble clef potential vorticity (PV) distribution in the upper troposphere in its postmature phase, while a considerably less robust version characterizes the NLHR simulation. The PV minimum of the treble clef overlies a poleward sloping column of warm, weakly stratified air that extends through the depth of the troposphere and is a signature of the <b>trowal,</b> the essential structural feature of warm occluded cyclones. Consequently, examination of the role played by latent heat release in production of the occluded thermal structure in this case is made through consideration of its influence on the evolution of the upper-tropospheric PV morphology. It is found that direct dilution of upper-tropospheric PV by midtropospheric latent heat release initiate...|$|E
