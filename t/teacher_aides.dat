There are three levels of funding based on the student's needs: very high, high or combined moderate. For example, a student who is totally blind or deaf is classified as very high needs, while a student who is partially sighted (6/36 or worse) or severely or profoundly deaf (71dB loss or worse) is classified as high needs. ORS funding is permanent, so it continues until the student leaves school.|$|E

50|$|During his tenure, Rattliff {{served on}} the {{transportation}} and agriculture committees, which are particularly important to District 51. Rattliff worked for passage of several bills of which the Democrats claimed authorship. One of the bills increased the penalties for drug abuse.

A third measure brought public school support staff, including bus drivers, lunchroom workers, custodians, and <b>teacher</b> <b>aides,</b> into the Kentucky state teacher retirement and insurance systems. Rattliff once said that he learned as a Kentucky Republican in the legislative minority that he would usually have to be contented to procure enactment of his desired bills, {{but he would not}} likely obtain political credit, the textbook act having been the exception to that pattern.|$|E
