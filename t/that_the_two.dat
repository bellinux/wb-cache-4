5|$|A {{number of}} authors have noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> explanations, as a {{chemical}} defence against predators {{and as a}} chemical defence against ectoparasites, are not mutually exclusive, and evidence for both explanations exists. The fact that the highest concentrations of toxins are bound in the feathers of the breast and belly, in both pitohuis and ifrits, has caused scientists {{to suggest that the}} toxins rub off on eggs and nestlings providing protection against predators and nest parasites.|$|E
5|$|A {{recent study}} of raven {{mitochondrial}} DNA showed that the isolated population from the Canary Islands is distinct from other populations. The study did not include any individuals from the North African population, and its position is therefore unclear, though its morphology {{is very close to}} the population of the Canaries (to the extent <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> are often considered part of a single subspecies).|$|E
5|$|After Bardulf's death, a {{legal case}} was brought against Bardulf's {{chaplain}} and constable, alleging that Bardulf had allowed his two servants {{to hear a}} case that should have been heard by the justice.

5|$|At a waterfall, {{another girl}} commits suicide by drowning. The girl, Carlin, looks {{identical}} to Lauren. Andrews performs an autopsy on Carlin as well, finding the same astrological symbol. It also becomes clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> girls are related—identical twins, born seven years apart. The girls are clones, produced using a technique {{similar to that}} used to create identical cattle. Black believes that this is connected to Hoffman's Earth Changes theory, that someone is breeding offspring destined to survive May 5, 2000.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} sibling of Nyuserre is known with near-certainty: Neferefre, {{who was a}} son of Neferirkare and Khentkaus II, was Nyuserre's elder brother. Since the {{relation}} between Shepseskare and Nyuserre remains uncertain, it is possible <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> were brothers too, as suggested by Roth, although the dominant hypothesis is that Shepseskare was a son of Sahure and hence Nyuserre's uncle.|$|E

5|$|At {{one point}} it was {{considered}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> former Line E stations and tunnels {{should be used for}} Line F since the line's southern terminus would be there and that part of the route would be roughly similar to the old Line E. However, it was eventually decided that the line should use new tunnels in that section due to its sharp curves.|$|E
5|$|Bearing a large bony frill {{and three}} horns on its large four-legged body, and {{possessing}} similarities {{with the modern}} rhinoceros, Triceratops {{is one of the}} most recognizable of all dinosaurs and the best known ceratopsid.

5|$|Described by Kartodikromo as an {{extended}} simile, Student Hidjo {{has been noted}} as depicting a new Indonesian youth culture which has adopted Western cultural and lingual facets. Traditional Javanese and Dutch cultural values are contrasted; from this contrast, Kartodikromo advocates a view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> are incompatible. This includes love, which is described in the novel as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find; the traditional view being that marriage {{is to be used}} for social mobility.|$|E

However, when it was revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> were different, publications still discussed how similar they were and if there was a connection between them. Bob Muir from Destructoid noted that in Birth by Sleep Ventus was the most important character by fans due to his similarities with Roxas.|$|E
5|$|During {{its early}} years, the Centre Democrats {{received}} extensive media attention on two occasions.

A group of anti-fascist activists believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> parties were planning to merge, and firebombed the hotel where the meeting was held. The venue was severely damaged, Janmaat narrowly escaped death and the party secretary Wil Schuurman had one leg amputated after jumping from a window to escape the conflagration.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of the}} 19th and 20th centuries, the United Kingdom largely {{used the}} long scale, whereas the United States used the short scale, so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> systems were often {{referred}} to as British and American in the English language. After several decades of increasing informal British usage of the short scale, in 1974 the government of the UK adopted it, and it is used for all official purposes. With very few exceptions, the British usage and American usage are now identical.|$|E
