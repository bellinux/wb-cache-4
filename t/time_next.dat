5|$|Ganguly was {{introduced}} {{into the world of}} cricket by his elder brother, Snehasish. He is regarded as one of India's most successful captains in modern times, and one of the greatest ODI batsmen of all time. He started his career by playing in state and school teams. Currently, he is the 8th highest run scorer in One Day Internationals (ODIs) and was the 3rd batsman in history to cross the 10,000 run landmark, after Sachin Tendulkar and Inzamam Ul Haq. In 2002, the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the sixth greatest ODI batsman of all <b>time,</b> <b>next</b> to Viv Richards, Sachin Tendulkar, Brian Lara, Dean Jones and Michael Bevan.|$|E

25|$|Fish {{can seem}} mindful of which {{individuals}} have watched {{them in the}} past. In an experiment with Siamese fighting fish, two males were made to fight each other while being watched by a female, whom the males could also see. The winner and the loser of the fight were then, separately, given a choice between spending <b>time</b> <b>next</b> to the watching female or to a new female. The winner courted both females equally, but the loser spent more <b>time</b> <b>next</b> to the new female, avoiding the watcher female. In this species, females prefer males they have seen win a fight over males they have seen losing, and it therefore makes sense for a male to prefer a female that has never seen him {{as opposed to a}} female that has seen him lose.|$|E

25|$|He had the unsettling {{experience}} of reading his own obituary in The Times in 1985. A misunderstanding {{led to his}} obituary being published, instead of merely updated for the files. By an unfortunate coincidence, Alston had collapsed the previous evening at a dinner, and was a patient at the Westminster Hospital at the <b>time.</b> <b>Next</b> year he remarried, and so became almost certainly the only man to have his death and marriage reported in The Times in that order.|$|E
25|$|Knowing that if A>B and B>C, then A>C, {{is another}} type of {{evidence}} for intelligence, {{and it can be}} applied in the context of dominance hierarchies. In a study with the cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni, eight observer fish could watch individual A beat individual B, then B over C, C over D, and D over E. The observer fish were then given a choice of associating with either B or D (both of which they had seen win once and lose once). All eight observer fish spent more <b>time</b> <b>next</b> to D. Fish in this species prefer to associate with more subordinate individuals, so the preference for D showed that the observers had worked out that B was superior to C, and C to D, and therefore D was subordinate to B.|$|E

Morris wrote that the vocals strongly resembled those of the Canterbury Effect, and called Taking Back Sunday [...] "a bit more rockin than the Movielife: [...] "They have cultivated punk, hardcore, emo, and pop and hybridized it better." [...] However, Morris called the album [...] "nowhere near original or creative". Rolling Stones Gil Kaufman wrote that the album [...] "sidesteps many sad-sack emo pitfalls" [...] with [...] "pop-infused hardcore" [...] and [...] "enlightened, dramatic lyrics" [...] describing [...] "heartache that teeter between despondency and dark vengeance".

500|$|The {{debut album}} from the unknown Blunt {{initially}} attracted little critical attention, {{and there were}} no published reviews from major UK music journals. His live performances, mainly in support of better known musicians, received somewhat mixed but generally favourable reviews. His lack of performing experience and inconsistent approach with audiences was commented upon, while his music was likened to that of Damien Rice and David Gray. In March 2004, with Blunt performing in the support role for Katie Melua in Manchester, Alex McCann of Designer Magazine wrote, [...] "Blunt's ascendance is a dead cert and this <b>time</b> <b>next</b> year it isn't that far removed from reality to suggest that a number one album, Brit Award and countless accolade's [...] will be his for the taking." [...] After release of the album, concert support slots for Elton John and Lloyd Cole and the Commotions in late 2004 and early 2005 followed, as did a band residency at London club 93 Feet East. In March 2005, his second single, [...] "Wisemen," [...] was released.|$|E

500|$|In a United States {{hardware}} sales {{estimate for}} July 2011 by Gamasutra following the DS Lite's price drop a month earlier, about 60 to 70 percent of approximately 290,000 DS units sold were DSi and DSi XL consoles. Lackluster 3DS sales forced Nintendo to drop its price {{to match the}} DSi XL in the United States on August 12. Japan and Europe had similar price reductions. Gamasutra speculated potential DS buyers in the United States opted for the 3DS as a result; DS sales for August 2011 decreased by 45 percent, while it combined with 3DS sales remained steady compared to the previous month. Nintendo made its second DSi and DSi XL price cuts in North America on May 20, 2012.

It concluded that the game had [...] "true creative integrity" [...] and lamented that the Saturn's failure meant it would not find a wider audience. Game Informer called it [...] "easily" [...] the best Saturn RPG, praising its graphics, story, sound, and originality, and felt it was rivaled only by Final Fantasy VII, released the previous year. Sega Saturn Magazine described the game as [...] "a monumental effort, a work of art, and quite clearly a labour of love", concluding {{that it was the}} best adventure on the Saturn. GameSpot praised its graphics, music, battle system, and story, and wrote that it was [...] "flawlessly executed" [...] and [...] "possibly the finest RPG of 1998". Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewers unanimously commended the game {{as one of the best}} RPGs of all <b>time.</b> <b>Next</b> Generation praised the battle system as a [...] "tantalizing glimpse into the future of pseudo-realtime combat," [...] but felt the game, which can be finished in less than 30 hours, was too short.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Morrissey {{returned}} to the theatre {{for the first and}} last time in nine years to play Pip and Theo in Three Days of Rain (Robin Lefevre, Donmar Warehouse). He continued to take in offers for stage roles, but turned them down because {{he did not want to}} be away from his family for long periods. Writing in Time Out, Jane Edwardes suggested that his role as Kiffer in Hilary and Jackie had inspired his casting as Pip in Three Days of Rain as the characters have similarities with each other. Morrissey was attracted to the role because the play began with a long speech and the cast and crew had only two weeks' rehearsal <b>time.</b> <b>Next,</b> he starred in Some Voices (2000), playing Pete. Morrissey researched the character of Pete, a chef, by shadowing the head chef at the Terrace Restaurant in Kensington, London and chopping vegetables in the kitchen for two hours a day. An Independent critic called him [...] "an instinctive actor who can use his whole body to convey an inner turbulence". For his next film role as Nazi Captain Weber in Captain Corelli's Mandolin (2001), Morrissey researched the Hitler Youth and read Gitta Sereny's biography of Albert Speer, Albert Speer: His Battle with Truth. Like for all of his roles, Morrissey created an extensive back story for Weber to build up the character.|$|E
