5|$|The {{development}} of distributed element filters was {{spurred on by}} the military need for radar and electronic counter measures during World WarII. Lumped element analogue filters had long before been developed but these new military systems operated at microwave frequencies and new filter designs were required. When the war ended, the technology found applications in the microwave links used by telephone companies and other organisations with large fixed-communication networks, such as television broadcasters. Nowadays the <b>technology</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found in several mass-produced consumer items, such as the converters (figure 1 shows an example) used with satellite television dishes.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Georgia Institute of <b>Technology</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> traced back to Reconstruction-era plans to develop the {{industrial}} base of the Southern United States. Founded on October 13, 1885 in Atlanta as the Georgia School of Technology, the university opened in 1888 after the construction of Tech Tower and a shop building and only offered one degree in mechanical engineering. By 1901, degrees in electrical, civil, textile, and chemical engineering were also offered. In 1948, the name was changed to the Georgia Institute of Technology to reflect its evolution from an engineering school to a full technical institute and research university.|$|E

25|$|Darin Barney {{has written}} about technology's impact on {{practices}} of citizenship and democratic culture, suggesting that <b>technology</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> construed as (1) an object of political debate, (2) a means or medium of discussion, and (3) a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship. As a setting for democratic culture, Barney suggests that technology tends to make ethical questions, including {{the question of what}} a good life consists in, nearly impossible, because they already give an answer to the question: a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology.|$|E
25|$|As a {{prescription}} {{is nothing more}} than information among a prescriber, pharmacist and patient, information <b>technology</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> applied to it. Existing information technology is adequate to print out prescriptions. Medical information systems in some hospitals do away with prescriptions within the hospital. There are proposals to securely transmit the prescription from the prescriber to the pharmacist using smartcard or the internet. In the United Kingdom a project called the Electronic Transfer of Prescriptions (ETP) within the National Programme for IT (NPfIT) is currently piloting such a scheme between prescribers and pharmacies.|$|E

25|$|Refined coal is {{the product}} of a coal-upgrading {{technology}} that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lower-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite (brown) coals. It is one form of several precombustion treatments and processes for coal that alter coal's characteristics before it is burned. The goals of precombustion coal technologies are to increase efficiency and reduce emissions when the coal is burned. Depending on the situation, precombustion <b>technology</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used in place of or as a supplement to postcombustion technologies to control emissions from coal-fueled boilers.|$|E
25|$|In October 2007, {{following}} a successful trial on the M42 in the West Midlands, the UK government have announced that two {{stretches of the}} M6 will be upgraded to allow the hard shoulder {{to be used as}} a normal running lane during busy conditions under a scheme called Active Traffic Management. The two stretches, between junctions 4 and 5 and between junctions 10a and 8, are two of the busiest sections on the entire motorway. The system could also be extended onto other stretches of the M6 as the government is going to undertake a feasibility study to determine other likely locations where this <b>technology</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used.|$|E
25|$|<b>Technology</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{viewed as}} an {{activity}} that forms or changes culture. Additionally, technology is the application of math, science, and the arts {{for the benefit of}} life as it is known. A modern example is the rise of communication technology, which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures; the rise of cyberculture has at its basis the development of the Internet and the computer. Not all technology enhances culture in a creative way; technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns. As a cultural activity, technology predates both science and engineering, each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor.|$|E

25|$|Biological {{weapons are}} {{difficult}} to detect, economical and easy to use, making them appeal to the terrorists. The cost of a biological weapon {{is estimated to be}} about 0.05 percent the cost of a conventional weapon in order to produce similar numbers of mass casualties per kilometer square. Moreover, their production is very easy as common <b>technology</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to produce biological warfare, like that used in production of vaccines, foods, spray devices, beverages and antibiotics. A major factor about biological warfare that attracts terrorists is that they can easily escape, before the government agencies or secret agencies have even started their investigation. This is because the potential organism has incubation period of 3 to 7 days, after which the results begin to appear, thereby giving the terrorists a lead.|$|E
25|$|Face {{recognition}} <b>technology</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to {{gain access}} to a person's private data, according to a new study. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University combined image scanning, cloud computing and public profiles from social network sites to identify individuals in the offline world. Data captured even included a user's social security number. Experts have warned of the privacy risks faced by the increased merging of our online and offline identities. The researchers have also developed an 'augmented reality' mobile app that can display personal data over a person's image captured on a smartphone screen. Since these technologies are widely available, our future identities may become exposed to anyone with a smartphone and an Internet connection. Researchers believe this could force us to reconsider our future attitudes to privacy.|$|E
25|$|Airflow can be {{harvested}} by various turbine and non-turbine generator technologies. For example, Zephyr Energy Corporation’s patented Windbeam micro generator captures energy from airflow to recharge batteries and power electronic devices. The Windbeam’s novel design {{allows it to}} operate silently in wind speeds as low as 2mph. The generator consists of a lightweight beam suspended by durable long-lasting springs within an outer frame. The beam oscillates rapidly when exposed to airflow due {{to the effects of}} multiple fluid flow phenomena. A linear alternator assembly converts the oscillating beam motion into usable electrical energy. A lack of bearings and gears eliminates frictional inefficiencies and noise. The generator can operate in low-light environments unsuitable for solar panels (e.g. HVAC ducts) and is inexpensive due to low cost components and simple construction. The scalable <b>technology</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> optimized to satisfy the energy requirements and design constraints of a given application.|$|E
