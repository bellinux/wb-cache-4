5|$|January 4/5, 1879: At Jacksonville at 7 pm, sleet began, {{which turned}} to rain 90minutes later.

5|$|Rounded arches, vaults, and domes {{distinguish}} Roman architecture {{from that}} of Ancient Greece and were facilitated {{by the use of}} concrete and brick. By varying <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aggregate material in the concrete, <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concrete could be altered, allowing lighter layers to be laid at the top of concrete domes. But concrete domes also required expensive wooden formwork, also called shuttering, to be built and kept in place during the curing process, which would usually have to be destroyed to be removed. Formwork for brick domes need not be kept in place as long and could be more easily reused.|$|E

5|$|De-icers spray heated {{de-icing}} fluid, often {{propylene glycol}} or ethylene glycol, onto icy surfaces {{such as the}} bodies of aircraft and road surfaces. These prevent ice from forming {{on the body of}} the aircraft while on the ground. Ice makes the surface of the wings rougher, reducing the amount of lift they provide while increasing drag. The ice also increases <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft and can affect its balance.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the eruption, {{scientists}} {{established a}} grid of benchmarks against which they measured the change {{in the shape of the}} island. In the 20years following {{the end of the}} eruption, measurements revealed that the island was steadily subsiding and had lost about one metre in height. The rate of subsidence was initially about 20cm (8in) per year but slowed to 1–2cm (0.4–0.8in) a year by the 1990s. It had several causes: settling of the loose tephra forming the bulk of the volcano, compaction of sea floor sediments underlying the island, and downward warping of the lithosphere due to <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcano.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, a new {{railroad}} {{bridge was}} constructed {{adjacent to the}} Long Bridge {{as part of a}} plan to strengthen the logistics of the Army of the Potomac as it operated in northern Virginia. An extension of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, the bridge would be used until {{the turn of the century}} before being replaced. Owing to <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railroad and the weak strength of the bridge, no locomotives were allowed on the bridge. Prior to crossing the Potomac, the train would detach its locomotive and be pulled across the bridge by a team of horses.|$|E
