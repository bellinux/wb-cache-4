5|$|However, the Protophysarum balticum from Baltic amber, first {{described}} by Dörfelt and Schmidt in 2006, is considered questionable. The fossil was {{inconsistent with the}} typical characteristics of the genus {{and it was not}} a valid publication because no Latin name was identified with it. Also, important details of its fruit bodies were not visible or contradicted the identification. Today it is assumed that the fossil belongs to a lichen similar to the genus Chaenotheca. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>known</b> discovery of a preserved plasmodium was found in amber in the Dominican Republic, and was then grouped into the Physarida. However, this claim is also considered doubtful as the publication was later classified as insufficient due to lack of evidence. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>known</b> mineralised fossils are the two spore findings from 1971, one of which, Trichia favoginea, is assumed to be from the postglacial period. In palynologian researches, by absorbing Myxogastria spores, the fossil was not recognised.|$|E
