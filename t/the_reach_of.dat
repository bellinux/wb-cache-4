5|$|Finally, Kirby also {{suggested}} that there was much scope for expanding <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> the limitations on legislative and executive power imposed by Chapter III, and drawing on another paper by McHugh, argued that this ought to extend {{to the protection of}} due process rights as implicit constitutional rights, {{in the absence of an}} explicit bill of rights.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the venture}} {{was not as}} {{profitable}} as Méliès had expected; {{the high costs of}} the lavish hand-colored film put it out of <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> many fairground exhibitors. These financial difficulties, which continued with Méliès's similarly spectacular film The Merry Frolics of Satan the following year, helped hasten the decline of Méliès's career.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} based on the Qing {{government}} water level gauge records from Wanjingtan of the Sanmenxia Gorge in <b>the</b> middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yellow River, Muluandian in <b>the</b> lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> Qinhe River, and Shijingshan and Lugou Bridge in <b>the</b> lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> Yongding River. <b>The</b> beginning of the flood season has been reconstructed. The anomaly series of the flood season is assessed using pentad scales. The sequence represents <b>the</b> middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yellow River, <b>the</b> lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qinhe River, and <b>the</b> lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> Yongding River. Within the research period, <b>the</b> middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yellow River and <b>the</b> lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qinhe River began the flood season on 6 - 10 July on average, and Yongding River began 16 - 20 July. The Yongding River is relatively stable and the start of rainy season of its upstream was basically maintained in early July. <b>The</b> middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yellow River and <b>the</b> lower <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qinhe River show great fluctuation, with discrepancies up to 3 months. The same anomalous fluctuation in the flood season <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yellow River and the Qinhe River is more obvious after the mid- 19 th century. The delay of flood season by about one pentad in <b>the</b> middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yellow River, Qinhe River, and Yongding River is in accordance with the relative low temperature of the Loess plateau in summer, while the early flood season <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yellow River and Qinhe River corresponds with the relative high summer temperature in the Loess Plateau. The beginning time of the flood season in the research area is the time the rainy season begins. The length of summer-monsoon rainy season during 1860 s- 1940 s has been reconstructed, as the Little Ice Age transformed to the Modern Warm Period in China. Rapid warming could change the summer rainy season by 2 - 3 pentads. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|After the Treaties of Tilsit of July 1807 Metternich {{saw that}} Austria's {{position}} in Europe {{was much more}} vulnerable but believed the accord between Russia and France would not last. In the meantime he found the new French Foreign Minister, Jean-Baptiste Champagny unaccommodating and struggled to negotiate a satisfactory settlement {{over the future of}} several French forts on the River Inn. Over the following months <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> Austrian policy, and Metternich's own reputation, increased. Metternich pushed for a Russo-Austrian alliance, though Tsar Alexander was too preoccupied with the three other wars he was engaged in to commit. Over time, Metternich came to see an eventual war with France as inevitable.|$|E
5|$|At the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, Howe outmaneuvered Washington {{and marched}} into the American capital at Philadelphia unopposed on September 26.

Meanwhile, to the north, Burgoyne was beyond <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> help from Howe, trapped {{and forced to}} surrender after the Battles of Saratoga. This was a major turning point militarily and diplomatically—the French responded to Burgoyne's defeat by entering the war, allying with America and expanding the Revolutionary War into a major worldwide affair.|$|E

5|$|Biotechnology in {{the modern}} sense of genetic {{engineering}} began in the 1970s, with the invention of recombinant DNA techniques. Restriction enzymes were discovered and characterized in the late 1960s, following {{on the heels of}} the isolation, then duplication, then synthesis of viral genes. Beginning with the lab of Paul Berg in 1972 (aided by EcoRI from Herbert Boyer's lab, building on work with ligase by Arthur Kornberg's lab), molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first transgenic organisms. Soon after, others began using plasmid vectors and adding genes for antibiotic resistance, greatly increasing <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> the recombinant techniques.|$|E

The sea trials started in December 2010. The ship was formally handed over to the Indian Navy on 23 September 2011, in under two years. Admiral Nirmal Verma, the chief of the Naval Staff, commissioned the tanker at Visakhapatnam, the home of the Eastern Naval Command, saying that the ship enhanced <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> the navy well beyond the limits of the Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{availability}} {{and quality of}} health care is better in Antananarivo than elsewhere in Madagascar, although it remains inadequate across the country relative to that in more developed countries. One of Madagascar's two medical schools is located in Antananarivo; most medical technicians and specialists are trained there. Neonatal and antenatal care is significantly better in Antananarivo than elsewhere on the island. Despite the presence of facilities and trained personnel, {{the high cost of}} health care places it beyond <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> most residents of Antananarivo. Pharmaceuticals are imported, making them particularly unaffordable; traditional herbal medicines remain popular and are readily available in local markets frequented by most of the population.|$|E
5|$|In the 85thminute, Scholes clipped {{the ball}} {{over the top of}} the Barcelona {{defensive}} line to Rooney, who chested the ball down for Tevez, only to be given offside. Scholes then found Rooney again on the left wing with a raking ball from deep inside his own half, but Rooney's first touch was heavy, allowing Puyol to get back and put the ball out for a corner. Rooney took the corner short to Tevez, whose cross was just beyond <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> Berbatov and diverted behind again by Puyol. Rooney also took the second corner, which was met by Berbatov, but he put the ball high over the crossbar.|$|E

But as they were often printed extremely quickly to respond to a particular event, this was expected by his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Koalas were {{hunted for}} food by Aboriginals. A common {{technique}} used {{to capture the}} animals was to attach a loop of ropey bark {{to the end of}} a long, thin pole, so as to form a noose. This would be used to snare an animal high in a tree, beyond <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> a climbing hunter; an animal brought down this way would then be killed with a stone hand axe or hunting stick (waddy). According to the customs of some tribes, it was considered taboo to skin the animal, while other tribes thought the animal's head had a special status, and saved them for burial.|$|E
5|$|McCudden {{had always}} found it {{difficult}} to intercept high-flying German reconnaissance aircraft. The latest Rumpler C.VII which had entered service proved particularly elusive.

5|$|Most of Paine's {{arguments}} {{had long}} been available to the educated elite, but by presenting them in an engaging and irreverent style, he made deism appealing and accessible to a mass audience. Originally distributed as unbound pamphlets, the book was also inexpensive, putting it within <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> {{a large number of}} buyers. Fearing the spread of what they viewed as potentially revolutionary ideas, the British government prosecuted printers and book-sellers who tried to publish and distribute it.
