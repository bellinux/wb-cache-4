50|$|<b>The</b> <b>umpires</b> went {{on strike}} again in 1979, making many realize that the game was quite {{different}} without <b>the</b> <b>umpires.</b> <b>The</b> MLUA was asking for a package of $520,000 in raises for <b>the</b> 52 <b>umpires.</b> Technically, rather than going on strike, <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> just didn't return their contracts to Major League Baseball. Several people made comments about <b>the</b> replacement <b>umpires,</b> including Phil Niekro, who said: They can be rattled. The don't know how much to take from the players.|$|R
500|$|As of the 2013 season, an on-field umpire {{receives}} a [...] salary for officiating a match. <b>The</b> <b>umpires</b> are sponsored by McDowell's No.1, whose branding is displayed on their uniforms.

2500|$|Stumps is {{also used}} as a term to {{mean the end of}} a day's play, e.g. [...] "The umpires called stumps" [...] means that <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> have {{declared}} play over for the day.

5|$|When {{a player}} is found by <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> to have {{delivered}} the ball contrary to those rules, <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> will call a no ball {{and he is}} said to have been called for throwing. Where public opinion is that a player's bowling action appears to be that he routinely throws, {{he is said to}} have a 'suspect' or an 'illegal' action, or more derogatorily, is said to be a 'chucker'. The issue is often highly emotive with accusers considering that deliveries with an illegal action are akin to cheating.|$|E
5|$|Amanda Clement {{was born}} in Hudson, South Dakota, then part of the Dakota Territory, on March 20, 1888 to Harriet Clement, one of the {{original}} settlers of Eden, South Dakota, and her husband, who died when Amanda was very young. In 1904 Clement traveled to Hawarden, Iowa to watch her brother Hank pitch in a semi-professional game. <b>The</b> <b>umpire</b> for the amateur game taking place before Hank's did not show, and Hank suggested that Amanda, who had played baseball with her brothers and was knowledgeable about the game, serve as <b>the</b> <b>umpire.</b> In so doing, Clement became the first woman paid to umpire a baseball game. Her performance was so well received that she was hired to umpire further semi-professional games.|$|E
5|$|During the 2001 season, Culbreth {{received}} {{an email from}} then-MLB official Sandy Alderson advising <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> {{that he was not}} calling enough strikes and that if he did not make adjustments, he would face criticism from ESPN analysts when he umpired a game that was broadcast by the network.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>umpiring</b> {{panel for}} <b>the</b> Grand Final, {{including}} nine match day umpires and three emergencies, was announced on Tuesday, 27 September.

5000|$|In 1999, 22 Major League Baseball umpires {{resigned}} {{since their}} {{collective bargaining agreement}} did {{not allow them to}} strike. <b>The</b> 12 <b>umpires</b> who decided not to resign were joined by 25 replacements. The umpires' posturing was unsuccessful and led to a lengthy legal battle. In the end, some [...] - [...] but not all [...] - [...] of <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> who resigned were rehired, and a new union, <b>the</b> World <b>Umpires</b> Association, was created to represent <b>the</b> <b>umpires.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fourth umpire {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>the</b> reserve <b>umpire,</b> is a cricket official. For all international matches a fourth umpire is required to perform duties like bringing on the new ball, carrying drinks on to the field for <b>the</b> <b>umpires,</b> checking <b>the</b> batteries in the light meter and observing the pitch during the lunch and tea intervals to make sure there is no interference. <b>The</b> Fourth <b>umpire</b> will take over <b>the</b> Third <b>umpire</b> duties if something happens to one of <b>the</b> onfield <b>umpires,</b> as <b>the</b> rules state <b>the</b> third <b>umpire</b> will take over on field duties.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>umpire</b> is {{positioned}} in the defensive backfield, {{except in the}} NFL, where he {{is positioned}} lateral to the referee {{on the opposite side}} of the formation. He watches play along the line of scrimmage to make sure that no more than 11 offensive players are on the field prior to the snap and that no offensive linemen are illegally downfield on pass plays. He monitors the contact between offensive and defensive linemen and calls most of the holding penalties. <b>The</b> <b>umpire</b> records the number of timeouts taken and the winner of the coin toss and the game score, assists the referee in situations involving possession of the ball close to the line of scrimmage, determines whether player equipment is legal, and dries wet balls prior to the snap if a game is played in rain.|$|E
5|$|After Ellis {{defeated}} the Reds by {{a score of}} 1-0 in a 1973 game, Joe Morgan claimed that Ellis threw a spitball. Anderson had <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> check Ellis, but found no evidence. In his 1980 book, Ellis admitted that wearing hair curlers produced sweat on his hair, which he used to throw {{a modified version of}} a spitball.|$|E
5|$|Desmond Haynes was {{the fourth}} man to be {{dismissed}} for handling the ball in Test cricket, {{just over a year}} after Mohsin. Facing India in late 1983, Haynes had been struck on the bat and pad by the ball, which then headed towards the stumps. The West Indian batsman redirected the ball away from the stumps with his free hand. Upon being given out, Haynes—who was ignorant of the law regarding handling the ball—argued with <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> about the dismissal. After asking the bowler, Kapil Dev, if he wanted to withdraw his appeal, <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> sent Haynes back to the pavilion. The first instance in One Day Internationals was in 1986, when the Indian batsman Mohinder Amarnath knocked away a turning delivery from Australia's Greg Matthews that was heading for the stumps. In 1993, Graham Gooch became the only player to be dismissed for handling the ball after scoring a century. Playing defensively to try and draw the Test match against Australia, Gooch blocked a short ball from Merv Hughes. The ball flicked off his bat and fell towards his stumps, prompting Gooch to instinctively punch the ball away: Australia won the match by 179 runs.|$|E
5000|$|... 2004 saw {{the first}} year where all sixteen teams wore a {{heritage}} guernsey. It {{was also the first}} year which the Field and Goal Umpires wore uniforms from the past as well. All <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> wore white uniforms (the traditional colour <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> wore before changing to coloured uniforms) and <b>the</b> Goal <b>Umpires</b> wore their traditional long coats and white brimmed hats.|$|R
50|$|After {{a one-day}} strike by <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> during <b>the</b> 1970 playoffs (the first games {{of both the}} ALCS and NLCS), the union was {{recognized}} by both the National and American League presidents. It then proceeded to win several pay raises for <b>the</b> <b>umpires.</b>|$|R
25|$|Starting in November 2014 from Australia's ODI series versus South Africa, {{the field}} umpires' {{communications}} {{have also been}} broadcast to the viewers. Whenever a decision is reviewed by <b>the</b> TV <b>umpire,</b> <b>the</b> <b>umpire's</b> communication with <b>the</b> field <b>umpire</b> and <b>the</b> reply incharge can be heard.|$|R
5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear skies greeted {{the players on}} the second morning. Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the latter stopped a drive from Morris with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the wicket and handed it to the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his finger in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> for blocking the ball.|$|E
5|$|If the {{selectors}} are right, Egar is wrong, {{and if he}} {{is incapable}} of interpreting the laws correctly, he should not stand in first-class cricket. On the other hand if the selectors as a body threw Meckiff into this arena merely to be tested by the opinion of a single umpire, they are very much guilty of passing the buck, and of exposing both the bowler and <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> to extreme embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|In July of that year, McAleer {{presided over}} the Blues' upset 6–1 loss to the Detroit Tigers. Although the Tigers' manager, Tommy Burns, agreed to forfeit the game for fear that <b>the</b> <b>umpire,</b> Joe Cantillon, would be injured by an angry crowd, McAleer agreed to play the Tigers using a reserve umpire. The Blues {{eventually}} closed {{the season with a}} 54–82 record, placing seventh in the eight-team American League.|$|E
2500|$|The onus for {{ensuring}} that a team complies is placed {{firmly on the}} captain who may be required by <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> to [...] "take action" [...] against any player on his team whose behaviour is unacceptable and may bring the sport into disrepute. <b>The</b> <b>umpires</b> are <b>the</b> sole judges of fair and unfair play. They are required to intervene if players are inter alia wasting time, damaging the pitch, tampering with the ball or showing disrespect to other players or to <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> themselves.|$|R
25|$|Once the {{challenge}} is invoked, acknowledged, and agreed, <b>the</b> Third <b>Umpire</b> reviews <b>the</b> play. <b>The</b> Third <b>Umpire</b> then reports to <b>the</b> on-field <b>umpire</b> whether his analysis supports the original call, contradicts the call, or is inconclusive. <b>The</b> on-field <b>umpire</b> then makes <b>the</b> final decision: either re-signalling a call that is standing or revoking a call that is being reversed and then making the corrected signal. Only clearly incorrect decisions are reversed; if <b>the</b> Third <b>Umpire's</b> analysis is within established margins of error or is otherwise inconclusive, <b>the</b> on-field <b>umpire's</b> original call stands.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Field <b>Umpires</b> were Corporal Gray and G. Barry, <b>the</b> Boundary <b>Umpires</b> were Sinton Hewitt, and E.J. Watts, and <b>the</b> Goal <b>Umpires</b> were Lieutenant A. Olsson and S.M. Keen.|$|R
5|$|In {{his first}} {{over at the}} start of the day, Johnson {{extracted}} sharp turn from one delivery that pitched outside off stump; not expecting much spin, Compton did not play a shot and was hit on the pads, but <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> rejected the loud appeal for lbw. Otherwise, Len Hutton and Compton progressed steadily, although Johnson and Toshack were able to make the ball deviate regularly.|$|E
5|$|Lavender {{created a}} {{controversy}} {{in a game}} on September23, when he was caught altering the baseball by rubbing it against an emery board that he had attached to his uniform's pant leg, an illegal act. At the time, the fine for such an infraction was a five-dollar fine. The Phillies players noticed that the pitcher was constantly scratching {{the side of his}} leg. They asked <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> to search the pitcher. Lavender refused to be searched and ran into the outfield, and <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> refused to chase Lavender. Eventually, a particularly fast Phillies player, Hans Lobert, was able to catch up with him and grab the offending item. As a result of this incident, AL president, Ban Johnson, decreed that any pitcher in his league caught using sandpaper to alter the baseball, would be suspended for 30days and fined $100. This rule became the forebearer of the rule banning other pitches as well, including the spitball. In his 37 games pitched in 1914, 28were as the starting pitcher. His win–loss record was 11–11, and he lowered his ERA down to 3.07in 214innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} of leg before wicket (lbw) is currently Law 36 in the Laws of Cricket, {{written by the}} Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Before a batsman can be dismissed lbw, the fielding team must appeal to <b>the</b> <b>umpire.</b> If the bowler delivers a no ball — an illegal delivery — the batsman cannot be out lbw under any circumstances. Otherwise, for the batsman to be adjudged lbw, the ball, if it bounces, must pitch in line with or on the off side of the wickets. Then the ball must strike part of the batsman's body without first touching his bat, {{in line with the}} wickets and have been going on to hit the stumps. The batsman may also be out lbw if, having made no attempt to hit the ball with his bat, he is struck outside the line of off stump by a ball that would have hit the wickets. <b>The</b> <b>umpire</b> must assume that the ball would have continued on the same trajectory after striking the batsman, even if it would have bounced before hitting the stumps.|$|E
50|$|The League {{recruits}} its <b>umpires</b> from <b>the</b> two <b>umpire</b> schools whose curricula {{have been}} approved by <b>the</b> Professional Baseball <b>Umpire</b> Corps.
