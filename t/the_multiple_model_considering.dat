The study included 38 mother-infant dyads. The women answered the SRQ- 20 and the Maternal-Fetal Attachment Scale in the third trimester of pregnancy, and the BDI, for evaluation of postpartum depression {{in the first month}} following birth. Maternal sensitivity was examined through an observation of mother-child interaction when babies were eight months old. <b>The</b> <b>multiple</b> regression <b>model</b> <b>considering</b> <b>the</b> three factors explained 18. 6 % of the variance in sensitivity, and only maternal-fetal attachment was a significant predictor.

Indeed, <b>multiple</b> <b>models</b> are recognized as a powerful modelling tool for nonlinear dynamic systems.

40|$|AbstractThe {{generalized}} Shiryayev sequential probability ratio test (SSPRT) {{is applied}} to linear dynamic systems for single fault isolation and estimation. The algorithm {{turns out to be}} <b>the</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>model</b> (MM) algorithm <b>considering</b> all the possible model trajectories.

Hence, the system state estimation, fault identification and estimation can be fulfilled simultaneously by a <b>multiple</b> <b>model</b> algorithm incorporating these two techniques.

40|$|Abstract Background Gene {{expression}} {{in a cell}} entails random reaction events occurring over disparate time scales. Thus, molecular noise that often results in phenotypic and population-dynamic consequences sets a fundamental limit to biochemical signaling. While {{there have been numerous}} studies correlating the architecture of cellular reaction networks with noise tolerance, only a limited effort has been made to understand the dynamic role of protein-protein interactions. Results We have developed a fully stochastic model for the positive feedback control of a single gene, as well as a pair of genes (toggle switch), integrating quantitative results from previous in vivo and in vitro studies. In particular, we explicitly account for the fast binding-unbinding kinetics among proteins, RNA polymerases, and the promoter/operator sequences of DNA. We find that the overall noise-level is reduced and the frequency content of the noise is dramatically shifted to the physiologically irrelevant high-frequency regime in the presence of protein dimerization. This is independent of the choice of monomer or dimer as transcription factor and persists throughout <b>the</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>model</b> topologies <b>considered.</b> For <b>the</b> toggle switch, we additionally find that the presence of a protein dimer, either homodimer or heterodimer, may significantly reduce its random switching rate.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{demonstrate}} some methods to integrate biophysical data with socio-economic variables with applications in {{agricultural land use}} analysis. Part of Nizamabad District of Andhra Pradesh State in India is considered for developing and testing the methods developed. First the study area is stratified as a pre-field work exercise for a focused land use analysis. Stratification of the land into categories {{on the basis of}} land use analysis objectives, such as crop management improvement, crop selection and conservation helped focus on these distinct areas with different analysis requirements. The relations between ‘land’ as a biophysical factor and its ‘use’ as a socio-economic factor were analysed using GIS techniques to spatially differentiate these categories. Two categories viz., Crop Management Improvement and Crop Selection were analysed further. Identifying yield-limiting factors in support of planning and extension agencies is the focus of study in areas identified for Crop Management Improvement. While traditional yield gap studies compared yields at research stations and in farmers’ fields, we considered yield variability among farmers’ fields in similar socio-economic and environmental conditions. In this situation, the yield gaps are mainly due to differences in management practices. What if?- scenarios, generated using <b>the</b> <b>multiple</b> goal optimisation <b>modelling</b> tool, were integrated with a stakeholder communication matrix (SCM) in the Crop Selection areas. SCM indicates the level of communication and information-sharing among key stakeholders in <b>the</b> district. <b>The</b> <b>multiple</b> goal <b>model</b> <b>considered</b> <b>the</b> aspirations of various stakeholders and the matrix presented the communication and information-sharing dynamics, understanding of which is essential for participatory land use analysis. Integration of the goal model with the SCM allowed identification of the possible bottlenecks in the implementation of the model results, allowing resource managers to initiate curative measures where required. Fuzzy modelling of farmers’ perceptions of land suitability emphasised the need for biophysical planners to consider the views of farmers while formulating land viii use options. The preference of farmers for crops was based on variables such as cropping season, soils and water availability. The study explores similarities and contrasts in the way scientists and farmers perceive land suitability...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the relationship between anorexia and sarcopenia in elderly persons aged 80  years or older. METHODS: Data are from the baseline evaluation of 354 subjects enrolled in the ilSIRENTE study. The ilSIRENTE study is a prospective cohort study performed in the mountain community living in the Sirente geographic area (L'Aquila, Abruzzo) in Central Italy. We defined anorexia as the presence of loss of appetite and/or lower food intake. According to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) criteria, diagnosis of sarcopenia required the documentation of low muscle mass plus the documentation of either low muscle strength or low physical performance. The relationship between anorexia and sarcopenia was estimated by deriving odds ratios from <b>the</b> <b>multiple</b> logistic regression <b>models</b> <b>considering</b> sarcopenia as the dependent variable. RESULTS: Nearly 21  % of the study sample showed symptoms of anorexia. Using the EWGSOP-suggested algorithm, 103 subjects (29. 1  %) with sarcopenia were identified. Thirty-four (46. 6  %) participants were affected by sarcopenia among subjects with anorexia compared to 69 subjects [24. 6  %] without anorexia (p <  0. 001). After adjusting for potential confounders including age, gender, functional and cognitive impairment, physical activity, urinary incontinence, comorbidity, congestive heart failure, COPD, depression, anti-cholinergic drugs, and TNF-α plasmatic levels, participants with anorexia had a higher risk of sarcopenia compared with non-anorexic subjects (HR 1. 88, 95  % CI 1. 01 - 3. 51). CONCLUSIONS: Anorexia is common among community-dwelling older subjects in Italy. Our results suggest that among old-old subjects, anorexia is independently associated with sarcopenia...|$|R
