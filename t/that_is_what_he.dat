25|$|Hershey {{returned}} to Lancaster in 1883. He borrowed {{money from the}} bank to start the Lancaster Caramel Company, which quickly became an outstanding success. He used the caramel recipe he had obtained during his previous travels to make candies. Also, from his previous travels, he learned that caramels sell better in bulk, so <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did. This company soon became a success when a man from England visited Lancaster. He loved Hershey's candies once he tasted them and placed a big order to be delivered to Britain. Hershey was able {{to pay off the}} debt from the bank and had some money left over to buy more ingredients and equipment.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many others}} who devoted their life to {{commercial}} art {{in the first half}} of the 20th century, Denis McLoughlin was never paid a great deal for his work. Many pieces of his artwork, the Boardman book covers in particular, which Denis had been promised would be returned to him, were either lost or ended up in private collections. While he made a living, Denis never accumulated much money. Although he had a pension from the British government, he was forced to augment his income by working long past retirement age. He once commented that he never particularly liked illustrating military topics and yet <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> found himself doing for the last 20 years of his life. Perhaps, had he been given cowboy stories to illustrate, he might have been happier.|$|E
500|$|Near {{the end of}} {{his eight}} years as Governor of Iowa, Vilsack, as head of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, campaigned for Democratic gubernatorial {{candidates}} across the nation. While on the campaign trail he gauged support for a possible presidential run. Vilsack was inspired by the results of the 2006 mid-term elections, and proclaimed that [...] "Americans sent a clear message" [...] that [...] "they want leaders who share their values, understand their needs and respect their intelligence" [...] and that <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would [...] "intend to do as president". On November 9, Vilsack filed with the FEC and announced that he had been [...] "put together the building blocks needed to run a successful national presidential campaign." [...] He made his formal announcement on November 30.|$|E
60|$|A new life! <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> waiting for. Surely he {{had begun}} it already. He had spared one {{innocent}} thing, at any rate. He would never again tempt innocence. He would be good.|$|R

500|$|Colli's troops withdrew toward Mondovì on {{the night}} of 20 April, but the move was soon {{discovered}} by the French who caught up with them at Vicoforte at mid-morning. In the Battle of Mondovì on 21 April, the brigades of Fiorella, Guieu and Elzéar Auguste Cousin de Dommartin fought their way into Vicoforte and routed the Sardinians. Dichat was killed and Henri Christian Michel de Stengel mortally wounded. Mondovì surrendered in the late afternoon. There was no looting but large requisitions of food were made from the town. Auguste de Marmont recalled of Sérurier, [...] "To form his men into three columns, put himself {{at the head of the}} central one, throw out a cloud of skirmishers, and march at the double, sword in hand, ten paces in front of his column: <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did. A fine spectacle, that of an old general, resolute and decided, whose vigor was revived by the presence of the enemy. I accompanied him in this attack, the success of which was complete". On 28 April the Armistice of Cherasco was signed, taking Sardinia out of the war.|$|E
500|$|Three {{days after}} Leiria, Benfica {{received}} PSG {{for the second}} leg. Benfica scored their first goal in the 12th minute and another before half-time. However, the Parisians {{got back into the}} game with a goal from Pauleta. Throughout the second half, Benfica threatened Mickaël Landreau's goalposts, finally scoring near the 90th minute when Simão converted a penalty resulting from a foul on Léo. Simão told the media, [...] "We knew we were stronger and had to take advantage of their mistakes. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did." [...] In the quarter-finals, Benfica were due to play Spanish side Espanyol, first in Barcelona and then in Lisbon. Domestically, Benfica played Estrela da Amadora on 19 March. Because Sporting had beat Porto in the match between them, Benfica could close up their distance {{from the top of the}} table to one point if they won. At the Estádio da Reboleira, Benfica defeated Estrela 1–0 with a goal from Petit in the 81st minute. The win left Benfica with 51 points, one fewer than Porto. The Clássico was the next match; Santos lowered [...] fans' expectations by saying the league race was open for all of the Big Three and that there were still eight match-days to go before the season's end.|$|E
500|$|Corporal Burdett later stated, [...] "When McCudden {{took off}} {{he put the}} machine into a nearly {{vertical}} climb, seemed to do a half-roll and then nosed dived into a wood.....it was usual for scout pilots to perform some little stunt.....I think <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing." [...] Witness Lieutenant L.M Fenton had a different view, [...] "the aircraft took off into wind and at about 100 feet did a vertical turn and flew back across the aerodrome {{by the side of}} the wood. The engine appeared to be running badly. The pilot rolled the machine, which failed to straighten out, at approximately 200 feet. It crashed nose down into the wood." [...] Lieutenant E.M Greenwood stated he thought the crash was the result of a failed aerobatic manoeuvre: [...] "I was watching an S.E.5 flying over the aerodrome at about 200 feet, when it did one complete roll to the right, then dived steeply to the ground behind the trees." [...] Lieutenant K.V King believed a similar thing: [...] "......very low over the aerodrome, going east towards the wood on the south-east side of the aerodrome. He had apparently been rolling. I saw him nose down and engine off entering the trees and immediately afterwards heard a crash." [...] Lieutenant [...] T.H Barry, though supports the notion that something was amiss with the engine:"I saw an S.E.5 flying from west to east across the aerodrome at 200–300 feet. The engine was firing irregularly. Just after crossing the end of the aerodrome the pilot did a sharp stalling turn. The nose dropped and it dived behind the trees. During this dive the noise of the engine ceased." ...|$|E

2500|$|Finally [...] Josias Jessop, {{the son of}} William Jessop, {{was asked}} to survey the route. He, his father and their former partner Benjamin Outram had gained wide {{experience}} in building tramways where conditions were unsuitable for canals, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> suggested. Even so, as almost the first long-distance line at , it was a bold venture. Moreover, to its summit at Ladmanlow, it would climb a thousand feet from Cromford, {{making it one of}} the highest lines ever built in Britain.|$|E
2500|$|Rafsanjani {{could not}} {{act as a}} {{political}} horse trader—for example, he could not prevent reformist candidates from being disqualified—but his role in guiding reformist politicians was a crucial one and, up to a point, {{he was able to}} influence Khamenei by preventing him from making one-sided decisions. Hardliners now have a chance to completely surround the Supreme Leader and block moderate influences. Rafsanjani played politics the way it was played during the time of Ayatollah Khomeini—or at least, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted you to believe—but with his death the so-called [...] "Imam's Line," [...] key figures {{from the beginning of the}} Revolution, who were close to Khomeini—is near its end.|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1938, Tytla {{animated}} Yen Sid, the old magician in [...] "The Sorcerer's Apprentice," [...] {{which would}} eventually become a segment in Fantasia (1940). However the character from Fantasia which Tytla {{is better known}} for is Chernabog, {{his own version of}} Crnobog the Black God, from the [...] "Night on Bald Mountain" [...] sequence. It is often said that Chernabog was based on actor Bela Lugosi, and Walt did bring him in to do live action reference for the character. However, Bill already had {{a pretty good idea of}} what he wanted to do and did not like Bela's interpretation of the character. Instead he had Wilfred Jackson (who is credited for the music of Steamboat Willie) act out the part for him, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> used as live action reference.|$|E
6000|$|... "What I need <b>is</b> you." [...] <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{ought to}} have retorted, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted passionately to say. He could not say it. His desire fought against his shyness. [...] "What I need is you." [...] Mentally he shouted the words, but not a sound issued from his lips. He looked at her despairingly. Couldn't she see <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going on inside him? Couldn't she understand? [...] "What I need is you." [...] He would say it, he would--he would.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. And there's a tobacconist's now," [...] said Trannel, as if <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> {{looking for}} all along. [...] "I want some cigarettes." ...|$|R
60|$|Renouard had {{recovered}} sufficiently to murmur coldly his regret of this waste of time. For <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what,</b> <b>he</b> supposed, the professor {{had in his}} mind.|$|R
2500|$|Melson is Jewish, and {{was born}} in Orange County, California as his father was {{stationed}} in Orange County while serving on Active Duty in the United States Army. At 10 months old, Melson's father was stationed at Fort Hamilton Army Base in Brooklyn, New York, where Nelson spent {{the majority of his}} childhood. Melson was born to an Israeli Jewish mother (Annette Melson; also an Army veteran) and a Louisiana Creole father. His maternal grandparents were Holocaust survivors from Poland. [...] He said: [...] "My grandfather, while being put onto a train en route to a death camp, escaped by sliding down the receptor tank full of defecation. It deposited him down the track allowing the train to pass over him until he could run off escaping. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did to fight for his life and allow his bloodline of Judaism to pass down to his children, and now his grandchildren in me.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Pliny then {{details the}} {{practices}} of Christians (sections 7-10): he says that they meet on a certain day before light where they gather and sing hymns to Christ as to a god. They all bind themselves by oath, [...] "not to some crimes", says Pliny, as though <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would have expected; rather, they pledge not to commit any crimes such as fraud, theft, or adultery, and subsequently share a meal of [...] "ordinary and innocent food". Pliny says, however, {{that all of these}} practices were abandoned by the Christians after Pliny forbade any political associations (hetaeriai or “fraternities”). These clubs were banned because Trajan saw them as a “natural breeding ground for grumbling” about both civic life and political affairs. One such instance of a banned club was a firemen’s association; likewise, Christianity was seen as a political association that could be potentially harmful to the empire. However the Christians seem to have willingly complied with the edict and halted their practices.|$|E
2500|$|Tafoya {{stated that}} the Comanche they were {{following}} were headed for Lost Lake (now near Dora, New Mexico) to the north-west. And he loudly declared that the hunters and soldiers would catch them there and have the water too. [...] The hunters were game as was Nolan but a curious change in description of the events were later declared. Johnny Cook's version stated that Nolan was crying and dramatic with the hunters. And the hunters felt sympathy for him and agreed to press on. Nolan's version was different and he wrote that he believed water was to be had some six or seven miles (11km) ahead as reported by Tafoya. And Nolan gave Tafoya the best horse {{to seek out the}} water. Nolan's claimed crying and weeping does not match his character. He had a goal to follow the Indians and to seek water and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did. [...] Nolan watched as Tafoya left north-westward then turn suddenly to the west for several miles then toward the north-east. Nolan followed at the pace of the slowest in his command.|$|E

2500|$|Stringer characterised Morrissey as a {{man with}} various {{contradictory}} traits, being [...] "an ordinary, working-class 'anti-star' who nevertheless loves to hog the spotlight, a nice man who says the nastiest things about other people, a shy man who is also an outrageous narcissist". He further suggested that part of Morrissey's appeal was that he conveyed {{the image of a}} [...] "cultivated English gentleman (and being every inch the typically English 'gent' he is perfectly representative of that type's loathing for cant and hypocrisy, and his fragile, quasi-gay sexuality)". Similarly, Morrissey biographer David Bret described the singer as being [...] "quintessentially English", while Simpson termed him a Little Englander. During the 1980s, interviewer Paul Morley stated that Morrissey [...] "sets out to be a decent man and he succeeds because <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is." [...] Eddie Sanderson, who interviewed Morrissey for the Mail on Sunday in 1992, said that [...] "underneath all the rock star flim-flam, Morrissey is actually a very nice chap, excellent company, perfectly willing and able to talk about any subject one cared to throw at him". Having photographed him in 2004, the photographer Mischa Richter described Morrissey as [...] "genuinely lovely".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Associated Press, Morton stated that he asked Cruise for {{an interview}}, but was turned down: [...] "I asked Tom for an interview and he declined. The Church of Scientology has got a very controversial reputation and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is linked with. An unauthorized biography would essentially be a compromise … I want to investigate it without any kind of fetters." [...] Morton consulted with private investigator and former adult film actor Paul Baressi, who investigated Cruise's private life. [...] He also consulted with Los Angeles, California attorney Graham Berry. [...] Baressi stated he had begun investigating Cruise after his marriage to Nicole Kidman ended, but after six years of research on the actor {{had not been able to}} find any evidence that Cruise was gay. [...] Baressi gave all of his research to Morton, and later told InTouch magazine: [...] "Everything I have found, and everything I know, points to Tom being heterosexual." [...] Morton also traveled to Toronto, Ontario, Canada to interview people who knew Cruise when he was filming Cocktail. [...] Several Paramount Pictures employees were interviewed about Cruise's termination by Sumner Redstone. [...] The book had initially been planned for a February 2006 publication date.|$|E
2500|$|The Monkey – A monkey {{bought by}} Weebl in [...] "Cleaner." [...] He {{is best known}} for his posh accent and pooping everywhere. In the episodes [...] "Anywhere" [...] and [...] "Anyhoo", he boasts that he can go {{anywhere}} and is unstoppable, but in [...] "Anyhoo" [...] Bob is correct when he suggests surrounding monkey with toilets, as <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> notorious for not using. This could be in relation to the fact that monkeys cannot be house-trained. Major appearances include [...] "Anywhere" [...] "Anyhoo" [...] and [...] "Team Laser Explosion" [...] (in the latter, he plays the main villains). He has been regularly shown wearing a large foam [...] "We am de best" [...] cowboy hat. Monkey appears as the Grim Reaper (in his own words [...] "Death, stealer of pie") in the episodes [...] "Art" [...] and [...] "Halloween." [...] He also portrays Santa Claus in an advent calendar short, as well as all the known villains of Team Laser Explosion. It was revealed in [...] "History 1" [...] that his ability to speak English was caused by touching a large black monolith with his tail (a reference to the film [...] ). However, since the [...] "History" [...] series isn't necessarily part of the show's continuity, this could be false.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Russian {{historian}} Boris Vadimovich Sokolov, Lend-Lease {{played a}} crucial role in winning the war:On the whole the following conclusion can be drawn: that without these Western shipments under Lend-Lease the Soviet Union not only would not have been able to win the Great Patriotic War, it would not have been able even to oppose the German invaders, since it could not itself produce sufficient quantities of arms and military equipment or adequate supplies of fuel and ammunition. The Soviet authorities were well aware of this dependency on Lend-Lease. Thus, Stalin told Harry Hopkins [...] that the U.S.S.R. could not match Germany's might as an occupier of Europe and its resources.Nikita Khrushchev, having served as a military commissar and intermediary between Stalin and his generals during the war, addressed directly the significance of Lend-lease aid in his memoirs:I would like to express my candid opinion about Stalin’s views on whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain. First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were [...] "discussing freely" [...] among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don't think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said. When I listened to his remarks, I was fully in agreement with him, and today I am even more so.|$|E
