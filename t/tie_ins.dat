5|$|The anime {{adaptation}} {{has been}} compared to Sailor Moon due to both having female protagonists; five original team members with signature colors and powers, and similar plot lines. Tokyo Mew Mew received high ratings in Japan with extensive merchandizing <b>tie</b> <b>ins</b> and marketing events to promote the series. When 4Kids announced their licensing of the anime, heavily edited and localized, fans of the series were openly dismayed and began multiple campaigns to convince the company to release an uncut version of the series. After previews of the retooled series were released, viewers were less disappointed, but still annoyed by the cultural shifting and still desired an uncut DVD release. Mew Mew Power became a successful broadcast series for 4Kids, becoming the highest rated 4Kids show {{at the start of the}} fall 2005 season, but it was never released to DVD in North America. The 4Kids dub, rather than original Japanese version, was subsequently licensed for broadcast in France, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, Greece, South Africa and Israel.|$|E
500|$|Disney was {{involved}} with the Ice Hotel in Jukkasjärvi, Sweden through association with designers Ian Douglas-Jones at I-N-D-J and Ben Rousseau to create [...] "The Legacy of the River", a high-tech suite inspired by Tron: Legacy. The suite uses electroluminescent wire to capture the art style of the film. It consists of over 60 square meters of 100mm thick ice equating to approximately six tons. 160 linear meters of electroluminescent wire were routed out, sandwiched and then glued with powdered snow and water to create complex geometric forms. The Ice Hotel is expected to get 60,000 visitors for the season which lasts December 2010 through April 2011. On November 19, 2010, the Tron: Legacy Pop Up Shop opened at Royal-T Cafe and Art Space in Culver City, California. The shop featured many of the collaborative products created as <b>tie</b> <b>ins</b> with the film from brands such as Oakley, Hurley and Adidas. The space was decorated in theme and the adjacent cafe had a tie in menu with Tron inspired dishes. The shop remained open until December 23, 2010.|$|E

5000|$|A {{music video}} {{is a short}} film {{integrating}} a song and imagery, produced for promotional or artistic purposes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Two-layer {{intestinal}} anastomosis increases the inflammatory response while single-layer anastomosis {{results in a}} better wound healing. However the four main kinds of stitches which may be chosen in performing single layer intestinal sutures never before had been comparatively studied. AIM: To compare the four more commonly used types of single layer surgical anastomosis sutures of the digestive tract. METHODS: Six mongrel dogs were operated, each one receiving two anastomosis: one at 30 cm from de Treitz angle - sero-submucosal technique, and the other at 60 cm - total technique. This placement was alternatively inverted. The four more commonly used types of single layer surgical anastomosis sutures of the digestive tract, namely: sero-submucosal stitches <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> the lumen, over the submucosa; sero-submucosal stitches <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> {{the exterior of the}} organ, over the serosa; total stitches <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> the lumen, over the mucosa; and total sutures <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> the exterior, over the serosa (Gambee's stitches) were tested. After euthanasia (7 th post-operative day) macro and microscopic features were evaluated. Friedman's test was applied for morphometry and for evaluation of the peritoneal adhesions. RESULTS: Statistical significance was demonstrated through major residual acute inflammation and proliferation in total sutures and more profuse adhesions with the sero-submucosal stitches <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> the lumen. The sero-submucosal stitches <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> the exterior over the serosa, had excellent realignment and regeneration of the layers. CONCLUSION: The sero-submucosal stitches <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> the exterior, over the serosa, were the best ones...|$|R

5000|$|In 2009, the Nepalese Family Health Division's Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Study {{published}} the [...] "shocking finding" [...] that suicide {{was the leading}} cause of death for women of reproductive age (15-49).

40|$|The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization 2 ̆ 7 s (BMDO) Miniature Sensor Technology Integration (MSTI) {{program is}} {{conducting}} {{research and development}} into advanced satellite command control architectures, including options for theater command and control by U. S. forces. Elements within the National Test Facility (NTF), Falcon AFB, CO, will use MSTI satellites as prototype test assets to develop and evaluate potential satellite command and control systems to improve future satellite control architectures and on-orbit satellite operations. The overall MSTI Concept of Operations centers around a mission control segment that is interoperable and capable of supporting multiple missions within a single core architecture. The ground segment philosophy has exploited existing and available resources for cost and schedule saving, with an emphasis to develop an operational infrastructure where responsibility is delegated down to the appropriate level. MSTI has also adopted a two tier approach to operations where primary spacecraft command and control reside within a single fixed mission control facility. The second tier centers around the ability to put direct payload commanding {{into the hands of}} the commander in the field for the best 2 ̆ 2 real time 2 ̆ 2 utilization of the space asset. Currently, SMC/Det 2 at Onizuka AFB serves as the primary command and control node for the MSTI system. However, in 1994, the MTF Center for Research Support (CERES) - an open, flexible satellite command control system with the ability to rapidly prototype new C 3 concepts - will use MSTI as a vehicle for improved architecture development and evaluation. MSTI will also use the Mobile Ground Telemetry System (MGTS) as a communication node with data analysis and limited payload tasking capabilities. MGTS, a mobile self-contained telemetry station capable of worldwide deployment and developed under the MSTI program, will provide the field operator the capability to directly task the spacecraft 2 ̆ 7 s payload in real time over a specific theater of interest. The MSTI program is currently developing a 2 ̆ 2 Battlefield 2 ̆ 2 command interface that will enable direct tasking of MSTI- 2 whenever the spacecraft is within the battlefield commander 2 ̆ 7 s ground station coverage area. The initial capability will be a single command screen with an area map overlaid with latitude and longitude grid lines. The ground station will automatically acquire the satellite as it passes overhead and will indicate to the user that they have command authority of the payload. Commanding consists of a simple mouse click over the area of interest (sectioned off by lat/long grid points), and commands are sent to the vehicle to image the requested area. Preplanning and satellite initialization will be required from the primary command control node, but is transparent to the user. The MSTI- 2 ground system also has the capability to display payload data real time when the spacecraft is within sight of a ground station. Currently basic payload data analysis and manipulation tools are coupled to early field commander tasking exercises; efforts at the NTF are under way to extend this capability and will be in place sometime during the first months of the MSTI- 2 mission. The MTF also allows for rapid data dissemination via <b>tie</b> <b>ins</b> to most existing and emerging C 3 I networks, and MSTI data will be made available for useful command and control test scenarios...|$|E
