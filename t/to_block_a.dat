5|$|Early {{into his}} fifth season, Yao was injured again, this time {{breaking}} {{his right knee}} on December 23, 2006, while attempting <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>a</b> shot. Up to that point he had been averaging 26.8points, 9.7rebounds and 2.3blocks per game, and had been mentioned as an MVP candidate. Yao was unable to play in {{what would have been}} his fifth All-Star game; he was medically cleared to play on March 4, 2007, after missing 32games.|$|E
5|$|The German {{were forced}} to {{withdraw}} from the north of the Orne but Allied forces were unable to push beyond the Orne. German forces were dug-in on the opposite bank in position <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>a</b> move south. Montgomery called off an advance beyond the Orne as further attacks would be too costly for the gains made, which had inflicted much attrition on the defenders. For French public opinion the operation was a coup; civilians now believed the liberation of France was truly under way.|$|E

5|$|While the {{division}} was conducting Operation Fliegenfänger, the Second Panzer Army was developing a plan <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>a</b> large Partisan force from moving from central Bosnia into western Serbia {{to reinforce the}} Partisans. Due to issues with the availability of various units of V SS Mountain Corps, the planned Operation Rose was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|After re-signing {{for another}} year in July 2006, he {{recorded}} 10 assists over 76 games the following season. He earned his first multi-year contract in the off-season, re-signing with the Bruins. During the 2007–08 season, he was limited to 35 games due to a head injury suffered on November 26, 2007, during {{a game against the}} Philadelphia Flyers. Going down to his knees <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>a</b> puck moving into the defensive zone, opposing forward Scott Hartnell bodychecked him, using his elbow to hit Alberts' head against the boards. Alberts left the game injured, while Hartnell received a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct; he was later suspended an additional two games by the league. Alberts recovered in time to make his NHL playoff debut in April 2008, as the Bruins were eliminated in the first round by the Montreal Canadiens.|$|E
5|$|All three {{ships of}} the class entered service with the French Navy in 1916. Bretagne and Lorraine were {{assigned}} to the 1st Division of the 1st Battle Squadron, while Provence served as the fleet flagship for the entirety of the First World War. They were deployed to guard {{the southern end of the}} Adriatic Sea, based in Argostoli and Corfu, <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>a</b> possible sortie by the Austro-Hungarian fleet. The three ships largely remained in port, though Provence was repeatedly used to intimidate the government of Greece, which favored Germany during the war. In January 1919, after the end of the war, Lorraine was sent to Cattaro to guard the Austro-Hungarian fleet. She joined her sisters in Toulon in June 1919; later that year the ships formed the Eastern Mediterranean Fleet until 1921.|$|E

5|$|Barkley also possessed {{considerable}} defensive talents led by {{an aggressive}} demeanor, foot speed and his capacity to read the floor to anticipate for steals, a reason why he established his career as the second All-Time leader in steals for the power forward position {{and leader of the}} highest all-time steal per game average for the power forward position. Despite being undersized for both the small forward and power forward positions, he also finished among the all-time leaders in blocked shots. His speed and leaping ability {{made him one of the}} few power forwards capable of running down court <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>a</b> faster player with a chase-down block.|$|E
5|$|Giordano {{was named}} the 19th captain in Flames history on September 20, 2013, as he succeeded Jarome Iginla, who was traded late in the 2012–13 season. Giordano was praised by his {{teammates}} and coaches staff for both his long tenure with the franchise and for his playing style: Giordano played in all situations for the Flames, {{was one of the}} hardest workers on the team and was willing to sacrifice himself <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>a</b> shot or defend his teammates. Head coach Bob Hartley praised Giordano's influence on his teammates as the rebuilding Flames team established an identity as a squad which was noted across the league for its work ethic.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, {{a report}} {{on the quality of the}} walls around 1460 noted that on the north and east sides of Southampton, the walls were still too thin <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>a</b> cannon shot or for a man to stand on them; a wood and earth wall-walk had been built behind the walls, but this was proving very {{expensive}} to maintain. This contemporary assessment of the weakness of the eastern walls has been confirmed by modern archaeological excavation – in places it was only 0.76 m (2.49 feet) thick, compared to a typical thickness in other English town walls of around 1 m (3.28 feet).|$|E

5|$|The {{entrance}} {{was often}} the weakest part in a circuit of defences. To overcome this, the gatehouse was developed, allowing those inside the castle to control the flow of traffic. In earth and timber castles, the gateway was usually the first feature to be rebuilt in stone. The front of the gateway was a blind spot and to overcome this, projecting towers were added {{on each side of}} the gate in a style similar to that developed by the Romans. The gatehouse contained a series of defences to make a direct assault more difficult than battering down a simple gate. Typically, there were one or more portcullises– a wooden grille reinforced with metal <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>a</b> passage– and arrowslits to allow defenders to harry the enemy. The passage through the gatehouse was lengthened to increase the amount of time an assailant had to spend under fire in a confined space and unable to retaliate.|$|E
5|$|When the Negev forces {{reached the}} coastal road, they {{realized}} {{that they could not}} continue on their vehicles, which could not travel in the sand dunes {{to the west of the}} road. The vehicles were therefore left with a platoon to the south of Isdud <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>a</b> possible Egyptian retreat. The other soldiers continued on foot into the sand dunes in an attempt to flank the Egyptian positions. On the second try, the Negev forces successfully captured several key points in the village, and destroyed a cannon. Nahum Sarig, the Negev Brigade commander, later wrote that the lack of intelligence on the enemy prevented the Israeli force from continuing its assault, while the Egyptians had time to regroup.|$|E
