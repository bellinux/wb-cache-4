On {{the east end of}} the alley, up high on the north-facing wall, a giant self-portrait of Hoffman titled [...] "Projectbubble Gum" [...] is created entirely with bubble gum. The picture of the artist blowing a bubble required a tremendous amount of gum, which he was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>with</b> the help of the community. His theory is, [...] "if an individual participates in their community they will earn an invested interest in their community. The community chewed the bubblegum, and many individuals [...] as though they were a part of its creation. This instills a sense of stewardship in one’s community". Even the robotics Team 1717, featured in the book The New Cool, is depicted in neon blue gum.|$|E

[...] They crossed to the Little Big Horn and discovered their camps along its west side. [...] The other divisions were not there to help and Custer decided to go it alone. [...] Reno was ordered to open attack on the camp upstream, while Custer himself followed down the east side to attack them where villages were more concentrated. [...] He was not aware that Crazy Horse had stopped his expected aid from Crook a week before and that he was now here and ready to lead his warriors to his own army’s extermination." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was decided}} finally to {{complete}} Jean Bart {{as an integral}} battleship, with the aim <b>to</b> <b>get,</b> <b>with</b> a delay of five years, a command ship, heavily anti-aircraft armed, with a capacity of naval bombing for attack against land. She sailed from Casablanca in August 1945 to Cherbourg, the only usable French graving dock on the French Atlantic coast. She entered {{in one of the}} Brest Laninon docks in March 1946. Work progressed slowly as the Brest Navy Yards had to be rebuilt in the meantime after severe wartime destruction. The battleship emerged with a much more compact fore control tower, topped by only one rangefinder (Richelieu had two after her refit). In 1948, she received an additional bulge to limit the increase of her draught, due to the planned fitting of stronger anti-aircraft artillery; her beam reached [...] Gunnery and speed sea trials showed a top speed of more than [...]|$|E

2500|$|... "Make Me" [...] {{was written}} by Janet Jackson, Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins, Thomas Lumpkins, and Michaela Shiloh. Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers have also been {{credited}} as the song samples Fonzi Thornton's song [...] "I Work For A Livin'", written and produced by them for the 1982 Soup For One motion picture soundtrack. Darkchild, who produced music from Jackson's tenth studio album Discipline (2008), co-produced the song with her. He reported to MTV {{that he had been}} working on new material with Jackson since her departure from Island Records in September 2008. Of the new material, he commented, [...] "It's about dancing... It's all about her. It's about , 'Listen, if you really want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>with</b> me, you gotta make me feel a certain way'... We're going back to basics and fundamental sounds of Janet. We're trying to target her fans [...] the records that her fans will embrace." [...] In October 2009, Universal Music Enterprises issued a press release stating [...] "Make Me" [...] would be included in Jackson's second greatest hits album, Number Ones, a compilation of her 33 global number one singles.|$|E
2500|$|After {{three months}} of dating, Federline and Spears {{announced}} their engagement in July 2004; they were married on September 18 in a nondenominational ceremony at a residence in Studio City, California, filing legal papers on October 6. Due {{to the fact that}} Federline got in a relationship with Spears when his ex-girlfriend Shar Jackson was pregnant with her and Federline's second child, the romance between Federline and Spears received intense attention from the media, with accusations of Federline leaving Jackson when she was pregnant <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>with</b> Spears and Federline being seen as a [...] "gold digger". The controversy of his breakup with Jackson, the controversy of his relationship with Spears, the accusations of him being a [...] "gold digger", and the disparity in fame between him and Spears, all made Federline a frequent target of ridicule. Federline and Spears have two sons together, Sean Preston Federline (born September 14, 2005) and Jayden James Federline (born September 12, 2006). Federline and Spears appeared in the 2005 reality television series , which consisted of their home videos. He also appeared in the 2004 movie You Got Served, and subsequently guest-starred in an episode of [...] that premiered in October 2006. He also guest-starred on the NBC show 1 vs. 100, along with the cast of Las Vegas, in the episode [...] "Delinda's Box." ...|$|E
2500|$|England {{were said}} to be [...] "on the brink of...victory", but Australia came back thanks to two {{partnerships}} worth more than 40 to take themselves within three runs of a 2–0 series lead. First, Warne and Lee added 45 for the ninth wicket, before Warne trod on his own stumps after a full Flintoff ball and was out hit wicket. Kasprowicz came in and supported Lee well, fending off aggressive bowling from Flintoff and Harmison, and Simon Jones dropped Kasprowicz with 15 left <b>to</b> <b>get.</b> <b>With</b> Australia edging towards victory, preferring singles to risky boundaries, England were now bowling aggressive short balls at the tail-enders, hoping for short catches or to surprise the batsmen with a yorker. With four runs needed to win, Lee drove Harmison's attempted yorker towards the boundary where it was fielded. The Australians crossed for a single, leaving three runs to win with the weaker batsman Kasprowicz on strike. Harmison delivered another short ball, which Kasprowicz fended and Jones took an athletic catch down the leg side. England appealed, and Kasprowicz was given out caught by Bowden. However subsequent replays suggested that the ball contacted Kasprowicz's glove while not in contact with the bat handle, rendering Bowden's decision technically incorrect. England were nonetheless declared victors – if in almost the most narrow way possible – and the series was thus tied with three matches left.|$|E
