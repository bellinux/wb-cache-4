500|$|All day the Snowman gazes upon <b>the</b> <b>stove,</b> <b>and,</b> at twilight, {{the stove}} glows. When {{the door of}} the room is opened, the flames leap out of <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> <b>and</b> glow upon the snowman's face and chest. He is delighted. In the morning, the window is covered with frost and the Snowman cannot see the stove. He is stove-sick and cannot enjoy the frosty weather. [...] The dog warns the snowman of an {{imminent}} change in the weather. A thaw descends, and, one morning, the snowman collapses. The dog finds a stove poker used to build the snowman within his remains, and then understands why the snowman longed for the stove, [...] "That's what moved inside him...Now he is over that, too!" [...] The girls in the house sing a springtime carol and the snowman is forgotten.|$|E

2500|$|Aft of {{the settee}} on {{starboard}} is the galley. L-shaped, {{it features a}} large top opening ice box / refrigerator, [...] capacity, three burner propane stove with oven, hot and cold pressure water, and a deep double centreline sink. Outboard along the hull are numerous storage spaces and lockers for storage, including organizers for silverware and dishes. Pot storage is located below <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> <b>and</b> there is additional storage {{above and below the}} galley sink area.|$|E
2500|$|The block kitchen (or island) is a {{more recent}} development, {{typically}} found in open kitchens. Here, the stove or both <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> <b>and</b> the sink are placed where an L or U kitchen would have a table, in a free-standing [...] "island", separated from the other cabinets. In a closed room, this does not make much sense, but in an open kitchen, it makes the stove accessible from all sides such that two persons can cook together, and allows for contact with guests or {{the rest of the}} family, since the cook does not face the wall any more. Additionally, the kitchen island's counter-top can function as an overflow-surface for serving buffet style meals or sitting down to eat breakfast and snacks.|$|E
2500|$|Cope and Randolph {{travel to}} a house party at Mrs. Phillips' {{vacation}} home in fashionable Duneland. They pause along the lake shore to swim and discuss the other guests they are joining, [...] "enough fellows to look after <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> <b>and</b> the pump"(87) and the three girls. Cope believes he lacks the [...] "knack" [...] for handling the girls and {{does not want to}} acquire it. He supposes he will end up married in any case, but prefers Randolph's good fortune in remaining single. Mrs. Phillips leads a tour of her property and finds the appreciative Cope [...] "a highly civilized faun for her highly sylvan setting."(93) Cope manages a conversation with Amy and then sings with success. He warns the others that the sea is too cold for swimming and the narrator tells us that [...] "He objected to promiscuous bathing even more strongly than he objected to promiscuous dancing."(102) Cope appraises the day without any thought of the girls or Mrs. Phillips.|$|E
50|$|Keeping the air flowing {{correctly}} {{through a}} wood-burning stove {{is essential for}} safe and efficient operation of <b>the</b> <b>stove.</b> Fresh air needs to enter the wood compartment to provide oxygen fuel for the fire; as the fire burns, the smoke {{must be allowed to}} rise through <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> pipes, <b>and</b> exit through the chimney. To regulate air flow, there are damper devices built into <b>the</b> <b>stove,</b> flue, <b>and</b> <b>stove</b> pipes.|$|R

2500|$|According to {{longtime}} Bulger confidant Kevin Weeks, Bulger's {{murder of}} Paul McGonagle's brother {{led directly to}} the Mullin Gang's assassination of his mentor. According to Weeks,"One day while the gang war was still going on, Jimmy was driving down Seventh Street in South Boston when he saw Paulie driving toward him. Jimmy pulled up beside him, window to window, nose to nose, and called his name. As Paulie looked over, Jimmy shot him right between the eyes. Only at that moment, just as he pulled the trigger, Jimmy realized it wasn't Paulie. It was Donald, the most likable of the McGonagle brothers, {{the only one who}} wasn't involved in anything. Jimmy drove straight to Billy O'Sullivan's house on Savin Hill Avenue and told Billy O, who was at the stove cooking, 'I shot the wrong one. I shot Donald.' Billy looked up from <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> <b>and</b> said, 'Don't worry about it. He wasn't healthy anyway. He smoked. He would have gotten lung cancer. How do you want your pork chops?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|They joined Morshead at camp V who by {{then was}} very cold and all four {{immediately}} {{went down to}} camp IV on the North Col. On the way Morshead slipped and dragged two other man down the couloir. However Mallory managed to stop the fall and saved everyone's lives. They reached camp at 23:30 but a logistical error had meant that <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> <b>and</b> fuel had been taken to a lower camp {{so there was no}} liquid water and hence no edible food available. After surviving the night on the Col they descended to the glacier the next day but by then Somervell thought that Morshead was [...] "not far from death". Norton, the expedition leader, wrote of him, [...] "he kept going doggedly without complaint and in spite of a bad fall on an ice slope, knowing that the safety of the whole party depended on his determination to 'stay the course'". Morshead had severe frostbite to his hands and a foot and later three finger joints had to be amputated. However, at the time he hid the pain of his injuries from his colleagues.|$|E
2500|$|Technological {{advances}} during industrialization brought {{major changes}} to the kitchen. Iron stoves, which enclosed the fire completely and were more efficient, appeared. Early models included the Franklin stove around 1740, which was a furnace stove intended for heating, not for cooking. Benjamin Thompson in England designed his [...] "Rumford stove" [...] around 1800. This stove was much more energy efficient than earlier stoves; it used one fire to heat several pots, which were hung into holes on top of <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> <b>and</b> were thus heated from all sides instead of just from the bottom. However, his stove was designed for large kitchens; it was too big for domestic use. The [...] "Oberlin stove" [...] was a refinement of the technique {{that resulted in a}} size reduction; it was patented in the U.S. in 1834 and became a commercial success with some 90,000 units sold over the next 30 years. These stoves were still fired with wood or coal. Although the first gas street lamps were installed in Paris, London, and Berlin {{at the beginning of the}} 1820s and the first U.S. patent on a gas stove was granted in 1825, it was not until the late 19th century that using gas for lighting and cooking became commonplace in urban areas.|$|E
50|$|The safe {{operation}} of a wood-burning stove requires regular maintenance such as emptying ash pans (containers) beneath the wood grate. Routine cleaning of <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> pipes <b>and</b> chimney is also needed to prevent chimney fires. Creosote and soot gradually build up in stovepipes and chimneys. This could damage the chimney and spread fire to the surrounding structure, especially the roof. When soot blocks the airflow through <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> pipes or chimney, smoke can build up in <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> pipes <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> house through <b>the</b> <b>stove.</b>|$|R
