5|$|In 1961, Peveril Meigs divided desert regions on Earth into <b>three</b> <b>categories</b> {{according}} {{to the amount of}} precipitation they received.

Both extremely arid and arid lands are considered to be deserts while semiarid lands are generally referred to as steppes when they are grasslands.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to prevent the game losing players to {{counties}} or other commitments such as jobs, {{it was suggested that}} central contracts should be introduced. This was done in June 2009, with the first two going to Trent Johnston and Alex Cusack. The number of full-time contracts was expanded to six in January 2010 with support for a further nine players; the contracts were split into <b>three</b> <b>categories.</b> In January 2012 the number of contracts was increased to 23, and coach Phil Simmons highlighted the process of becoming professional as an important factor in the team's success.|$|E

5|$|The terms First World, Second World, and Third World were {{originally}} used {{to divide the}} world's nations into <b>three</b> <b>categories.</b> The model did not emerge to its end state all at once. The complete overthrow of the pre–World War II status quo, known as the Cold War, left two superpowers (the United States and the Soviet Union) vying for ultimate global supremacy. They created two camps, known as blocs. These blocs {{formed the basis of}} the concepts of the First and Second Worlds.|$|E
5|$|There are <b>three</b> <b>categories</b> {{of ritual}} in Lingbao Daoism. The first {{is known as}} the heavenly Golden Register of Rituals, and is carried out to prevent natural disasters. During the Tang Dynasty, this ritual was carried out in honour of the {{imperial}} family, but later it could be performed by anyone. The earthly Yellow Register ritual was performed to ensure the dead was at rest. The final type of ritual, which has not survived, was the human Jade Register, which was performed to ensure the salvation of mankind. Of the rituals that have survived, the Golden Register has assumed the role of the Jade register, ensuring salvation and preventing bad weather.|$|E
5|$|This {{classification}} {{was widely}} accepted but {{has also been}} criticized mainly because {{the underlying causes of}} epilepsy (which are a major determinant of clinical course and prognosis) were not covered in detail. In 2010 the ILAE Commission for Classification of the Epilepsies addressed this issue and divided epilepsies into <b>three</b> <b>categories</b> (genetic, structural/metabolic, unknown cause) that were refined in their 2011 recommendation into four categories and a number of subcategories reflecting recent technologic and scientific advances.|$|E

5|$|In the Greco-Roman {{world of}} Classical antiquity, Roman {{agriculture}} {{was built on}} techniques originally pioneered by the Sumerians, transmitted to them by subsequent cultures, with a specific emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade and export. The Romans {{laid the groundwork for}} the manorial economic system, involving serfdom, which flourished in the Middle Ages. The farm sizes in Rome can be divided into <b>three</b> <b>categories.</b> Small farms were from 18-88 iugera (one iugerum is equal to about 0.65 acre). Medium-sized farms were from 80-500 iugera (singular iugerum). Large estates (called latifundia) were over 500 iugera. The Romans had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; slaves doing work under supervision of slave managers; tenant farming or sharecropping in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farm’s produce; and situations in which a farm was leased to a tenant.|$|E
5|$|London was {{historically}} a centre {{for trade}} and arbitration, which Peter S. Smedresman, {{writing in the}} Journal of Maritime Law and Commerce divides into <b>three</b> <b>categories</b> of transaction. English commodities trading, through bodies such as the Baltic Exchange, specify that any conflicts are to be settled through arbitration in London, even when the goods being traded have {{no relation to the}} United Kingdom. London has also been a centre for arbitration on maritime issues, and insurance. However, it failed to significantly attract more modern forms of trade, such as major communications developments or high-technology projects, {{due to the nature of}} its arbitration law. These contracts normally involve large amounts of money and are administered by the International Chamber of Commerce, which rarely sent arbitration cases to London due to the individual nature of English law on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Moving rightward {{across the}} {{standard}} {{form of the}} periodic table, nonmetals adopt structures that have progressively fewer nearest neighbours. Polyatomic nonmetals have structures with either three nearest neighbours, {{as is the case}} (for example) with carbon (in its standard state of graphite), or two nearest neighbours (for example) in the case of sulfur. Diatomic nonmetals, such as hydrogen, have one nearest neighbour, and the monatomic noble gases, such as helium, have none. This gradual fall in the number of nearest neighbours is associated with a reduction in metallic character and an increase in nonmetallic character. The distinction between the <b>three</b> <b>categories</b> of nonmetals, in terms of receding metallicity is not absolute. Boundary overlaps occur as outlying elements in each category show (or begin to show) less-distinct, hybrid-like or atypical properties.|$|E
