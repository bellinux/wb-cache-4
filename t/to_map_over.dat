5000|$|Upon {{receiving}} his Ph.D. in 1947, he {{was immediately}} hired {{as an assistant}} professor in physics at Purdue. However, Benzer was inspired by Erwin Schrödinger's book What Is Life?, in which the physicist pondered the physical nature of the gene and a “code” of life. This catalyzed Benzer's shift in interest to biology, and he moved into the area of bacteriophage genetics., spending two years as a postdoctoral fellow in Max Delbrück's laboratory at California Institute of Technology,and then returning to Purdue. At Purdue University, Benzer developed the T4 rII system, a new genetic technique involving recombination in T4 bacteriophage rII mutants. After observing that a particular rII mutant, a mutation that caused the bacteriophage to eliminate bacteria more rapidly than usual, was not exhibiting the expected phenotype, it occurred to Benzer that this strain might have come from a cross between two different rII mutants (each having part of the rII gene intact) wherein a recombination event resulted in a normal rII sequence. Benzer realized that by generating many r mutants and recording the recombination frequency between different r strains, one could create a detailed map of the gene, much as Alfred Sturtevant had done for chromosomes. Taking advantage of the enormous number of recombinants that could be analyzed in the rII mutant system, Benzer was eventually able <b>to</b> <b>map</b> <b>over</b> 2400 rII mutations. The data he collected provided the first evidence that the gene is not an indivisible entity, as previously believed, and that genes were linear. [...] Benzer also proved that mutations were distributed in many different parts of a single gene, and the resolving power of his system allowed him to discern mutants that differ at the level of a single nucleotide. Based on his rII data, Benzer also proposed distinct classes of mutations including deletions, point mutations, missense mutations, and nonsense mutations.|$|E

40|$|Resilience, {{considered}} {{as the ability}} of a system to absorb and compensate pressures derived from human and natural systems, is a topic of interest in the Mediterranean region whose landscape is the joint result of social, economic and environmental factors. The present study analyses the changes in the Italian landscape over two periods (1960 – 1990 and 1990 – 2010) of the last 50 years through a composite index of environmental resilience and vulnerability to land degradation. Results indicate that the spatial distribution of this index has been considerably changed from a relatively simple geography (mainly reflecting a latitude gradient) to a more complex pattern. The level of vulnerability of southern Italian land maintained quite stable while increasing significantly in Northern and Central Italy. The (potential) resilience level decreased over time in Central and Northern Italy while growing moderately in Southern Italy. This means that important processes of environmental changes impacting landscape resilience occurred with a different spatial trend in Italy.

40|$|The aquatic planorbid snail Biomphalaria glabrata {{is one of}} {{the most}} intensively-studied mollusks due to its role in the {{transmission}} of schistosomiasis. Its 916 Mb genome has recently been sequenced and annotated, but it remains poorly assembled. Here, we used targeted capture markers <b>to</b> <b>map</b> <b>over</b> 10, 000 B. glabrata scaffolds in a linkage cross of 94 F 1 offspring, generating 24 linkage groups (LGs). We added additional scaffolds to these LGs based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis of targeted capture and whole-genome sequences of 96 unrelated snails. Our final linkage map consists of 18, 613 scaffolds comprising 515 Mb, representing 56 % of the genome and 75 % of genic and nonrepetitive regions. There are 18 large (> 10 Mb) LGs, likely representing the expected 18 haploid chromosomes, and > 50 % of the genome has been assigned to LGs of at least 17 Mb. Comparisons with other gastropod genomes reveal patterns of synteny and chromosomal rearrangements. Linkage relationships of key immune-relevant genes may help clarify snail–schistosome interactions. By focusing on linkage among genic and nonrepetitive regions, we have generated a useful resource for associating snail phenotypes with causal genes, even in the absence of a complete genome assembly. A similar approach could potentially improve numerous poorly-assembled genomes in other taxa. This map will facilitate future work on this host of a serious human parasite...|$|E

The TRT-PCR assay was designed using IS 900, ISMAP 02 and f 57 molecular targets. Specificity of TRT-PCR was first confirmed on a panel of control mycobacterial Map and non-Map strains and on faecal samples from Map-negative cows (n = 35) and from Map-positive cows (n = 20). The TRTPCR assay was compared to direct examination after Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining and to culture on 197 faecal samples collected serially from five calves experimentally exposed <b>to</b> <b>Map</b> <b>over</b> a 3 -year period during the sub-clinical phase of the disease.

ZN agreement with TRT-PCR was not good (kappa = 0. 02). Sequence analysis of IS 900 amplicons from three single IS 900 positive samples confirmed the true Map positivity of the samples. Highly specific IS 900 amplification suggests therefore that each single IS 900 positive sample from experimentally exposed animals was a true Map-positive specimen.

40|$|Advancements in {{next-generation}} sequencing technology have enabled whole genome re-sequencing in many species providing unprecedented discovery and characterization of molecular polymorphisms. There are limitations, however, to {{next-generation sequencing}} approaches for species with large complex genomes such as barley and wheat. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) {{has been developed}} {{as a tool for}} association studies and genomics-assisted breeding in a range of species including those with complex genomes. GBS uses restriction enzymes for targeted complexity reduction followed by multiplex sequencing to produce high-quality polymorphism data at a relatively low per sample cost. Here we present a GBS approach for species that currently lack a reference genome sequence. We developed a novel two-enzyme GBS protocol and genotyped bi-parental barley and wheat populations to develop a genetically anchored reference map of identified SNPs and tags. We were able <b>to</b> <b>map</b> <b>over</b> 34, 000 SNPs and 240, 000 tags onto the Oregon Wolfe Barley reference map, and 20, 000 SNPs and 367, 000 tags on the Synthetic W 9784 × Opata 85 (SynOpDH) wheat reference map. To further evaluate GBS in wheat, we also constructed a de novo genetic map using only SNP markers from the GBS data. The GBS approach presented here provides a powerful method of developing high-density markers in species without a sequenced genome while providing valuable tools for anchoring and ordering physical maps and whole-genome shotgun sequence. Development of the sequenced reference genome(s) will in turn increase the utility of GBS data enabling physical mapping of genes and haplotype imputation of missing data. Finally, as a result of low per-sample costs, GBS will have broad application in genomics-assisted plant breeding programs...|$|E

40|$|Hydroclimatic {{risks and}} {{adaptive}} capacity are not distributed evenly in large river basins of federal countries, where authority is divided across national and territorial governments. Transboundary river basins {{are a major}} test of federal systems of governance because key management roles exist at all levels. This paper examines the evolution and design of interstate water allocation institutions in semi-arid federal rivers prone to drought extremes, climatic variability and intensified competition for scarce water. We conceptualize, categorize and compare federal rivers as social-ecological systems to analyse the relationship between governance arrangements and hydroclimatic risks. A diagnostic approach is used <b>to</b> <b>map</b> <b>over</b> 300 federal rivers and classify the hydroclimatic risks of three semi-arid federal rivers {{with a long history}} of interstate allocation tensions: the Colorado River (USA/Mexico), Ebro River (Spain) and Murray-Darling River (Australia). Case studies review the evolution and design of water allocation institutions. Three institutional design trends have emerged: adoption of proportional interstate allocation rules; emergence of multi-layered river basin governance arrangements for planning, conflict resolution and joint monitoring; and new flexibility to adjust historic allocation patterns. Proportional allocation rules apportion water between states based on a share of available water, not a fixed volume or priority. Interstate allocation reform efforts in the Colorado and Murray-Darling rivers indicate that proportional allocation rules are prevalent for upstream states, while downstream states seek reliable deliveries of fixed volumes to increase water security. River basin governance arrangements establish new venues for multilayered planning, monitoring and conflict resolution to balance self governance by users and states with basin-wide coordination. Flexibility to adjust historic allocation agreements, without risk of defection or costly court action, also provides adaptive capacity to manage climatic variability and shifting values. Future research should develop evidence about pathways to adaptive capacity in different classes of federal rivers, while acknowledging limits to transferability and the need for context-sensitive design...|$|E

We observed the same lines in selected regions of NGC 4351, NGC 4294, and NGC 4424. The CO observations are combined with Herschel maps in 5 bands between 100 - 500 μm from the HeViCS survey, and with HI data from the VIVA survey, to obtain spatially resolved dust and gas distributions. We studied the environmental dependencies by adding to our sample eight galaxies with 12 CO(1 - 0) maps from the literature. We estimate the integrated mass of molecular hydrogen for the galaxies observed in the CO lines. We find molecular-to-total gas mass fractions between 0. 04 ≤ fmol ≤ 0. 65, with the lowest values for the dimmest galaxy in the B-band. The integrated dust-to-gas ratio ranges between 0. 011 and 0. 004. For the 12 mapped galaxies we derive the radial distributions of the atomic gas, molecular gas, and dust. We also study the effect of different CO-to-H 2 conversion factors. Both the molecular gas and the dust distributions show steeper radial profiles for HI-deficient galaxies and the average dust-to-gas ratio for these galaxies increases or stays radially constant. On scales of ∼ 3 kpc, we find {{a strong correlation between}} the molecular gas and the 250 micron surface brightness that is tighter than average for non-deficient galaxies. The correlation becomes linear if we consider the total gas surface mass density. However, the inclusion of atomic hydrogen does not improve the statistical significance of the correlation.

40|$|Introduction: Strength {{training}} has, {{for many}} years, {{been used by}} athletes to improve sports performance. Recently, balance training has become popular {{to assist in the}} reduction of knee injuries. However, the underlying neuromuscular changes resulting from these different training modes have not been evaluated in a consistent, comprehensive fashion. This paper aimed to establish the neuromuscular effects from different types of training by investigating how different training affects the knee muscle activation patterns and strength on isometric and isokinetic tests as well as standing balance. The training programs were: (1) Machine-Weights; (2) Free-Weights; (3) Balance-Training; and (4) Machine-Weights + Balance training. Identifying these effects will assist in our understanding of mechanisms which change from training and their possible effect on joint stability. Methods: Fifty healthy subjects were allocated to either a control group or one of four 12 -week training programs. Subjects were tested pre and post training. Muscle strength and electromyography (EMG) for each subject were measured whilst performing isometric, eccentric and concentric leg extension and leg flexion exercises with the preferred limb on an isokinetic dynamometer. Stability tests were also conducted to assess changes in standing balance. The maximum load that subjects could lift for only three repetitions (3 RM) on their specified training apparatus was also measured. Results: All strength training groups increased strength specific to the training equipment used in their respective programs. The Free-Weights group experienced improvement on isometric and quadriceps eccentric strength, and decreases in co-contraction and greater agonist activation on the isometric and isokinetic tests. The Machine-Weights group did not experiences any significant changes in strength measures on the isometric and isokinetic tests, however there were some decreases in co-contraction. Balance training resulted in increased hamstring muscle activation and flexor torque, as well a decrease in extensor torque. Improvements in the standing balance measures were also seen groups that underwent balance training (reported changes are significant, p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Conclusion: Different types of training elicit a variety of neuromuscular changes on controlled tests. These provide greater understanding of the mechanisms resulting from training, which have the potential <b>to</b> <b>map</b> <b>over</b> into sporting manoeuvres, with possible effects on joint stability and support. However, smaller than expected changes were measured, especially with no significant strength increases measured on the isometric and isokinetic tests following some training, even though improvements in strength were observed on the training equipment. This indicates that these tests are not sensitive all outcome measures...|$|E
40|$|This master {{thesis is}} a study on female names at Voss and in the Northern and inner parts of Hardanger found in the censuses from 1801, 1865 and 1900. Through this thesis, it will be {{revealed}} how the female names have been modernized and to what degree this modernization occurs. The two main regions in the study are parted into six smaller districts {{which will be the}} main focus of this investigation. Firstly, it is created an overview over the amount of women, name occurrences and the lexical names for each of the six areas. Secondly, the origins of the names are studied which will show that the distribution of name origins changes. It is revealed that there are fewer Nordic lexical names and name occurrences {{at the same time as}} the Christian names and names of other origins increase strongly through the periods in question. It is possible to see small variations between the two main areas examined, but there are also some smaller areas which stand out more. Women who are born outside the regions studied seem to be the ones who initiate this development, and it is also obvious that the name occurrences of other origins are especially extensive amongst younger women in 1865 and 1900. During this period some lexical names with origins from other languages stand out as new in the examined areas, but these only make out relatively few name occurrences. The most central names in each census will thus be studied in order to see what similarities and differences one can find between the various areas, and which changes it is possible <b>to</b> <b>map</b> <b>over</b> time. Consequently, it is seen that there is a large degree of stability of which lexical names are more widely used, but one can also observe a development which places the Christian names on the top lists. It is interesting to see that the names which are found on the top list in three and two of the areas in 1801, rarely cross the border between Voss and Hardanger. However, this boundary seems to become less visible in 1865. To which degree one can speak of stability or change in the total amount of lexical names, will be studied as one examines which lexical names disappear and which lexical names occur during a period of about 100 years. Accordingly, one will find that some of the lexical names disappear and that very many reoccur. Nevertheless, the result demonstrates that it is a relatively small amount of the name occurrences which belong to the names which enter the lexical name vocabulary in 1865 to 1900. Thus, it is seems that the lexical name vocabulary clearly goes through a modernizing process. However, it seems to be quite clear that the name occurrences to a large degree distribute themselves to the lexical names which are also found in the same areas in 1801. Some names which are considered modern in the 1800 s are also used. These names include double- names, -ina-names and other deflection names. Names which end in -y and names which can be linked to Nordic name renaissance also belong to modern names in the 19 th century. These types of names appear to become more widespread during the 1800 s. One can find many different double name combinations and lexical -ina-names, but they seem to make out a relatively small part of the total amount of name occurrences in the different areas. It is possible to find a certain division between the Voss region and the Hardanger region when it comes to the use of these types of names. In 1865 and 1900 one can clearly see that it is the younger age groups that carry these types of names [...] ...|$|E
