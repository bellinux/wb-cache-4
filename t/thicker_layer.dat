5|$|Some animals {{including}} cephalopods like squid {{are able}} to vary their colours rapidly for both camouflage and signalling. The mechanisms include reversible proteins which can be switched between two configurations. The configuration of reflectin proteins in chromatophore cells in {{the skin of the}} Doryteuthis pealeii squid is controlled by electric charge. When charge is absent, the proteins stack together tightly, forming a thin, more reflective layer; when charge is present, the molecules stack more loosely, forming a <b>thicker</b> <b>layer.</b> Since chromatophores contain multiple reflectin layers, the switch changes the layer spacing and hence the colour of light that is reflected.|$|E
25|$|Radiation fog {{is formed}} by the cooling of land after sunset by {{infrared}} thermal radiation in calm conditions with a clear sky. The cooling ground then cools adjacent air by conduction, causing the air temperature to fall below the dew point, forming fog. In perfect calm, the fog layer can be less than a meter thick, but turbulence can promote a <b>thicker</b> <b>layer.</b> Radiation fogs occur at night, and usually doesn't last long after sunrise, but it can persist all day in the winter months especially in areas bounded by high ground. Radiation fog is most common in autumn and early winter. Examples of this phenomenon include the Tule fog.|$|E

Portland stone lies under Tophill; the strata decline at a shallow angle of around 1.5 degrees, from a height of [...] near the Verne in the north, to just above sea level at Portland Bill. The geology of Underhill is different to Tophill; Underhill lies on a steep escarpment composed of Portland Sand, lying above a <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> of Kimmeridge Clay, which extends to Chesil Beach and Portland Harbour.

2500|$|Increased gate-oxide leakage: The gate oxide, {{which serves}} as {{insulator}} between the gate and channel, should be made as thin as possible to increase the channel conductivity and performance when the transistor is on and to reduce subthreshold leakage when the transistor is off. However, with current gate oxides with a thickness of around 1.2nm (which in silicon is ~5atoms thick) the quantum mechanical phenomenon of electron tunneling occurs between the gate and channel, leading to increased power consumption. Silicon dioxide has traditionally been used as the gate insulator. [...] Silicon dioxide however has a modest dielectric constant. Increasing the dielectric constant of the gate dielectric allows a <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> while maintaining a high capacitance (capacitance is proportional to dielectric constant and inversely proportional to dielectric thickness). All else equal, a higher dielectric thickness reduces the quantum tunneling current through the dielectric between the gate and the channel. Insulators that have a larger dielectric constant than silicon dioxide (referred to as high-κ dielectrics), such as group IVb metal silicates e.g. hafnium and zirconium silicates and oxides {{are being used to}} reduce the gate leakage from the 45 nanometer technology node onwards. On the other hand, the barrier height of the new gate insulator is an important consideration; the difference in conduction band energy between the semiconductor and the dielectric (and the corresponding difference in valence band energy) also affects leakage current level. For the traditional gate oxide, silicon dioxide, the former barrier is approximately 8 eV. For many alternative dielectrics the value is significantly lower, tending to increase the tunneling current, somewhat negating the advantage of higher dielectric constant. The maximum gate-source voltage is determined by the strength of the electric field able to be sustained by the gate dielectric before significant leakage occurs. As the insulating dielectric is made thinner, the electric field strength within it goes up for a fixed voltage. This necessitates using lower voltages with the thinner dielectric.|$|E
2500|$|Dark-skinned {{people living}} in low {{sunlight}} environments have been recorded to be very susceptible to vitamin D deficiency due to reduced vitamin D synthesis. A dark-skinned person requires about six times as much UVB than lightly pigmented persons. This {{is not a problem}} near the equator; however, it can be a problem at higher latitudes. For humans with dark skin in climates of low UVR, it can take about two hours to produce the same amount of vitamin D as humans with light skin produce in 15 minutes. Dark-skinned people having a high body-mass index and not taking vitamin D supplements were associated with vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D {{plays an important role in}} regulating the human immune system and chronic deficiencies in vitamin D can make humans susceptible to specific types of cancers and many kinds of infectious diseases. Vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of developing tuberculosis fivefold and also contributes to the development of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer. The most prevalent disease to follow vitamin D deficiency is rickets, the softening of bones in children potentially leading to fractures and deformity. Rickets is caused by reduced vitamin D synthesis that causes an absence of vitamin D, which then causes the dietary calcium to not be properly absorbed. This disease in the past was commonly found among dark-skinned Americans of the southern part of the United States who migrated north into low sunlight environments. The popularity of sugary drinks and decreased time spent outside have contributed to significant rise of developing rickets. Deformities of the female pelvis related to severe rickets impair normal childbirth, which leads to higher mortality of the infant, mother, or both. Vitamin D deficiency is most common in regions with low sunlight, especially in the winter. Chronic deficiencies in vitamin D may also be linked with breast, prostate, colon, ovarian, and possibly other types of cancers. [...] The relationship between cardiovascular disease and vitamin D deficiency also suggest link between health of cardiac and smooth muscle. Low vitamin D levels have also been linked to impaired immune system and brain functions. In addition, recent studies have linked vitamin D deficiency to autoimmune diseases, hypertension, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and incidence of memory loss. Outside the tropics UVR has to penetrate through a <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> of atmosphere, which results in most of the UVB reflected or destroyed en route; because of this there is less potential for vitamin D biosynthesis in regions far from the equator. Higher amount of vitamin D intake for dark-skinned {{people living in}} regions with low levels of sunlight are advised by doctors to follow vitamin D rich diet or take vitamin D supplements, although there is recent evidence that dark-skinned individuals are able to process vitamin D more efficiently than lighter-skinned individuals so may have a lower threshold of sufficiency.|$|E

60|$|The {{inside of}} the {{peduncle}} (fig. 2 g) was gorged, in the specimen examined by me, with immature ova. The innermost muscular layer consists of longitudinal bundles of unusual size, but placed rather far apart from each other; these do not extend to the very base of the peduncle, and at the upper end they curve inwards, almost {{to the middle of}} the under side of the diaphragm, separating the peduncle and capitulum. Outside these longitudinal muscles, there are delicate transverse ones, but apparently there are no oblique muscles in the upper part of the peduncle, as in other Lepadidæ; near the bottom, the transverse muscles form a <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> with many of the bundles running in oblique lines.|$|E
60|$|These {{negative}} results {{led me to}} try {{many more}} experiments, by placing particles {{on the surface of}} the drops of secretion, observing, as carefully as I could, whether they penetrated it and touched the surface of the glands. The secretion, from its weight, generally forms a <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> on the under than on the upper sides of the glands, whatever may be the position of the tentacles. Minute bits of dry cork, thread, blotting paper, and coal cinders were tried, such as those previously employed; and I now observed that they absorbed much more of the secretion, in the course of a few minutes, than I should have thought possible; and as they had been laid on the upper surface of the secretion, where it is thinnest, they were often drawn down, after a time, into contact with at least some one point of the gland. With respect to the minute splinters of glass and particles of hair, I observed that the secretion slowly spread itself a little over their surfaces, by which means they were likewise drawn downwards or sideways, and thus one end, or some minute [page 30] prominence, often came to touch, sooner or later, the gland.|$|E
