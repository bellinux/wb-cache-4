500|$|He {{was born}} Edgar Poe in Boston on January 19, 1809, the second child of English-born actress Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe and actor David Poe, Jr.. He had an elder brother William Henry Leonard Poe, {{and a younger}} sister Rosalie Poe. Their {{grandfather}} David Poe Sr. had emigrated from Cavan, Ireland to America around the year 1750. Edgar may have been named after a character in William Shakespeare's King Lear, a play that the couple were performing in 1809. His father abandoned their family in 1810, and his mother died a year later from consumption (pulmonary tuberculosis). Poe was then taken into the home of John Allan, a successful Scottish merchant in Richmond, Virginia who dealt {{in a variety of}} goods, including <b>tobacco,</b> <b>cloth,</b> wheat, tombstones, and slaves. The Allans served as a foster family and gave him the name [...] "Edgar Allan Poe", though they never formally adopted him.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} sales of camels, cattle, {{sheep and goats}} by Rendille, a nomadic {{pastoral}} tribe occupying the Laisamis Division of Marsabit District in Eastern Province, between August 1979 and July 1980 are presented. Prices paid to pastoralists for this livestock and prices realised by traders at various markets are also presented. The sale of the Livestock Marketing Division (LMD) of the Ministry of Livestock Development, in the purchase of cattle is also discussed at length. The next section discusses trade in the six most important items which pastoralists buy. These items are maize meal (posho), sugar, tea, <b>tobacco,</b> <b>cloth</b> and shoes. The purchase of these items can account for up to 90 % of the income got {{from the sale of}} livestock by pastoralists. The relationship between livestock and skin sales one hand and the sales of these items is shown to be a very strong one. Some of the major hindrances to trade identified in the paper include lack of capital by traders, very poor road network, long distances to markets for livestock and skins and to distributors of items desired by pastoralists, and a lack of reliable well organised markets for the products which pastoralists want to sell. It is shown that although the prices for livestock and skins were poor pastoralists managed to sell approximately 3. 3 % of their sheep and cattle, 83. 8 % of their sheep skins and 60. 4 % of goat skins. They purchased goods worth Shs 2, 804, 711 or 116 Shs per capita, despite frequent shortages of posho the main item. Finally preliminary recommendations on how to improve the marketing of livestock, skins and retail goods are made. It is suggested that provision of better markets, credit and incentive goods will result in more livestock and skin sales and the purchase of more goods from outside the district. This would make the pastoralists more commercial and open opportunities of enjoying the consumption of goods and services hitherto unavailable to them...|$|E

50|$|This contact had a {{major impact}} on the Indigenous Australians. The Makassar {{exchanged}} goods such as <b>cloth,</b> <b>tobacco,</b> knives, rice and alcohol for the right to trepang coastal waters and employ local labour.

50|$|Heavy {{sandstones}} {{from the}} area were quarried in 1883 to begin construction of this solid building along the southern banks of the Pueblo Colorado Wash. Life at Hubbell Trading Post centered around it. The idea of trading was not new to the Navajos. Native American tribes in the Southwest had traded amongst themselves for centuries. During the four years' internment at Bosque Redondo, Navajos were introduced to many new items (e.g., flour, sugar, coffee, baking powder, canned goods, <b>tobacco,</b> tools, <b>cloth,</b> etc.). When the Anglos came to trade with the Navajos, the difference was in the products exchanged, and in the changes brought about by these exchanges. Traders like Hubbell supplied these items.|$|R
25|$|There is {{significant}} evidence {{of contact with}} Makassan fishers in the rock art and bark painting of northern Australia, with the perahu featuring prominently in many locations. Studies by anthropologists have also found traditions that indicate Makassans negotiated {{for the right to}} fish certain waters. The exchange involved the trade of <b>cloth,</b> <b>tobacco,</b> metal axes and knives, rice and gin. The Yolgnu of Arnhem land also traded turtle-shell, pearls and cypress pine, and some were employed as trepangers.|$|R

6000|$|... "I now {{perceived}} that all hope of reaching Hurrur {{was at an}} end. Vexed and disappointed at having suffered so much in vain, I was obliged to resign {{the idea of going}} there for the following reasons: The Mission treasury was at so low an ebb that I had left Shoa with only three German crowns, and the prospect of meeting on the road Mahomed Ali in charge of the second division of the Embassy and the presents, who could have supplied me with money. The constant demands of Datah Mahomed for <b>tobacco,</b> for <b>cloth,</b> in fact for everything he saw, would become ten times more annoying were I left with him without an interpreter. The Tajoorians, also, one all, begged me not to remain, saying, 'Think not of your property, but only of your and your servants' lives. Come with us to Tajoorah; we will travel quick, and you shall share our provisions.' At last I consented to this new arrangement, and Datah Mahomed made no objection. This individual, however, did not leave me till he had extorted from me my best mule, all my Tobes (eight in number), and three others, which I borrowed from the caravan people. He departed about midnight, saying that he would take away his mule in the morning.|$|R
60|$|Now as {{the rival}} {{companies}} keep a vigilant eye upon each other, and {{are anxious to}} discover each other's plans and movements, they generally contrive to hold their annual assemblages at no great distance apart. An eager competition exists also between their respective convoys of supplies, which shall first reach its place of rendezvous. For this purpose, they set off with the first appearance of grass on the Atlantic frontier and push with all diligence for the mountains. The company that can first open its tempting supplies of coffee, <b>tobacco,</b> ammunition, scarlet <b>cloth,</b> blankets, bright shawls, and glittering trinkets has the greatest chance {{to get all the}} peltries and furs of the Indians and free trappers, and to engage their services for the next season. It is able, also, to fit out and dispatch its own trappers the soonest, so as to get the start of its competitors, and to have the first dash into the hunting and trapping grounds.|$|R
60|$|When {{the three}} {{survivors}} {{had reached the}} craft, Yusuf, the captain, armed his men with muskets and spears, landed them near the camp, and ascertained that the enemy, expecting a fresh attack, had fled, carrying away our <b>cloth,</b> <b>tobacco,</b> swords, and other weapons. [13] The corpse of Lieut. Stroyan was then brought on board. Our lamented comrade was already stark and cold. A spear had traversed his heart, another had pierced his abdomen, and a frightful gash, apparently of a sword, had opened {{the upper part of}} his forehead: the body had been bruised with war-clubs, and the thighs showed marks of violence after death. This was the severest affliction that befell us. We had lived together like brothers: Lieut. Stroyan was a universal favourite, and his sterling qualities of manly courage, physical endurance, and steady perseverance had augured for him a bright career, thus prematurely cut off. Truly melancholy to us was the contrast between the evening when he sat with us full of life and spirits, and the morning when we saw amongst us a livid corpse.|$|R

The Yolgnu of Arnhem Land also traded turtle-shell, pearls and cypress pine and some were employed as trepangers. While there is ample evidence of peaceful contact, some contact was hostile. Using Daeng Rangka described at least one violent confrontation with Aborigines, while Flinders heard advice from the Makassans to [...] "beware of the natives". However, rock art and bark paintings appear to confirm that some Aboriginal workers willingly accompanied the Makassar back to their homeland of South Sulawesi, Indonesia across the Arafura Sea. Women were also occasional items of exchange according to Denise Russell, but their views and experiences have not been recorded. After visiting Groote Eylandt in the early 1930s, anthropologist Donald Thomson speculated that the traditional seclusion of women from strange men and their use of a portable bark screens [...] "may have been a result of contact with Macassans".|$|R
40|$|This {{qualitative}} research study is situated within an Indigenous research methodology. The {{goal of the}} research was to develop an in-depth understanding of traditional healing {{from the perspectives of}} practitioners of traditional healing. It was important to explore the experiences of practitioners of traditional healing because there continues to be a lack of literature on this subject, as well as a significant lack of understanding and awareness about traditional healing and Indigenous Canadian people in mainstream society. The theoretical underpinnings of this research are holism and the four aspects of the self, visually represented in the Anishnaabe medicine wheel. In-depth audio-recorded interviews were conducted with 16 Indigenous people who self-identified as traditional people who use the ceremonies, medicines, teachings and Elders from their cultures in their healing work. Each participant was approached in a traditional Anishnaabe way, with <b>tobacco</b> in red <b>cloth.</b> The research questions explored their experiences as practitioners and recipients of traditional healing methods. The themes that emerged from the research articulate an in-depth understanding of traditional healing. The themes are grouped under eight categories: defining health and healing, the source of problems, the qualities of healers, guidelines for effective helping, the process of healing, integrating traditional and western methods, selfgovernment, and the strengths/limitations of traditional healing. The process of healing was the largest category of themes and it included groups of themes related to focusing on the self, giving back, using traditions, and sustaining wellness. The themes are discussed in light of the literature review on traditional healing and implications for social work research and practice are identified...|$|R

60|$|But {{this was}} not to be. The French built their forts with a keen eye for the strongest points in the wilderness, and the priests planted the cross even beyond the forts. But all around and between the forts and the missions, the traders from our colonies, which {{afterwards}} became our states, stole into the country claimed for the king of France. At that time, there was peace between the king of France and the king of England in Europe, and they pretended that there was peace between their nations in America. They were very civil to each other through their ministers and ambassadors, over there, but their governors and captains here never ceased to fight and trick for the ownership of the West. From their forts, built to curb the English settlers, the French set the savages on to harass the frontier of our colonies, which their war parties wasted with theft and fire and murder. Our colonies made a poor defense, because they were suspicious of one another. New England was suspicious of New York, New York of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania of Virginia, and the mother country was suspicious of them all. She was willing that the French should hold Canada, and keep the colonies from joining together in a revolt against her, when she could easily have taken that province and freed them from the inroads of the Canadian Indians. The colonies would not unite against the common enemy, for fear one would have more advantage than another from their union; but their traders went out singly, through the West, and trading companies began to be formed in Pennsylvania and Virginia. While CÃ©loron was in Ohio claiming the whole land for the king of France, the king of England was granting {{a great part of}} the same to a company of Virginians, with the right to settle it and fortify it The Virginia Company sent its agents to visit the Miamis at Pickawillany a year later, and bound them to the English by gifts of brandy, <b>tobacco,</b> beads, gay <b>cloths,</b> and powder.|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of the leading lineages inhabiting the towns of the Benaadir coast of Somalia (Muqdisho, Marka, Barawe and Warshaykh) has, in its essence, been defined by the ability to remain distinct from {{other elements of the}} wider society in which they operate. Since at least the tenth century, all of these communities have earned their livelihoods via commerce. In particular their primary role lay in obtaining goods from pastoral and agricultural Somalis (i. e. grain, ghee, hides, camels and goats) in the interior and exchanging these in the coastal ports for finished goods (i. e. <b>cloth,</b> <b>tobacco,</b> beads) with Arab and Indian merchants from abroad. Their success as mercantile communities was dependent upon their ability to maintain a monopoly as brokers between the Somalis of the interior and foreign merchants. ^ The key to their intermediate position lay in a delicate balancing act in which town elites managed to maintain social and cultural links with both local and overseas trade partners, {{while at the same time}} remaining separate from each. The end result of such cultural juggling was the creation of a coastal identity which, while closely linked to the Somali culture of the interior on the one hand and sharing strong affinities with overseas, particularly Arab, merchants on the other, was distinctly 2 Ì† 7 Benaadiri 2 Ì† 7. ^ Using oral traditions and Arabic language documents, this study examines the ways in which urban Somalis attempted to maintain their 2 Ì† 7 distinct 2 Ì† 7 position against outside pressures during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. In particular it explores how Benaadiri townspeople preserved their interstitial position through the manipulation of various elements (religious, cultural, social and, genealogical) which both linked and distinguished them from other surrounding communities. By emphasizing commonalities and diversities Benaadir societies could either draw themselves closer to their trade partners or create a discreet amount of social distance, depending upon which served their immediate interests. This work examines the evolutionary nature of this process and the ability of Benaadiri society to adapt itself to the needs of an ever changing world in its efforts to remain a distinct and functioning community down to the present. ...|$|R
60|$|On the 6th December, we arose late {{to avoid}} the cold morning air, and at 7 A.M. set out over rough ground, hoping to ascend the Ghauts that day. After {{creeping}} about two miles, the camels, unable to proceed, threw themselves upon the earth, and we unwillingly called a halt at Jiyaf, a basin below the Dobo [10] fiumara. Here, white flocks dotting the hills, and the scavengers of the air warned us {{that we were in}} the vicinity of villages. Our wigwam was soon full of fair-faced Gudabirsi, mostly Loajira [11] or cow-herd boys, who, according to the custom of their class, wore their Tobes bound scarf-like round their necks. They begged us to visit their village, and offered a heifer for each lion shot on Mount Libahlay: unhappily we could not afford time. These youths were followed by men and women bringing milk, sheep, and goats, for which, grass being rare, they asked exorbitant prices,--eighteen cubits of Cutch canvass for a lamb, and two of blue cotton for a bottle of ghee. Amongst them was the first really pretty face seen by me in the Somali country. The head was well formed, and gracefully placed upon a long thin neck and narrow shoulders; the hair, brow, and nose were unexceptionable, there was an arch look in the eyes of jet and pearl, and a suspicion of African protuberance about the lips, which gave the countenance an exceeding naivete. Her skin was a warm, rich nut-brown, an especial charm in these regions, and her movements had that grace which suggests perfect symmetry of limb. The poor girl's costume, a coif for the back hair, a cloth imperfectly covering the bosom, and a petticoat of hides, made no great mystery of forms: equally rude were her ornaments; an armlet and pewter earrings, the work of some blacksmith, a necklace of white porcelain beads, and sundry talismans in cases of tarnished and blackened leather. As a tribute to her prettiness I gave her some <b>cloth,</b> <b>tobacco,</b> and a bit of salt, which was rapidly becoming valuable; her husband stood by, and, although the preference was marked, he displayed neither anger nor jealousy. She showed her gratitude by bringing us milk, and by assisting us to start next morning. In the evening we hired three fresh camels [12] to carry our goods up the ascent, and killed some antelopes which, in a stew, were not contemptible. The End of Time insisted upon firing a gun to frighten away the lions, who make night hideous with their growls, but never put in an appearance.|$|R
