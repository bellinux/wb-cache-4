2500|$|The Sifra read [...] “For <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>My</b> servants,” {{to imply}} that God’s deed of {{servitude}} came first, and therefore, Israelites may serve others only as God permits.

2500|$|Reading [...] {{regarding}} the Hebrew servant who {{chose not to}} go free and whose master {{brought him to the}} doorpost and bore his ear through with an awl, Rabban Johanan ben Zakkai explained that God singled out the ear from all the parts of the body because the servant had heard God’s Voice on Mount Sinai proclaiming in [...] "For to me the children of Israel are servants, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> servants," [...] and not servants of servants, and yet the servant acquired a master for himself when he might have been free. And Rabbi Simeon bar Rabbi explained that God singled out the doorpost from all other parts of the house because the doorpost was witness in Egypt when God passed over the lintel and the doorposts (as reported in [...] ) and proclaimed (in the words of [...] ), [...] "For to me the children of Israel are servants, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> servants," [...] and not servants of servants, and so God brought them forth from bondage to freedom, yet this servant acquired a master for himself.|$|E

2500|$|At 5 feet, 11inches, and 185 pounds, Doll {{was small}} for a {{professional}} football player. [...] In a 1954 profile on Doll, a reporter noted, [...] "Don, who's built like a bank clerk, piano tuner, soda jerk, errand boy or -- egad -- even a sports writer doesn't look any more like a pro gridder than your cousin Joe." [...] Doll explained how he handled the disparity in size with the players he was required to tackle: [...] "I just throw a shoulder into 'em and hit 'em low. [...] If they are over two tons I aim for their shoelaces. [...] If they're medium sized (around boxcar weight) I hit for the thighs. [...] I'll admit I do not drive 'em back but I stop 'em where <b>they</b> <b>are.</b> ... <b>My</b> size is no detriment in football. [...] I rate as the No. 1 asset the 'desire' to tackle.

2500|$|Noting that [...] {{required}} the priests to offer 70 bulls over the {{seven days of}} Sukkot, Rabbi Eleazar taught that the 70 bulls correspond to the 70 nations of the world. And Rabbi Eleazar taught that the single bull that [...] {{required the}} priests to offer on Shemini Atzeret corresponds to the unique nation of Israel. Rabbi Eleazar compared this to a mortal king who told his servants to prepare a great banquet, but {{on the last day}} told his beloved friend to prepare a simple meal so that the king might enjoy his friend's company. Similarly, a Midrash taught that on Sukkot, the Israelites offered God 70 bulls as an atonement for the 70 nations. The Israelites then complained to God that they had offered 70 bulls on behalf of the nations of the world, and they ought thus to love Israel, but they still hated the Jews. As [...] says, [...] "In return for my love <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> adversaries." [...] So in [...] God told Israel to offer a single bull as sacrifice on its own behalf. And the Midrash compared this to the case of a king who made a banquet for seven days and invited {{all the people in the}} province. And when the seven days of the feast were over, he said to his friend that he had done his duty to all the people of the province, now the two of them would eat whatever the friend could find — a pound of meat, fish, or vegetables.|$|E
