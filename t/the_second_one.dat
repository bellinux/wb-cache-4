5|$|After {{the demise}} of Thrilling Wonder Stories the old Wonder Stories title was revived for two issues, {{published}} in 1957 and 1963.

Faced with pressure from the Entente, Polish Chief of State Józef Piłsudski, who was significantly involved in planning of the coup, did not want open Polish–Lithuanian hostilities, which could led to much bloodshed and even greater tensions between Poland and Lithuania. Instead, since he thought there were enough Polish sympathizers in Lithuania to stage a coup d'etat, he decided to plan one to topple the Lithuanian government.|$|E
