40|$|Antithrombotic therapy {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in the management {{of some of the most}} common and morbid medical conditions. Triple oral antithrombotic therapy (TOAT) is defined as the administration of both therapeutic oral anticoagulation (OAC) and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) to patients with indications for both treatments. The current societal guidelines regarding TOAT are derived from observational studies and some trials of the use of warfarin in addition to antiplatelet therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and a recent acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention. The general apprehension to administer TOAT is due to the heightened concern for bleeding, rendering warfarin’s pharmacokinetic properties concerning. Newer anticoagulant agents may serve as appealing alternatives, and further investigations are warranted. The results of the recent trials that have studied the use of these agents in atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome offer some useful applications <b>to</b> <b>TOAT.</b> Ultimately, selecting the most favorable antithrombotic strategy is going to involve weighing the risks and benefits for each patient...|$|E
50|$|The CLARiiON was a dual {{controller}} active/passive array, {{meaning that}} it had a mirrored write cache, but only one controller was actively serving requests for any single LUN presented to initiators.This could cause issues with unsuspecting clients, one path would always appear dead. Accesses to it would trigger a reassignment of the LUN to the other controller, a so-called trespass.This had severe implications on IO performance, and on older models like the 4500 models, this could cause a controller to crash if the system was directly (loop) attached to multiple IO-heavy hosts.The second controller would then take over the load from the first one, crash due to the additional LUN trespasses. By this time, the first controller comes up and is missing a partner <b>to</b> sync <b>to.At</b> this point, some LUNs could end up with no controller responsible for them, so-called unassigned LUNs.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} robust {{transmission}} network expansion planning (RTNEP) method with Taguchi's orthogonal array testing (TOAT) which considers generation dispatch and operating uncertainties caused by load demand {{and renewable energy}} output. TOAT is a method which has been proven to be optimal to select representative scenarios for testing from all the possible combinations. This paper employs <b>TOAT</b> <b>to</b> determine testing scenarios in transmission network expansion planning (TNEP). A new RTNEP formulation is then proposed based on the multiple testing scenarios. The simulation results have demonstrated {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed RTNEP.

50|$|Upon its {{arrival in}} Spain in September 1981, {{it was first}} {{displayed}} behind bomb-and bullet-proof glass screens at the Casón del Buen Retiro in Madrid in time to celebrate the centenary of Picasso's birth, 25 October. The exhibition was visited by almost a {{million people in the}} first year. Since that time there has never been any attempted vandalism or other security threat to the painting.In 1992, the painting was moved from the Museo del Prado to a purpose-built gallery at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, both in Madrid, along with about two dozen preparatory works. This action was controversial in Spain, since Picasso's will stated that the painting should be displayed at the Prado. However, the move was part of a transfer of all of the Prado's collections of art after the early 19th century to other nearby buildings in the city for reasons of space; the Reina Sofía, which houses the capital's national collection of 20th-century art, was the natural place <b>to</b> move it <b>to.At</b> the Reina Sofía, the painting has roughly the same protection as any other work.|$|R
