2500|$|The Mach number after <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> (...) {{is related}} to the initial Mach number (...) and <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> angle (...) by, ...|$|R
5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque and steer angle are both {{opposite}} <b>the</b> desired <b>turn</b> direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state <b>turn.</b> <b>The</b> sustained steer angle is usually in the same direction as <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> but may remain opposite to the direction of <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> direction. <b>The</b> actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> to increase lean and decrease radius, then into <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|R

5|$|Cumberbatch {{featured}} in Michael Dobbs' play, <b>The</b> <b>Turning</b> Point, which aired {{as one of}} a series of TV plays broadcast live on Sky Arts. The play depicted an October 1938 meeting between Soviet spy Guy Burgess, then a young man working for the BBC, and Winston Churchill. Cumberbatch portrayed Burgess; Churchill was played by Matthew Marsh, who had played a supporting role in Hawking. He narrated the 6-part series South Pacific (US title: Wild Pacific), which aired from May to June 2009 on BBC 2.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>turn</b> {{and slip}} {{indicator}} can {{be referred to}} as <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> and bank indicator, although the instrument does not respond directly to bank angle. Neither does <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> coordinator, but it does respond to roll rate, which enables it to respond more quickly to the start of a turn.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the folding}} of overall proteins, <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> may {{originate}} not in <b>the</b> native <b>turn</b> region {{but in the}} C-strand of <b>the</b> beta-hairpin. This <b>turn</b> then propagates through the C-strand (the beta strand leading to C-terminus) until it reaches <b>the</b> native <b>turn</b> region. Sometimes <b>the</b> residue interactions leading up to <b>the</b> native <b>turn</b> region are too strong, causing reverse propagation. However, once <b>the</b> native <b>turn</b> does form, interactions between prolines and tryptophan residues (seen in image at right) in the region help to stabilize <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> preventing [...] "roll back" [...] or dissolution.|$|R

5|$|Inchon (also called Inchon!) is a 1981 South Korean–American epic war {{film about}} the Battle of Inchon, {{considered}} to be <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> point of the Korean War. The film was directed by Terence Young and financed by Unification Church founder Sun Myung Moon. It stars Laurence Olivier as General Douglas MacArthur, who led the United States surprise amphibious landing at Incheon, South Korea in 1950. Also featured are Jacqueline Bisset, Ben Gazzara, Toshiro Mifune, and Richard Roundtree. It was filmed in South Korea, California, Italy, Ireland and Japan.|$|E

25|$|A man {{overboard}} rescue turn is a sailing maneuver usually implemented {{immediately upon}} learning {{of a man}} overboard. To maneuver closer to the person's location, implementations of the principles described are: <b>the</b> quick <b>turn</b> (also known as the Q-turn or <b>the</b> figure eight <b>turn),</b> <b>the</b> Anderson <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> Williamson <b>turn,</b> and <b>the</b> Scharnow <b>turn.</b>|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{a wave of}} {{the hand}} in the {{direction}} of <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> or a flashing of headlights by the driver going straight will indicate permission for the left-turning driver to execute <b>the</b> <b>turn.</b> Conversely, <b>the</b> driver navigating <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> may attempt to signal the other driver for permission to do so, with similar hand motions or headlight signals. Furthermore, simply a delay by the straight-bound car can often initiate the signal, and give the left turner time to go and make <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> especially in large intersections.|$|R
5|$|Modeled on The Lord of the Rings, the Ice and Fire {{story begins}} with a tight focus on a small group (with {{everyone}} in Winterfell, except Daenerys) and then splits into separate stories. The storylines are to converge again, but finding <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> point in this complex series has been difficult for Martin and has slowed down his writing. Depending on the interview, Martin {{is said to have}} reached <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> point in A Dance with Dragons, or to not quite have reached it yet in the books. The series' structure of multiple POVs and interwoven storylines was inspired by Wild Cards, a multi-authored shared universe book series edited by Martin since 1985. As the sole author, Martin begins each new book with an outline of the chapter order and may write a few successive chapters from a single character's viewpoint instead of working chronologically. The chapters are later rearranged to optimize character intercutting, chronology, and suspense.|$|E

5|$|The Confederate {{surrender}} on July 4, 1863, {{is sometimes}} considered, {{when combined with}} Gen. Robert E. Lee's defeat at Gettysburg by Maj. Gen. George Meade and retreat beginning the same day, <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> point of the war. It cut off the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas {{from the rest of}} the Confederate States, effectively splitting the Confederacy in two for the duration of the war. The Union victory also permanently severed communication between the balance of the Confederacy and the Trans-Mississippi Department.|$|E
50|$|The pivot on the {{hindquarters}} (or spin) {{is commonly}} seen in reining, and asks {{the horse to}} ground the inside hind leg and pivot forelegs around that point. <b>The</b> <b>turn</b> on <b>the</b> center asks <b>the</b> horse to <b>turn</b> around an imaginary pivot point located {{at the center of}} his barrel. The horse bends in the direction of <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> moving his forehand in the direction of <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> and his hind end in the opposite direction. This allows <b>the</b> horse to <b>turn</b> in a very confined area. Neither movement is practiced today in dressage (although <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> on <b>the</b> center used to be a training movement in the 18th century).|$|R

5|$|The Isidore H. Heller House {{is a house}} {{located at}} 5132 South Woodlawn Avenue in the Hyde Park {{community}} area of Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, United States. The house was designed by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The design is credited as one of <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> points in Wright's shift to geometric, Prairie School architecture, which is defined by horizontal lines, flat or hipped roofs with broad overhanging eaves, windows grouped in horizontal bands, and an integration with the landscape, which is meant to evoke native Prairie surroundings.|$|E
5|$|The Union counteroffensive never came; the Army of the Potomac was {{exhausted}} and nearly as damaged {{at the end}} of the three days as the Army of Northern Virginia. Meade was content to hold the field. On July 4, the armies observed an informal truce and collected their dead and wounded. Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant accepted the surrender of the Vicksburg garrison along the Mississippi River, splitting the Confederacy in two. These two Union victories are generally considered <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> point of the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle has}} gone {{down in history as}} one of <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> points of the War of the Spanish Succession.
