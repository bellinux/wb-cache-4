500|$|Gil's {{interest}} in music was precocious: [...] "When I {{was only two}} or two and a half," [...] he recalled, [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> I {{was going to become}} a musician or a president of my country." [...] He grew up listening to the forró music of his native northeast, and took an {{interest in}} the street performers of Salvador. Early on, he began to play the drums and the trumpet, through listening to Bob Nelson on the radio. Gil's mother was the [...] "chief supporter" [...] in his musical ambitions; she bought him an accordion and, when he was ten years old, sent him to music school in Salvador which he attended for four years. As an accordionist, Gil first played classical music, but grew more interested in the folk and popular music of Brazil. He was particularly influenced by singer and accordion player Luiz Gonzaga; he began to sing and play the accordion in an emulation of Gonzaga's recordings. Gil has noted that he grew to identify with Gonzaga [...] "because he sang about the world around , the world that [...] encountered." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lane {{was born}} in Austin, Texas, in April 1928. [...] When he was three months old, he was {{abandoned}} by his birth parents, a prostitute and pimp. He was found, covered in newspapers, in a dumpster. Lane later recalled, [...] "My father was called Texas Slim. I never saw him - I don't know if he's the one that <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> to throw me away. A pimp <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> I had to go. They {{put me in a}} trash can and took off. Some people heard me crying. They thought it was a cat." ...|$|E
2500|$|George Osborne {{was born}} in Paddington, London, as Gideon Oliver Osborne; he decided when he was 13 to be known by the {{additional}} first name of 'George'. In an interview in July 2005, he said: [...] "It was my small act of rebellion. I never liked it [...] When I finally <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> she said, 'Nor do I'. So I decided to be George after my grandfather, who was a war hero. Life was easier as a George; it was a straightforward name." [...] He is the eldest of four boys. His father Sir Peter Osborne co-founded the firm of fabric and wallpaper designers Osborne & Little. His mother is Felicity Alexandra Loxton-Peacock, the daughter of Hungarian-born artist Clarisse Loxton-Peacock (née Fehér).|$|E

60|$|On Beltane Eve, and our Lowchester rummage being finished, I {{went along}} the valley {{to the far}} end of Swathinglea to help sort the stock of the {{detached}} group of potbanks there--their chief output had been mantel ornaments in imitation of marble, and there was very little sorting, I found, to be done--and there it was nurse Anna found me at last by telephone, and <b>told</b> me <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had died in the morning suddenly and very shortly after my departure.|$|R
5000|$|Joan {{was asked}} {{concerning}} a dream which {{her father had}} prior to her leaving Domremy. She replied that she was [...] "often <b>told</b> by <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> that <b>my</b> father spoke of having dreamed that I would go off with men-at-arms" [...] {{and that she had}} heard her mother tell how [...] "my father said to my brothers 'in truth, if I thought this thing would happen which I have dreamed about my daughter, I would want you to drown her; and if you would not, I would drown her myself'." [...] (He evidently mistakenly assumed she would become a prostitute accompanying an army).|$|R
6000|$|At {{night or}} on Sunday I {{continued}} my conferences with father and mother. Together {{we went over}} the past, talking of old neighbors and from one of these conversations came the theme of my first story. It was a very simple tale (<b>told</b> by <b>my</b> <b>mother)</b> of an old woman, who made a trip back to her York state home after an absence in the West of nearly thirty years. I was able to remember {{some of the details}} of her experience and when <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had finished speaking I said to her, [...] "That is too good to lose. I'm going to write it out." [...] Then to amuse her, I added, [...] "Why, that's worth seventy-five dollars to me. I'll go halves with you." ...|$|R

"That little letter came to me; I never <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> but {{answered}} it, {{and kept}} silent till news arrived {{that the ship}} in which Letty had taken passage was lost. Remorse had been tugging at my heart; and, when I {{knew that she was}} dead, I forgave her with a vain forgiveness, and mourned for my darling, as if she had never left me. I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> then, and she did not utter one reproach; but age seemed to fall upon her all at once, and the pathetic quietude you see.|$|E
60|$|After this I {{went home}} and <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> all my joy, for in truth there was no happier man in Egypt. She listened, then answered, smiling a little.|$|E

6000|$|... "Monsieur Museau and I {{managed to}} be pretty good friends. If I could be exchanged, or sent home, I <b>told</b> him that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> would pay liberally for my ransom; and I suppose this idea excited the cupidity of the commandant, for a trapper coming in the winter, whilst I still lay very ill with fever, Museau consented that I should write home to <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> but that the letter should be in French, that he should see it, and that I should say I was {{in the hands of}} the Indians, and should not be ransomed under ten {{thousand}} livres.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Jess, darling," [...] he answered. [...] "They're worthless, I know; {{but they}} have for me a certain sentimental value, as I've often <b>told</b> you. <b>My</b> dear <b>mother</b> wore them, while she lived, as ear-rings; {{and as soon as}} she died I had them set as links in order that I might always keep them about me. Besides, they have {{historical}} and family interest. Even a worthless heirloom, after all, is an heirloom." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My sister will in {{one respect}} at least {{anticipate}} {{the assistance of the}} jeweler," [...] he said. [...] "She proposes to bring with her, as a present to the bride, an heirloom on the female side of our family. It is a pearl necklace (of very great value, I am <b>told)</b> presented to <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> by the Empress Maria Theresa--in recognition of services rendered to that illustrious person early in life. As an expression of my sister's interest in the marriage, I thought an announcement of the proposed gift might prove gratifying to you." ...|$|R

'I {{met some}} {{one in the}} village who lives in my country, and he <b>told</b> me that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> is very, very ill, and if I {{do not go to}} her at once she will be dead before I arrive. I will return as soon as I can, and now farewell.' And she set forth in the {{direction}} of the mountains. But this story was not true; she knew nothing about her mother, only she wanted an excuse to go home and tell her family that their prophecies had come true, and that the buffalo was dead.|$|R
60|$|It is easy {{to believe}} that I was strangely {{affected}} with this story, but 'tis impossible to describe the nature of my disturbance. I seemed astonished at the story, and asked her a thousand questions about the particulars, which I found she was thoroughly acquainted with. At last I began to inquire into {{the circumstances of the}} family, how the old gentlewoman, I mean <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> died, and how she left what she had; for <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had promised me very solemnly, that when she died she would do something for me, and leave it so, as that, if I was living, I should one way or other come at it, without its being in the power of her son, my brother and husband, to prevent it. She told me she did not know exactly how it was ordered, but she had been <b>told</b> that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had left a sum of money, and had tied her plantation for the payment of it, to be made good to the daughter, if ever she could be heard of, either in England or elsewhere; and that the trust was left with this son, who was the person that we saw with his father.|$|R
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> that I {{had done}} nothing, {{absolutely}} nothing, but {{attend to the}} wants of my son's people, just as I {{had been used to}} see my grandmother, and my aunt Thistlewood, or any English lady, do at home.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyzed}} the narrative devices women use when telling difficult or sad stories in familial settings. I documented a story <b>told</b> by <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> Myrle Hoagland, {{about the death}} of her twin brother at age 17. I provided a textual analysis concentrating on the storyteller’s use of silence, additional information, and non-linear structure, to provide meaning and instruction to her family. I also contextually {{analyzed the}} story, illuminating the unique way informal learning affected the storyteller’s performance. My analysis demonstrated how I, as an emic ethnographer, documented a familiar story about a death in my family. Upon deeper study, the storyteller attempted to instruct both consciously and subconsciously on topics about sexuality, economics, motherhood, and identity. This thesis is a case study of how women in my family use narrative devices such as silence, overlays, and performative variations to both project and withhold meaning...|$|R

6000|$|Evidently, she {{saw nothing}} {{especially}} significant in my request, {{but to me}} it was a subtle stratagem. To have her take part in my bargain-hunting was almost as exciting as though we were furnishing OUR home, but I dared not assume that she was thinking along these dangerous lines. That she was genuinely interested in my household problems was evident, but I was not justified in asking anything further. She was distinctly closer to me that day, more tenderly intimate than she had ever been before, and her womanly understanding of my task--the deep sympathy she expressed when I <b>told</b> her of <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> recent illness--all combined to give me comfort--and hope! ...|$|R
60|$|Morning {{and evening}} {{appeared}} my father's great {{face in the}} doorway, his eyebrows lifted high above his spectacles.

When Dr Grose gave him permission, he sat down beside my bed and stooping low, <b>told</b> me that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had remembered our last speech together on the staircase, {{and he gave me}} her last message. A thousand and one remembrances of her patience and impulsiveness, of our long hours of solitude together, of her fits of new life {{as if she were a}} tree blossoming in the Spring, of her voice, her dignified silence with Miss Fenne, her sallies with my grandfather, her absent musings--these all return to me.|$|R
