When the steering clutch is engaged, the shaft spins one of the <b>idler</b> <b>sets</b> forward and the other backward, causing one track to speed up {{and the other to}} slow down.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} the full theory of a synchronously pumped type I optical parametric oscillator (SPOPO). We derive expressions for the oscillation threshold and {{the characteristics of the}} generated mode-locked signal beam. We calculate the output quantum fluctuations of the device, and find that, in the degenerate case (coincident signal and <b>idler</b> <b>set</b> of frequencies), perfect squeezing is obtained when one approaches threshold from below for a well defined "super-mode', or frequency comb, consisting of a coherent linear superposition of signal modes of different frequencies which are resonant in the cavity...|$|R
25|$|The Maybach {{system is}} {{essentially}} a simplified version of the double differential, or more accurately in mechanical terms, a double controlled differential. It replaces the double differential's forward and reverse steering shaft and clutch system with a single shaft that spins in one direction, and brakes on the idlers. Like the controlled differential, the brakes are normally applied to keep the idlers fixed. The steering inputs release {{one or the other}} brake to cause the idler to spin and that track to slow. Unlike the full double differential, the other side is not sped up so the system is not fully regenerative, and since both <b>idler</b> <b>sets</b> spin in the same direction, it does not offer neutral steering.|$|R

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The power {{consumption}} of an overland conveying system can by predicted using {{a range of}} analytical and experimental methods. The main component of energy loss in an overland conveying system {{is due to the}} deformation of the bottom cover of the belt as it moves over each <b>idler</b> <b>set.</b> This loss is commonly labelled indentation rolling resistance. There are a number of existing analytical models which approximate the indentation rolling resistance of a belt conveying system. The accuracy of analytical models depends on the method of testing of a conveyor belts’ viscoelastic material properties. Due to the limitations and inconsistency of obtaining material properties using mechanical methods, it is becoming more common for viscoelastic behaviour to be represented by non-mechanical models, such as dielectric models. Electrical methods can lead to the same mathematical predictions as mechanical models, however, electric circuit experimental work is highly accurate and can be performed over a much greater frequency range than dynamic mechanical testing. This thesis examines mechanical methods of measuring the viscoelastic material properties of the bottom cover of a conveyor belt. The mechanical properties measured are used to evaluate the accuracy of a variety of mechanical analytical models. This thesis also examines various electrical methods of measuring the dielectric relaxation properties of the bottom cover of a conveyor belt. The mechanically measured viscoelastic properties are compared to the dielectric relaxation properties using well-establish mechanical and dielectric analogies. Dielectric indentation rolling resistance prediction models are developed by the author that can be used as analogies to the existing mechanical indentation rolling resistance models. The predictions from the mechanical and author developed dielectric rolling resistance models are compared to actual indentation rolling resistance data obtained from tests performed at the University of Newcastle on a purpose built test facility for the same rubber compounds for verification...|$|R
40|$|Mining {{and mineral}} {{processing}} industries {{throughout the world}} rely on the efficient transportation of bulk solid. Belt conveyors {{have been used for}} the transportation of bulk solid over relatively short distances for many years, but with significant developments in analytical procedures to describe the dynamic properties of belt conveying systems, the utilisation of belt conveyors for long distance overiand transportation is becoming more economically viable. Belt conveyor installations are becoming progressively longer and belt speeds significantly faster, and as these trends continue it becomes increasingly important that the motion resistances associated with the operation of belt conveyors be minimised for optimum performance and efficiency. In the energy conscious world in which we live, no longer is it acceptable for a belt conveyor to simply transport bulk solid from one point to another, the operation must be economically viable, environmentally friendly and energy efficient. The energy consumed in raising bulk solid from one level to another is typically a parameter that cannot be easily changed, and is usually determined by plant constraints or the terrain over which the conveyor is travelling. As a result the primary area of focus in order to minimise power consumption is the resistances associated with the motion of the belt conveyor. The energy consumed during the operation of a long horizontal belt conveyor is primarily due to the frictional resistance that occurs {{along the length of the}} conveyor. This resistance is known as the main resistance and includes the belt and bulk solid flexure resistance, the rotating resistance of the idler rolls and the indentation rolling resistance of the conveyor belt. This paper will discuss each component of the main resistance and provide details of methods to calculate the contribution of each component. A finite difference solution that applies orthotropic plate mechanics is described to calculate the deflection of the conveyor belt due to the loading induced from the weight of the belt and bulk solid, and the loading induced from the relative movement of the bulk solid. Given the displacement of the belt and bulk solid the flexure resistance of each component can then be calculated. The rotating resistance of the idler rolls is briefly discussed and an apparatus to measure the resistance is presented. A finite element model is then discussed which calculates the indentation rolling resistance occurring at each <b>idler</b> <b>set</b> from the viscoelastic properties of the bottom cover of the conveyor belt...|$|R
5000|$|When Becker and Fagen {{expressed}} frustration {{during the}} band's second album Countdown to Ecstasy with {{the difficulty in}} acquiring a steady drum tempo, Nichols was forced to improvise. The track Show Biz Kids had proved especially challenging in regards to a steady beat. As quoted in Brian Sweet's biography of Steely Dan, Reelin' in the Years, Nichols recalled:"It {{was just one of}} those tunes that that was so very difficult to play exactly in tempo, with every instrument in sync. ... There were no drum machines in those days, so we made a 24 track, eight bar tape loop, which at 30 ips was a considerable length of tape, trailed it out through the door into the studio, around a little <b>idler</b> which was <b>set</b> up on a camera tripod, back into the studio and then copied that to a second 24 track machine. Everything was on tape except the lead vocal and the lead guitar. It worked like a dream." ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIdlers {{rotational}} resistance has {{a significant}} impact on energy consumption of belt conveyors. The conducted analyses showed that this component can account for 30 % of total belt conveyor resistance to motion (Gładysiewicz and Kawalec, 2008; Błażej et al., 2013). The causes for idlers rotational resistance including structural factors were precisely determined in (Gładysiewicz and Król, 2005). Since then, many works have been carried out with the aim to assess the quality of idlers and to acquire the knowledge necessary to optimize belt conveyor haulage process (Bukowski et al., 2011 a, Gładysiewicz and Król, 2009; 2012). It was due to, inter alia, the fact that the calculations of belt conveyors designs are based only on empirical relationships which give a good approximation for laboratory tested idlers, but are imprecise in relation to new construction solutions of idlers. The results of research and development works carried out at the Wroclaw University of Technology have shown that one of the conditions for successful reduction of the energy consumption of belt conveyors drives is to use high-quality idlers characterized by low rotational resistance under a wide range of working loads (Bukowski et al., 2011 c, Król and Kisielewski 2014). The studies allowed expanding knowledge about idlers rotational resistance and about the impact of working loads on belt conveyors resistance to motion and showed that idlers rotational resistance depends also on value of the idlers radial loads caused by transported masses. A series of laboratory and operational tests based on using advanced analytical tools and modern measuring techniques have been carried out and allowed to observe dependence between instantaneous mass output of belt conveyor and loads of individual <b>idlers</b> in the <b>set.</b> This allowed determining the dependence of idlers rotational resistance as a function of random loading of transported bulk material (Bukowski 2012, Król 2013) ...|$|R
