5|$|Abnormalities in the ARH gene, {{also known}} as LDLRAP1, were first {{reported}} in a family in 1973. In contrast to the other causes, two abnormal copies of the gene are required for FH to develop (autosomal recessive). The mutations in the protein tend to cause {{the production of a}} shortened protein. Its real function is unclear, but it seems {{to play a role in}} the relation between the LDL receptor and clathrin-coated pits. People with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> severe disease than LDLR-heterozygotes but less severe than LDLR-homozygotes.|$|E
5|$|Visual {{differentiation}} {{from the}} fish crow (C. ossifragus) {{is extremely difficult}} and often inaccurate. Nonetheless, differences apart from size do exist. Fish crows <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> slender bills and feet. There {{may also be a}} small sharp hook {{at the end of the}} upper bill. Fish crows also appear as if they have shorter legs when walking. More dramatically, when calling, fish crows tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathers.|$|E
5|$|Details of {{the fruit}} bodies' appearance, color in particular, are {{somewhat}} variable and dependent on growing conditions. For example, specimens growing on logs in oak and hickory forests in the spring <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> yellowish-white, depressed caps than {{those found in the}} same location in autumn, which are light yellow brown and more convex in shape. The fruit body development of M.rotula is hemiangiocarpous, with an hymenium that is only partially enclosed by basidiocarp tissues. Robert Kühner showed that a -like tissue covers the young gills before the expanding cap breaks away from the stem. In unfavorable weather conditions, however, the mushrooms may fail to develop normally and instead produce semi-gasteroid basidiocarps.|$|E

5|$|Mutation {{analysis}} of the ATP7B gene, {{as well as other}} genes linked to copper accumulation in the liver, may be performed. Once a mutation is confirmed, it is possible to screen family members for the disease as part of clinical genetics family counseling. Regional distributions of genes associated with Wilson's disease are important to follow, as this can help clinicians design appropriate screening strategies. Since mutations of the WD gene vary between populations, research and genetic testing done in countries like the USA or United Kingdom can pose problems as they <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> mixed populations.|$|E
5|$|Males {{establish}} their dominance more forcefully than females. A male disperses, or leaves his natal group and joins another group, after reaching sexual maturity. Adult males are very competitive {{with each other}} and fight for access to females. Higher dominance means better access to mating and earlier access to food, so naturally a great deal of fighting over rank occurs, with younger males constantly trying to rise in position. Because females stay with their groups their entire lives, and males emigrate to others, often a new male challenges an older one for dominance. Frequently, when older baboons drop in the social hierarchy, they move to another tribe. The younger males who pushed them down often bullies and harasses them. Older males <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> supportive and equal relationships than those of the younger males. The former may form coalitions against the latter.|$|E
5|$|The {{color and}} texture of the coyote's fur varies {{somewhat}} geographically. The hair's predominant color is light gray and red or fulvous, interspersed around the body with black and white. Coyotes living at high elevations <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> black and gray shades than their desert-dwelling counterparts, which are more fulvous or whitish-gray. The coyote's fur consists of short, soft underfur and long, coarse guard hairs. The fur of northern subspecies is longer and denser than in southern forms, with the fur of some Mexican and Central American forms being almost hispid (bristly). Generally, adult coyotes (including coywolf hybrids) have a sable coat color, dark neonatal coat color, bushy tail with an active supracaudal gland, and a white facial mask. Albinism is extremely rare in coyotes; {{out of a total}} of 750,000 coyotes harvested by federal and cooperative hunters between March22, 1938, and June30, 1945, only two were albinos.|$|E

5|$|Breeding {{takes place}} over the warmer months with eggs laid from August to January. The clutch is laid {{on a bed of}} wood dust or leaves and {{consists}} of two to five (or rarely up to eight) round or oval glossy white eggs, each of which is generally 21 to 22mm long by 18mm (0.8 by 0.7in) wide. Clutches <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> eggs in earlier rather than later clutches, and in nests located further from cleared land. Eggs are laid at an interval of two to three days. Incubation takes 18 to 21 days. The female incubates the eggs and broods the young, and feeds them for their first few days before the male begins helping. She leaves to feed and drink twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Both parents take part in feeding the young, on a diet predominantly of seeds with some fruit. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, they are born helpless and blind and remain in the nest for an extended period. Covered in silvery-white down, they have pink skin and darker blue-grey skin around the eye. By seven days they open their eyes, and are well-covered in grey down with pin feathers emerging from their wings on day six. They are almost covered in feathers by day 21, and fledge (leave the nest) at around 23days of age in the wild and up to 30days of age in captivity.|$|E
5|$|From left {{to right}} across the {{standard}} form of periodic table, as metallic character decreases, nonmetals therefore adopt structures that show a gradual reduction {{in the numbers of}} nearest neighbours—three or two for the polyatomic nonmetals, through one for the diatomic nonmetals, to zero for the monatomic noble gases. A similar pattern occurs more generally, {{at the level of the}} entire periodic table, in comparing metals and nonmetals. There is a transition from metallic bonding among the metals on the left of the table through to covalent or Van der Waals (electrostatic) bonding among the nonmetals on the right of the table. Metallic bonding tends to involve close-packed centrosymmetric structures with a high number of nearest neighbours. Post-transition metals and metalloids, sandwiched between the true metals and the nonmetals, <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> complex structures with an intermediate number of nearest neighbours. Nonmetallic bonding, towards the right of the table, features open-packed directional (or disordered) structures with fewer or zero nearest neighbours. As noted, this steady reduction in the number of nearest neighbours, as metallic character decreases and nonmetallic character increases, is mirrored among the nonmetals, the structures of which gradually change from polyatomic, to diatomic, to monatomic.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Wallace {{wrote the}} book Darwinism, which {{explained}} and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might {{contribute to the development}} of new species. He suggested the following scenario. When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted than either parent form and, at that point, natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species. This idea came to be known as the Wallace effect, later referred to as reinforcement. Wallace had suggested to Darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridisation in private correspondence as early as 1868, but had not worked it out to this level of detail. It continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today, with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity.|$|E
