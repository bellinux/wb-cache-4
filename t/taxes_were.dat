5|$|Lands {{that were}} exempt from <b>taxes</b> <b>were</b> called manya and {{sometimes}} consisted of several villages. They were granted by local chieftains without {{any reference to}} the overlord, indicating a de-centralised economy. These lands, often given to heroes who perished {{in the line of}} duty were called bilavritti or kalnad. When such a grant was made for the maintenance of temples at the time of consecration, it was called Talavritti. Some types of taxes on income were kara or anthakara (internal taxes), utkota (gifts due to the king), hiranya (cash payments) and sulika (tolls and duties on imported items). <b>Taxes</b> <b>were</b> collected from those who held the right to cultivate land; even if the land was not actually cultivated.|$|E

5|$|Al Dawasir {{attacked}} Shia {{villages of}} Barbar and A'ali, while the Khalids attacked Sitra island. The attacks {{resulted in the}} killing of 12 villagers, burning of several houses and raping of women. The violence settled after Colonel Knox, the British acting Political Resident arrived in Bahrain in two gunships. Knox forced Isa bin Ali to abdicate in favor of his elder son, Hamad. The Khalids had agreed to reduce taxes on residents of Sitra following the visit. However, as soon as Knox left, <b>taxes</b> <b>were</b> increased again, and Shia residents continued to be subjected to forced labor. The situation prompted some 500 Shia to hold a protest in front of the British Agency demanding a solution to the situation and equal taxation of citizens (<b>taxes</b> <b>were</b> only imposed on the Shia).|$|E
5|$|Diocletian's edicts {{emphasized}} the common liability of all taxpayers. Public records of all <b>taxes</b> <b>were</b> made public. The position of decurion, {{member of the}} city council, had been an honor sought by wealthy aristocrats and the middle classes who displayed their wealth by paying for city amenities and public works. Decurions were made liable for any shortfall {{in the amount of}} tax collected. Many tried to find ways to escape the obligation.|$|E
5|$|The Flavians {{initiated}} {{economic and}} cultural reforms. Under Vespasian, new <b>taxes</b> <b>were</b> devised to restore the Empire's finances, while Domitian revalued the Roman coinage by increasing its silver content.

50|$|The royalty <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> an {{indirect}} <b>tax,</b> and has <b>been</b> historically {{the most important}} mineral tax. When the production starts, the <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> due. That generates up-front revenues for the government. A different approach of the royalty <b>tax</b> <b>is,</b> to impose it as a factor payment for extraction of minerals. If royalty <b>taxes</b> <b>are</b> very high, it might influence the production, because it gets too expensive for the firms to produce and extract minerals.|$|R

5|$|The king {{determined}} the tax levels based on need and circumstances {{in the kingdom}} while ensuring that an undue burden was not placed on the peasants. The land owner or tenant paid a variety of taxes, including land taxes, produce taxes and payment of the overhead for maintenance of the Gavunda (village head). Land <b>taxes</b> <b>were</b> varied, based on type of land, its produce and situation and ranged from 8% to 16%. A Banavasi inscription of 941 mentions reassessment of land tax due to the drying up of an old irrigation canal in the region. The land tax may have been as high as 20% to pay for expenses of a military frequently at war. In most of the kingdom, land <b>taxes</b> <b>were</b> paid in goods and services and rarely was cash accepted. A portion of all taxes earned by the government (usually 15%) was returned to the villages for maintenance.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a massive}} {{expansion}} of ploughland during the Song dynasty. The government encouraged people to reclaim barren lands and put them under cultivation.

50|$|The {{property}} <b>tax</b> most citizens <b>are</b> {{aware of}} {{is known as}} an ad valorem <b>tax.</b> This <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> used to fund general or day-to-day government operations. An ad valorem <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> commonly levied on both real and personal property. A property <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> based upon a property's market value. The ad valorem <b>tax</b> levy <b>is</b> based upon a millage rate which never varies from parcel to parcel. The foundation principles for ad valorem <b>taxes</b> <b>are</b> that each property is valued according to its market value (equity) and that each property <b>is</b> <b>taxed</b> based upon a single millage rate that applies to everyone (uniformity).|$|R

5|$|A {{combination}} of favorable geographical features {{contributed to the}} success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. Land management was crucial in ancient Egypt because <b>taxes</b> <b>were</b> assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.|$|E
5|$|After the Danish Reformation, {{involving}} {{the suppression of}} the Catholic bishopric in 1536, the city enjoyed a sustained period of prosperity from the 1530s to the mid-17th century, becoming northern Funen's commercial centre. One of the main sources of income was the sale of cattle, providing substantial funds for the construction of fine half-timbered houses for the local merchants. The local nobility also participated in the city's development by building residences where they spent the winter months. But the city's prosperity came to an abrupt end in the late 1650s heavy <b>taxes</b> <b>were</b> imposed {{after the end of the}} Swedish Wars. A period of stagnation ensued until the end of the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Andronicus' {{rule was}} marked by {{incompetence}} and short-sighted decisions {{that in the long}} run would damage the Byzantine Empire beyond repair. He began to debase the Byzantine hyperpyron, resulting in a reduction of the value of the Byzantine economy; <b>taxes</b> <b>were</b> decreased for the Powerful, i.e. landed aristocracy and instead placed upon the Knight-class Pronoia. To popularize his rule he repudiated the union of the Orthodox and Catholic Churches decreed by the Second Council of Lyon in 1274, thereby further increasing hostilities between the Latins and the Byzantines.|$|E

50|$|A fuel tax (also {{known as}} a petrol, {{gasoline}} or gas tax, or as a fuel duty) <b>is</b> an excise <b>tax</b> imposed {{on the sale of}} fuel. In most countries the fuel <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> imposed on fuels which are intended for transportation. Fuels used to power agricultural vehicles, and/or home heating oil which is similar to diesel <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> at a different, usually lower rate. The fuel <b>tax</b> receipts <b>are</b> often dedicated or hypothecated to transportation projects so that the fuel <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> considered by many a user fee. In other countries, the fuel <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> a source of general revenue. Sometimes, the fuel <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> used as an ecotax, to promote ecological sustainability. Fuel <b>taxes</b> <b>are</b> often considered regressive taxes.|$|R
5|$|Aside {{from the}} landowner's land tax paid in {{a portion of}} their crop yield, the poll tax and {{property}} <b>taxes</b> <b>were</b> paid in coin cash. The annual poll tax rate for adult men and women was 120 coins and 20 coins for minors. Merchants were required to pay a higher rate of 240 coins. The poll tax stimulated a money economy that necessitated the minting of over 28,000,000,000 coins from 118 BC to 5 AD, an average of 220,000,000 coins a year.|$|E
5|$|At the Diet of March 1467, two {{traditional}} <b>taxes</b> <b>were</b> renamed; the chamber's profit was thereafter collected as tax of {{the royal}} treasury and the thirtieth as the Crown's customs. Because of this change, all previous tax exemptions became void, increasing state revenues. Matthias set about centralizing the administration of royal revenues. He entrusted {{the administration of the}} Crown's customs to John Ernuszt, a converted Jewish merchant. Within two years, Ernuszt was responsible for the collection of all ordinary and extraordinary taxes, and the management of the salt mines.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, Indiana, {{like the}} rest of the nation, was {{affected}} by the Great Depression. The economic downturn had a wide-ranging negative impact on Indiana. Urbanization declined. Governor Paul V. McNutt's administration struggled to build from scratch a state-funded welfare system to help the overwhelmed private charities. During his administration, spending and <b>taxes</b> <b>were</b> cut drastically in response to the Depression. The state government was completely reorganized. McNutt also enacted the state's first income tax. On several occasions, he declared martial law to put an end to worker strikes.|$|E

5|$|During the General Assembly's 2005 session, Fletcher again {{proposed}} his {{tax reform}} plan, and {{late in the}} session, both houses passed it. The plan raised sin taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, as well as upping taxes on satellite television service and motel rooms. Businesses were also subjected to a gross receipts tax. In exchange, corporate <b>taxes</b> <b>were</b> lowered, as were income taxes for individuals who earned less than $75,000 annually; 300,000 low-wage earners were dropped from the income tax rolls altogether.

5|$|Early Dutch missionaries faced strong {{opposition}} among Torajans, {{especially among the}} elite, because the abolition of their profitable slave trade had angered them.

Ultimately, the Dutch influence did not subdue Torajan culture, and only a few Torajans were converted. In 1950, only 10% of the population had converted to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|On taking power Henry gave a high {{priority}} to the restoration of royal finances in England, reviving Henry I's financial processes and attempting {{to improve the quality}} of the royal accounting. Revenue from the demesne formed the bulk of Henry's income in England, although <b>taxes</b> <b>were</b> used heavily in the first 11 years of his reign. Aided by the capable Richard FitzNeal, Henry reformed the currency in 1158, putting his name on English coins for the first time and heavily reducing the number of moneyers licensed to produce coins. These measures were successful in improving his income, but on his return to England in the 1160s Henry took further steps. New <b>taxes</b> <b>were</b> introduced and the existing accounts re-audited, and the reforms of the legal system brought in new streams of money from fines and amercements. A wholesale reform of the coinage occurred in 1180, with royal officials taking direct control of the mints and passing the profits directly to the treasury. A new penny, called the Short Cross, was introduced, and the number of mints reduced substantially to ten across the country. Driven by the reforms, the royal revenues increased significantly; during the first part of the reign, Henry's average exchequer income was only around £18,000; after 1166, the average was around £22,000. One economic effect of these changes was a substantial increase in the amount of money in circulation in England and, post-1180, a significant, long-term increase in both inflation and trade.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1500s, the leidang <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> {{supplemented}} by additional taxes imposed {{when the government}} needed extra revenue, as in wartimes. From 1600 the additional <b>taxes</b> <b>was</b> imposed more frequently and around 1620 the tax became annual. The leilending (tenant farmer) <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> a property <b>tax</b> where farms <b>were</b> divided into three groups {{depending on the size}} of the farms (full farms, half farms, and deserted farms). The <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> from the 1640s dependent on the land rent. In 1665, Norway got its first land register (...) with a land rent that reflected the value of the production of the farm. The leilending <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> therefore a <b>tax</b> on the expected returns in agriculture.|$|R
5000|$|Typically the {{withholding}} <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> {{treated as}} a payment {{on account of the}} recipient's final tax liability, when the withholding is made in advance.
