5|$|Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir (Out of {{the depths}} I call, Lord, to You), , is a church cantata by the German {{composer}} Johann Sebastian Bach. It was composed in either 1707 or 1708, {{which makes it}} one of Bach's earliest cantatas. Some sources suggest {{that it could be}} his earliest surviving work in this form, but current <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> that there are one or two earlier examples.|$|E
5|$|According to Kohlberg, someone {{progressing}} to {{a higher}} stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing {{the limitations of the}} current stage of <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.|$|E
5|$|The enzymes trypsin and {{chymotrypsin}} {{were first}} purified in the 1930s. A serine {{in each of}} trypsin and chymotrypsin was identified as the catalytic nucleophile (by diisopropyl fluorophosphate modification) in the 1950s. The structure of chymotrypsin was solved by X-ray crystallography in the 1960s, showing {{the orientation of the}} catalytic triad in the active site. Other proteases were sequenced and aligned to reveal a family of related proteases, now called the S1 family. Simultaneously, the structures of the evolutionarily unrelated papain and subtilisin proteases were found to contain analogous triads. The 'charge-relay' mechanism for the activation of the nucleophile by the other triad members was proposed in the late 1960s. As more protease structures were solved by X-ray crystallography in the 1970s and 80s, homologous (such as TEV protease) and analogous (such as papain) triads were found. The MEROPS classification system in the 1990s and 2000s began classing proteases into structurally related enzyme superfamilies and so acts as a database of the convergent evolution of triads in over 20 superfamilies. Understanding how chemical constraints on evolution led to the convergence of so many enzyme families on the same triad geometries has developed in the 2010s. Of particular contention during the 1990s and early 2000s was the contribution of low-barrier hydrogen bonding to catalysis; however, current <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> that ordinary hydrogen bonding is sufficient to explain the mechanism. The massive body of work on the charge-relay, covalent catalysis used by catalytic triads has led to the mechanism being the best characterised in all of biochemistry.|$|E

25|$|Convergent <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> also {{linked to}} {{knowledge}} as it involves manipulating existing knowledge {{by means of}} standard procedures. Knowledge is another important aspect of creativity. It {{is a source of}} ideas, suggests pathways to solutions, and provides criteria of effectiveness and novelty. Convergent <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> used as a tool in creative problem solving. When an individual is using critical thinking to solve a problem they consciously use standards or probabilities to make judgments. This contrasts with divergent thinking where judgment is deferred while looking for and accepting many possible solutions.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to reveal {{correlation}} between motivation and creative professional thinking. Four hundred and seventy-one Russians of different trades participated in the study. It was supposed that motivational structure and level of creative professional <b>thinking</b> <b>were</b> interrelated. The connection between motivational components and professional <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> revealed. Tendencies of transition form situational level of thinking to oversituational one were determined. It was found out that motivational structure of workers with situational <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> much more consistent than that of workers with oversituational thinking...|$|R

25|$|HR characterizes {{feelings}} and emotions {{as indicators of}} the quality of one's thinking. Within the HR model, unpleasant feelings or emotions, or stressful feelings, indicate that one's <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> based on insecurity, negative beliefs, conditioning or learned patterns that are not necessarily appropriate to the live moment here and now. They simultaneously indicate that the individual has temporarily lost sight of what HR asserts is his or her own role in creating experience. Pleasant or desired feelings (such as a sense of well-being, gratitude, compassion, peace, etc.) indicate, within the HR model, that the quality of one's <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> exactly as it needs to be.|$|E

25|$|J. P. Guilford drew a {{distinction}} between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed convergent and divergent thinking). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem.

Other researchers have occasionally used the terms flexible thinking or fluid intelligence, which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.|$|E
