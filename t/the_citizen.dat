5|$|Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Citizen</b> Forces {{deteriorated}} {{during the}} war as the AIF was given precedence for manpower and other resources. While {{the size of the}} force increased during 1915, a high proportion volunteered for overseas service with the AIF. Many officers were used to train AIF recruits, and camp facilities and equipment were also assigned to the expeditionary force. This greatly disrupted <b>the</b> <b>Citizen</b> Forces training activities, with few units conducting camps during late 1915 or 1916. While there were intakes of conscripts to <b>the</b> <b>Citizen</b> Forces during 1916 and 1917, few were ever required to undertake periods of training or active service. In October 1916 approximately 37,000 reservists were called up {{for a short period of}} compulsory training ahead of the first plebiscite on conscription. By 1918 <b>the</b> <b>Citizen</b> Forces were close to collapse as many of its best members had transferred to the AIF and the remaining personnel were largely untrained. Attempts were made to revive <b>the</b> <b>Citizen</b> Forces during the last months of the war. The initially successful German Spring Offensive, which began in March, led to concerns Japan could attack Australia. In response, regular training camps for militia units were reinstated. A scheme to set up a reserve force manned by returned AIF veterans attracted 17,000 volunteers, yet they received no training.|$|E

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{covers the}} topic of Hepatitis type B. The goal of the thesis was {{to find out the}} public knowledge about this illness {{and at the same time}} also to find out whether <b>the</b> <b>citizens</b> use their own personal hygiene products and protective means. The results of the research say that <b>the</b> <b>citizens</b> outside <b>the</b> health industry older 15 years of age in České Budějovice and Pelhřimov do not have the knowledge on the ways of transfer and protection for the Hepatitis type B, but they know the health risks. During the research investigation, we also have found out that <b>the</b> <b>citizens</b> do not use their own personal hygiene products, and that <b>the</b> <b>citizens</b> of České Budějovice use the protective means more often than <b>the</b> <b>citizens</b> of Pelhřimov. Hepatitis type B is a serious and complicated illness, which daily threatens all <b>the</b> <b>citizens.</b> With respect to the results of the research, it is important that <b>the</b> <b>citizens</b> get more information on Hepatitis type B, especially on the vaccination possibility, about using only ones own personal hygiene products and using preservatives and rubber medical gloves in risk situations. <b>The</b> <b>citizens</b> could acquire <b>the</b> information from this bachelor thesis or from the seminars lead by general nurses...|$|R

5|$|Initially, the {{manpower}} of <b>the</b> <b>Citizen</b> Forces was maintained through {{a mixture of}} voluntary and compulsory service, but in 1929–30, the compulsory training scheme was abolished by the newly elected Scullin Labor government and <b>the</b> <b>Citizen</b> Forces replaced by the all-volunteer Militia. The economic hardships of the period resulted in few volunteers, and by December 1929 the 49th Battalion's strength had fallen to just 108 men of all ranks. As a result, in early 1930 the 49th Battalion merged with the Toowoomba-based 25th to form the 25th/49th Battalion. In October 1934, amidst a wide-scale reorganisation of the Militia, the two battalions were delinked and the 49th was amalgamated with the 9th Battalion. They remained linked until July 1940, when the 49th Battalion was reformed {{in its own right}} as Australia mobilised for the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|Russell replaces Mill's {{analysis}} with {{an examination of}} the issue from four perspectives: the perspective of the governor, <b>the</b> <b>citizen,</b> the innovator, and the philosopher. The rational governor is always threatened by revolutionary activities, and can always be expected to ban speech which calls for assassination. Yet the governor would be advised to allow freedom of speech to prevent and diminish discontent among the subjects, and has no reason to suppress ideas which are unrelated to his governance, for instance the Copernican doctrine of heliocentrism. Relatedly, <b>the</b> <b>citizen</b> mainly understands free speech {{as an extension of the}} right to do peaceably that which could only otherwise be done through violence (Russell 1938:179–182).|$|E
5|$|The {{demobilisation}} of the Australian military {{following the}} end of the Second World War was completed in 1947. Plans for post-war defence arrangements were predicated on maintaining a relatively strong peacetime force. It was envisioned that the Royal Australian Navy maintaining a fleet that would include two light fleet carriers, two cruisers, six destroyers, 16 others ships in commission and another 52 in reserved. The Royal Australian Air Force would have a strength of 16 squadrons, including four manned by <b>the</b> <b>Citizen</b> Air Force. Meanwhile, in a significant departure from past Australian defence policy which had previously relied on citizen forces, the Australian Army would include a permanent field force of 19,000 regulars organised into a brigade of three infantry battalions with armoured support, serving alongside a part-time force of 50,000 men in <b>the</b> <b>Citizen</b> Military Forces. The Australian Regular Army was subsequently formed on 30 September 1947, while the CMF was re-raised on 1 July 1948.|$|E

5|$|With the ephors vanquished, Cleomenes {{initiated}} his reforms. First, {{he handed}} over his {{land to the}} state; he was soon followed by his stepfather and his friends, {{and then by the}} rest of the citizens. He divided up all of the Spartan land, awarding an equal lot to each citizen. He increased <b>the</b> <b>citizen</b> population by granting citizenship to some perioeci, who constituted the Spartan middle class, but did not at that time have Spartan citizenship. Expanding <b>the</b> <b>citizen</b> population meant that Cleomenes could build a larger army; he trained 4,000 hoplites and restored the old Spartan social and military discipline. He also strengthened his army by introducing the Macedonian sarissa (pike). Cleomenes completed his reforms by placing his brother, Eucleidas, in charge, making him the first Agiad king on the Eurypontid throne.|$|E
5|$|As {{the author}} of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of <b>the</b> <b>Citizen,</b> written in 1789, Lafayette was a staunch {{opponent}} to the concept of slavery. His writing was adopted as part of the French Constitution and included revolutionary ideas such as the freedom and equality of all men. His work never specifically mentioned slavery; however, he made clear his position on the controversial topic through letters addressed to friends and colleagues, such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Lafayette proposed that slaves not be owned but rather work as free tenants on the land of plantation owners. In 1785, Lafayette bought a plantation in the French colony of Cayenne to begin putting his experimental ideas into practice. He ordered that none of his slaves be bought or sold. He spent his lifetime as an abolitionist, proposing slaves be emancipated slowly, recognizing the crucial role slavery played in many economies. He hoped his ideas would be adopted by George Washington in order to free the slaves in the United States of America and hopefully spread from there. His efforts were not in vain, as George Washington eventually began implementing Lafayette's practices in his own plantation in Mount Vernon. Also, following Lafayette's death in 1834, his grandson, Gustave de Beaumont released a novel discussing the issues of racism. Lafayette's role in the eventual abolition of slavery in 1794 in France was monumental, as riots in Saint Domingue erupted because of the circulation of his own writing in 1792, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of <b>the</b> <b>Citizen.</b>|$|E

5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} {{is another}} matter. When forming his argument here, Russell specifically targets the doctrines of John Stuart Mill. Russell argues that Mill's {{argument for the}} freedom of speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for political reasons is likely to cause somebody harm. For example, <b>the</b> <b>citizen</b> ought {{to have the opportunity to}} impeach malicious governors, but that would surely harm the governor, at the very least (Russell 1938:179).|$|E
5|$|Due to an overcommitment of {{resources}} {{early in the}} war, the Australian economy suffered badly from manpower shortages as early as 1942. As a result, the government began the demobilisation process before the war was even over, and when it had finally come to an end, the government was necessarily very keen for the demobilisation process to be completed as quickly as possible. Understandably, defence issues were not given a high priority as people tried to rebuild their lives {{after the war and}} as such it was not until 1948 that <b>the</b> <b>Citizen</b> Military Forces (CMF) was reformed.|$|E
