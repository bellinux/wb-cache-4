In 2003, we documented an infestation of C. trifurcata in a commercial pumpkin field near Rosemount, MN, USA. To evaluate C. trifurcata feeding on cucurbits, we conducted laboratory no-choice and choice <b>test</b> <b>feeding</b> studies. In the laboratory, C. trifurcata fed most heavily on cotyledon-stage cucumber plants, followed by pumpkin and squash. With soybean plants present, C. trifurcata still fed on cucumber plants. However, C. trifurcata appeared to prefer soybeans until the quality of the soybean plants was diminished through feeding damage. This is the first known report of C. trifurcata feeding on cucurbits.

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the metabolizable protein (MP) content of common indigenous feedstuffs used in ruminant nutrition using in situ method. Materials and Methods: Nine ruminant feeds such as maize grain (MG), groundnut cake (GNC), mustard oilcake (MOC), cottonseed cake (CSC), deoiled rice bran (DORB), wheat bran (WB), berseem fodder (BF), maize fodder (MF) and sorghum fodder (SF) {{were included in}} this study. Each <b>test</b> <b>feed</b> was dried, ground and chemically analysed for proximate principles (DM, CP, EE, OM, Total ash), fiber fractions (NDF, ADF, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin), NDICP and ADICP. Two adult fistulated bulls were used for evaluating the protein degradation characteristics of each <b>test</b> <b>feed</b> using the nylon bag method. Metabolizable energy (ME) content of the <b>test</b> <b>feeds</b> were predicted from their chemical composition data using summative approach of NRC (2001) model. The equations of AFRC (1992) were used to predict the rumen degradable protein (RDP), digestible microbial protein (DMP), digestible undegraded feed protein (DUP) and MP content of <b>test</b> <b>feeds.</b> Results: The MP content of MG, GNC, MOC, CSC, DORB, WB, BF, MF and SF {{was found to be}} 95. 26, 156. 41, 135. 21, 125. 06, 101. 68, 107. 11, 136. 81, 72. 01 and 76. 65 g/kg DM, respectively. The corresponding ME (MJ/kg DM) content of the <b>test</b> <b>feeds</b> was 13. 66, 13. 12, 13. 65, 10. 68, 9. 08, 11. 56, 9. 64, 8. 33 and 8. 03, respectively. Among the <b>test</b> <b>feeds,</b> GNC contained the highest and MF contained the lowest MP per kg DM. Conclusion: It was concluded that the degradability of crude protein (CP) of the <b>test</b> <b>feeds</b> can be used in MP determination and diet formulation. Feed CP content is not available as such at intestinal level in ruminants as a definite part of it undergoes extensive microbial degradation in rumen. The pattern and extent of such degradation do influence the amount of protein presented to lower digestive tract (MP) for absorption and utilization in ruminants. It was also found that the MP content of a feed is not constant as that of its CP content as it entirely depends on the degradation characteristics in a given animal...|$|R

We conducted an animal study to test if association stress in childhood affects ingestive behavior later in life by using female rats that have an adjusted estrous cycle. First, electrical impedance of the vagina was conducted to test estrous cycle adjustment. Second, the effects of 6 h per day maternal separation from birth to weaning, which models a psychologically stressful experience in childhood, was used to <b>test</b> <b>feeding</b> behavior during an ovarian cycle in female adult rats with matched estrous cycles. Food and water intake in maternal separated and non-separated rats was measured in each estrous phase. Non-separated rats showed periodical changes, but maternal separated rats showed no significant changes in food and water intake during an estrous cycle. An opposing tendency for food and water intake was seen between maternal separated and non-separated rats. These observations suggest that electrical impedance of the vagina showed the highest value in the estrous phase of rats housed in a reversed light-dark cycle, and maternal separation was found to disturb changes in feeding behavior during the estrous cycle.

The purpose of our study was to look at elements of supportive clinical evidence leading to positive diagnosis, and to review these with respect to misdiagnosed cases undergoing negative exploration. Methods All infants undergoing surgical exploration for IHPS between January 2000 and December 2004 were retrospectively analysed with regard to clinical symptoms, examination findings, investigations and operative findings. Results During the study period, 343 explorations were performed with a presumptive {{diagnosis of}} IHPS. Of these, 205 infants (60 %) had a positive <b>test</b> <b>feed,</b> 269 (78 %) had a positive ultrasound scan and 175 (55 %) were alkalotic (pH ≥ 7. 45 and/or base excess ≥ 2. 5). The positive predictive value for an ultrasound (US) diagnosis was 99. 1 % for canal length ≥ 14 mm, and 98. 7 % for muscle thickness ≥ 4 mm. Four infants (1. 1 %) underwent a negative surgical exploration; Ultrasound was positive in 3, and negative in 1 (who underwent surgery {{on the basis of}} a positive upper GI contrast). One US reported as positive had a muscle thickness Conclusion A 1 % rate of negative exploration in IHPS compares favourably with other studies. However potential causes of error were identified in all 4 cases. Confident diagnosis comprises a combination of positive <b>test</b> <b>feed</b> and an 'in house US' in an alkalotic infant.

The aims of thisinvestigation were essentially twofold. First, to evaluate whether the signs oftoxicity, especially with respect to liver and kidney functions, seen after 90 days'consumption of a diet containing NK 603 R-tolerant GM maize [3, 7] escalated into serious ill health or dissipated {{over an extended period}} oftime. Second, to determine if low doses of full commercial R formulation at permittedlevels were still toxic, as indicated by our previous in vitro studies [8, 9]. The previous toxicity study with NK 603 maize employed only this GM crop thathad been sprayed with R during cultivation [3]. However, in our study presented here, in addition to extending the treatmentperiod from 90 days to 2 years and in order to better ascertain the source of any illhealth observed, we included additional <b>test</b> <b>feeding</b> groups. These consisted of NK 603 maize grown without as well as with R application and R alone administered via drinkingwater. Furthermore, we used three levels of dosing in all cases rather than the twopreviously used [3], in order to highlight any dose response effects of a given treatment. It isalso important to note that our study is the first to conduct blood, urine, and organanalyses from animals treated with the complete agricultural formulation of R and notjust G alone, as measured by the manufacturer [35].|$|E

Several issues are still controversial in this field, and among them there are contrasting reports on whether training in a fasting condition can enhance weight loss by stimulating lipolytic activity. The authors' purpose was to verify differences in fat metabolism during training in fasting or feeding conditions. They compared the effect on oxygen consumption (VO 2) and substrate utilization, estimated by the respiratory-exchange ratio (RER), in 8 healthy young men who performed the same moderate-intensity training session (36 min of cardiovascular training on treadmill at 65 % maximum heart rate) in the morning in 2 tests in random sequence: FST test (fasting condition) without any food intake or FED <b>test</b> (<b>feeding</b> condition) after breakfast.

Birds fed the control commercial feed deposited more (p< 0. 05) fat than those fed the <b>test</b> <b>feed.</b> It was concluded that cassava copra meal-based finisher diets could be used to reduce cost of meat production and carcass fat content and thus meat quality of broiler chickens. Further research into appropriate combinations of these ingredients for optimum growth and feed utilisation by broilers is recommended. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundMucositis and {{dysphagia}} {{are common}} {{adverse effects of}} radiotherapy (RT) treatment of locally advanced squamous cell cancer {{of the head and}} neck (LA-SCCHN). Chemotherapy added to RT increases survival rates but causes worse mucositis and dysphagia. The aim of this analysis was to assess the impact of p 16 status on mucositis, dysphagia, and feeding tube use in LA-SCCHN among patients treated with RT±cetuximab in the phase 3 IMCL- 9815 trial. MethodsPatients received RT plus weekly cetuximab or RT alone. Subgroup analyses were conducted on patients with p 16 -positive (n= 75) or p 16 -negative (n= 106) oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), as determined by immunohistochemical analysis. The onset and duration of mucositis and dysphagia by treatment arm and p 16 status were displayed using Kaplan–Meier curves and the log-rank test. P values for the incidence of mucositis and dysphagia were calculated using the Fisher exact <b>test.</b> <b>Feeding</b> tube use was assessed as the percent of patients reporting use. ResultsThe baseline characteristics of patients treated with RT±cetuximab were similar in both the p 16 -positive and p 16 -negative OPC subgroups. Patients within the p 16 -positive OPC subgroup had higher Karnofsky scores and were more likely to have stage T 1 –T 3 cancer and be from the United States. Regardless of p 16 status, there was no difference in the onset or duration of grade 3 / 4 mucositis or dysphagia in patients receiving RT plus cetuximab compared with those receiving RT alone. In the overall population, and the p 16 -positive and p 16 -negative OPC subpopulations, feeding tube use was not different for patients receiving RT plus cetuximab compared with RT alone. ConclusionRegardless of p 16 status, the addition of cetuximab to RT did not alter the incidence, time to onset, severity, or duration of mucositis and dysphagia and did not impact the frequency of feeding tube use...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this trial}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of diet, breed, gender and the tissue on the fatty acid (FA) profiles of lambs of three native Italian sheep breeds. Thirty-six lambs, belonging to flocks subjected to an in situ conservation program (Legnaro-Villiago), were used. Six males and 6 female lambs for each breed: Alpagota, Brogna and Foza, were divided in three groups characterized by different feeding systems: pasture, penned in an open barn and fed with hay and concentrate and penned in the open barn and fed with hay and concentrate added with rpCLA supplement. At the age of 225 days the lambs were slaughtered, samples of muscles, fatty depots and liver were collected and analyzed for FA profile. FA were extracted and analyzed through GC. Data were analyzed by PROC MIXED of SAS considering the effect of the feeding system, breed, gender, age and tissue. The random effect of animal was used to <b>test</b> <b>feeding</b> system, breed, gender and age, whereas the effects of tissue and corresponding interactions were tested on the residual. Among the factors of variation of FA profiles feeding system was the most important one because, respect to the dry diets, pasture did not caused a variation of proportion among SFA, MUFA and PUFA, but changed the proportion within SFA (C 18 : 0;C 18 : 1 vaccenic), and PUFA (C 18 : 2 c 9 t 11 CLA; >C 18 : 3 α Linolenic; <C 20 : 4 n 6 arachidonic), and decreased the omega 6 /omega 3 ratio (3. 28 vs. 6. 17; P< 0. 0002). The supplementation of rpCLA on barn diet increased both CLA isomers (C 18 : 2 c 9, t 11, P= 0. 010, and C 18 : 2 t 10, c 12, P= 0. 018). The tissue was the most important within-animal cause of variation and affected all the individual FA and their categories. Liver presented a FA profile very different from that of muscles and fatty depots and, among these last tissues, kidney fat was very peculiar...|$|E
40|$|Christmas beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) (Anoplognathus spp.) and paropsine leaf beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) are, common {{defoliators}} of eucalypts, {{including several}} important plantation species, throughout south-eastern Australia. It {{has already been}} demonstrated that populations and individuals of several eucalypt species vary in susceptibility to defoliation by these leaf-chewing beetles. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether significant variation in resistance to insect herbivory was present in Eucalyptus grandis genotypes selected from the hardwood plantation program of State Forests of NSW. Grafted clones from three young trees with significantly less crown damage than neighbouring trees in a plantation established near Byron Bay, NSW, were tested for attractiveness to Anoplognathus chloropyrus adults in a binary choice experiment in the laboratory. Shoots from the resistant grafted ramets were paired with shoots from susceptible seedlings of similar age, and caged with feeding A. chloropyrus adults for 24 h. The Christmas beetles consumed significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) less leaf area from the resistant shoots, compared to that consumed from the shoots from susceptible seedlings, when given access to both. The binary choice test method was also used to <b>test</b> <b>feeding</b> preferences of four paropsine chrysomelid species: Paropsis atomaria (adults and larvae), P. variolosa (larvae only), Paropsisterna beata (adults), and a Chrysophtharta sp. (adults), using the same E. grandis genotypes. No significant differences (P > 0. 05) in feeding preferences were detected for P. variolosa larvae, P. atomaria adults, P. beata adults or the Chrysophtharta sp. adults. In contrast, P. atomaria larvae displayed a significant preference for foliage from the susceptible seedlings. In a larval development study using P. atomaria larvae, those reared on the susceptible foliage developed approximately five days faster and had significantly higher survival than those reared on resistant foliage. Several leaf traits were also compared between the two types of foliage. Leaves of similar age from the resistant clones did not differ significantly from the susceptible seedlings in terms of carbon to nitrogen content or concentrations of the monoterpene, 1, 8 -cineole. They did, however, have significantly higher specific leaf weight (SLW). SLW may have the potential for use in rapid screening of E. grandis genotypes for susceptibilty to defoliation by leaf-chewing beetles that prefer young soft foliage. 7 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The present {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to determine the digestion kinetics of carbohydrate fractions of citrus by-products. Grapefruit pulp (GP), lemon pulp (LE), lime pulp (LI) and orange pulp (OP) were the <b>test</b> <b>feed.</b> Digestion kinetic of whole citrus by-products and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) fraction and acid detergent fiber (ADF) fractions of citrus by-products were measured using the in vitro gas production technique. Fermentation kinetics of the neutral detergent soluble carbohydrates (NDSC) fraction and hemicelluloses were calculated using a curve subtraction. The fermentation rate of whole was the highest for the LE (p < 0. 05). For all citrus by-products lag time was longer for hemicellulose than other carbohydrate fractions. There {{was no significant difference}} among potential gas production (A) volumes of whole <b>test</b> <b>feeds</b> (p < 0. 16). Dry matter (DM) digestibility contents of LE and LI were the highest (p < 0. 02). The NDF digestibility was the highest (p < 0. 05) in LI and GP, while the lowest (p < 0. 03) values of ADF digestibility were observed in LI and LE. According to {{the results of the present}} study, carbohydrate fractions of citrus by-products have high potential for degradability. It could also be concluded that carbohydrate fractions of citrus by-products have remarkable difference in digestion kinetics and digestive behavior...|$|R
