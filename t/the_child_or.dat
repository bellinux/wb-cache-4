5|$|The {{database}} {{would not}} hold case or assessment material or any subjective observations. The database could include information of a 'sensitive' nature, defined as {{issues relating to}} sexual health, mental health and substance abuse, although consent from <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>or</b> the child’s guardians would have been needed, {{and it would not}} have appeared as such on the database; it would only note that the child was receiving help from 'sensitive services' and would not say what this was. Refusal of consent could be overridden if this could be justified. Margaret Hodge, then children’s minister, had said that drug or alcohol use by parents, relatives and neighbours, together with other aspects of their behaviour, may be recorded. Government guidelines reveal that other information recorded may have included 'family routines', evidence of a 'disorgan-ised/chaotic lifestyle', 'ways in which the family’s income was used', signs of mental illness or alcohol misuse by relatives, and 'any serious difficulties in the parents’ relationship'.|$|E

25|$|Haloperidol, {{when given}} to {{lactating}} women, {{is found in}} significant amounts in their milk. Breastfed children sometimes show extrapyramidal symptoms. If the use of haloperidol during lactation seems indicated, the benefit for the mother should clearly outweigh the risk for <b>the</b> <b>child,</b> <b>or</b> breastfeeding should be stopped.|$|E

25|$|Psychiatric {{assessment}} always {{includes a}} mental state examination of <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>or</b> adolescent {{which consists of}} a careful behavioral observation and a first-hand account of the young person's subjective experiences. The assessment also includes an observation of the interactions within the family, especially the interactions between the child and his/her parents.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to therapy for <b>the</b> <b>child,</b> <b>or</b> even instead of it, children may benefit if their parents {{speak to a}} therapist, take parenting classes, attend grief counseling, or take other actions to resolve stressful situations that affect the child. Parent management training is a highly effective form of psychotherapy that teaches parents skills to reduce their child's behavior problems.|$|E
25|$|A {{child born}} in Australia (and {{who is not}} {{otherwise}} an Australian citizen) and who lives in Australia automatically acquires Australian citizenship {{on his or her}} 10th birthday, if the child has not been granted or otherwise acquired Australian citizenship in the meantime.

Section 948.07, Wisconsin Statutes, prohibits causing or {{enticing}} a {{child into}} any vehicle, building, room, or secluded {{place with the}} intent to: commit an act of first or second-degree sexual assault; cause the child to engage in prostitution; expose a sex organ to <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>or</b> cause the child to expose a sex organ; or take pictures or make audio recordings of the child engaging in sexually explicit conduct (Class BC felony).|$|E
25|$|Children with {{hyperthyroidism}} tend to {{have greater}} mood swings and disturbances of behavior, as compared with adults. Their attention span decreases, they are usually hyperactive and distractible, they sleep poorly, and their school performance deteriorates. Because devastating personality and emotional changes often appear in <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>or</b> adolescent with Graves' disease, many hyperthyroid children are (similar to many adults) referred to a developmental specialist or child psychiatrist before the presence of hyperthyroidism is suspected.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with other}} species, human {{childbirth}} is dangerous. Painful labors lasting 24 {{hours or more}} are not uncommon and sometimes lead {{to the death of}} the mother, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>or</b> both. This is because of both the relatively large fetal head circumference and the mother's relatively narrow pelvis. The chances of a successful labor increased significantly during the 20th century in wealthier countries with the advent of new medical technologies. In contrast, pregnancy and natural childbirth remain hazardous ordeals in developing regions of the world, with maternal death rates approximately 100 times greater than in developed countries.|$|E

25|$|Concerns {{raised about}} effects of {{coloured}} immigration in communities in his constituency {{played a part}} in his commentary. In March 1968, the month before the Rivers of Blood speech, he made his first public references to them in a speech in Walsall, when he described the concern of an anonymous constituent whose daughter was the only white child in her primary school class and suffered bullying from non-white pupils. When Wolverhampton Express and Star journalists failed to find <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>or</b> the class, the paper's editor and a then personal friend, Clement Jones, challenged him, stating Jones himself had similar anonymous complaints that were traced to members of the National Front (NF). Powell would not accept the explanation and told Jones he had received 'bags of supporting mail' {{as a result of the}} Walsall speech.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations' 1989 Convention on the Rights of <b>the</b> <b>Child,</b> <b>or</b> CRC, is {{the first}} legally binding {{international}} instrument to incorporate {{the full range of}} human rights—civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. Its implementation is monitored by the Committee on the Rights of the Child. National governments that ratify it commit themselves to protecting and ensuring children's rights, and agree to hold themselves accountable for this commitment before the international community. The CRC is the most widely ratified human rights treaty with 195 ratifications. South Sudan and the United States are the only two countries which have not ratified the CRC. The CRC is based on four core principles, namely the principle of non discrimination, {{the best interests of the}} child, the right to life, survival and development, and considering the views of the child in decisions which affect them (according to their age and maturity). The CRC, along with international criminal accountability mechanisms such as the International Criminal Court, the Yugoslavia and Rwanda Tribunals, and the Special Court for Sierra Leone, is said to have significantly increased the profile of children's rights worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Bohemond III of Antioch, {{also known}} as Bohemond <b>the</b> <b>Child</b> <b>or</b> the Stammerer ( [...] ; 1148–1201), was Prince of Antioch from 1163 to 1201. He was the elder son of Constance of Antioch and her first husband, Raymond of Poitiers. Bohemond ascended to the throne after the Antiochene noblemen dethroned his mother with the {{assistance}} of Thoros II, Lord of Armenian Cilicia. He fell into captivity in the Battle of Artah in 1164, but the victorious Nur ad-Din, atabeg of Aleppo released him to avoid coming into conflict with the Byzantine Empire. Bohemond went to Constantinople to pay homage to Manuel I Komnenos, who persuaded him to install a Greek Orthodox Patriarch in Antioch. The Latin Patriarch of Antioch, Aimery of Limoges, placed Antioch under interdict. Bohemond restored Aimery only after the Greek patriarch died during an earthquake in 1170.|$|E

500|$|Boisselier {{confidently}} {{announced at}} a press conference in Florida in December 2002 that Clonaid had successfully produced a live-born clone, named Eve, for an infertile couple. Canadian sociologist Susan J. Palmer notes that naming the cloned child [...] "Eve" [...] recalls Raël's teachings that aliens created the first humans through cloning. After the announcement, Boisselier received abundant press, but the media, particularly late-night comedy programs, criticized her glamorous appearance and mocked Raëlism. Around that time, Boisselier appeared on many U.S. network news broadcasts and on CNN. She did not provide details about <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>or</b> its family, although she was often asked to. She hired a science editor from ABC to supervise verification of the cloning. Many scientists doubted that the Raëlians could overcome the difficulties that human cloning posed, or that {{they would be able to}} produce a healthy child. Boisselier said a DNA test was forthcoming and announced that five more clones would be born later that winter. As Raël and Boisselier continued to seek media exposure, journalistic animosity towards them grew.|$|E
