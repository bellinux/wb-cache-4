5|$|From the {{beginning}} of its history to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>century</b> AD Palmyra was a petty sheikhdom, and by <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>century</b> BC a Palmyrene identity began to develop. During {{the first half of}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>century</b> AD, Palmyra incorporated some of the institutions of a Greek city (polis); the concept of citizenship (demos) appears in an inscription, dated to AD 10, describing the Palmyrenes as a community. In AD 74, an inscription mentions the city's boule (senate). The tribal role in Palmyra is debated; during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>century,</b> four treasurers representing the four tribes seems to have partially controlled the administration but their role became ceremonial by the second century and power rested {{in the hands of the}} council.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} Palmyrene text attesting a Roman {{presence in}} the city dates to 18AD, when the Roman general Germanicus tried to develop a friendly relationship with Parthia; he sent the Palmyrene Alexandros to Mesene, a Parthian vassal kingdom. This {{was followed by the}} arrival of the Roman legion Legio X Fretensis the following year. Roman authority was minimal during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>century</b> AD, although tax collectors were resident, and a road connecting Palmyra and Sura was built in AD 75. The Romans used Palmyrene soldiers, but (unlike typical Roman cities) no local magistrates or prefects are recorded in the city. Palmyra saw intensive construction during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>century,</b> including the city's first walled fortifications, and the Temple of Bel (completed and dedicated in 32AD). During <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>century</b> Palmyra developed from a minor desert caravan station into a leading trading center, with Palmyrene merchants establishing colonies in surrounding trade centers.|$|E
5|$|The {{etymology}} of London is uncertain.

5|$|Although Herod's {{renovation}} of the Second Temple was initiated in late 1st century BCE, excavations beneath the street near the arch revealed three oil lamps of a type common in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>century</b> CE and 17 identifiable coins, several of which were struck by Valerius Gratus, Roman procurator of Judea, in the year 17/18 CE. This means that the arch and nearby sections of the Western Wall were constructed after this date.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that the mysteries developed after Isis's Hellenized cult reached Greece itself, later in the third century BCE. Much of the early evidence of Isis worship in Greece comes from aretalogies, poems in praise of the goddess. The wording of aretalogies from Maroneia and Andros, both from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>century</b> BCE, closely links Isis with mystery rites. Petra Pakkanen says that these aretalogies prove the mysteries of Isis existed by that time, but Jan Bremmer argues that they only connect Isis with the Eleusinian Mysteries, not with distinctive rites of her own. Stronger evidence for mysteries of Isis is found in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>century</b> CE, and they certainly existed in the second. Temples to Isis in Greece may have developed their mysteries {{in response to the}} widespread belief that the Greek mystery cults had originated with Isis and Osiris in Egypt. They could have adapted elements of Eleusinian rites, and perhaps Dionysian mysteries as well, to reflect Egyptian mythology. The end product would have seemed to the Greeks like an authentic Egyptian precursor to Greek mysteries. Many Greco-Roman sources claim that Isis herself devised these rites.|$|E
5|$|Another {{work from}} Ancient Greece that made an early impact on botany is De Materia Medica, a five-volume {{encyclopedia}} about herbal medicine {{written in the}} middle of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>century</b> by Greek physician and pharmacologist Pedanius Dioscorides. De Materia Medica was widely read for more than 1,500 years. Important contributions from the medieval Muslim world include Ibn Wahshiyya's Nabatean Agriculture, Abū Ḥanīfa Dīnawarī's (828–896) the Book of Plants, and Ibn Bassal's The Classification of Soils. In the early 13th century, Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, and Ibn al-Baitar (d. 1248) wrote on botany in a systematic and scientific manner.|$|E

5|$|Because the Bill of Rights did not {{initially}} {{apply to the}} states, and federal criminal investigations were less common in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>century</b> of the nation's history, there is little significant case law for the Fourth Amendment before the 20th century.

5|$|Commonwealth {{forces were}} engaged in {{numerous}} conflicts in the south (against the Ottoman Empire), the east (against the Tsardom of Muscovy and later, the Russian Empire) and the north (the Kingdom of Sweden); as well as internal conflicts (most notably, numerous Cossack uprisings). For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>century</b> or so, the Commonwealth military was usually successful, but became less so from around the mid-17th century. Plagued by insufficient funds, it found itself increasingly hard-pressed to defend the country, and inferior in numbers to the growing armies of the Commonwealth's neighbors.|$|E
5|$|Epidemics accidentally {{introduced}} by the Spanish included smallpox, measles and influenza. These diseases, together with typhus and yellow fever, had {{a major impact on}} Maya populations. The Old World diseases brought with the Spanish and against which the indigenous New World peoples had no resistance were a deciding factor in the conquest; the diseases crippled armies and decimated populations before battles were even fought.

5|$|Excavations {{have also}} {{uncovered}} Roman remains, indicating agricultural and industrial activity {{from the second}} half of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>century</b> to third century AD.
