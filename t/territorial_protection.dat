A special status in the form partial self-determination and fixed protection for Swedish language in Swedish-speaking municipalities have been proposed in Finland's Swedish-speaking media.|$|E
25|$|The frills of ceratopsians are {{incredibly}} diverse. They {{may have been}} used for protective purposes as the frill sometimes splays over the neck. However, some say that the frill would have provided little protection from other large dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus. Other possible functions include intraspecific communication for mating purposes or as a visual display of <b>territorial</b> <b>protection,</b> as seen in many common day organisms such as red-breasted robins. The frills also could have been used for species recognition purposes, as they seem to develop fairly early in life. There has also been evidence that ceratopsians care for their young, as bone-beds have been found of adult individuals with a nest of juveniles, although some refute this as viable evidence of care for young. There have also been bone-beds found with hundreds of adult ceratopsians, indicating herd activity. A few specimens have been found with puncture wounds, supporting the use of horns as protective or combative weapons. Other research examining juvenile ceratopsians reveals a change in horn morphology over time, suggesting frills and horns could have been used for intraspecific communication of age. Horns also could have been used for thermoregulation as indicated by isotope analysis, as aid in knocking down vegetation, or for horn-locking agonistic behavior.|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the Serbs throughout the Balkans sought unification under a single state. In addition to the Kingdom of Serbia and the Principality of Montenegro, two states with predominantly ethnic Serb populations that didn't yet share a common border, many more Serbs lived within the borders of neighbouring Austria-Hungary (specifically Bosnia-Herzegovina condominium, Croatia-Slavonia, and southern part of Hungary) as well as Ottoman Empire (Bosnia Vilayet, Kosovo Vilayet, Sanjak of Novi Pazar, {{and to a lesser extent}} in parts of Monastir Vilayet and Salonica Vilayet). With the Austria-Hungarian 1908 annexation of Bosnia (where there was a heavy concentration of Serbs) as well as the resulting Annexation Crisis, the Serbs expressed a need for cultural and <b>territorial</b> <b>protection,</b> which gave rise to the Narodna Odbrana.|$|E
40|$|In the United States, {{the policy}} of {{localism}} – the legislative goal of fostering local community expression and competence to deliver local content – finds its home in the Telecommunications Act rather than either the Copyright Act or Trademark Act. Other nations have introduced values of localism into trade policy, content distribution rules, and international efforts to protect intangible cultural heritage and expressions of folklore. Jurisdictions in every continent are struggling to address the pressures of globalism through efforts to protect indigenous peoples’ and minority communities’ languages and culture. These efforts take many forms. Nations have introduced efforts to protect these interests into trade policy, content distribution rules, and the legal regimes of copyright and trademark. Some jurisdictions, for example, emphasize the need for historical preservation of particular culture and content. Other jurisdictions emphasize localism to promote domestic employment and economic growth. At the same time, however, other regulators are cloaking governmental censorship {{under the guise of}} protectionism. These efforts assume, arguendo, that some model of protectionism is necessary to assist these communities. Because there are many different types of intangible cultural heritage – local languages, tribal customs, religious traditions, folklore, styles of artworks, etc. – this assumption may be counterproductive. Particularly in our increasingly networked, global information community, assumptions of <b>territorial</b> <b>protections</b> must be reconsidered. This article reviews the underlying societal imperatives reflected in a policy of intangible cultural heritage and the intellectual property-like regimes being developed to protect these interests. It contrasts UNESCO efforts with more narrowly tailored efforts of WIPO and juxtaposes those approaches with the localism model developed under the FCC. While aspects of the WIPO protection efforts focusing on trademark-like and trade secret-like protections benefit the people and cultures these policies hope to serve, additional copyright-like protections will likely do more harm than good. Instead, global public policy will be far better served through emphasis on localism’s attributes of developing human capital {{to improve the quality of}} content being produced and encouraging local communities to focus on the content of their own choosing.

50|$|Boxer crabs in {{the genus}} Lybia have {{developed}} a mutualistic relationship with small sea anemones such as Triactis producta. The crab's front limbs have modified chelae, each of which can gently grip a sea anemone by its column, and it usually holds one in each claw. The living anemone is brandished like a weapon to keep predators away and is also used in ritualistic <b>territorial</b> <b>protection.</b> The sea anemones used are small and seldom exceed a column height of 8 mm. If it loses one of its anemones, the crab can tear the other one in half, after which each part grows into a new individual. The crab also uses the anemones to immobilise and capture prey on its behalf. The sea anemones seem unharmed by being used in this way.|$|E

40|$|In {{this essay}} the author will analyse {{selected}} {{aspects of the}} process of arranging traditional space {{in the face of the}} challenges of modernity. Progressive globalisation, cultural changes, social transformations - all these processes have influenced the ways local communities manage their territory. He will mainly deal with the phenomenon of reterritorialisation, focus on how identification with territory is reinforced in local communities. He will show how cultural legacy, characteristic of a given region, shapes particular versions of locality and globalisation. The role of ethnicity in these processes is of special interest. Is ethnic identification still taken into account in social strategies embedded in the processes of globalisation? In the first part he argues that modernity introduces irreversible changes to the character of existing and ethnically defined space. The second part includes arguments supporting the thesis about the necessity of adjusting to modern strategies of region management, which must entail partially giving up <b>territorial</b> identity <b>protection.</b> In spite of this, in the process of ethnic construction of a region, space seems to constitute a social framework which determines points of reference for collective action and conceptualisation of new reality...|$|R
50|$|Supernormal Stimuli: How Primal Urges Overran Their Evolutionary Purpose {{is a book}} by Deirdre Barrett {{published}} by W. W. Norton & Company in 2010. Barrett is a psychologist {{on the faculty of}} Harvard Medical School. The book argues that human instincts for food, sex, and <b>territorial</b> <b>protection</b> evolved for life on the savannah 10,000 years ago, not for today’s densely populated technological world. Our instincts have not had time to adapt to the rapid changes of modern life.The book takes its title from Nikolaas Tinbergen's concept in animal ethology of the supernormal stimulus, the phenomena by which insects, birds, and fish in his experiments could be lured by a dummy object which exaggerated one or more characteristic of the natural stimulus object such as giant brilliant blue plaster eggs which birds preferred to sit on in preference to their own. Barrett extends the concept to humans and outlines how supernormal stimuli are a driving force behind today’s most pressing problems, including modern warfare, obesity and other fitness problems, while also explaining the appeal of television, video games, and pornography as social outlets.|$|E
50|$|On 5 April 2007, White House {{officials}} announced a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposal to shoot barred owls {{to reduce the}} threat they pose to the spotted owl. It called for delineating 18 sites {{within the range of}} the spotted owl where 12-32 barred owls would be taken per site for 5 to 10 years. Approximately 2150 to 2850 barred owls would be killed for a 3- to 5-year study, and 4650 Barred Owls would be killed for a 10-year study If the precedent-setting removal study is implemented, it would, during its first year, result in the death of 36 times more raptors than in all other conservation-based projects combined in the United States and its territories, and 84 times more raptors than in the largest ongoing effort worldwide, at a cost of $1 million annually; simplifying the cost to dollars per barred owl killed approximates $700 per barred owl for the first year and $2800 per barred owl for each subsequent year.

The research categorizes Canadian jurisdictions’ approaches to EHR regulation and three models are identified. Using five criteria, the patient experience when interacting with each of the three models and a combination of the models is described, analyzed and reconciled. A fictional patient scenario is used as a tool to analyze patient interaction with the Canadian jurisdictions and the models. It is shown that, although Canadian jurisdictions use one of three separate modes of incorporating EHR-specific rules into legislation, the outcome of this variation is not entirely disparate, in terms of (a) the way EHRs are defined, and (b) the ways in which (i) consent to collection, (ii) limited use, (iii) security safeguards and (iv) patient participation are addressed...|$|R
