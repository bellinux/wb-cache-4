5|$|At the 20th century's end, Gaddafi—frustrated by {{the failure}} of his Pan-Arab ideals—increasingly {{rejected}} Arab nationalism in favour of Pan-Africanism, emphasising Libya's African identity. From 1997 to 2000, Libya initiated cooperative agreements or bilateral aid arrangements with 10 African states, and in 1999 joined the Community of Sahel-Saharan States. In June 1999, Gaddafi visited Mandela in South Africa, and the following month attended the OAU summit in Algiers, calling for greater political and economic integration across the continent and advocating the foundation of a United States of Africa. He became {{one of the founders of}} the African Union (AU), initiated in July 2002 to replace the OAU; at the opening ceremonies, he called for African states to reject conditional aid from the developed world, a direct contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> of South African President Thabo Mbeki.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{time offset}} (BTO) – the time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent from the ground station and when the response is received. This measure is proportional to twice {{the distance from the}} ground station via the satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> and time between reception and processing at the ground station. This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft. As a result, one can define a circle on the Earth's surface the points on whose circumference are equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance, and in turn this circle can be reduced to arcs by eliminating parts of the circle that are outside the aircraft's range.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{timing offset}} (BTO) — The time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent {{from the ground}} station and when the response is received.

This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft and results in a ring on the Earth's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance.|$|E

Raiden concludes that Liu Kang must win the tournament to save Earthrealm. During the tournament, Liu Kang becomes the only {{remaining}} Earthrealm contender, due in part to Scorpion's murder of Bi-Han, in retaliation for the latter's murder of the Shirai Ryu clan some years earlier. Liu Kang is successful in defeating the Shokan Prince Goro, as well as Shang Tsung. Raiden's amulet, however, cracks, a sign that future events are unchanged. Disappointed with the sorcerer's failure, emperor Shao Kahn orders Shang Tsung's execution, but is convinced otherwise when the sorcerer suggests holding the second tournament in Outworld. Though initially refusing, Raiden relents when tarkatans invade Earth and Shang Tsung threatens to unleash all of Outworld's armies upon Earthrealm.|$|E
5|$|Studio Ghibli {{released}} {{an adaptation of}} the series in 2006 titled Tales from Earthsea. The film very loosely combines elements of the first, third, and fourth books into a new story. Le Guin commented with displeasure on the film-making process, saying that she had acquiesced to the adaptation believing Hayao Miyazaki would be producing the film himself, which was eventually not the case. Le Guin praised the imagery of the film, but disliked the use of violence. She also expressed dissatisfaction with the portrayal of morality, {{and in particular the}} use of a villain who could be slain as a means of resolving conflict, which she said was antithetical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> of the book. The film received generally mixed responses.|$|E

Codreanu claimed to had a vision of the Archangel Michael who told him he had been chosen by God to be Romania's savior.

25|$|Supreme Court Holding, Clark v.
