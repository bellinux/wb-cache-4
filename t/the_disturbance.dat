30|$|Although {{many studies}} have made inferences {{regarding}} the nature of bark beetle-fire interactions based on changes in fire severity, relatively few have directly assessed if these changes are due to an interaction between <b>the</b> two <b>disturbances.</b> <b>The</b> nature {{of the interaction between}} two disturbances is classified as either neutral or linked depending upon the combined impact of <b>the</b> two <b>disturbances</b> relative to <b>the</b> sum of the effects of <b>the</b> independent <b>disturbances.</b> If bark beetles and fire are linked <b>disturbances,</b> <b>the</b> linkage can be either synergistic, in which the combined severity is greater than the total severity of <b>the</b> two <b>disturbances</b> occurring independently, or antagonistic, in which <b>the</b> combined <b>disturbance</b> severity is lower than the severity if <b>the</b> <b>disturbances</b> occurred independently (Turner and Bratton 1987). If we define severity as the combined loss of canopy foliar mass due to <b>the</b> <b>disturbances,</b> then a synergistic bark beetle-fire interaction would result in greater foliar mass loss relative to the sum of independent bark beetle outbreaks and wildfires. In contrast, an antagonistic bark beetle-fire interaction would result in a net mass loss relative to the sum of <b>the</b> two <b>disturbances</b> occurring independently. Alternatively, if <b>the</b> two <b>disturbances</b> are not linked, they are considered neutral (also called additive), as mass loss of <b>the</b> combined <b>disturbances</b> is similar to the mass loss of <b>the</b> <b>disturbances</b> occurring independently (Turner and Bratton 1987).|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Barry {{originated}} from a tropical disturbance {{that left the}} Northwestern African coast on August 13. Most of the season, the northwestern tropical Atlantic Ocean had upper-level wind shear, which had inhibited development of systems. Due to these conditions, <b>the</b> <b>disturbance</b> was unable to strengthen until August 22 as it was approaching the Bahamas. A weak trough moved <b>the</b> <b>disturbance</b> into an area of low wind shear, and <b>the</b> <b>disturbance</b> intensified into Tropical Depression Four {{on the evening of}} August 23. The depression was just to the northeast of the northern Bahamian Islands where it strengthened into Tropical Storm Barry on the morning of August 24.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of Hurricane Ophelia is attributed {{in part to}} a low-latitude tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa in mid-September. As the wave tracked westward, it began to interact with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and was subsequently introduced with a low chance of tropical development in the National Hurricane Center's (NHC) 48-hour Tropical Weather Outlook. Though atmospheric wind shear was only marginally favorable, the cloud pattern organized, and a surface low-pressure area developed in association with <b>the</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Deep shower and thunderstorm activity continued to fire as <b>the</b> <b>disturbance</b> moved in a general westward motion, and it was assessed with a high chance of development by early on September19. Following satellite trends and data from the Advanced Scatterometer, <b>the</b> <b>disturbance</b> was upgraded to a tropical depression at 1800UTC the following day, while positioned roughly 1300mi (2090km) east of the Lesser Antilles, and to a tropical storm six hours later.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Faye {{originated}} from a westward-moving weak area of disturbed weather {{located within the}} Philippine Sea {{in the middle of}} August. On August16, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started monitoring <b>the</b> <b>disturbance</b> for possible development. Initially, little development was expected due to its close proximity to land and Typhoon Ellis. <b>The</b> <b>disturbance</b> was poorly organized and the atmospheric circulation was exposed from the deep convection despite being located near an anticyclone, which tends to favor tropical cyclogenesis. On August20, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking <b>the</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Later that day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also started monitoring the storm, assigning it with the local name Norming. After emerging into the South China Sea, the storm began to intensify. Later on the morning of August20, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for <b>the</b> <b>disturbance.</b> At 0000 UTC on August21, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression. Six hours later, the agency determined that the depression attained tropical storm status, naming it Faye.|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of <b>the</b> vibrational <b>disturbances</b> of <b>the</b> Hubble Space Telescope that were discovered soon after deployment in orbit {{is described in}} detail.

This paper describes {{the process by which}} the vibrations were characterized and isolated to a particular mechanism. The analysis of the flight data and comparisons with computer simulation results showed that the source of <b>the</b> <b>disturbances</b> was <b>the</b> thermally driven deformation of the solar arrays in conjunction with frictional effects in the array mechanisms. The control system was successfully modified to attenuate <b>the</b> <b>disturbances</b> to tolerable levels pending mechanical and thermal redesign of the solar arrays.

5|$|With weak {{steering}} currents {{provided by}} {{an area of}} high pressure to the north, <b>the</b> <b>disturbance</b> slowly moved towards the east-southeast. At 1500UTC, the JTWC began issuing advisories on <b>the</b> <b>disturbance</b> which they designated as Tropical Cyclone 16S. With high oceanic heat content, low wind shear, and good divergence aloft, significant strengthening was likely. Early the next day, Météo-France upgraded <b>the</b> <b>disturbance</b> to a tropical depression as winds increased to 55km/h (35mph 10-minute winds). However, in the post-season analysis, Météo-France determined that the system had become a depression about 12hours earlier and was already a moderate tropical storm {{by the time of}} the operation upgrade. At 0600UTC, Météo-France classified the depression as a moderate tropical storm and was given the name Hondo; a name submitted to the World Meteorological Organization by Zimbabwe. It was later determined that Hondo was already a severe tropical storm by the time it was named operationally.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance was observed on November19 about 800km (500mi) southeast of Colombo, Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal. <b>The</b> <b>disturbance</b> tracked westward, gradually organizing and prompting the JTWC {{to issue a}} Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on November22. After passing south of Sri Lanka, it became disorganized and was no longer considered likely to develop into a tropical cyclone. The circulation associated with the system continued westward, reorganizing on November26 in the Arabian Sea. Despite being located unusually close to the equator, <b>the</b> <b>disturbance</b> maintained convection, or thunderstorms, which was becoming organized around the weak low-level circulation. With low wind shear and diffluence aloft, the JTWC remarked the system had a fair chance of developing.|$|E
5|$|A weather system {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September3. <b>The</b> <b>disturbance</b> was small and became unidentifiable within 24hours of formation. Satellite imagery {{indicated}} that <b>the</b> <b>disturbance</b> may have acquired a circulation on September7, but the circulation was gone by the next day. The remaining tropical wave moved into the Lesser Antilles on September11 and a reconnaissance aircraft was deployed. The aircraft found circulation; however, by the next day, only a strong wave was detected. Atmospheric conditions became more favorable for development, yielding lower wind shear near Hispaniola for several days. The system moved into this area as the latest Reconnaissance aircraft was deployed, declaring it a tropical depression on September13 near the Dominican Republic.|$|E

40|$|This thesis proposes and justifies {{parameter}} estimates in two semiparametric {{models for}} economic time series.

In the second model <b>the</b> <b>disturbances</b> are both linearly serially correlated and heteroscedastic, the serial correlation and heteroscedasticity being of unknown form. For both models estimates of the regression coefficients of generalized least squares type are proposed, and shown {{to have the same}} limiting distribution as estimates based on correct parameterization of the relevant features of <b>the</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Monte-Carlo simulation evidence of the finite sample performance of both estimates is reported...|$|R

5|$|During late August {{and early}} September1986, the Western Pacific monsoon trough became {{displaced}} to the east. Lower than normal pressures favored {{the building of}} convection over the trough. By the evening of September9, a pronounced area of disturbed weather developed southwest of the Truk Atoll. Aided by low wind shear, <b>the</b> <b>disturbance</b> developed slowly, even though the Hurricane Hunters initially failed to find a well-defined center. <b>The</b> <b>disturbance</b> drifted towards the northwest, and early on September12, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the system.

5|$|Early on September 27, 1976, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) {{reported}} that a tropical disturbance had formed about 770km (480mi) to the southwest of San Jose, Costa Rica.

5|$|In late April, {{an area of}} {{convection}} persisted {{southwest of}} Diego Garcia in the southern Indian Ocean. The system had a low-level circulation and pulsating thunderstorm activity. Located {{in an area of}} weak to moderate wind shear, the convection gradually organized while developing outflow. On May2, a secondary area of convection, also with an accompanying circulation, formed to the northwest, and also showed signs of development. That day, the original disturbance organized enough for Météo-France (MFR) to designate it Tropical Disturbance 16 at 1200UTC. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued tropical cyclone formation alerts for both systems within a 14‑hour period, and upgraded the original system to Tropical Cyclone 18S on May3 about 980km (610mi) northeast of Mauritius. Due to <b>the</b> <b>disturbance</b> to the northwest, as well as a building ridge to the northeast, the system continued to the southwest.
