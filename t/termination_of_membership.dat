The task of this thesis is to describe in detail the means <b>of</b> establishment and <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> a <b>membership</b> in a cooperative society. This thesis provides a comprehensive explanation of individual means, especially with respect to the terms and their legal consequences. My goal was to point out the problematic issues and describe how those issues are resolved in theory and how they are solved by legal practice. I also attempted to compare those issues with foreign regulation, especially with German and Austrian ones. It was necessary to compare the Czech regulation with international cooperative principles since the Czech understanding of a cooperative law is frequently challenged by misunderstanding of those principles. Apart from the general principles applicable to all cooperative societies, I was in detail describing housing cooperative associations and European cooperative society [...] ...|$|R

The episode, described by Iorga himself as a stormy but patriotic debut in public affairs, prompted his adversaries at the Academy to demand the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> his <b>membership</b> for undignified behavior. Tocilescu felt insulted by the allegations, challenged Iorga to a duel, but his friends intervened to mediate. Another scientist who encountered Iorga's wrath was George Ionescu-Gion, against whom Iorga enlisted negative arguments that, as he later admitted, were exaggerated.

2500|$|Algeria's {{representative}} {{in the debates}} submitted that {{to recognize that the}} government of the People's Republic of China was lawfully entitled to represent China did not imply the eviction of a member but the eviction of the representatives of a dissident minority regime. The U.S. in its submission took the opposite view, arguing that adoption of the resolution expelling the representatives sent from Taipei would imply the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>membership</b> <b>of</b> a longstanding member. The spokesman of the Republic of China submitted that his country had earned its place in the United Nations by virtue of its contribution to peace and freedom during the Second World War. He said the Chinese communist regime, which had [...] never had the moral consent of the Chinese people, could in no way be regarded as the representative of the great Chinese nation. Various members including two permanent members of the security council, the United Kingdom and the USSR, argued that requiring the matter to be subject to a supermajority vote was not appropriate because the adoption of the Albanian proposed resolution did not involve the admission or expulsion of a member. Rather it concerned only credentials and Taiwan had never been a member. They argued there was only one Chinese state that was a member. Any other Chinese state would have to apply for membership in accordance with the Charter.|$|R

The purpose {{of the work is}} to inform about the legal consequences arising from the use of the contract of association at the privatization of flats or block of flats. Association founded by an agreement under the provision of § 829 and next of the Civil Code, is not a legal person. It is a contract in which the parties agree that they will coordinate their activities in order to achieve the agreed purpose - the purchase of housing.

The general section also contains the definition of the notion of characteristics of the association agreement, discusses the creation and <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> a <b>membership,</b> it {{deals with the}} conduct of members in respect of third persons, defines the rights and obligations tied to a membership in an association and deals with other aspects of the association agreement according to the legislation in force.

Besides, the sustainability of the pension system may be negatively affected due to the decreased immigration from other EU member states. Also, there is a need to reconstruction of the security and defence policies, which on the other hand may meet obstacles to remain the cost-efficiency...|$|R

It aims {{not only to}} analyse current Czech legislation including existing case law, but also to outline possible proposals of amendments (de lege ferenda considerations).

The first chapter is concerned with general issues of labour law - its concept and function, its role in legal system, its relation to civil law and directory or mandatory nature of labour law rules. The second chapter provides a basic analysis of further ways <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> employment relationship, which are further legal acts leading to <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> employment (i. e. agreement on <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> employment, instant <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> employment, <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> employment during the probationary period), <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> employment {{on the basis of}} an official decision and <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> employment by legal events.
