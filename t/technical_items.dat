40|$|A known {{problem in}} large {{software}} companies is {{to balance the}} prioritization of short-term with long-term viability. Specifically, architecture violations (Architecture Technical Debt) taken to deliver fast might hinder future feature development. However, some technical debt requires more interest to be paid than other. We have investigated which <b>Technical</b> Debt <b>items</b> generate more effort and how this effort is manifested during software development. We conducted a multiple-case embedded case study comprehending 7 sites at 5 large international software companies.

40|$|The core {{question}} in this master thesis is: What {{happens to the}} essence of an object when it becomes out of date {{and is no longer}} in use? I am addressing the sense of dignity in once meticulously designed technical/mechanical items that now has become obsolete. The intention has been to investigate how to give new meaning to obsolete items and find new eligibility for their existence.   The investigation was conducted through the development of a method: collection, analysis, deconstruction, investigation and resurrection of a number of O. T. M. I. (Obsolete <b>Technical</b> Mechanical <b>Items).</b>   The resurrection process consisted of the (re-) writing of the objects’ narratives. These stories along with the objects’ parts, spaces and sounds created a frame for a scenography, a soundtrack and characters to act in a film to tell the story. As interior designers we have the opportunity to transform space and fill it with stories. Imagination is an important tool: We benefit from having the ability to imagine, for instance, how different surfaces will reflect sound and light. Our imagination is highly visual. So I have transformed my imaginary world of Obsolete <b>Technical</b> Mechanical <b>Items</b> to visual and audial elements that support the content and values of a story through researching the objects, finding how to clarify and support the story.

40|$|Condition-based {{maintenance}} is a preventive maintenance strategy where intervention times are determined based on knowledge of actual item condition provided by condition monitoring. In this report condition-based {{maintenance is}} modelled {{by a special}} case of competing risks where only two risks are present. That is maintenance and failure. The two risks are thought to compete to end the service sojourn of a <b>technical</b> <b>item,</b> and maintenance {{is considered to be}} censoring of the latent failure times. As maintenance intervention times are based on indications of emerging failures, then maintenance and failure are assumed to be dependent competing risks. Also, the probability of detecting indications of emerging failures and with that successfully perform maintenance is assumed to be independent of the age of the item. In this thesis the above described case is modelled in particular by a random signs censoring model. Several methods are proposed in order to simulate data from the desired model, and two methods are chosen for further study. That is simulation of desired competing risks data by first hitting times in Wiener processes, and by a method where failures occur at random and maintenance can be performed some time prior to this. The two chosen methods are implemented in the statistical software R in order to make use of them in a practical case study. The case study originates from {{the oil and gas industry}} and aims at assessing the effect on availability by applying condition-based maintenance to a subsea pump. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{technical}} debt {{has been used as}} a useful means for making the intrinsic cost of the internal software quality weaknesses visible. This visibility is made possible by quantifying this cost. Specifically, technical debt is expressed in terms of two main concepts: principal and interest. The principal is the cost of eliminating or reducing the impact of a, so called, <b>technical</b> debt <b>item</b> in a software system; whereas the interest is the recurring cost, over a time period, of not eliminating a <b>technical</b> debt <b>item.</b> Previous works about technical debt are mainly focused on estimating principal and interest, and on performing a cost-benefit analysis. This cost-benefit analysis allows one to determine if to remove technical debt is profitable and to prioritize which <b>items</b> incurring in <b>technical</b> debt should be fixed first. Nevertheless, for these previous works technical debt is flat along the time. However the introduction of new factors to estimate technical debt may produce non flat models that allow us to produce more accurate predictions. These factors should be used to estimate principal and interest, and to perform cost-benefit analysis related to technical debt. In this paper, we take a step forward introducing the uncertainty about the interest, and the time frame factors so that it becomes possible to depict a number of possible future scenarios. Estimations obtained without considering the possible evolution of the interest over time may be less accurate as they consider simplistic scenarios without changes...|$|R

As part of the regulatory standardi-zation effort, the staff has prepared generic standard {{technical specifications}} (STS) for each of the light water reactor nuclear steam supply system and associated balance of plant equipment systems. These STS's are subject to revision and the latest versions are available from the Division of Technical Information and Docu-ment Control, NRC. The initial implementation of the STS-program was made on the D. C. Cook operating license issued in October 1974. All subsequent operating licenses issued by the Commission will utilize the appropriate generic STS as the basis for issuance of Appendix A of licenses, "Technical Specifications.

The educational significance of 10 cases of delivery assistance was reviewed. The technical standards of the students improved with accumulation of experience in the assistance of deliveries. Evaluation of the methods in which the students were assessed with regard to technical improvement in delivery assistance was performed. Of the total number of 136 students of midwifery registered at our school in the past 7 years, 50 who were able to assist successively in 3 - 10 cases of normal childbirth were evaluated in this study with regard to their acquisition of skills needed to assist in deliveries. Fourteen <b>technical</b> <b>items</b> related to the assistance of delivery in its second and third stages were assessed. An evaluation standard consisting of 3 grades, namely "able to perform", "somehow able to perform", and "not able to perform" regarding the above mentioned 14 <b>technical</b> <b>items</b> were used to assess the mastery of delivery assistance techniques by the students. Our results showed that as the students accumulated experience in delivery assistance, self-assessment ratings of "able to perform" increased on the average. The accumulation of skill concerning the management of the neonate immediately after birth, the instruction of patients regarding the application of abdominal pressure, and the assistance during crowning was specially evident. In contrast, although self-assessment ratings of "able to perform" with regard to "assistance of the mother immediately after giving birth" and "assistance immediately after the delivery of the fetal head" did increase, its rate of increase was small...|$|E

40|$|The robust {{design of}} the mass-produced British {{football}} boot from {{the late nineteenth century}} onwards appeared to evolve rather slowly compared with subsequent lightweight, flexible ‘continental’ fabrication. However, with careful reading we can identify considerable overlap and influence between manufacturers, distributors and retailers. Boot and shoe manufacturing was an intensely competitive industry and it was in the interests of entrepreneurs to pioneer advances in order to promote a particular brand. In developing football boots for the mass market this may have included much pseudo-science but even small innovations sought to improve performance and market share. Design ambiguities were also inherent because footwear manufacturers routinely borrowed and appropriated successful design elements for their own products. With more choice and consumer demand, football boots became increasingly less adapted from other outdoor footwear owned by the participant, to specialised models manufactured as part of the flourishing sporting goods industry. The internationalisation of the mass market for football boots is here explored though the distinct but related case studies of two family firms; Manfield from Northamptonshire, England and Adidas from Herzogenaurach, Germany. Arguing that there was much continuity between the designs and manufacturing processes of the two firms, the article explores how the {{design of the}} football boot became increasingly influenced by the fashion industry as items of conspicuous consumption. By 1954 the launch of the training shoe saw sportswear become a style trend worn on the street, rather than on the pitch. This in turn, influenced football boot design as both a highly <b>technical</b> <b>item</b> of elite sportswear and an expensive, aspirational essential in an everyday kitbag...|$|R
