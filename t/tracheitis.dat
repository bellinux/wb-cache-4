5|$|Croup is {{typically}} diagnosed based on signs and symptoms. The {{first step is}} to exclude other obstructive conditions of the upper airway, especially epiglottitis, an airway foreign body, subglottic stenosis, angioedema, retropharyngeal abscess, and bacterial <b>tracheitis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Croup {{is usually}} {{deemed to be}} due to a viral infection. Others use the term more broadly, to include acute laryngotracheitis, spasmodic croup, {{laryngeal}} diphtheria, bacterial <b>tracheitis,</b> laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. The first two conditions involve a viral infection and are generally milder with respect to symptomatology; the last four are due to bacterial infection and are usually of greater severity.|$|E
5|$|Emus {{can suffer}} from both {{external}} and internal parasites, but under farmed conditions are more parasite-free than ostriches or rheas. External parasites include the louse Dahlemhornia asymmetrica and various other lice, ticks, mites and flies. Chicks sometimes suffer from intestinal tract infections caused by coccidian protozoa, and the nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis infects the emu {{as well as a}} wide range of other birds, causing haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Other nematodes are found in the trachea and bronchi; Syngamus trachea causing haemorrhagic <b>tracheitis</b> and Cyathostoma variegatum causing serious respiratory problems in juveniles.|$|E
5|$|Seeking {{to double}} his $7,000 salary from the {{previous}} season, Henderson became embroiled in a contract dispute with the Red Wings prior to the 1966–67 NHL season, before the team acceded to his demands. He then spent the year attempting to overcome injuries; a case of <b>tracheitis</b> forced him to miss several early season games and led the team to consider having him play wearing a surgical mask {{to protect against the}} cold air of the arena. Henderson eventually spent time in the dry air of Arizona to cure the ailment, but he also suffered from torn chest muscles and ultimately missed a third of the season. On the ice, Henderson scored 21 goals and 40 points in 49 games.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation of the trachea {{is known}} as <b>tracheitis.</b> When the trachea is {{inflamed}} {{as well as the}} larynx and bronchi, this {{is known as}} croup, which often causes a distinct, barking cough.|$|E
25|$|SeV induces lesions {{within the}} {{respiratory}} tract, {{usually associated with}} bacterial inflammation of the trachea and lung (<b>tracheitis</b> and bronchopneumonia, respectively). However, the lesions are limited, and aren't indicative solely of SeV infection. Detection, therefore, makes use of SeV-specific antigens in several serological methods, including ELISA, immunofluorescence, and hemagglutination assays, with particular emphasis on use of the ELISA for its high sensitivity (unlike the hemagglutination assay) and its fairly early detection (unlike the immunofluorescence assay).|$|E
25|$|The Bison Range Ride and Roundup - {{held every}} autumn attracts {{tourists}} {{from around the}} United States and the World. Bison are herded from {{the southern end of}} the island to holding pens on the northern end of the island. There the bison are vaccinated for parasites, infectious bovine rhino <b>tracheitis,</b> clostridium and bovine vibriosis. DNA and blood samples are taken. The bison are tagged with microchips and weighed and measured. The female bison are also vaccinated for brucellosis and checked for pregnancy. With the goal of keeping the herd at a manageable level the excess bison, about 150 - 200 head, are auctioned off in an annual sale that nets about $120,000 for the park.|$|E
25|$|Respiratory {{damage is}} related to the {{concentration}} of the gas and its solubility. Irritant gas exposures predominantly affect the airways, causing <b>tracheitis,</b> bronchitis, and bronchiolitis. Other inhaled agents may be directly toxic (e.g. cyanide, carbon monoxide), or cause harm simply by displacing oxygen and producing asphyxia (e.g. methane, carbon dioxide). The effect of inhaling irritant gases depends on the extent and duration of exposure and on the specific agent Chlorine, phosgene, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and ammonia are among the most important irritant gases. Hydrogen sulfide is also a potent cellular toxin, blocking the cytochrome system and inhibiting cellular respiration. More water-soluble gases (e.g. chlorine, ammonia, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride) dissolve in the upper airway and immediately cause mucous membrane irritation, which may alert people to the need to escape the exposure. Permanent damage to the upper respiratory tract, distal airways, and lung parenchyma occurs only if escape from the gas source is impeded. Less soluble gases (e.g. nitrogen dioxide, phosgene, ozone) may not dissolve until they are well into the respiratory tract, often reaching the lower airways. These agents are less likely to produce early warning signs (phosgene in low concentrations has a pleasant odor), are more likely to cause severe bronchiolitis, and often have a lag of ≥ 12 h before symptoms of pulmonary edema develop.|$|E
500|$|Bacterial croup may {{be divided}} into {{laryngeal}} diphtheria, bacterial <b>tracheitis,</b> laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. [...] Laryngeal diphtheria is due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae while bacterial <b>tracheitis,</b> laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis are usually due to a primary viral infection with secondary bacterial growth. [...] The most common bacteria implicated are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.|$|E
500|$|Viral croup {{is usually}} a {{self-limiting}} disease, with half of cases resolving in a day and 80% of cases in two days.

Other uncommon complications include bacterial <b>tracheitis,</b> pneumonia, and pulmonary edema.|$|E

50|$|Most {{cases of}} Capillaria aerophila {{infestation}} in {{dogs and cats}} are without serious clinical symptoms. Heavy infestations may result in inflammation of the respiratory tract (rhinitis, <b>tracheitis</b> or bronchitis), or secondary bacterial infections of the respiratory tract, including bronchopneumonia.

50|$|One of {{the most}} common causes is Staphylococcus aureus and often follows a recent viral upper {{respiratory}} infection. Bacterial <b>tracheitis</b> is a rare complication of influenza infection. It is the most serious in young children, possibly because of the relatively small size of the trachea that gets easily blocked by swelling. The most frequent sign is the rapid development of stridor. It is occasionally confused with croup.If it is inflamed, a condition known as <b>tracheitis</b> can occur. In this condition there can be inflammation of the linings of the trachea. A condition called tracheo-bronchitis can be caused, when the mucous membrane of the trachea and bronchi swell. A collapsed trachea is formed as a result of defect in the cartilage, that makes the cartilage unable to support the trachea and results in dry hacking cough. In this condition there can be inflammation of the linings of the trachea. If the connective nerve tissues in the trachea degenerate it causes tracheomalacia. Infections to the trachea can cause tracheomegaly.|$|E

50|$|Causes {{of upper}} airway {{obstruction}} include foreign body aspiration, blunt laryngotracheal trauma, penetrating laryngotracheal trauma, tonsillar hypertrophy, paralysis of the vocal cord or vocal fold, acute laryngotracheitis such as viral croup, bacterial <b>tracheitis,</b> epiglottitis, peritonsillar abscess, pertussis, retropharyngeal abscess, spasmodic croup.

50|$|The {{parasitic}} phase involves substantial {{migration in}} the definitive host {{to reach the}} predilection site. Young birds are most severely affected with migration of larvae and adults through the lungs causing a severe pneumonia. Lymphoid nodules form {{at the point of}} attachment of the worms in the bronchi and trachea. Adult worms also appear to feed on blood. Worms in the bronchi and trachea provoke a hemorrhagic <b>tracheitis</b> and bronchitis, forming large quantities of mucus, plugging the air passages and, in severe cases, causing asphyxiation.|$|E
