5|$|Faced {{with growing}} {{legal and illegal}} {{competition}} for the globally marketed ASA, Bayer worked to cement the connection between Bayer and Aspirin. One strategy it developed was to switch from distributing Aspirin powder for pharmacists to press into pill form to distributing standardized tablets—complete with the distinctive Bayer cross logo. In 1903 the company set up an American subsidiary, with a converted factory in Rensselaer, New York, to produce Aspirin for the American market without paying import duties. Bayer also sued <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> patent violators and smugglers. The company's attempts to hold onto its Aspirin sales incited criticism from muckraking journalists and the American Medical Association, especially after the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act that prevented trademarked drugs from being listed in the United States Pharmacopeia; Bayer listed ASA with an intentionally convoluted generic name (monoacetic acid ester of salicylic acid) to discourage doctors referring to anything but Aspirin.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> episode {{during the}} Red Summer was a vicious attack on blacks in Elaine, Arkansas, in which nearly 200 blacks were murdered. Reports {{coming out of}} the South blamed the blacks, alleging that they were conspiring to take over the government. Infuriated with the distortions, Du Bois {{published}} a letter in the New York World, claiming that the only crime the black sharecroppers had committed was daring to challenge their white landlords by hiring an attorney to investigate contractual irregularities.The sharecroppers were working with the Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America. Over 60 of the surviving blacks were arrested and tried for conspiracy, in the case known as Moore v. Dempsey. Du Bois rallied blacks across America to raise funds for the legal defense, which, six years later, resulted in a Supreme Court victory authored by Oliver Wendell Holmes. Although the victory had little immediate impact on justice for blacks in the South, it marked the first time the Federal government used the 14th amendment guarantee of due process to prevent states from shielding mob violence.|$|E

Accordingly, he persuaded both the men from Piraeus and the government in Athens to send emissaries to Sparta. These returned along with 15 officials empowered to work with Pausanias to negotiate a settlement to the issue. Pausanias then persuaded the Athenians to settle their disagreement on the terms of all being permitted {{to return to their}} homes except for the Thirty and their most prominent collaborators, while all who feared for their safety were free to remove to Eleusis. Democracy was reestablished, and all but <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> offenders were pardoned.

25|$|UNAMSIL forces began {{arriving}} in Sierra Leone in December 1999. At {{that time the}} maximum number of troops to be deployed was set at 6,000. Only a few months later, though, in February 2000, a new UN resolution authorized the deployment of 11,000 combatants. In March 2001 that number was increased to 17,500 troops, making it at the time the largest UN force in existence, and UNAMSIL soldiers were deployed in the RUF-held diamond areas. Despite these numbers, UNAMSIL was frequently rebuffed and humiliated by RUF rebels, being subjected to attacks, obstruction and disarmament. In <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> example, in May 2000 over 500 UNAMSIL peacekeepers were captured by the RUF and held hostage. Using the weapons and armored personnel carriers of the captured UNAMSIL troops, the rebels advanced towards Freetown, taking over the town of Lunsar to its northeast. For over a year later, the UNAMSIL force meticulously avoided intervening in RUF controlled mining districts lest another major incident occur. After the UNAMSIL force had essentially rearmed the RUF, a call for a new military intervention was made to save the UNAMSIL hostages and the government of Sierra Leone. After Operation Palliser and Operation Khukri the situation stabilized and UNAMSIL gain control.|$|E

500|$|The game's stylistic {{changes from}} past Final Fantasy titles sparked {{negative}} comments, with some perceiving it as {{a change in}} the spirit of the franchise. Among these were the game's status as Final Fantasys first direct sequel and the change from a tragic atmosphere in Final Fantasy X to a dominantly lighthearted tone in Final Fantasy X-2. In their review, gaming website GameSpot commented that [...] "Some of the missions ... come off as downright silly and a bit tacked on". Additionally, they felt that the game's non-linear style makes it [...] " [...] the singular narrative thrust of Final Fantasy X or other typical RPGs, and the storyline can feel a little nebulous and disjointed as a result". Moreover, GameSpot commented that [...] "trivial minigames have been creeping into the Final Fantasy games at an alarming rate over the last few years, and in this regard, X-2 is definitely <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> offender in the series". Despite these comments, they praised the battle system as a [...] "welcome addition", while regarding its voice-overs and localizations as [...] "outstanding".|$|E
500|$|As <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> offence an {{individual}} could commit, viewed {{as seriously as}} though the accused had personally attacked the monarch, high treason demanded the ultimate punishment. [...] But whereas men guilty of this crime were hanged, drawn and quartered, women were drawn and burned. [...] In his Commentaries on the Laws of England the 18th-century English jurist William Blackstone noted that the sentence, [...] "to be drawn to the gallows, and there to be burned alive", was [...] "full as terrible to the sensation as the other". [...] Blackstone wrote that women were burned rather than quartered as [...] "the decency due to the sex forbids the exposing and publicly mangling their bodies". [...] However, an observation by historian Jules Michelet, that [...] "the first flame to rise consumed the clothes, revealing poor trembling nakedness", may, {{in the opinion of}} historian Vic Gatrell, suggest that this solution is [...] "misconceived".

500|$|Swiss {{cities and}} railway lines were {{repeatedly}} bombed by Allied aircraft during the war, beginning with minor attacks by the Royal Air Force on Geneva, Basel, and Zürich in 1940.

In reaction to comments by Swiss Foreign Minister Marcel Pilet-Golaz that the incident [...] "apparently was a deliberate attack", American apologies were undermined by ill-advised statements made by Air Force commanders in London which blamed weather and minimized the size and accuracy of the attack. Although an in-depth investigation showed that weather in France, particularly winds that nearly doubled the ground speed of the U.S. bombers, did in fact cause the wing to mistake Schaffhausen for its target at Ludwigshafen am Rhein, the Swiss were not mollified. Incidents escalated, resulting in 13 separate attacks on Swiss territory on 22February 1945—the day President Franklin D. Roosevelt's special assistant, Lauchlin Currie, went to Schaffhausen to lay a wreath on the graves of those killed a year earlierand simultaneous attacks 4March that dropped 29tons of high explosives and 17tons of incendiaries on Basel and Zürich.|$|E
500|$|The {{downside}} of demobilization was that around 70,000 military personnel were left unemployed. That meant {{little to the}} conscripts, and most returned home, but the career military personnel saw their livelihoods taken away, and houses, land, and money which was promised to them was either not delivered due to inadequate resources or seemed to be paid arbitrarily. Since only 5.8% of the former officers had received benefits by early 1992, {{there was a feeling}} that those who had political favor had either kept their jobs in the 14% of the military which was retained or received their promised compensation. Between April and December 1992, a series of strikes were held in protest of the situation. Pockets of army veterans ("recompas") and resistance veterans ("recontras") threatened to re-arm, but realizing they had the same issues, the two sides joined forces. To pacify the groups, Chamorro integrated some of the former Contra fighters into the rural police services and established a Civil Inspectorate to investigate claims of police abuses and human rights violations. [...] She also allowed the Sandinistas' agrarian reform movement's redistribution of land to be maintained and expanded it on the Caribbean coast to meet veterans' demands. That move created conflict with the Caribbean indigenous people and infringed on forestry reserves leading to criticism. Others who had received land from the Sandinistas began to return their co-operative land titles to the large landholders who had owned them before the reforms, or simply to sell their portions to opportunists. Unable to solve the problem, Chamorro dealt with <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> claims and then turned the issue over to the courts to resolve individual disputes.|$|E
500|$|High treason was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>egregious</b> offence an {{individual}} could commit. [...] Attempts {{to undermine the}} king's authority were viewed with as much seriousness as if the accused had attacked him personally, which itself would be an assault on his status as sovereign and {{a direct threat to}} his right to govern. [...] As this might undermine the state, retribution was considered an absolute necessity and the crime deserving of the ultimate punishment. [...] The practical difference between the two offences therefore was in the consequence of being convicted; rather than being drawn and hanged, men were to be hanged, drawn and quartered, while for reasons of public decency (their anatomy being considered inappropriate for the sentence), women were instead drawn and burned. [...] The Act declared that a person had committed high treason if they were: compassing or imagining the death of the king, his wife or his eldest son and heir; violating the king's wife, his eldest daughter if she were unmarried, or the wife of his eldest son and heir; levying war against the king in his realm; adhering to the king's enemies in his realm, giving them aid and comfort in his realm or elsewhere; counterfeiting the Great Seal or the Privy Seal, or the king's coinage; knowingly importing counterfeit money; killing the Chancellor, Treasurer or one of the king's Justices while performing their offices. [...] The Act did not limit the king's authority in defining the scope of treason. [...] It contained a proviso giving English judges discretion to extend that scope whenever required, a process more commonly known as constructive treason. [...] It also applied to subjects overseas in British colonies in the Americas, but the only documented incident of {{an individual}} there being hanged, drawn and quartered was that of Joshua Tefft, an English colonist accused of having fought {{on the side of the}} Narragansett during the Great Swamp Fight. [...] He was executed in January 1676. [...] Later sentences resulted either in a pardon or a hanging.|$|E
