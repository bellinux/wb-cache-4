6000|$|... "It's true enough. But <b>thats</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> mischief. Douglas: I {{tell you}} she's the cleverest woman in London. She can do {{anything}} she likes. She can manage a conversation with any foreigner in his own language, whether she knows it or not. She gabbles Italian like a native. She can learn off her part in a new piece, music and all, between breakfast and luncheon, any day. She can cook: she can make a new bonnet out of the lining of an old coat: she can drive a bargain with a Jew. She says she never learns a thing at all unless she can learn it in ten minutes. She can fence, and shoot. She can dance anything in the world. I never knew such a mimic as she is. If you saw her take off the Bones at the Christy Minstrels, you'd say she was the lowest of the low. Next minute she will give herself the airs of a duchess, or do the ingenuous in a style that would make Conny burst with envy. To see her preaching like George would make you laugh for a week. There's nothing she couldnt do if she chose. And now, {{what do you think}} she has taken to? Liquor. Champagne by the gallon. She used to drink it by the bottle: now she drinks it by the dozen--by the case. She wanted it to keep up her spirits. That was the way it began. If she felt down, a glass of champagne would set her up. Then she was always feeling down, and always setting herself up. At last feeling down came to mean the same thing as being sober. You dont know what a drunken woman is, Douglas, unless youve lived in the same house with one." [...] Douglas recoiled, and looked very sternly at Marmaduke, who proceeded more vehemently. [...] "She's nothing but a downright beast. She's either screaming at you in a fit of rage, or clawing at you in a fit of fondness that makes you sick. When she falls asleep, there she is, a besotted heap tumbled anyhow into bed, snoring and grunting like a pig. When she wakes, she begins planning how to get more liquor. Think of what you or I would feel if we saw our mothers tipsy. By God, that child of mine wouldnt believe its eyes if it saw its mother sober. Only for Lucy, I'd have pitched her over long ago. I did all I could when I first saw that she was overdoing the champagne. I swore I'd break the neck of any man I caught bringing wine into the house. I sacked the whole staff of servants twice because I found a lot of fresh corks swept into the dustpan. I stopped drinking at home myself: I got in doctors to frighten her: I tried bribing, coaxing, threatening: I knocked her down once when I caught her with a bottle in her hand; and she fell with her head against the fender, and frightened me a good deal more than she hurt herself. It was no use. Sometimes she used to defy me, and say she would drink, she didnt care whether she was killing herself or not. Other times she cried; implored me to save her from destroying herself; asked me why I didnt thrash the life out of her whenever I caught her drunk; promised on her oath never to touch another drop. The same evening she would be drunk again, and, when I taxed her with it, say that she wasn't drunk, that she was sick, and that she prayed the Almighty on her knees to strike her dead if she had a bottle in the house. Aye, and the very stool she knelt on would be a wine case with a red cloth stuck to it with a few gilt-headed nails {{to make it look like}} a piece of furniture. Next day she would laugh at me for believing her, and ask me what use I supposed there was in talking to her. How she managed to hold on at the theatre, I dont know. She wouldnt learn new parts, and stuck to old ones that she could do in her sleep, she knew them so well. She would go on the stage and get through a long part when she couldnt walk straight from the wing to her dressing-room. Of course, her voice went to the dogs long ago; but by dint of screeching and croaking she pulls through. She says she darent go on sober now; that she knows she should break down. The theatre has fallen off, too. The actors got out of the place one by one--they didnt like playing with her--and were replaced by a third-rate lot. The audiences used to be very decent: now they are all cads and fast women. The game is up for her in London. She has been offered an engagement in America on the strength of her old reputation; but what is the use of it if she continues drinking." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Frighteners was {{released}} in the United States in 1,675 theaters, and opened at #5, earning $5,565,495 during its opening weekend, averaging $3,335 per theater. The film eventually grossed a worldwide total of $29,359,216. The Frighteners ended up being a box office disappointment, mostly due to competition from Independence Day; in interviews conducted years after The Frighteners release, Jackson commented he was disappointed by Universals ubiquitous marketing campaign, including a poster which [...] "didnt tell you anything about the picture", which he believed was the primary reason the film was not a financial success. Additionally, the film opened {{on the same day}} the Atlanta Summer Olympics began; when Jackson realized this and told the studio, they answered [...] "We dont think so; our research indicates <b>thats</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case...

The Series, which lasted from 1969 to 1989 contained English translations of important historical documents from the Regmi Research Collection and short historical analyses - often drafts of narratives that later appeared elsewhere - written by Regmi himself. It also contained short articles written by others, often translated from their original Nepali into English. This periodical was of interest mainly to serious researchers of Nepali society. In the 1992 interview by Gaenszle, Regmi justified his decision to discontinue the Series in December 1989: [...] "Well, the first thing was that it was selling only about forty copies, forty subscriptions. It did not generate enough resources to hire people, assistants, things like that. That was the main problem. Another problem was that I couldnt find anyone with the competence to translate the old documents in the style I used. So it was a one-man show."

40|$|O presente trabalho de pesquisa {{consiste}} em enveredar na an?lise da m?sica popularmente designada como brega, que ora se caracteriza como um estilo musical predominante na regi?o norte. Buscamos historicizar e refletir acerca das m?ltiplas interpreta??es a respeito das rela??es afetivas contidas nesta arte sonora, levando-se em conta o cotidiano daqueles que vivenciam esse tipo de m?sica. Esta pesquisa visa tematizar hist?rias que se desenrolam nos bares, nas pequenas e grandes casas noturnas, no in?cio ou fim de noite, nos bairros perif?ricos e nobres, enfim, em variadas matizes que ultrapassam o simples gosto de se ouvir ou dan?ar o brega, tendo como pano de fundo as rela??es sentimentais de homens e mulheres. O recorte temporal trabalhado ser? as d?cadas de 1980 e 1990, indicado pelo aparecimento de v?rios cantores, CDs, pedidos de ouvintes nas r?dios, shows e entrevistas em jornais de grande porte. Entretanto, quando necess?rio, n?o haver? impedimentos para recuos temporais, pois a m?sica brega ? constru?da como deriva??o de m?sicas dos anos 60 e 70, como por exemplo, o rock de Elves Presley, ou cantores da jovem guarda, como Roberto Carlos, Erasmo Carlos, Vanderl?ia. Na abordagem do tema, percebemos o quanto as can??es e a bebida alco?lica s?o fatores de motiva??o para que pessoas se encontrem, conversem, bebam e contem todas as suas est?rias. Entendemos que essa tem?tica poderia se desdobrar para o estudo de v?rios temas, como: musicalidade, g?nero, hist?ria, sexualidade, cultura e festa. N?o queremos fazer aqui a hist?ria da m?sica brega, n?o ? essa a inten??o. Queremos explorar outras possibilidades que a m?sica nos d?, analisar como os sujeitos vivenciam e interagem no seu cotidiano com esse tipo de m?sica, ver como essa m?sica denominada como brega tamb?m tem algo a transmitir, tem uma historicidade. A m?sica brega capta influ?ncias trazidas n?o s? por seus fi?is seguidores, mas envolve uma gama de elementos culturalmente constru?dos por toda a sociedade. A mulher, como tema principal dessas narrativas musicais, torna-se foco de sentimentos contradit?rios nas letras dessas m?sicas. O amor e o ?dio, por exemplo, s?o sentimentos pr?ximos, t?nues, que na m?sica brega s?o passados de maneira crua, sem muitos subterf?gios. Al?m das letras de m?sicas, constituem tamb?m fontes de investiga??o, material iconogr?fico, bibliogr?fico e depoimentos orais. Neste ?ltimo caso, buscou-se dialogar diretamente com os sujeitos do estudo, homens e mulheres que atrav?s de um estilo musical, tecem seus sentimentos. The {{current research}} work consists of leading {{in the analysis}} of music popularly designated as brega that characterizes itself as predominant musical style in the north area. We search to report historically and to contemplate concerning the multiple interpretations regarding the affective relationships contained in this sound art, taking into account the everyday life of those who live that type of music. This research seeks to give themes to histories that take place at bars, at small and big night clubs, at the beginning or end of night, in the outlying and noble neighborhoods, finally in varied shades that surpass the simple taste of hearing or dancing the tacky rhythm, tending as backdrop men and women?s relationships. The temporary cutting worked will be decades between 1980 and 1990, suitable for the several singer?s emergence, cd, requests of listeners on the radios, shows and interviews for newspapers of great load. However, when needed, there won?t be obstructions for temporary retreats, since the brega music is built as a derivation of music of the 60 ?s and 70 ?s, as Elvis Presley?s rock or the youth?s singers movement in Brazil like Roberto Carlos, Erasmo Carlos and Vanderleia for instance. In the approach of the theme, we noticed how much the songs and the alcoholic drink are motivation factors for people meet themselves, drink and tell themselves all their stories. We understand that this thematic itself could be unfolded for the study of several themes, such as: musicality, gender, history, sexuality, culture and party. We don?t want to do the History of the brega music here, <b>that?s</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> intention. We want to explore other possibilities that music gives us to analyse how the subjects live and how they interact with that kind of music, to see how that music known as tacky has also something to transmit, it has history. The brega music captures influences brought not only for its faithful followers, but it involves a range of elements culturally built by the whole society. The woman, as the main theme of those musical narratives, becomes the focus of contradictory feelings in the lyrics of those songs. Love and hate, for instance, are close, fine feelings that in the brega music are passed in a hard way, without many subterfuges. Besides the lyrics of the music, they also constitute investigation sources, iconographical, bibliographical material and oral statements. In this last case, it was searched to talk directly with the subject of the study, men and women that weave their feelings through a musical style...|$|E
