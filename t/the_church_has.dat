5|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> a nave with a north {{aisle and}} vestry, a Perpendicular Gothic west tower, a chancel and a south porch. The nave was rebuilt {{in the late}} 15th or early 16th century to meet a tower of {{approximately}} the same age; it is often dated to 1521, but appears to be built on older foundations. The southern side of the nave contains what are probably thirteenth-century buttresses {{and a pair of}} Perpendicular Gothic windows. The north aisle was originally built in the 13th century, and rebuilt by H.J. Underwood in 1890; the vestry was built in the 17th century and rebuilt in 1846 to designs by Chamberlain, through the generosity of the curate, Alexander Penrose Forbes. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> been reroofed at least twice, in 1825 and 1897.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> {{a single}} {{elongated}} nave. It is surmounted by a dome and finishes {{with a single}} apse in its eastern part. The dome is supported by arches {{to the north and}} south and vaults to the west and east. The apse is five-sided on the outside and round on the inside. To the west of it is the sanctuary which features three vaults which hosted the bema, the prothesis and the diaconicon. The sanctuary was separated {{from the rest of the}} nave via two pillars. Three buttresses support the south wall and the apse.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Church</b> of Scientology of Moscow {{subsequently}} applied eleven {{times for}} re-registration to the Moscow Justice Department between August 1998 and May 2005. Each application was rejected. The first two applications were refused {{on the grounds}} that <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>had</b> violated unspecified laws. The third to fifth applications were refused {{on the grounds that}} <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>had</b> failed to submit unspecified documents. The sixth to tenth applications were refused on the grounds that <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>had</b> failed to comply with the time limit for re-registration, although the Constitutional Court had already held that this reason was not valid. Finally, the eleventh application was refused on the ground that <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>had</b> failed to prove its existence in Moscow for at least 15 years, although the Constitutional Court had already held that this reason was not valid.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> been {{protected}} as {{a national}} antiquity since 1940; in 1970, it was enlisted among Bulgaria's monuments of culture of national importance. The church was reconstructed in the 2000s by a team under architect Stoycho Maronov. The restoration efforts restored the windows, the interior frescoes and the iconostasis, and took 42 days.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> {{not been}} {{conclusively}} dated. Art historian André Grabar {{placed it in}} the 14th century, scholar Nikola Mavrodinov dated it to the 13th century, while archaeologist Krastyu Miyatev is {{of the opinion that}} both theories are equally likely. Architecture writer Stefan Stamov gives a possible range from the 12th to the 14th century.|$|E
50|$|The {{surroundings}} of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>have</b> changed drastically {{from the}} original neighborhood.

5|$|According {{to another}} legend, {{there was once}} a sea where the Dnieper River now flows. When Saint Andrew came to Kiev and erected a cross on the place where the Saint Andrew's Church now stands, the sea went away. The only part that {{remained}} of the sea is under the mountain on which Kiev sits today. When the church was built there in the 18th century, a spring opened under the altar. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> no bells, because, according to the legend, when the first bell strikes, the water can revive again and flood the left bank of Kiev.|$|E
5|$|As the Tsaress {{planned to}} take {{personal}} care of the church, <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> no parish, {{and there is no}} belltower to call the congregation to divine service. But she died before the construction ended, so the church was never cared for by Elizabeth Petrovna. After Elizabeth's death, the Kiev court took no interest maintaining in the church, last consecrated in 1767. Later, there were not enough funds to maintain the church, which left the maintaining of the church to private and voluntary funds, such as Andrey Muraviov.|$|E
5|$|As the United Press International {{news agency}} noted, Church of Scientology biographies of Hubbard's life do not mention either {{of his first}} two wives. In one {{publication}} <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>has</b> airbrushed Northrup out of {{a photograph of the}} couple that appeared in the Miami Daily News issue of June 30, 1946.

It {{is said to}} have 13th-century origins, but there has been much {{rebuilding}} (especially in the 19th century) and the oldest part remaining is the south wall of the nave, which is believed to be 14thcentury. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> a 15th-century tower (rebuilt in 1804) which originally contained four bells cast in 1724.

5|$|In 1963, Rastrelli's {{original}} {{plans for}} the building were found in Vienna, Austria. This {{made it possible to}} reconstruct the original images on the building. The plan of restoration was carried out in the 1970s, overlooked by the main architect-restorer, V. Korneyeva. Since 1968, <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> been opened as a museum to tourists and visitors. The church is now owned by the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church.|$|E
