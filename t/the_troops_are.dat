25|$|But, as is {{told in the}} Rotensian Chronicle (the {{chronicle of}} Alfonso III of Asturias in which Pelayo is {{considered}} the successor of the kings of Toledo, with clear goals of political legitimacy) {{as well as in}} that of Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari (a Maghrebi historian of the 16th century who died in Cairo, Egypt, and who could have used the Rotensian Chronicle and rewritten it eight centuries later, making it useless as a historical document), Pelayo escaped from Cordoba during the governorship of al-Hurr (717-718) and his return to Asturias triggered a revolt against the Muslim authorities of Gijón. The identity of Pelayo, however, is still an open subject, and that {{is only one of the}} theories. The leader of the Astures, whose origin is debated by historians, had at that time his home in Bres (in the district of Piloña) and Munuza sent his troops there under al-Qama. After receiving word of the arrival of the Muslims, Pelayo and his companions hurriedly crossed the Piloña and headed toward the narrow, easily defended valley of Auseva mountain, and took refuge in one of its caves, Covadonga. After an attempt at siege was abandoned due to the weather and the exposed position of the deep valley gorge, <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>are</b> said to have taken to exit through the high ports to the south, in order to continue in the search and destroy action against other rebels. There the locals were able to ambush the Muslim detachment, which was annihilated. The rest of its survivors continued south to the plains of Leon, leaving the maritime districts of Asturias exposed and weakened of defenders.|$|E

He claimed that the Strategic Hamlet Program was a shambles in the delta, stating that they were [...] "being chewed to pieces by the Viet Cong". When it was noted that Phillips had recently witnessed a battle in the delta, Kennedy asked Phillips for his assessment. Phillips replied: [...] "Well, I don't like to contradict General Krulak, but I have to tell you, Mr. President, that we're not winning the war, particularly in the delta. <b>The</b> <b>troops</b> <b>are</b> paralysed, they're in the barracks, and this is what is actually going on in one province that's right next to Saigon." [...] Phillips asserted that removing Nhu {{was the only way to}} improve the situation. Phillips asserted that the only means of removing Nhu was to bring in Colonel Edward Lansdale, the CIA operative who had consolidated Diệm's position a decade earlier, a proposal that Kennedy dismissed.

Afterwards a smaller meeting of Lloyd George, Bonar Law, Curzon and Hankey {{was called to}} discuss, in Hankey's words, “the desirability {{of getting rid of}} Haig”. Lloyd George wanted to accept his resignation, but Henry Wilson, who thought there was no [...] "really outstanding personality" [...] for the job, suggested waiting for Haig’s report on the March retreat before making a decision. Although opinion was [...] "unanimously agst Haig" [...] the other ministers thought there was no obvious successor (Hankey thought the only possibility was Plumer “in whom <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>are</b> said to have confidence” but who was [...] "as stupid as Haig himself”). Haig no longer enjoyed the support in Parliament of a few weeks earlier. Rumours were rife in GHQ that Haig would soon be dismissed in favour of Robertson, Wilson (who may have been a prime mover for Haig's dismissal), or more likely Plumer, Byng or Allenby.|$|E
2500|$|On Jan. 8, 1942 50th Army {{launched}} {{the second phase}} of the Moscow counteroffensive with a surprise attack on German positions southeast of Tula. On the 18th, Boldin introduced an army mobile group to the battle, which tore through the sagging German defenses and liberated the city of Kaluga. Boldin received much credit for this, which he shared with other commanders and the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps which led the group. Following this, the 50th pressed westward as part of the Rzhev-Vyasma Offensive, making repeated and increasingly futile efforts to cut the Smolensk – Moscow highway and encircle Army Group Center. As the army weakened through attrition and the German forces regained their balance, Boldin showed his frustration in numerous after-action reports. On Apr. 22 he reported angrily to his superiors that he was being slowed down by lack of ammunition, due to poor road conditions for wheeled transport: [...] "As an extreme measure, in some units <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>are</b> carrying supplies by hand." [...] He was also driven to distraction by the total lack of air support. In these conditions the offensive ground to a halt.|$|E
2500|$|The Wu Li (吳歷) {{provided}} a different {{account of how}} Taishi Ci came to serve Sun Ce. It mentioned that Taishi Ci was defeated and captured by Sun Ce after their fight at Shen Village. Sun Ce had heard of Taishi Ci before so he released Taishi Ci from his bonds and asked him for advice on his future conquests. Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I am an officer of a defeated army. I am not qualified to speak on such matters." [...] Sun Ce said, [...] "In the past, Han Xin heeded advice from Guangwu. In the present, I seek advice from a man of righteousness. What are you talking about?" [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "My army has recently been defeated. <b>The</b> <b>troops</b> <b>are</b> scattered and low on morale. It may be difficult, but I still intend to gather and bring them together. I am afraid {{this is not what}} you wish to see." [...] Sun Ce knelt down and said, [...] "What I want is your sincerity. I hope you will return by midday tomorrow." [...] When Sun Ce's subordinates raised doubts about Taishi Ci's loyalty, Sun Ce said, [...] "Taishi Ziyi is a famous man from Qing Province. He is known for keeping his promises. I believe he will not deceive me." [...] The following day, Sun Ce hosted a banquet and had a pole erected in the middle, so as to keep track of time by observing its shadow. By midday, when the shadow was shortest, Taishi Ci returned as promised. Sun Ce was overjoyed. He often consulted Taishi Ci on military affairs later on.|$|E
