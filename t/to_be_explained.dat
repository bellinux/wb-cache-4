5|$|In the 1970s, Vera Rubin {{uncovered}} a discrepancy between observed galactic rotation speed and that {{predicted by the}} visible mass of stars and gas. Today, the galaxy rotation problem is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> {{by the presence of}} large quantities of unseen dark matter. A concept known as the universal rotation curve of spirals, moreover, shows that the problem is ubiquitous in these objects.|$|E
5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific explanation is the deductive-nomological model. It {{says that a}} successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a scientific law. This view {{has been subjected to}} substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize what is meant by an explanation when the thing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> cannot be deduced from any law because {{it is a matter of}} chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained.</b> Others have argued that the key to a good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.|$|E

5|$|All {{episodes of}} the first season were written by Sam Egan and Kindler; Kindler hired Egan to assist in writing the first season, as he {{believed}} Egan to be creative, passionate, and talented. Several episodes {{of the first}} season were written throughout the Christmas season in 2007. After the series was given the green-light, they were rewritten to establish a season-long storyline. Some of the episodes finished their writing stage as little as {{two and a half}} weeks before filming commenced. At times after the scripts were written, Sci Fi executive Mark Stern fed back to the writers, asking for certain elements <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> so the audience could understand.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{discovery}} of many hundreds of Iron Age sites in Scotland {{there is still a}} great deal that remains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> {{about the nature of the}} Celtic life in the early Christian era. Unfortunately radiocarbon dating for this period is problematic and chronological sequences are poorly understood. For a variety of reasons much of the archaeological work to date in Scotland has concentrated on the islands of the west and north and both excavations and analysis of societal structures on the mainland are more limited in scope.|$|E
5|$|During the flyby of July 14, 2005, the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) found a warm region {{near the}} south pole. Temperatures {{in this region}} ranged from 85–90 K, with small areas showing as high as , much too warm <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by solar heating, {{indicating}} that parts of the south polar region are heated from the interior of Enceladus. The presence of a subsurface ocean under the south polar region is now accepted, but it cannot explain {{the source of the}} heat, with an estimated heat flux of 200mW/m2, which is about 10 times higher than that from radiogenic heating alone.|$|E

5|$|Exposure to {{conversations and}} {{engaging}} in conversation with others help school-age children develop vocabulary. Fast mapping {{is the process of}} learning a new concept upon a single exposure and is used in word learning not only by infants and toddlers, but by preschool children and adults as well. This principle is very useful for word learning in conversational settings, as words tend not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> explicitly in conversation, but may be referred to frequently throughout the span of a conversation.|$|E
5|$|Further complicating {{this picture}} are {{repetition}} patterns. There {{are two types}} of repetition in Rapanui words: double syllables within roots, as in mamari, and grammatical reduplication of disyllables, as seen in rongorongo. In the Rapanui lexicon, double syllables as in mamari are 50% more likely than chance can explain. However, in the rongorongo texts, analogous double AA glyphs are only 8% more likely than chance. Similarly, in the Rapanui lexicon reduplicated disyllables such as rongorongo are seven times as common as chance, constituting a quarter of the vocabulary, whereas, in rongorongo texts, ABAB sequences are only twice as likely as chance, and 10% of the vocabulary. If rongorongo is a phonetic script, therefore, this discrepancy needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained.</b> Pozdniakov suggests that perhaps there was a 'reduplicator' glyph, or that modifications of glyphs, such as facing heads to the left rather than to the right, may have indicated repetition.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} when the Deccan Traps {{hypothesis}} was linked to a slower extinction, Luis Alvarez (who died in 1988) replied that paleontologists were being misled by sparse data. While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept {{the idea that the}} mass extinctions {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. Even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, however, such as a drop in sea level and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions. The duration of the K-T extinction event was less than 10 ky, and the time span is too short <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by Deccan volcanism. Geophysical models and high-precision radiometric dating suggest that the Chicxulub impact could have triggered some of the largest Deccan eruptions, and potentially, could have triggered eruptions at active volcanoes anywhere on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Tired of his high-priced {{imported}} livestock {{losing in}} local shows, Glure concocts a dog {{show with a}} special gold cup event that is limited to collies that are both American Kennel Club blue ribbon winners and capable of completing the tasks of a British working sheep dog trial. Initially, {{it seems like the}} only dog who meets the requirements is Glure's recently purchased blue-merle champion, Lochinvar III; however, the Mistress is able to command Lad through the motions of the trial. Lochinvar works primarily by hand signal, so when Glure accidentally burns his fingers on his cigar while going through the trial, the dog stops working and waits for Glure's hand-shaking <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained.</b> The dog is disqualified and Lad is declared the winner. The Master and Mistress donate the gold cup to the Red Cross in his name.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Jeffrey Moore (planetary {{geologist}} of Ames Research Center) {{proposed an}} alternate view of Titan's geology. Noting that no volcanic features had been unambiguously identified on Titan so far, {{he asserted that}} Titan is a geologically dead world, whose surface is shaped only by impact cratering, fluvial and eolian erosion, mass wasting and other exogenic processes. According to this hypothesis, methane is not emitted by volcanoes but slowly diffuses out of Titan's cold and stiff interior. Ganesa Macula may be an eroded impact crater with a dark dune in the center. The mountainous ridges observed in some regions can be explained as heavily degraded scarps of large multi-ring impact structures or {{as a result of}} the global contraction due to the slow cooling of the interior. Even in this case, Titan may still have an internal ocean made of the eutectic water–ammonia mixture with a temperature of , which is low enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by the decay of radioactive elements in the core. The bright Xanadu terrain may be a degraded heavily cratered terrain similar to that observed on the surface of Callisto. Indeed, were it not for its lack of an atmosphere, Callisto could serve as a model for Titan's geology in this scenario. Jeffrey Moore even called Titan Callisto with weather.|$|E

25|$|It {{is in fact}} in Japan that we {{can trace}} the most {{remarkable}} evolution in the Pacific of an imagined Judaic past. As elsewhere in the world, the theory that aspects of the country were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> via an Israelite model was introduced by Western agents.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the main}} {{drawback}} {{of the theory}} {{turned out to be the}} result that particles are not self-interacting.
