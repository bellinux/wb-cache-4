5|$|Music of Turkey {{includes}} mainly Turkic {{elements as}} well as partial influences ranging from Central Asian folk music, Arabic music, Greek music, Ottoman music, Persian music and Balkan music, {{as well as}} references to more modern European and American popular music. The roots of traditional music in Turkey span across centuries <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the Seljuk Turks migrated to Anatolia and Persia in the 11th century and contains elements of both Turkic and pre-Turkic influences. Much of its modern popular music can trace its roots to the emergence in the early 1930s drive for Westernization.|$|E
5|$|The name first {{appears in}} Saxon {{charters}} in around AD 880 as Cantuctun and two centuries {{later in the}} Domesday Book as Cantoctona and Cantetone. The name means settlement by a rim or circle of hills; Cantuc is Celtic for a rim or circle, and -ton or -tun is Old English for a settlement. The highest point of the hills is called Will's Neck meaning ridge of the Welshman, probably referring <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the hills marked {{the boundary between the}} expanding Saxon kingdom of Wessex and the lands of the Britons or 'Welsh' to the West. A battle was fought locally at that time.|$|E
5|$|Stone brought Terry Hayes {{to write}} the {{screenplay}} entitled Return of the Apes. Set in the near future, a plague is making humans extinct. Geneticist Will Robinson discovers the plague is a genetic time bomb embedded in the Stone Age. He time travels with a pregnant colleague named Billie Rae Diamond <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> Palaeolithic humans were at war {{for the future of}} the planet with highly evolved apes. The apes' supreme commander is a gorilla named Drak. Robinson and Billie Rae discover a young human girl named Aiv (pronounced Eve) to be the next step in evolution. It is revealed that it was the apes that created the virus to destroy the human race. They protect her from the virus, thus ensuring the survival of the human race 102,000 years later. Billie Rae gives birth to a baby boy named Adam.|$|E

5|$|The {{exact nature}} of {{relations}} between Tibet and the Ming dynasty of China (1368–1644) is unclear. Analysis of the relationship is further complicated by modern political conflicts {{and the application of}} Westphalian sovereignty <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the concept did not exist. Some Mainland Chinese scholars, such as Wang Jiawei and Nyima Gyaincain, assert that the Ming dynasty had unquestioned sovereignty over Tibet, pointing to the Ming court's issuing of various titles to Tibetan leaders, Tibetans' full acceptance of these titles, and a renewal process for successors of these titles that involved traveling to the Ming capital. Scholars within China also argue that Tibet has been an integral part of China since the 13th century and that it was thus a part of the Ming Empire. But most scholars outside China, such as Turrell V. Wylie, Melvin C. Goldstein, and Helmut Hoffman, say that the relationship was one of suzerainty, that Ming titles were only nominal, that Tibet remained an independent region outside Ming control, and that it simply paid tribute until the Jiajing Emperor (1521–1566), who ceased relations with Tibet.|$|E

25|$|Old Austin is an adage {{often used}} by the native {{citizens}} in Austin, Texas when being nostalgic {{to refer to the}} olden days of the capital city of Texas. Although Austin is also known internationally as the live music capital of the world and its catch phrase/slogan Keep Austin Weird can be heard echoed in places as far as Buffalo, NY and Santa Monica, CA - the term Old Austin refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the city was smaller and more bohemian with a considerably lower cost of living and better known for its lack of traffic, hipsters, and urban sprawl. It is often employed by longtime residents expressing displeasure at the rapidly changing culture.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{surviving}} {{cultural traditions}} in Australia—and {{some of the}} oldest surviving cultural traditions on earth—are those of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Their ancestors have inhabited Australia for between 40,000 and 60,000 years, living a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. In 2006, the Indigenous population was estimated at 517,000 people, or 2.5 per cent of the total population. Most Aboriginal Australians have a belief system based on the Dreaming, or Dreamtime, which refers both <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> ancestral spirits created land and culture, and to the knowledge and practices that define individual and community responsibilities and identity. Conflict and reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians {{has been a source}} of much art and literature in Australia, and ancient Aboriginal artistic styles and iconic inventions such as the boomerang, the didgeridoo and Indigenous Australian music have become symbols of modern Australia.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{roots of}} Japanese {{calligraphy}} {{go back to}} the twenty-eighth century B.C., <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> pictographs were inscribed on bone for religious purposes. When this writing developed into an instrument of administration for the state, the need for a uniform script was felt and Li Si, prime minister in the Chinese dynasty of Qin, standardized a script and its way of being written. He sanctioned a form of script based on squares of uniform size into which all characters could be written from eight strokes. He also devised rules of composition where horizontal strokes are written first and characters are composed starting from top to bottom, left to right. Because the symbols were inscribed with sharp instruments, the lines were originally angular and in many ways Li Si's achievements were made obsolete by the appearance of brush and ink (see Chinese calligraphy). The ink-wet brush creates a line quite different from a sharp stylus. It affords variation in thickness and curve of line. Calligraphy retained the block form of Li Si and his eight strokes but the writer was free to create characters that emphasized aesthetically pleasing balance and form. The way a character was written gave a message of style.|$|E

500|$|K'inich Yat Ahk II also {{commissioned}} the carving of Lintel 3, which {{was placed on}} the O-13 Pyramid. The lintel is both an intricate narrative of daily life in the palace, as well as a documentation of the 749 AD K'atun jubilee, which had been celebrated by Itzam K'an Ahk II. According to the artifact, the celebration was attended by many dignitaries, including local nobles such as a b'aah sajal named K'an Mo' Te' who had served K'inich Yo'nal Ahk II, as well as the [...] "interregnum" [...] ruler of Yaxchilan, Yopaat Bahlam II. According to Martin and Grube, the importance of Panel 3 is its relevance to Piedras Negras's history. At the time, the Maya center had fallen behind when compared to Yaxchilan. As such, K'inich Yat Ahk II's erection of the lintel seems to be an attempt by the ajaw to harken back <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> Piedras Negras was in a position of superiority. To this day, many archaeologists and Mayanists consider Panel 3 to be a masterpiece of Maya art due to it elucidating the life of Itzam K'an Ahk II and his servants, as well as providing information regarding rare grammatical structures in the Mayan glyphs.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of {{repeated}} racial bigotry, Russell refused to respond to fan acclaim or friendship from his neighbors, thinking it was insincere and hypocritical. This attitude contributed to his legendarily bad rapport with fans and journalists. He alienated Celtics fans by saying, [...] "You owe the public the same it owes you, nothing! I refuse to smile and be nice to the kiddies." [...] This supported the opinion of many white fans that Russell (who was by then the highest-paid Celtic) was egotistical, paranoid and hypocritical. The already hostile atmosphere between Russell and Boston hit its apex when vandals broke into his house, covered the walls with racist graffiti, damaged his trophies and defecated in the beds. In response, Russell described Boston as a [...] "flea market of racism". In King Of The Court by Aram Goudsouzian, he was quoted saying, [...] "From my very first year I {{thought of myself as}} playing for the Celtics, not for Boston. The fans could do or think whatever they wanted." [...] Referring <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the Celtics could not sell out the Boston Garden despite hockey’s popularity in the same stadium, Russell recalled “We [...] did a survey about what we could do to improve attendance. Over 50 percent of responses said 'There’s too many black players.'” In retirement, Russell described the Boston press as corrupt and racist; in response, Boston sports journalist Larry Claflin claimed that Russell himself was the real racist.|$|E
