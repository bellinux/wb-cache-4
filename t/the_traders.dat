With the remaining two gangs by their side, the Sole Survivor will have to eliminate the rogue gang. Their actions ultimately decide who controls Nuka-World.

5|$|Streamside camps offered wood, water, {{and some}} {{protection}} from the hazards of open land. The prairie could be dangerous in time of native unrest, and trade ceased entirely for a time during the Dakota War of 1862. Prairie fires, driven by winds, were a risk in dry spells. Wet weather turned rivers into torrents, approaches to streams into bogs, and worn paths into morasses. Blizzards could strand traders and threaten them with starvation. Insects harassed both <b>the</b> <b>traders</b> and their draft animals, depriving them of sleep and weakening them.|$|E

Meanwhile, from <b>the</b> <b>traders</b> who visited Wahid, he also heard stories of the crimes committed in major cities such as Singapore. In 1913 Soeman enrolled at a local Malay school, where his teachers reinforced the importance of reading. Soeman took this lesson to heart, reading numerous books by European and Malay authors from the school library before he graduated in 1918.|$|E

5|$|In the Byzantine {{period the}} {{evolution}} of the port is halted due to the frequent invasions by the migratory people, the trade was fading and <b>the</b> <b>traders</b> were looking for other more secure markets like Venice or Genoa but many constructions in the port maintain the name genovese in the memory of the merchants from the Italian city. After a brief period when the port was under Romanian rule, the Dobruja region was occupied by the Ottoman Empire. In 1857, the Turkish authorities leased the port and the Cernavodă–Constanța Railway to the British company Danube and Black Sea Railway and Kustendge Harbour Company Ltd.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} crop of the Mikea is corn, which {{was introduced to}} Madagascar in the 1890s. They also occasionally grow manioc. The dry season is used to cut new corn fields, which are burned in October (swidden agriculture, locally termed hatsaky) and planted in November and December as the rains begin to fall. This corn is harvested three months later and consumed during the wet season; surplus is dried and sold, with some saved for the following year's planting and consumption. <b>The</b> <b>traders</b> who gather the maize from the Mikea process it for international export at a significant profit.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the added}} {{protection}} of CITES Appendix I status, wild slow lorises still receive poor protection because {{enforcement of the}} international trade ban is difficult and the penalties are minor. Slow lorises are still found in large numbers at animal markets, most notably in Cambodia and Indonesia, but <b>the</b> <b>traders</b> show no concern for being caught. During a study by Nekaris etal. published in 2010, vendors in Medan, Jakarta, and Surabaya spoke freely to researchers about how they obtain slow lorises, their uses in medicine, prices, and sales numbers. The markets were not concealed, but were open daily in a designated area in town. Even law enforcement {{is involved in the}} trade, with park rangers and police admitting to the purchase of slow lorises for medicinal purposes. The wife of another law enforcement official from the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia {{is one of the most}} notable sellers of slow loris parts.|$|E

5000|$|Trading {{platforms}} offer rollovers but {{the process}} involves a rollover interest fee which is calculated according {{to the difference between}} the interest rates of the traded currencies. If the interest rate on <b>the</b> <b>trader's</b> long position is higher than the rate on the short position, <b>the</b> <b>trader</b> receives <b>the</b> interest. If the interest rate on <b>the</b> <b>trader's</b> short position is higher than the rate on the long position, then <b>the</b> <b>trader</b> pays <b>the</b> interest.

50|$|A trader {{has sold}} 75 put {{contracts}} on XYZ Corp. stock, struck at $50 and expiring on Saturday, October 20, 2012. On Friday, October 19—the last day these contracts are traded—XYZ stock closes at $49.97, {{which means the}} options are $0.03 in-the-money. Because each contract represents an obligation to buy 100 shares of XYZ stock at $50.00, <b>the</b> <b>trader</b> will have to buy anywhere from 0 shares to 7500 shares of XYZ stock {{as a result of}} the puts being exercised. In fact, only 49 of the contracts are exercised, meaning that <b>the</b> <b>trader</b> must buy 4900 shares of the underlier. If at the close on Friday, October 19, <b>the</b> <b>trader's</b> position in XYZ stock was short 7,500 shares, then on Monday, October 22, <b>the</b> <b>trader</b> would still be short 2600 shares, instead of flat as <b>the</b> <b>trader</b> had hoped. <b>The</b> <b>trader</b> must now buy back these 2600 shares in order to avoid being exposed to risk that XYZ will increase in price.|$|R
5|$|In {{central and}} {{northern}} Italy and in Flanders, {{the rise of}} towns that were to a degree self-governing stimulated economic growth and created an environment for new types of trade associations. Commercial cities {{on the shores of}} the Baltic entered into agreements known as the Hanseatic League, and the Italian Maritime republics such as Venice, Genoa, and Pisa expanded their trade throughout the Mediterranean. Great trading fairs were established and flourished in northern France during the period, allowing Italian and German merchants to trade with each other as well as local merchants. In the late 13th century new land and sea routes to the Far East were pioneered, famously described in The Travels of Marco Polo written by one of <b>the</b> <b>traders,</b> Marco Polo (d. 1324). Besides new trading opportunities, agricultural and technological improvements enabled an increase in crop yields, which in turn allowed the trade networks to expand. Rising trade brought new methods of dealing with money, and gold coinage was again minted in Europe, first in Italy and later in France and other countries. New forms of commercial contracts emerged, allowing risk to be shared among merchants. Accounting methods improved, partly through the use of double-entry bookkeeping; letters of credit also appeared, allowing easy transmission of money.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, the River Aire was navigable to Knottingley, and boats {{carrying}} up to 30tons {{traded on the}} river, which was tidal up to this point. <b>The</b> <b>traders</b> of Leeds were keen to have a navigable link to the town, to make easier the export of woollen cloth, but bills presented to Parliament in 1621 and 1625 had failed. William Pickering, who was mayor of Leeds, had made further attempts to obtain an act of Parliament for improvements to the river in 1679, again without success. As the 1600s drew to a close, a number of bills were passed for other rivers, and there was general support for river navigations. A bill was drawn up in 1698, with support from wool traders in Leeds and general merchants in Wakefield. John Hadley surveyed the Aire, and Samuel Shelton surveyed the Calder. Although the bill {{had a lot of}} support, it was opposed by the City of York, who feared that the River Ouse would be damaged by the scheme.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} slaves in Indiana were {{owned by the}} French traders who entered the region and introduced the practice to the native tribes. Jesuit priests encouraged the tribes they lived among to adopt slavery {{as an alternative to}} executing their prisoners in war. According to some classical historians, the decline of cannibalism among the tribes was {{a direct result of the}} rise of slavery. Early slaves were often Native Americans who were sold to pay debts. The early slaves typically performed manual labor, helping <b>the</b> <b>traders</b> transport their goods and to build forts and trading posts. While part of new France, laws were enacted to give slaves some protection from their masters. Torture and mutilation of slaves was forbidden, and families were prevented from being forcibly broken up. Other laws allowed slaves to be seized by creditors as payment. Other laws required that if a master had children by a slave, the slave and her children were then to be freed. Their status under the French laws was similar to that of minors.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} how an ODP Trader {{can be implemented}} using the X. 500 Directory Standard.

50|$|A zero-intelligence trader (ZI) is {{a simple}} {{algorithmic}} trader in a market based on the dumb agent theory who proposes to purchase (bid) or to sell (ask) randomly, subject only to minimal constraints. Constraints might be resource or bankruptcy constraints imposed externally {{by the rules of}} the market. Ownership of sufficient resources to buy <b>the</b> items <b>the</b> <b>trader</b> bids for, or ownership of resources <b>the</b> <b>trader</b> offers for sale are examples of such market-imposed constraints. Alternatively, the constraints may be internal to <b>the</b> <b>trader.</b> Not bidding more than the value of the resource to <b>the</b> <b>trader,</b> and not asking less than the cost of the resource to <b>the</b> <b>trader</b> are examples of such internal constraints. Under either interpretation, ZI traders use minimal intelligence in choosing their actions in markets.|$|R
5|$|Although the use {{of small}} private vessels for {{personal}} transport undoubtably extends back into prehistory, large ships capable of braving the open ocean were typically dedicated to trade or fishing for most of human history. Even military campaigns would often simply hire or commandeer these private fleets to serve as troop transports, as did <b>the</b> <b>traders,</b> pilgrims, and wealthy tourists of antiquity and the Middle Ages. The voyages of exploration and colonization were often provided for by the crown out of naval funds; where they were not, they were usually chartered or else purchased and then used for shipping supplies after the initial settlement. Dedicated and scheduled local passenger services came to be offered in the 16th and 17th centuries, but the 1817 Black Ball was the first trans-Atlantic passenger line. In the Age of Sail, the duration of such passages depended much on the prevailing winds and the weather. The 18th-century coastal Margate hoys began the popularization of leisure travel in Britain and Ireland that later gathered steam with Thomas Cook's package tours in the next century. During the 19th century, steam-powered ocean liners connected the railroad networks of the world. By 1900, the Atlantic crossing took about five days and the passenger lines competed to win the Blue Riband, an unofficial accolade accorded to the fastest liner in regular service. For twenty years from 1909, the prize went to the RMS Mauretania for its average speed of 26.06 knots (48.26km/h). This era waned as cheaper and faster intercontinental flights became available, most importantly the 1958 New York City–Paris route.|$|E
