25|$|The {{medications}} Piperazine and <b>Thiabendazole</b> are {{no longer}} commonly used as equine wormers; they {{have been replaced by}} the above drugs.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{the use of}} <b>thiabendazole</b> has waned, newer {{generation}} benzimidazole compounds such as albendazole and fenbendazole are to {{this day}} used widely in people and domestic animals.|$|E
25|$|Gordon {{also played}} a major role in the {{introduction}} of <b>thiabendazole</b> (a member of the benzimidazole family) as an anthelmintic for sheep in the early 1960s. In September 1961 in the journal Nature, he reported on his laboratory and field trials that demonstrated this compound exhibited a very high degree of anthelmintic activity against most of the major internal parasites of sheep.|$|E
25|$|Piperazine is a flaccid paralyzing {{agent that}} blocks the {{response}} of Ascaris muscle to acetylcholine, which immobilizes the worm. It prevents migration when treatment is accomplished with weak drugs such as <b>thiabendazole.</b> If used by itself, it causes the worm to be passed out in the feces and may be used when worms have caused blockage of the intestine or the biliary duct.|$|E
25|$|Medications {{that are}} used to kill roundworms are called ascaricides. Those {{recommended}} by the World Health Organization for ascariasis are: albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole and pyrantel pamoate. Other effective agents include tribendimidine and nitazoxanide. Pyrantel pamoate may induce intestinal obstruction in a heavy worm load. Albendazole is contraindicated during pregnancy and children under two years of age. <b>Thiabendazole</b> may cause migration of the worm into the esophagus, so it is usually combined with piperazine.|$|E
25|$|Mammomonogamiasis is {{relatively}} easy to treat. Manual or bronchoscopic removal of worms has been successful. One case followed up with aspiration. Although no controlled study on the efficacy of antihelmintics in treating mammomonogamiasis has been conducted, most patients were given albendazole, mebendazole or <b>thiabendazole</b> with no adverse effects. Patients given albendazole were instructed to take 400mg for three days or if given a combination of drugs, albendazole is given 200mg, three times a day for three days, with mebendazole at 100mg, three times a day for three days. The drug regimens ranged from 200–3000mg/day for three to 20 days.|$|E
2500|$|Commercial {{significant}} thiazoles include mainly dyes and fungicides. [...] Thifluzamide, Tricyclazole, and <b>Thiabendazole</b> are marketed {{for control}} of various agricultural pests. Another widely used thiazole derivative is the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Meloxicam. The following anthroquinone dyes contain benzothiazole subunits: Algol Yellow 8 (CAS# [...] ), Algol Yellow GC (CAS# [...] ), Indanthren Rubine B (CAS# [...] ), Indanthren Blue CLG (CAS# , and Indanthren Blue CLB (CAS#). These thiazole dye are used for dyeing cotton.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Thiabendazole</b> {{has been}} shown to result in a small but {{significant}} decrease in microfilariae and in eosinophil count, and symptoms as treatment for symptomatic M. perstans infection. These markers were reduced even further following the administration of the second dose, showing that <b>thiabendazole</b> may be effective in M. perstans infection. [...] In a recent comparative study, <b>thiabendazole</b> at a higher activity than single drug treatments such as ivermectin, DEC, and mebendazole, but lower activity than the combined regimen of mebendazole and DEC. [...] However, more research may be needed into confirm the correct dosage and true effectiveness of <b>thiabendazole</b> in combating M. perstans infection.|$|E
50|$|Treatment is {{by either}} <b>thiabendazole</b> or mebendazole.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} ways to manage dry rot. Application of <b>thiabendazole,</b> also known as Mertect, was a common and efficacious method used from 1970-1985. Eventually, however, the {{pathogen}} developed resistance to the chemical treatment, and while some people still use <b>thiabendazole,</b> it is no longer an effective treatment.|$|E

50|$|From 1957 to 1990 Campbell {{worked at}} Merck Institute for Therapeutic Research, and from 1984 to 1990 {{he was a}} Senior Scientist and Director with Assay Research and Development. He became a U.S. citizen in 1962. One of his discoveries while at Merck was the {{fungicide}} <b>thiabendazole,</b> used to treat potato blight, historically a scourge of Ireland. <b>Thiabendazole</b> {{is also used to}} treat trichinosis in humans.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Thiabendazole,</b> {{may cause}} {{migration}} of the worm into the esophagus, {{so it is}} usually combined with piperazine.|$|E
50|$|Anthelmintics such as {{mebendazole}} and albendazole {{have been}} reported to eliminate infestation of humans more effectively than <b>thiabendazole.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Strongyloidiasis, as an {{alternative}} to ivermectin or <b>thiabendazole</b> Albendazole can be given with diethylcarbamazine to lower microfilaremia levels.|$|E
5000|$|Another agent {{which can}} be applied either topically or taken by mouth is <b>thiabendazole</b> (trade name Mintezol)), an anti-helminthic.|$|E
50|$|Tiabendazole (INN, BAN), <b>thiabendazole</b> (AAN, USAN), TBZ (and {{the trade}} names Mintezol, Tresaderm, and Arbotect) is a {{fungicide}} and parasiticide.|$|E
50|$|Use of {{metronidazole}} or <b>thiabendazole</b> {{may make}} extraction easier, but also {{may lead to}} migration {{to other parts of}} the body.|$|E

5000|$|In the UK, {{mebendazole}} and piperazine {{are currently}} (2007) preferred. [...] Mebendazole {{has a much}} higher failure rate in clinical practice than albendazole, <b>thiabendazole,</b> or ivermectin.|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{the use of}} <b>thiabendazole</b> has waned, newer {{generation}} benzimidazole compounds such as albendazole and fenbendazole are to {{this day}} used widely in people and domestic animals.|$|E
50|$|Medicinally, <b>thiabendazole</b> {{is also a}} {{chelating}} agent, {{which means}} it is used medicinally to bind metals in cases of metal poisoning, such as lead, mercury, or antimony poisoning.|$|E
50|$|For the {{treatment}} of human cases, removal of the worm is suggested. Topical treatment with cocaine or <b>thiabendazole</b> have also been reported to kill the worms in human cases.|$|E
50|$|Successful {{treatment}} of human cases with <b>thiabendazole</b> or albendazole (with or without corticosteroids) have been reported. Albendazole {{must be taken}} with food because a fatty meal will increase the Bioavailability of the drug.|$|E
50|$|Ivermectin {{is highly}} {{effective}} {{even at the}} low dose of 100 μg per kg, and pyrantel is also effective at 25-50 mg per kg. Benzimidazoles such as mebendazole, parbendazole and <b>thiabendazole</b> are also highly effective.|$|E
50|$|PPD {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{obstacles}} currently preventing farmers from exporting cassavas abroad and generating income. Fresh cassava can be preserved like potato, using <b>thiabendazole</b> or bleach as a fungicide, then wrapping in plastic, coating in wax or freezing.|$|E
50|$|Acanthocephaliasis {{is treated}} with anti-helminthics. There is {{considerable}} {{debate over the}} efficacy of anti-helminth drugs on this parasite, but thus far, the drugs seem to be working. Pyrantel pamoate and ivermectin {{have been shown to}} be particularly effective in treating patients. Mebendazole and <b>thiabendazole</b> have also both been cited to work.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{introduced}} as antihelminthic in livestock in 1940 and is considered, with <b>thiabendazole,</b> {{to be the}} first modern antihelminthic. [...] The first instances of resistance were noted in 1961. [...] Uses for this purpose in the US are still described but it has [...] "virtually disappeared from the market." ...|$|E
50|$|Most benzimidazoles are effective. Mebendazole, {{triclabendazole}} and fenbendazole {{are commonly}} used. Ivermectin and pyrantel pamoate are also effective. The combination of ivermectin 6 μg/kg and pyrantel pamoate at 5.0 mg/kg is 100% efficacious against adult worms in dogs. Human infection {{in case of}} cutaneous larva migrans is treated with oral <b>thiabendazole</b> at 500 mg in 4 daily dose.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thiabendazole</b> is {{also used}} as a food additive, a {{preservative}} with E number E233 (INS number 233). For example, it is applied to bananas to ensure freshness, and is a common ingredient in the waxes applied to the skins of citrus fruits. It is not approved as a food additive in the EU, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
