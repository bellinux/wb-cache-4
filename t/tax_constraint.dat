Indeed, <b>tax</b> <b>constraint</b> induces a behaviour modification, so that the legal rules produce important economic implications. We first consider the particular position of the old French public financial economics; then, we underline some public economics' failures, and especially the optimal taxation theory ones. These flaws relate to the economic, fiscal and institutional specifications of the models. We present, then, the new fiscal economics of law framework of analysis. It pretends to take into account tax law and institutions' complexity. Finally, we draw a first critical assessment and propose a future research program, argued in three main directions. In addition to the fact that thenew fiscal economics of law carries out an analysis based primarily on costs, it under estimates the tax evasion results in terms of equity. The suggested framework ignores the way legal conflicts between the taxpayer and the administration are really resolved. This leads us to analyze the institutions'evolution issue. Thus, a true methodological renewal is needed. Tax law, efficiency costs, economics of law. ...|$|E

40|$|A Dissertation AbstractMakassar City {{has been}} {{experiencing}} high population growth which {{has resulted in}} unbalanced high density levels in some urban quarters leading to deterioration in the living environment. With still no power for implementing zoning regulations, one option for controlling and directing population growth would be the use of progressive property tax on land and building {{in the form of}} incentives and disincentives. As a first step, this study aims to discover opportunities towards introduction of such a tax based control mechanism. It examines the characteristics of urban area in Makassar City based on factors such as population, land price, infrastructure, and the availability of various public facilities. The influence of these factors on land price is examined through regression analysis and based on the results. The analysis results show that there is still some mismatch in the amount of infrastructure and services being provided in certain parts of the city which could be taken up as opportunities for the utilization of property tax as an instrument for steering population densities in the urban areas. Next, this study looks at the possibility of developing a Cellular Automata model incorporating tax and geographical conditions for simulating urban growth process with a view of using it in the future as a tool for directing growth in Makassar City, Indonesia. ??The developed model uses land tax values in addition to geographical condition constraints such as rivers, flood prone areas and nature conservation areas. ??The CA model with incorporated <b>tax</b> <b>constraints</b> is examined together with a model with only the geographical constraints. Their performance is tested using the multi-scale goodness of-fit. ??The CA model incorporating the land <b>tax</b> <b>constraints</b> produced slightly better simulation results under different parameter settings as compared with the geographic conditions.

Over the longer run, well-targeted permanent reductions in budget deficits lead to a considerable increase in both the growth rate and the level of output.

40|$|This paper characterises the jointly optimal {{monetary}} and fiscal stabilisation policy {{in a new}} Keynesian model that allows for consumers who lacking access to asset markets consume their disposable income each period. With full asset market participation, the optimal policy relies entirely on the interest rate to stabilise cost-push shocks and government expenditure is not changed. When asset market participation is limited, there is a case for fiscal stabilisation policy. Active use of public spending raises aggregate welfare because it enables a more balanced distribution of the stabilisation burden across asset-holding and non-asset-holding consumers. The optimal response of government expenditure is sensitive to the financing scheme and whether the policymaker has access to a targeted transfer that can directly redistribute resources between consumers.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this article is to analyze how four company law cases (Daily Mail, Centros, Uberseering, and Inspire Art) in the European Community have {{expanded}} the Freedom of Establishment to potentially open the door to corporate jurisdictional competition in the European Community, similar to the sort that exists in the United States through the Delaware effect. However, in Europe, this type of jurisdictional competition has traditionally been thought of as undesirable, particularly in certain Member States such as Germany that have co-determination and minimum capital requirements. These Member States have continued to adhere to the real seat and stakeholder theory doctrines and it is highly likely that they will continue to try to employ national level restrictions in order to evade the evolving EC jurisprudence and to ultimately evade jurisdictional competition. Recently, the SE statute was enacted. This statute on its face appears inconsistent with the evolving case law that appears to open the door to jurisdictional competition, and to therefore potentially further the cause of the anti-jurisdictional competition Member States. However, this article shows that the SE statute will most likely not halt jurisdictional competition due to a loophole in the SE statute that allows a European SE company to merge into a national subsidiary and in a two year period to become subject to the law of that Member State. Although Member States such as Germany will be able to continue to burden emigration by potentially imposing <b>tax</b> <b>constraints</b> or appraisal rights, such Member States will risk not being able to participate in the forthcoming European international corporate reorganization movement. As a result, this article predicts that in the long run, a full jurisdictional competition will ensue in Europe, to the detriment of the values embodied in the stakeholder theory of corporate law...|$|R
40|$|A tax on gross assets {{has been}} {{introduced}} in some developing countries where several factors (most notably, high inflation) enabled apparently viable enterprises to report losses for income tax purposes. The idea of a tax {{on the value of}} assets, rather than on the income that the assets generate, seems to have originated in the 17 th century in Milan. It was more recently advocated by Luigi Einaudi and Maurice Allais, but their contributions have remained unknown in the Anglo-Saxon world. The economic implications of such a tax are analyzed in this paper. Special attention is devoted to efficiency and administrative aspects. Practical considerations suggest that the tax on gross assets serves as a minimum income tax rather than as a final tax.

This market imperfection drives the endogenous discrepancy between the household and planner discount factors: households face the possibility of being debt constrained in the future, and as a result have a higher discount factor than the planner, who does not face such a constraint. In such an economy, the planner will choose an optimal capital level that is lower than that chosen by households; this diÂ¤erence in the choice of capital motivates imposing a positive capital income tax on households to induce them to invest at the socially optimal amountCapital <b>Tax,</b> borrowing <b>constraint,</b> enforcement...|$|R
