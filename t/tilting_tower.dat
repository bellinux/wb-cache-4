40|$|The ISTUK deep drill was {{developed}} in 1978 - 1980. The drill is mechanical. The cuttings are sucked from the bits into storage chambers in the drill, and brought to the surface with each core increment (typically 2. 4 m in length). Because the actual drilling time is {{a fraction of the}} total run time, with most of the time spent going {{up and down in the}} drill hole, much emphasis has been placed on reducing the friction in the hole and in reducing the time consumed on the surface. In order to simplify the drilling operation, the steel drill cable uses only one wire with the armour acting as power return. Also, to enhance the reliability of the drilling, most drill control tasks are taken care of by a down borehole processor. The drill was first used during 1979 - 1981 at Dye- 3 in south Greenland, and lately during 1990 - 1992 at Summit, central Greenland. The Summit drill is physically the same as the Dye- 3 drill however, the motor section has been replaced, as have the high-pressure gaskets. The cutters and the core catchers are basically the same, but the angles have been changed slightly. The electronics are new, although the functions performed are unchanged. The winch and the <b>tilting</b> <b>tower</b> are both of new construction and use an electronic variable frequency inverter to drive a standard 3 -phase electrical motor. A load transducer is built into the center bolt of the sheave in the drill tower. The readout from this transducer indicates the cable load with high resolution...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDiagrid {{structures}} are prevalently used for today's tall buildings {{due to their}} structural efficiency and architectural aesthetic potentials. This paper studies structural performance of diagrid systems employed for complex-shaped tall buildings such as twisted, <b>tilted</b> and freeform <b>towers.</b> For each complex form category, tall buildings are designed with diagrid systems, and their structural efficiency is studied in conjunction with building forms. In order to investigate the impacts of variation of important geometric configurations of complex-shaped tall buildings, such as the rate of twisting and angle of tilting, parametric structural models are used for this study. Based on the study results, design considerations are discussed for the efficient use of diagrid structures for complex-shaped tall buildings...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The deep ice-sheet coring (DISC) drill {{consists}} of four major mechanical drilling subsystems and four subsystems supporting on-surface activities. The mechanical drilling subsystems are a drill sonde, a drill cable, a tower and a winch. The drill sonde is the down-hole portion of the drill system and {{consists of}} six distinct sections: (1) the cutter head, (2) the core barrel, (3) the screen section, (4) the motor/pump section, (5) the instrument section and (6) the upper sonde, which includes anti-torques and drill cable terminations. The drill cable not only provides the means of supporting the drill sonde in the borehole, but also provides conduits for electrical power and data transmission. The <b>tower</b> <b>tilts</b> to allow the drill sonde to be serviced in the horizontal position without removing it from the tower. The winch provides a means of quickly raising the sonde from the borehole and providing the fine control necessary for coring operations...|$|R
40|$|The fluid {{state on}} a sieve tray will change when the <b>towers</b> <b>tilt</b> under wind loads. A {{computational}} fluid dynamics (CFD) model was used to predict the flow patters and hydraulics on the tray under different inclinations. The gas and liquid phases are modelled with the volume-of-fluid (VOF) framework as two inmiscible phases. Several three-dimensional transient simulations were carried out for a 0. 38 m diameter tray with varying liquid weir loads and inclined angles. The clear liquid height determined from these simulations is in reasonable agreement with experimental measurements carried out for air-water in a round tray of the same dimensions. The simulation results show that, compared with the horizontal tray, the circulation area is bigger when the liquid flow and inclination direction of the tray are the same, but when they are opposite the circulation area is smaller. The percentage of circulation area to the tray area can obviously be decreased, along with increasing liquid weir loads. It is concluded that CFD {{can be used for}} the prediction of liquid flow on sieve trays under different inclination...|$|R
40|$|Floating {{offshore}} wind turbines {{have the potential}} to commercially convert the vast wind resource in deep-water area. Compared with fixed-bottom wind turbines, motions of the floating foundation complicate vibrations and loads of the wind turbine in offshore environment. To alleviate the responses of the wind turbine, this study investigates the use of fore–aft tuned mass damper (TMD) in nacelle/tower for passive control of a semi-submersible {{offshore wind}} turbine. A simplified structural model, considering the degree-of-freedom of platform pitch and surge, <b>tower</b> <b>tilt</b> and TMD translation, is proposed in the light of motion features of semi-submersible platform. After identifying ten unknown parameters, the correctness of the deterministic model is validated by pitch free decay responses. The mass, stiffness and damping of TMD are optimized using both method of exhaustion and genetic algorithm to avoid local minimum. Six optimized TMD devices are evaluated under three kinds of realistic environment conditions. The control effectiveness is assessed by the extreme and fatigue response reduction ratios. It is found that the high stiffness TMDs that directly dissipate the energy of tower oscillation exhibit an overall stable performance. Similar to the spar-type foundation, the TMDs in the nacelle/tower are capable of extending the service life of floating wind turbines...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{counterweight}} applied on the foundation slab of a leaning tower resting on deformable soils are analysed. The analysis is carried out {{on the base of}} a visco-elasto-plastic constitutive model, representing the mechanical behaviour of the soil (S) - foundation (F) geotechnical system, under loads whose intensity varies according to the <b>tilting</b> of the <b>tower.</b> The concept of admissible counterweight is first developed. The immediate {{effects of a}}n admissible counterweight, and above all the elastic tilt reduction of the tower, are then determined {{as a function of the}} geometry of the tower and of its foundation, of the characteristics - weight and eccentrity - of the counterweight as well as of the current yielding level of the S-F system. Time evolution of rotation of the foundation-tower system loaded by the counterweight is finally analysed. it is demonstrated that without further perturbations, the system generally evolves towards a long term equilibrium condition. On the contrary, expecially if the tower is subjected to perturbations, the progressively increasing rotation may lead the system towards an instability condition: the critical values of the rotation and of the time corresponding to this ultimate limit state are obtained. The analytical solutions of considered problems are expressed in closed form, making results easily applicable to practical cases...|$|R
50|$|The typical nuraghe is {{situated}} in areas where previous prehistoric Sardinian cultures had been distributed, that is not far from alluvial plains (though few nuraghes appear in plains nowadays, as they were destroyed by human activities such as agriculture, dams and others) and has {{the shape of a}} truncated conical tower resembling a medieval tower (outside) or a beehive (inside). The structure's walls consist of three components: an outer layer shaped like a <b>tower</b> (<b>tilted</b> inwards and made of many layers of stones whose size diminishes with height: mostly, lower layers consist of rubble masonry, while upper layers tend to ashlar masonry), an inner layer, made of smaller stones (to form a corbelled dome of the bullet-shaped tholos type, and where ashlar masonry is used more frequently), and an intermediate layer of very small pieces and dirt, which makes the whole construction very sturdy: it stands only by virtue of the weight of its stones, which may each amount to several tons. Some nuraghes are about 20 meters (60 ft) in height, the tallest one known, Nuraghe Arrubiu, reached a height of 25-30 meters. The entrance leads into a corridor, on whose sides are often open niches, that leads to the round chamber. A spiral stone stair, leading to upper floors (if present) and/or to a terrace, was built within the thick walls and it was illuminated by embrasures.|$|R
