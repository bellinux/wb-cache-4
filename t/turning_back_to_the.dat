5|$|The July 1, 1919, {{incarnation}} of M-89 was much shorter relative to today's road. Its western terminus {{was at a}} junction with M-11 (later US31, now A-2) near Ganges. It traveled east to Fennville then turned south to Pearl before <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east towards Allegan on an alignment that is a few {{miles south of the}} present day configuration. The highway then left Allegan on present day M-222 and terminated at M-13, which is now A-45 east of the US131 freeway.|$|E
5|$|Washington State Route 221 (SR221) {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with SR14 in the unincorporated community of Paterson. After leaving Paterson the highway travels north through rural farm land as a two-lane highway. A few minor roads are intersected before the roadway {{turns to the}} west after about , before <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north. After the highway resumes its northerly course it climbs into the Horse Heaven Hills, gaining a passing lane through the uphill segments, before finally terminating at SR22 in south Prosser.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Arthur re-intensified somewhat as it traversed The Maritimes; a sting jet with gusts of 65–80mph (100–130km/h) developed along the storm's backside. The former hurricane made an additional landfall {{in the region}} near Fundy National Park by 18:00UTC. By July6, the sting jet had dissipated, and steady weakening of the cyclone resumed as only a split jet provided upper-level support to the storm. <b>Turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast, Arthur moved through Labrador later that day. Once over the Labrador Sea, Arthur turned northwest while weakening before doubling back to the southeast. After weakening below gale-force strength, the extratropical system dissipated late on July9.|$|E

5|$|With warm {{waters and}} {{favorable}} upper-level conditions, Helinda attained cyclone status on February1, and the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). Around the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 215km/h (130mph), slightly below its estimate for the cyclone's peak winds in the Australian region. Due to a powerful ridge near Île Amsterdam, Helinda {{turned to the}} southeast on February2, where cooler water temperatures induced weakening. Two days later, strong wind shear contributed to further weakening, and the storm deteriorated to tropical depression status. <b>Turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, the circulation was declared dissipated by the MFR on February7, although the JTWC continued tracking Helinda until February14 when the system was off the northeast coast of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Alibera quickly intensified, {{attaining}} {{tropical cyclone}} status on December20 while southwest of Agaléga. Although the MFR estimated 10‑minute winds of 140km/h (85mph) that day, the JTWC assessed that {{the storm was}} vastly stronger, estimating peak 1‑minute winds of 250km/h (150mph). This is equivalent to a super typhoon, which made Alibera tied for the strongest cyclone in the southern hemisphere that season, along with Cyclone Alex in the Australian basin. On December21, Alibera turned sharply {{to the south and}} slowly weakened. On the next day, the storm curved to an eastward drift as a downgraded severe tropical storm, its path influenced by ridges to the east and west. It maintained its intensity for the next several days, <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south on December24 and slowly recurving to the west. However, the movement was erratic, and the storm executed four small loops. Although the MFR had forecasting difficulties during this time, the storm remained far enough {{to the north of the}} Mascarene Islands to limit rainfall warnings.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{wind shear}} {{accelerated}} {{the rate of}} weakening, causing Blanca's mid- and low-level circulation centers to decouple. By 18:00UTC on June7, the hurricane degraded to a tropical storm. Around 10:30UTC on June8, Blanca made landfall over Isla Santa Margarita {{off the coast of}} Baja California Sur before striking the mainland, near Puerto Argudin, at 11:15UTC. This marked the earliest known landfall in the state, and peninsula, on record during a calendar year. It surpassed the previous earliest—Tropical Storm Calvin on July8, 1993—by a month. <b>Turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest, the system briefly emerged back over the Pacific Ocean before weakening to a tropical depression. Blanca made its third and final landfall near El Patrocinio around 20:30UTC. With deep convection no longer present, the depression degraded into a remnant low early on June9 over the central Baja California peninsula before dissipating hours later.|$|E

5|$|US-60 {{would be}} realigned through {{many of the}} towns it served in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The highway was {{adjusted}} through Fairland to use Connor Avenue, a shorter, straighter route through town; this change was approved on July 11, 1949. The highway's route through Nowata was altered next, on November 13, 1950. Previously, US-60 followed Delaware Avenue to Oak Street, where it turned south, before <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east on Cherokee Avenue; after the change, it turns south on Pine Street and joins Cherokee Avenue further west. On the same date, the highway was realigned through Bartlesville. The US-60 system through Ponca City was next to be reworked, on July 14, 1952. The previous US-60 and US-77 Belt Line routes and City Routes were removed {{in favor of a}} new US-60 route bypassing the city to the south on Harding Avenue and proceeding east across a new Arkansas River bridge—the present day route. Further west, US-60 and US-177 were realigned in Tonkawa on May 4, 1953, replacing an alternate US-60/US-177 that previously paralleled the main highway there.|$|E
5|$|After <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest, the {{convection}} around Linfa {{became even}} more symmetrical, although the circulation became slightly elongated. At 06:00UTC on July4, the storm reached a preliminary peak intensity, with 10minute sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph) according to the JMA. As Linfa neared the northern Philippines, {{the bulk of the}} convection was shifted to the southern periphery, due to the continued wind shear. Late on July4, the center of Linfa made landfall over Palanan, Isabela, on the island of Luzon. Moving westward across the island, the circulation became disorganized as the core convection diminished. By late on July5, Linfa emerged into the South China Sea. Once over open waters, Linfa began moving to the north-northwest, still moving around the subtropical ridge, and it was expected to move over Taiwan. The circulation remained well-defined but exposed, with the deep convection displaced to the south. With the isolated thunderstorms and unfavorable wind shear, the JTWC noted the potential for the circulation to dissipate over open waters. By July7, easing wind shear allowed the convection to rebuild and for the structure to improve in organization. By that time, the future of the storm was still uncertain, although a turn to the northwest toward China was expected. Also on July7, PAGASA issued its final bulletin on the storm as Linfa exited their area of responsibility.|$|E
5|$|M-66 {{continues}} northward through Barry County on Capital Avenue {{which becomes}} 9 Mile Road north of Baseline Road. The highway passes through Assyria before meeting M-79, {{with which it}} has a short concurrency, in Nashville. On {{the north side of}} the village, M-66 crosses the Thornapple River and continues north through mixed rural forest land and farm fields. Near Woodland, M-66 joins M-43 and the two run to the northeast and along the Barry–Eaton county line. M-43/M-66 meets M-50 at a four-way intersection southwest of Lake Odessa near Woodbury, and M-43 turns east leaving M-66 in favor of a concurrency with M-50. M-66 crosses a rail line of CSX Transportation and the county line on State Road. It meets I-96 in a rural southern part of the Ionia County south of Ionia. On the south edge of town, the highway passes the county airport and curves to the northeast becoming Dexter Street. While entering downtown Ionia, the trunkline crosses the Grand River and the abandoned mainline of the Grand Rapids Eastern Railroad near the county fairgrounds. M-66 turns west along M-21 (Lincoln Avenue) for two blocks before <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north along State Street. The trunkline runs through the northern part of the county and meets M-44's eastern terminus near Woodard Lake.|$|E

This was the main divisive line between the Reformation and the Renaissance, which dealt with the same basic problems, supported the same science based on reason and empirical research, but had a different set of presuppositions (theistic versus naturalistic).|$|E
25|$|After the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt on 14 October 1806, Emperor Napoleon {{launched}} an all-out {{pursuit of the}} defeated Prussians. At the end of October, the Franch managed to cut off and capture large numbers of Prussian soldiers near Prenzlau and Stettin. Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher's corps evaded capture by <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west. Near Waren, Blücher linked up with another Prussian corps and the combined force withdrew to the west.|$|E
25|$|Just east of {{the county}} line, SH-56 bridges the North Canadian River. South of Castle, the road intersects with SH-48. SH-56 then {{proceeds}} east into Okemah, the county seat, where it has a short concurrency with both US-62 and SH-27. The highway continues east from town, then turns north, before <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east {{to pass through the}} unincorporated settlement of Okfuskee. East of Okfuskee, the highway enters Okmulgee County.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year, Bonaparte, the new artillery {{commander of}} the Army of Italy submitted a plan to strike eastward across neutral Genoese territory to capture Oneglia and turn the Saorgio position from the east. The plan was accepted on 2 April 1794 and Dumerbion's offensive began four days later. In the Second Battle of Saorgio, the French captured Oneglia on 9 April, Ormea the 17th and Garessio on the 19th. <b>Turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, they attacked Saorgio from the northeast on 27 April. Hopelessly outflanked, the Sardinians under Colli retreated and the French occupied Saorgio on the 28th.|$|E
25|$|It briefly {{runs along}} {{the eastern edge of}} New Rochelle's Pinebrook Heights and Pinebrook neighborhoods ahead of an {{interchange}} with the Hutchinson River Parkway (exit20) in the Quaker Ridge section of New Rochelle. Access to the Parkway northbound is via Hutchinson Avenue while southbound access is provided via Stratton Road and Pinebrook Boulevard. County maintenance ends just south of the junction while NY125 continues past the parkway along the New Rochelle–Scarsdale line. It serves residential parts of both communities prior to fully entering Scarsdale and accessing the Heathcote section of the village. Here, the route connects to the west end of the Heathcote Bypass, a two-lane highway running below grade along the northern edge of the neighborhood. The bypass is designated County Route 143 and signed as NY125 Bypass. NY125 continues directly into the center of Heathcote, where it turns northeast onto Palmer Avenue at an intersection known locally as the Five Corners. The route continues northeastward for several blocks before gradually <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north as it heads into nearby Secor Gardens.|$|E
500|$|A preexisting low {{pressure}} area organized into a tropical cyclone on June9 near Chuuk State. It moved to the northwest as a tropical depression, influencing the trade winds on Yap. On June13, the storm executed a small loop to the southwest, later <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest. It eventually intensified into a typhoon, producing a pressure of [...] in the Ryukyu Islands while passing to the east. The system was no a longer a tropical cyclone by June16, either due to dissipation or becoming an extratropical cyclone that continued to the northeast toward Alaska.|$|E

500|$|Hurricane Ione [...] was a strong, Category4 {{hurricane}} {{that affected}} North Carolina in September 1955, bringing high winds and significant rainfall. It {{came on the}} heels of Hurricanes Connie and Diane, and compounded problems already caused by the two earlier hurricanes. [...] Spawned by a tropical wave which left the African coast on September 6, the system became a tropical depression in the tropical North Atlantic, before turning northwest and developing into a hurricane. [...] After <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west east of the Bahamas, Ione turned northwest and northward, moving across eastern North Carolina before moving east-northeastward out to sea.

500|$|West of Sterling, the {{landscape}} changes again; {{in this area}} the freeway enters forest lands. I-75 continues northwestward through Arenac County and crosses into western Ogemaw County. M-30 passes under the freeway without an interchange as I-75 rounds {{the west side of}} West Branch. On the northwest side of that city, M-55 merges onto I-75, and the two highways turn to run concurrently westward into Roscommon County. East of Prudenville, M-55 splits from the freeway. I-75 turns northward to curve around the east of Houghton and Higgins lakes. <b>Turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest, the trunkline bypasses Roscommon to the south and transfers into southern Crawford County.
