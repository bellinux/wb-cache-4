The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay.

A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>it</b> off periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.|$|E

500|$|Upon release, {{the song}} {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. Many reviewers noted similarities to works of early Madonna and Kylie Minogue, {{with the song}} being compared to several of the singers' songs. Jason Damas from PopMatters praised the track for being [...] "a sure contender for future single release", in addition to calling it his [...] "favorite song on the album". He further added: [...] "No Doubt fans who always secretly suspected that Stefani may someday move to become a Madonna-like dance diva will find their proof in this cut, which plagiarizes Kylie Minogue's [...] "Fever" [...] but makes the song even bigger and catchier." [...] Winnie McCroy of The Villager claimed that [...] "Serious" [...] has staying power; he continued: [...] "Despite your best attempts <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>it,</b> you will find yourself humming the chorus", later comparing the track to Madonna's 1992 single [...] "Erotica", and Falco's 1985 single [...] "Rock Me Amadeus". Also in a highly positive review, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine favored [...] "Serious" [...] for [...] "flawlessly recreat the throwaway lyrics, vocal phrasing and background vocals, and synth sounds of the '80s". A critic from Sputnikmusic awarded the recording five out of a five stars, calling it [...] "one of the better songs on the album". The reviewer noted Kanal's role in the song's production: [...] "this song wouldn't be that wonderful without him". Another highly positive review came from Marcus Floyd from Renowned for Sound; in his review of the parent record, he called it [...] "another catchy melody and addictive arrangement from the platinum blonde star". Lisa Haines, a music editor and columnist for BBC, was less favorable in her review, opining that [...] "the cheeky upstart charm Madonna sported in the 80s is embraced to shrewd effect" [...] for the track's duration.|$|E

2500|$|In 1884, Republicans {{who favored}} civil service reform, {{including}} Theodore Roosevelt, supported Edmunds for President over incumbent President Chester Alan Arthur and former Senator James G.

[...] Revelations about Edmunds' legal work for railroads and corporations while sitting in the Senate prevented Edmunds from attaining wide support from reformers. On the first ballot he received 93 votes, but his support declined, and the nomination went to Blaine on the fourth ballot. [...] Edmunds was among the Republicans who gave lukewarm support to Blaine (some backed Cleveland outright), and Blaine lost the general election to Grover Cleveland. [...] At Arthur's funeral in 1886, Edmunds extended his hand to Blaine. [...] Blaine, recalling the 1884 campaign, refused <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
