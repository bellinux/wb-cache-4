25|$|In the Lazair {{application}} the 185 {{was used}} to drive two propellers stacked together in biplane configuration. This was not done for aerodynamic reasons but rather because the Lazair manufacturer had ample quantities of <b>the</b> <b>nylon</b> propellers on hand for its earlier engines and stacking them was more cost efficient than scrapping them and buying new propellers.|$|E
25|$|Equipment {{is carried}} by {{officers}} in a nylon equipment belt, {{also known as}} a gun or weapon belt. <b>The</b> <b>nylon</b> belt, specifically designed to be very light-weight, was first issued in 2003 as a replacement for worn leather belts. The belt consists of one firearm holster placed on the hip (either side), one firearm magazine pouch, one ASP (baton) pouch, one OC Spray pouch, one hand cuff pouch and one holder for the portable radio.|$|E

25|$|At small strains, elastin confers {{stiffness}} to {{the tissue}} and stores {{most of the}} strain energy. The collagen fibers are comparatively inextensible and are usually loose (wavy, crimped). With increasing tissue deformation the collagen is gradually stretched {{in the direction of}} deformation. When taut, these fibers produce a strong growth in tissue stiffness. The composite behavior is analogous to a nylon stocking, whose rubber band does the role of elastin as <b>the</b> <b>nylon</b> does the role of collagen. In soft tissues the collagen limits the deformation and protects the tissues from injury.|$|E

Noten also produced a limited edition of ten unique pieces, each with a different gold element, called Fashionista Golden Girl. In addition a single edition necklace with all gold elements was made and a single edition all gold piece. Noten also produced the lacquered nylon Suffragette ring, priced at €950.00, and the 18K gold Muse ring priced at €18,500.00. The Mom brooch, of laser sintered nylon, is priced at €175.00.|$|E
25|$|Around 2007, a {{new type}} of strings were {{produced}} made of mostly a nylon core coiled with nylon like the metal-nylon strings, possibly in imitation of Western catgut strings. The sound is similar to the metal-nylon strings but without the metallic tone to them (one of the main reasons why traditionalists do not like the metal-nylon strings). <b>The</b> <b>nylon</b> strings are able to be turned to standard pitch without breaking and can sustain their tuning whatever the climate unlike silk. The strings have various names in China but they are advertised as sounding like silk strings prior to the 1950s when silk string production stopped.|$|E

25|$|Smaller {{amounts of}} {{butadiene}} {{are used to}} make <b>the</b> <b>nylon</b> intermediate, adiponitrile, {{by the addition of}} a molecule of hydrogen cyanide to each of the double bonds in a process called hydrocyanation developed by DuPont. Other synthetic rubber materials such as chloroprene, and the solvent sulfolane are also manufactured from butadiene. Butadiene is used in the industrial production of 4-vinylcyclohexene via a Diels Alder dimerization reaction. Vinylcyclohexene is a common impurity found in butadiene upon storage due to dimerization. Cyclooctadiene and cyclododecatriene are produced via nickel- or titanium-catalyzed dimerization and trimerization reactions, respectively. Butadiene is also useful in the synthesis of cycloalkanes and cycloalkenes, as it reacts with double and triple carbon-carbon bonds through the Diels-Alder reaction.|$|E
25|$|In the United States in 1937, the Marihuana Tax Act was passed, and {{prohibited}} {{the production of}} hemp in addition to cannabis. The reasons that hemp was also included in this law are disputed—several scholars have claimed that the act was passed in order to destroy the US hemp industry, with the primary involvement of businessmen Andrew Mellon, Randolph Hearst, and the Du Pont family. But the improvements of the decorticators, machines that separate the fibers from the hemp stem, could not make hemp fiber a very cheap substitute for fibers from other sources because it could not change that basic fact that strong fibers are only found in the bast, the outer part of the stem. Only about 1/3 of the stem are long and strong fibers. The company DuPont and many industrial historians dispute a link between nylon and hemp. They argue {{that the purpose of}} developing <b>the</b> <b>nylon</b> was to produce a fiber {{that could be used in}} thin stockings for females and compete with silk.|$|E

2500|$|The {{interior}} trim remained virtually unchanged from 1973, with standard seating choices, including Strato bucket seats with center console or notchback bench seat with an armrest and cloth or Morrokide upholstery. The bucket seats were available with optional recliners and adjustable lumbar support. However, the real African Crossfire Mahogany trim {{was replaced by}} a simulated material for the instrument panel due to splintering problems on 1973 models; the [...] "real" [...] wood was continued on the console and door panels for another two years.

2500|$|On 12 October {{the weather}} was good but on 13 October it deteriorated, with strong squalls {{making it harder for}} the tug crews to see the hulk.

At about 0130 hrs on 14 October Captain Negro of the Genua radioed his concerns to Captain Gatti of the Torregrande. Gatti asked the Dutch party to authorise the tugs to recover as much as possible of the towing cables and then cast the hulk loose before it sank. At about 0230 hrs Torregrande hauled in its [...] steel cable and began to recover its [...] nylon towing rope. Gatti then cut <b>the</b> <b>nylon</b> rope and cast the hulk adrift.|$|E

2500|$|A tall, {{cylindrical}} {{container with}} padding {{on the bottom}} to keep the points sharp can store straight needles neatly. Fabric or plastic cases similar to cosmetic bags or a chef's knife bag allow straight needles to be stored together yet separated by size, then rolled to maximize space. Circular needles may be stored with the cables coiled in cases made [...] specifically for this purpose or hung dangling from a hanger device with cables straight. [...] If older circulars with <b>the</b> <b>nylon</b> or plastic cables are coiled for storage {{it may be necessary}} to soak them in hot water for a few minutes to get them to uncoil and relax for ease of use. [...] Most recently manufactured cables eliminate this problem and may be stored coiled without any difficulty. [...] Care must be taken not to kink the metal cables of older circulars, as these kinks will not come out and may damage or snag yarn as it is knit.|$|E
2500|$|A South African {{government}} chemist {{examined a}} microscopic particle on <b>the</b> <b>nylon</b> netting {{next to the}} front-right pallet on Flight 295. The chemist found that the airflow patterns on the iron suggested that it travelled at a high velocity while in a molten state; therefore the fire on Flight 295 may have not been a flash fire triggered by packaging. Fred Bereswill, the investigator from Boeing, said that this {{would suggest that the}} source of the fire would have had properties like a sparkler, with the source including its own oxidising agent. [...] A British fire and explosion analyst examined the exterior skin of the aircraft which had been located above the pallet; the analyst found that the skin became as hot as 300 degrees Celsius. [...] Bereswill said that {{it would be difficult for}} a fire to burn through the skin of an aircraft in-flight because of the cool airflow outside the aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|Wheel {{steering}} {{is standard}} (though a tiller was an option on the 37R). The [...] rudder is an internally-mounted spade-type with a [...] "spitfire wing" [...] planform. The rudder is constructed of two molded composite shells which are bonded together and injected with two-part foam for added strength. The rudder post is all stainless steel {{with a flat}} stainless steel plate reinforcing weldment positioned within the rudder. The rudder post passes through the hull with a water-tight, close tolerance fit between the shaft and <b>the</b> <b>nylon</b> bearing. The rudder post is brought up through the cockpit sole, with the steering quadrant mounted on top. The pedestal system is cable-linked with the radial driver being connected to the rudder post by a keyway and lock nuts. Access to the system is achieved via the removable fiberglass cover located in the cockpit sole. This design provides excellent support for the rudder stock. The rudder may be removed by loosening the bolt, rollers and quadrant. The rudder must be supported from below during this procedure.|$|E
