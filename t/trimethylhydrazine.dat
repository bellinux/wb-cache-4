40|$|Four halophosphine {{derivatives}} of <b>trimethylhydrazine</b> were synthesized. Cl 2 PN(CH 3) N(CH) 2 and Cu{N(CH 3) N(CH 3) 2] 2 {{were prepared}} by controlled reactions of FC 1. 3 w 1 th trimethylhydrazineJ {{reaction of the}} chlorophospbines with SbF 3 or NaF led to fiuorinated derivatives, F 2 PN(CB 3) N(CH 3) 2 and FF(N(CH 3) N(CH 3) 2] 2. These four compounds represent the first halophoaphine derivatives of a nitrogen base other than the alkylamines...|$|E
40|$|The surface-catalyzed air {{oxidation}} {{reactions of}} hydrazine, monomethylhydrazine, unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, symmetrical dimethylhydrazine, <b>trimethylhydrazine</b> and tetramethylhydrazine were investigated in a metal-powder packed turbular flow reactor at 55 {{plus or minus}} 3 C. Hydrazine was completely reacted on all surfaces studied. The major products of monomethylhydrazine (MMH) oxidation were methanol, methane and methyldiazene. The di-, tri- and tetra-methyl hydrazines were essentially unreactive under these conditions. The relative catalytic reactivities toward MMH are: Fe greater than Al 2 O 3 greater than Ti greater than Zn greater than 316 SS greater than Cr greater than Ni greater than Al greater than 304 L SS. A kinetic scheme and mechanism involving adsorption, oxidative dehydrogenation and reductive elimination reactions on a metal oxide surface are proposed...|$|E
