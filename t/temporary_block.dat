2500|$|Subsequent to {{an order}} from the Lahore High Court on May 19, 2010, the {{government}} of Pakistan, through its agency the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), indefinitely banned Facebook in the country, {{in response to the}} impending May 20 date at the focus of the protest movement. The order to carry out the shut down of Facebook in Pakistan was given by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, which also publicized an email address and phone number and requested individuals contact the agency to let them know about [...] "all similar URLs where such objectionable material is found". Representative Khoram Ali Mehran of the Pakistan agency stated to CNN, [...] "Obviously it (the blocking of Facebook) is related to the objectionable material that was placed on Facebook. That is why it is blocked. We have blocked it for an indefinite amount of time. We are just following the government's instructions and the ruling of the Lahore High Court. If the government decides to unblock it then that's what we will do." [...] The agency was responding to an action by a group of Islamic attorneys based in Pakistan, who had acted to get the court order due to a Facebook group [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammad Day—May 20". Azhar Siddique had filed the petition to the Lahore High Court on behalf of the organization, the Islamic Lawyers Forum. The government faced pressure from public protests against Facebook. In its petition to the government, the Islamic Lawyers Forum described the [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" [...] event as [...] "blasphemous". Siddique told The Times, [...] "The court has also ordered the foreign ministry to investigate why such a competition is being held." [...] The lawyers succeeded in getting the government to block the Facebook group itself individually on May 18, but the Islamic lawyers requested a full block of the entirety of the Facebook site, because the organization had permitted the posting of the particular group on its site. They argued that unless the entire Facebook website were blocked, {{it would be difficult to}} stop the protest movement campaign on the site. The Lahore court carried out this request, and ordered the government to issue a <b>temporary</b> <b>block</b> on Facebook to stand until May 31, 2010. Justice Ejaz Chaudhry of the Lahore High Court issued the ruling of the court. The court's ruling determined that the content of the protest movement on Facebook would damage the religious beliefs of the 45million users of the website in Pakistan. The force of the ban was effective immediately after the ruling of the court. Those present for the court's ruling included many religious clerics, attorneys, and students. The court held an in-depth hearing on the matter on May 31, 2010.|$|E

50|$|Where glacial {{movement}} <b>temporary</b> <b>blocks</b> riverflows, downstream {{areas may}} {{be threatened by}} GLOFs.

Significant GLOFs occurred in 1957, 1960, 1968 and 1994, devastating lives and property downstream.

50|$|Glaciers in {{northern}} Bhutan, which covered about 10 {{percent of the}} total surface area in the 1980s, are an important renewable source of water for Bhutan's rivers.
