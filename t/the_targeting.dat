5|$|Commander T'Pol and Commander Tucker remain captives of Paxton, who {{continues}} to broadcast his demand on all channels and frequencies. Paxton's action has an unsettling effect on the interspecies conference since {{it is clear that}} not all humans support it. On Mars, Paxton allows T'Pol and Tucker see the baby, and T'Pol uses her scanner to learn that the child is unwell (and that Paxton has been using Rigelian gene therapy to treat himself). Seeking to fine-tune their attack, Paxton then threatens T'Pol to force Tucker to optimize <b>the</b> <b>targeting</b> system of the array.|$|E
5|$|The Victor was a futuristic-looking, {{streamlined}} aircraft, {{with four}} turbojet (later turbofan) engines {{buried in the}} thick wing roots. Distinguishing features of the Victor were its highly swept T-tail with considerable dihedral on the tail planes, and a prominent chin bulge that contained <b>the</b> <b>targeting</b> radar, cockpit, nose landing gear unit and an auxiliary bomb aimer's position. It was originally required by the specification that the whole nose section could be detached at high altitudes {{to act as an}} escape pod, but the Air Ministry abandoned this demand in 1950.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} salvo from the 15cm {{batteries}} in Drøbak, the steering {{from the bridge}} was disabled. Blücher had just passed Drøbakgrunnen (Drøbak shallows) and was in a turn to port. The commander got her back on track by using the side shafts, but she lost speed. Normally the rudder is controlled electrically from the bridge to the motors forward of the Handsteuerraum (hand steering room) deep under the armored deck, forward of the rudder. In an emergency it can be switched within seconds to manual steering, but orders from the bridge to the rudder may be delayed. At 04:34 Norwegian land-based torpedo batteries scored two hits on the ship. <b>The</b> <b>targeting</b> device in the torpedo battery was very primitive. The speed of the torpedo was known and set, but {{the speed of the}} target had to be adjusted by dead reckoning (guessing).|$|E
30|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>target</b> {{detection}} probability drop, {{targets are}} sometimes localized and sometimes not. Depending {{on the length}} of the continuous time interval within which <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is localized, <b>the</b> MTT will create and maintain <b>the</b> <b>target</b> tracks. If <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is localized rarely, then <b>the</b> <b>target</b> tracks will not be created or will disappear.|$|R
5000|$|For moving <b>targets,</b> <b>the</b> point-of-aim {{is ahead}} of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> in <b>the</b> {{direction}} of movement. Known as [...] "leading" [...] <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> <b>the</b> amount of [...] "lead" [...] depends on the speed and angle of <b>the</b> <b>target's</b> movement {{as well as the}} distance to <b>the</b> <b>target.</b> For this technique, holding over is the preferred method. Anticipating the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is necessary to accurately place the shot.|$|R
30|$|To sum up, the {{infrared}} radiation of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is very complex, which {{is because the}} factors affecting {{the infrared}} radiation of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> are multifaceted, including the radiation of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> surface, <b>the</b> absorption and reflectivity of <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> <b>the</b> climate conditions, the selective absorption and scattering of the atmosphere, the atmospheric scintillation, the velocity of <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> <b>the</b> surface coating and heat insulation, {{the noise of the}} circuit, and so on.|$|R
5|$|As {{the project}} neared its conclusion, American {{planners}} began {{to consider the}} use of the bomb. Groves formed a committee that met in April and May 1945 to draw up a list of targets. One of the primary criteria was that the target cities must not have been damaged by conventional bombing. This would allow for an accurate assessment of the damage done by the atomic bomb. <b>The</b> <b>targeting</b> committee's list included 18 Japanese cities. At {{the top of the list}} were Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Kokura, and Niigata. Ultimately, Kyoto was removed from the list at the insistence of Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who had visited the city on his honeymoon and knew of its cultural and historical significance.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Rico pins Panay to {{the exposed}} {{core of the}} U.S.-bound missile, and reprograms <b>the</b> <b>targeting</b> {{computer}} before jumping to safety. The missile changes course and explodes over Panau's oilfields, killing Panay and destroying the island's oil reserves. Rico rejoins Sheldon, Kane and Jade, who are dismayed {{at the loss of}} billions of dollars' worth of oil. Rico explains that oil is not worth dying for; with its oil gone, interest in Panau will be lost, the superpowers will not war and the island's residents will be spared. Sheldon agrees, assuring Rico that a president friendly to the U.S. will be installed on Panau and the island will be closely monitored; the group raise their glasses, toasting friendship and a job well done.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{moved on}} to the Hawker Fury on 21 March 1939. On 23 June, he was classed as average again, but with low marks—2,010 out of 3,400—just 59 percent. Pilot ability was {{assessed}} as 400 out of 750; officer qualities 450 of 750; and in the written exams 837 of 1,300. Examined in navigation, meteorology, engine mechanics and armament, he achieved marks of 77, 54, 50 and 65 percent. At this time, he flew radio-controlled aircraft for <b>the</b> <b>Targeting</b> Section. On 10 July, he crashed a Queen bee on a transport flight to Gosport in bad weather, which did not improve his standing as a pilot. He escaped with a cut thumb. On 29 August, he was re-graded as a pilot officer (on probation), with the service number 41276.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>target</b> is 15 points. In {{the case}} {{of two or more}} players {{reaching}} <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> <b>the</b> bidder is the winner. Otherwise, the first player to reach <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is <b>the</b> winner.|$|R
30|$|However, frames {{occasionally}} {{occurred in}} which no target was identified despite <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> presence, 92 % (55 frames) of which were caused by occlusion. Due to estimation errors regarding <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> position, in 23 frames, dis-identification occurred after occlusion. In each frame, <b>the</b> <b>target</b> was regarded not as <b>the</b> <b>target</b> but as <b>the</b> other candidate, and associated across frames. It is impossible to estimate <b>the</b> <b>target</b> position correctly during long-term occlusion. Therefore, a recovery method is required that will help with re-identification whenever <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is lost.|$|R
30|$|In this work, the {{detection}} performance of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> echo from CW ping signals is enhanced {{in the presence}} of reverberations. To this end, a reverberation suppression algorithm is proposed based on NMF and distinguishing characteristics between <b>the</b> <b>target</b> echo and reverberations. Specifically, three characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> are considered: <b>the</b> frequency structure of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> echo {{is similar to that of}} the Doppler-shifted transmitted signal, <b>the</b> <b>target</b> echo has time-continuous values, and <b>the</b> <b>target</b> echo has relatively short and finite duration. To use these characteristics, the frequency bases of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> echo are fixed by frequency-shifted transmitted pings, and constraints on the temporal continuity and TLL are developed.|$|R
5|$|Gunfights {{are a major}} {{gameplay}} mechanic in Red Dead Redemption. The {{player can}} take cover, target a specific person or animal, blindfire, and free aim. Individual body parts can also be targeted, {{in order to take}} targets down non-lethally. When the player shoots an enemy, the game engine uniquely creates the AI reactions and movements depending on where they were hit. The player character can choose from period-accurate weapons including revolvers, pistols, lever or bolt-action rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, knives, explosives, lassos, mounted Gatling guns, and cannons. Duels utilize a gunslinger gameplay mechanic known as Dead Eye. Dead Eye is a targeting system that is used in a bullet time-like manner, allowing the player to slow down time to place a precise shot or paint in multiple shots. When <b>the</b> <b>targeting</b> sequence ends, Marston automatically fires to all marked locations in extremely quick succession.|$|E
5|$|In plants, {{signaling}} by auxins, or phytohormones {{that order}} {{the direction and}} tropism of plant growth, induces <b>the</b> <b>targeting</b> of a class of transcription factor repressors known as Aux/IAA proteins for proteasomal degradation. These proteins are ubiquitinated by SCFTIR1, or SCF in complex with the auxin receptor TIR1. Degradation of Aux/IAA proteins derepresses transcription factors in the auxin-response factor (ARF) family and induces ARF-directed gene expression. The cellular consequences of ARF activation depend on the plant type and developmental stage, but are involved in directing growth in roots and leaf veins. The specific response to ARF derepression {{is thought to be}} mediated by specificity in the pairing of individual ARF and Aux/IAA proteins.|$|E
5|$|Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter with shoot 'em up and action-adventure elements, {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the player character from a third-person perspective in a 3D environment. The game places strong emphasis on shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. Weapons have no magazines restrictions and range from grenades to a pistol, a machine gun, a sniper rifle, a flamethrower, and rocket launchers, among others. Although much {{of the game is}} spent in battle, the player has the ability to jump, hang from most ledges, swim and fly using jet packs when needed. In combat, the player is free to set on a manual aiming system with <b>the</b> <b>targeting</b> camera fixed behind the character's head. When using this technique, a crosshair appears on screen and the player character becomes translucent so that players can aim and shoot with finesse. By contrast, when walking around, the game plays similar to a 3D platformer.|$|E
30|$|Based on the distance/angle {{from the}} mobile camera to <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> <b>the</b> {{latitude}} and longitude of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> can be obtained. Finally, the trajectories of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> are smoothed by Kalman filtering (KF).|$|R
30|$|Taking {{into account}} <b>the</b> actual <b>target</b> in <b>the</b> {{short-time}} flight process, <b>the</b> <b>target</b> flight path {{will not have}} large sudden changes. This article uses the parabolic least square method formula to predict <b>the</b> <b>target</b> spatial position, which can effectively improve the robustness {{of the system and}} make <b>the</b> <b>target</b> lost. For a certain period of time, the device can still follow the correct trajectory to ensure that the system can still track <b>the</b> <b>target</b> correctly when <b>the</b> <b>target</b> reappears.|$|R
30|$|The {{first step}} is to obtain the {{specific}} motion equation of <b>the</b> moving <b>targets</b> after selected. Because of the continuous relative movement of the UAV and <b>the</b> <b>targets,</b> coordinates of <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> will constantly change and need to be updated in real time. In order to obtain the motion equation of <b>the</b> moving <b>targets,</b> <b>the</b> positions of <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> are obtained by radar in this paper, and the interception, tracking, track calculation, and tracking state determination of <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> are completed by radar data processing. In radar data processing, the motion trajectory of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is established through correlation and filtering processing, which effectively eliminates false detection caused by residual clutter and updates <b>the</b> <b>target</b> position.|$|R
5|$|Lead-ions (Pb), like magnesium-ions (Mg), blocks NMDA receptors. Since {{the normal}} Pb {{concentration}} in the extracellular fluid is low (adult average of 120mg), even a low increase in Pb concentration has a significant positive affect on the blockage of NMDA-receptors. Therefore, an increase in Pb concentration, will, effectively, inhibit ongoing long-term potentiations (LTPs), and lead to an abnormal increase long-term depression (LDPs) on neurons on the effected parts of the nervous system. These abnormalities lead to the indirect downregulation of NMDA-receptors, effectively initiating a positive feedback-loop for LDP. <b>The</b> <b>targeting</b> of NMDA receptors {{is thought to be}} one of the main causes for lead's toxicity to neurons.|$|E
5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to take up foreign dsRNA and use it in the RNAi pathway. The effects of RNA {{interference}} can be both systemic and heritable in plants and C. elegans, although not in Drosophila or mammals. In plants, RNAi is thought to propagate by the transfer of siRNAs between cells through plasmodesmata (channels in the cell walls that enable communication and transport). Heritability comes from methylation of promoters targeted by RNAi; the new methylation pattern is copied in each new generation of the cell. A broad general distinction between plants and animals lies in <b>the</b> <b>targeting</b> of endogenously produced miRNAs; in plants, miRNAs are usually perfectly or nearly perfectly complementary to their target genes and induce direct mRNA cleavage by RISC, while animals' miRNAs tend to be more divergent in sequence and induce translational repression. This translational effect may be produced by inhibiting the interactions of translation initiation factors with the messenger RNA's polyadenine tail.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchase}} of new AN/APG-73 radars was announced on 17 August 1998. The Commonwealth accepted a United States Foreign Military Sales case in October 1999, {{and then the}} prototype modification commenced on 21 August 2001. The first production modified aircraft was completed in August 2002 and the last aircraft was completed on 27 August 2003. Phase 2.2, the Multi-purpose Display Group Upgrade (MDGU) and the remaining equipment will be installed in the 2006/2007 time frame. Phase 2.3, various systems, from BAE Systems, SAAB, and Elta has not been announced.

50|$|The collimator's distant {{virtual image}} of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> subtends a certain angle, {{referred}} to as the angular extent of <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> that depends on the collimator focal length and <b>the</b> <b>target</b> size.

When Volkoff asks his daughter to release him, she refuses, feeling deceived and abandoned by him. She takes the thorium and leaves everyone in the vault with armed plasma bombs which Volkoff deactivates with a portable EMP generator. At Castle, Volkoff says goodbye to Mary before being returned to custody.|$|E
5|$|Warfare on the North American {{frontier}} was brutal, and {{the killing}} of prisoners, <b>the</b> <b>targeting</b> of civilians, and other atrocities were widespread. The ruthlessness and treachery of the conflict was {{a reflection of a}} growing divide between the separate populations of the British colonists and Native Americans. Contrary to popular belief, the British government did not issue the Royal Proclamation of 1763 in reaction to Pontiac's War, though the conflict did provide an impetus for the application of the Proclamation's Indian clauses. This proved unpopular with British colonists, and may {{have been one of the}} early contributing factors to the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Minas Geraes was christened by Senhora Regis de Oliveira, {{the wife}} of the Brazilian {{minister}} to Great Britain, and launched at Newcastle-on-Tyne on 10 September 1908. During fitting-out, it was moved to Vickers' Walker Yard, and thousands turned out to see the incomplete ship squeeze barely underneath and through overhead and swing bridges. After completion, Minas Geraes was handed over by Armstrong on 5 January to the Brazilian Commission on behalf of the Brazilian government, while the ship's company was mustered on deck. The British Royal Navy carried out its gunnery trials at the request of Armstrong's and with the agreement of the Brazilian government. Although the idea of having superfiring turrets was not new—the American s were also designed and built in this fashion around the same time—the trials attracted interest from a few nations, who sent representatives to observe. They wanted to resolve two major questions: the effect that firing the upper superfiring turrets would have on the crewmen in the lower guns, and whether smoke from the discharge of the lower guns would hinder <b>the</b> <b>targeting</b> capabilities of the upper turret. The tests resolved both questions satisfactorily.|$|E

They help Scotty (voiced by Simon Pegg) and Keenser reactivate the warp core, and restore power to sickbay so McCoy can replicate more of the antidote for airborne dispersal. The duo head to the bridge where the Henchman is holding Uhura (voiced by Zoe Saldana) hostage, demanding Kirk give them control of the ship. Kirk responds by directing their shuttle to crash into the view-screen, decompressing the Gorn into space. With only an hour before the Rip closes, Kirk and Spock space dive to the Gorn Commander's ship, where they disable <b>the</b> <b>targeting</b> platform to give Enterprise a fighting chance, and enter the core where T'Mar and the device are being held. Kirk and Spock destroy the device, defeat the Commander, and are beamed back to Enterprise with T'Mar.
