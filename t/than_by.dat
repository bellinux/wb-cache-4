5|$|A 2012 {{study on}} the effects of {{rainfall}} patterns and parasite infections on the body of the springbok in Etosha National Park observed that males and juveniles were in better health {{toward the end of the}} rainy season. Health of females was more affected by parasites <b>than</b> <b>by</b> rainfall; parasite count in females peaked prior to and immediately after parturition. Studies show that springbok host helminths (Haemonchus, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus), ixodid ticks (Rhipicephalus species), lice (Damalinia and Linognathus species). Eimeria species mainly affect juveniles.|$|E

For the case of c 3.f 3, the area, which is computed by AASEE, is less <b>than</b> that <b>by</b> AATRE and AACHA, and the percentage area saving of AASEE over AATRE is from 14.34 % to 5.62 % with the target precision increased.|$|R
5|$|After trucks {{became popular}} in the 1910s, the Omaha Stockyards grew exponentially. Cattle, hogs and sheep were shipped cheaper by truck <b>than</b> <b>by</b> trains. In 1919 27% of {{livestock}} at the Stockyards was shipped by truck; by 1940's it rose to over 75%. In 1955 the Stockyards became the biggest livestock distribution center in the United States, {{and almost all of}} the cattle was shipped by truck.|$|E
5|$|Another {{trend in}} {{contemporary}} Danish architecture is {{the emergence of}} a new generation of successful young practices, inspired more by international trends <b>than</b> <b>by</b> the modernist tradition in Scandinavia. The generation is spearheaded by Bjarke Ingels whose firm BIG (Bjarke Ingels Group) founded in 2006 has made an unusually rapid transition into a well-established firm.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have two}} sexes: either female or male. The sex of birds is {{determined}} by the Z and W sex chromosomes, rather <b>than</b> <b>by</b> the X and Y chromosomes present in mammals. Male birds have two Z chromosomes (ZZ), and female birds have a W chromosome and a Z chromosome (WZ).|$|E

5|$|Debt service {{funds are}} used to account for money {{that will be used}} to pay the {{interest}} and principal of long-term debts. Bonds used by a government to finance major construction projects, to be paid by tax levies over a period of years, require a debt service fund to account for their repayment. The debts of permanent and proprietary funds are serviced within those funds, rather <b>than</b> <b>by</b> a separate debt service fund.|$|E
5|$|During the {{petition}} drive, national organizations {{on both the}} gun rights and gun control sides became involved by providing mailings and donations. Once {{the petition}}s were submitted, Morse and Giron challenged the effort in court, but were denied the injunction that they had requested from the court. A further court hearing resulted in the election being conducted in-person rather <b>than</b> <b>by</b> mail, which also led to Giron complaining of voter suppression.|$|E
5|$|Extracts of the puffball {{have strong}} {{antitumor}} activity in mouse models attributable to protein-bound polysaccharides, the compounds calvatan, craniformin, and a tautomer of rubroflavin. Calvatan {{is thought to}} act by stimulating the immune response, rather <b>than</b> <b>by</b> killing cells. Craniformin, originally reported in 1997, is an azoformamide compound. Three sterol compounds have been identified from the fungus: ergosta-4,6,8(14), 22-tetraene-3-one, ergosta-7,22-diene-3-ol, and ergosterol peroxide.|$|E

5|$|Francium was {{discovered}} by Marguerite Perey in France (from which the element takes its name) in 1939. It was the last element first discovered in nature, rather <b>than</b> <b>by</b> synthesis. Outside the laboratory, francium is extremely rare, with trace amounts found in uranium and thorium ores, where the isotope francium-223 continually forms and decays. As little as 20–30g (one ounce) exists {{at any given time}} throughout the Earth's crust; the other isotopes (except for francium-221) are entirely synthetic. The largest amount produced in the laboratory was a cluster of more than 300,000 atoms.|$|E
5|$|However, even {{following}} Romanum decet pontificem, {{only three}} of the eight Popes of the 18th century failed to make a nephew or brother cardinal. The College of Cardinals apparently preferred rule by nephews <b>than</b> <b>by</b> favorites, which they perceived as the alternative; for example, the College urged Pope Benedict XIII (1724–1730) to appoint a cardinal-nephew, who they hoped would replace Benedict XIII's notorious lieutenant Niccolò Coscia. Pope Gregory XIII (1572–1585) also had to be urged by key figures in the College to appoint his cardinal-nephew: Filippo Boncompagni.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, Venera 4 found Venus's {{magnetic}} field {{to be much}} weaker than that of Earth.

Venus's small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation.|$|E
5|$|In Reformed theology, the Lord's Supper or Eucharist is {{a sacrament}} that spiritually nourishes Christians and {{strengthens}} their union with Christ. The outward or physical {{action of the}} sacrament is eating bread and drinking wine. Reformed confessions, which are official statements of the beliefs of Reformed churches, teach that Christ's body and blood are really present in the sacrament, but that this presence is communicated in a spiritual manner rather <b>than</b> <b>by</b> his body being physically eaten. The Reformed doctrine of real presence is sometimes called mystical real presence or spiritual real presence.|$|E

5|$|In pre-contact times, natives {{traveling}} up Mauna Kea {{were probably}} guided more by landscape <b>than</b> <b>by</b> existing trails, as {{no evidence of}} the latter has been found. It is possible that natural ridges and water sources were followed instead. Individuals likely took trips up Mauna Kea's slopes to visit family-maintained shrines near its summit, and traditions related to ascending the mountain exist to this day. However, very few natives actually reached the summit, because of the strict kapu placed on it.|$|E

He can be treacherous and survives mostly by using wit and {{negotiation}} rather <b>than</b> <b>by</b> force, opting to flee most dangerous situations and to fight only when necessary. Sparrow is introduced seeking to regain his ship, the Black Pearl, from his mutinous first mate, Hector Barbossa.
