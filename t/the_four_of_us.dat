In the old days we'd have the biggest hotel suites, the whole floor of the hotel, and <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would end up in the bathroom, just to be with each other". He added, [...] "there were some really loving, caring moments between four people: a hotel room here and there – a really amazing closeness. Just four guys who loved each other. It was pretty sensational." ...|$|E
500|$|Each of {{the band}} members were in other bands prior to Delorentos, {{sometimes}} playing together, in what Conlan once described as [...] "a weird web of bands through schools and colleges, until <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> came together". McGuinness started playing with McCormick's school band around 1999, with Conlan joining the band soon after that. After this band failed, McCormick played with Yourell for a while, with McCormick and Conlan having played in a band together as well. Yourell then worked in France for a time but later returned to Ireland. Eventually the four grouped together to form Delorentos, whose name was taken from an older band in which {{a number of them}} featured. They were, by their own admission, [...] "shite" [...] until they went to Chicago to play [...] "a rake of gigs". McCormick and Conlan were in college in the earlier days {{of the band}}'s career.|$|E
500|$|Shearer {{said in an}} {{interview}} that [...] "The animating impulse was to do rock 'n' roll right. <b>The</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had been around rock 'n' roll and we were just amazed by how relentlessly the movies got it wrong. Because we were funny people it was going to be a funny film, but we wanted to get it right." [...] When they tried to sell it to various Hollywood studios, they were told that the film would not work. The group kept saying, [...] "No, this is a story that's pretty familiar to people. We're not introducing them to anything they don't really know," [...] so Shearer thought it would at least have some resonance with the public. The film was only a modest success upon its initial release but found greater success, and a cult following, after its video release. In 2000, the film was ranked 29th on the American Film Institute's list of the top 100 comedy movies in American cinema and it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".|$|E

500|$|... "Four Rusted Horses" [...] is a blues-inspired rock song, and was {{compared}} {{to the work of}} The Doors and Johnny Cash. Manson described its lyric as being [...] "almost a nursery rhyme. [...] everyone thinks that I was singing about the apocalypse, but it's more just about <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> my band, that managed to survive through all of this, and {{where do we go from}} here." [...] "Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon" [...] is an uptempo rock song which was described by The Quietus as [...] "classic Manson". Caren Gibson of Metal Hammer claimed that the song was reminiscent of [...] "Chain Reaction" [...] by Diana Ross, as well as the work of Depeche Mode. [...] "Blank and White" [...] deals with censorship, specifically the reaction to Time magazine's cover story [...] "Is God Dead?", which saw protesters brandishing blank picket signs. The lyric [...] "God is dead but god is still white / So shoot up the mall, the school or the president of whatever / Or whoever wants a fight" [...] was censored by Interscope on all editions of the album. Manson has said that this made him happy artistically, as [...] "the song is about censorship, and they censored [...]" ...|$|E

The first couple shows we did before we knew Dan , we did with three of us {{and they kind of}} sucked. From the get-go, when we were trying to put together a live show, that's when we discovered our sound and that's why I think {{that was the beginning of}} the band." ...|$|E

It’ll take some time to come together and everything. To do that, we’d have to, the way <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are, we would take quite some time, I think, re-associating ourselves musically, and then just letting it come about naturally, because it would have to be a natural thing. So we’ll just see." ...|$|E
2500|$|Garbage {{completed}} recording by December 1997, as Manson {{wanted to}} return to her family in Scotland for Christmas, and asked her bandmates to just move onto the mixing. Vig added that otherwise more time would be spent recording, and [...] "it was kind of scary—because we had to commit to what these songs were going to become." [...] Production was done until mid-February 1998. The eventual title, Version 2.0, was a tongue-in-cheek take on how computers were heavily involved in the album's production, with Manson adding that [...] "in the studio, at any given moment, someone would come in and find <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> in front of the screen." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ashcroft {{had been}} adamant that the Verve would not re-form, once remarking: [...] "You're {{more likely to}} get all four Beatles on stage". However, after Ashcroft learned that Salisbury was in contact with McCabe over a {{possible}} side project, Ashcroft contacted McCabe and Jones, making peace with them, and the band re-formed. Tong was not asked to rejoin, so as to keep the internal issues that split the band up a decade ago to an absolute minimum. Jones explained this decision by stating: [...] "It would have been too hard, it's hard enough for <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> If you bring more people to it, it's harder to communicate and communication has always been our difficulty". On 26 June 2007, the band's reunion was announced by Jo Whiley on BBC Radio 1. The band, reuniting in their original line-up, announced they would tour in November 2007, and release an album in 2008. The band stated: [...] "We are getting back together for the joy of music", though they turned down a multi-album deal offer [...] "because the 'treadmill' of releasing albums and touring {{marked the beginning of the}} end for the band a decade ago".|$|E
2500|$|The {{first of}} The Tops' albums under their new Motown {{contract}} was Back Where I Belong. A whole {{side of the}} album was produced by the Holland-Dozier-Holland, including the R Top 40 single, [...] "I Just Can't Walk Away". Only one more Tops album would be released by Motown, Magic in 1985. The lead single from that album, [...] "Sexy Ways", was almost a Top 20 R hit, peaking at #21 on the Soul Charts in mid-1985. In July of that year, the group performed at the Live Aid concert, singing three of their hit songs. [...] The album Hot Nights was completed in 1986, but was then cancelled, as the group and the Motown label began to disagree over marketing and musical direction. The following year, the Four Tops decided to leave for Arista Records, buying back several masters they had recorded for Hot Nights. It's not clear how many songs from Hot Nights were used on Indestructible, but the 2001 box set, Fourever includes the title track (previously released as a single), Red Hot Love and <b>The</b> <b>Four</b> <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> (previously released outside the U.S. on a CD single of [...] "Loco in Acapulco"), as well as Indestructible.|$|E
2500|$|However, in a January 28, 2009 {{interview}} with MTV News, Richard {{announced that the}} group had split up. Richard explained that Combs had invited all the women {{to come back to}} the 2009 season of Making the Band and that only two of them, Richard and Fimbres, showed up. [...] "It changes [...] completely," [...] she said. [...] "We have fans out there who love Danity Kane. We love Danity Kane. It's hard. We're sitting here trying to make sense of it now. It's hard. We're put in this position that we didn't ask to be in and we're being told to fix it." [...] On the series and in an earlier interview, Bex had explicitly stated her discontent about Danity Kane being divided. [...] "I don't know why ," [...] said Richard. [...] "I think she's just happy. I don't want to even try to answer it 'cause that's not fair to her. I haven't [...] but I heard she's doing well with her husband and she got a house. I love her, but I don't know." [...] Richard was surprised that only two members showed up for another season. [...] "The thing about it ... I thought we were all going to come back and talk, or maybe if [...] didn't come back, 'cause I don't know how [...] was feeling about that, if <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> got together.

2500|$|On July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker {{announced}} via the band's {{official website}} {{that the two}} were leaving the band. The statement, in part, read: [...] "Ryan Ross and Jon Walker will be leaving Panic at the Disco {{to embark on a}} musical excursion of their own. Though <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have made music together in the past, we’ve creatively evolved in different directions which has compromised what each of us want to personally achieve. Over the years, we have remained close and honest with each other, which helped us to realize that our goals were different and that parting ways is truly what is best for each of us." [...] In an interview following the split, Ross explained that he first brought the idea to Smith in late June 2009 over lunch: [...] "Spencer and I had lunch and caught up for a while, and then the big question came up, like, 'Well, {{what do you want to}} do?' and I said, 'Well, I think it might be best if we kind of do our own thing for a while,' and he said, 'I'm glad you said that, because I was going to say the same thing,' [...] " [...] Ross recalled. [...] "And there was really no argument, which is really the best way that could've worked out." [...] Ross said the split was largely due to creative differences between him and Urie. Urie wanted the band to explore a more polished pop sound, while Ross — and, by extension, Walker — was interested in making retro-inspired rock.|$|E
