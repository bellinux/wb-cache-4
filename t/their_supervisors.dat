5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, gay men and lesbians were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon <b>their</b> <b>supervisors</b> learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable to see themselves as part of the same community with gay men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, gay men and lesbians united to work together on the campaign.|$|E
25|$|The superior–subordinate {{relationship}} {{is an important}} relational factor. Employees who perceive they have a higher-quality relationship with <b>their</b> <b>supervisors</b> are more often to use articulated dissent. They feel <b>their</b> <b>supervisors</b> respect their opinions {{and that they have}} mutual influence and persuasion over the outcome of organizational decisions. Conversely, employees that perceive their relationship with their supervisor as low-quality will resort to latent dissent. They feel that there is no room to voice their opinions (Kassing, 2000).|$|E
25|$|The {{process that}} IOS used to design their {{test for the}} job {{analyses}} portion included interviews of incumbent captains and lieutenants and <b>their</b> <b>supervisors,</b> and ride-along observations of other on-duty officers.

40|$|How {{employees}} of nonprofit organizations are motivated and satisfied {{may still be}} unclear. If the nonprofit environment attracts different employees than for-profits, {{is it safe to}} view motivation the same? The impact of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation and supervisor style is examined in several nonprofit social service organizations. Surprising results indicate that intrinsically motivated employees were the least satisfied but {{were more likely to be}} able to clearly describe <b>their</b> <b>supervisor’s</b> style, while extrinsically motivated employees were more satisfied with <b>their</b> <b>supervisor</b> regardless of style...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the use of social {{networking}} (Facebook) among nurse anesthetists.

25|$|Kassing (2001) {{found that}} {{articulated}} and latent dissenters were perceived differently. People perceived articulated dissenters {{to be more}} satisfied, more committed, possess higher quality relationships with <b>their</b> <b>supervisors,</b> and seen as employees who believed they have influence within their organizations than latent dissenters. Furthermore, articulated dissenters, compared to latent dissenters, were perceived to be less verbally aggressive.|$|E
25|$|After the South Tower collapsed, FDNY commanders issued {{orders for}} firefighters in the North Tower to evacuate. Due to radio {{communications}} problems, firefighters inside the towers {{did not hear}} the evacuation order from <b>their</b> <b>supervisors</b> on the scene, and most were unaware that the other tower had collapsed. 343 firefighters died in the Twin Towers, {{as a result of}} the collapse of the buildings. No one was able to escape the North Tower from the impact zone or above, as all stairwells and elevator shafts on those floors were destroyed or blocked.|$|E
25|$|Management which models {{the use of}} {{articulated}} dissent {{contributes to}} the use of articulated dissent among its employees (Kassing & Avtgis, 1999). Subordinates who witness <b>their</b> <b>supervisors</b> successfully articulating dissent may be more likely and more willing to adopt similar strategies. However, a supervisor must keep in mind that expressing dissent can be very difficult and uncomfortable for lower-level managers and employees. Therefore, supervisors should not only take actions to encourage dissent, they must be willing to seek out individuals willing to say no to them (Roberto, 2005).|$|E
40|$|This study {{adopts a}} {{multilevel}} research design {{in order to}} illustrate the importance of supervisor’s adoption of Internal Market Orientation (IMO) for shaping positive employee consequences.

25|$|In late 2009, {{reports were}} {{released}} by the London-based human-rights group Plan International, claiming that child labor was common on Malawi (producer of 1.8% of the world's tobacco) tobacco farms. The organization interviewed 44 teens, who worked full-time on farms during the 2007-8 growing season. The child-laborers complained of low pay and long hours, {{as well as physical}} and sexual abuse by <b>their</b> <b>supervisors.</b> They also reported suffering from Green tobacco sickness, a form of nicotine poisoning. When wet leaves are handled, nicotine from the leaves gets absorbed in the skin and causes nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Children were exposed to 50-cigarettes-worth of nicotine through direct contact with tobacco leaves. This level of nicotine in children can permanently alter brain structure and function.|$|E
25|$|The women labourers were {{surprisingly}} {{important to}} the canal's engineering. Many came from former Roman bath colonies in the Pyrenees, where elements of classical hydraulics had been maintained as a living tradition. They were employed at first to move earth to the dam at Saint Ferréol, but <b>their</b> <b>supervisors,</b> who were struggling to design the channels from the dam to the canal, recognized their expertise. Engineering in this period was mainly focused on fortress construction, and hydraulics was concerned mostly with mining and problems of drainage. Building a navigational canal across the continent was well beyond the formal knowledge of the military engineers expected to supervise it, but the peasant women who were carriers of classical hydraulic methods added to the repertoire of available techniques. They not only perfected the water supply system for the canal but also threaded the waterway through the mountains near Béziers, using few locks, and built the eight-lock staircase at Fonserannes.|$|E
25|$|If an {{employee}} feels <b>their</b> immediate <b>supervisors</b> are not responsive to dissent, they may employ the circumvention strategy. This entails the employee choosing to dissent {{to an audience}} higher in the organizational hierarchy. If {{an employee}} uses this strategy before giving <b>their</b> <b>supervisor</b> they opportunity to handle the situation first, this strategy can be deemed active–destructive. However, when used to express dissent regarding unethical practices it is considered active–constructive since the dissent is issue driven.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{contribution}} of organizational support and personal relations in accounting for Chinese workers' affective commitment to the organization for which they work and their organizational citizenship behavior. In a sample of 605 matched cases of employees and <b>their</b> immediate <b>supervisors</b> from a large, reformed state-owned firm, organizational support was found to relate to affective commitment more strongly than to organizational citizenship behavior. Personal relations, however, were found to relate similarly to affective commitment and organizational citizenship behavior. Moderator effects are evident with the less-traditional Chinese employees manifesting greater citizenship behavior than do more-traditional Chinese, {{in response to a}} high-quality relationship with <b>their</b> <b>supervisor.</b> More-traditional Chinese contribute citizenship behavior that is moderately high, regardless of the quality of their relationship with <b>their</b> <b>supervisor.</b> These findings suggest a need to revise certain assumptions regarding the nature of the employee-employer exchange relationship in China and in similar transitional societies. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Past {{research}} reveals inconsistent {{findings regarding}} {{the association between}} aversive workplace conditions and absenteeism, suggesting that other, contextual factors {{may play a role}} in this association. Extending contemporary models of absence, we draw from the social identity theory of attitude–behavior relations to examine how peer absence-related norms and leader support combine to explain the effect of aversive workplace conditions on absenteeism. Using a prospective design and a random sample of transit workers, we obtained results indicating that perceived job hazards and exposure to critical incidents are positively related to subsequent absenteeism, but only under conditions of more permissive peer absence norms. Moreover, this positive impact of peer norms on absenteeism is amplified among employees perceiving <b>their</b> <b>supervisor</b> to be less supportive and is attenuated to the point of nonsignificance among those viewing <b>their</b> <b>supervisor</b> as more supportive...|$|R
