5|$|<b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> {{to permit}} uniformly {{charging}} laptops, tablets, USB-powered disks and similarly higher-power consumer electronics, {{as a natural}} extension of existing European and Chinese mobile telephone charging standards. This may also affect the way electric power used for small devices is transmitted and used in both residential and public buildings. The standard is designed to coexist with the previous USB Battery Charging specification.|$|E
5|$|The other {{significant}} {{difference is that}} the Lutheran calendar commemorates a wider variety of individuals than does either of its counterparts. Included on the calendar are musicians and artists who are associated with the Church, but are not typically thought of as “saints” in the classical sense. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> to provide a wider venue for commemoration of outstanding individuals who have served the Church through their vocations rather than simply commemorating the outstanding among the religious.|$|E
25|$|The descendents build private altars, {{containing}} the favorite foods and beverages, {{as well as}} photos and memorabilia, of the departed. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> to encourage visits by the souls, so that the souls will hear the prayers and the comments of the living directed to them.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to satirize {{perceived}} American {{ignorance of}} Canada {{and the rest}} of the world.|$|R
30|$|SDSS {{was cited}} {{as both a}} {{resource}} and an associated technical summary paper. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> clear so we grouped all the citations together.|$|R
50|$|Reader {{response}} critics view <b>the</b> authorial <b>intent</b> variously. In general, {{they have}} argued that <b>the</b> author's <b>intent</b> itself <b>is</b> immaterial and cannot be fully recovered. However, <b>the</b> author's <b>intent</b> will shape <b>the</b> text and limit the possible interpretations of a work. The reader's impression of <b>the</b> author's <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> a working force in interpretation, but <b>the</b> author's actual <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> not.|$|R
25|$|This {{structure}} {{allows the}} file to be parsed {{even if not}} all parts are understood. A GIF marked 87a may contain extension blocks; <b>the</b> <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> that a decoder can read and display the file without the features covered in extensions it does not understand.|$|E
25|$|As of 2013, the slipped-formed {{concrete}} cores {{that had}} been started prior to the cessation of construction works in 2008, have now been demolished to podium level. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> to provide a landscaped park area prior to further development proposals for office accommodation to be decided.|$|E
25|$|With the {{restrictions}} placed on general advertising, tobacco companies {{have moved to}} new promotions to establish new customers and maintain existing ones. For example, Altria has a strategy of growth by promotions that build brand equity through adult consumer experiences. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> to reinforce brand loyalty by building consumer communities.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to spin <b>the</b> program {{off as a}} series, but Marshall died in 1998. The {{decision}} was made to not continue production due to Marshall's death.|$|R
50|$|The LT-1 was co-developed by Andy Chiavetta, a {{composite}} parts specialist, and air racer, Darryl Greenamyer. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> {{to design a}} very simple homebuilt aircraft for first-time builders.|$|R
5000|$|Ruffin. v. Commonwealth(Virginia) (Note: {{the index}} cites this as [...] "Ruffing" [...] and an endnote states [...] "Puffin" [...] {{research}} and a best guess indicates <b>the</b> <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> [...] "Ruffin.") ...|$|R
25|$|A half-truth is a {{deceptive}} {{statement that}} includes some element of truth. The statement might be partly true, the statement may be totally true but {{only part of}} the whole truth, or it may employ some deceptive element, such as improper punctuation, or double meaning, especially if <b>the</b> <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> to deceive, evade, blame or misrepresent the truth.|$|E
25|$|People go to cemeteries to be {{with the}} souls of the {{departed}} and build private altars containing the favorite foods and beverages, as well as photos and memorabilia, of the departed. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> to encourage visits by the souls, so the souls will hear the prayers and the comments of the living directed to them. Celebrations can take a humorous tone, as celebrants remember funny events and anecdotes about the departed.|$|E
25|$|Many factors need to {{be taken}} into account when {{deciding}} which tactics to use during occupation; when the wrong decisions are made, it can lead to years (or even centuries) of continued resistance. The problems caused by continued resistance may be minimal if the conquered territory is only needed for a short-term tactical purpose, but can become extremely difficult if <b>the</b> <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> to colonize the area or hold the land indefinitely.|$|E
5000|$|In 1910, Reginald Fessenden {{invented a}} {{two-tone}} method of transmitting Morse code. Dots and dashes were replaced with different tones of equal length. [...] <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to minimize transmission time.|$|R
5000|$|The Authority {{operated}} a recreational vehicle site, [...] "Port O' Call." [...] This {{was closed and}} the tenants evicted in 2003. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to use <b>the</b> property for commercial development.|$|R
25|$|Watson {{proposed}} to Hastings that the EIC start trading opium to China, and offered Nonsuch for the purpose. China prohibited the opium trade and <b>the</b> <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to circumvent <b>the</b> Chinese authorities.|$|R
25|$|The {{response}} {{often cited}} by today's Rabbis {{when confronted by}} queries into the modern day inaction of this Mitzvah is simply that the animal is owned by a non-Jew {{at the time of}} slaughter - whereas advocates of the gifts cite this ownership status as irrelevant since <b>the</b> <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> for the kosher-consumer. A modern effort of reviving the gifts in a practical manner has been somewhat successful in recent years with senior members of the Orthodox Union indicating positive action will be implemented.|$|E
25|$|Next, {{the priest}} {{takes up the}} prosphoron of the Nine Ranks. From this loaf are taken smaller {{triangular}} particles in commemoration of the various ranks of saints. There are some differences between the Greek and the Slavic texts as to which particular saints are named, but <b>the</b> <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> {{that all of the}} saints are included. Saint John the Forerunner and the Patron Saint of the church or monastery are always named. The number nine was chosen because that is the traditional number of the ranks of angels.|$|E
25|$|Senior auction is a {{variation}} on the all-pay auction, and has a defined loser in addition to the winner. The top two bidders must pay their full final bid amounts, and only the highest wins the auction. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> to make the high bidders bid above their upper limits. In the final rounds of bidding, when the current losing party has hit their maximum bid, they are encouraged to bid over their maximum (seen as a small loss) to avoid losing their maximum bid with no return (a very large loss).|$|E
50|$|On 18 June 2009, {{all rights}} to the Brain Damage comic series were {{acquired}} by Untitled Project Productions in Brooklyn, NY. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to produce a series of half-hour animated TV shows.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to {{represent}} {{different aspects of}} the fight, including the phases of the war, the locations where fighting occurred and the branches of the armed forces and the resistance that were involved.|$|R
50|$|Decades have passed, but <b>the</b> <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> not to {{be found}} Lily too. In 1985, when the new {{increased}} likuran years of age, Budi narrowly met Razak who are elderly and infirm deck wheezing.|$|R
25|$|Cyprus and Israel {{signed an}} accord demarcating their {{maritime}} borders to facilitate offshore gas exploration. Cypriot Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou and Israel's Infrastructure Minister Uzi Landau signed the deal in Nicosia. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> {{to facilitate a}} search for mineral deposits in the east Mediterranean where huge natural gas reserves have been discovered. Turkish sources said that the Foreign Ministry had summoned Israel's Ambassador to Turkey, Gabby Levy, and expressed discontent over the agreement. Israeli energy firm Delek Group is seeking to work with Cyprus on natural gas exploration and extraction where Delek is already active.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> {{to create}} a voluntary, non-legally binding {{framework}} for international cooperation to facilitate the development, diffusion, deployment, and transfer of existing, emerging and longer term cost- effective, cleaner, more efficient technologies and practices among the Partners through concrete and substantial cooperation so as to achieve practical results; promote and create enabling environments to assist in such efforts; facilitate attainment of the Partners' respective national pollution reduction, energy security and climate change objectives; and provide a forum for exploring the Partners’ respective policy approaches relevant to addressing interlinked development, energy, environment, and climate change issues {{within the context of}} clean development goals, and for sharing experiences in developing and implementing respective national development and energy strategies.|$|E
25|$|It is the {{disagreement}} amongst {{the advocates of}} different approaches to problems or solutions which hinders the formation of any consensual strategy and the mobilization of adequate resources. That is why the Encyclopedia uses an approach that is as general and minimally structured as is feasible without losing coherence and utility. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> first to contribute to clarify the nature, extent, and interrelationships of problems and solutions. Even the distinction between problems and solutions is not always clear. For instance, housing {{an increasing number of}} people is a solution that may aggravate the problem of urban overcrowding, and the death of individuals is a problem that contributes to the solution of reducing ecological impact of overpopulation.|$|E
50|$|It {{was a form}} of dishonor {{that could}} be passed by the Roman Senate on traitors or others who brought {{discredit}} to the Roman State. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to erase <b>the</b> malefactor from history.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{recurring}} real-life historical figures in Histeria! were portrayed as caricatures of real-life celebrities from the modern era. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to make analogies to contemporary individuals {{in terms of}} personalities and attitudes.|$|R
50|$|This custom was {{characterized}} by people sprinkling water over each other in celebration. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to show your affection for the person being sprinkled, and therefore men generally {{took the lead in}} sprinkling women.|$|R
25|$|The {{campaign}} {{addresses the}} problem of patients receiving unnecessary health care, reasoning that this results in poor outcomes for the patient and could create significant waste in the United States healthcare system. To conduct the campaign, a coordinator from ABIM Foundation asks medical specialty professional organizations to make five recommendations for preventing overuse of a treatment in their field. Distributors then share this information with community groups nationwide, and the medical specialty societies disseminate it to their members. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> that patients and doctors will discuss the recommendations in these lists, believing that if patients and doctors {{communicate with each other}} more effectively when making health decisions patients will have better outcomes and the medical system itself will benefit.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, maize ears {{along with}} tobacco leaves are {{carved into the}} capitals of columns in the United States Capitol building. Maize itself is {{sometimes}} used for temporary architectural detailing when <b>the</b> <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> to celebrate the fall season, local agricultural productivity and culture. Bundles of dried maize stalks are often displayed often along with pumpkins, gourds and straw in autumnal displays outside homes and businesses. A well-known example of architectural use is the Corn Palace in Mitchell, South Dakota, which uses cobs and ears of colored maize to implement a mural design that is recycled annually. Another well known example is the Field of Corn in Dublin, Ohio, where a hundreds on concrete ears of corn lay in a grassy field.|$|E
25|$|The {{segments}} {{of each of}} the two deck spans will be retained in compression during a severe earthquake by post-tensioned internal tendons joining the extreme end caps, carried internally in cable trays. These tendons are required since the eastern end support is both much lighter than the western counterweight and the soil conditions are radically different at each end, the western end being founded in bedrock shale while the eastern end, with vertical supports driven to bedrock, is mostly contained within softer mud deposits, which respond much more actively to seismic shocks than does the shale. <b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> that the combination of the tensioned tendons and the compressive roadbed box structure will keep the two end caps in the same relative position.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to use water stored by the Ramadi Barrage and the Samarra Barrage for irrigation. However, {{evaporation}} on Lakes Habbaniyah and Tharthar led {{to reduced}} storage and high salinity, conditions unsuitable for irrigation.|$|R
50|$|In psychoanalytic criticism, the author's {{biography}} and unconscious state {{were seen as}} part of the text, and therefore <b>the</b> author's <b>intent</b> could <b>be</b> revived from a literary text—although <b>the</b> <b>intent</b> might <b>be</b> an unconscious one.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{a couple}} is {{planning}} to have an outdoor wedding, but they also reserved an indoor facility in the unlikely condition of bad weather. <b>The</b> unconditional <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> to have <b>the</b> wedding outside. <b>The</b> conditional <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> to have <b>the</b> wedding inside {{on the condition of}} bad weather.|$|R
