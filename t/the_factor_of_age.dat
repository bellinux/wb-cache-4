30|$|Prior {{theoretical}} and experimental work {{has demonstrated that}} the subject-object-verb (SOV) word order is more restricted {{and more difficult to}} process than the object-subject-verb (OSV) word order in Chinese. However, few studies have investigated the actual acceptability of non-canonical, verb-final word orders among native speakers. In this study, we conducted a paper-based survey with a group of younger adults and a group of older adults. Non-canonical sentences with and without animacy contrasts were tested with three tasks: acceptability judgement, grammaticality judgement, and subject selection. Our results have two main implications. First, contrary to previous studies, the results suggested that animate-animate-verb (AAV) sentences generally have very poor acceptability, and they may be mostly regarded as uninterpretable. Second, and importantly, we found that while a preference for OSV over SOV was observed in younger adults, it was not evident in older adults. This suggests that the preference for the OSV word order might be modulated by <b>the</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>age.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} valuable {{data on the}} acceptability of non-canonical word orders among younger and older native speakers of Mandarin Chinese. Previous theoretical and experimental studies demonstrated that OSV word order is preferred over SOV word order in Chinese. However, our results suggest that this preference for OSV can be modulated by <b>the</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> and therefore is not invariant. Specifically, whereas OSV was judged significantly more acceptable than SOV in the younger adults, the acceptability of OSV in the older adults was only neutral and did not significantly deviated from that of SOV.

On one hand, the difference can be an indication of a possible quantitative difference in the use of OSV between different age groups. On the other hand, it also seems possible that the reduced acceptability of OSV in the older adults can be associated with age-related differences in sentence processing. Future corpus-based and experimental work are required to examine the possible explanations proposed in the present study.|$|E

The present study investigates how gender, age, and cultural background account for differences in reference frame proclivity and performance in a virtual navigation task. Using an online navigation study, we recorded reaction times, error rates (confusion of turning axis), and reference frame proclivity (egocentric vs. allocentric reference frame) of 1823 participants. Reaction times significantly varied with gender and age, but were only marginally influenced by the cultural background of participants. Error rates were in line with these results and exhibited a significant influence of gender and culture, but not age. Participants??? cultural background significantly influenced reference frame selection; the majority of North-Americans preferred an allocentric strategy, while Latin-Americans preferred an egocentric navigation strategy.

The main aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether day care and sibling constellation had an effect on the theory of mind performance of young children. Thirty-six preschoolers aged 3 - 5 were tested on three false belief tasks. All three tasks involved the observation of a scenario, followed by a series of understanding and false belief questions.

The authors emphasize the key factors of firms’ demand for outsourcing R&D reveal the main barriers to the development of university-industry cooperation and their particularities for different cooperation actors.

A common prerequisite for research organizations' R&D cooperation with business is sufficient academic ranking. Business and science evaluate differently various obstacles to effective cooperation. For firms, the main problems are the inflated costs of national R&Ds, insufficient research organizations’ orientation at company needs, and low quality of developments. As for representatives of research organizations, they mention as barriers primarily the lack of companies' receptivity to innovation and inadequate information about promising developments. Businesses are more optimistic about cooperation with science if they already have a relevant experience of interaction.

As an individual attempts to disguise their own handwriting {{with the intent}} of later disclaiming it, {{there is a need to}} perform examination of handwritten documents to determine the authorship of a questioned document or detect evidence of forgery or disguise. This research proposed a microscopic and statistical examination of handwriting characteristics. Two handwriting specimens were involved which are normal and disguised handwriting specimen forms. The normal handwriting of 60 respondents were examined and classified into class characteristic (script types, letter size, slant, angularity alignment and word spacing) and individual characteristic of letters "a", "e", "g", "y", "d", "f ’, "h", "o", "E" and "D" and grapheme "th". The other set of 50 sets of handwriting were requested for comparison between disguised and normal handwritings. A statistical technique known as Pearson Chi-squared (x 2) test was performed to determine the relationship between race, gender, age, first education system, education level and occupation with the normal habits of handwriting. The results show that the handwriting can be uniquely classified. Based on the Chi-squared (x 2) value, the script types were affected by gender (x 2 = 0. 009) and age (x 2 = 0. 006). The letter size and slant were only dependent on <b>the</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> (x 2 = 0. 022) and education level (x 2 = 0. 034), respectively.

40|$|Objectives The {{purposes}} of this study were to assess the adherence to medication of hypertensive patients visiting community health stations in a rural area in Vietnam, {{to examine the relationship between}} levels of adherence and cardiovascular risk among hypertensive patients and to further understand factors influencing adherence. Methods This study is part of a prospective one-year study conducted on hypertension management in a population aged 35 to 64 years. Data on age, sex, blood pressure and blood test results were collected at baseline. Cardiovascular risk was based on the Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Model for populations in Asia. To calculate medication adherence, the number of days the drug was taken was divided by the number of days since the first day of the prescription. A threshold of 80 % was applied to differentiate between adherence and nonadherence. In-depth interviews were conducted among 18 subjects, including subjects classified as adherent and as non-adherent. Results Among 315 patients analyzed, 49. 8 % of the patients were adherent. Qualitative investigation revealed discrepancies in classification of adherence and non-adherence based on quantitative analysis and interviews. No significant difference in medication compliance between two cardiovascular disease risk groups (10 % risk) was found, also not after controlling for age, sex, and ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio at 1. 068; 95 % CI: 0. 614 to 1. 857). The odds of medication adherence in females was 1. 531 times higher than in males but the difference was not statistically significant (95 % CI: 0. 957 to 2. 448). Each one-year increase in age resulted in patients being 1. 036 times more likely to be compliant (95 % CI: 1. 002 to 1. 072).
