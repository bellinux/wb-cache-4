40|$|UnrestrictedMolecular {{mechanisms}} of neoplastic cell transformation by insoluble Nickel (Ni) compounds {{have not yet}} been elucidated, and are the subject of this work.; Epithelial cell transformant factor- 2 (Ect- 2) gene is amplified and differentially expressed between non-transformed and nickel or 3 -methylcholanthrene (MCA) -transformed 10 T 1 / 2 mouse fibroblastic cell lines leading to higher steady-state levels of Ect- 2 mRNA and protein in all transformed cells. Ect- 2 proto-oncogene catalyzes GDP exchange on Rho proteins, and regulates cytokinesis. We hypothesized there would be higher steady-state levels of microtubules in transformed cell lines. The hypothesis was tested by staining cell lines with fluorescent alpha or beta tubulin antibody and analyzed using confocal microscopy and the volocity image analysis program. Compared to the 10 T 1 / 2 cells, the average intensity of all cells stained silmutaneuosly for alpha and beta tubulin was 1. 5 - 2. 1 and 1. 1 - 2. 5 folds higher.; We identified the unknown down-regulated R 2 - 2 and R 2 - 3 gene fragments in transformed cell lines as fragments of beta centaurin- 2 and FAD synthetase genes. Beta centaurin- 2 protein regulates disassembly of microfilaments. We hypothesized there would be higher steady-state levels of microfilaments in all transformed cells. Hypothesis was tested by staining non-transformed and Ni-/MCA-transformed cell lines with phalloidin-conjugated- <b>Tetramethylrhodamine</b> B <b>isothiocyanate</b> (TRITC) against actin microfilaments, and quantitating the intensity of microfilament staining and cross-sectional area of cells. Compared to the 10 T 1 / 2 cells, we found an average intensity of 1. 7 - 2. 3 folds higher for microfilaments in all transformed cell lines, and a 1. 3 - 1. 7 fold for all transformed cells stained simultaneously, compared to non-transformed cells. Aggregation of microfilaments and a rounded or star-shaped morphology was observed for all transformed cells. All transformed cells analyzed had a cross-sectional area of 1. 9 - 2. 5 folds larger than that of non-transformed 10 T 1 / 2 cells. Neoplastic cell transformation is partly due to the amplification of the Ect- 2 gene and the simultaneous inactivation of the beta centaurin- 2 gene, leading to cytoskeletal derangements. Together, higher steady-state levels of microtubules and microfilaments leads to significant changes in cell shape, effects on gene expression and on induction and maintenance of morphological, Anchorage Independence (AI), and neoplastic cell transformations in transformed cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to reveal {{macromolecule}} uptake route (intercellular or intracellular) in the endothelial cell layer, and to examine the effect of wall shear stress on the uptake. After 48 hour exposure to shear stress, the endothelial cell layer on coverslips were incubated at 37 ℃ for 60 minutes in PBS containing <b>tetramethylrhodamine</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> conjugated albumin (TRITC-albumin). Thereafter, the uptake of albumin and the shape of endothelial cells were observed by a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). Albumin is found in intracellular region, not in intercellular region. The albumin uptake depends on imposed shear stress. At 10 dyn/cm^ 2,the albumin uptake showed a 1. 3 folds increase. The albumin uptake decreases with increasing shear stress, and minimum uptake is quarter of the control value at 60 dyn/cm^ 2. This shear dependence of uptake is an unique feature of the cell and may play a key role for the controlling mechanism of endothelial cells. rights: 社団法人日本機械学会rights: 本文データは学協会の許諾に基づきCiNiiから複製したものであるrelation：isVersionOf: [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Although {{considerable}} {{information is}} available about amylolysis rate, extent and pattern of granular starches, the underlying mechanisms of enzyme action and interactions are not fully understood, {{partly due to the}} lack of direct visualisation of enzyme binding and subsequent hydrolysis of starch granules. In the present study, α-amylase (AA) from porcine pancreas was labelled with either fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or <b>tetramethylrhodamine</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> (TRITC) fluorescent dye with maintenance of significant enzyme activity. The binding of FITC/TRITC-AA conjugate to the surface and interior of granules was studied under both non-hydrolysing (0 °C) and hydrolysing (37 °C) conditions with confocal microscopy. It was observed that enzyme binding to maize starch granules under both conditions was more homogenous compared with potato starch. Enzyme molecules appear to preferentially bind to the granules or part of granules that are more susceptible to enzymic degradation. The specificity is such that fresh enzyme added after a certain time of incubation binds at the same location as previously bound enzyme.

The present study evaluated reversing the dye label for each conjugate in the double-staining procedure, thus eliminating the need for the KP 560 filter. It also considered the possibility of shortening the counterstaining time and compared various methods for preparing antigen slides in an attempt to establish a method that increases the number of treponemes per microscopic field. The results indicate that a rhodamine-labeled class-specific anti-human globulin as a primary stain, and a fluorescein-labeled anti-treponemal globulin as a counterstain, provide an acceptable method for performing the fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption double-staining procedure.

40|$|Addition of {{lipopolysaccharide}} (LPS) to {{cells in}} the form of LPS–soluble (s) CD 14 complexes induces strong cellular responses. During this process, LPS is delivered from sCD 14 to the plasma membrane, and the cell-associated LPS is then rapidly transported to an intracellular site. This transport appears to be important for certain cellular responses to LPS, as drugs that block transport also inhibit signaling and cells from LPS-hyporesponsive C 3 H/HeJ mice fail to exhibit this transport. To identify the intracellular destination of fluorescently labeled LPS after its delivery from sCD 14 into cells, we have made simultaneous observations of different organelles using fluorescent vital dyes or probes. Endosomes, lysosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus were labeled using Texas red (TR) –dextran, LysoTracker ™ Red DND- 99, DiOC 6 (3), and boron dipyrromethane (BODIPY) –ceramide, respectively. After 30 min, LPS did not colocalize with endosomes, lysosomes, or endoplasmic reticulum in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, although some LPS-positive vesicles overlapped with the endosomal marker, fluorescent dextran.

Both the constitutive 73 -kDa protein and the stress-induced 72 -kDa protein have been purified by a two-step procedure employing DE 52 ion-exchange chromatography followed by affinity chromatography on ATP-agarose. The two proteins, present in approximately equal amounts in either the 12, 000 X g supernatant or pellet of hypotonically lysed heat-shock-treated HeLa cells, were found to copurify in relatively homogenous form.

The microinjected cells maintained at 37 degrees C showed only diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence. After heat-shock treatment of the cells, fluorescence was observed throughout the nucleus and more prominently within the nucleolus. This result is consistent with our earlier indirect immunofluorescence studies which showed a nuclear and nucleolar distribution of the endogenous 72 -kDa stress protein in heat-shock-treated mammalian cells.

IgG's isolated from immune and nonimmune rabbit sera were conjugated to <b>tetramethylrhodamine</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> and used to survey, by fluorescence microscopy, {{the distribution of the}} cognate antigens on the three different erythroid lines known to succeed each other during the life span of the mouse. In the peripheral blood of the adult, the antibodies recognized only mature erythrocytes; they did not crossreact with either platelets, monocytes, or different types of granulocytes. In the spleen of adult anemic mice, the antibodies reacted weakly with proerythroblasts and strongly with all types of erythroblasts. In enucleating erythroblasts...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Human egg is enveloped by a glycoproteinaceous matrix, zona pellucida (ZP), {{responsible}} for binding {{of the human}} spermatozoa to the egg and induction of acrosomal exocytosis in the spermatozoon bound to ZP. In the present manuscript, {{attempts have been made}} to delineate the downstream signalling components employed by human ZP to induce acrosome reaction. Methods Heat-solubilized human ZP (SIZP) was used to study the induction of acrosome reaction in capacitated human spermatozoa using <b>tetramethylrhodamine</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> conjugated Pisum sativum agglutinin (TRITC-PSA) in absence or presence of various pharmacological inhibitors. In addition, intracellular calcium ([Ca 2 +]i) levels in sperm using Fluo- 3 acetoxymethyl ester as fluorescent probe were also estimated in response to SIZP. Results SIZP induces acrosomal exocytosis in capacitated human sperm in a dose dependent manner accompanied by an increase in [Ca 2 +]i. Human SIZP mediated induction of acrosome reaction depends on extracellular Ca 2 + and involves activation of Gi protein-coupled receptor, tyrosine kinase, protein kinases A & C and phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3) - kinase. In addition, T-type voltage operated calcium channels and GABA-A receptor associated chloride (Cl-) channels play an important role in SIZP mediated induction of acrosome reaction. Conclusions Results described in the present study provide a comprehensive account of the various downstream signalling components associated with human ZP mediated acrosome reaction. </p...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the association of}} calmodulin (CaM) with microtubules (MTs) in the mitotic apparatus (MA), the distributions of CaM and tubulin were examined in cells in which the normal spindle organization had been altered. A fluorescent CaM conjugate with <b>tetramethylrhodamine</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> (CaM-TRITC) and a dichlorotriazinyl aminofluorescein conjugate with tubulin (tubulin-DTAF) were injected into cells that had been treated with the MT inhibitor nocodazole. With moderate nocodazole concentration (0. 3 Μg/ml, 37 °C, 4 h) in live cells, CaM-TRITC and tubulin-DTAF concentrated identically {{on or near the}} centrosomes and kinetochores. In serial sections of these cells, small MT segments were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in the regions where fluorescent protein had concentrated. When a higher drug concentration was used (3. 0 Μg/ml, 37 °C, 4 h), no regions of CaM-TRITC or tubulin-DTAF localization were observed, and no MTs were observed when serial sections were examined by TEM. However, following release from the high-concentration nocodazole block, CaM-TRITC colocalized with newly formed MTs at the kinetochores and centrosomes. Later in the recovery period, when chromosome-to-pole fibers had formed, CaM association with kinetochores diminished, ultimately attaining its normal pole-proximal association with kinetochore MTs in cells that progressed through mitosis. We interpret these observations as supporting the hypothesis that in the MA, CaM attains a physical association with kinetochore MTs and suggest that CaM-associated MTs may be inherently more stable...|$|E
40|$|Two Salmonella hybrid strains, SL 5313 (Salmonella typhimurium with a D. rfb+ gene cluster) and SL 5396 (S. enteritidis with a B. rfb+ gene cluster), each expressing both O-antigen 4 (of {{serogroup}} B) and O-antigen 9 (of serogroup D) {{were studied}} by immunofluorescence using {{a mixture of}} O 4 -specific mouse monoclonal and O 9 -specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Bound antibodies, detected by anti-mouse antibody labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate and anti-rabbit antibody labelled with <b>tetramethylrhodamine</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> showed that more than 98 % of the bacteria expressed both the O 4 and O 9 epitopes. Phenol-water-extracted lipopolysaccharide from batch-grown cultures subjected to sugar and methylation analyses by gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry were shown to contain abequose (of the O 4 epitope) and tyvelose (of the O 9 epitope) in ratios of 1 : 1. 5 and 1 : 2. 5 for SL 5313 and SL 5396, respectively. Isolated polysaccharide chains, obtained by weak-acid hydrolysis of the lipopolysaccharides, were found to contain both O 4 and O 9 specificities in the same molecule, since polysaccharide bound to O 4 antibody attached to a solid-phase-adsorbed O 9 -specific antibody and vice versa. This demonstrates that in strains SL 5313 and SL 5396 O chains containing both O 4 repeating units (from S. typhimurium) and O 9 units (from S. enteritidis) are present...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to reveal (1) the energy {{dependence}} of albumin uptake into endothelial cells, and (2) the effect of shear stress on the albumin uptake area and the its content per unit area. The uptake of the fluorescent labeled albumin (<b>tetramethylrhodamine</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> conjugated albumin, TRITC-albumin) was visualized with a confocal laser scanning microscope. The uptake into the endothelial cells is inhibited completely at 4 ℃ or by 1 μM FCCP, that is a potent energy metabolism inhibitor. This result indicates that the albumin uptake is an energy-dependent, active transport. After 48 hour exposure to shear stress to the endothelial cells, the albumin uptake area and the albumin content per unit area were changed. At 10 dyn/cm^ 2,at 5 μm the uptake area increases by 363 % and the albumin content per unit area increases by 192 %. At 60 dyn/cm^ 2,at 3 μm the uptake area decreases by 21 % and the albumin content per unit area decreases by 54 %. It is, therefore, considered that the effect of shear stress on the uptake area is more influential than that on the albumin content per unit area. We conclude that endothelial cells affected by sher stress change the albumin uptake function and especially the cells change the uptake area. rights: 社団法人日本機械学会rights: 本文データは学協会の許諾に基づきCiNiiから複製したものであるrelation：isVersionOf: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|When freshly starved amoebae of Dictyostelium discoideum {{are loaded}} with the Ca 2 +-specific dye indo- 1 /AM and {{analyzed}} in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter, they exhibit a quasi-bimodal distribution of fluorescence. This permits a separation of the population into two classes: H, or ''high Ca 2 +-indo- 1 fluorescence,'' and L, or ''low Ca 2 +-indo- 1 fluorescence. '' Simultaneous monitoring of Ca 2 +-indo- 1 and Ca 2 +-chlortetracycline fluorescence shows that by and large the same cells tend to have high (or low) levels of both cytoplasmic and sequestered Ca 2 +. Next we label H cells with <b>tetramethylrhodamine</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> (TRITC) and mix them in a 1 : 4 ratio with L cells, In the slugs that result, TRITC fluorescence is confined mainly to the anterior prestalk region. This implies that amoebae with relatively high Ca 2 + at the vegetative stage tend to develop into prestalk cells and those with low Ca 2 + into prespores. Polysphondylium violaceum, a cellular slime mold that does not possess prestalk and prespore cells, also does not display a Ca 2 +-dependent heterogeneity at the vegetative stage or in slugs. Finally, confirming earlier findings with the fluorophore fura- 2 (Azhar ef al., Curr. Sci. 68, 337 - 342 (1995)), a prestalk-prespore difference in cellular Ca 2 + {{is present in the}} cells of the slug in vivo. These findings are discussed in light of the possible roles of Ca 2 + for cell differentiation in D. discoideum...|$|E
