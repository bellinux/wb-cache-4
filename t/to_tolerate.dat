5|$|Cure {{rates in}} {{clinical}} trials have ranged from 20–45%; although clinical trials often include only younger people and those able <b>to</b> <b>tolerate</b> aggressive therapies. The overall cure rate for all people with AML (including the elderly and those unable <b>to</b> <b>tolerate</b> aggressive therapy) is likely lower. Cure rates for promyelocytic leukemia can {{be as high as}} 98%.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} animal are kept as pets, the most popular being mammals, {{especially}} dogs and cats. Plants are grown for pleasure in gardens and greenhouses, yielding flowers, shade, and decorative foliage; some, such as cactuses, able <b>to</b> <b>tolerate</b> dry conditions, are grown as houseplants.|$|E

40|$|The key {{concepts}} and techniques {{used to build}} high availability computer systems are (1) modularity, (2) fail-fast modules, (3) independent failure modes, (4) redundancy, and (5) repair. These ideas apply to hardware, to design, and to software. They also apply <b>to</b> <b>tolerating</b> operations faults and environmental faults. This article explains these ideas and assesses highavailability system trends...|$|R

5|$|Colchicine is an {{alternative}} for those unable <b>to</b> <b>tolerate</b> NSAIDs. At high doses, side effects (primarily gastrointestinal upset) limit its usage. At lower doses, which are still effective, it is well tolerated. Colchicine may interact with other commonly prescribed drugs, such as atorvastatin and erythromycin, among others.|$|E
5|$|Dromedaries {{are mainly}} active during {{daylight}} hours. They form herds of about 20 individuals, which {{are led by}} a dominant male. This camel feeds on foliage and desert vegetation; several adaptations, {{such as the ability}} <b>to</b> <b>tolerate</b> losing more than 30% of its total water content, allow it to thrive in its desert habitat. Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a gestation of 15 months.|$|E
5|$|Gastrointestinal upset {{can cause}} severe discomfort; {{it is most}} common when {{metformin}} is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7grams per day) and increasing the dose gradually but even with low doses 5% of people may be unable <b>to</b> <b>tolerate</b> metformin. Use of slow- or extended-release preparations may improve tolerability.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Instruction–level {{multithreading}} is {{an architectural}} approach <b>to</b> <b>tolerating</b> long–latency memory accesses and synchronization delays in distributed–memory systems. The paper presents a timed Petri net {{model of a}} fine–grain multithreaded distributed–memory multiprocessor system at the instruction execution level, and illustrates performance analysis by results obtained from simulation of the derived model. Performance equivalence is discussed {{in the context of}} multiprocessor systems with different interconnecting networks and different numbers of processors...|$|R
5|$|However, {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} has been demonstrated in many cases. These are usually due to a shift in coral and zooxanthellae genotypes. These shifts in allele frequency have progressed toward more tolerant types of zooxanthellae. Scientists found that a certain scleractinian zooxanthella is becoming more common where sea temperature is high. Symbionts able <b>to</b> <b>tolerate</b> warmer water seem to photosynthesise more slowly, implying an evolutionary trade-off.|$|E
5|$|Labradors are {{powerful}} and indefatigable swimmers noted {{for their ability}} <b>to</b> <b>tolerate</b> the coldest of water for extended periods of time. Their ability to work quietly alongside hunters while watching for birds to fall from the sky, marking where they land, and then using their outstanding nose to find and retrieve dead or wounded birds has made them the king of waterfowl retrievers.|$|E
5|$|Resolution of DKA {{is defined}} as general {{improvement}} in the symptoms, {{such as the ability}} <b>to</b> <b>tolerate</b> oral nutrition and fluids, normalization of blood acidity (pH>7.3), and absence of ketones in blood (<1 mmol/l) or urine. Once this has been achieved, insulin may be switched to the usual subcutaneously administrered regimen, one hour after which the intravenous administration can be discontinued.|$|E

50|$|Sinklo is {{identified}} by name in three plays by Shakespeare (an honour {{he shares with}} William Kemp). He therefore provides a strong example of Shakespeare's familiarity with the abilities and peculiarities of the cast for whom he was writing. In Sinklo’s case, it was his lean, emaciated appearance which singled him out for attention. Stanley Wells argues that he 'must have been an amiable, long-suffering man, well accustomed <b>to</b> <b>tolerating</b> jokes about his appearance'.|$|R
5|$|Some {{varieties}} of eels, {{which are a}} primary food source for banded sea kraits, may have coevolved resistance to banded sea krait venom. Gymnothorax moray eels taken from the Caribbean, where the banded sea krait is not present, died after injection with doses as small as 0.1mg/kg body weight, but Gymnothorax individuals taken from New Guinea, where banded sea kraits are endemic, were able <b>to</b> <b>tolerate</b> doses as large as 75mg/kg without severe injury.|$|E
5|$|Submarine springs found {{along the}} coast of Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula produce water with a {{naturally}} low pH (relatively high acidity) providing conditions similar to those expected to become widespread as the oceans absorb carbon dioxide. Surveys discovered multiple species of live coral that appeared <b>to</b> <b>tolerate</b> the acidity. The colonies were small and patchily distributed, and had not formed structurally complex reefs such as those that compose the nearby Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System.|$|E
5|$|The {{projected}} {{attack on}} Aouzou never took place, as {{the dimensions of}} the victory obtained at Maaten made France fear that the attack on the Libyan base was only the first stage of a general offensive into Libya proper, a possibility that France was not willing <b>to</b> <b>tolerate.</b> As for Gaddafi, being subjected to internal and international pressures, he showed himself more conciliatory, which led to an OAU-brokered ceasefire on 11 September.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of modern computer systems is increasingly often limited by long latencies of accesses {{to the memory}} subsystems. Instruction–level multithreading is an architectural approach <b>to</b> <b>tolerating</b> such long latencies by switching instruction threads rather than waiting for the completion of memory operations. The paper studies performance limitations in distributed–memory block multithreaded systems and determines conditions for such systems to be balanced. Event– driven simulation of a timed Petri net model of a simple distributed–memory system confirms the derived performance results. ...|$|R
5|$|A {{course of}} {{brachytherapy}} {{can be completed}} {{in less time than}} other radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance for surviving cancer-cells to divide and grow in the intervals between each radiotherapy dose. Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and may receive the treatment as outpatients. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients. These features of brachytherapy mean that most patients are able <b>to</b> <b>tolerate</b> the brachytherapy procedure very well.|$|E
5|$|A graphic {{description}} of the nuckelavee as it appears on land was given by an islander {{who claimed to have}} had a confrontation with it, but accounts describing the details of the creature's appearance are inconsistent. In common with many other sea monsters it is unable <b>to</b> <b>tolerate</b> fresh water, therefore those it is pursuing have only to cross a river or stream to be rid of it. The nuckelavee is kept in confinement during the summer months by the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient Orcadian spirit, and the only one able to control it.|$|E
5|$|Ailanthus {{has been}} used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine {{drainage}} has occurred and it has been shown <b>to</b> <b>tolerate</b> pH levels as low as 4.1 (approximately that of tomato juice). It can withstand very low phosphorus levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system. It is frequently found in areas where few trees can survive. The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes. Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.|$|E
50|$|In the wild, {{this species}} almost always grows close to coastal areas {{where it is}} adapted <b>to</b> <b>tolerating</b> heavy winds, high {{concentrations}} of salt, and even drought. It naturally grows in sandy and calcareous soils where it does best in basic, high pH, soil conditions. This species is native to regions of the southern United States and the Florida Keys, western Cuba, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Hispaniola, the eastern coast of the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico, Belize, Honduras, and Nicaragua.|$|R

5|$|Amid the enquiry, Thompson and Maguire {{received}} {{a number of}} threats and had <b>to</b> <b>tolerate</b> other more minor vexations. Maguire, unaccustomed to the African bush as he was, brought a number of accusations on himself through his personal habits. One day he happened to clean his false teeth in what the Matabele considered a sacred spring and accidentally dropped some eau de Cologne into it; the angry locals interpreted this as him deliberately poisoning the spring. They also alleged that Maguire partook of witchcraft and spent his nights riding around the bush on a hyena.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{domestic}} opposition, internal demoralization, and international hostility, Gaddafi assumed a more conciliatory attitude following his defeat. On the other side, Habré also found himself vulnerable, as the French {{feared that the}} attack on Maatan as-Sarrah was only {{the first stage of}} a general offensive into Libya proper, a possibility that France was not disposed <b>to</b> <b>tolerate.</b> As a result, Mitterrand forced Habré to accept the mediation efforts of the Organization of African Unity's Zambian Chairman, Kenneth Kaunda, which resulted in a ceasefire on September 11.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis {{is known}} to be able <b>to</b> <b>tolerate</b> and even thrive on soil that is {{contaminated}} with toxic heavy metals, such as soil that might be found near metal smelters. The mushroom's resistance to heavy-metal toxicity is conferred by a biochemical called a phytochelatin—an oligopeptide whose production is induced after exposure to metal. Phytochelatins are chelating agents, capable of forming multiple bonds with the metal; in this state, the metal cannot normally react with other elements or ions and is stored in a detoxified form in the mushroom tissue.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} update {{ordering}} protocol based on gossiping for geographically distributed replicas. We target large scale distributed systems without central authority. Updates are disseminated epidemically and continuously {{applied to the}} replicas despite network partitions and asynchrony. No two updates are ever performed in different orders, but gaps might occur during periods of unreliable communication. These gaps are filled whenever connectivity is provided: consistency is then eventually ensured, but without any conscious commitment. This unconsciousness is the key <b>to</b> <b>tolerating</b> perpetual asynchrony. A simulation study shows that the protocol is scalable and achieves high throughput under load. ...|$|R
