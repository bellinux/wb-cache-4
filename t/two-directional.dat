Radio control 'channels' were originally outputs from a reed array, in other words, a simple on-off switch.

50|$|Psychology is a so well {{developed}} discipline that allows different specializations: a) clinical and health psychology, b) work and organizational psychology, c) educational psychology, etc. What differentiates an educational psychologist from other psychologists or specialists is constituted by an academic triangle whose vertexes {{are represented by}} three categories: teachers, students and curricula (see diagram). The use of plural in these three cases assumes two meanings: a) the traditional or official one and b) other more general derived from our information and knowledge society. The plural also indicates that nowadays {{we can no longer}} consider the average student or teacher, or a closed curriculum, but the enormous variety found in our students, teachers and curricula. The triangle vertexes are connected by <b>two-directional</b> arrows, allowing four-fold typologies instead of the traditional two-way relationships (e.g., teacher-student). In this way, we can find, in different educational contexts, groups of good teachers and students (excellent teaching/learning processes and products), groups of good teachers but bad students, and groups of bad teachers and good students, producing in both cases lower levels of academic achievements. In addition, we can find groups of bad teachers and bad students (school failure).This specific work of an educational psychologist takes place in different contexts: micro-, meso- and macro-systems. Microsystems refer to family contexts, where atmosphere, hidden curriculum, and expectations and behaviors of all family members determine, to a large extent, the educational development of each student. The term mesosystem refers to all variety of contexts found in educational institutions, knowing that different variables such as geographical location, institution marketing or type of teachers and students, etc., can influence the academic results of students. Macrosystem has a much more general and global nature, leading us, for example, to consider the influence that the different societies or countries have on educational final products. One illustrative example of this level can be the analyses carried out on data gathered by the PISA reports. This approach would be the essence of educational psychology versus school psychology for many of U.S. educational researchers and for Division 15 of APA.|$|E

40|$|The inelastic dynamic {{analysis}} of multistory unbraced and braced steel space frames with H-shaped columns is performed {{to investigate the}} inelastic behavior under <b>two-directional</b> and one-directional excitations.

The results are summarized as follows: 1) The displacement responses of the frame under <b>two-directional</b> excitations in general are greater than those under one-directional excitation. The first floor horizontal displacement responses of unbraced frames in x-direction increase with the increasing axial force under <b>two-directional</b> excitation, although those frames are still stable under one-directional excitation. In {{the case of the}} braced frames, the first floor horizontal displacement in x-and y- directions increase with the increase in the rotation angle because of large change of axial force induced by the braces. 2) Designing to have the optimum strength distribution of columns prevents the frames from the increase of relative displacement under <b>two-directional</b> excitation.

40|$|Abstract Background: Many polyhydroxylated piperidines are inhibitors of the {{oligosaccharide}} processing enzymes, glycosidases and glycosyltransferases. Aza- C -linked disaccharide mimetics are {{compounds in}} which saturated polyhydroxylated nitrogen and oxygen heterocycles are linked by an all-carbon tether. The saturated oxygen heterocycle {{has the potential}} to mimic the departing sugar in a glycosidase-catalysed reaction and aza- C -linked disaccharide mimetics may, therefore, be more potent inhibitors of these enzymes. Results: The scope, limitations and diastereoselectivity of the dihydroxylation of stereoisomeric 2 -butyl- 1 -(toluene- 4 -sulfonyl) - 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydro-pyridin- 3 -ols is discussed. In the absence of a 6 -substituent on the piperidine ring, the Upjohn (cat. OsO 4, NMO, acetone-water) and Donohoe (OsO 4, TMEDA, CH 2 Cl 2) conditions allow complementary diastereoselective functionalisation of the alkene of the (2 R *, 3 R *) diastereoisomer. However, {{in the presence of a}} 6 -substituent, the reaction is largely controlled by steric effects with both reagents. The most synthetically useful protocols were exploited in the <b>two-directional</b> synthesis of aza- C -linked disaccharide analogues. A <b>two-directional</b> oxidative ring expansion was used to prepare bis-enones such as (2 R, 6 S, 2 ' S) - 6 -methoxy- 2 -(6 -methoxy- 3 -oxo- 3, 6 -dihydro- 2 H -pyran- 2 -ylmethyl) - 1 -(toluene- 4 -sulfonyl) - 1, 6 -dihydro- 2 H -pyridin- 3 -one from the corresponding difuran. Selective substitution of its N,O acetal was possible. The stereochemical outcome of a <b>two-directional</b> Luche reduction step was different in the two heterocyclic rings, and depended on the conformation of the ring. Finally, <b>two-directional</b> diastereoselective dihydroxylation yielded seven different aza- C -linked disaccharide analogues. Conclusion: A <b>two-directional</b> approach may be exploited in the synthesis of aza- C -linked disaccharide mimetics. Unlike previous approaches to similar molecules, neither of the heterocyclic rings is directly derived from a sugar, allowing mimetics with unusual configurations to be prepared. The work demonstrates that highly unsymmetrical molecules may be prepared using a two directional approach. The deprotected compounds may have potential as inhibitors of oligosaccharide-processing enzymes and as tools in chemical genetic investigations. </p...|$|E
