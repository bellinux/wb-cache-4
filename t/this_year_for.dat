2500|$|Despite Davis' {{coherent}} and well-founded refutation, the NARAS stuck by {{its decision to}} disallow Whitney Houston from competing for best new artist in the balloting.

[...] If differences of opinion arise as {{to the extent of}} identity a solo artist may have had while with a previously released group, we take a vote and abide by the majority." [...] Green noted firmly that [...] "Houston's two duet recordings were entered in the 1984 Grammy Awards process for consideration for nomination. That alone was sufficient to make her ineligible <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> best new artist according to academy criteria. Aside from that, her performance on these recordings made a substantial contribution to their success and merit [...]" [...] Finally, the NARAS nominated a-ha, Freddie Jackson, Katrina and the Waves, Julian Lennon and Sade for Best New Artist. The award went to Sade.|$|E

2500|$|As {{early as}} March 2007 {{it was decided}} to {{strengthen}} the Waibaidu bridge due to [...] "concerns that construction of a nearby tunnel could damage the structure.

The piers along the steel truss Waibaidu Bridge will be upgraded following a complete inspection....City engineers have managed to track down the original blueprints, which were written in English." [...] Part of the reason for the restoration project was [...] "to make way {{for the construction of a}} huge two-level vehicle tunnel called the [...] "Bund Passage" [...] below the Bund, or Zhongshan Road E1, to alleviate ground traffic congestion." [...] According to the Shanghai Daily newspaper in 2008, [...] "Despite its 100 years of use, the bridge recently passed a quality test which showed it would have been safe to use for at least 30 years even without this major facelift." [...] The restoration plan, whose key concept was [...] "restoring and reinforcing the original style", was approved by the State Cultural Relic Bureau, with the stipulation that [...] "the bridge's body above the lowest water level was kept intact".|$|E
2500|$|Livy is {{the only}} source for the events of 297 BC. He wrote that envoys from Sutrium, Nepete (Romans colonies) and Falerii in {{southern}} Etruria arrived in Rome with news that the Etruscan city-states were discussing suing for peace. This freed both consuls, who marched on Samnium, Quintus Fabius by way of Sora and Publius Decius through {{the land of the}} Sidicini. A Samnite army had prepared to confront them in a valley near Tifernum, but it was defeated by Quintus Fabius. [...] Meanwhile, Publius Decius had camped at Maleventum where an Apulian army would have joined the Samnites in the battle against Quintus Fabius had Publius Decius not defeated it. The two consuls then spent four months ravaging Samnium. [...] Fabius also seized Cimetra (location unknown). [...] There are no major problems with Livy's account, but no parallel sources survive to confirm it either. Fabius' route via Sora to Tifernum is convoluted, but not insurmountable. [...] The appearance of an Apulian army at Maleventum is surprising since nothing is known of Apulian hostility to Rome since the conclusion of peace in 312 BC. [...] However the Apulians might have been divided in their alliance with Rome or have been provoked to war by the campaign of Barbatus the previous year. Publius Decius' campaign fits within the larger pattern of Roman warfare in south-eastern Italy; he might even have wintered in Apulia. No triumphs are recorded in <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> either of the consuls, hence they are unlikely to have had any victories of great significance or made any deep inroads into Samnium.|$|E
