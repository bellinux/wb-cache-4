5|$|A third {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1868 {{at a cost of}} £50,000, within the shell of the old theatre, for Lord Dudley. It was designed by Charles Lee and Sons and <b>their</b> <b>partner,</b> William Pain. They had taken over John Nash's practice on his retirement. The new theatre was designed to be less susceptible to fire, with brick firewalls, iron roof trusses and Dennett's patent gypsum-cement floors. The auditorium had four tiers, with a stage large enough for the greatest spectaculars. For opera, the theatre seated 1,890, and for plays, with the orchestra pit removed, 2,500. As a result of a dispute over the rent between Dudley and Mapleson, and a decline in the popularity of ballet, the theatre remained dark until 1874, when it was sold to a Revivalist Christian group for £31,000.|$|E

40|$|Women {{with breast}} cancer receive support from <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> {{to deal with the}} side effects of therapies over the cancer trajectory. Hormonal therapy (HT) is usually given after {{completing}} other treatments, and women receiving HT reclaim their normal life. This may lead to changes in support from <b>their</b> <b>partners.</b> Therefore, we explored women's perceptions of the support provided by <b>their</b> male <b>partners</b> in managing the side effects of adjuvant HT. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 women who received HT and recognized <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> as a main source of support. An interview guide was used to explore their experiences of treatment side effects, the contents of support received from <b>their</b> <b>partners,</b> <b>their</b> need for support, and their overall relationship with <b>their</b> <b>partners.</b> Interviews were analysed by content analysis. A theme on how participants perceived support from <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> was formulated as “Support not corresponding to transition to a new treatment” with the following categories: “Shrinking support,” “Primacy of partner,” and “Solitary new treatment. ” Participants felt lack of support from <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> because <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> did not understand their experience of the side effects induced by HT. Unlike the side effects of past treatments such as surgery and chemotherapy, side effects of HT cannot be observed and are highly subjective. <b>Their</b> <b>partners</b> often failed to notice these symptoms and provided little support. Nevertheless, participants aimed to accept the existing support without asking for more. They were left alone in the continuing trajectory of breast cancer. After starting HT, women entered a new treatment phase in which less understanding and support was provided by partners. Educational support for couples may enable sharing of subjective symptoms that are not obvious to partners and improve outcomes by facilitating partner engagement and support...|$|R

5|$|Resident Evil 5 is {{the first}} game in the Resident Evil series {{designed}} for two-player cooperative gameplay. The first player controls Redfield, {{a former member of}} the fictional Special Tactics and Rescue Service (STARS) and current member of the BSAA, and a second player can control Alomar, who is introduced in this game. If a person plays alone, Alomar is controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). When the game has been completed once, there is an option to make Alomar the primary character. Two-player mode is available online or split-screen with a second player using the same console. A second player joining a split-screen game in progress will make the game reload the last checkpoint (the point at which the game was last saved); the second player joining an online game will have to wait until the first player reaches the next checkpoint, or restarts the previous one, to play. In split-screen mode, one player's viewpoint is presented in the top half of the screen, and the other in the bottom half, but each viewpoint is presented in widescreen format, rather than using the full width of the screen, resulting in unused space to the left and right of the two windows. If one player has critical health, only <b>their</b> <b>partner</b> can resuscitate them, and they will die if <b>their</b> <b>partner</b> cannot reach them. At certain points, players are deliberately separated. Players can trade items during gameplay, although weapons cannot be traded with online players. The game's story-line is linear, and interaction with other characters is mostly limited to cut-scenes.|$|E
5|$|The game blends investigative {{elements}} with fast-paced action sequences, including chases, combat, interrogations and gunfights. Players use melee {{attacks and}} firearms to fight enemies, and may run, jump or use vehicles {{to navigate the}} world. In combat, auto-aim and a cover system {{can be used as}} assistance against enemies. Should player characters take damage, the character's health will gradually regenerate. Weapons can only be used in appropriate circumstances, such as during firefights. When driving vehicles, players have the option to skip directly to the destination by nominating <b>their</b> <b>partner</b> as the driver. Players can also ask the partner for directions. In addition to storyline cases, players may engage in an optional 40 side-investigations, known as Street Crimes, that are not related to the case that they are working on. Some street crimes will feature characters from previous cases.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at {{seven to eight}} years old, and males at seven to 10 years. The {{beginning}} of a female's ovulation is {{a signal to the}} males that she is ready to mate. During ovulation, the skin of the female's anogenital area swells and turns a bright red/pink. The swelling makes it difficult to move and increases the female's chance of microbial or parasitic infection. Females with more swollen anogenital areas reproduce while younger, produce more offspring per year, and those offspring {{have a better chance of}} surviving. These females also attract more males, and are more likely to cause aggressive fights between them. Olive baboons tend to mate promiscuously. A male forms a mating consortship with an estrous female, staying close to and copulating with her. Males guard <b>their</b> <b>partner</b> against any other male trying to mate with her. Unless a female is in a multiday consortship, she often copulates with more than one male each day. Multiple copulations are not necessary for reproduction, but may function to make the actual paternity of the female's offspring ambiguous. This lack of paternal certainty could help reduce the occurrence of infanticide. Occasionally, male olive baboons monopolize a female for her entire period of probable conception. The male protects his female from being mated by other males during consortship.|$|E

25|$|Mashek and Sherman report some {{interesting}} {{findings on the}} desire for less closeness with partners. Sometimes too much intimacy can be suffocating. People in this situation desire less closeness with <b>their</b> <b>partners.</b> On one hand, the relationship between attachment styles and desire for less closeness is predictable. People who have fearful–avoidant and anxious–preoccupied attachment styles typically want greater closeness with <b>their</b> <b>partners.</b> People who have dismissive–avoidant attachment styles typically want less closeness with <b>their</b> <b>partners.</b> On the other hand, the relatively {{large numbers of people}} who admit to wanting less closeness with <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> (up to 57% in some studies) far outnumbers the people who have dismissive–avoidant attachment styles. This suggests people who have secure, anxious–preoccupied, or fearful–avoidant attachment styles sometimes seek less closeness with <b>their</b> <b>partners.</b> The desire for less closeness is not determined by attachment styles alone.|$|R

5|$|Ilya Salkind {{had first}} {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} a Superman film in late 1973. In November 1974, after a long, difficult process with DC Comics, the Superman film rights were purchased by Ilya, his father Alexander Salkind, and <b>their</b> <b>partner</b> Pierre Spengler. DC wanted a list of actors that were to be considered for Superman, and approved the producer's choices of Muhammad Ali, Al Pacino, James Caan, Steve McQueen, Clint Eastwood and Dustin Hoffman. The filmmakers felt it was best to film Superman and Superman II back-to-back, simultaneously, and to make a negative pickup deal with Warner Bros. William Goldman was approached to write the screenplay, while Leigh Brackett was considered. Ilya hired Alfred Bester, who began writing a film treatment. Alexander felt, however, that Bester was not famous enough, so he hired Mario Puzo (The Godfather) to write the screenplay at a $600,000 salary. Francis Ford Coppola, William Friedkin, Richard Lester, Peter Yates, John Guillermin, Ronald Neame and Sam Peckinpah were in negotiations to direct. Peckinpah dropped out when he produced a gun during a meeting with Ilya. George Lucas turned down the offer because of his commitment to Star Wars.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} 2D side-scrolling {{platformer}} {{in which}} the player controls either Diddy Kong or his girlfriend Dixie Kong through 52 varying levels over eight different worlds. The main objective {{of the game is}} to rescue Donkey Kong from King K. Rool. The game features a wide amount of enemies, which include land-based reptilian Kremlings, rats, bees and vultures. Enemies in underwater sections include pufferfish, eels and sharks. Each world culminates with a boss fight, which is required to be defeated in order to progress through that world. Similar to its predecessor, the player-characters may neutralise most hostiles by jumping on their heads, cartwheeling through them, or throwing a barrel at them. When hit by an enemy, the active character leaves the screen, thus control will immediately switch to the other character. The player can reclaim <b>their</b> <b>partner</b> from marked DK barrels throughout the game. If both characters die, the player will lose a life and will restart from the last checkpoint, which come in the form as a star-painted barrel. If the player loses all of their lives, the game will end.|$|E

Orton and Sheamus then teamed up to defeat Show in two handicap matches, first on the April 12 SmackDown via count-out, and second on the April 15 Raw via pinfall. On the April 19 SmackDown, Orton and Sheamus were defeated by Big Show and Mark Henry in a tag team match.

40|$|Introduction: Erectile Dysfunction (ED) {{is known}} to impact {{on the lives of}} men but few studies have sought {{to assess the impact of}} ED on women and there are no {{qualitative}} studies that have compared accounts from women and <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> on the impact of ED on the relationship. Current trends in prescribing of ED treatment focus on men and consider ED to be a male medical problem. Aim: The aim of this study was to obtain knowledge on how ED affected the lives of women and <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> and to gain insight into the impact of ED from a couple’s perspective. Methods: Qualitative accounts from women on the impact of ED were obtained from one to one semi structured interviews and from clinical interviews with <b>their</b> <b>partners.</b> Interviews were audio taped and tape recordings transcribed. The study sample consisted of heterosexual couples and compared feedback on the impact of ED from interviews with men seeking erectogenic treatment and <b>their</b> <b>partners.</b> Men attended routine appointments at a secondary care specialist clinic following referral to the clinic by their GP and were interviewed. Feedback from interviews with men was recorded in hospital case-notes. Men with severe ED that met the inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study and if they agreed were asked to deliver information about the study to <b>their</b> <b>partners.</b> Interview appointments were arranged for women that agreed to participate in the study and informed consent was obtained from both partners. Transcriptions of interviews with women were analysed using grounded theory. The size of the population sample was dictated by the theoretical relevance of the data in relation to the research enquiry. New concepts and new avenues of enquiry ceased to emerge from analysis of transcriptions after fifteen interviews. Results: Women expressed that ED consumed <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> and reported that <b>their</b> <b>partner’s</b> perception of “solving the problem” focussed on restoration of erectile function. These data were verified by men. Women expressed that they attempted to confront “the problem” by encouraging <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> to seek help but men delayed seeking help due to embarrassment. Women felt isolated and upset at the lack of reciprocity and struggled to make sense of <b>their</b> <b>partner’s</b> perspective, as men communicated to women that the sexual act was of optimum importance in terms of defining the relationship. Men expressed concern that <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> might seek sexual activity “elsewhere” which reinforced perception among women that men defined the relationship in terms of sex. Women were concerned that ED was a symptom of an underlying condition yet men ignored their advice to seek help. Erectile dysfunction affected men’s confidence and caused lack of self esteem. Men reported that ED impacted on their masculinity. Women expressed that ED caused significant disruption to their lives and agreed to <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> using treatment if it was likely to improve their quality of life by having a positive effect on <b>their</b> <b>partner’s</b> mood. Conclusions: Women were aggrieved and disappointed that ED had such a devastating influence on their relationship. The emotional trauma that women experienced and expressed suggested that feelings of hurt might prevail regardless of treatment outcomes. Women were disappointed that the bond in their relationship was weakened by ED and <b>their</b> <b>partner’s</b> reluctance to communicate. Men expressed fear of “losing everything” and felt that restoration of erectile function would solve all of theirs and <b>their</b> <b>partner's</b> problems. Lack of communication resulted in men and women relying on perception of how ED affected <b>their</b> <b>partners.</b> Although this study did not provide solutions to the problems that couples experienced it produced data that was unique in terms of insight into the impact of ED on women and <b>their</b> <b>partners</b> and identified the importance of considering the couple’s perspective on the problem when assessing ED. Further research is required into the impact of ED on couples as understanding of how ED impacts on a couple’s relationship is poor...|$|R
