The therapeutic groups were treated with LY 333328 with or without dexamethasone and LY 333328 -ceftriaxone with or without dexamethasone. Rabbits were inoculated with a cephalosporin-resistant pneumococcal strain (ceftriaxone MIC, 2 μg/ml; penicillin MIC, 4 μg/ml; LY 333328 MIC, 0. 008 μg/ml) and were treated over a 26 -h period beginning 18 h after inoculation. The bacterial counts in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the white blood cell count, the lactic acid concentration, the CSF LY 333328 concentration, and bactericidal and bacteriostatic activities were determined at different time points. In vitro, LY 333328 was highly bactericidal and its use in combination with ceftriaxone at one-half the MIC was synergistic. In the rabbit model, LY 333328 alone was an excellent treatment for cephalosporin-resistant pneumococcal meningitis, with a rapid decrease in colony counts and no <b>therapeutic</b> <b>failures.</b> The use of LY 333328 in combination with ceftriaxone improved the activity of LY 333328, but no synergistic effect was observed.

The objective {{was to determine whether}} <b>therapeutic</b> <b>failure</b> in patients infected with Staphylococcus spp. is linked to biofilm production, the presence of the ica operon, and the bacterial insertion sequence element IS 256. Methods Staphylococcus spp. isolates from patients with device-related infections were collected. <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>failure</b> with proper antimicrobial treatment was registered. Biofilm phenotype was determined by Congo red test agar and Christensen assay. Presence of the ica operon genes A-D and IS 256 was detected by PCR. Differences were compared through x 2. Results 100 isolates from staphylococcal infections episodes were included: 40 sepsis/bacteremia, 32 ependymitis, and 28 peritonitis. 73. 77 % of CoNS and 79. 5 % of S. aureus isolates harbored the icaD gene, 29 % of all isolates IS 256 -A+ IS 256 -D genes, icaA and icaB genes were only found in CoNS (27. 8 % and 21. 3 % respectively). <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>failure</b> occurred in 95. 4. % of patients with a positive IS 256 -A+ IS 256 -D S. epidermidis isolate, RR 5. 49 (CI 95 % 2. 24 - 13. 44 p ≤ 0. 0001), and 85. 76 % in CoNS isolates, RR 2. 57 (CI 95 % 0. 97 - 6. 80, p = 0. 05).

Miconazole, a new imidazole derivative, is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent purportedly effective topically, orally, and parenterally against {{a number of}} species of fungi. Three patients with the following culturally proven deep fungal infections were treated with miconazole: (i) destructive arthritis (Sporothrix schenckii), (ii) meningoencephalitis (Cryptococcus neoformans), and (iii) disseminated aspergillosis (Aspergillus fumigatus). All the organisms were susceptible in vitro to 1. 56 μg or less of miconazole per ml using a broth dilution technique. In each patient, miconazole administered intravenously in dosages of 30 mg/kg per day failed to control or eradicate infection. Miconazole serum levels ranged from < 0. 5 to 4. 35 μg/ml as determined by radial diffusion bioassay. Cerebrospinal fluid levels were virtually undetectable. In one patient (C. neoformans), miconazole was given intraventricularly in doses of 15 mg without response. <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>failures</b> were attributed to suboptimal body fluid levels of miconazole.

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the association of}} - 174 G/C IL- 6 polymorphism with failure in therapeutic response to methotrexate (MTX) or leflunomide (LEF). This prospective, observational cohort included 96 Mexican-Mestizo patients with moderate or severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), initiating MTX or LEF, genotyped for IL- 6 - 174 G/C polymorphism by PCR-RFLP. Therapeutic response was strictly defined: only if patients achieved remission or low disease activity (DAS- 28 < 3. 2). Results. Patients with MTX or LEF had significant decrement in DAS- 28 (p< 0. 001); nevertheless, only 14 % and 12. 5 % achieved DAS- 28 < 3. 2 at 3 and 6 months. After 6 months {{with any of these}} drugs the - 174 G/G genotype carriers (56 %) had higher risk of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>failure</b> compared with GC (RR: 1. 19, 95 % CI: 1. 07 – 1. 56). By analyzing each drug separately, after 6 months with LEF, GG genotype confers higher risk of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>failure</b> than GC (RR = 1. 56; 95 % CI = 1. 05 – 2. 3; p= 0. 003), or CC (RR = 1. 83; 95 % CI = 1. 07 – 3. 14; p= 0. 001).

40|$|Carbapenems {{are often}} {{antibiotics}} {{of last resort}} {{for the treatment of}} severe infections. They are stable to most beta-lactamases produced by gram-negative bacteria. However, bacterial enzymes named carbapenemases can efficiently hydrolyze carbapenems. They are produced most frequently by Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermentative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannnii. They belong to group A (KPC, SME, IMI, NMC), B (VIM, IMP, SPM, GIM, NDM, SIM, DIM, AIM) and D (OXA- 23, OXA- 24, OXA- 48, OXA- 58, OXA- 143). The accurate and rapid laboratory identification of carbapenem-resistant isolates is important to prevent spread of such multidrug resistant strains and to avoid <b>therapeutic</b> <b>failures.</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> options are often limited because carbapenemases are encoded on mobile genetic elements which often harbour resistance genes to other groups of antibiotics.

However, no studies have been performed to elucidate if these <b>therapeutic</b> <b>failures</b> were due to strain variability in meglumine sensitivity or were related to host factors. We have studied the in vitro sensitivity of 37 strains of Leishmania infantum isolated from 23 patients (11 human immunodeficiency virus-infected and 12 immunocompetent patients) with visceral leishmaniasis. Sensitivity tests were performed by infecting murine macrophages with Leishmania parasites and culturing them in medium containing different concentrations of meglumine. For each test we calculated a 50 % effective dose (ED 50) corresponding to the meglumine concentration at which 50 % of the Leishmania parasites survived. In vitro results were strongly correlated to immediate clinical outcome. All strains requiring an ED 50 of > 70 microg/ml were related to <b>therapeutic</b> <b>failures,</b> whereas all strains requiring an ED 50 of < 40 microg/ml corresponded to an initial efficiency of meglumine. Among those patients who were initially improved, relapses occurred in all immunocompromised patients and in most immunocompetent patients who had a short duration of treatment (15 days). Finally, we found that in vitro sensitivity of strains decreased progressively in relapsing patients treated with meglumine. Consequently, the physician may be encouraged to alternate meglumine with other treatments such as amphotericin B or pentamidine, {{especially in the case}} of relapsing patients...|$|R
