5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{that develop}} in the Northern Hemisphere are officially classified, by the warning centres on one of three intensity scales. Tropical cyclones or subtropical cyclones <b>that</b> <b>exist,</b> within the North Atlantic Ocean or the North-eastern Pacific Ocean, are classified as either tropical depressions or tropical storms. Should a system intensify further and become a hurricane, {{then it will be}} classified on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, which is based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 1-minute period. In the Western Pacific, the Typhoon Committee uses four separate classifications for tropical cyclones <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> within the basin, which are based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 10-minute period.|$|E
5|$|A final {{difference}} in Plutarch's account is Horus's birth. The form of Horus that avenges {{his father has}} been conceived and born before Osiris's death. It is a premature and weak second child, Harpocrates, who is born from Osiris's posthumous union with Isis. Here, two of the separate forms of Horus <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> in Egyptian tradition have been given distinct positions within Plutarch's version of the myth.|$|E

5|$|During evolution, darts {{appear to}} have been lost secondarily, i.e., after they had evolved and been functional. Vestigial darts (ones <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> only in a {{rudimentary}} condition) occur in the family Sagdidae, and in many Helicoidea, the surrounding organs have also degenerated (become non-functional). The sarcobelum is a fleshy or cuticle-coated papilla which {{is considered to be a}} degenerated, previously dart-bearing, organ.|$|E
5|$|Many LARPs have game {{rules that}} {{determine}} how characters can affect {{each other and}} the setting. The rules may be defined in a publication or created by the gamemasters. These rules may define characters' capabilities, what can be done with various objects <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> in the setting, and what characters can do during the downtime between LARP events. Because referees are often not available to mediate all character actions, players are relied upon to be honest in their application of the rules.|$|E

5|$|The Hockey Sweater is Carrier's {{most famous}} work and is {{considered}} an iconic piece of Canadian literature.

5|$|The Rhondda Valley {{is located}} in the upland, or Blaenau, area of Glamorgan. The {{landscape}} of the Rhondda was formed by glacial action during the last ice age, as slow moving glaciers gouged out the deep valleys <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> today. With the retreat of the ice sheet, around 8000BC, the valleys were further modified by stream and river action. This left the two river valleys of the Rhondda with narrow, steep sided slopes which would dictate the layout of settlements from early to modern times.|$|E
5|$|The {{island was}} cleared of its {{indigenous}} population {{prior to being}} mapped by the Ordnance Survey, so {{it is possible that}} many place names are speculative.

Of the nine hamlets that were mapped in 1801, seven of the names are of Norse origin.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{its great}} depth, {{for a long}} time Davidson Seamount had been preceded only by a sparse few investigations. Davidson is {{interesting}} to volcanologists because of its unique geology, and to biologists for its unique ecology. In 2002 the NOAA sponsored the first modern in-depth study of the seamount. The team included scientists, educators, and resource managers, with the goal of documenting species, taking geologic samples, and describing the ocean environment. The expedition documented many rare, previously undiscovered species <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> nowhere else, not even on nearby seamounts, including ancient coral gardens that are vulnerable to human activity.|$|E
