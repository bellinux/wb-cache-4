5|$|Bruce led the Australian {{delegation}} to the 1932 Imperial Economic Conference in Ottawa. He redoubled his efforts to improve Australian economic prospects with the empire, and the conference agreed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> form of his long-sought imperial preference scheme that would give Australia greater access and competitiveness in imperial markets over five years, an achievement for which Bruce received much praise from the Lyons government. The closer trading arrangements of the Ottawa Agreements would set the pattern for Australian-British trade relations until Britain's entry in the European Common Market in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Financing of {{the airport}} at Gardermoen would be done through a state loan issued <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> company owned by the Civil Airport Administration. This company would build and operate Gardermoen, but from 1 January 1997 it also took over {{operation}} of Fornebu. After the last aircraft took off from Fornebu on 7 October 1998, 300 people spent the night transporting 500 truckloads of equipment from Fornebu to Gardermoen. The new airport opened {{on the morning of}} 8 October 1998.|$|E
5|$|France, Russia and the United Kingdom {{recognised}} {{the autonomy}} of Greece, which remained a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. The three powers agreed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> intervention in order to convince the Porte to accept {{the terms of the}} convention. A plan to send a naval expedition as a show of force was proposed and adopted. A joint Russian, French and British fleet was sent to exercise diplomatic pressure against Constantinople. The Battle of Navarino (October 1827), fought after a chance encounter, resulted in the destruction of the Turkish-Egyptian fleet.|$|E

The film was set to have a limited release in North America on November 20, 2013, through Warner Bros. Pictures.

5|$|In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{campaigns for}} her staff's {{right to get}} flu shots from Dr. Leo Spaceman (Parnell), but Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) will not allow it due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> supply. Meanwhile, Jack tries to think of {{creative}} ways {{to spend time with}} his girlfriend, Elisa (Hayek), as she works seven days a week. At the same time, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) try to do something nice for the crew.|$|E
5|$|Limitations include that a {{consistent}} set of gases {{must be used}} which match the specific ratio model, and the specific ratio will only be relevant <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> range of depths. As the parameters {{move away from the}} base conditions, conservatism will diverge, and the probability of symptomatic bubble formation will become more unpredictable. There is also the requirement for the diver to do mental arithmetic at depth to calculate the parameters of a safety-critical operation. This may be complicated by adverse circumstances or an emergency situation.|$|E

5|$|Linear {{particle}} accelerators generate electron beams {{for treatment of}} superficial tumors in radiation therapy. Electron therapy can treat such skin lesions as basal-cell carcinomas because an electron beam only penetrates <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> depth before being absorbed, typically up to 5cm for electron energies in the range 5–20MeV. An electron beam {{can be used to}} supplement the treatment of areas that have been irradiated by X-rays.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{detailed}} {{design for the}} Merchant Navy class was undertaken by the drawing office at Brighton works, but some work was also undertaken by Ashford and Eastleigh. This division of responsibility was possibly due to Bulleid's wish to restrict knowledge of the new class <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> number of personnel. The design incorporated a number of novel features, compared to then-current steam locomotive practice in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Other service truncations {{also occur}} in the system during rush hour service only. On the Red Line, every other train bound for Shady Grove terminates at Grosvenor-Strathmore, in {{addition}} to the alternating terminations at Silver Spring mentioned above. For the Yellow Line, all trains bound for Fort Totten terminate at Mount Vernon Square. These are primarily instituted due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> supply of rail cars and the locations of pocket tracks throughout the system.|$|E

5|$|Previously, Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway (MTR) {{adopted a}} system to {{recirculate}} magnetic plastic cards as fare tickets when it started operations in 1979. Another of the territory's railway networks, the Kowloon-Canton Railway (KCR), adopted the same magnetic cards in 1984, and the stored value version was renamed Common Stored Value Ticket. In 1989, the Common Stored Value Ticket system was extended to Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) buses providing a feeder service to MTR and KCR stations and to Citybus, and was also extended <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> number of non-transport applications, such as payments at photobooths and for fast food vouchers.|$|E
5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{was used}} in earnest by the British Admiralty in the First World War. The marine artist Norman Wilkinson led research into dazzle camouflage, resulting in the painting of thousands of British and later American ships in dazzle patterns. He intended it not to make ships invisible, nor even to cause the enemy to miss his shot, but to deceive him into taking up a poor firing position. In the Second World War, dazzle was revisited by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, and applied <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> extent by other navies.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{kauri gum}} {{was found to}} mix more easily with linseed oil, at lower temperatures, than other resins, by the 1890s, 70 percent of all oil {{varnishes}} made in England used kauri gum.

From the 1930s, the market for gum dropped as synthetic alternatives were found, but there remained niche uses for the gum in jewellery and specialist high-grade varnish for violins.|$|E
5|$|The United States also observes tribal {{sovereignty}} of the American Indian nations <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty.

5|$|<b>To</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> extent, the Kootenay River {{has also}} been used for {{navigation}}. Commercial navigation began with steamboats in the 19th century to transport ores, lumber, passengers and other imported and exported products between the Kootenay River valley and the Canadian Pacific Railway station at Golden, British Columbia. Boat travel on the upper river ceased when a rail line was built along the Kootenay upstream of the big bend. Steamboats also operated briefly on the lower river and Kootenay Lake to service silver mines in the nearby mountains.|$|E
