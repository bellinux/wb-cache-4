5|$|<b>The</b> <b>menu</b> at the White House Passover Seder {{featured}} traditional American Jewish Passover cuisine such as gefilte fish, charoset, {{chicken soup}} with matzah balls, brisket, potato kugel, and macaroons. Salads and vegetable side dishes completed <b>the</b> <b>menu.</b> Lesser brought handmade shmurah matzah from the Chabad-Lubavitch center in Springfield, Massachusetts. Family recipes were emphasized: in 2015, these recipes included matzo ball soup from Ziskend's grandmother, carrot soufflé from Lesser's mother, and Raspberry Ganache Marjolaine from Chaudhary's mother. Recipes covered foods {{from both the}} Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions. The food was not strictly kosher, but kosher style. In 2014, the White House Passover Seder began inviting a guest chef to coordinate <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> with the White House executive chef.|$|E
5|$|Elements of {{the dessert}} course are served on dry ice, such as small round white {{chocolate}} balls of ice cream, {{which has been}} taken from <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. Other desserts on <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> include a hollow sphere of chocolate, which a hot chocolate sauce is poured over to dissolve the sphere in order to unveil the ball of milk ice cream within, and a fennel crème brûlée served with Alphonso mango. The wine list starts from around £25, and moves up to a 1961 magnum of Pétrus at £39,000.|$|E

5|$|The current menu {{still has}} {{elements}} {{from the earlier}} days of the restaurant, such as lobster thermidor and grouse. Chef Gueller produces modern French cuisine, with classical elements. Dishes on the restaurant's menu include a terrine of foie gras served with a salad of smoked eel, alongside apple served both as a jelly and as a purée. Foie gras was temporarily taken off <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> in 2008 following threats of protests from animal rights activists. The dish was later restored to <b>the</b> <b>menu,</b> and foie gras has also since been served with a duck terrine and pistachios.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>menu</b> under Chris Harrod is seasonal, using locally {{produced}} {{meat and}} vegetables. Tasting menu dishes include asparagus {{which comes from}} the nearby Wye Valley, while turbot from Cornwall is used. There are foraged items included in <b>the</b> <b>menu,</b> such as hedge bedstraw and pennywort. Charlock is served with crab, while hogweed is used in an asparagus based dish. He uses foams on dishes, including on a Jerusalem artichoke starter comprising caramelized artichokes with goat's curd, trompette mushrooms and Parmigiano-Reggiano.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the move}} to the Le Méridien Piccadilly Hotel, <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> and wine list were {{expanded}} once more. White sought to have a far wider range of wine than at other three Michelin star restaurants; one example given was that while a different restaurant might have four or five bottles of Pétrus, the Oak Room list had more than 70 different vintages. There was a collection of Château d'Yquem listed over five pages going back to 1850. By November 1997, the wine cellar was valued at £1.5 million, with an average weekly taking on wine alone between £25,000 and £30,000. <b>The</b> <b>menu</b> was changed to include more table service, such as meat carvings. The other courses and side dishes were carried from the kitchen on silver platters. The idea that this would provide entertainment for all diners, {{even if they did}} not order a course with table service.|$|E

The player does not receive any reward or punishment for participating in these battles.|$|E
5|$|In March 2012, Twitter became {{available}} in Arabic, Farsi, Hebrew and Urdu, the first right-to-left language {{versions of the}} site. About 13,000 volunteers helped with translating <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> options. In August 2012, beta support for Basque, Czech and Greek was added, making the site available in 33 different languages.|$|E
5|$|Seasonal {{items were}} first {{introduced}} to supplement <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> in 2002. Two years later, noodle-less entrees were added {{in response to}} the trend for low-carb diets.

5|$|The Nobu Restaurant {{features}} an Asian motif and is spaciously arranged with only round tables, granting larger aisles than square tables would. Large paper lamps in jellyfish images {{hang from the}} ceiling. Seating {{is available in the}} main dining area, the sushi bar, along a couple of high kitchen tables, or in a private dining area. There are also two teppanyaki grill tables, which serve as either a traditional grill or in combination with <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> and dishes from the main kitchen. In addition to chef Nobu Matsuhisa's signature dishes featuring black cod in miso sauce, rock shrimp tempura, and yellowtail sashimi <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> has variations on the dishes which are not available at other Nobu restaurants, as well as an exclusive list of sakes available nowhere else in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>menu</b> at Pétrus {{is split}} into several fixed price menus, {{containing}} modern French cuisine. It {{has been described}} by Zoe Williams as being distinctly Gordon Ramsay in composition, despite the influences of head chef Sean Burbidge. The meals come with an amuse-bouche, a pre-starter course, and after dinner chocolates in addition to the items listed on the menus themselves. A number of pan fried fish dishes have been on <b>the</b> <b>menu,</b> including mackerel with tomato chutney and a niçoise salad, and a sea bream course served with brown shrimp, samphire and an oyster velouté sauce. Further seafood related dishes include a langoustine and watercress soup entrée which was praised by food critic Jay Rayner. Sauces are generally delivered to the table in small jugs and are poured tableside.|$|E

Keys can also invoke the game setup, some of <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> options and some gameplay functions including scrolling and pausing the game. Players can select single units by clicking, {{and groups of}} up to four by shift-clicking or bandboxing. To move units, players can shift the mouse to select units on the main map, move to the unit menu to select an action, {{and then back to}} the main map or minimap to specify the target area; but shortcut keys can eliminate the middle mouse action in this cycle.|$|E

The restaurant has received mixed reviews from critics, but has been listed in The World's 50 Best Restaurants since 2010, and was named by Egon Ronay as the best restaurant in the UK in 2005.

5|$|Despite being off <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> in the United States {{for several}} years, {{the product was}} still sold in several other {{countries}} under several names during the interim of its unavailability in the United States. One such example sold by BK's European arm of the company is a larger version of the sandwich called the Big King XXL, based on the company's Whopper sandwich. The Big King XXL {{is part of a}} line of larger double cheeseburgers known as the BK XXL line; the XXL line was the center of controversy over product health standards and advertising in Spain when first introduced.|$|E
5|$|Freedom fries was a {{political}} euphemism for French fries in the United States. The term came to prominence in 2003 when the then Republican Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, Bob Ney, renamed <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> item in three Congressional cafeterias in response to France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. Although originally supported with several restaurants changing their menus as well, the term fell out of use due to declining support for the Iraq War. Following Ney's resignation as Chairman in 2006, it was quietly reverted.|$|E

Once a Grimoire is used, the magic spell {{associated}} with the Grimoire will remain in <b>the</b> <b>menu,</b> and players only need to spend magic points (MP) to cast a learned spell. Magic spells {{can be used to}} attack, heal, create status effects, and manipulate Ashley's elemental and enemy affinities. Certain magic spells allow the player to affect multiple targets by using a small sphere positioned within the Battle Mode wire frame. Unlike physical attacks however, magic attacks cannot be chained.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver are {{role-playing}} {{video games}} with adventure elements. The basic {{mechanics of the}} games are largely {{the same as their}} predecessors'. As with all Pokémon games for hand-held consoles, gameplay is viewed from a third-person overhead perspective, and consists of three basic screens: a field map, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and <b>the</b> <b>menu,</b> in which the player configures his party, items, or gameplay settings. The player begins the game with one Pokémon and can capture more using Poké Balls. The player can also use the Pokémon to battle or deceive others, often forming alliances or trends via the Team Rocket networks.|$|E
5|$|System 6's Apple menu {{cannot be}} used to launch {{application}}s.

System 6 supports 24bits of addressable random access memory (RAM), which allowed a maximum of 8megabytes of RAM with no provision for virtual memory. These limitations were fixed in System 7. The version of the HFS used by System 6 also has a hard drive capacity limit; it supports up to 2gigabytes (GBs) and 65,536 files on a drive. This limitation was not increased until System 7.5 which first increased the limit to 4GB.|$|E
