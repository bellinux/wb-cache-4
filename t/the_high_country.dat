Many people enjoy short walks and longer hikes to waterfalls in Yosemite Valley, or walks among giant sequoias in the Mariposa, Tuolumne, or Merced Groves.

25|$|Arizona is {{well known}} for its desert Basin and Range region in the state's {{southern}} portions, which is rich in a landscape of xerophyte plants such as the cactus.

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether the CEECs’ financial market development {{can explain the}} EU FDI in the CEECs during 1994 – 2012. <b>The</b> <b>higher</b> bank credit flows had {{a positive effect on}} the FDI in 2005 – 2012. This {{can be attributed to the}} major banking sector reforms undertaken before the CEECs’ EU accession. Second, the stock market size had a positive effect in 1997 – 2004. This is due to the fact that the EU membership announcement facilitated deeper stock market integration. Third, <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>country</b> income, in interaction with a higher bank credit flow, had only a small positive effect in 2005 – 2012. <b>The</b> <b>higher</b> income CEECs have pursued much deeper bank liberalization through large-scale privatization of state-owned banks. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>country</b> income, in interaction with a larger stock market size, had a negative effect in 2005 – 2012. A possible reason for this is that the EU countries have started to divert their new FDI to the non-EU countries...|$|R
