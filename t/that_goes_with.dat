The work on that study helped shape Franklin's ideas about the complexities of modern technological society.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of similar}} and {{additive}} effects, divers should avoid sedating medications and drugs, such as marijuana and alcohol before any dive. A hangover, {{combined with the}} reduced physical capacity <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>with</b> it, makes nitrogen narcosis more likely. Experts recommend total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving, and longer for other drugs. Abstinence time needed for marijuana is unknown, but owing to the much longer half-life of the active agent of this drug in the body, {{it is likely to}} be longer than for alcohol.|$|E

Cabinet ministers in Brazil are among the almost seven hundred senior government officials who enjoy special judicial standing which protects them, since they can only be tried by Brazil’s Supreme Federal Court.

Pistone recommended his autobiography , and Reddick found many parallels to it and the episode.

There were certain guys he really couldn’t stand, {{but there were some}} people he genuinely liked, even though ultimately he had to bring them down. I think Col. Broyles feels the same way about Olivia.

[...] Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger believed Overmars had his [...] "best years ahead of him" [...] and met his criteria of a player [...] "used to the pressures of playing for a big club and everything <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>with</b> it". He opined that Arsenal lost the Premier League at home the previous season – [...] "we were maybe the best away team," [...] and commented on their inability to play expansive football.

500|$|Producers {{identified}} {{the scene in}} which Elsa sings [...] "Let It Go" [...] as a pivotal point in the character's development. The scene depicts her choice to [...] "let go" [...] of her fear of using her powers. Character design supervisor Bill Schwab said, [...] "Before 'Let It Go', Elsa is really buttoned up, her hair is up—everything is perfect. During the song, she gives herself permission to be who she is and everything changes—her hair is more wild, her gown is magical. She's finally free—even if she is all alone." [...] Animators designed Elsa's appearance to reflect her metamorphosis; in the beginning, she is shown primarily in restrictive and confining outfits. Menzel said that, after accepting her abilities, Elsa's appearance becomes [...] "very vampy", continuing, [...] "She's quite sexy for Disney, I have to say—they're pushing the limits there a little bit! But there's a gleam in her eye and a supermodel walk <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>with</b> it and, for me, {{it was fun to}} be a blonde because I'm not in real life." [...] In a January 2014 interview with John August and Aline Brosh McKenna, Lee disclosed that Lasseter personally helped with conceptualizing Elsa's physical transformation: [...] "y favorite thing about it ... is the actual model for doing it was John Lasseter .... he was a huge help in talking through how we translate that emotional journey ... with the animation ... e got up and he’s like, .... 'her hair goes, and she transforms, and she struts,' and he’s doing it. He’s acting it out." ...|$|E
