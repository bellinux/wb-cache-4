5|$|In 1985, Goldstone {{ruled that}} the government's mass sacking of 1,700 black staff at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto had been illegal. The {{following}} year, {{he was the first}} judge to free a political prisoner who had been detained under a recently imposed state of emergency under which the government had given itself draconian police powers. Another important ruling against the state in 1988 resulted in the release of a detainee who had not been advised by the police that he was entitled to a lawyer. In 1989, Goldstone became the first South African judge under apartheid to take on a black law clerk, an African-American Yale Law student named Vernon Grigg. Goldstone also used his judicial prerogatives to visit thousands of people who had been imprisoned without trial, including some who later became members of the post-apartheid South African government. Although he could do little to free them, his visits served to reassure the prisoners – and serve notice to the prison administration – <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> a position of power was taking an active interest in their well-being. Few white judges at the time enjoyed the trust and respect of the black majority; Goldstone became a notable exception.|$|E

25|$|As Premier, Bhutto was {{reluctant}} to challenge the ISI's support for the Islamist mujahideen forces in Afghanistan which were then engaged {{in a civil war}} against the country's Marxist–Leninist government. In April 1989, Gul led an invasion of Afghanistan with the purpose of seizing Jalalabad, which was then to be formed into a capital from which the country's anti-Soviet, Islamist-dominated opposition forces could operate. When the operation failed and the Pakistanis were driven out by the Afghan Army, Gul blamed Bhutto's administration for the failure, claiming <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> her entourage had leaked details of the mission of the Afghan government. Gul was too powerful for Bhutto to force him into retirement, but she did transfer him from the ISI to another section of the military.|$|E
25|$|Poirot {{arrives in}} the middle of the night. They tell him the {{sequence}} of events and their suspicions regarding Mrs. Vanderlyn. Investigating the grass leading off the terrace, Poirot confirms that there are no footprints, which means <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> the house committed the theft and the papers are still there. He questions each person in turn. He understands that Leonie saw no ghost; she screamed because Reggie sneaked up on her to snatch a kiss. Poirot suggests to Lord Charles that he end the party so that his guests will leave the house. The next morning the guests begin to leave. Lady Julia believes that her son Reggie stole the plans since he is very short of money and was not in his room for a period the previous evening. She promises Poirot that they will be returned within twelve hours if no further action is taken. Poirot agrees to this and they all depart.|$|E

500|$|... "Time Will Crawl" [...] {{was written}} and {{recorded}} by Bowie in mid– to late–1986 at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland. He produced the recording alongside David Richards. Lyrically, the song addresses the pollution {{and destruction of}} the planet by industry. Bowie has cited hearing of the Chernobyl disaster in April 1986 as {{the genesis of the}} lyrics, and was in Switzerland {{at the time of the}} accident. He said, [...] "I was taking a break from recording [...] it was a beautiful day and we were outside on a small piece of lawn facing the Alps and the lake. Our engineer, who had been listening to the radio, shot out of the studio and shouted: 'There's a whole lot of shit going down in Russia.' The Swiss news had picked up a Norwegian radio station that was screaming – to anyone who would listen – that huge billowing clouds were moving over from the Motherland and they weren't rain clouds." [...] In another contemporary interview, Bowie said that the song [...] "deals with the idea <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> one's own community could be the one responsible for blowing up the world." [...] At the time, he also stated that it was his favorite song from the album.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary reviews were mixed. Chris Welch of Melody Maker {{praised the}} musicianship {{of the band}} and Anderson's flute playing, writing also that [...] "the joke {{at the expense of}} a local {{newspaper}} wears thin rather rapidly, but should not detract from the obvious amount of thought and work that has gone into the production of Thick"; he described the music as a creative effort where [...] "the ideas flow in super abundance" [...] but that [...] "needs time to absorb" [...] and [...] "heard out of context of their highly visual stage act... does not have such immediate appeal". Tony Tyler in his review for New Musical Express generally appreciated the construction of the suites and the arrangements, but he had doubts about the album's possible success. He called Thick as a Brick [...] "Jethro Tull's own stand-or-fall epic after the lines of Tommy" [...] and [...] "an assault on the mediocrity and harshness of lower-middle-class existence in '70s Britain". Ben Gerson in Rolling Stone magazine called Thick as a Brick [...] "one of rock's most sophisticated and ground-breaking products". Going further, the reviewer stated: [...] "Martin Barre's guitar and John Evan's keyboards especially shine, and Ian's singing is no longer abrasive. Whether or not Thick As A Brick is an isolated experiment, it is nice to know <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> rock has ambitions beyond the four- or five-minute conventional track, and has the intelligence to carry out his intentions, in all their intricacy, with considerable grace." [...] Rolling Stones Dave Marsh gave it 2 out of 5 stars in The Rolling Stone Record Guide, judging it had [...] "relatively undifferentiated movements". American critic Robert Christgau disliked the album, calling it [...] "the usual shit: rock (getting heavier), folk (getting feyer), classical (getting schlockier), flute (getting better because it has no choice)".|$|E

[...] Again the justification for de Valera nominating one of his senior ministers for the Presidency, were rumours <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> cabinet was, either deliberately or accidentally, letting information slip to the Catholic Church through the Knights of Columbanus.

Chad {{told him that he}} must keep it to himself for the time being: angels had come to call him to his heavenly reward, and in seven days they would return to fetch him. So it was that Chad weakened and died after seven days– on 2 March, which remains his feast day. Bede writes that: [...] "he had always looked forward to this day– or rather his mind had always been on the Day of the Lord". Many years later, his old friend Egbert told a visitor <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> Ireland had seen the heavenly company coming for Chad's soul and returning with it to heaven.

[...] Not only are fashion blogs easier to access, many fashion blog readers (interviewed in Swedish fashion management study) stated that fashion blogs are far more personable and are more 'up to date' on both local and foreign trends. [...] These blogs are granting unlimited access to the fashion world to anyone that has a connection to a computer. Karen Kay also stated that, “These days, before a designer’s runway show has even finished, you can bet your bottom dollar <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> the audience, or better still, backstage, has recorded every silhouette, signature shoe, styling detail and sulking supermodel, then uploaded it onto the internet for style watchers across the globe to enjoy”.
