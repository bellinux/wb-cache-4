5|$|Flanders felt that, {{to quell}} inflation, wage {{increases}} should {{be tied to}} productivity increases, rather {{than the cost of}} living.

He felt that with this approach everyone would benefit at the company level and in the national economy. Such an approach would require mutual respect and understanding between labor and management.|$|E
