5|$|Other {{factors that}} broaden the main {{sequence}} band on the HR diagram include {{uncertainty in the}} distance to stars {{and the presence of}} unresolved binary stars that can alter the observed stellar parameters. However, even perfect observation would show a fuzzy main sequence because mass is not the only parameter that affects a star's color and luminosity. Variations in chemical composition caused by the initial abundances, the star's evolutionary status, interaction with a close companion, rapid rotation, or a magnetic field can all slightly change a main-sequence star's HR diagram position, <b>to</b> <b>name</b> <b>just</b> a few factors. As an example, there are metal-poor stars (with a very low abundance of elements with higher atomic numbers than helium) that lie just below the main sequence and are known as subdwarfs. These stars are fusing hydrogen in their cores and so they mark the lower edge of main sequence fuzziness caused by variance in chemical composition.|$|E

25|$|Precious {{materials}} were {{demanded by the}} Portuguese court from the very beginning; thus we find several types of ornamental stones: lapis lazuli, agate, antique green, alabaster, Carrara marble, amethyst, purple porphyry, green porphyry, French white-black, ancient breccia, diaspore, and Persian gold-yellow, <b>to</b> <b>name</b> <b>just</b> a few.

25|$|Neural {{factors that}} limit acuity {{are located in}} the retina or the brain (or the pathway leading there). Examples for the first are a {{detached}} retina and macular degeneration, <b>to</b> <b>name</b> <b>just</b> two. Another common impairment, amblyopia, is caused by the visual brain not having developed properly in early childhood. In some cases, low visual acuity is caused by brain damage, such as from traumatic brain injury or stroke.

25|$|Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary (first ed. 1741–2) A {{collection}} of pieces written and published over many years, though most were collected together in 1753–4.

25|$|Another {{important}} category {{found in}} the library is the hagiographic texts. These are found in relative abundance in all monastic libraries, and the White Monastery is no exception. They are primarily intended for the spiritual edification of the monks rather than being accurate historical records of the saints. They include acts and related texts of many martyrs such as Saint Colluthus the Physician, Saints Cosmas and Damian, St. Philopater Mercurius, Saint Psote, Saint Theodore, Saint Victor, and many others.

25|$|Amerindians {{constitute}} around 45% of {{the total}} population. The two major indigenous or ethnic groups are the Quechuas (belonging to various cultural subgroups), followed by the Aymaras, mostly found in the extreme southern Andes. A {{large proportion of the}} indigenous population who live in the Andean highlands still speak Quechua or Aymara, and have vibrant cultural traditions, some of which were part of the Inca Empire. Dozens of indigenous cultures are also dispersed throughout the country beyond the Andes Mountains in the Amazon basin. This region is rapidly becoming urbanized. Important urban centers include Iquitos, Nauta, Puerto Maldonado, Pucallpa and Yurimaguas. This region is home to numerous indigenous peoples, though they do not constitute a large proportion {{of the total}} population.

25|$|The {{telescope}}s amateur telescope makers build {{range from}} backyard variety to sophisticated instruments that make meaningful {{contributions to the}} field of astronomy. Instruments built by amateurs have been employed in planetary study, astrometry, photometry, comet and asteroid discovery <b>to</b> <b>name</b> <b>just</b> a few. Even the “hobbyist” end of the field can break down into several distinct categories such as: observing deep sky objects, observing the planets, solar observing, lunar observation, and astrophotography of all those classes of objects. Therefore, the design, size, and construction of the telescopes vary as well. Some amateur telescope makers build instruments that, while looking crude, are wholly suited to the purpose they are designed for. Others may strive for a more aesthetic look with high levels of mechanical “finish”. Since some amateur telescope makers {{do not have access to}} high-precision machining equipment, many elegant designs such as the Poncet Platform, Crayford focuser, and the Dobsonian telescope have evolved, which achieve functionality and stability without requiring precision machining.|$|E

This is a trend all over the area, with Portuguese and British patrimony being just demolished and replaced by new buildings - instead of proceeding with careful restoration. <b>To</b> <b>name</b> <b>just</b> a few lost/demolished ancient buildings already in the 20th century: Madre de Deus church (dates back to 16th century,demolished/replaced); Our Lady of Health (16th century, Small Mount - demolished, replaced); Our Lady of Resurrection (16th century,Small Mount, destroyed with dynamite); Our Lady of Assumption (dating to 1640 - demolished/replaced by new one, Portuguese Church Street, Chennai); Our Lady of Visitation (original church dates to 16th century, 18th century one demolished/replaced, {{on the way to}} the Small Mount); British Governor House/Portuguese Madeira ("Madra") Family House (Chennai - demolished).
