5|$|Early in the afternoon, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> {{aircraft}} {{returned in}} larger numbers {{to attack the}} air transports. A flight of eight Ilyushin Il-10s appeared in the airspace between Seoul and Inchon, attempting to ambush transport aircraft while still {{on the ground at}} the airfields. The F-80s spotted <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> planes and engaged them. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> aircraft split into two groups of four and quickly destroyed a Republic of Korea Air Force T-6 Texan parked on the tarmac at Kimpo.|$|E
5|$|North Korean {{planners}} {{intended for}} three divisions to attack Taejon from three directions, supported by tanks. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 3rd Division {{was ordered to}} attack from the north, against the flank. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 4th Division would attack across the Kum River from the east and south, in order to envelop Taejon and the US 24th Infantry Division with it. Eventually they would also be supported by elements of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 105th Armored Division. Although <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 2nd Infantry Division was ordered to attack from Chongju against the American right flank, it was slow to move and arrived too late {{to participate in the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{fight was}} one of the first {{victories}} for American forces in repelling <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> advance. In stopping <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> advance at the Notch and around Masan, the UN forces were able to halt the progress of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 4th and 6th Divisions, grounding their flanking moves to a halt and forcing them to withdraw to rebuild and re-supply. In the meantime, the American forces along the perimeter were being reinforced by heavier infantry and armor formations every day. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> defeat and retreat around the Masan region allowed both sides several critical days of reprieve from battle. This would end when <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> force began its final offensive on the UN forces in its coordinated assault on the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|In {{two weeks}} of {{fighting}} in and around <b>the</b> fortress, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were able to gradually push back the UN forces from Ka-san and Hills 755 and 314 to the south, but the UN forces held out strongly and <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{were not able to}} quickly consolidate their gains. The UN forces defended the ground tenaciously, even assigning a battalion of engineers to fight on the front lines, eventually preventing <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> from advancing long enough for a UN counterattack at Inchon which drove <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> from <b>the</b> area.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> {{expected}} <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> {{attack on}} Kyongju, however, never came. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> turned east, crossed <b>the</b> highway <b>north</b> of <b>the</b> town, {{and headed toward}} Yonil Airfield. The next day the US Air Force, attacking <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> gun positions [...] north of Kyongju along the road, found many targets in the Kigye-Kyongju-P'ohang-dong triangle as they caught <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> advancing in <b>the</b> open.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the night}} of 9 December several <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> commandos burst into the Lee {{household}} demanding food and shelter. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> asked Lee Seung-bok if he preferred North Korea or South Korea, when he replied South Korea <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> began to beat him. Lee then said [...] "I hate Communists," [...] this enraged <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> who proceeded to kill Lee, his mother Joo Dae-ha (33), younger brother Lee Seung-su (7) and younger sister Lee Seung-Ja (4). Lee's father Lee Seok-woo and older brother Lee Hak-gwan managed {{to escape from the}} house and raised <b>the</b> alarm. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> proceeded to mutilate Lee Seung-bok's face by giving him a half Glasgow smile. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> fled <b>the</b> Lee house and were never identified, but they may have been among the 113 members of Unit 124 killed by South Korean forces.|$|R
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> {{infiltration}} on September 7 was repelled, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> {{attack on}} Haman {{ground to a}} halt. The North Koreans, racked by logistical and manpower shortages, focused more heavily on their attacks against 24th Infantry positions on Battle Mountain, as well as 35th Infantry positions at the Nam River. 24th Infantry troops at Haman encountered only probing attacks until September 18.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} August <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> {{troops had}} been pushed beyond their limits {{and many of the}} {{original}} units were at far reduced strength and effectiveness. Logistic problems racked <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> Army, and shortages of food, weapons, equipment and replacement soldiers proved devastating for <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> units. By late August, the UN command had more combat soldiers in Korea than the North Koreans did, and UN superiority over the air and sea meant the North Koreans were at a disadvantage which was growing daily. North Korean tank losses had been in the hundreds, and they had fewer than 100 tanks {{by the time of the}} Pusan Perimeter fight, to the Americans' 600 tanks. By the end of August the North Koreans' only remaining advantage was their initiative. However, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> force retained high morale and enough supply to allow for a large-scale offensive.|$|E
5|$|In {{the hills}} {{southeast}} {{and east of}} Yongch'on, the NK 15th Division encountered very stiff resistance. Its artillery regiment outpaced <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> infantry, expended its ammunition, and, without support, was then largely destroyed by ROK counterattack. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> artillery commander {{was killed in the}} action. After the ROK 5th and 11th Regiments arrived in the vicinity of Yongch'on to reinforce the demoralized 8th Division, South Korean action against <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> units was so intense that the two armies had no chance to regroup for co-ordinating action. On September 9 and 10 ROK units surrounded and virtually destroyed the NK 15th Division southeast of Yongch'on on the hills bordering the Kyongju road. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> division chief of staff, Colonel Kim Yon, was killed there together with many other high-ranking officers. The part played by KMAG officers in rounding up stragglers of the ROK 8th Division and in reorganizing its units was an important factor in the successful outcome of these battles. On September 10, the ROK 8th Division cleared the Yongch'on-Kyongju road of the North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|What {{followed}} was a two-week battle around Tabu-dong and Waegwan in which <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{were able to}} gradually push the 1st Cavalry Division back from its lines. However, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{were not able to}} force the US troops to withdraw completely or push the UN out of Taegu. When the UN counterattacked at Inchon, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were forced to abandon their attack on Tabu-dong.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{expected}} <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> {{attack on}} Kyongju, however, never came. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> turned east, crossed <b>the</b> highway <b>north</b> of <b>the</b> town, {{and headed toward}} Yonil Airfield. The next day the US Air Force, attacking <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> gun positions 4 mi north of Kyongju along the road, found many targets in the Kigye-Kyongju-P'ohang-dong triangle as they caught <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> advancing in <b>the</b> open.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were {{apparently}} {{unaware of the}} 1st Battalion withdrawal, because the next morning, July 25, two <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> battalions in a double envelopment came in behind the positions 1st Battalion held the night before, but in front of Major Gordon E. Murch's 2nd Battalion. There <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{were caught in the}} open by the combined fire of American tanks, artillery, and mortar, and the 2nd Battalion's automatic and small arms fire. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> suffered large numbers of casualties in this attack. Surviving remnants of <b>the</b> two <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> battalions withdrew in confusion. The 2nd Battalion took about 30 prisoners.|$|R
5|$|North Korean forces, meanwhile, flanked the American {{positions}} {{under cover}} of fog. The Koreans passed around the Americans' right flank and attacked the mortar positions in the rear. T-34 tanks also joined in the fight, and also passed around the American flanks while obscured by the fog. Around 0900 <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces in Chonui initiated a frontal assault on the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry's positions. An observer with the unit called in artillery and pushed back <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> infantry inflicting heavy casualties on the assaulting force. By 1100, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> infantry, supported by several T-34s, was pressing on A Company's position, which was undermanned. At 1125 the requested airstrike came in; American aircraft rocketed the T-34s to no effect while strafing the Korean forces attacking A Company. The aircraft were able to push back the attack for several minutes before running out of ammunition and being forced to leave. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> troops immediately resumed their assault.|$|E
5|$|Once {{again the}} fatal {{weakness}} of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> Army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success-its communications and supply were {{not capable of}} exploiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack {{in the face of}} massive air, armor, and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points. By September 8, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> attacks in the area had been repulsed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 2nd and 9th Divisions {{were almost}} {{completely}} {{destroyed in the}} battles. The 9th Division had numbered 9,350 men {{at the beginning of}} the offensive on September 1. The 2nd Division numbered 6,000. Only a few hundred from each division returned to North Korea after the fight. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> troops had been killed, captured or deserted. All of NK II Corps was in a similar state, and <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> army, exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after Inchon, was on the brink of defeat.|$|E
5|$|On August 17, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{resumed their}} attack. A {{battalion}} of <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> troops drove <b>the</b> ROK police out of T'ongyong {{but did not}} hold it long. UN naval forces heavily shelled T'ongyong as three companies of ROK Marines from Koje Island made an amphibious landing near the town. The ROK force then attacked <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> and, supported by naval gun fire, drove them out. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> at T'ongyong lost about 350 men, the survivors withdrew to Chinju.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{then moved}} against Taejon. On July 19, <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces entered Taejon, {{the site of}} the 24th Infantry Division's headquarters. Dean {{personally}} led the division in its stand at Taejon. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> quickly surrounded <b>the</b> city and moved in from <b>the</b> west, <b>north</b> and south.|$|R
50|$|In the quarterfinal round, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> faced <b>the</b> Portugal {{national}} football team. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> scored three unanswered {{goals in the}} first 24 minutes. Portugal needed a four-goal effort by Eusébio to pull out a 5-3 victory.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 4th and 9th Divisions {{were almost}} {{completely}} {{destroyed in the}} battles at Naktong Bulge. The 9th Division had numbered 9,350 men {{at the beginning of}} the offensive on September 1. The 4th Division numbered 5,500. Only a few hundred from each division returned to North Korea after the Second Battle of Naktong Bulge. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> troops had been killed, captured or deserted. The exact number of North Korean casualties at Yongsan is impossible to determine, but a substantial amount of the attacking force was lost there. All of NK II Corps was in a similar state, and <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> army, exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after Inchon, was on the brink of defeat.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> force {{eventually}} withdrew {{after several}} unsuccessful attacks, having suffered heavy casualties. As it was disengaging from Masan, US Air Force aircraft caught <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> truck columns {{as they were}} retreating, inflicting significant damage on them and producing further casualties. This fight, {{with a number of}} smaller engagements in the region, effectively stopped <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> offensive on the southern flank of the Pusan Perimeter. It also gave both sides a reprieve from the fighting to resupply and re-enforce before engaging in the Battle of Pusan Perimeter shortly after.|$|E
5|$|The UN counterattack at Inchon {{collapsed}} <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> {{line and}} cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> units began conducting delaying actions attempting {{to get as much}} of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18–19. After the forces there, the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units rapidly pursued them north, passing over the Naktong River positions, which were no longer of strategic importance.|$|E
5|$|Some historians contend {{the goals}} of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> at <b>the</b> Pusan Perimeter were {{unattainable}} from the beginning. According to historian T. R. Fehrenbach, the Americans, who had been better equipped than <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans,</b> were easily able to defeat their opponents once they {{had the chance to}} form a continuous line. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> did break through the perimeter at several points and were able to exploit their gains for a short time. Within a week, though, the momentum of the offensive had been slowed and <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> could not keep up the strength of their attacks. Most of the front saw only probing actions {{for the remainder of the}} battle.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> had two {{divisions}} (3rd and 4th) reinforced with one tank brigade (105th), and the South Koreans had one division (7th). <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans,</b> armed with Russian T-34 tanks, couldn't be stopped {{even by the}} added men of 2nd South Korean division with the Water security brigade.|$|R
5000|$|While {{monitoring}} <b>North</b> Korea, <b>the</b> Pueblo {{came under}} attack by <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> naval forces, primarily motor torpedo boats, even though U.S. Naval officials and the crew have claimed the ship was in international waters at <b>the</b> time. <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> boarded <b>the</b> ship and {{took her to the}} port at Wonsan. For the next 11 months, Bucher and his crew were held as POWs by <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans.</b> Initially, they were treated relatively well, with good food and living accommodations. However, their treatment turned harsher when <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> realized that crewmen were secretly giving them the finger, which they explained as being a [...] "Hawaiian good luck sign", in staged propaganda photos they had been taking of the crew. From then on they were regularly beaten by <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans.</b>|$|R
5|$|The US Army's 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, {{newly arrived}} in Korea, {{was moved to}} a road north of Hwanggan to block <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> People's Army's 2nd Division, {{advancing}} following the Battle of Taejon. In an unusually good first performance, the 27th Infantry was able to delay <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> division for almost a week, inflicting heavy casualties on it while suffering few casualties of their own.|$|E
5|$|A North Korean {{tank column}} {{equipped}} with ex-Soviet T-34/85 tanks overran {{the task force}} in the first encounter and continued its advance south. After <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> tank column had breached U.S. lines the Task Force opened fire on a force of some 5,000 North Korean infantry approaching its position, temporarily holding up <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> advance. North Korean troops eventually flanked and overwhelmed American positions and {{the remnants of the}} task force retreated in disorder.|$|E
5|$|Aided by air strikes, U.S. Army {{units were}} able to inflict {{substantial}} damage on <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> armor and other vehicles, but were overwhelmed by North Korean infantry. The two understrength U.S. battalions fought in several engagements over the three-day period and suffered massive losses in personnel and equipment, but {{were able to}} delay <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces for several days, allowing {{the remainder of the}} 24th Infantry Division to set up blocking positions along the Kum River near the city of Taejon.|$|E
50|$|But <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> troops occupying this hill {{already were}} moving {{to attack the}} one just taken by <b>the</b> British. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{supported}} their attack with artillery and mortar fire, which began falling on the British. The action continued throughout <b>the</b> morning with <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> fire increasing in intensity. Shortly before noon, with American artillery fire inexplicably withdrawn and the five supporting U.S. tanks unable to bring <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> under fire because of terrain obstacles, the Argylls called for an air strike on <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Korean-held Hill 388.|$|R
5000|$|... 17 January 1968: In an {{incident}} {{known as the}} Blue House Raid, a 31-man detachment from the Korean People's Army secretly crosses the DMZ {{on a mission to}} kill South Korean President Park Chung-hee on 21 January, nearly succeeding. The incursion was discovered after South <b>Korean</b> civilians confronted <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> and informed <b>the</b> authorities. After entering Seoul disguised as South <b>Korean</b> soldiers, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> attempt to enter the Blue House (the official residence of the President of South Korea). <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> are confronted by South Korean police and a firefight ensued. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> fled Seoul and individually attempted to cross the DMZ back to <b>North</b> Korea. Of <b>the</b> original group of 31 <b>North</b> <b>Koreans,</b> 28 were killed, one was captured, and two are unaccounted for. Additionally, 68 South Koreans were killed and 66 were wounded, the majority of whom were soldiers and police officers. Three American soldiers were also killed and three were wounded.|$|R
500|$|All day September 2, {{air strikes}} harassed <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> and {{prevented}} them from consolidating their gains and reorganizing for further coordinated attack. Some of the planes came from the carriers USS Valley Forge and USS Philippine Sea, [...] away in the Yellow Sea and steaming toward the Masan battlefield. At 10:45, Eighth Army messaged Kean that the 27th Infantry was to be alerted for a possible move <b>north</b> into <b>the</b> US 2nd Infantry Division sector. West of Haman <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> and US troops faced each other during the night without further battle, but <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> kept flares over their position. In <b>the</b> rear areas, <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> mortar fire on the 24th Regiment command post caused Champney to move it still farther to the rear.|$|R
5|$|American {{planners}} {{believed that}} the Hadong area was under attack from elements of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 4th Infantry Division, having just received replacements following its victory at Taejon. However, the soldiers in the area were actually from <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 6th Infantry Division {{under the command of}} General Pang Ho San. The two divisions were coordinating to envelop the UN's left flank and were extremely spread out. Therefore, only groups of a few hundred were advancing through the region, some with small numbers of tanks.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 30 {{percent of}} task Force Smith became {{casualties}} in the Battle of Osan. The task force delayed <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces' advance for only seven hours.|$|E
5|$|Before dawn on August 17, {{troops from}} both the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 5th Cavalry Regiment, {{supported}} by A Company of the 70th Tank Battalion, attacked Hill 303, but heavy North Korean mortar fire stopped them {{at the edge of}} Waegwan. During the morning, American artillery heavily bombarded <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> positions on the hill. Throughout the morning of August 17 <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> guards exchanged fire with U.S. troops attempting to rescue the prisoners. Around 12:00 <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> unit holding the Americans placed them in a gully on the hill with a light company of 50 guards. Several more American prisoners were added to the group during the day, bringing the number of prisoners on Hill 303 to 45. One survivor estimated that the total number of prisoners was 67, and that the balance of the prisoners were executed on August 15 or 16.|$|E
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{discovered}} that <b>the</b> agents had {{landed on the}} islands near Inchon, they made multiple attacks, including an attempted raid on Yonghung-do with six junks. Clark mounted a machine gun on a sampan and sank the attacking junks. In response, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> killed {{perhaps as many as}} 50 civilians for helping Clark.|$|R

5000|$|On 11 June, the South Korean Navy began {{forcibly}} {{responding to}} continued <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> crossings of <b>the</b> NLL by beginning a [...] "bumping offensive", using its boats to physically push aside <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans.</b> Four <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> boats were damaged, two seriously, while {{three of the}} South Korean boats suffered damage to their hulls. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> retaliated on 12 June by attempting their own [...] "bumping offensive" [...] but were outmanoeuvred by the South Koreans.|$|R
