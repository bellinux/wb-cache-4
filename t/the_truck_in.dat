Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the assassinations. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in <b>the</b> <b>truck,</b> <b>in</b> the basement, and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.|$|E

25|$|In 1975, {{encouraged}} by his then-wife Michelle {{and several of}} his Sigma Chi fraternity brothers, Letterman moved to Los Angeles, California, with hope of becoming a comedy writer. He and Michelle packed their belongings in his pickup truck and headed west. As of 2012, he still owned <b>the</b> <b>truck.</b> <b>In</b> Los Angeles, he began performing comedy at The Comedy Store.|$|E

25|$|The bridge has {{not always}} been the source of tragedy, the evening of the 18th of May 1969 is fondly remembered by many of the {{community}} when a truck laden with Bushmills and Cream of Barley Whiskey was traveling from Antrim to Dublin when its brakes failed coming down the hill and it rolled over the bridge wall into the river some 3 meters or so below, the driver survived and was brought to Hospital but the entire loot of liquor was strewn across the river bottom. Most of the town of Slane were quick on the scene, vans and truck were seen spiriting away from the wreck of <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>in</b> the dead of night. Several prosecutions followed, the actual quantity of whiskey taken away is still known only to the management of Bushmills and perhaps to the Insurance Company that followed up the claim. The following day five Irish Divers, Brian Cusack, Sean Sheridan, Joe Murray, Fergus McKenna and Sean Donohoe arrived and while the local people of Slane were still dredging for bottles they collected 408 bottles in total, the local butcher in Slane at the time was apparently still drinking Bushmills Whiskey four years later.|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} two men {{watching}} a rush in the screening rooms of a Hollywood studio. On the screen, an actress played by Madonna sings and dances to [...] "Material Girl", dressed like Monroe from [...] "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend". One of the men, played by Carradine, is a director or a producer and is immensely rich. He {{falls in love with}} the actress and wants to express his passion for her. He tells his employee, played by Wuhl: [...] "She's [...] fantastic. She could become a star." [...] The employee answered: [...] "She could be. She could be great. She could be a major star." [...] The former then concludes by saying: [...] "She is a star, George." [...] Madonna is in a pink strapless gown and has her hair in blond locks ala Monroe. The background is a reconstruction of the Monroe video, complete with staircase, chandeliers and a number of tuxedo clad chorus boys. Madonna dances and sings the song, while she is showered with cash, expensive jewellery, furs and is carried by the men over the stairs. At one time, she alludes herself from the men, by dismissing them with her fan. As the producer tries to impress Madonna, he comes to know that she does not like material things, but rather prefers simple romance. He pretends to be penniless, and brings her hand-cut flowers while paying a poor man a large amount to borrow (or possibly buy) his dirty truck to take her on a date. His plan seems to work, because the final scene shows him and Madonna kissing in <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>in</b> an intimate position.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Red Blooded Woman" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava, an English film director who had previously worked with artists like Beyoncé and Kelis. It was filmed in Los Angeles, California, in December 2003. It begins with a scene of a congested traffic jam in which Minogue is caught. She is shown seated in her car singing to the song in a sensual manner, with the camera repeatedly focusing on her eyes and lips. Her outfit is composed of {{a black and white}} singlet, a satin waist cincher, jeans with chain fringes, and a black sheepskin shrug (this outfit was donated by Minogue to the Arts Centre Melbourne and is displayed in the Kylie Minogue Collection). A few seconds later, she gets down from her vehicle and playfully makes her way to a tank. Climbing up on its ladder, Minogue dances seductively to the chorus of the song. She then resumes walking on the street and is accompanied by two doberman puppies who escape from a nearby car. After entering into the backseat of another car, Minogue begins unwrapping a red dress and proceeds to change into it as she is watched by various onlookers. As the second chorus starts, Minogue is seen dancing with a group of backup dancers at a different location. Her attire consists of a fluorine yellow bustier worn underneath a pastel pink dress designed by French fashion house Balenciaga. The scene changes back to the street, where Minogue is shown entering a truck. She dims the lights and then dances in a different outfit, consisting of a black bikini, red leggings, and laced gloves. However, she exits <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>in</b> the same red outfit she donned earlier. The rest of the video rapidly intersperses scenes of Minogue dancing inside and in front of the truck, on a car, with the backup dancers, and near a gang of motorcyclists.|$|E

2500|$|... 106 was {{originally}} an open-topped tram with reversed stairs. There were 22 seats downstairs and a further 34 upstairs. The body is of a timber construction with steel strengthening. By 1906, the reversed stairs had been altered to direct ones, and in 1911 it was rebuilt with a fully enclosed top deck. It used the conduit style of pickup, with the skate underneath {{the centre of}} <b>the</b> <b>truck,</b> <b>in</b> its original state, before being converted to trolley pole when it became a snow broom.|$|E
2500|$|All bodies used by both {{manufacturers}} {{were built}} by Garwood. A single boom could be raised and lowered by cable, rotate 180°, {{and carried a}} cable from a [...] winch. Outriggers and braces on both {{the body and the}} boom itself allowed [...] to be lifted throughout the rear 180° of <b>the</b> <b>truck.</b> <b>In</b> early models, all actions except for the winches were manual; later models had powered booms. The -A1 upgrade had a different boom and the front sides of the body were cut away from the mast and spare tires.|$|E
2500|$|The {{audio quality}} earned an almost full mark, where the [...] "24-bit 48 kHz {{lossless}} PCM serves voices well, and excels in more treble-prone sounds... Perhaps the most audibly dynamic sequence is the dawn chase scene after Moss returns with water. Close {{your eyes and}} listen to Moss's breathing and footsteps as he runs, <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>in</b> pursuit as it labors over rocks and shrubs, {{the crack of the}} rifle and hissing of bullets as they rip through the air and hit the ground... the entire sequence and the film overall sounds very convincing." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Task Force {{is simply}} a Light Force coupled with an Engine. An Engine is {{considered}} a single unit or [...] "resource" [...] when responding to incidents on its own. A Task Force usually responds to larger incidents, such as structural fires, and {{is made up of}} an Engine, a 200 Series Pump Engine, and a Truck, all operating together. While a standard Engine is always staffed with a full crew, a 200 Series Pump Engine is only staffed by a driver (and one other firefighter if responding as part of a Task Force). The purpose of the 200 Series Pump Engine is to provide support and equipment to <b>the</b> <b>Truck</b> <b>in</b> a Light Force, and either the Truck or the Engine in a Task Force.|$|E
2500|$|Trooper First Class D. Wayne Smith of the Maryland State Police was {{the first}} to arrive at the scene and {{immediately}} used his light blue unmarked police vehicle to block off the exit by positioning the car sideways between two parked tractor-trailers. As more troopers arrived at the scene, the rest area was effectively sealed off at both the entrance and exit ramps without the suspects being aware of a rapidly growing police presence. [...] Later, as truck driver Ron Lantz was attempting to exit the rest area, his tractor-trailer was commandeered by troopers who used <b>the</b> <b>truck,</b> <b>in</b> place of the police car, to complete the roadblock at the exit. With the suspects' escape route sealed off, the SWAT officers then moved in to arrest them. A stolen Bushmaster [...]223-caliber weapon and bipod were found in a bag in Muhammad's car. Ballistics tests later conclusively linked the seized rifle to 11 of the 14 shootings, including one in which no one was injured.|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>truck</b> <b>in</b> which I ensconced {{myself was}} laden with great sacks of some soft merchandise, and I found among them holes and crevices {{by means of}} which I managed to work {{my way to the}} inmost recess. The hard floor was {{littered}} with gritty coal dust, and made a most uncomfortable bed. The heat was almost stifling. I was resolved, however, that nothing should lure or compel me from my hiding-place until I reached Portuguese territory. I expected the journey to take thirty-six hours; it dragged out into two and a half days. I hardly dared sleep for fear of snoring.|$|E
6000|$|However, I worked {{five hours}} on the brute, and {{finished}} my Letter all the same, and couldn't sleep last night by consequence. Haven't had a bad night since I don't know when; dreamed a large, handsome man (a New Orleans planter) had insulted my wife, and, do what I pleased, I could not make him fight me; and woke to find it was the eleventh anniversary of my marriage. A letter usually takes me from a week to three days; but I'm sometimes two days on a page - I was once three - and then my friends kick me. C'EST-Y-BETE! [...] I wish letters of that charming quality could be so timed as to arrive when a fellow wasn't working at <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>in</b> question; but, of course, that can't be. Did not go down last night. It showered all afternoon, and poured heavy and loud all night.|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "shack" [...] (brakeman) takes a coupling-pin and {{a length}} of bell-cord to the {{platform}} in front of <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>in</b> which the tramp is riding. The shack fastens the coupling-pin to the bell-cord, drops the former down between the platforms, and pays out the latter. The coupling-pin strikes the ties between the rails, rebounds against {{the bottom of the}} car, and again strikes the ties. The shack plays it back and forth, now to this side, now to the other, lets it out a bit and hauls it in a bit, giving his weapon opportunity for every variety of impact and rebound. Every blow of that flying coupling-pin is freighted with death, and at sixty miles an hour it beats a veritable tattoo of death. The next day the remains of that tramp are gathered up along the right of way, and a line in the local paper mentions the unknown man, undoubtedly a tramp, assumably drunk, who had probably fallen asleep on the track.|$|E
