40|$|Over {{the last}} twenty years, Digital Interactive Technology (DIT) has been {{extensively}} introduced in museum contexts. Providing guidelines for aware introduction of DIT in museum, this thesis aims to encourage a participatory experience regarding the creation of knowledge in museum. Believing that creating knowledge is a complex process that simultaneously involves multiple actions, actors, actants, and situations, I adopt the concept of Infrastructuring Knowledge for describing the participatory dynamics among human and technology for creating knowledge and for museum to be places for memories, amusing and sharing experience. Ethnography in museum environment provides first hand information for understanding the museum visiting experience. Such understanding provides three key stimulus for DIT to Infrastructuring Knowledge: firstly, stimulating people’s dialogue; secondly, supporting people’s cooperation and participation by providing occasions for sharing information and creating knowledge; <b>thirdly,</b> <b>people</b> re-frame the use of DIT when needed. Designing DIT for museum may follow some specific lines and principles for addressing challenges related to overwhelming and overstimulating spaces, and for promoting a sustainable future in respect of the production (or not) of new technology. Following lines and principles for reacting to the overwhelming and overstimulating adoption of technology in public space, I propose an -ing approach to design. This approach aims to stimulate a design for people to adopt a subjective and participatory interpretation of Digital Interactive Technology...|$|E

40|$|The {{continued}} {{interest in}} political economy-inspired perspectives on {{economic and social}} policies {{is an attempt to}} understand policymakers as human beings who are influenced by values, votes and other factors that were once thought to be exogenous to policy choices. However, there is still little theorising about those {{on the other side of}} the policy equation. This article seeks a better understanding of how ordinary people engage in a very personal way with policy. I present a model of participation grounded in empirical research with members of a poverty-reduction project in Ghana, and a conceptual framework informed by an interpretive or sense-making approach to policy analysis. The model is based on the three principles of ‘subjectivity’, ‘temporality ’ and ‘situatedness’: First, human beings make subjective interpretations of policy grounded in their life histories; secondly, temporality is an inherent aspect of how individuals cognitively organise their lives; and <b>thirdly,</b> <b>people</b> experience policy as one of many overlapping contexts in which they are situated.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of individual investments in four field-specific educational resources on wages in The Netherlands. Based on a surrcy on the Dutch population. scales are developed that measure the amount of cultural, economic, communicative and technical resources that fields of study supply to students. It was hypothesized. first, that having invested {{in any of these}} four types of resources should enhance entry possibilities into jobs that rcquire related skills and knowledge. Secondly, economic resources are expected to affect wages positively. <b>Thirdly,</b> <b>people</b> whose educational resources match the type of job held are presumed to have a wage benefit from this match. Empirical analyses on two Dutch datasets (1 1 = 6, 373) generally support the hypotheses. in that matches increased wages in three out of four branches: economic. communicative and technical types of jobs. People who invested in cultural ficld-specific resources did not have a wage benefit in corresponding types of work. which may be explained by the generic character of the skills obtained. 1. Introductioii The socially unequal distribution of income has long been in the spotlight of sociological and economic research. In particular, the role of education in predicting income attainment has received a lot of attention.

40|$|In this research, I {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between Aum Shinrikyo and Japanese contemporary society. The significance of this investigation lies in how a society can avoid the development of dangerous organizations like Aum. The purpose {{of this research is}} to find what forms Aum-like entities, and how this is related to the society it is born from. I propose three points: Aum is a reflection of society, and it functions in a similar manner as society; people who joined Aum were ordinary citizens of society, and they conformed to the practices of Aum that Asahara determined, which is similar to the way that members of society adhere to societal norms; and <b>thirdly,</b> <b>people</b> joined Aum for various reasons, but it was society's shortcomings that people were dissatisfied with that caused them to abandon society. 	Haruki Murakami and Shoko Asahara's texts are my primary sources for conducting this research. Murakami's Underground 2 explores the three points mentioned above. He interviewed members of Aum for this book, and they reveal why they wanted to join Aum. This is significant to my study of Aum and society, because they provide their idea of what it was that society lacked. Asahara, who founded Aum Shinrikyo, wrote several texts that were spiritual guidelines for his followers. His writing sheds light on his dogma, as well as what people were attracted to in Aum that they could not find in society. 	My research shows that people were dissatisfied with society for various reasons. The most common reason was that people did not feel accepted in their society, especially because they did not see economic wealth as a priority, which is how society functioned. As a result, they sought more meaningful and purposeful lives by joining Aum, and Aum was able to provide them with righteous living and spiritual meaning. It is therefore argued that society must change {{in such a way that}} its members are content...|$|E

In all three cases, ASM takes place in peripheral regions outside central state control, where both land- and mineral tenure are characterized by high degrees of informality. Based on our comparative analysis, we highlight three core propositions. First, the relationship between ASM and surface land claimants is not (merely) characterized by antagonism, but involves a significant degree of negotiation and mutual benefit-sharing.

40|$|A {{discussion}} on the prophetic witness {{of the church is}} relevant in many respects. Firstly, most African countries have embraced democracy, without defining its contents; hence, democracy practised in Africa varies from one country to another. Secondly, democracy, itself, has left unpredictable consequences in African societies, where its leaders have cherished what they gain from leadership, rather than thinking in terms of community development. <b>Thirdly,</b> many <b>people</b> have lost confidence in the church in times of misery. The need for a solution to social crisis has created room for alternative modes of public discourse that compete with the church&rsquo;s prophetic voice of: &lsquo;Thus says the Lord&rsquo;. Fourthly, churches seem to have established a dichotomy between theology and societal realities. Fifthly, the church has, so far, concentrated most of its efforts on evangelising to the regular faithful who attend the Sunday service and other meetings and have rather neglected those on the streets. Lastly, &lsquo;armchair sermons&rsquo;, coupled with the effect of democracy seem to have moulded passive and expectant citizens, rather than challenge them to strive for a committed and responsible stewardship.

This thesis focuses on a case museum - The Albertina. The present research aims {{to answer the following}} research question: In what ways could museums use mobile communication to reach young adults? Methodology and Theoretical Framework First, the study utilized a single case study approach and various qualitative research techniques. An interview with art experts employed by the museum aimed to capture the museum's perspective. Secondly, online and offline observations were conducted reviewing the museums digital and print media. The observation aimed to establish what strategic role, if any mobile had played already in the museum strategy. Thirdly a survey was conducted to capture young adults' opinions. 30 people were approached over two days with a success rate of 53 %. The theoretical framework was constructed based on the relevant literature reviewed and it formed a base for the semi structured interview and survey questions and drove the thematic interests of the online survey. The framework illustrated the interconnections between museums and young adults. The museum's strategy, content and engagement efforts were analysed against the attitudes, perceptions and responsiveness of young adults. Findings and Conclusions The study recorded 4 main findings. First the museum had engaged in mobile marketing initiatives in the past and was still engaging in several initiatives. Secondly, the online and offline media lacked any cross promotion of the mobile initiatives. <b>Thirdly,</b> young <b>people</b> are motivated to get directly involved in the museum environment and displayed interest in incentive based engagement with museums and museum content.

Within secondary schools in Aotearoa New Zealand, {{there is an}} expectation that a response is made to schools that experience such incidents. There is much conflicting international research as to the efficacy of these responses. The adult experts are making decisions that they believe {{are in the best}} possible interests of the young people; they are putting together a quilt that they believe will nurture young people. The expertise and knowledge of a major stakeholder – the young people involved in the critical incident response – has been for the most part, omitted from research. This particular study set out to gather data about young people’s experiences of critical incident responses, so that the quilt being provided has input from this group and so is able to better meet their needs. The study had four major facets. It incorporated reflections on my intrinsic involvement in this field of practice and was, therefore, heuristic. Secondly, qualitative research was utilised to explore with young people their stories about what happened for them at the time of an incident. Thirdly, it incorporated principles of participatory research as an acknowledgement that young people are central stakeholders in secondary schools and that their voice was one that needed to be heard in order that the best responses may be offered. Lastly, it was utilisation focused. It was designed so that the findings were not just written up and filed away but disseminated to those who make decisions at the school level and policy level. At the analysis stage, two major methods were used. Firstly, inductive analysis was used to identify the themes that emerged from the interviews with the young people. Triangulation was then used to consolidate these themes using the input from Collaborative Groups and a systematic review of the knowledge that I have gained over the time that I have been involved with young people in the critical incident response area. This analysis of the contribution from the young people resulted in several areas being highlighted. Firstly, participants asked that those responding to critical incidents considered the use of language and the power of words, Secondly, they believed that schools needed to act proactively and to have a plan and, in association with this, that they develop a culture that better cared for the needs of young <b>people.</b> <b>Thirdly,</b> the young <b>people</b> involved requested that the ‘right’ people responded at the time of an incident: the qualities of the ‘right’ people and the ‘wrong’ people were also identified.

50|$|As a {{starting}} point, while {{there have been}} a number of international initiatives launched over recent years to defend civic space, civil society actors were lacking a strong common definition of the terms and shape of the civic space to be defended. To fill this gap, an informal meeting of CSOs, which took place in Bangkok in November 2015, asked the International Civil Society Centre to facilitate the development of a Civic Charter. The Civic Charter provides a global framework for people’s participation in shaping their societies. The two-page document, which people and organisations can sign on to and use as a basis for joint action, articulates a common set of civic and political rights. Aimed at civil society activists and their organisations, the Civic Charter connects those engaged in the everyday struggle for civic space - on a local, national, regional or international level. Firstly, it draws together the most crucial terms for civic participation in an easily understandable way. Secondly, it serves as a global reference framework to civil society actors for their rights enshrined in international law. <b>Thirdly,</b> it reaffirms <b>people’s</b> rights to participate in shaping their societies. The Civic Charter can provide a more effective basis for campaigning and advocacy for civic participation, as well as for promoting international solidarity with CSOs and activists in a specific country or region.|$|R
