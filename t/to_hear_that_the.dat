When Rhoads learned of this, he quickly made a public apology at a meeting of all staff and doctors. A while later, he was dismayed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> letter was going to be discussed {{at a meeting of the}} Puerto Rico Medical Association. With relations having deteriorated locally, he returned to New York in December 1931.|$|E
5|$|Andy {{rushes to}} the {{potential}} client, a company called Prestige Direct, and impresses the CEO (Dan Castellaneta) with his dedication—in addition to his personal phone number, he also gives him {{a copy of his}} house key. Meanwhile, Dwight, Jim, and Harry rush to the company in an attempt to win the client, only <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> company has gone with Andy. After Andy wins the client, he calls Robert and offers him the client if Robert will re-hire him. Robert is furious at his attempt to blackmail him, and hangs up on Andy. This leads Andy to seek help from David Wallace (Andy Buckley), the former Chief Financial Officer of Dunder Mifflin who has become a multi-millionaire. Andy tells David that, despite being in poor shape, Dunder Mifflin could be worth twice its net worth if the company's management is restructured. This piques David's interest, who allows Andy to come into his home and talk to him about his business proposal.|$|E
5|$|John and Prudentia Hogg {{were glad}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Shelleys had left England, hoping that their son {{would become more}} {{conservative}} in Percy's absence. They were disappointed with his continued rejection of their Tory political views, but he did attend church with them during his visits and {{was no longer a}} vegetarian. They were also somewhat concerned about Hogg's association with the radical publisher Leigh Hunt and his circle of friends. Through Hunt, Hogg became acquainted with several members of London's literary circles, including Thomas Love Peacock, Charles Lamb and Walter Coulson. Hogg also met John Keats, who gave him a copy of his first book of poetry.|$|E

5|$|Filming the pre-title {{sequence}} {{went through}} some alterations. One {{of the scenes}} saw Johnny being foot whipped, however the shot where the stick struck the soles of the feet was cut out due to its brutality. Also, when discussing how Johnny would be expelled from the mosque afterwards, Nalluri suggested using the idea where he is thrown {{to the top of}} the surveillance van, which would give the audience the impression that the antagonists were on to them. Later on in the episode, Nalluri wanted to include some exposition shots, which shows Khaldun's actions while he narrates them to MI5. In one scene, Tom observes Khaldun inside a prison cell by opening a slide view at the prison door. However one had to be made because no such doors exist in the United Kingdom. Following the broadcast of the episode, the producers were surprised <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> BBC were unhappy with a scene showing Harry holding a Costa Coffee cup, as the corporation believed it was done out of product placement. They were also surprised to learn that they did not take notice in a scene with Malcolm Wynn-Jones delightfully eating a piece of chocolate from a Black Magic chocolate box, which they thought was a more obvious example. Portraying actor Hugh Simon had to spit out the chocolate after the take as he disliked the confectionery.|$|E

Campbell had a short spell at West Ham United, beginning {{his career as a}} striker.

Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) is distraught <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> woman was Sonia Baker (Maria Thayer), a lead researcher on his staff. Collins, who has military experience, is leading an investigation into PointCorp, a private defense contractor with controversial operations involving mercenaries. Collins tells his former college roommate and old friend Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe), an investigative reporter, that he had been having an affair with Sonia and that she had sent him a cheerful video message on the morning of her death, which he says is inconsistent and unusual behavior for someone about to commit suicide.|$|E
25|$|Jiangling was {{initially}} situated on flat lands {{and was a}} very accessible location. However, Lu Kang later ordered Zhang Xian (張咸) to oversee {{the construction of a}} large dyke to block the river flow and direct its waters to flood the flat lands, so as to create a large body of water around the city to serve as a barrier to invaders. When Yang Hu arrived, he planned to make use of this barrier by transporting supplies on boats, but he spread false news that he intended to destroy the dyke to make way for his land army to pass through. When Lu Kang heard that, he saw through Yang Hu's plot and ordered Zhang Xian to destroy the dyke. Lu Kang's officers were shocked and attempted to dissuade him from doing so because they thought he would be doing the enemy a favour, but Lu ignored them. When Yang Hu reached Dangyang (當陽), he was dismayed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dyke had been destroyed. He {{had no choice but to}} transport his supplies on land, resulting in the wasting of time and effort.|$|E
25|$|On June 10, 1993, drug {{trafficking}} charges against Ovidio and Ponce Torres were {{dropped in the}} U.S without a stated reason. On May 3, 1994, Aldrete was sentenced to 62 years in prison. Cult members Elio, Serafín Jr., Martínez Salinas, and Serna Valdez, received 67 years each. In {{an interview with the}} press, Kilroy's parents stated that they were relieved <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cultists were sentenced. The charges were multiple homicide (31 years), possession of narcotics (12 years), involvement in organized crime (5 years), police impersonation (2 years), illegal body desecration (2 years), illegal possession of firearms (10 years), and illegal possession of weapons exclusive to the Mexican Armed Forces (5 years). The Mexican federal judge explained that the reason Aldrete received fewer years in prison than the rest was because she was not charged with using weapons that were military-exclusive, which carries a 5-year maximum sentence. He also stated that the maximum conviction a person in Mexico can receive for capital murder is 50 years. Since Mexico's judicial system does not have parole, it allows for prisoners to file motions at an appeal court to reduce their sentences after several years. If this condition is denied or granted, inmates can then push for a writ of amparo.|$|E

[...] Coe asked Princess Anne, a British member of the IOC and LOCOG, what she thought, {{and she told him}} to ask the Queen. [...] Coe presented the idea to the Queen's Deputy Private Secretary. [...] Boyle was surprised <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Queen would be happy to play herself, and wanted a speaking part.

500|$|On his return, Lafayette {{found the}} American cause {{at a low}} ebb, rocked by several {{military}} defeats, especially in the south. Lafayette was greeted in Boston with enthusiasm, seen as [...] "a {{knight in shining armor}} from the chivalric past, come to save the nation". He journeyed southwest and on 10 May 1780 had a joyous reunion with Washington at Morristown, New Jersey. The general and his officers were delighted <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> large French force promised to Lafayette would be coming to their aid. Washington, aware of Lafayette's popularity, had him write (with Alexander Hamilton to correct his spelling) to state officials to urge them to provide more troops and provisions to the Continental Army. This bore fruit in the coming months, as Lafayette awaited the arrival of the French fleet. However, when the fleet arrived, there were fewer men and supplies than expected, and Rochambeau decided to wait for reinforcements before seeking battle with the British. [...] This was unsatisfactory to Lafayette, who proposed grandiose schemes for the taking of New York City and other areas, and Rochambeau briefly refused to receive Lafayette until the young man apologized. Washington counseled the marquis to be patient.|$|E

[...] "Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying," [...] he recalled.
