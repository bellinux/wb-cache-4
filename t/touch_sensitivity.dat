5|$|The Nintendo DS's two screens {{act as one}} tall screen; however, in practice, this {{essentially}} {{just gives}} the player {{a better view of}} the surroundings and, save for one boss battle, (Hector the Reflector, where the bottom screen acts as a mirror through which to see Hector during the battle) only provides the benefit of being able to see more (above) and, when the player is on the top screen, below. The game does not make use of the bottom screen's <b>touch</b> <b>sensitivity</b> for basic gameplay, though it is an option for selecting levels and in some mini-games. Each of DSs five worlds has two bosses, each with a weakness that must be identified and exploited.

[...] Hum is effectively cancelled by connecting both coils out of phase; however, as with all common stacks {{there is a large}} degree of magnetic coupling between the coils and string signal is cancelled along with the hum.

2500|$|Velocity {{sensitivity}} (also {{found under}} the keyword <b>touch</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in some manuals): While {{the least expensive}} keyboards are simply [...] "on-off" [...] switches, mid-range and higher-range instruments simulate the process of sound generation in chordophones (string instruments) which {{are sensitive to the}} speed (or [...] "hardness") of a key press. Mid-range instruments may only have two or three levels of sensitivity (e.g., soft-medium-loud). More expensive models may have a broader range of sensitivity. For implementation, two sensors are installed for each key: the first sensor detects when a key is beginning to be pressed and the other triggers when the key is pressed completely. On some higher-end electronic keyboards or digital pianos, a third sensor is installed. This third sensor allows the player to strike a key and still sound a note even when the key has not yet come to its full resting position, allowing for faster (and more accurate) playing of repeated notes. The time between the two (or three) signals allows a keyboard to determine the velocity with which the key was struck. As the key weight is constant this velocity can be considered as the strength of the press. Based on this value the sound generator produces a correspondingly loud or soft sound. The least sophisticated types of <b>touch</b> <b>sensitivity</b> cause the keyboard to change the volume of the instrument voice. The most sophisticated, expensive types will trigger both a change in volume and a change in timbre, which simulates the way that very hard strikes of a piano or electric piano cause a difference in tone—as well as an increase in volume. Some sophisticated touch-sensitivity systems accomplish this by having several samples of an acoustic instrument note per key (e.g., a soft strike, a mid-level strike, and a hard strike). Alternatively, a similar effect can be accomplished using synthesis-modelling of the ADSR envelope or digital modelling (e.g., for the hard strike, the keyboard would add the timbres associated with a hard strike—in the case of a Fender Rhodes voice, this would be a biting, [...] "bark" [...] sound).|$|E

A term “eating capability” {{has been proposed}} to measure objectively how capable an elderly individual is in overall food management. Our objectives were to establish feasible methodologies of eating capability assessment, examine correlations between hand and oro-facial muscle strengths and grade elderly subjects into groups based on their eating capabilities. This study was performed with 203 elderly subjects living in UK (n= 103, 7 community centres, 2 sheltered accommodation) and Spain (n= 100, 3 nursing homes, 1 community centre). Hand gripping force, finger gripping force, biting force, lip sealing pressure, tongue pressing pressure and <b>touching</b> <b>sensitivity</b> were measured for elderly subjects. Measured parameters were normalised and scored between 1 to 5, with 1 being the weakest. Subjects were then grouped into 4 groups based on their eating capability scores, being participants of cluster 1 the weakest group and 4 the strongest. Perception of oral processing difficulty was assessed by showing food images. Hand gripping force showed a strong linear correlation with tongue pressure (UK: 0. 35; Spain: 0. 326) and biting force (UK : 0. 351; Spain: 0. 427). Biting force was strongly dependent on the denture status. Elderly {{of the first three}} groups perceived food products with more hardness and/or fibrous structure as difficult to process orally. The objective measurements of various physiological factors enabled quantitative characterisation of the eating capabilities of elderly people. The observed relationship between hand and oro-facial muscle strengths provides possibility of using non-invasive hand gripping force measurement for eating capability assessment...|$|R

In parallel, non-adherence to medical treatment might lead to severe consequences. Therefore, a solution to monitor PD symptoms, allowing neurologists {{to make informed decisions}} about medication adjustments, and one which could promote medical treatment adherence would be beneficial for both the patient and the medical doctor. In this paper we present the rationale and user-centred process for the design of four smartphone applications for the self-management of PD.

50|$|Though Rococo {{originated}} in the purely decorative arts, the style showed clearly in painting. These painters used delicate colors and curving forms, decorating their canvases with cherubs and myths of love. Portraiture was also popular among Rococo painters. Some works depict a sort of naughtiness or impurity {{in the behavior of}} their subjects, indicating a departure from the Baroque's church/state orientation. Landscapes were pastoral and often depicted the leisurely outings of aristocratic couples.Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684-1721) is generally considered the first great Rococo painter. He had a great influence on later painters, including François Boucher (1703-1770) and Jean-Honoré Fragonard (1732-1806), two masters of the late period. Even Thomas Gainsborough's (1727-1788) delicate <b>touch</b> and <b>sensitivity</b> are reflective of the Rococo spirit. Élisabeth Louise Vigée-Le Brun's (1755-1842) style also shows a great deal of Rococo influence, particularly in her portraits of Marie Antoinette. Other Rococo painters include: Jean François de Troy (1679-1752), Jean-Baptiste van Loo (1685-1745), his two sons Louis-Michel van Loo (1707-1771) and Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo (1719-1795), his younger brother Charles-André van Loo (1705-1765), and Nicolas Lancret (1690-1743). Both Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin (1699-1779) and Jean-Baptiste Greuze (1725-1805), were important French painters of the Rococo era who are considered Anti-Rococo.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A new tuning {{method for}} PID {{controller}} design is proposed {{for a class}} of unknown, stable, and minimum phase plants. We are able to design a PID controller {{to ensure that the}} phase Bode plot is flat, i. e., the phase derivative w. r. t. the frequency is zero, at a given frequency called the “tangent frequency ” so that the closed-loop system is robust to gain variations and the step responses exhibit an isodamping property. At the “tangent frequency”, the Nyquist curve tangentially <b>touches</b> the <b>sensitivity</b> circle. Several relay feedback tests are used to identify the plant gain and phase at the tangent frequency in an iterative way. The identified plant gain and phase at the desired tangent frequency are used to estimate the derivatives of amplitude and phase of the plant with respect to frequency at the same frequency point by Bode’s integral relationship. Then, these derivatives are used to design a PID controller for slope adjustment of the Nyquist plot to achieve the robustness of the system to gain variations. No plant model is assumed during the PID controller design. Only several relay tests are needed. Simulation examples illustrate the effectiveness and the simplicity of the proposed method for robust PID controller design with an iso-damping property. Index Terms — PID controller, PID tuning, relay feedback test, Bode’s integral, flat phase condition, iso-damping property. I...|$|R
