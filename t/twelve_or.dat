5|$|Potemkin had no {{legitimate}} descendants, {{though it}} is probable he had illegitimate issue. Four of his five sisters {{lived long enough to}} bear children, but only the daughters of his sister Marfa Elena (sometimes rendered as 'Helen') received Potemkin's special attention. The five unmarried Engelhardt sisters arrived in court in 1775 on the direction of their recently widowed father Vassily. Legend suggests Potemkin soon seduced many of the girls, one of whom was <b>twelve</b> <b>or</b> thirteen at the time. An affair with the third eldest, Varvara, can be verified; after that had subsided, Potemkin formed close—and probably amorous—relationships successively with Alexandra, the second eldest, and Ekaterina, the fifth.|$|E

During a race, vehicles can sustain damage from collisions, which can subsequently be repaired at intervals after every two events.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Disney {{contracted}} with the Stratemeyer Syndicate and Grosset & Dunlap to produce two Hardy Boys TV serials, starring Tim Considine and Tommy Kirk. The {{first of the}} serials, The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure, was aired on The Mickey Mouse Club in 1956 during the show's second season. To appeal to the show's audience, the Hardy Boys were portrayed as younger than in the books, seeming to be <b>twelve</b> <b>or</b> thirteenyears old (Considine was 15 and Kirk was 14 during filming). The script, written by Jackson Gillis, {{was based on the}} first Hardy Boys book, The Tower Treasure, and the serial was aired in 19episodes of fifteen minutes each with production costs of $5,700. A second serial, The Mystery of Ghost Farm, followed in 1957, with an original story by Jackson Gillis. However, for unknown reasons, no more serials were produced.|$|E
