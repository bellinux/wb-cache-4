Relays can extend the communication on the MAC layer beyond the radio range. For power conservation, a node may set up a specific wake up pattern.

These nodes are called p-savers and need so called p-supporters that contain information about wake up patterns of all the p-savers they are responsible for. A p-supporter only forwards data to a p-saver at the moment p-saver is awake. This action also requires buffering mechanisms for packets on p-supporting forwaders.|$|E

Most multi-hop wireless routing protocols are adopted from wired network routing protocols and use pre-selected single or multiple minimum cost paths <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>data</b> <b>packets.</b> However unlike wired networks, a wireless network has unique characteristics such as unreliable wireless links and multiple receivers associated with a single packet transmission.

To further reduce the overhead of control message, we introduce a novel greedy forwarding algorithm and an efficient self-suppression scheme. Extensive analysis and simulations show that E 2 R can provide high packet delivery ratio and effectively reduce redundant packet transmissions which results in less energy consumption. I...|$|E
