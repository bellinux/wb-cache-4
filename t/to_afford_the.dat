5|$|Following {{the death}} of Alexander Luttrell in 1944, the family was unable <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> death duties on his estate. The castle and {{surrounding}} lands were sold off to a property firm, the family continuing {{to live in the}} castle as tenants. The Luttrells bought back the castle in 1954, but in 1976 Colonel Walter Luttrell gave Dunster Castle and most of its contents to the National Trust, which operates it as a tourist attraction. It is a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument.|$|E

5|$|Louis XVIII {{encouraged}} {{his niece}} {{to write her}} memoirs, as he wished them {{to be used as}} Bourbon propaganda. In 1796 and 1803, Louis also used the diaries of Louis XVI's final attendants in the same way. In January 1801, Tsar Paul told Louis XVIII that he could no longer live in Russia. The court at Jelgava was so low on funds that it had to auction some of its possessions <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> journey out of Russia.

5|$|By 1849, {{many of the}} Latter-day Saints who {{remained}} in Iowa or Missouri were poor and unable <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> costs of the wagon, teams of oxen, and supplies {{that would be required}} for the trip. Therefore, the LDS Church established a revolving fund, known as the Perpetual Emigration Fund, to enable the poor to emigrate. By 1852, most of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo who wished to emigrate had done so, and the church abandoned its settlements in Iowa. However, many church members from the eastern states and from Europe continued to emigrate to Utah, often assisted by the Perpetual Emigration Fund.|$|E
5|$|By July 2011, Rohrer had {{submitted}} a beta {{version of the}} game for Nintendo approval. This was followed up with the master version in October. An issue raised during the approval process was Rohrer's desire to credit Bailey on the game's cover, which Nintendo rejected. He got around this by officially naming the game Jason Rohrer with Music by Tom Bailey: Diamond Trust of London. In May 2012, the game was ready for manufacturing. However, due to changing market conditions, Zoo Publishing was no longer able <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> manufacturing of cartridges given the large minimum order of 6,000 units that Nintendo required, and so, Rohrer turned to the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.|$|E

5|$|Fred Keenor {{was born}} in Cardiff, Wales, as one of eleven children. He {{was raised in the}} family home, a terraced house in Theodora Street in Roath, a suburb in Cardiff, by his father Robert Keenor and his mother Mary. His father worked as a stonemason in the city, working long hours {{in order to be able}} <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> {{employment}} of Elizabeth Maler, a live-in nanny, to help his wife care for their children. Although they were not regarded as being in poverty, the family lived in cramped conditions, Keenor sharing a bedroom with three of his brothers in a house which did not have an inside toilet.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{was born}} on May 15, 1918 in Brooklyn. He first started {{shooting}} during the seventh grade, when his hobby of shooting marbles cost him his job at a dry cleaning and tailoring shop. He attended Brooklyn Technical High School, where he joined the rifle team after saving for a year <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> fifteen cent ammunition fee for the tryouts. He won his first team event in 1934 at a tournament in New Haven, Connecticut, obtaining individual honors in the process, and followed it up in 1936 with a group trophy and another individual accolade at a competition held at his high school and sponsored by the New York Stock Exchange. Following graduation, he briefly worked at General Motors prior to taking up a position at an engineering firm that specialized in diesel engines.|$|E

5|$|Walsh missed {{two weeks}} of the 1991–92 {{pre-season}} with a groin injury, and on his first game back for the reserves at White Hart Lane punched reserve team manager Ray Clemence in the face after Clemence substituted him off after an hour. Walsh was suspended for two weeks and upon his return was loaned out to Queens Park Rangers for a month. QPR manager Gerry Francis wanted to make the signing a permanent one, but the club were unable <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> £800,000 fee Spurs had asked for. After returning to Spurs he again punched someone in the face, this time a supporter who had shouted abuse to Walsh on the pitch after a game against Norwich City. He ended the campaign with three goals in 22 starts and 15 substitute appearances.|$|E
5|$|After landing, Young and Duke began {{powering}} {{down some of}} the LM's systems to conserve battery power. Upon completing their initial adjustments, the pair configured Orion for their three-day stay on the lunar surface, removed their space suits and took initial geological observations of the immediate landing site. They then settled down for their first meal on the surface. After eating, they configured the cabin for their first sleep period on the Moon. The landing delay caused by the malfunction in the Command/Service Module's main engine necessitated significant modifications to the mission schedule. Apollo 16 would spend one less day in lunar orbit after surface exploration had been completed <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> crew contingency time to compensate for any further problems and to conserve expendables. In order to improve Young's and Duke's sleep schedule, the third and final moonwalk of the mission was trimmed from seven hours to five.|$|E
5|$|Fingleton {{was unable}} to {{distinguish}} himself on the field while at school, but after joining Waverley, he made quick progress. Fingleton trained early in the morning, before heading {{to the office and}} working in the afternoon so that the articles would be printed in the evening. He was unable <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> club membership so a patron sponsored him. At the age of 16, he broke into the First XI of a grade team which included Test players Alan Kippax, Hanson Carter and Arthur Mailey. Australian Test captain Herbie Collins missed a match due to his work as a bookmaker, and Fingleton stood in at late notice. Under the leadership of Carter, Fingleton batted last and made 11 not out. Forced to follow on, he made 52 not out and cemented his position {{for the remainder of the}} season. Within a year, Fingleton's grade performances were being reported in Sydney newspapers. Playing on a Waverley pitch notorious for uneven bounce, Fingleton developed a style of playe centred around solid defence.|$|E

5|$|In {{accordance}} with changes {{made for the}} 1924 final onwards, all tickets were sold in advance to prevent {{a repeat of the}} overcrowding at the 1923 final. Approximately 91,000 tickets were available. 53,000 were standing tickets, 15,000 were uncovered seats and 23,000 were covered seats. Standing tickets cost two shillings, seat prices ranged from five shillings to one guinea. The majority of tickets were sold before the finalists were known. As a result, few supporters of the participating teams attended; most were unable <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> remaining tickets available to the general public, which were typically in the more expensive areas of the stadium. 1,750 tickets were allocated directly to each club. Bolton fielded 6,000 enquiries and lodged a formal protest about the inadequacy of their allocation. The London, Midland and Scottish Railway laid on a total of seven special trains from Manchester to London on the eve and morning of the match. A number of supporters travelled to London without tickets in the hope of securing one outside the stadium. 5s tickets changed hands for up to 15s, provoking the ire of ticketless supporters who accused the sellers of profiteering. In one such instance, a man selling twenty 2s tic|kets at 10s each required the assistance of five police officers to escape the wrath of the crowd. The total gate receipts for the match were £23,157, a new record.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner {{proposed}} a fiscal austerity program in early 2012, including the gradual removal of subsidies. The proposal {{turned out to}} be unpopular, and was not implemented. She opted instead to send a bill to Congress for the renationalization of YPF, privatized in 1993, blaming the Spanish company Repsol for the energy trade deficit. The bill was approved by the Chamber of Deputies by a 207-32 margin. It was criticized as an authoritarian move, as there was no negotiation with Repsol. As well, the Vaca Muerta oil field had been discovered by this time. However, YPF was unable <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> costs to exploit the oil at the site, and the rights to drill at Vaca Muerta were sold to the Chevron Corporation. The costs of energy imports increased the trade deficit and the inflation rate, and power outages became frequent. Outages usually took place on the hottest days of the summer season, as the use of air conditioning increased electricity consumption to peak levels.|$|E
5|$|The men aboard Queen Mary were {{originally}} {{destined for the}} Middle East but {{a decision was made}} mid-voyage to divert them to the United Kingdom, {{as part of a larger}} contingent of Australians that were sent to help bolster the defences there. After making the long passage via Fremantle, Cape Town, and Freetown, the Queen Mary arrived off the coast off Gourock, Scotland, on 16 June. The evacuation at Dunkirk had been achieved just two weeks earlier and France had just fallen: Britain was now preparing for a potential cross-Channel invasion. The Australian troops from the 18th Brigade and, eventually, the 25th Brigade, along with various supporting arms, had been despatched to help bolster the island's defences. From Gourock, they entrained and moved south to Tidworth Camp on Salisbury Plain. They remained in Britain for much of the rest of the year, undertaking training, mounting guard, conducting patrols and exercises. A move to Colchester took place in October <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>the</b> Australians a more permanent barracks for the coming winter, as they were mainly under canvas at Tidworth. The following month, as the threat of invasion seemingly passed, they received orders to move to Glasgow to embark on the transport Otrango, bound for the Middle East where they were to rejoin the rest of the 6th Division.|$|E
