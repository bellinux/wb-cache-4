2500|$|In December 1973, Carson joked on <b>Tonight</b> <b>about</b> {{an alleged}} {{shortage}} of toilet paper. Panic buying and hoarding ensued across the United States as consumers emptied stores, causing a real shortage {{that lasted for}} weeks. Stores and toilet paper manufacturers had to ration supplies until the panic ended. Carson apologized in January 1974 for the incident, which became what The New York Times called a [...] "classic study" [...] of how rumors spread.|$|E
2500|$|Scott went on {{to study}} at the Royal College of Art in London, {{contributing}} to college magazine ARK and helping to establish the college film department. For his final show, he made {{a black and white}} short film, Boy and Bicycle, starring both his younger brother and his father (the film was later released on the [...] "Extras" [...] section of The Duellists DVD). In February 1963 Scott was named in title credits as [...] "Designer" [...] for the BBC television programme <b>Tonight,</b> <b>about</b> the severe winter of 1963. After graduation in 1963, he secured a job as a trainee set designer with the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police series Z-Cars and science fiction series Out of the Unknown. He was originally assigned to design the second Doctor Who serial, The Daleks, which would have entailed realising the serial's eponymous alien creatures. However, shortly before Scott was due to start work, a schedule conflict meant he was replaced by Raymond Cusick. In 1965, he began directing episodes of television series for the BBC, only one of which, an episode of Adam Adamant Lives!, is available commercially.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the origin}} of the term [...] "Claymates" [...] is unknown, Aiken trademarked the term. While in Los Angeles in September 2006 for a CD signing and {{appearance}} on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Aiken talked with Jann Carl of Entertainment <b>Tonight</b> <b>about</b> the names various sub-groups have given themselves: [...] "Claysians" [...] (Asian fans), [...] "Claynadians" [...] (Canadian fans), [...] "Clayropeans" [...] (European fans) and [...] "Claydawgs" [...] (male fans). She then teased him about having his own [...] "Clay Nation". At the CD signing, two young fans asked Clay to autograph their shoulderblades and then went to the local tattoo parlor to make them permanent; later that day on Jimmy Kimmel Live! they were brought on stage to show the tattoos. Although some of his fans have been criticized at times by the media as being obsessive, he defends the group as a whole. When Kimmel said to Aiken that his fans were [...] "crazy", Aiken stated that they were merely [...] "enthusiastic". In 2003, in anticipation of the release of Measure of a Man, fans all over the country decided to get together and hold parties to celebrate the release of the CD and purchase copies at midnight. In 2006, for the release of A Thousand Different Ways, release parties were held in more than 80 cities in the United States, Canada, and Singapore.|$|E

6000|$|... "I suppose I {{ought to}} be more {{concerned}} <b>tonight</b> <b>about</b> the work I have to do in the world and anxious for you to tell me this and that, but indeed I am not concerned at all about it. I seem to have it in outline all perfectly clear. I mean to play a man's part in the world just as my father wants me to do. I mean to win his confidence and work with him--like a partner. Then some day I shall be a power in the world of fuel. And at the same time I must watch and read and think and learn how to be the servant of the world.... We two have to live like trusted servants who have been made guardians of a helpless minor. We have to put things in order and keep them in order against the time when Man--Man whom we call in America the Common Man--can take hold of his world--" ...|$|E

He came indoors <b>tonight</b> <b>about</b> eight o'clock and said in an off-hand way, 'Tamsie, I have just found that I must go a journey.' 'When?' I said. 'Tonight,' he said. 'Where?' I asked him. 'I cannot tell you at present,' he said; 'I shall be back again tomorrow.' He then went and busied himself in looking up his things, and took no notice of me at all. I {{expected}} to see him start, but he did not, and then it came to be ten o'clock, when he said, 'You had better go to bed.' I didn't know what to do, and I went to bed. I believe he thought I fell asleep, for half an hour after that he came up and unlocked the oak chest we keep money in when we have much in the house and took out a roll of something which I believe was bank-notes, though I was not aware that he had 'em there. These he must have got from the bank when he went there the other day. What does he want bank-notes for, if he is only going off for a day? When he had gone down I thought of Eustacia, and how he had met her the night before--I know he did meet her, Clym, for I followed him part of the way; but I did not like to tell you when you called, and so make you think ill of him, as I did not think it was so serious. Then I could not stay in bed; I got up and dressed myself, and when I heard him out in the stable I thought I would come and tell you. So I came downstairs without any noise and slipped out." ...|$|E
