5|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} {{from a number}} of people that the highly fragmented DG structure wastes a considerable amount of time in s as the different departments and Commissioners compete with each other.

5|$|Ambassador Bishop {{requested}} {{an evacuation}} of the American community on 1 January, {{indicating that the}} evacuation could be with the planned Italian, French, or German evacuation efforts, but preferred an evacuation by the US military. The State Department authorized the evacuation on 2 January and on that day, Ambassador Bishop specifically requested an evacuation by the US military, thereby initiating Operation Eastern Exit. Ambassador Bishop had spent {{a considerable amount of}} time discussing contingency plans for evacuation with other diplomatic posts. Ultimately, ten heads of missions—eight ambassadors and two chargés d'affaires—along with <b>their</b> <b>staff</b> sought refuge in the US embassy compound and were evacuated.|$|E

5|$|The HV {{continued}} to grow, numbering about 200,000 troops {{by the end}} of 1991. Although the force successfully countered the JNA that year, the HV was deficient in organisation, training and heavy-weapons support. By the end of 1991, the HV still lacked sufficient resources to push back the JNA and continued experiencing inadequate work by <b>their</b> <b>staff.</b> Nonetheless, like the ZNG it benefited from its troops' high morale and the well-defined purpose of its mission. The growth and systematic improvement of HV capability accelerated in 1992, continuing throughout the Croatian War of Independence. The anniversary of the ZNG parade at the Kranjčevićeva Street Stadium is celebrated annually in Croatia as Armed Forces Day and Croatian Army Day.|$|E

5|$|Where possible, the University of Chicago {{attempted}} to re-employ workers {{who had been}} transferred from the Metallurgical Laboratory to other projects once their work had ended.

Across Kilver Street (the A37) is Kilver Court, which {{over the course of}} the 20th century has been a factory, the headquarters of the Showerings brewing business, and then the headquarters of a leather-goods manufacturer, Mulberry. Behind are the , originally built by Showerings for the recreation of <b>their</b> <b>staff</b> and set against the backdrop of part of the Charlton Viaduct. The gardens are now open to the public.

5000|$|There {{was also}} a {{short-lived}} comic book series, Visionaries, published by Star Comics and eventually Marvel Comics - it lasted only 6 issues, and was cancelled midway through a 4-part adventure. The first issue was an adaptation of the first episode, [...] "The Age Of Magic Begins", but the subsequent issues took the storyline in a different direction. There were a few differences in details - whereas in the cartoon, the staff-bearing knights had only one use of <b>their</b> <b>staffs</b> before needing a recharge, in the comics, they could use <b>their</b> <b>staffs</b> {{as often as they}} liked. In one issue, Witterquick and Cindarr crossed <b>their</b> <b>staffs</b> to combine <b>their</b> powers, the combination of light speed and destruction creating an earthquake. Another difference concerned the animal totems - the characters worried that they might lose control of their animal forms while in them.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{accession}} William Rufus gave the town, with the lands adjacent, to the see of Durham, and, under the patronage {{of the bishops}} of that diocese, it grew in importance, and became an episcopal residence. In 1130 a castle {{was built on the}} west side of the town adjacent to North Beck by Bishop Rufus and was expanded in 1142 after William Cumin seized the Bishopric of Durham in 1141. The castle was further expanded in 1173 by Hugh Pudsey and garrisoned by a group of Flemish soldiers, an act which enraged King Henry II who ordered that it be razed to the ground in 1177. A more substantial fortified palace surrounded by a moat was built on the same site in 1199 replacing the traditional motte-and-bailey castle. The palace became an important administrative centre for the bishops' lands in Yorkshire and served as a major residence for the bishops and <b>their</b> <b>staff.</b> The palace lay on the main road from York to Durham and was a regular stopping place for royalty and other dignitaries. The palace fell into ruin by 1658 and the site is now a cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The Autonomist Party's base grew rapidly, in {{part due}} to Muñoz Rivera's {{writings}} and speeches directed toward the jíbaro population. The Conservative Party considered this a threat and closed the newspapers where he published his work, sending part of <b>their</b> <b>staff</b> to jail in Fort San Felipe del Morro. After Francisco Cepeda Taborcias, editor of La Revista de Puerto Rico's was jailed, the position was offered to Muñoz Rivera, who accepted it. After being released from prison, Cepeda criticized Baldorioty de Castro's policies. Cepeda was elected secretary of the party and Baldorioty de Castro was named honorary president. This action angered Muñoz Rivera, who challenged him to a duel. Cepeda originally accepted the challenge, but later declined the same once the preparations were underway, losing his position within the party's hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{brought in}} a European Red Cross {{committee}} called the Katyn Commission, comprising 12 forensic experts and <b>their</b> <b>staff,</b> from Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, and Slovakia. The Germans were so intent on proving that the Soviets were behind the massacre that they even included some Allied prisoners of war, among them writer Ferdynand Goetel, the Polish Home Army prisoner from Pawiak. After the war, Goetel escaped with a fake passport due to an arrest warrant issued against him. Jan Emil Skiwski was a collaborator. Józef Mackiewicz has published several texts about the crime. Two of the 12, the Bulgarian Marko Markov and the Czech František Hájek, with their countries becoming satellite states of the Soviet Union, were forced to recant their evidence, defending the Soviets and blaming the Germans. The Croatian pathologist Eduard Miloslavić managed to escape to the USA.|$|E
