To accommodate the $30 million budget, Clooney convinced Drew Barrymore and Julia Roberts <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>their</b> salaries. The film was released to respectful reviews from critics and was modestly successful at the box office. Rockwell, in particular, was praised for his acting and won the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 2003 Berlin International Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|Any {{extended}} ocean voyage without {{fresh water}} or food would prove {{difficult for a}} large, warm-blooded (homeothermic) mammal, but today many small, nocturnal species of lemur exhibit heterothermy, which allows them <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>their</b> metabolism and become dormant while living off fat reserves. Such a trait in a small, nocturnal lemur ancestor would have facilitated the ocean voyage and could have been passed on to its descendants. However, this trait has not been observed in the closely related lorisoids studied to date, and could have evolved on Madagascar {{in response to the}} island's harsh environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|Crispi’s good {{intentions}} {{got lost in}} the outcry for strong measures. In the three weeks of uncertainty before the government was formed, the rapid spread of violence drove many local authorities to defy Giolitti’s ban on the use of firearms. In December 1893, 92 peasants lost their lives in clashes with the police and army. Government building were burned as well as flour mills and bakeries that refused <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>their</b> prices when taxes were lowered or abolished. Eleven people were killed on December 10, 1893, in Giardinello after a rally that asked for the abolition of taxes on food and disbandment of the local field guards (guardie campestri). The protestors carried the portrait of the King taken from the municipality and burned tax files. On December 17, 1893, many people were wounded when troops fired on a manifestation in Monreale. Another 11 protestors were killed in Lercara Friddi on December 25. On January 1, 1894, 20 people were killed and many wounded in Gibellina and Pietraperzia. On January 2, there two dead in Belmonte Mezzagno and the next day 18 dead and many wounded in Marineo. Two days after, on January 5, thirteen dead and many wounded closed the series in Santa Caterina.|$|E
50|$|Cap-and-trade schemes are {{programs}} {{under which}} member companies commit <b>to</b> <b>lowering</b> <b>their</b> {{greenhouse gas emissions}} by a certain amount in {{a certain period of}} time and trade carbon credits generated by this.

5|$|Once the 1976 Formula One World Championship season {{got under}} way Pryce {{instantly}} added a second podium finish to his tally, at the first round in Brazil. This came {{at the expense of}} continuing team mate Jarier, who was caught out by oil on the track from James Hunt's McLaren. Both Shadows enjoyed reasonable competitiveness during the next two races at Kyalami and Long Beach. Changes in car regulations, meaning that teams had <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>their</b> airboxes and mount the cars' rear wings further forward, along with revised Goodyear tyres, meant the Shadow DN5B lost much of its competitiveness; Pryce still achieved a second points scoring finish of the season in Britain. The new Shadow DN8 was not introduced until the twelfth round at Zandvoort, where Pryce qualified the new car in third, and finished the race only one place lower in fourth: it was the last points scoring finish of his career. The Welshman finished his last full season 12th in the Drivers' Championship with 10 points, 59 points behind World Champion James Hunt.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Commander Eugene Esmonde, {{acting as}} Squadron Leader, No. 825 Squadron FAA {{took off with}} his Fairey Swordfish {{formation}} at 12:25 to attack the ships. No. 411 and 64 Squadron were to escort the FAA but arrived over Manston 15 minutes late and missed the rendezvous. The only unit to keep to mission orders was Squadron Leader Brian Kingcome's No. 72 Squadron. Unaware of the Swordfish squadron's location, they ran into each other by fortunate accident. Owing to low cloud cover, they dropped to between 50 and 100 feet. The heavy German fighter cover {{put an end to}} the protection the Spitfire's could provide as the RAF fighters now had to look after themselves. The Spitfires and Swordfish were engaged by Fw 190s of 8 staffel and 9 staffel./JG 26 led by Gruppenkommandeur (Group Commander) Gerhard Schöpfel of III./JG 26. The Fw 190s were just relieving fighters of JG 2. Frail and slow, the Swordfish forced German pilots <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>their</b> undercarriages to prevent overshooting the biplanes. In the event all six Swordfish were shot down. The Spitfires destroyed three Fw 190s in return. Several Swordfish managed to fire off their torpedoes but none found their mark. Lieutenant Commander Esmonde was shot down and killed by an Fw 190. He was awarded the Victoria Cross. Only five of the original eighteen Swordfish crew survived. No. 41 Squadron RAF claimed three Bf 109s (most likely from JG 1) destroyed and one damaged off the Belgian coast. No. 72 Squadron claimed three Fw 190s destroyed and four damaged in the battles around 13:00. No. 410 Squadron claimed two Bf 109s destroyed and two damaged in the same dogfights. The German ships consumed very little ammunition, as the action had been carried out largely by the Luftwaffe.|$|E

25|$|The {{state of}} California enacted a law, {{effective}} January 1, 1999, that overrode Santa Monica's rent control ordinance by mandating vacancy decontrol.

25|$|ARMs {{generally}} permit borrowers <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>their</b> initial payments if {{they are}} willing to assume the risk of interest rate changes. There is evidence that consumers tend to prefer contracts with the lowest initial rates, such as in the UK where consumers tend to focus on immediate monthly mortgage costs. Decisions of consumers may also be affected by the advice they get, and much of the advice is provided by lenders who may prefer ARMs because of financial market structures.|$|E
25|$|A 2009 {{study found}} that {{drinking}} from polycarbonate bottles increased urinary bisphenolA levels by two thirds, from 1.2 μg/g creatinine to 2 μg/g creatinine.

25|$|Canopies {{for each}} cardinal-elector were once used during conclaves—a sign of equal dignity.

Until reforms instituted by Saint Pius X, the canopies were of different colours to designate which Cardinals had been appointed by which Pope. Paul VI abolished the canopies altogether, since, under his papacy, {{the population of the}} College of Cardinals had increased so much {{to the point that they}} would need to be seated in rows of two against the walls, making the canopies obstruct the view of the cardinals in the back row.|$|E

25|$|In reconstituting the Byzantine Empire Michael VIII {{restored}} the old administration without endeavouring to correct its failures.

This policy led to the gradual collapse of the frontier, which was infiltrated by Turkish bands even before the death of Michael VIII in Pachomios village, Thrace in December 1282. The Palaiologan dynasty he established ruled the Byzantine Empire for almost two centuries, longer {{than any other in}} Roman history.

25|$|Gallium and its {{derivatives}} {{have only}} found applications in recent decades. Gallium arsenide {{has been used}} in semiconductors, in amplifiers, in solar cells (for example in satellites) and in tunnel diodes for FM transmitter circuits.

25|$|On 19 April 2004, {{the unusually}} large rate of {{increase}} in atmospheric pressure led to an airlock and failure of hydraulic pressure on eight of the Class 357 trains which caused their computer's software <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>their</b> pantographs and so be unable to collect power from the overhead lines, causing service disruption.

In 1950, the average American consumed 10 percent more food than in 1930, with poorer households enjoying an especially important improvement {{in the quality of}} the food they consumed. John Kenneth Galbraith supported this contention in his 1952 book, American Capitalism, by citing A as an example of countervailing power. To support his thesis, he discussed a 1937 A study of the feasibility of opening a plant to manufacture corn flakes.

40|$|Cost {{inefficiency}} {{of banks}} {{in many countries}} is quite high. Financial sector reforms in India are also aimed at improving efficiency, productivity and profitability of banks via increased competitiveness. An assessment based on a fairly general framework in the Indian context has found that cost inefficiency of domestic banks in the post-reforms period is not very high. Data also supports a declining trend in inefficiency over time. Slightly higher average inefficiency in public sector banks points to a need for granting more autonomy and instituting a pro-per incentive structure.
