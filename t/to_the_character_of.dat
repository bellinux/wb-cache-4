In this form the prodromal illness still occurred {{but may be}} less severe than in the ordinary type. There is usually no fever during evolution of the rash. The skin lesions tended to be fewer and evolve more quickly, are more superficial, and may not show the uniform characteristic of more typical smallpox. Modified smallpox was rarely, if ever, fatal. This form of variola major is more easily confused with chickenpox.|$|E
5|$|These {{plans were}} {{extremely}} controversial. All three envisaged {{reducing the number}} of stalls from 205 to 140–160 to increase space, and all three involved splitting the market into isolated clusters of stalls, significantly altering its character and appearance. The Eastern Daily Press organised a campaign against the perceived unattractiveness of the designs, the proposed {{reduction in the number of}} stalls which would mean stallholders losing their jobs and the remaining stallholders facing rent increases to cover the difference, and the change <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> central Norwich that such a radical redesign of the market would entail. A petition of over 12,000 signatories rejecting all three proposed designs was gathered.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{gaining the}} {{rights for the}} film Superman, Alexander Salkind and his son, Ilya Salkind, also {{purchased}} the rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> Superman's cousin Supergirl. Supergirl was released in 1984 as a spin-off of the Reeve films; Reeve was slated to have a cameo but he ultimately {{backed out of the}} production. It stars Helen Slater in her first motion picture in the title role, while Faye Dunaway (who received top billing) played the primary villain, Selena; the film also featured Marc McClure reprising his role as Jimmy Olsen. Even though the film performed poorly at the box office, Helen Slater was nominated for a Saturn Award.|$|E

5|$|Ventus was {{designed}} by director Tetsuya Nomura who {{wanted to create a}} character with an important connection with the series' main character Sora. Ventus bears a strong resemblance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> Roxas, both of whom are voiced by Kōki Uchiyama in Japanese and Jesse McCartney in English. After Ventus' first cameo, Nomura had to state that both of them are different characters, and the reason for such connection would be revealed in Birth by Sleep. Video game websites also commented on Ventus' first appearance, initially confusing him for Roxas during the development of Birth by Sleep, but has since been well received.|$|E

5|$|As of August 1, 2012, Fox was {{pursuing}} a sequel with Scott, Rapace, and Fassbender involved, and {{was talking to}} new writers in case Lindelof did not return. The film would be scheduled for a release no earlier than 2014. In December 2012, Lindelof {{had decided not to}} work on a sequel, citing other commitments. In June 2013, Jack Paglen was in negotiations to write the sequel. In October 2013, Scott confirmed that the script was complete, but in March 2014, Michael Green was hired to rewrite Paglen's script. In August 2015, it was announced that production for the film would begin in January 2016 with Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace reprising their roles, and Scott directing. While at the Toronto International Film Festival to promote his film The Martian, Scott stated that production on the film will begin in February 2016. In September 2015, Scott said that the title of the sequel will be Alien: Paradise Lost, an allusion to John Milton's epic poem which may also suggest a deeper connection with the Alien franchise. In an interview with Empire, Scott said that the title change did not affect the film's story and the film will have a connection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> Ellen Ripley.|$|E

5|$|The Best Man Wins is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film features Thanhouser's leading players Anna Rosemond, Martin Faust, Frank H. Crane and Marie Eline in a drama about morality. Two suitors are vying for the hand of Julia Seaton and propose {{to her on the}} same day, but she asks for a month to decide between them. In the time the caliber of both men are tested when asked by a young girl, named May, to help her dying mother. The doctor refuses to help and the lawyer offers his assistance, but her mother soon dies. The orphan is taken in by the Seaton family and personally attests <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> both men when Julia Seaton has to choose between her suitors. The writer, director and cameraman are unknown. Released on May 14, 1910, the film was met with mostly positive reviews by critics. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying {{the depth of the}} engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with {{just the right amount of}} ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E
