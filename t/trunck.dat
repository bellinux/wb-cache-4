Observation, {{consisting}} of a film, extended on certain small stiff wires or bones: these in a blue Fly, were much longer then the body, but in other kind of Flies they are of very differing proportions to the body. These films, in many Flies, were so thin, that, like several other plated bodies (mention'd in the ninth Observation) they afforded all varieties of fantastical or transient colours (the reason of which I have here endeavoured to explain) they seem'd to receive their nourishment from the stalks or wires, which seem'd to be hollow, and neer {{the upper part of}} the wing LL several of them seem'd jointed, the shape of which will sufficiently appear by the black lines in the second Figure of the 26. Scheme, which is a delineation of one of those wings expanded directly to the eyes.|$|E

[...] So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son [...] On his great Expedition now appeer'd, [...] Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown'd [...] Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love [...] Immense, and all his Father in him shon. [...] About his Chariot numberless were pour'd [...] Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones, [...] And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing'd, [...] From the Armoury of God, where stand of old [...] 200 [...] Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg'd [...] Against a solemn day, harnest at hand, [...] Celestial Equipage; and now came forth [...] Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd, [...] Attendant on thir Lord: Heav'n op'nd wide [...] Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound [...] On golden Hinges moving, to let forth [...] The King of Glorie in his powerful Word [...] And Spirit coming to create new Worlds. [...] On heav'nly ground they stood, and from the shore [...] 210 [...] They view'd the vast immeasurable Abyss [...] Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde, [...] Up from the bottom turn'd by furious windes [...] And surging waves, as Mountains to assault [...] Heav'ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole. [...] Silence, ye troubl'd waves, and thou Deep, peace, [...] Said then th' Omnific Word, your discord end: [...] Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim [...] Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode [...] Farr into Chaos, and the World unborn; [...] 220 [...] For Chaos heard his voice: him all his Traine [...] Follow'd in bright procession to behold [...] Creation, and the wonders of his might. [...] Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand [...] He took the golden Compasses, prepar'd [...] In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe [...] This Universe, and all created things: [...] One foot he center'd, and the other turn'd [...] Round through the vast profunditie obscure, [...] And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds, [...] 230 [...] This be thy just Circumference, O World. [...] Thus God the Heav'n created, thus the Earth, [...] Matter unform'd and void: Darkness profound [...] Cover'd th' Abyss: but on the watrie calme [...] His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred, [...] And vital vertue infus'd, and vital warmth [...] Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg'd [...] The black tartareous cold infernal dregs [...] Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob'd [...] Like things to like, the rest to several place [...] 240 [...] Disparted, and between spun out the Air, [...] And Earth self-ballanc't on her Center hung. [...] Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light [...] Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure [...] Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East [...] To journie through the airie gloom began, [...] Sphear'd in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun [...] Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle [...] Sojourn'd the while. God saw the Light was good; [...] And light from darkness by the Hemisphere [...] 250 [...] Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night [...] He nam'd. Thus was the first Day Eev'n and Morn: [...] Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung [...] By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light [...] Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld; [...] Birth-day of Heav'n and Earth; with joy and shout [...] The hollow Universal Orb they fill'd, [...] And touch't thir Golden Harps, & hymning prais'd [...] God and his works, Creatour him they sung, [...] Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn. [...] 260 [...] Again, God said, let ther be Firmament [...] Amid the Waters, and let it divide [...] The Waters from the Waters: and God made [...] The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, [...] Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus'd [...] In circuit to the uttermost convex [...] Of this great Round: partition firm and sure, [...] The Waters underneath from those above [...] Dividing: for as Earth, so hee the World [...] Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide [...] 270 [...] Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule [...] Of Chaos farr remov'd, least fierce extreames [...] Contiguous might distemper the whole frame: [...] And Heav'n he nam'd the Firmament: So Eev'n [...] And Morning Chorus sung the second Day. [...] The Earth was form'd, but in the Womb as yet [...] Of Waters, Embryon immature involv'd, [...] Appeer'd not: over all the face of Earth [...] Main Ocean flow'd, not idle, but with warme [...] Prolific humour soft'ning all her Globe, [...] 280 [...] Fermented the great Mother to conceave, [...] Satiate with genial moisture, when God said [...] Be gather'd now ye Waters under Heav'n [...] Into one place, and let dry Land appeer. [...] Immediately the Mountains huge appeer [...] Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave [...] Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie: [...] So high as heav'd the tumid Hills, so low [...] Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep, [...] Capacious bed of Waters: thither they [...] 290 [...] Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld [...] As drops on dust conglobing from the drie; [...] Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct, [...] For haste; such flight the great command impress'd [...] On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call [...] Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard) [...] Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng, [...] Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found, [...] If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine, [...] Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill, [...] 300 [...] But they, or under ground, or circuit wide [...] With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way, [...] And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore; [...] Easie, e're God had bid the ground be drie, [...] All but within those banks, where Rivers now [...] Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine. [...] The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle [...] Of congregated Waters he call'd Seas: [...] And saw that it was good, and said, Let th' Earth [...] Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yeilding Seed, [...] 310 [...] And Fruit Tree yeilding Fruit after her kind; [...] Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth. [...] He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then [...] Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn'd, [...] Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad [...] Her Universal Face with pleasant green, [...] Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour'd [...] Op'ning thir various colours, and made gay [...] Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown, [...] Forth flourish't thick the clustring Vine, forth crept [...] 320 [...] The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed [...] Embattell'd in her field: add the humble Shrub, [...] And Bush with frizl'd hair implicit: last [...] Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred [...] Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm'd [...] Thir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd, [...] With tufts the vallies & each fountain side, [...] With borders long the Rivers. That Earth now [...] Seemd like to Heav'n, a seat where Gods might dwell, [...] Or wander with delight, and love to haunt [...] 330 [...] Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain'd [...] Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground [...] None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist [...] Went up and waterd all the ground, and each [...] Plant of the field, which e're it was in the Earth [...] God made, and every Herb, before it grew [...] On the green stemm; God saw that it was good: [...] So Eev'n and Morn recorded the Third Day. [...] Again th' Almightie spake: Let there be Lights [...] High in th' expanse of Heaven to divide [...] 340 [...] The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes, [...] For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years, [...] And let them be for Lights as I ordaine [...] Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav'n [...] To give Light on the Earth; and it was so. [...] And God made two great Lights, great for thir use [...] To Man, the greater to have rule by Day, [...] The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs, [...] And set them in the Firmament of Heav'n [...] To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day [...] 350 [...] In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night, [...] And Light from Darkness to divide. God saw, [...] Surveying his great Work, that it was good: [...] For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun [...] A mightie Spheare he fram'd, unlightsom first, [...] Though of Ethereal Mould: then form'd the Moon [...] Globose, and everie magnitude of Starrs, [...] And sowd with Starrs the Heav'n thick as a field: [...] Of Light by farr the greater part he took, [...] Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac'd [...] 360 [...] In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive [...] And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine [...] Her gather'd beams, great Palace now of Light. [...] Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs [...] Repairing, in thir gold'n Urns draw Light, [...] And hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns; [...] By tincture or reflection they augment [...] Thir small peculiar, though from human sight [...] So farr remote, with diminution seen. [...] First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen, [...] 370 [...] Regent of Day, and all th' Horizon round [...] Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run [...] His Longitude through Heav'ns high rode: the gray [...] Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danc'd [...] Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon, [...] But opposite in leveld West was set [...] His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light [...] From him, for other light she needed none [...] In that aspect, and still that distance keepes [...] Till night, then in the East her turn she shines, [...] 380 [...] Revolvd on Heav'ns great Axle, and her Reign [...] With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds, [...] With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer'd [...] Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd [...] With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose, [...] Glad Eevning & glad Morn crownd the fourth day. [...] And God said, let the Waters generate [...] Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule: [...] And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings [...] Displayd on the op'n Firmament of Heav'n. [...] 390 [...] And God created the great Whales, and each [...] Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously [...] The waters generated by thir kindes, [...] And every Bird of wing after his kinde; [...] And saw that it was good, and bless'd them, saying, [...] Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas [...] And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill; [...] And let the Fowle be multiply'd on the Earth. [...] Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek & Bay [...] With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales [...] 400 [...] Of Fish that with thir Finns & shining Scales [...] Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft [...] Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate [...] Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, & through Groves [...] Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance [...] Show to the Sun thir wav'd coats dropt with Gold, [...] Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend [...] Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food [...] In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale, [...] And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk [...] 410 [...] Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate [...] Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan [...] Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep [...] Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes, [...] And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles [...] Draws in, and at his <b>Trunck</b> spouts out a Sea. [...] Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares [...] Thir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon [...] Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclos'd [...] Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge [...] 420 [...] They summ'd thir Penns, and soaring th' air sublime [...] With clang despis'd the ground, under a cloud [...] In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork [...] On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build: [...] Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise [...] In common, rang'd in figure wedge thir way, [...] Intelligent of seasons, and set forth [...] Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea's [...] Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing [...] Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane [...] 430 [...] Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire [...] Floats, as they pass, fann'd with unnumber'd plumes: [...] From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song [...] Solac'd the Woods, and spred thir painted wings [...] Till Ev'n, nor then the solemn Nightingal [...] Ceas'd warbling, but all night tun'd her soft layes: [...] Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath'd [...] Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck [...] Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes [...] Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit [...] 440 [...] The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre [...] The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground [...] Walk'd firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds [...] The silent hours, and th' other whose gay Traine [...] Adorns him, colour'd with the Florid hue [...] Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes. The Waters thus [...] With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle, [...] Ev'ning and Morn solemniz'd the Fift day. [...] The Sixt, and of Creation last arose [...] With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said, [...] 450 [...] Let th' Earth bring forth Fowle living in her kinde, [...] Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth, [...] Each in their kinde. The Earth obey'd, and strait [...] Op'ning her fertil Woomb teem'd at a Birth [...] Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes, [...] Limb'd and full grown: out of the ground up-rose [...] As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns [...] In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den; [...] Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk'd: [...] The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green: [...] 460 [...] Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks [...] Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung: [...] The grassie Clods now Calv'd, now half appeer'd [...] The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free [...] His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds, [...] And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce, [...] The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale [...] Rising, the crumbl'd Earth above them threw [...] In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground [...] Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould [...] 470 [...] Behemoth biggest born of Earth upheav'd [...] His vastness: Fleec't the Flocks and bleating rose, [...] As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land [...] The River Horse and scalie Crocodile. [...] At once came forth whatever creeps the ground, [...] Insect or Worme; those wav'd thir limber fans [...] For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact [...] In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride [...] With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green: [...] These as a line thir long dimension drew, [...] 480 [...] Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all [...] Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde [...] Wondrous in length and corpulence involv'd [...] Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings.

[...] Now Heav'n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld [...] Her motions, as the great first-Movers hand [...] 500 [...] First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire [...] Consummate lovly smil'd; Aire, Water, Earth, [...] By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt [...] Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain'd; [...] There wanted yet the Master work, the end [...] Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone [...] And Brute as other Creatures, but endu'd [...] With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect [...] His Stature, and upright with Front serene [...] Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence [...] 510 [...] Magnanimous to correspond with Heav'n, [...] But grateful to acknowledge whence his good [...] Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes [...] Directed in Devotion, to adore [...] And worship God Supream, who made him chief [...] Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent [...] Eternal Father (For where is not hee [...] Present) thus to his Son audibly spake. [...] Let us make now Man in our image, Man [...] In our similitude, and let them rule [...] 520 [...] Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire, [...] Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth, [...] And every creeping thing that creeps the ground. [...] This said, he formd thee, Adam, thee O Man [...] Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath'd [...] The breath of Life; in his own Image hee [...] Created thee, in the Image of God [...] Express, and thou becam'st a living Soul. [...] Male he created thee, but thy consort [...] Femal for Race; then bless'd Mankinde, and said, [...] 530 [...] Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth, [...] Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold [...] Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire, [...] And every living thing that moves on the Earth. [...] Wherever thus created, for no place [...] Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know'st [...] He brought thee into this delicious Grove, [...] This Garden, planted with the Trees of God, [...] Delectable both to behold and taste; [...] And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food [...] 540 [...] Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th' Earth yeelds, [...] Varietie without end; but of the Tree [...] Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil, [...] Thou mai'st not; in the day thou eat'st, thou di'st; [...] Death is the penaltie impos'd, beware, [...] And govern well thy appetite, least sin [...] Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death. [...] Here finish'd hee, and all that he had made [...] View'd, and behold all was entirely good; [...] So Ev'n and Morn accomplish'd the Sixt day: [...] 550 [...] Yet not till the Creator from his work [...] Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd [...] Up to the Heav'n of Heav'ns his high abode, [...] Thence to behold this new created World [...] Th' addition of his Empire, how it shew'd [...] In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire, [...] Answering his great Idea.

40|$|In {{present study}} the {{temporal}} dimension of amodal completion in visual occlusion was investigated. We supposed that the visual system prefers to complete normally (vertically-horizontally) oriented contours than the oblique ones. Using the prime-matching paradigm we investigated {{the strength of}} amodal primes effects on processing speed of relating test figures. Both, prime and test stimuli were presented in normal and oblique (45 o) orientations. The primes were pairs of identical figures: CC (<b>truncked</b> squares), SS (hexagons) and AA (amodal patterns: circle occludes either amodal C or amodal S). Temporal distribution of stimuli: prime 400 ms, ISIs 20 ms and test figures until response. Test figures were the “same” pairs, CC and SS, and the “different” pairs, SC and CS. Each “same” test figures had its identical prime (CC => CC or SS => SS) and its amodal prime (AA => CC and AA => SS). The {{subjects were asked to}} answer whether the figures in test stimuli were same or different. The “same” RTs were analysed. The effect of amodal prime was systematically weaker (longer RT) than the effect of identical primes. Orientation was not significant factor. The significant partial interaction prime x orientation was obtained for C test figures: the effect of amodal prime was closer to effect of identical prime when the contour was normally oriented. In the case of S test figures the interaction was not obtained. We concluded that the more symmetric test figure (S) was resistant to the prime effect...|$|R

40|$|International audienceInspired by a {{question}} of Yannakakis on the Vertex Packing polytope of perfect graphs, we study the Clique-Stable Set separation in a non-hereditary subclass of perfect graphs. A cut (B, W) of G (a bipartition of V (G)) separates a clique K and a stable set S if $K ⊆ B$ and $S ⊆ W$. A Clique-Stable Set separator is a family of cuts such that for every clique K, and for every stable set S disjoint from K, there exists {{a cut in the}} family that separates K and S. Given a class of graphs, the question is to know whether every graph of the class admits a Clique-Stable Set separator containing only polynomially many cuts. It was recently proved to be false for the class of all graphs (Göös 2015), but it remains open for perfect graphs, which was Yannakakis' original question. Here we investigate this problem on perfect graphs with no balanced skew-partition; the balanced skew-partition was introduced in the decomposition theorem of Berge graphs which led to the celebrated proof of the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem. Recently, Chudnovsky, Trotignon, <b>Trunck</b> and Vuškovi´Vuškovi´c proved that forbidding this unfriendly decomposition permits to recursively decompose Berge graphs (more precisely, Berge trigraphs) using 2 -join and complement 2 -join until reaching a " basic " graph, and in this way, they found an efficient combinatorial algorithm to color those graphs.

We then generalize this result and prove that the Strong Erd˝ os-Hajnal property holds in this class, which means that every such graph has a linear-size biclique or complement biclique. This is remarkable since the property does not hold for all perfect graphs (Fox 2006), and this is motivated here by the following statement: when the Strong Erdös-Hajnal property holds in a hereditary class of graphs, then both the Erdöos-Hajnal property and the polynomial Clique-Stable Set separation hold.

40|$|The English resumé {{is given}} in a {{different}} form from the Portuguese "conclusões". In the former we gave mainly the results which may be of general interest, explaining the tables (quadros) and the procedure of statistical analysis, while in the other {{the properties of the}} different rootstocks are discussed in detail since they are of immediate local interest. 1. In a previous publication, Moreira (19) explained the layout and the first results of an experiment, under way since 1936 in the Limeira Exp. Sta., on the influence of twelve different types of Citrus rootstocks on three scion varieties : the oranges "Baianinha" and "Pera" and the grape-fruit "Marsh Seedless". We report here three main results obtained during the first six years of the experiment: a) all plants budded on sour and bitter-sweet oranges (C. aurantium), showed definite signs of the new disease "tristeza"; b) other rootstocks such as citron (C. medica), ponderosa lemon (C. lemon) had such disadvantageous effect that they could be eliminated as suitable stocks; c) the data of the first four crops permit to determine certain particularities of some rootstocks varieties used in the experiment. The present paper deals with the complete analysis of the data obtained during the years 1939 - 1942. This work offered various interesting problems {{from the point of view}} of statistical method. The results are of scientific interest, showing very strong interactions between rootstocks and scion in Citrus, besides being of immediate practical importance. The widespread effect of the new disease "tristeza" caused on the Citrus culture in the State of São' Paulo where nearly all sweet oranges, both for local consumption and for export, were budded on sour orange rootstocks, requires immediate action and recommendations for the substitution by other suitable rootstocks. 2. The material used consisted of twelve rootstocks and three scion varieties in all their possible 36 combinations. Scion varieties : "Baianinha" and "Pera" orange, Marsh Seedless grape-fruit. Rootstocks : sour and bitter sweet oranges, "laranja caipira" (sweet orange), "laranja lima" (sweet orange), rangpur lime, sweet lime, rough lemon, ponderosa lemon, citron, grapefruit, "cravo" tangerine and trifoliate orange. 3. The experimental layout for each scion consisted of two conjugated randomized "quadras" or super-blocks, each with six rootstocks and four replications. In one super-block the more important rootstocks were united (quadra A) and in the other less important ones (quadra B). In "quadra" A each individual plot contained 9 trees and in "quadra" B, 4 trees only. Thus we have for the analysis of variance the following decomposition of degrees of freedom : Super- Super- Confounding block A block B A and B Between Superblocks (quadras) [...] 1 Between Rootstocks [...] . 5 5 10 Between Replications [...] . 3 3 6 Interaction [...] 15 15 30 Residual (between trees of each plot) [...] 192 72 346 At first the analysis was carried out separately for the super-blocks but since a sufficient degree of uniformity was found, especially with regards to the residual error, "quadras" A and B were confounded. The degree cf freedom for the residual error totalises always slightly less than 364, owing to the death of several trees which thus were eliminated. 4. The following measurements were subjected to the analysis : Circumference of the rootstocks, 20 cm from the ground. Circumference of the zone of union, 30 cm from the ground. Circumference of the scion, 40 cm from the ground. Maximum circumference of the tree. Height of the tree. Number and diameter of fruits. 5. At first a homogeneity test was carried out on a number of seedling trees of each roctstock in order to determine whether they were reasonably homogenous (quadro II). Only a few of the trees were found to be slightly more or less variable than the remainder, with 10 values of standard errors between the 5 % and 1 % limit of probability. Thus trifoliata orange was slightly less and ponderosa lemon slightly more variable than the other 10 rootstocks. The homogeneity test for the 36 combinations {{is given in}} "quadro" IV and as a whole showed satisfactory results. Ponderosa lemon and grapefruit gave an increase in variability for the circumference of the rootstocks, in all the combinations. Citron with grapefruit scion gave a very significant increase of variability, and the combination trifoliata-' 'Baianinha" was less variable than the remainder. In the comparison we did not use only the standard error, but also the variance index (Brieger, 4) since the means were of different magnitude. 6. The results of the analysis of variance are given in detail in "quadro" V and are summarised in "quadro" VI. The latter shows that there is a significant increase of variability between replications, indicating a certain degree of heterogenity in the soil. The variability was however only twice that of the residual error between individual trees. There was no interaction and all combinations behaved uniformily in all replications. The difference between combinations of roctstocks and scions were very considerable and caused an increase of variability of 10 times (7 to 13 times) the residual variation. The difference between superblocks was still bigger and amounted to more than 20 times the residual variability. Since the datas analysed included one measurement of the rootstocks and several ones of the scion, there cannot be any doubt about the existence of a very pronounced physiological interaction between the two components. 7. Thus our next object was to stydy the nature and direction of this interaction and to decide which were the combinations most favorable from a practical point of view. Most of these were carried out using the data of 1942. a) The means were calculated and organized in the order of magnitude. Then consecutive differences were calculated and the correspondent value of t computed. Consequently only positive values of t could appear, and a new table of Brieger (5), for unilateral limits, had to be used. The results are given in the respective columns of "quadros" VII to IX. The values of t do not form a uniform and homogeneous series, but there are always jumps, indicated by large and significant values of t. Comparing different measurements for the same combination of rootstocks and scion, a certain uniform twend can be found, and as itisseen in the tables certain rootstocks had a pronounced tendency to be more favorable than others, in 1942. b) Next an order test was carried out, to compare means of the former years, and the results given in "quadros" X to XII. This test has been developed by Brieger (6) in order to permit a statistical analysis in cases where the rank correlation coefficient cannot be applied. The means are arranged in series according to their magnitude and numbers of order or rank are given to them, both in the series of increasing values (direct order) and of dedreasing values (inverted order). Then the probability is calculated of obtaining such numbers of order as observed or lower numbers still. The values thus calculated are given for the direct order in the column called "maiores" and for the inverse order in the column called "menores". A value of P = 0, 1 indicates in the direct order that only once in 1000 there may be obtained a series of means as big or still bigger as the values actually observed, and in the inverse order a value for a mean as small or still smaller. 8. Accepting a 1 % limit of probability in our case of comparison between the means in four years, we get the following results. "Baianinha". Tendency for bigger production (number of fruits) is found with sweet lime, rangpur lime and rough lemon. The circumference of the rootstock is bigger with rough lemon, sweet orange (caipira) and sweet lime, and that of the scion is bigger with rough lemon, sweet orange (caipira) and rangpur lime. "Pera". The most productive combinations are with rangpur lime, rough lemon, sweet lime and also ponderosa lemon. The biggest rootstocks are found with rough lemon and sweet orange (caipira), and the biggest scions with rough lemon, rangpur and sweet limes. "Marsh Seedless" grapefruit is most productive with rangpur lime, rough lemon and sweet lime. The biggest rootstocks with rough lemon and sweet orange (caipira); the biggest scion with rough lemon, sweet orange (caipira) and sweet lime. 9. Next several special characters were studied which seemed to be important. a) In order to determine whether the union between rootstocks and scion was perfect or whether there was incompatibility between the two, the following t-test was carried out (quadro XXIII) : between the circumference of the rootstocks (20 cm from the ground) and the point of union (30 cm), and between the latter and the circumference of the trunk of the scion (40 cm). In the case of pronounced incompatibility the point of union should be bigger than either of the two other values. In the case of compatibility three forms of the trunk may be observed : it may be either conical and in this case both values should be positive and significant; or it may be cylindrical with both values of t insignificant; or, finally; the rootstocks may be cylindrical and the scion conical, with the first value of t insignificant and the other positive and significant. All combinations on citron as rootstocks showed a very pronounced incompatibility-All cases where sour and bitter-sweet oranges were used, showed abnormal behaviour possible due to the effect of the disease "tristeza". All the other rootstocks-scion combination were compatible and gave conical trunks when combined with "Baianinha", while in the case of "Pera" and "Marsh Seedless" the rootstocks were more frequently cylindrical and the scion conical. b) A detailed study mas carried out with regards to the effect of the rootstocks on the form of the trees (quadros XIV-XVI). Since the t-test did not give sufficiently clear results, an index was calculated by dividing the height of the tree by its diameter. This index should be equal to one in round trees, b'gger than one in cylindrical trees and smaller than one in flat topped trees. "Quadro" XV shows clearly that the rootstocks exerted a strong effect on the form of the trees. A complete analysis was carried out for the three more important rootstocks (quadro XVI) : sweet orange (caipira), rough lemon and sweet lime [...] The test within - between proved that the effect of the rootstocks on the tree form are significant. Comparing the means, one can conclude that "caipira" which has a cylindrical form itself (index : 1, 87), turns the tops of the scions more cylindrical. Rough lemon which is more nearly round (index: 1, 12) has practically no effect on the two oranges scion and flattens the top of the grapefruit tree. Sweet lime with an index of 1, 20 reduces somewhat the height of the oranges scion and turns the grapefruit slightly more cylindrical. c) A study of linear correlations was carried out in order to determine whether we may facilitate our work by estimating the relative height and form of trees by measuring only the circumference of the <b>trunck</b> of the scion. The respective values, given in "quadro" XVII show a rather complex result, in consequence of the different nature of the physiological interactions. There is a very pronounced variability of individual values as shown by the X²test. Height and c:rcumference of tree tops and, as whole, circumference of the <b>trunck</b> are pratically not correlated. There is some correlation between the latter and the circumference of the tree top. 10. A full description of the effects of the different rootstocks, given in the portuguese test and the conclusions will not be translated. We shall limit us to only our sugestions as to which of the rootstocks may be considered as the most favorable for the varieties studied : For the "BAIANINHA" orange : sweet orange (caipira), rough lemon and sweet orange (laranja lima). For the "PERA" orange : sweet lime, rangpur lime, and the sweet oranges "lima" and "caipira". For the "MARSH SEEDLESS" grapefruit: rough lemon, sweet oranges "caipira" and "lima"...|$|E
