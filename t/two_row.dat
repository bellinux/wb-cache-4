5|$|Jeremiah Fisher {{constructed}} <b>two</b> <b>row</b> houses, {{joined by}} a common wall and constructed of brick laid in a Flemish bond, near the city square in 1817. These houses lay on Second Street and face west onto Constitution Square. Fisher owned and rented these houses until 1850, but after he sold them they were used as tenements until at least the 1940s. The Wilderness Trace Art League and Boyle County Historical Society Museum occupied the row houses, before the park's purchase by the county. It now houses the Danville-Boyle County Chamber of Commerce, the Arts Commission of Danville-Boyle County, and the communications department of the Danville Boyle-County Economic Development Partnership.|$|E

25|$|Two-family {{houses were}} village residences either {{originally}} built or later modified to house an owner and tenant. They are generally {{similar to that}} form, except for some turn-of-the-century designs where architects {{took advantage of the}} larger size to scale the form up. Some were divided vertically to look like <b>two</b> <b>row</b> houses. They are usually two stories in height, taking up most of the larger lots they occupy, leaving little room for yards.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} of these factors meant McManaman suffered a loss of form, but, McManaman managed to rally and pick up his play {{right at the end}} of that last campaign. McManaman scored a crucial goal away at Blackburn Rovers, set up a dramatic injury time equaliser with a through-ball for Paul Ince to score in front of the Kop against Manchester United, and scored the winner from outside the area with a half volley to complete the full turn around result against Tottenham Hotspur after trailing 2–0 at half-time. In what was the final match of the season, and what would be McManaman's final match and final contribution on the pitch for the club, McManaman assisted Karl-Heinz Riedle with a goal at the Kop with a trademark right wing run and pull back as Liverpool won 3–0 against Wimbledon, enabling McManaman to end his career at the club to a standing ovation, a lap of honour at Anfield, and a <b>two</b> <b>row</b> squad farewell at the entrance of the players' tunnel.|$|E
2500|$|The L'Oiseau Canari II {{was later}} re-engined with a 670kW (900hp) <b>two</b> <b>row</b> radial Gnome-Rhône 14Kfs engine, perhaps because Hispano-Suiza {{reclaimed}} their loaned engined.

40|$|A pseudo 2 -D {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} developed to simulate a cupola with one <b>row</b> and <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of tuyere. The simulation results predicted higher spout temperature and combustion ratio for cupola with <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of tuyere compared to that with one row. Further, the model {{has been used to}} study the effect of the distance of separation between the <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of tuyere on cupola performance. The computed results shows that the spout temperature increases with tuyere level separation and attains the maximum at an optimum distance of separation between <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of tuyere. Above the optimum, the spout temperature starts decreasing. The exit gas temperature and combustion ratio increases monotonously with the increase in tuyere level separation. These results agree well with the reported experimental observations. The mechanism behind the improved cupola performance with <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of tuyere has been deduced from the computed temperature and composition profiles inside the cupola...|$|R
2500|$|David was {{powered by}} a [...] Le Rhône 9Z rotary engine, neatly {{enclosed}} within an aluminium cowling and driving a two blade propeller. [...] It underwent official testing early in 1920 at Villacoublay. [...] Sports fitted with extended upper wings gained first and second prizes at a speed range competition that year. [...] The production version, first displayed in September 1921 in Brussels, gained its certificate that December. [...] It was {{powered by a}}n [...] Anzani 6Bbis <b>two</b> <b>row</b> radial. This engine was fitted with its cylinder heads exposed for cooling.|$|E
2500|$|The C.68 was {{powered by}} a [...] Anzani 6-cylinder <b>two</b> <b>row</b> radial engine, mounted without a cowling and driving a two blade propeller. Behind the engine the {{fuselage}} was flat sided, though the underside had a curved profile and there was curved upper decking. It had two open cockpits, one under the wing and the second just aft of the trailing edge. The C.68's fin was triangular and broad, carrying a vertical edged unbalanced rudder which extended down to the keel. Its tailplane was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage with its elevators notched to allow rudder movement. It had a tailskid undercarriage with its mainwheels on a single [...] long axle sprung on two V-form struts from the lower fuselage longerons.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structural}} fuselage of the Types M and N was {{a rectangular}} section, ash framed lattice girder with wire cross bracing. Poplar formers and stringers produced a more rounded, fabric covered section. The pilot sat well {{down in an}} open cockpit over the wing and behind the upper pylon. A wide range of engines were fitted, including the [...] Anzani three cylinder inverted Y radial engine, the [...] Anzani 6-cylinder <b>two</b> <b>row</b> radial and the [...] Gnome. The last, a rotary engine, was usually covered over the upper part to screen the pilot from oil spray; the Anzanis were mounted uncowled. They all drove large, rather broad chord propellers. [...] The very broad chord, low aspect ratio tailplane was constructed like the wing with a flexible rear surface acting both to improve stability and, by warping, act like conventional elevators, its trailing edge extending well beyond {{the end of the}} fuselage. [...] A small, near rectangular, one piece, rigid fin was pivoted near its leading edge from the extreme tail.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the competition indices of intercropping wheat and chickpea under nitrogen consumption, an experiment was arranged as factorial based on Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications during 2009 – 2010 in Gonbad Kavous University farm. Planting patterns factor included four levels of sole cropping Wheat (W), <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of wheat with one row of Chickpea (W 2 C 1) one row of wheat with <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of Chickpea (W 1 C 2) and sole cropping Chickpea (C) and nitrogen consumption contained four levels of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 kg N/h per/ha. Results showed that the highest grain yield and wheat equivalent yield was obtained from sole cropping of wheat. In the intercropping of <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of wheat with one row of chickpea and one row of wheat with <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of chickpea Land Equivalent Ratio was 0. 87 and 0. 71 respectively that was less than sole cropping of wheat and cicer. Relative Crowding Coefficient of wheat in <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of wheat with one row of chickpea and one row of wheat with <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of chickpea was 1. 93 and 1. 73 and of chickpea was 0. 15 and 0. 17 respectively. The Aggressivity parameter indicated a tendency for wheat to dominate cicer in both intercropping. Competitive Ratio in <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of wheat with one row of chickpea was greater than one row of wheat with <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of chickpea. Actual Yield Loss and Intercropping Advantage in wheat was positive and in cicer was negative. Actual Yield Loss and Intercropping Advantage in Intercropping of wheat and cicer was decreased...|$|R

6000|$|General Knox was {{associated}} with General Greene in this visit of inspection. They examined {{the river and the}} passes of the Highlands in company with Generals McDougall, George Clinton, and Anthony Wayne. The latter, recently promoted to the rank of brigadier, had just returned from Ticonderoga. The five generals made a joint report to Washington, in which they recommended the completion of the obstructions in the river already commenced. These consisted of a boom, or heavy iron chain, across the river from Fort Montgomery to Anthony's Nose, with cables stretched in front to break the force of any ship under way, before she could strike it. The boom was to be protected by the guns of two ships and <b>two</b> <b>row</b> galleys stationed just above it, and by batteries on shore. This, it was deemed, would be sufficient to prevent the enemy's ships from ascending the river. If these obstructions could be rendered effective, they did not think the enemy would attempt to operate by land; [...] "the passes through the Highlands being so exceedingly difficult." ...|$|E

50|$|Because of the {{cylinder}} arrangement in the VR6 - with <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of combustion chambers {{within the same}} cylinder head, the intake and exhaust ports between the <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of cylinders are of varying lengths.
