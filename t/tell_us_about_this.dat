40|$|The {{presented}} {{work offers}} {{an introduction to}} the theory of regular tree graphs and the associated Schrödinger Operators. We will start with a brief introduction, which recalls the required facts about Sturm-Liouville Operators and what the spectral theorem <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> operators. If you are not so comfortable with this terms, you should {{take a closer look at}} [12], which presents an more detailed introduction to these terms. The second chapter generalizes a result from Barry Simon [9] on the con-nection between the absolutely continuous spectrum and boundedness of eigen-functions to arbitrary Sturm-Liouville operators. In the third chapter, we will investigate regular trees and Laplace operators on these trees. We introduce special subspaces, which reduce the Laplacian. Then, we will say how we can describe the spectrum with the help of these reducing subspaces. Finally, we will characterize the trees in relation to spectral characteristics with the help of the result derived in Chapter 2. In the last chapter, we will show how the results of the previous chapters can be used to investigate the spectra of regular trees with constant branching number and constant edge length. Thanks I wish to thank my advisor Gerald Teschl for his support and his patience, when writing this. ...|$|R
40|$|After the calamitous {{events of}} 2007 – 8, US {{regulators}} {{appear to have}} taken for granted that central banks׳ “lifeboats” of insolvent financial institutions are necessarily a bad thing. This paper argues that such an assumption might be wrong. According to the authors, {{it is possible to}} single out at least one historical episode – the 1889 bailout of Comptoir d׳Escompte (CdE) by Banque de France (BdF) – showing that “good” lifeboats may exist. In their view, this bailout was a success because it allowed for an orderly management of the troubles of a systemically important financial institution (SIFI) while providing the right incentives to prevent the rise of moral hazard. The authors must be praised for bringing back to our attention this very interesting episode, which is perfectly representative of the difficulties and ambiguities inherent to the evaluation of lifeboats.

But the particular forms they so often take – a dysfunctional mother-daughter dynamic, leading to the search for maternal surrogates; and the figure of the prematurely deceased father – are more perplexing. Why do families adhere to these patterns in so many South Asian American texts and what does that <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> œuvre? More precisely, why are mothers subjected to a harsher critique than fathers and what purpose does this critique serve? How might we interpret the trope of the untimely paternal death?

40|$|Plyometrics {{is treated}} {{as a method of}} power {{development}} and a suitable form of training for many team and individual sports. In order to implement this type of training among young athletes several factors must be considered. Firstly, we have to examine what controlled research studies have to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> form of training and its effect on young children. Secondly, is it safe to use plyometric exercise with young children. Currently, there are few peer- reviewed researches in the available literature that can explain the effects of this form of training.

The conclusion that has been drawn from this study and in comparison with the examined studies is that plyometrics could be not only effective but also a safe method.

Manuscript collections created by the individuals and institutions who were responsible for the scientific revolution offer valuable evidence of the intellectual aspirations and working practices of the principal protagonists. This volume is the first to explore such archives, focusing on the ways in which ideas were formulated, stored and disseminated, and opening up understanding of the process of intellectual change. It analyses the characteristics and history of the archives of such leading intellectuals as Robert Boyle, Galileo Galilei, G. W. Leibniz, Isaac Newton and William Petty; also considered are the new scientific institutions founded at the time, the Royal Society and the Académie des Sciences. In each case, significant broader findings emerge concerning the nature and role of such holdings; an introductory essay discusses the interpretation and exploitation of archives...|$|E

40|$|Ancient Greek {{philosophers}} {{stressed the}} importance of asceticism, in order to increase wisdom, sometimes reaching the point of starvation. Neglecting one’s own body by strict ascetic practices, which included a very poor and limited diet, led to a higher status at the philosophical level and was a way to ideal perfection. Food or rather the refusal of it {{played a crucial role in}} their philosophy. Ancient biographers <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> struggle against material needs, whereas at the same time some comic texts bear witness to the contrast with ordinary people’s way of eating. When Christianity took over ancient civilization and became the dominant ideology, the ideal of perfection focused on salvation and union with God. In order to attain this divine union, which recalled the original perfection before sin, all passions should be controlled, especially sex and food. Depriving the body from almost any nourishment was the safest way to attain a full development of the soul and a perfect knowledge of God. In the West, the ideal of perfection has changed throughout history up to the present, from ancient philosophy to spiritual salvation, purity or even aesthetic excellence, all of which are subjective concepts of perfection to be attained by individuals through despising material food, sometime to the point of starvation...|$|E
40|$|Considering the {{increasing}} number of elderly in the world’s population today, developing effective treatments for age-related pathologies {{is one of the biggest}} challenges in modern medical research. Age-related neurodegeneration, in particular, significantly impacts important sensory, motor, and cognitive functions, seriously constraining life quality of many patients. Although our understanding of the causal mechanisms of aging has greatly improved in recent years, animal model systems still have much to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> complex process. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have gained enormous popularity for this research topic over the past decade, since their life span is relatively short but, like humans, they are still subject to gradual aging. In addition, the extensive characterization of its well-conserved molecular and cellular physiology makes the zebrafish an excellent model to unravel the underlying mechanisms of aging, disease, and repair. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the progress made in zebrafish gerontology, with special emphasis on nervous system aging. We review the evidence that classic hallmarks of aging can also be recognized within this small vertebrate, both at the molecular and cellular level. Moreover, we illustrate the high level of similarity with age-associated human pathologies through a survey of the functional deficits that arise as zebrafish age. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 133 - 154) The {{scholarship of}} the last century has not examined the Middle English romances for how they might reveal the desires and anxieties about love, marriage, and the family of the mercantile society that was their audience. This thesis explores the representations of love in three late thirteenth-century to late fourteenth-century romances, Havelok the Dane, Lay Le Freine, and Geoffrey Chaucer's the Merchant's Tale, to find what they <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> mercantile audience. Mercantile love in these texts differs from courtly love, where a knight's love for a lady (generally not his wife) inspires him to great deeds in combat. The representations in the texts also differ from ecclesiastical love, which concerns itself with love for God and aspirations to be Christ-like. Mercantile love is "uncourtly" and tries to balance the erotic and spiritual aspects of love within marriage, the family, and the community. The mercantile ideology that emerges shows merchants as detached from the land, the production of the goods they sell, the church, and the body politic, yet longing for a genteel place in society. In looking at the texts {{over the course of a}} century, one sees the schism become more pronounced and more unresolved...|$|E
