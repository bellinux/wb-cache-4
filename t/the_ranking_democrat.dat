5|$|By {{the time}} of his 1922 {{re-election}} bid, Barkley was <b>the</b> <b>ranking</b> <b>Democrat</b> on the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. In the election, he carried every First District county, including the Republican strongholds of Caldwell and Crittenden counties. Despite the victory he lacked the political organization needed for higher office. According to Barkley biographer James K. Libbey, the establishment of such an organization, and not necessarily a desire to become governor, may have motivated him to announce his candidacy for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination on November 11, 1922. Critics charged that this was his intent, and he did little to deny it.|$|E

500|$|From February to May 1996, the House National Security Committee held {{hearings}} on the ballistic missile threat, and in a final report recommended that two reviews be created: one to investigate the NIE itself, and another to complete a new investigation of the ballistic missile threat.

[...] Many of the witnesses called before the committee were in fact strong proponents of missile defense. [...] The first review was conducted by former Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and future Defense Secretary Robert Gates. [...] He concluded that while there was evidence of faulty methodology in the NIE, there was no political bias in its conclusions.

[...] I couldn't help admiring his clear and incisive way of putting a question, although it appeared to me that his manner is occasionally very irritating. [...] This manner of his is very much that of a lawyer employed as counsel in a case, who therefore makes ex parte statements, and thinks it fair to make all manner of allegations."
