5|$|Hammond-Suzuki {{continues}} to manufacture {{a variety of}} organs for both professional players and churches. Other companies, such as Korg, Roland, and Clavia, have also achieved success in providing more lightweight and portable emulations of the original tonewheel organs. <b>The</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tonewheel Hammond can also be emulated using modern software such as Native Instruments B4.|$|E
5|$|Hullabaloo, Caneck! Caneck!: Beginning {{phrase of}} the Aggie War Hymn. The lyrics are an onomatopoeic {{representation}} of the sound a cannon being loaded, or also <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> train rolling through town since there is a train track that splits the campus.|$|E
5|$|Special unpitched stops {{also appear}} in some organs. Among {{these are the}} Zimbelstern (a wheel of {{rotating}} bells), the nightingale (a pipe submerged in a small pool of water, creating <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bird warbling when wind is admitted), and the effet d'orage ("thunder effect", a device that sounds the lowest bass pipes simultaneously). Standard orchestral percussion instruments such as the drum, chimes, celesta, and harp have also been imitated in organ building.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} morning, Rasminah is {{awakened by}} <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> guitar, {{played by the}} house's owner, Hoesin (Djoemala). Afraid that he is collaborating with her pursuer, she sneaks outside, only to be confronted by Parta and Doel. Retreating, she is chased by the pair. Hoesin intervenes and, after a fierce fight, defeats the two and chases them away. He then reassures Rasminah and escorts her home.|$|E
5|$|The guitar {{opening on}} {{the song was}} {{produced}} {{as a result of}} combining <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Martin guitar and a vintage Dobro resonating guitar. Ray Davies cited this blend of guitar sounds for the song's unique guitar sound.|$|E
5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden {{building was}} constructed each year, called Dover Castle, from which gunfire salutes were sounded during the competitions. Competitors were {{summoned to the}} hillside by <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hunting horn, {{to take part in}} various sports. Mounted cannons were fired to begin the events, which included horse-racing, coursing with hounds, running, jumping, dancing, sledgehammer throwing, fighting with swords and cudgels, quarterstaff, and wrestling. Prizes included silver trophies for the mounted sports, and perhaps also money for the other events.|$|E

5|$|A year later, David Cone, {{one of the}} {{key players}} in the then-most recent Yankee dynasty, started for the Red Sox against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium to <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{standing}} ovation despite playing for the arch-rival Red Sox. It marked Cone's first return to Yankee Stadium since leaving the team. Cone would later take part in another notable game later that year when he went up against newly acquired Yankee pitcher Mike Mussina. Mussina had come within one strike of pitching a perfect game against the Red Sox at Fenway Park. Carl Everett's 9th-inning two-out, two-strike single was the only baserunner allowed by Mussina in a 1–0 Yankee win. Coincidentally, David Cone was the last Yankee pitcher to throw a perfect game, in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Alex Cox {{had tried}} to make a Mars Attacks film in the 1980s before Burton and Gems began {{development}} in 1993. When Gems turned in his first draft in 1994, Warner Bros. commissioned rewrites from Gems, Burton, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski in an attempt to lower the budget to $60 million. The final production budget came to $80 million, while Warner Bros. spent another $20 million on the Mars Attacks! marketing campaign. Filming took place from February to November 1996. The film was shot in California, Nevada, Kansas, Arizona and Argentina. The soundtrack became famous for the Martians' quirky speech pattern, which was created by reversing <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> duck's quack.|$|E
5|$|An edited {{version of}} the musical cue from the Tar Sequence (where the inmates are energetically paving the road) {{has been used for}} years as the theme music for local {{television}} stations' news programs around the world, mostly those owned and operated by ABC in the United States. Although the music was written for the film, it became more familiar for its association with television news, in part because its staccato melody resembles <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> telegraph.|$|E

5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's sound is that the {{individual}} notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they had nothing against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the bottom notes are actually performed on a double bass. According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one note of the string sounds contains <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chair being scraped in the background.|$|E
5|$|As {{the elder}} sibling, Durga cares for Apu with motherly affection, but spares no {{opportunity}} to tease him. Together, they share the simple joys of life: sitting quietly under a tree, viewing pictures in a travelling vendor's bioscope, running after the candy man who passes through the village, and watching a jatra (folk theatre) performed by a troupe of actors. Every evening they are delighted by <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> distant train's whistle. One day, they {{run away from home}} {{to catch a glimpse of}} the train, only to discover Indir lying dead on their return.|$|E
5|$|Cooper is woken early by <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> raucous {{party in}} the Great Northern Hotel. He leaves to meet Truman, while Jerry Horne (David Patrick Kelly) meets his brother Benjamin (Richard Beymer) to discuss the new Icelandic investors in their {{property}} developments. Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) arrives, disoriented and wishing to return to work, but the Hornes send him home. Cooper, Truman and Doctor Hayward (Warren Frost) discuss Johnson's bloodied shirt, learning that the blood is not Laura's but that of drug smuggler Jacques Renault.|$|E

5|$|Debuting in the Japanese manga {{magazine}} Bessatsu Hana to Yume in December 1991, the manga {{was eventually}} transferred to Hana to Yume, where it ran until 1994; the {{chapters of the}} sequel, Godchild, appeared between the May 2001 issue and the October 2003 issue in Hana to Yume. Together, the series spans 13 tankōbon volumes, with five for Forgotten Juliet, <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Boy Hatching, Kafka, and The Seal of the Red Ram and eight for Godchild. Two drama CDs based on the series were also released. Set in 19th-century England, the series focuses on a young earl named Cain Hargreaves who solves murders while encountering his father's secret organization, Delilah, that experiments with reviving the dead.|$|E
5|$|Earl Cain is {{licensed}} for English-language {{release in}} North America by Viz Media, which published Forgotten Juliet, <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Boy Hatching, Kafka, and The Seal of the Red Ram as The Cain Saga. The {{first volume of}} The Cain Saga was published in October 2006; the final volume was published in June 2007. Godchild was released simultaneously, {{as well as being}} serialized in Viz's manga anthology Shojo Beat from July 2005 to June 2006.|$|E
5|$|George Holdcroft {{composed}} the score for The FP. He {{was invited to}} a screening of the film by producer Christian Agypt, {{and asked if he}} could compose the music for it. Holdcroft, who lived in Chicago at the time, spent 12 hours a day composing the score and e-mailed his compositions to the Trost brothers. To emulate <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> choir for one song, Holdcroft sang the same segment more than 200 times using different voices and melodies to achieve the desired result. For another song, he sang in falsetto and altered the pitch of his voice to make himself sound like a woman.|$|E

5|$|In 1755, Benedict Arnold was {{attracted}} by <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> drummer {{and attempted to}} enlist in the provincial militia for service against the French, but his mother refused permission. In 1757 when he was sixteen, he did enlist in the Connecticut militia, which marched off toward Albany and Lake George. The French had besieged Fort William Henry in northeastern New York, and their Indian allies had committed atrocities after their victory. Word of the siege's disastrous outcome led the company to turn around; Arnold served for 13 days. A commonly accepted story that Arnold deserted from militia service in 1758 is based on uncertain documentary evidence.|$|E
5|$|Manne {{had strong}} {{preferences}} in {{his choice of}} drum set. Those preferences, however, changed several times over his career. He began with Gretsch drums. In 1957, intrigued by <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> kind of drum made by Leedy (then owned by Slingerland), he had a line made for him that also became popular with other drummers. In the 1970s, after trying and abandoning many others for reasons of sound or maintainability, he settled on the Japanese-made Pearl Drums.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{hours after}} this all-night session, the band {{returned}} to Abbey Road {{to carry out}} overdubs. Harrison added a second vocal and another acoustic guitar part, the latter consisting of riffs that recall <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sitar, due to the strings buzzing against the frets. During the same session, McCartney overdubbed bass guitar onto the track. The recording was finished on 9 October, {{with the addition of}} a brief harmony vocal from McCartney and piano, over the middle eight, played by Chris Thomas.|$|E
