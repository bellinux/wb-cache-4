50|$|Brooke {{designed}} {{a series of}} smoothbores that were produced in small numbers by the Selma and Tredegar foundries. Selma re-bored five flawed 6.4-inch blanks as 8-inch double-banded guns, one of which survives in Selma, Alabama. Brooke's 1863 report to Secretary Mallory shows a plate of an unbanded 8-inch smoothbore, but nothing further is known of it. Similar attempts <b>to</b> <b>bore</b> <b>out</b> flawed 7-inch gun blocks to 9 in smoothbores were unsuccessful. Seven 10 in double-banded guns were cast by Selma and four by Tredegar in 1864. Two survive, {{one of which is}} a trophy from CSS Columbia in the Washington Navy Yard. Selma cast twelve 11-inch double-banded smoothbores in 1864, although only eight were shipped. One survives in Columbus, Georgia. In 1863 and 1864 two 11-inch triple-banded guns were cast by Tredegar, but none are known to survive.|$|E

5000|$|The weapons, {{known as}} [...] "Hall's Carbines", were {{purchased}} by arms dealer Arthur M. Eastman {{in a deal}} negotiated with James Wolfe Ripley, Brigadier General {{and head of the}} US Ordnance Bureau, during June 1861. Subsequently, Eastman agreed to sell the weapons to Simon Stevens for $12.50 each, if Stevens would provide financing in the amount of $20,000 to allow Eastman to complete the purchase from the government. Stevens quickly negotiated a sale to field general John C. Frémont for $22, promising <b>to</b> <b>bore</b> <b>out</b> the rifles to fifty-eight caliber. With the deal completed, Stevens obtained a loan of $20,000 from Morgan. The weapons were delivered to Eastman in August 1861, refurbished during August at a cost of approximately 75 cents each, and 2500 arms were delivered to Fremont by the end of August. Meanwhile, Stevens obtained a loan of $46,226.31 from another banker, Morris Ketchum, of which $37,500 were used to repay Eastman. Morgan was still owed $20,000, and was still holding 2500 rifles as collateral. On Sept. 14, 1861, the US government paid for the first shipment, and Morgan released the remaining rifles for shipment to Fremont. A voucher in lieu of payment for the remaining funds due was sent to Morgan, who forwarded it to Ketchum.|$|E

40|$|M. Sc. (Geology) The {{purpose of}} this work was to attempt to {{understand}} the behaviour of the ground around a series of holes bored in gold bearing rock by a reef boring machine. Furthermore this ground behaviour is compared with existing theoretical concepts of rock behaviour. The experimental boring site and {{the sequence of events}} at that site are described. The state of the rock surrounding the excavations is observed to deteriorate with increase in mining. The fracturing observed is characterised by spalling {{on the sides of the}} bored holes. This spalling increases in severity with closeness <b>to</b> the <b>bored</b> <b>out</b> region. Calculations of the stress acting on the sides of the bored holes were made from elastic theory using two techniques. One of these was a quick graphical technique and the other was a more complex analytical one. The analytical technique was used as a check on the results of the graphical technique. Finally the extent of spalling on the sides of the holes is compared with the theoretical stresses. A close correlation is found, and spalling appears to start when the stress level reaches the strength of the rock. As the stress level increases spalling increases in severity until such time as the ground around the bored area is fractured by large through going fractures. At this stage holes bored in this ground no longer spall...|$|R

2500|$|Nineteen fifty-three saw the {{introduction}} of a new 175cc overhead cam model. MV Agusta produced the 175 CST and CSTL (Turismo Lusso) for street use and soon developed a sportier 175cc version with larger carburetor, a larger cylinder head with bigger fins, aluminum wheel rims and plenty of glossy red paint. The first year version (1954) of the 175 Sport featured a beautifully sculpted fuel tank that quickly earned it the unofficial nickname [...] "Disco Volante" [...] (flying saucer) as, viewed from the front, the tank shape was reminiscent of a flying saucer. Soon after, MV began offering a very limited-availability racing version 175cc [...] "Super Sport" [...] for MSDS racing (production club racing) equipped with unusual Earles-design front forks. In 1955, it was superseded by a new and improved Super Sport model with radical new styling and a five-speed gearbox. Its design earned it the nickname [...] "Squalo" [...] (Shark). This 175cc racing machine was very popular in Britain in the mid-1950s, where tuners learned <b>to</b> <b>bore</b> it <b>out</b> <b>to</b> over 200cc capacity. [...] Racers including Micheal O’Rourke, Derek Minter, and Bob Keeler raced the 175 and 125 Sport Competizione around Europe {{with a great deal of}} success. The marketing strategy of [...] "race it on Sunday, sell it on Monday" [...] was adhered to, and it worked. MV street motorcycles enjoyed immense popularity throughout Europe. In 1958 American rider Dave Schuler, riding a borrowed and barely modified MV 175 Sport street bike, won the 175 class at the famed Catalina Island GP off-road race, in California.|$|R
