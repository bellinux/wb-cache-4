5|$|A Link to the Past {{is one of}} {{the best-selling}} SNES games, with 4.61 million units sold worldwide, and has had an {{exceptionally}} long stay on Nintendo Powers top games list (ranking number 2 in Nintendo Power's last issue in December 2012): when the SNES list was finally retired, A Link to <b>the</b> <b>Past</b> <b>had</b> more than five consecutive years in the number one spot. It was re-released as a Player's Choice title in North America, indicating that it has sold a minimum of one million copies there. In the United States, A Link to the Pasts Game Boy Advance version alone sold 1.4 million copies and earned $41 million by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the 8th highest-selling game launched for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or PlayStation Portable in that country.|$|E

5|$|Cristina Yang, M.D., Ph.D., is {{a fictional}} {{character}} {{from the medical}} drama television series Grey's Anatomy, which has aired for over 12 years on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States. The character was created by series producer Shonda Rhimes, and is portrayed by actress Sandra Oh. Introduced as a surgical intern at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, Yang worked her way up to resident level, eventually becoming a cardiothoracic surgical fellow, while her relationships with colleagues Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), George O'Malley (T.

5|$|The Liverpool badge {{is based}} on the city's liver bird, which in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>had</b> been placed inside a shield. In 1992, to commemorate the centennial of the club, a new badge was commissioned, {{including}} a representation of the Shankly Gates. The next year twin flames were added at either side, symbolic of the Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield, where an eternal flame burns in memory of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster. In 2012, Warrior Sports' first Liverpool kit removed the shield and gates, returning the badge to what had adorned Liverpool shirts in the 1970s; the flames were moved to the back collar of the shirt, surrounding the number 96 for the number who died at Hillsborough.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins as}} Professor E. Gadd completes his newest {{invention}} {{of a time}} machine powered by a gem called the Cobalt Star, which is presented at Peach's Castle. Peach enters the time machine into the past, but fails to return, only leaving {{a member of an}} alien species known only as the Shroobs within the damaged time machine. The Mushroom Kingdom of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>had</b> actually been invaded by the Shroobs, with Peach being kidnapped and held hostage at her castle. After defeating the monster, a time hole opens, leaving a passageway into the past. While searching for Peach, Mario and Luigi locate their younger selves, and agree to locate the crystal shards, which are remnants of the Cobalt Star which had been shattered during Peach's journey. Unwittingly, the brothers collect all of the shards, while being pestered by Baby Bowser (Bowser in the past) who wants the Cobalt Star. At the end, they restore the Cobalt Star only to unleash the Elder Princess Shroob, who serves as the game's final boss character. The story ends when she is defeated, Peach is rescued, and the past returns to normal.|$|E

Since absolute pitch is rare in European musical culture, claims that any particular musician possessed it are difficult to evaluate. Among composers of the Baroque and Classical eras, evidence is available only for Mozart, who is documented to have demonstrated the ability at age 7. Experts have only surmised that Beethoven had it, as indicated from some excerpts from his letters. By the 19th century, it became more common {{for the presence of}} absolute pitch to be recorded, identifying the ability to be present in musicians such as Camille Saint-Saëns and John Philip Sousa.|$|E

25|$|There was {{excitement}} that The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News {{would be under}} local ownership {{for the first time}} since Walter Annenberg sold the paper to Knight Newspapers in 1969.

Tierney allayed fears by having the members of Philadelphia Media Holdings sign a pledge not to interfere with the paper's editorial independence.

25|$|As prime minister, David Cameron {{wanted to}} put family policy {{at the heart of}} the Conservative Party {{claiming}} British politics in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>had</b> got it wrong. He stated families should be the most important thing in the country's life, believing social responsibility and a strong family was key to an individuals success, and by extent becoming less reliant on the state. Both Cameron and Theresa May have aimed at helping families achieve a work-home balance and have previously proposed to offer all parents 12 months parental leave, to be shared by mother and father as they choose. Other policies have included doubling the free hours of childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds from 15 hours to 30 hours a week during term-time, and fund 15 hours a week of free childcare for all disadvantaged two-year-olds, worth £2,500 a year per child. Tax schemes to support families, freezing fuel duty, cutting income tax. David Cameron in a speech mentioned businesses will have to help cut the costs imposed on society and families through the decisions businesses make, by becoming more socially responsible which would in turn reduce the need for state control to solve the problem.|$|E
25|$|Little {{reliable}} information remains about {{the area in}} the 16th century following the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. Some state that the first Spanish settlement was founded by Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca in 1530, near Huépac. Others state that Francisco Vásquez de Coronado founded a village {{on the edge of the}} Yaqui River in 1540 on his way north. Another source states that the first Spanish presence was not until 1614, by missionaries such as Pedro Méndez and Pérez de Rivas, working with the Mayo. Unlike in central Mexico, no central social or economic centralization occurred in the Sonora area, given the collapse of population centers in the 15th century. The five traditions of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>had</b> broken down to a number of fractured ethnicities. No empire or other system was present for the Spaniards to co-opt for domination purposes. In addition, the Yaqui people resisted European intrusion on their lands, effectively keeping the Spaniards out of their area until the 17th century. While exploration of the area happened through the expeditions of the 16th century, significant permanent Spanish settlement did not become possible until the establishment of the mission system.|$|E

500|$|Despite the Mayo Foundation's {{arguments}} otherwise, the Court {{ruled that}} [...] "student" [...] was a sufficiently ambiguous term {{to state that}} Congress has specifically addressed the issue. The Court also noted that Congress in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>had</b> specifically singled out medical residents when making exemptions available, which in the Court's eyes made the Mayo Foundation's arguments about unambiguity unreasonable. Therefore, according to Chevron, {{the role of the}} courts should solely be to determine whether the Treasury Department made a reasonable decision—and the Court concluded that the Treasury did just that. In writing for the Court, Roberts stated that [...] "The [...] department certainly did not act irrationally in concluding that these doctors – 'who work long hours, serve as high [...] skilled professionals, and typically share {{some or all of the}} terms of employment of career employees' – are the kind of workers that Congress intended to both contribute and benefit from the Social Security system".|$|E
500|$|The story {{within a}} story drama The French Lieutenant's Woman (1981) was Streep's first leading role. The film paired Streep with Jeremy Irons as {{contemporary}} actors, telling their modern story, {{as well as}} the Victorian era drama they were performing. Streep perfected an English accent for the part, but considered herself a misfit for the role: [...] " [...] I couldn't help wishing that I was more beautiful". A New York magazine article commented that, while many female stars of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>had</b> cultivated a singular identity in their films, Streep was a [...] "chameleon", willing to play any type of role. Streep was awarded a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her work. The following year, she reunited with Robert Benton for the psychological thriller, Still of the Night (1982), co-starring Roy Scheider and Jessica Tandy. Vincent Canby, writing for The New York Times, noted that the film was an homage to the works of Alfred Hitchcock, but that one of its main weaknesses was a lack of chemistry between Streep and Scheider, concluding that Streep [...] "is stunning, but she's not on screen anywhere near long enough".|$|E
