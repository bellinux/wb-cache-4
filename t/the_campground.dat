5|$|As railroads {{began to}} become more common, {{attendance}} of the Mountain Grove Campground began to decline. The attendance of <b>the</b> <b>campground</b> dropped severely in 1891. On July 9, 1891, <b>the</b> <b>campground</b> placed an unusually large advertisement in a local newspaper. Attendance continued to drop in 1892. The decline continued, despite efforts by <b>the</b> <b>campground</b> directors {{to increase the number}} of Chautauqua speakers and religious speakers. Attempts were made throughout the 1890s to stave off the impending failure of <b>the</b> <b>campground,</b> but were largely unsuccessful. Later, the Board of Managers decided that they would open <b>the</b> <b>campground</b> specifically for special events, such as the Bloomsburg Methodist Church's plans for an eleven-car special train to carry picnickers and a band there. By the mid-1890s, it was permitted for visitors to bring their own supplies, rent multiple tents, and decide whether to stay for one or two weeks. A short branch line of the Danville, Hazleton, and Wilkes-Barre Railroad was then built to allow easier transport of visitors' baggage to <b>the</b> <b>campground.</b> Baggage carrying was also done for free and the attendance fee was also reduced. Only one of the twenty-five prominent local families who attended the camp meeting in the 1880s still attended it in the 1890s.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the operation of Mountain Grove Campground, the majority of people traveling there were worshipers. In the 1870s and 1880s, <b>the</b> <b>campground</b> was one of the three largest camp meeting sites that residents of Columbia County attended. In 1875, approximately 2500 people attended the camp meeting. In 1881, it was decided that all the profit generated from <b>the</b> <b>campground</b> would be dedicated to expansion and improvement of it. In 1891, the duration of the camp meeting was increased from seven to thirteen days. However, some people traveled there for a vacation. Within 20 years of the campground's opening, {{the majority of the people}} going there were there for a vacation, and trains carried bands and other entertainment-related items to <b>the</b> <b>campground.</b> However, people still continued to go there in large numbers for camp meeting. Local newspapers also began to advertise <b>the</b> <b>campground</b> as a resort instead of a camp meeting site. This began with an advertisement written by John R. Rote, secretary of the Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association, in the Columbia County Republican on July 9, 1891.|$|E

5000|$|Historic Photographs of Crystal Lake and the {{surrounding}} area from 1907 through the mid-1970s show that <b>the</b> <b>campgrounds</b> have been used by [...] "Singing cowboys" [...] during the era of black-and-white television, which used to feature cowboy shows. Because <b>the</b> <b>campgrounds</b> could be accessed from Angeles Crest Highway prior to the 1978 landslide, which demolished a half-mile section of California State Route 39 four miles (6 km) from Crystal Lake, Hollywood performers and other Los Angeles celebrities and politicians used to frequent <b>the</b> <b>campgrounds</b> because of <b>the</b> easy access across the San Gabriel Mountains.|$|R

5|$|Among the park's most {{distinctive}} and well-known features are the vehicular river crossings. At three places, crossing Pine Creek, fords were constructed instead of bridges. The fords offer visitors {{a chance to}} actually drive through the creek, though high water frequently closes the crossings. Hikers are relegated to pedestrian bridges or stepping stones in the creek to cross the stream. Floods are frequent enough on Pine Creek, a large watershed {{to the north of}} the park, that there is an emergency exit from <b>the</b> <b>campground.</b> When high water closes the fords, <b>the</b> <b>campground</b> is cut off and the emergency exit is the only way out.|$|E
5|$|Between the 1873 and the 1874 camp meeting seasons, the Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association {{added more}} tents to <b>the</b> <b>campground,</b> {{increasing}} their number to almost 200.

5|$|Several more {{expansions}} and renovations {{were made}} to the Mountain Grove Campground in the 1880s. In 1883, the boarding house was expanded and in 1885, a number of water pipes were renovated and some buildings were repaired and repainted. The main office of <b>the</b> <b>campground</b> was built in 1887. More renovations were done in 1889 and 1892, by which time there were 240 tents.|$|E
5|$|The Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association {{was formed}} after a {{decision}} by a nine-man committee. It was decided on August 19, 1872 that the company would be a joint-stock company. Its capital stock in 1873 was $14,000. G.M. Shoop was a significant stockholder in the company. He was the manager of <b>the</b> <b>campground</b> and the association secretary during the 1870s. High-ranking members of the Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association during the 1870s included Presiding Elder Barnes, Reverend S. Creighton, and the businessmen and politicians B.G. Welch, Mordecai W. Jackson, and A.J. Ammerman. The newspaper editor E.M. Wardin was also prominent within the association. In the early 1880s, the businessmen E.M.M. Low, Z.T. Fowler, and Lloyd T. Sharpless also became prominent in the association. <b>The</b> <b>campground</b> typically grossed approximately $4000 per year during the 1880s.|$|E

5|$|The {{dominant}} soil in Leonard Harrison State Park {{is somewhat}} excessively drained Oquaga channery loam, {{which is often}} associated with well drained Lordstown channery loam. Much of <b>the</b> <b>campground</b> near the eastern boundary is supported by Morris gravelly silt loam, which is somewhat poorly drained due to a subsoil fragipan.

5|$|The Red {{fire started}} near Lewis Lake on July 1 {{and like the}} Shoshone fire, {{advanced}} little for several weeks. The fire then moved northeast on July 19 and combined with the Shoshone fire in August. As these two fires advanced towards the Grant Village area, evacuations were ordered so fire fighting crews could concentrate on structure protection. In {{the midst of a}} large lodgepole pine forest, the Grant Village complex was the first major tourist area impacted that season. A number of small structures and some of <b>the</b> <b>campground</b> complex were destroyed. After the Red and Shoshone fires combined, they were referred to as the Shoshone fire, since it was much larger.|$|E
5|$|Though {{far from}} the United States, Dolly managed to bring heavy rain and high winds to {{southern}} Texas. Weekly rainfall totals in Corpus Christi reached 5.53in (141mm) and 2.82in (71.6mm) in Brownsville. Corpus Christi daily rainfall measurements on August23 and August24 were as high as 1.92in (48.8mm) and 2.55in (64.8), respectively, a new daily record. The beach at the Padre Island National Seashore was closed after high tides began flooding the beaches and the John F. Kennedy Causeway, though other facilities such as <b>the</b> <b>campground</b> remained open. A tornado was spawned near Olmito, damaging a few homes and unroofing two others.

5|$|During {{the week}} when Emily {{approached}} shore, the North Carolina government {{was scheduled to}} have a two-day emergency management exercise involving a hurricane strike; the storm caused the exercise to be postponed. On August29, a voluntary evacuation was issued for the Outer Banks, and within 36hours of the storm's approach, a mandatory evacuation was issued for Ocracoke and Hatteras Island. A total of 160,000people (mostly tourists) evacuated from the Outer Banks, representing about 90% of the population there. The evacuation was completed within 12hours, expedited by highway patrol and making U.S. Route 158 and the Wright Memorial Bridge only one direction, away from the coast. About 1,000residents on Hatteras Island and another 600 on Ocracoke rode out the storm in their homes. The United States Coast Guard evacuated personnel to the mainland, leaving behind a skeleton crew to maintain their facilities.
