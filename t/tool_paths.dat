NC <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> generation in dealing with sharp corners thus requires special consideration. This paper describes an improved NC <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> pattern for pocket milling.

Traditionally, the process planning of 2 pocket machining is posed as stand-alone problem involving either <b>tool</b> selection, <b>tool</b> <b>path</b> generation or machining parameter selection, resulting in sub-optimal plans.

In pocket milling the material inside an arbitrarily closed boundary on a flat surface of a work piece is removed to a fixed depth. Generally flat bottom end mills are used for pocket milling. Firstly roughing operation is done to remove the bulk of material and then the pocket is finished by a finish end mill.Most of the industrial milling operations can be taken care of by 2.5 axis CNC milling. This type of path control can machine up to 80% of all mechanical parts.

5000|$|The {{operational}} concept of EBF3 {{is to build}} a near-net-shape metal part directly from a computer-aided design (CAD) file. Current computer-aided machining practices start with a CAD model and use a post-processor to write the machining instructions (G-code) defining the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>paths</b> needed to make the part. EBF3 uses a similar process, starting with a CAD model, numerically slicing it into layers, then using a post-processor to write the G-code defining the deposition path and process parameters for the EBF3 equipment. It uses a focused electron beam in a vacuum environment to create a molten pool on a metallic substrate. The beam is translated with respect {{to the surface of the}} substrate while metal wire is fed into the molten pool. The deposit solidifies immediately after the electron beam has passed, having sufficient structural strength to support itself. The sequence is repeated in a layer-additive manner to produce a near-net-shape part needing only finish machining. The EBF3 process is scalable for components from fractions of an inch to tens of feet in size, limited mainly by the size of the vacuum chamber and amount of wire feedstock available.|$|E
