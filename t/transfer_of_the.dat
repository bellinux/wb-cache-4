5|$|The society's {{offer was}} the only one to include an {{existing}} building on its grounds. The Board of Regents accepted the society's offer, and a formal <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Romney Classical Institute's former campus was made. The society discovered that, in order to make good on its promise, it had to raise more than $1,000, a close to impossible task during the Reconstruction Era in Romney. Following a resolution on July 11, 1870, to raise between $1,200 and $1,300, a subscription of $1,383.60 was raised after 118 individuals and firms donated the needed funds, and shortly thereafter the formal <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> property was completed. At that time, the institute's property was valued at about $20,000.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} in February 1913, poet and lawyer Luis Lloréns Torres had {{publicly}} requested that Betances' wishes {{to have his}} ashes returned to Puerto Rico be fulfilled. The Nationalist Association (predecessor of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party), under the presidency of José Coll y Cuchí, was able to convince the Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly to approve an act {{that would allow the}} <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mortal remains of Puerto Rican patriot Ramón Emeterio Betances from Paris, France to Puerto Rico. Seven years after the act's approval, the Legislative Assembly commissioned one of its delegates, Alfonso Lastra Charriez, to serve as an emissary and bring Betances' remains from France.|$|E

5|$|Auberge d'Italie was {{the third}} Italian auberge {{to be built in}} Malta. The first auberge was built in Birgu in the 1550s, on the site of an earlier {{building}} which had been used by the Langue of Italy. Following the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capital city from Birgu to Valletta, a second auberge was built in the centre of the new city in 1570–71. This building was eventually incorporated into the Grandmaster's Palace, and the present auberge began to be built in Strada San Giacomo (now Merchants Street). The original designs of both Valletta auberges were made by the Maltese architect Girolamo Cassar.|$|E

The <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal was effective from 24 June 1971.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{aspects of}} the {{negotiations}} leading to the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> codex to the Tsar's possession are open to an interpretation that reflects adversely on Tischendorf's candour and good faith with the monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery. For a recent account intended to exculpate him of blame, see Erhard Lauch's article 'Nichts gegen Tischendorf' in Bekenntnis zur Kirche: Festgabe für Ernst Sommerlath zum 70. Geburtstag (Berlin, c. 1961); for an account that includes a hitherto unknown receipt given by Tischendorf to the authorities at the monastery promising to return the manuscript from Saint Petersburg 'to the Holy Confraternity of Sinai at its earliest request'.|$|E

5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} the study and {{modelling}} of the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inert gas component of breathing gases from the gas in the lungs to the tissues of the diver and back during exposure to variations in ambient pressure. In the case of underwater diving and compressed air work, this mostly involves ambient pressures greater than the local surface pressure—but astronauts, high altitude mountaineers, and occupants of unpressurized aircraft, are exposed to ambient pressures less than standard sea level atmospheric pressure. In all cases, the symptoms of decompression sickness occur during or within {{a relatively short period}} of hours, or occasionally days, after a significant reduction of ambient pressure.|$|E
5|$|For four years, Episode 1 of Invasion of the Dinosaurs was {{the only}} Pertwee episode to be entirely missing from the archives, until a {{black-and-white}} 16mm copy was returned to the Corporation in June 1983.

With one exception, archival holdings from Death to the Daleks Episode 2 onwards are complete on the original broadcast videotapes.|$|E

As part of the ceasefire agreement accepted by the Norwegians in Western Norway in the evening of 1 May 1940, Kommandøren was {{to be handed over}} to the Germans, along with the ferry Lærdal and 40 smaller boats. The <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ships occurred at Lærdal on 2 May, and the ceasefire was announced on 3 May. The Germans used Kommandøren and the other vessels for a limited period to transport troops to occupy various places in Western Norway.|$|E

The II Division, including Friedrich der Grosse, served as the training squadron in the winter of 1890–1891. The squadron again cruised the Mediterranean, under the command of Rear Admiral Wilhelm Schröder. Friedrich der Grosse again saw service in the II Division in the winter of 1891–1892 and the 1892 maneuvers, under the command of Rear Admiral Hans Koester.|$|E
5|$|In August, Ferdinand's envoys {{had demanded}} the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late John Zápolya's realm to Ferdinand in {{accordance}} with the Treaty of Várad. Peter Perényi, who had been the commander of Zápolya's troops in Upper Hungary, and Franjo Frankopan, Archbishop of Kalocsa, soon deserted to Ferdinand. The wealthy Stephen Majláth expelled most of John Sigismund's supporters from Transylvania in an attempt to seize the province for himself. Ferdinand's envoy, Hieronymus Łaski, informed Suleiman of the Treaty of Várad, asking the sultan to consent to the unification of Hungary under Ferdinand's rule. Instead, the sultan stated that he supported John Sigismund and had Łaski arrested.|$|E
