5|$|Isa's {{relations}} with Baybars were generally on good terms, {{though there were}} occasional exceptions. Isa accompanied al-Mustansir, the newly inaugurated Abbasid caliph, on his Mamluk-sponsored campaign to reclaim Iraq from the Mongols in 1260. However, al-Mustansir was killed en route to Baghdad in a Mongol ambush. The next year, Isa was present in Cairo <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>witness</b> that al-Mustansir's successor and kinsman, al-Hakim, was indeed {{a member of the}} Abbasid line.|$|E

The trial was convened November 26 under Judge Harding, with the widow of Patrick Langan, one of those slain on August 1, named as prosecutor. Of the 20 subpoenaed by the prosecution <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>witness</b> to the peaceful nature of the protest, only six appeared to testify. Three admitted to seeing violence committed by the mob prior to the shooting. Many more testified {{on behalf of the}} accused.|$|E

25|$|In the Catholic Church, a Eucharistic Congress is a {{gathering}} of clergy, religious, and laity <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>witness</b> to the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, which is an important Roman Catholic doctrine. Congresses bring together people from a wide area, and typically involve large open-air Masses, Eucharistic adoration (Blessed Sacrament), and other devotional ceremonies held over several days. Congresses may both refer to National (varies by country) and International Eucharistic Congresses.|$|E
25|$|The {{final scene}} {{takes place in}} the Phantom's Chapel, with his organ and its unkempt riot of sheet music as a center-piece. He seems {{determined}} to wed Christine and expresses his love for her ("Ne'er Forsake Me, Here Remain"). As the song ends, Christine tears off his mask and The Phantom screams in anger and shame, hiding his face from Christine. His sobs fade and he turns back, with a determined and violent look in his eyes, and produces a Priest and Chorus Girl <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>witness</b> to the forced marriage between him and Christine. But just in time, Raoul, The Persian {{and the rest of the}} group burst in, having escaped the Boiler Room and come through The Phantom's traps. The Phantom, suddenly finding himself in a tight spot, produces a knife and pulls Christine in front of him. In act of love to Christine, The Phantom stabs himself with his own dagger and dies in Christine's arms ("Ne'er Forsake me, Here Remain").Christine remarks that The Phantom was always the angel of music ("He Will Not Go Without A Friend").|$|E
25|$|Socrates says {{he never}} was a (paid) teacher; therefore, he is not {{responsible}} for the corruption of any Athenian citizen. That if he corrupted anyone, he asks: why have they not come forward <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>witnesses?</b> That if the corrupted Athenians are ignorant of having been corrupted, then why have their families not spoken on their behalf? In point of fact, Socrates indicates relatives of the Athenian youth he supposedly corrupted are present in court, giving him moral support.|$|R

25|$|The title Handbook for a Confessor (also Old English Handbook, or in full, Late Old English Handbook for the Use of a Confessor), {{refers to}} a {{compilation}} of Old English and Latin penitential texts associated with – and possibly authored or adapted by – Wulfstan (II), Archbishop of York (d. 1023). The handbook was intended {{for the use of}} parish priests in hearing confession and determining penances. Its transmission in the manuscripts (see below) seems <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>witness</b> to Wulfstan's profound concern with these sacraments and their regulation, an impression which is similarly borne out by his Canons of Edgar, a guide of ecclesiastical law also targeted at priests. The handbook is a derivative work, based largely on earlier vernacular representatives of the penitential genre such as the Scrifboc (or Confessionale Pseudo-Ecgberhti) and the Old English Penitential (or Paenitentiale Pseudo-Ecgberhti). Nevertheless, a unique quality seems to lie in the more or less systematic way it seeks to integrate various points of concern, including the proper formulae for confession and instructions on the administration of confession, the prescription of penances and their commutation.|$|E
25|$|A second clause {{promotes}} alliance {{by making}} reassurances of aid, most likely military support, if either party is {{attacked by a}} third party or by internal forces of rebellion or insurgency. The other stipulations coincide with Hattušiliš' aims (consult Hittite aims section) in that the Hittite ruler placed great emphasis on establishing legitimacy for his rule: each country swore to the other to extradite political fugitives back to their home country and within the Hittite version of the treaty Ramesses II agreed to provide support to Hattušiliš' successors in order to hold the Hittite throne against dissenters. After {{the conclusion of the}} provision detailing the extradition of emigrants to their land of origin, the two rulers call upon the respective gods of Hatti and Egypt <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>witness</b> to their agreement. The inclusion of the gods is a common feature in major pieces of international law since only a direct appeal to the gods could provide the proper means to guarantee adherence to the treaty. Their noted ability to bestow curses and blessings to people is employed as a serious penalty that would be imposed in case of a violation.|$|E

2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the ICRC {{is not a}} {{sovereign}} entity like the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and also {{it is not an}} international organization, neither of non-governmental nor of governmental type.

However, since the early 1990s, the ICRC employs persons {{from all over the world}} to serve in its field mission and at Headquarters. In 2007, almost half of ICRC staff was non-Swiss.
