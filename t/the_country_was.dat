5|$|A {{country that}} had been {{reported}} to be a likely early export customer for the modernized Su-35 was Venezuela. The Venezuelan government of Hugo Chavez in July 2006 placed an order for 24 Su-30MK2s to replace its fleet of F-16s that were subjected to a US arms embargo. The aircraft were delivered to the Venezuelan Air Force from 2006 to 2008. <b>The</b> <b>country</b> <b>was</b> expected to follow up with a second order for the same type, or make a purchase of the Su-35. Despite subsequent reports that the Venezuelan government were interested in the aircraft and had placed an order for the Su-35, <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>was</b> negotiating with Russia in 2016 for the Su-30 aircraft instead.|$|E

5|$|Armenians {{began to}} arrive in the US in {{unprecedented}} numbers {{in the late nineteenth}} century, most notably after the Hamidian Massacres of 1894–96, and before, during and after the Armenian Genocide.

5|$|Despite this policy, Belgium was invaded {{without warning}} by German forces on 10 May 1940. After 18 days of fighting, the Belgian {{military}} surrendered on 28 May and <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>was</b> {{placed under the}} control of a German military government. Between 600,000 and 650,000 Belgian men (nearly 20% of the country's male population) had been mobilized to fight.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{deployment}} to Syria of several new Russian military systems, various countries had reportedly {{expressed interest in}} the Su-35. These countries included Algeria, Egypt, and Vietnam. According to Kommersant, the Algerian military had requested an Su-35 for testing in February 2016; <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>was</b> satisfied with the fighter's flight characteristics and so Moscow is waiting for a formal application. It is expected that the first phase {{will focus on the}} acquisition of at least twelve aircraft. Other countries that had also expressed interest in the aircraft include Kazakhstan, North Korea, and Pakistan, although a Russian official denied that <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>was</b> in talks with the latter about the Su-35.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>was</b> {{also influenced by}} American cinema, {{and many of his}} illustrations were based on cinematic imagery.

5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>was</b> liberated by the Allies between September and October 1944, though {{areas to}} the far east of the country {{remained}} occupied until early 1945. In total, approximately 88,000 Belgians died during the conflict, a figure representing 1.05 percent of the country's pre-war population, and around 8 percent of the country's GDP was destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The Holocaust in Albania {{consisted}} of murders, deportations and {{crimes against humanity}} committed against Jews, Slavs, Roma and other minorities in Greater Albania by German, Italian and Albanian collaborationist forces while <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>was</b> under Italian and German occupation during the Second World War. Throughout the war, nearly 2,000 Jews sought refuge in Albania-proper. Most of these Jewish refugees were treated well by the local Albanian population, {{despite the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>was</b> occupied first by Fascist Italy, and then by Nazi Germany. Albanians, following a traditional custom of hospitality known as , often sheltered Jewish refugees in mountain villages, and transported them to Adriatic ports from where they fled to Italy.

5|$|A plan {{to control}} {{materials}} coming into <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>was</b> put forward in early 1937, effectively subjecting the Spanish Republic to international isolation, but was mocked by German and Italian decisive and immediate {{support for the}} rebel faction. The subject of volunteers was also much discussed, with little result; although agreements were signed late on in the war, these were made outside the Committee. Efforts to stem the flow of war materials to Spain were largely unsuccessful, with foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War proving instrumental to its outcome. Nazi Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union consistently broke the agreement they had signed, France occasionally so. Britain remained largely faithful to it.|$|E

5|$|A {{siege of}} the castle was started, but through papal {{intervention}} King Henry later entered on a more conciliatory path. A commission was appointed to draw up an arrangement that would be acceptable to both sides. The resulting Dictum of Kenilworth offered the rebels {{the right to buy}} back forfeited estates, at prices depending on their level of involvement in the rebellion. After initial resistance, the terms were eventually accepted. By the summer of 1267, <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>was</b> pacified, and this spirit of reconciliation would last until the 1290s.

5|$|According to USA Today, the match-up {{between the}} Longhorns and the Ohio State Buckeyes (OSU) {{was one of}} the most-anticipated games of the 2005season.

Because of the significance of the game in the national championship race, ESPN College GameDay chose the game as the site of its weekly broadcast.
