5|$|DNA {{sequencing}} of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes yielded relationships quite different; the three New World pelicans formed one lineage, with the American white pelican sister {{to the two}} brown pelicans, and the five Old World species the other. The Dalmatian, pink-backed and spot-billed were all closely related to one another, while the Australian white pelican was their next-closest relative. The great white pelican also belonged to this lineage but {{was the first to}} diverge from the common ancestor of the other four species. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> that pelicans evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas, and that preference for tree- or ground-nesting is more related to size than genetics.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{also can}} be {{evaluated}} by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in blood samples. EP {{is a part of}} red blood cells known to increase when the amount of lead in the blood is high, with a delay of a few weeks. Thus EP levels in conjunction with blood lead levels can suggest the time period of exposure; if blood lead levels are high but EP is still normal, <b>this</b> <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> exposure was recent. However, the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated blood lead levels below about 35μg/dL. Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP levels also increase in iron deficiency, use of this method for detecting lead exposure has decreased.|$|E

25|$|Another {{follow-up}} {{study examined the}} extent to which the statistical information learned during this type of artificial grammar learning feeds into knowledge that infants may already have about their native language. Infants preferred to listen to words over part-words, whereas there was no significant difference in the nonsense frame condition. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> that even pre-linguistic infants are able to integrate the statistical cues they learn in a laboratory into their previously-acquired knowledge of a language. In other words, once infants have acquired some linguistic knowledge, they incorporate newly acquired information into that previously-acquired learning.|$|E

30|$|The {{differences}} in chemical shifts were measured after assigning both the spectra of the oxidized and reduced forms (Fig.  3 B). Most {{of the changes}} in chemical shift took place in the residues close to the disulfide bond area, especially near the residue C 122. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>suggested</b> that the C 122 area was likely to undergo greater structural changes compared with the C 164 residue area.|$|R
25|$|The human mouth {{moves in}} {{distinct}} ways during speech production. When producing each individual sound out loud, humans use {{different parts of}} their mouths, as well as different methods to produce particular sounds. During the beginnings of babbling, infants tend to have greater mouth openings on the right side. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> that babbling {{is controlled by the}} left hemisphere of the brain. The larynx, or voicebox, is originally high in the throat which allows the baby to continue to breathe while swallowing. It descends {{during the first year of}} life, allowing the pharynx to develop and facilitates the production of adult-like speech sounds.|$|E
25|$|Studies suggest gender {{differences}} in the reminiscence bump. Researchers found that men have more positive life events in their thirties and that women have more positive life events in their twenties. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> that the timing of important positive life events, such as marriage or employment, differ for men and women. Most of the major life events start between the age of 15 and 30 but there is a small gender difference shown here with respect to when the event takes place. Researchers found that women have a slightly earlier bump than men. The earlier age of the bump in women may be attributed to earlier hormonal changes in adolescence.|$|E
25|$|The cue {{familiarity}} {{hypothesis was}} proposed by Reder and Ritter after completing {{a pair of}} experiments which indicated that individuals can evaluate their ability {{to answer a question}} before trying to answer it. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> that the question (cue) and not the actual memory (target) is crucial for making metamemory judgments. Consequently, this hypothesis implies that judgements regarding metamemory are based on an individual’s level of familiarity with the information provided in the cue. Therefore, an individual is more likely to judge that they know the answer to a question if they are familiar with its topic or terms and more likely to judge that they do not know the answer to a question which presents new or unfamiliar terms.|$|E

25|$|The enzyme is {{also thought}} {{to act as}} a safety valve for stress {{conditions}} in the photosynthetic apparatus. By providing an electron sink when the plastoquinone pool is over-reduced, the oxidase is thought to protect photosystem II from oxidative damage. Knockouts for Rubisco and photosystem II complexes, which would experience more photodamage than normal, exhibit an upregulation of plastid terminal oxidase. This effect is not universal because it requires plants to have additional PTOX regulation mechanisms. While many studies agree with the stress-protective role of the enzyme, one study showed that overexpression of PTOX increases the production of reactive oxygen species and causes more photodamage than normal. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> that an efficient antioxidant system is required for the oxidase to function as a safety valve for stress conditions and that it is more important during chloroplast biogenesis than in the regular functioning of the chloroplast.|$|E
25|$|LGV {{was first}} {{described}} by Wallace in 1833 and again by Durand, Nicolas, and Favre in 1913. Since the 2004 Dutch outbreak many additional {{cases have been}} reported, leading to greater surveillance. Soon after the initial Dutch report, national and international health authorities launched warning initiatives and multiple LGV cases were identified in several more European countries (Belgium, France, the UK, Germany, Sweden, Italy and Switzerland) and the US and Canada. All cases reported in Amsterdam and France and a considerable percentage of LGV infections in the UK and Germany were caused by a newly discovered Chlamydia variant, L2b, a.k.a. the Amsterdam variant. The L2b variant could be traced back and was isolated from anal swabs of {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) who visited the STI city clinic of San Francisco in 1981. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> that the recent LGV outbreak among MSM in industrialised countries is a slowly evolving epidemic. The L2b serovar has also been identified in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Since {{replication}} machineries do {{not move}} relatively to template DNAs such as factories, they are called a replication factory. In an alternative figure, DNA factories are similar to projectors and DNAs are like as cinematic films passing constantly into the projectors. In the replication factory model, after both DNA helicases for leading strands and lagging strands are loaded on the template DNAs, the helicases run along the DNAs into each other. The helicases remain associated {{for the remainder of}} replication process. Peter Meister et al. observed directly replication sites in budding yeast by monitoring green fluorescent protein(GFP)-tagged DNA polymerases α. They detected DNA replication of pairs of the tagged loci spaced apart symmetrically from a replication origin and found that the distance between the pairs decreased markedly by time. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> that the mechanism of DNA replication goes with DNA factories. That is, couples of replication factories are loaded on replication origins and the factories associated with each other. Also, template DNAs move into the factories, which bring extrusion of the template ssDNAs and nascent DNAs. Meister’s finding is the first direct evidence of replication factory model. Subsequent research has shown that DNA helicases form dimers in many eukaryotic cells and bacterial replication machineries stay in single intranuclear location during DNA synthesis.|$|E

Map-based cloning demonstrated that reduced transcription of GNS 4 {{caused by an}} SNP in its promoter region resulted in the mutant phenotype. Down-regulation of GNS 4 by RNAi also resulted in smaller panicles and grains. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>suggested</b> that GNS 4 plays a positive role in regulating panicle and grain size in rice.|$|R

500|$|Many {{economists are}} sceptical about the {{economic}} benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasising that such [...] "mega-events" [...] often have large costs while yielding relatively few tangible benefits in the long run. Conversely hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country's exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games. Moreover, research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a strong {{positive effect on the}} philanthropic contributions of corporations headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector. This positive effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards, although not permanently. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> that hosting the Olympics might create opportunities for cities to influence local corporations in ways that benefit the local nonprofit sector and civil society.|$|E
