5|$|In 1950 while {{teaching}} {{political science and}} serving as dean of students at Willamette, Hatfield began his political career by winning election to the Oregon House of Representatives as a Republican. He defeated six others for the seat {{at a time when}} state assembly elections were still determined by county-wide votes. He served for two terms representing Marion County and Salem in the lower chamber of the Oregon Legislative Assembly. At the time he was the youngest legislator in Oregon and still lived at his parents' home. Hatfield would teach early-morning classes and then walk across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Capitol to legislate.|$|E
5|$|After {{stepping}} out of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the Doctor is blown off his feet by a blast of air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the disturbance to the second floor of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second floor flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E

A 66th Street Local-Express powered by Locomotive #135 was the last steam operated passenger train on the line.

On June 3, 1903, the 110th Street station opened, with four elevators to get passengers up from <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> downtown platform and the mezzanine level for uptown trains. The station had to be built with elevators because it was 63 feet above street level, and was the highest station on the line. Some say that the tower, which had the elevators, lasted into the early 1970s.|$|E

25|$|Sheriff Wann {{stood in}} front of the jail and {{addressed}} the mob, saying he would kill the first person to come through the door.

He walked across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> courthouse where he telephoned Governor Benjamin M. Miller, who mobilized the Alabama Army National Guard to protect the jail. He took the defendants to the county seat of Gadsden, Alabama, for indictment and to await trial.

After getting behind early, the change of scenery didn’t hurt the team {{in the long run}} though, as they posted 19–15 come from behind victory in front of an overflow crowd. The win gave the team a 23–17 record, and clinched the division and conference titles. This would also be the only home game during the Drillers four years and change that was not played at Edmonton Coliseum/Skyreach Centre, as well as the club's only conference title.|$|E

Accompanied by one or two bodyguards, he crossed <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Triangle Civic Improvement Association — a dingy storefront club that served as his headquarters — where he played pinochle and held whispered conversations with his associates. Regular visitors to the Triangle included senior Genovese caporegimes Liborio Bellomo, John Ardito, Tino Fiumara, Ernest Muscarella and Daniel Leo.

25|$|The area {{closest to}} Trumpington Street is {{referred}} to as First Court.

It was extended towards the road in 1633 and features interior woodwork that was added in 1641-8 by William Ashley, who was also responsible for similar woodwork in the chapel. Electric lighting was added to the library in 1937. The area above the Perne Library was used as the Ward Library (the college's general purpose library) from 1952 to 1984, but that has now been moved to its own building in the north-west corner of the college site.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of the century, in keeping with the ides of the Enlightenment, the {{administration}} of Paris, particularly the police, made an effort to improve the way that the city looked and functioned. One example was the sidewalk; in mid-century sidewalks existed in London, but there were none in Paris. The first sidewalk in Paris was begun in 1781, along the new rue du Théâtre Française, now rue de l’Odéon, to protect the spectators going along <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new theater. The second sidewalk was begun in 1788 along rue Louvois, where another new theater was planned. The sidewalk was four feet wide (1.2 meters) and 10 to 12 inches (thirty centimeters) high, with a stone border. Before the end of the century, several more sidewalks were installed along new streets in the wealthy neighborhoods around the quarter of la Chaussée d'Antin.|$|E
