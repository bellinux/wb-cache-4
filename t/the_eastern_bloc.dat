5|$|Nonetheless, {{some social}} scientists, such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Frank Gibney, refer to these changes as a revolution, one less {{dramatic}} than its Hungarian counterpart but one {{which may have}} had an even more profound impact on <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc.</b> Timothy Garton Ash calls the Polish October the most significant event in the post-war history of Poland until the rise of Solidarity. History professor Iván T. Berend claims that while {{the effects of the}} Polish October on <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> may be disputed, it set the course for the eventual fall of communism in the People's Republic of Poland.|$|E

5|$|While Stalin's {{death in}} 1953 {{slightly}} relaxed tensions, {{the situation in}} Europe remained an uneasy armed truce. The Soviets, who had already created a network of mutual assistance treaties in <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> by 1949, established a formal alliance therein, the Warsaw Pact, in 1955.|$|E

50|$|In {{the years}} before 1989 and the {{break-up}} of the Soviet Union, the Klarsfelds (Serge Klarsfeld and his wife Beate) frequently protested against <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc's</b> support for <b>the</b> PLO and anti-Zionism.|$|R
2500|$|A {{different}} camp {{supported and}} encouraged Brandt's Neue Ostpolitik as aiming at [...] "Wandel durch Annäherung" [...] ("change through rapprochement"), encouraging change through {{a policy of}} engagement with <b>the</b> (communist) <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc,</b> {{rather than trying to}} isolate those countries diplomatically and commercially. Brandt's supporters claim that the policy did help to break down <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc's</b> [...] "siege mentality", and also helped to increase its awareness of the contradictions in its brand of Socialism/Communism, which – together with other events – eventually led to <b>the</b> downfall of <b>Eastern</b> European Communism.|$|R
5|$|With {{the fall}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> ceased to exist; with it, so did all {{applicability}} of the term Second World. The definitions of the First World and Third World changed slightly, yet generally described the same concepts.|$|E
5|$|Diplomatic {{relations}} between Cuba and the United States continued {{for some time}} after Batista's fall, but President Eisenhower deliberately left the capital to avoid meeting Cuba's young revolutionary leader Fidel Castro during the latter's trip to Washington in April, leaving Vice President Richard Nixon to conduct the meeting in his place. Cuba began negotiating arms purchases from <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> in March 1960.|$|E
5|$|In September 1947, the Soviets created Cominform, {{the purpose}} of which was to enforce orthodoxy within the {{international}} communist movement and tighten political control over Soviet satellites through coordination of communist parties in <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc.</b> Cominform faced an embarrassing setback the following June, when the Tito–Stalin Split obliged its members to expel Yugoslavia, which remained communist but adopted a non-aligned position.|$|E

5|$|Media in <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> was {{an organ}} of the state, {{completely}} reliant on and subservient to the communist party, with radio and television organizations being state-owned, while print media was usually owned by political organizations, mostly by the local communist party. Soviet propaganda used Marxist philosophy to attack capitalism, claiming labor exploitation and war-mongering imperialism were inherent in the system.|$|E
5|$|Poland's {{communist}} government attempted {{to destroy the}} union by instituting martial law in 1981, followed by several years of political repression, {{but in the end}} was forced into negotiation. The Roundtable Talks {{between the government and the}} Solidarity-led opposition resulted in semi-free elections in 1989. By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed, and, in December 1990, Wałęsa was elected president. This was soon followed by the dismantling of the {{communist government}}al system and by Poland's transformation into a modern democratic state. Solidarity's early survival represented a break in the hard-line stance of the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR), and was an unprecedented event; not only for the People's Republic of Poland—a satellite of the USSR ruled by a one-party communist regime—but for the whole of <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>bloc.</b> Solidarity's example led to the spread of anti-communist ideas and movements throughout <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc,</b> weakening communist governments. This process later culminated in the Revolutions of 1989.|$|E
5|$|After the Communist Party {{seized power}} in Czechoslovakia in February 1948, the city {{became part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc.</b> The city annexed new land, and the {{population}} rose significantly, becoming 90% Slovak. Large residential areas consisting of high-rise prefabricated panel buildings, {{such as those in}} the Petržalka borough, were built. The Communist government also built several new grandiose buildings, such as the Most Slovenského národného povstania bridge and the Slovak Radio headquarters.|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, Mitterrand {{was worried}} by the rapidity of <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>bloc's</b> collapse. He {{was opposed to}} German reunification but came {{to see it as}} unavoidable. [...] He was opposed to the swift {{recognition}} of Croatia and Slovenia, which he thought would lead to the violent implosion of Yugoslavia.|$|R
5|$|After the Second World Congress in 1948, the International Secretariat {{attempted}} to open communications with Josip Broz Tito's regime in Yugoslavia. In their analysis, it {{differed from the}} rest of <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> because it was established by the partisans of World War II who had fought against Nazi occupation, as opposed to by Stalin's invading armies. The British RCP, led by Jock Haston and supported by Ted Grant, were highly critical of this move.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{consolidating}} Stalin's {{control over}} <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc,</b> the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), led by Lavrentiy Beriya, supervised {{the establishment of}} Soviet-style secret police systems in the Bloc {{that were supposed to}} crush anti-communist resistance. When the slightest stirrings of independence emerged in the Bloc, Stalin's strategy matched that of dealing with domestic pre-war rivals: they were removed from power, put on trial, imprisoned, and in several instances, executed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the opening}} stages of World War II, the Soviet Union laid the {{foundation}} for <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> by invading and then annexing several countries as Soviet Socialist Republics, by agreement with Nazi Germany in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. These included eastern Poland (incorporated into two different SSRs), Latvia (which became the Latvian SSR), Estonia (which became the Estonian SSR), Lithuania (which became the Lithuanian SSR), part of eastern Finland (which became the Karelo-Finnish SSR) and eastern Romania (which became the Moldavian SSR).|$|E

5|$|In 1980-81 {{representatives from}} <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> nations {{met at the}} Kremlin to discuss the Polish situation. Brezhnev {{eventually}} concluded on 10 December 1981 {{that it would be}} better to leave the domestic matters of Poland alone, reassuring the Polish delegates that the USSR would intervene only if asked to. This effectively marked the end of the Brezhnev Doctrine. With domestic matters escalating out of control in Poland, Wojciech Jaruzelski imposed a state of war, the Polish version of martial law, on 12 December 1981.|$|E
5|$|Polish October, {{also known}} as October 1956, Polish thaw, or Gomułka's thaw, marked {{a change in the}} {{politics}} of Poland {{in the second half of}} 1956.

5|$|Under Quwatli's leadership, Syria {{increasingly}} moved {{towards a}} neutralist policy amid the Cold War, despite the conservative views held by Quwatli. However, on 10 September, Quwatli first opted {{to make an}} official request for arms from the United States, but was eventually rebuffed despite support from US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. Starting in 1956, Quwatli began to look towards <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>bloc</b> for economic and military assistance. During the tenure of his administration, Quwatli furthered Syria's relations with other neutralist countries such as Yugoslavia, India and Egypt, {{but also with the}} Soviet Union (USSR) and <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>bloc.</b> The pursuit of this policy was partially due to the support afforded to the leftist movements in Syria by the Saudi and Egyptian governments who viewed them as strong opponents of the Baghdad Pact, and the highly influential leftist factions of the Syrian Army. Quwatli and Nasser initiated the Egyptian-Syrian Agreement, a defense arrangement that would serve as a counterweight to the Baghdad Pact, in March 1955. The agreement stipulated that each country would assist the other in case of an attack, the establishment of numerous committees to coordinate joint military activities {{and the creation of a}} joint military command headed by Egyptian officer Abdel Hakim Amer. The agreement was concluded 20 October.|$|E
