5|$|On 19 December 1582, a {{proclamation}} in {{his name}} established parity for Catholics and Calvinists in <b>the</b> <b>Electorate</b> of Cologne, causing a scandal in the Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire, and after his marriage in February 1583, he sought to convert <b>the</b> <b>Electorate</b> into a dynastic dignity. For the next six years, his supporters fought those of the Catholic cathedral chapter {{for the right to}} hold the electorship and the archdiocese in the so-called Cologne War or Seneschal War. After brutal fighting, and the plundering of villages, cities, and abbeys throughout <b>the</b> <b>Electorate,</b> Gebhard surrendered his claim on <b>the</b> <b>electorate</b> and retired to Strasbourg. He died there in 1601 and was buried in the Cathedral.|$|E

Perth's main gay venues, Connections Nightclub and the Court Hotel, as well as events such as the Pride Parade and Fairday, are located in <b>the</b> <b>electorate.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Gebhard's expulsion, Ernst assumed full {{charge of}} <b>the</b> <b>Electorate</b> of Cologne. In his later years, a nuncio at Cologne took {{responsibilities}} {{for the financial}} administration of the archdiocese, and Ernst's nephew, Ferdinand of Bavaria, {{was elected to the}} Cathedral Chapter, the Wittelsbach heir-apparent. When Ernst died in 1612, the Cathedral Chapter duly elected his nephew to the position and Wittelsbachs held <b>the</b> <b>Electorate</b> until 1761. Ernst's victory, both in winning the election in 1583, and in convincing the assembly of other electors to accept him in 1585, confirmed him as the new archbishop of Cologne and gave the Wittelsbach family a foothold on the northern Rhine.|$|E

5|$|Agnes and Gebhard {{married on}} 2February 1583 in Bonn and retired to the Elector's country seat in Poppelsdorf to {{celebrate}} their nuptials. Within weeks, the Cathedral chapter had deposed Gebhard, electing in his place an old opponent, Ernst of Bavaria, the brother of Wilhelm V, Duke of Bavaria, who immediately set about raising an army {{with the help of}} his brother the duke, and his second brother, Ferdinand of Bavaria. In the spring and summer, Agnes and Gebhard did likewise, traveling to different parts of <b>the</b> <b>electorate,</b> raising an army, and extending the Protestant cause. By October, Ernst's brother Ferdinand entered <b>the</b> <b>electorate</b> from the south, near Koblenz. In their northward progress, they left a path of fire and destruction. Agnes and Gebhard fled, as Poppelsdorf, then Godesberg, and later the capital city of <b>the</b> <b>electorate,</b> Bonn, were over-run and destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Agnes of Mansfeld-Eisleben was a Protestant canoness (meaning {{that she}} was a woman living in a {{religious}} community, but not bound by a perpetual vow) at a convent in Gerresheim, today a district of Düsseldorf. After 1579, she maintained a lengthy liaison with the Archbishop of Cologne, Gebhard of Waldburg-Trauchburg, Truchsess of Waldburg. In defense of her honor, two of her brothers convinced Gebhard to marry her, and Gebhard considered converting to Calvinism for her. Rumors spread throughout <b>the</b> <b>Electorate</b> of his possible conversion, and that he might refuse to relinquish his position. <b>The</b> <b>Electorate</b> had overcome similar problems. Hermann of Wied had converted to Protestantism and resigned in 1547. Salentin of Isenburg-Grenzau, Gebhard's immediate predecessor, had resigned upon his marriage. In December 1582, Gebhard announced his conversion and extended equal religious rights to Protestants in <b>the</b> <b>Electorate.</b> In February, he married Agnes. At the end of March 1583, the Pope excommunicated him. The Cathedral chapter promptly elected a new archbishop, Ernst of Bavaria.|$|E
5|$|By Spring 1588, Gebhard {{had run out}} of options. In 1583, he {{had refused}} the {{settlement}} offered to him after the conferences at Frankfurt and in Westphalia, counting on the support of the other Protestant electors. When their support did not materialize, he pursued diplomatic options with the French, the Dutch, and the English; these also were of limited help. After the destruction of Neuss in 1586, and the loss of the most of southern part of <b>the</b> <b>Electorate</b> in 1587, Rheinberg and its environs were the only territories of <b>the</b> <b>Electorate</b> he could claim, and much of this slipped from his grasp in 1588. He had exhausted his diplomatic, financial and military possibilities. His health problems (referred to as Gelenkenschmerz, or joint pain) prohibited him from riding, which limited his ability to travel. In the spring of 1588, he relinquished his claim on <b>the</b> <b>Electorate</b> to the protection of Neuenahr and Martin Schenck, and retired to Strassburg. Neuenahr and Schenck continued to fight for him, but the former died in an artillery explosion in 1589, and the latter was killed at Nijmegen that summer. Without them to defend his claim on <b>the</b> <b>Electorate,</b> Rheinberg, Gebhard's last outpost in the northern Electorate, fell to Parma's force in 1589.|$|E

50|$|The country quota applied until 1945 and <b>the</b> Rotorua <b>electorate</b> was {{initially}} classed as fully rural. Based on the 1926 census, the 1927 Electoral Redistribution determined that 24% of <b>the</b> <b>electorate's</b> population was urban. Based on the 1936 census, the 1937 Electoral Redistribution determined that 36% of <b>the</b> <b>electorate's</b> population was urban.|$|R
5|$|Encouraged by Protestant supporters, {{including}} several in the Cathedral chapter, he declared he would retain <b>the</b> <b>electorate,</b> and in December 1582, he formally announced his conversion to the reformed {{faith and the}} parity of Calvinism with Catholicism in <b>the</b> <b>Electorate</b> and archdiocese of Cologne. The marriage with Agnes was celebrated on 4February 1583, and afterward Gebhard remained in possession of the see. This affair created a stir in the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E

5|$|The war {{had three}} phases. Initially {{it was a}} {{localized}} feud between supporters of Gebhard {{and those of the}} Catholic core of the Cathedral Chapter. With the election of Ernst of Bavaria as a competing archbishop, what had been a local conflict expanded in scale: Ernst's election guaranteed the military, diplomatic, and financial interest of the Wittelsbach family in <b>the</b> <b>Electorate</b> of Cologne's local affairs. After the deaths of Louis VI, Elector Palatine in 1583and William the Silent in 1584, the conflict shifted gears again, as the two evenly matched combatants sought outside assistance to break the stalemate. Finally, the intervention of Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, who had at his command the Spanish Army of Flanders, threw {{the balance of power in}} favor of the Catholic side. By 1588, Spanish forces had pushed Gebhard from <b>the</b> <b>Electorate.</b> In 1588 he took refuge in Strassburg, and the remaining Protestant strongholds of <b>the</b> <b>Electorate</b> fell to Parma's forces in 1589.|$|E
5|$|These {{proposals}} were rejected by <b>the</b> <b>electorate</b> of all departments {{involved with the}} exception of Arequipa. Thus, no merger was carried out.|$|E

5|$|This scheme {{can be seen}} as a {{mechanism}} for representation. First, MPs are chosen by <b>the</b> <b>electorate</b> to represent their concerns and needs in Parliament. Secondly, the Prime Minister, who is vested with the confidence of majority of the MPs, and the Cabinet which is made up of popularly elected MPs, effectively represent the views of <b>the</b> <b>electorate</b> as he heads the Government. The structure of the executive is therefore based on the concept of political representation.|$|E
5|$|As head of state, Hitler became supreme {{commander}} of the armed forces. The traditional loyalty oath of servicemen was altered to affirm loyalty to Hitler personally, by name, {{rather than to the}} office of supreme commander or the state.

5|$|Following the Acts of Union 1800, {{the royal}} arms were amended, {{dropping}} the French quartering.

5|$|Gebhard's {{conversion}} and marriage {{was the first}} major test of the principle of ecclesiastical reservation established in the Peace of Augsburg, 1555. His loss of <b>the</b> <b>Electorate</b> strengthened the Catholic counter reformation in the northern German states, gave the Jesuits a stronghold in Cologne, and expanded the Wittelsbach family influence in imperial politics.|$|E
5|$|I've had to {{deal with}} some hard truths...

But I feel it's of the greatest importance that if there's to be a Republican Party, we look these facts in the face.|$|E
