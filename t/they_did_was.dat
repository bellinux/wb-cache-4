5|$|After {{finding out}} that Arizona cheated on her with Lauren, Callie kicks Arizona out of their apartment. They also let out their true {{feelings}} about the accident and more is revealed about how they actually have felt. Callie initially agrees to couples therapy, but she {{shows up at the}} office only to tell Arizona that she isn't going in. Arizona gets drunk with April for a laugh while Callie, who is at the fundraiser, tells people that Arizona died in the plane crash. Arizona is led to believe that she and Leah slept together, however all <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> dance and make grilled cheese sandwiches after watching Derek perform surgery on film. Arizona pursues a sexual relationship with Leah but cuts ties with her when Callie asks her to come back home. It is revealed that Arizona became pregnant via a sperm donor prior to sleeping with Lauren. They decided to try again for a second child, but after agreeing that Callie would carry it, Callie went to see an OB/GYN and discovered that she had developed adhesions in her uterus since Sofia's birth, meaning she can't carry any more children. When she told Arizona, Arizona offered to carry the baby, but Callie decided that since they're still on unsteady footing that if something goes wrong, they won't make it and she doesn't want to put them in that position. They agree to postpone their plans to have another baby. However, in the season finale of Season 10 it is implied that Callie and Arizona's dream of having other child may come by means of a surrogate. At the beginning of Season 11, Callie and Arizona decide to have a baby by surrogate and Arizona applies for a fetal surgery fellowship with Dr. Herman. Arizona, with a heavy workload because of the fellowship, and Callie have an argument in the waiting room, and they choose to go to therapy together, resulting in a 30-day break. Arizona believes that the break strengthened their relationship and made her realize that she needs Callie - Callie on the other hand declares that the break gave her a taste of the freedom that she has been missing. Callie walks away and the two get a divorce later.|$|E
25|$|When they arrive, {{they find}} a trail of dead rabbits is found leading to the camp, ending with Brindleface {{in front of the}} camp, who had been killed by Tigerstar. Fireheart orders a patrol {{to get rid of the}} rabbits. Brindleface's death shocks everyone, and after her burial, the camp is {{evacuated}} to Sunningrocks to protect ThunderClan. With Bluestar still mentally unstable, it is up to Fireheart to destroy the pack and protect ThunderClan. He and the senior warriors decide that a patrol of cats will lead the dogs to and over the nearby gorge, drowning the dogs. But, before he leaves, he apologizes to Sandstorm for not obeying Bluestar and they fall in love, but all <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> realize the existing love they had for each other. The plan works: each cat successfully leads the pack closer to the gorge, breaking away from the group once they lead the dogs to a certain spot, where a fresh runner lies in wait so they can lead the dogs to the next point. Fernpaw and Ashpaw, Brindleface's kits, took part in leading the dogs; they did it as revenge against Tigerstar for killing their mother. Fireheart, the last in line, keeps a good distance between him and the pack leader, until Tigerstar appears and pins Fireheart down. As the dog leader gets dangerously close, Tigerstar leaps away, leaving Fireheart to be killed by the pack. As Fireheart struggles against the dog, Bluestar, her old self returned once more, slams into the dog, releasing its grip on Fireheart and throwing the dog —and herself— over the side of the gorge.|$|E
25|$|With {{only one}} game before the First Test Brown's men had {{to improve their}} form {{dramatically}} {{if they wanted to}} stand a chance against the powerful Australian team. Instead they conceded another first innings deficit to a weak Sheffield Shield team. the wicket-keeper-captain Don Tallon won the toss and batted and the MCC bowlers did quite well in the circumstances, Alec Bedser (3/40) and John Warr (3/70) having Queensland 23/2, but whatever good work <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> undone by slack fielding, poor catching and some new batsman making runs. Ken Archer (63), who would make his Test debut in the series added 120 with Aubrey Carrigan (100) and Ernest Toovey (58 not out) added 81 for the ninth wicket with Lawrence Chapman (38). The second day was rained off as they batted into the third day for 305. The local swing bowler Len Johnson took 6/66 in an innings of 291 that relied almost entirely on Cyril Washbrook (82) and John Dewes (117), both fighting their way back into form and jeered by the crowd as they ground out their unsightly innings. With Denis Compton making a dull 28 in 100 minutes and nobody else making 15 by the time they had finished only three overs could be bowled before stumps, but Warr picked up a wicket for no runs. The press were unsympathetic and with rumours that Hutton (damaged finger), Denis Compton (swollen knee) and Alec Bedser (influenza) were all ill or injured some wondered if the Test was worth playing. There were also the usual stories of dissension in the ranks whenever a team performs badly, which Brown hotly denied, thus providing a new story. In truth Brown ran a happy ship and allowed the team more socialising than previous captains. He also saw no reason why he should force amateur undergraduates to mix awkwardly with working class professionals, or that veterans should accompany their younger team-mates.|$|E

500|$|Even {{after the}} {{mistakes}} in the reports were discovered, {{a spokesperson for the}} U.S. National Geodetic Survey admitted the monument is placed [...] east of where modern surveyors would mark the point. However, he defended the accuracy of the original survey, stating surveyors [...] "nailed it" [...] considering the primitive tools of the day. Pointing out the achievement given the conditions, he further stated, [...] "Their ability to replicate that exact point — what <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> phenomenal, what <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> spot on." [...] He concluded by stating that any claims of errors in the location of the monument are irrelevant. Once a survey commissioned to establish a boundary has been accepted by the involved parties, the survey markers are legally binding, regardless of any error that is later discovered. Similar statements were issued by the Navajo Nation, defending their work in maintaining and promoting the monument. In addition, general U.S. land principles, law, and the Supreme Court have established that the location of the monument is the legal corner of the four states.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the local}} {{newspapers}} were quick {{to respond to the}} rebellion. An article in The Craftsman dated 2 June 1733 described the actors as [...] "malecontent Players" [...] who were busy in mutiny. On 7 June, the Grub-Street Journal stated, in an article by Musaeus, that Theophilus was selfish. Another article in the Grub-Street Journal, by Philo Dramaticus, attacked the management for not understanding how theatres are supposed to work. The managers were the first to state their defence and argued that everything <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> correct and that the actors had no reason to complain, especially over the treatment that they received.|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} 147 U.S. {{military}} personnel died in combat, and another 236 {{died as a}} result of accidents or other causes. Iraq agreed to a formal truce on March 3, and a permanent cease-fire on April 6. There was subsequent debate about whether UN Coalition forces should have driven as far as Baghdad to oust Saddam Hussein from power. Bush agreed that the decision to end the ground war when <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> correct, but the debate persisted as Hussein remained in power and rebuilt his military forces. Arguably the most significant debate concerned whether U.S. and Coalition forces had left Iraq too soon. In an April 15, 1994 interview with C-SPAN, Cheney was asked if the U.S. and UN forces should have moved into Baghdad. Cheney replied that occupying and attempting to take over the country would have been a [...] "bad idea" [...] and would have led to a [...] "quagmire", explaining that: ...|$|E

He also drew the storyboards for the episodes' openings. While episode openings in previous Ace Attorney games consisted of series of illustrations, the development team {{decided to change}} {{to make use of}} a [...] "more animated and dramatic presentation" [...] in Trials and Tribulations: by using moving graphics on top of still images, they were still able to limit the amount of data used. The first opening <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> for episode 2; it used animation a lot, and was liked by the development team, inspiring Takumi to make even better openings {{for the rest of the}} episodes and leading the team to think of movie effects that could be used.

500|$|Up to {{the point}} the episode [...] "August" [...] aired, only one {{character}} {{that was part of}} a group known as [...] "Observers" [...] had been introduced. In this episode, two more such individuals were revealed: August (played by Peter Woodward) and December (played by Eugene Lipinski). The creation of Observers {{was one of the first}} ideas the writers of Fringe thought of when developing the show in its early stages, when they asked each other, [...] "What if there were these characters where all <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> watch?". Pinkner and Wyman thought of creating Observers by [...] "looking for something... iconic" [...] that had the [...] "quality of being invisible". Though the Observer called September has appeared in every single Fringe episode in a brief cameo, he was first featured prominently in the fourth episode of the first season. The producers thought of unique characteristics for [...] "somebody who wasn't of our world," [...] evolving to the Observers having bald heads, no eyebrows, and [...] "largely deadened" [...] senses, which led to a love for extremely hot peppers.|$|E
500|$|My Bloody Valentine were {{scheduled}} to record at Blackwing Studios in Southwark, London {{for the month of}} February 1989, and intended to use the time to conceptualise a new, more studio-based sound for their second album. Shields said that Creation first believed the album could be recorded [...] "in five days". According to Shields [...] "when it became clear that wasn't going to happen, they [...] freaked." [...] After several unproductive months, the band relocated in September to the basement studio The Elephant and Wapping, where they spent eight unproductive weeks. In-house engineer Nick Robbins said Shields made it clear from the outset that he (Robbins) [...] "was just there to press the buttons." [...] Robbins was quickly replaced by Harold Burgon, but according to Shields, Burgon's main contribution was to show the group how to use the in-studio computer. Burgon and Shields spent three weeks at the Woodcray studio in Berkshire working on the Glider EP, which Shields and Creation owner Alan McGee agreed would be released in advance of the album. Alan Moulder was hired to mix the Glider song [...] "Soon" [...] at Trident 2 studio in Victoria (the song would reappear as the closing track on Loveless). Shields said of Moulder, [...] "As soon as we worked with him we realized we'd love to some more!" [...] When the group returned to work on the album Moulder was the sole engineer Shields trusted enough to perform tasks such as miking the amplifiers; all the other credited engineers were told [...] "We're so on top of this you don't even have to come to work." [...] Shields has since stated that [...] "these engineers—with the exception of Alan Moulder and later Anjali Dutt—were all just the people who came with the studio...everything we wanted to do was wrong, according to them", although the band did give credit on the album sleeve to anyone who was present during the recordings, [...] "even if all <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> fix tea", according to Shields.|$|E
