5|$|Suggesting {{the passing}} of a single day, The Loves of the Plants is divided into four cantos, all written in heroic couplets. A preface to the poem {{outlines}} the basics of the Linnaean classification system. Guiding the reader <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> is a “Botanic Muse” who is described as Linnaeus's inspiration. Interspersed between the cantos are dialogues on poetic theory between the poet and his bookseller. The poem is not a narrative; instead, reminiscent of the picaresque tradition, it consists of discrete descriptions of eighty-three separate species which are accompanied by extensive explanatory footnotes.|$|E
5|$|In 1858/59 Inselstraße was {{extended}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> to connect Köpenicker Straße {{to the city}} centre, and the Lodge was forced to sell the larger, eastern portion of the site to the city. The Köllnisches Gymnasium was then built there. How to use {{the remainder of the}} site was discussed for years; a desire to preserve the trees led to the rejection of several commercial proposals. On 15 April 1869, the Assembly of City Deputies (Stadtverordnetenversammlung) decided to establish a public playground (probably one of the first in the city) and 'promenade location' there on plans drawn up by the first city director of gardens, Gustav Meyer, dedicated the necessary funds, and urged rapid execution of the plan. The plan involved some new plantings, fencing, and benches. This renovation was completed in 1873. The park reached its current dimensions in 1883 after the ditch was filled in. Ludwig Hoffmann, the architect of the Märkisches Museum (completed in 1907), then made some changes including creating views across the park to the new museum. The last major modification of the park took place in 196971 to designs by Eberhard Jaenisch, Stefan Rauner and Roswitha Schulz: a mound which remained {{on the site of the}} bastion was levelled, a children's playground was added, a terrace was built behind the museum, and the Lapidary was created.|$|E

25|$|Among his {{favourite}} hunting-grounds was {{the affluent}} suburb of Blackheath, where {{a rash of}} burglaries was noted with alarm. It was here that Peace was finally caught. On 10 October 1878, at about 2am, a Constable Robinson saw a light appear suddenly in a window {{at the back of}} a house in St John's Park. With two colleagues, he approached the house and they rang the bell. Peace tried to escape <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden,</b> and fired four shots at Robinson, who closed on him and managed to hold him, even though a fifth shot had passed through his arm.|$|E
25|$|The {{producers}} and director James Strong paid {{particular attention to}} the visual style of the reveal. Chibnall wanted to expose the murderer's identity visually and dynamically, not through dialogue in a static scene on a set. During a location site visit prior to filming, Chibnall, Strong, and Holmes walked from the house at Lavington Close to the house on St Andrews Drive. As they crossed a footbridge over the Land Yeo, Chibnall—struck by the scenery of the area—realised that a single, uncut point of view shot of DI Hardy walking through the Miller house, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden,</b> and into the garden shed was the way to reveal the killer's identity. Chibnall and Strong decided that the shot in the first episode of Mark Latimer walking through the Broadchurch High Street should mimic this reveal shot in the eighth episode.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} day—20 January—the advanced {{elements of}} the Australian force pressed on towards Tsimba Ridge. A formation about [...] long and about [...] in height, and stretching westerly to the Genga River where a steep cliff fell to the southern bank of the river, the ridge blocked the Australian advance across the river, while its south-easternmost protrusion (later known to the Australians as the [...] "Pimple") was separated by a shallow saddle. On top of the ridge, dense jungle provided good , {{while most of the}} approaches to the ridge were open to observation. As the Australians approached the ridge, one of their platoons captured a 47mm gun positioned along the coast about [...] south of the ridge, while another platoon contacted a lone Japanese soldier, who was killed in the subsequent firefight as they entered a garden that curved along the southern approach to the ridge, and which became known as the [...] "Amphitheatre". After the initial contact, the platoon's advance <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> was prevented by an intense burst of fire from the ridge, but the Australians managed to scale the high ground that rose to their east and were able to occupy the south-eastern tip of the Pimple, capturing two 75mm guns in the process.|$|E

500|$|Protecting {{her from}} the police, Cash takes the {{journalist}} safely to her apartment, and from there, heads off to deal with Starkweather personally. Killing off several police officers, Cash then evades the SWAT teams, before making {{his way through a}} train yard, only to be cornered by more police and SWAT. They begin to beat him, and just as they're about to execute him, they are suddenly ambushed and killed by the Cerberus, who recapture Cash and bring him to Starkweather's mansion. There, they are about to kill Cash, but Piggsy—a mentally disturbed, chainsaw-wielding psychopath, who wears a pig's head as a mask and was normally kept chained up in Starkweather's attic—breaks free. This distraction allows Cash to work his way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> and mansion, killing members of the Cerberus along the way. He finally reaches the upper levels of the mansion, where he and Piggsy stalk one another. Cash triumphs after luring Piggsy onto a grate that collapses under his weight. After using Piggsy's chainsaw to hack his way through the last of the Cerberus, Cash finally confronts Starkweather in his office. Upon disemboweling him with the chainsaw, Starkweather pleads with Cash to spare him by saying [...] "Cash, I made you!", but Cash thrusts the chainsaw into his face, killing and impaling him.|$|E

2500|$|In 1832, McDonald was {{appointed}} state superintendent {{for the construction}} of the Northwestern Turnpike (present-day U.S. Route 50) through Hampshire and present-day Mineral counties under the leadership of his former West Point professor of engineering, Virginia Board of Public Works chief engineer Claudius Crozet. McDonald created many enemies in his role as superintendent due to his attunement to cost efficiency and his [...] "haughty" [...] nature. He succeeded in building the turnpike through fertile agricultural fields, as was the case of Joseph Kackley's farmland in Smokey Hollow, the most fertile field of which was lost due to both the old and new turnpike routes traversing it. McDonald also proposed building the turnpike <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> of the Clerk of the Hampshire County Court, John Baker White. White won a court appeal resulting in the rerouting of the road. This rerouting remains evident today in the curve of Main Street in Romney in front of White's residence, now known as [...] "Liberty Hall." [...] McDonald was forced from his position as superintendent and was replaced by William S. Naylor on April 5, 1834.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two stories}} are {{complementary}} and not overlapping, {{with the first}} (the Priestly story) concerned {{with the creation of}} the entire cosmos, while the second (the Yahwist story) focuses on man as cultivator of his environment and as a moral agent. There are significant parallels between the two stories, but also significant differences: the second account, in contrast to the regimented seven-day scheme of Genesis 1, uses a simple flowing narrative style that proceeds from God's forming the first man <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> of Eden {{to the creation of the}} first woman and the institution of marriage; in contrast to the omnipotent God of Genesis 1, creating a god-like humanity, the God of Genesis 2 can fail as well as succeed; the humanity he creates is not god-like, but is punished for acts which would lead to their becoming god-like (...) and the order and method of creation itself differs. [...] "Together, this combination of parallel character and contrasting profile point to the different origin of materials in [...] and , however elegantly they have now been combined." ...|$|E

2500|$|The prince-servant's first {{challenge}} begins after banquet {{during which}} the Green Emperor shows his appreciation for the precious [...] "lettuce from the garden of the bear". The Bald Man then brags about his slave's abilities in retrieving such items, and orders him to head {{off in search of}} the plant. Upon the end of this journey, his trusted stallion descends upon a lonely island, which holds a small moss-covered house belonging to the old beggar {{at the beginning of the}} story. She reveals to the prince her miraculous identity, that of [...] "Holy Sunday" [...] (Sfânta Duminică), and helps him obtain lettuce by planning a ruse: while she dulls the ferocious bear's senses with a mixture of honey and milk, Harap Alb covers himself in his father's bear skin and roams <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> in peace. The prince is again made to leave his uncle's palace once the Bald Man, envious of the Green Emperor's wealth of [...] "gems from forest of the stag", claims that his slave can obtain the deer's skull and hide, with all the precious stones that cover them. The stallion again flies his master to meet Holy Sunday, who hands him [...] "the helmet and sword of Statu-Palmă-Barbă-Cot" [...] (a dwarfish character) and subsequently accompanies him into the forest. Following her directions, Harap Alb digs a deep pit nearby at the stag's water source and place of rest, proceeds to hide there, and attacks the animal in the night, decapitating him with a chop of the blade on the neck. Also instructed to avoid the stag's [...] "poisoned eye", he again withdraws to the pit and waits there for another full day. This is the interval needed for the animal to die, during which it calls out with a human voice, attempting to lure its adversary into the reach of his poison.|$|E
2500|$|Under Sckell, {{the park}} took on its present form. [...] The only {{significant}} addition since his {{time is the}} creation of the hill for the Monopteros by his nephew Carl August Sckell, who succeeded him as director of the park. [...] In the 20th century, there were some minor additions to the park, most notably the addition in 1952 of some thirty hectares of land where the locomotive factory of Joseph Anton von Maffei had stood, and in 1958-62 of a further 67 hectares from the Hirschauer Forst (Hirschau Wood). The century almost brought less welcome changes to the park. In the Second World War, Allied bombing damaged the Monopteros and destroyed the Chinese Tower, and 93,000 cubic metres of rubble were dumped in the Hirschanger. The area was only cleared in 1953, when a sports ground for schools was created there. (The park briefly had another sports ground, with the archery range that hosted the archery competitions for the 1972 Summer Olympics on the Werneckwiese by the Kleinhesseloher See.) Transport too has harmed the character of the garden, most notably with the construction in 1963 of the Isarring, part of Munich's central ring road, which divides the park just north of the Kleinhesseloher See. [...] Towards the end of the 20th century the city of Munich wished to construct a tram route <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> north of the Chinese Tower, currently a road used only by buses; but it was opposed by the Bavarian government, which owns the land, and the Bayerische Verwaltungsgerichtshof rejected the plan. [...] There were also natural disasters: many trees were destroyed by severe storms in 1964, 1988, and 1990 (the [...] "Wiebke" [...] storm); and Dutch elm disease has almost destroyed the elm trees of the park. Both kinds of loss were compensated by a [...] "tree donation" [...] campaign organised by Munich's Abendzeitung ("Evening Paper") in 1989 to 1990 {{on the occasion of the}} park's 200th anniversary; among the 1500 new trees that were planted were a thousand elms, using only varieties resistant to Dutch elm disease.|$|E
