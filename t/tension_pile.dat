40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis concerns the behaviour of isolated piles subjected to repeated loading and placed at various depths in a medium dense sand upon which either static or cyclic surcharge acted. The piles, which were of laboratory scale, were instrumented by strain gauged load cells located along the inner surfaces of the pile shafts. The behaviour of tension as well as compression piles was examined. It {{was found that the}} behaviour of the pile was governed to a large extent by the repeated load level, the number of load cycles and the initial boundary stress conditions existing along the pile shaft. In compression, the pile life-span decreased when the embedment depth increased while the reverse trend was observed,for tension piles. The movement of both tension and compression piles decreased when the surcharge pressure was increased or was cycled, and it was of a minimum value when the upper repeated load acted in-phase with the higher surcharge pressure. For tests performed with static surcharge pressure, repeated loading was found to decrease the bearing capacity and the pulling resistance of the pile. The higher percentage of reduction was recorded for the <b>tension</b> <b>pile.</b> In contrast, after cyclic surcharge tests the pile capacity always increased. At any depth of embedment or surcharge pressure,' as the nun-her of load cycles was increased the shaft load of a compression pile increased up to a peak value then decreased gradually until it reached a limiting value. This limiting value increased when the load level, the pile depth or the surcharge pressure was increased and it was independent of the pile loading history. iii For a <b>tension</b> <b>pile</b> the shaft load decreased progressively as the number of cycles increased until failure occurred...|$|E

In accordance to the geotechnical analyses and the review on various types of foundations in the offshore engineering, the rock-embedded tension-pile may be employed as the potential foundation solution for providing the required uplift resistance to the buoyancy of SFT, especially for the steep sloping terrain at the sea/lake bed. The uplift bearing capacity of the <b>tension</b> <b>pile</b> embedded in the layered sediments is further investigated numerically, with an axisymmetric finite element model for the vertical-loading condition, and with a symmetric 3 -D finite element model for the oblique-loading one.

Some structures impose limits to the displacement of pile with a relatively small value {{in order not to}} cause damage. Therefore, it is necessary to know the behavior of pile resistance reaction against load that works in every displacement. The study was conducted using the model of single pile made of concrete with a length of 0, 2 m; 0, 3 m; 0, 4 m and each diameter 0, 02 m; 0, 03 m; 0, 04 m. The model pile is jacked in sand that has been compacted in a box and then given uplift load that refers to the ASTM D 3689 - 07 procedure E. Pile resistance reaction is shown by pile friction modulus and determined by mobilized unit shaft resistance and pile displacement relationship.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{different}} models are considered which {{can deal with}} the interaction between pile foundations and structures. This to find {{the most efficient way to}} model pile foundation structures whereby both the efficiency of the design as building process are taken into account. This are the models D-Pile (geotechnical), Scia Engineer (structural) and Plaxis (geotechnical). Therefore a study is done to the effects which play a role by pile foundation structures and or the different models can deal with this. The study focused on displacement piles which is the most used pile type in the Dutch building practice. The reference project which is used for this study is the foundation structure of a power pylon (as shown in figure 1) To get trust in the models after this study a verification is done for single piles which were subjected to an axial (compression and tension) and horizontal load on top. For piles loaded by axial compression the load-settlement behaviour is compared with the behaviour as one can determine according to NEN 9997 - 1 (EC 7). Hereby one can see that the fact that the numerical model Plaxis does not take into account the installation effects (densification and displacement of the soil around the pile) leads to a deviating load-settlement behaviour in comparison with the behaviour of the other models which are based on empirical relationship (pile tests). This behaviour can be improved by additional tricks like volume expansions of the soil around the pile, but this is not taken into account in this thesis. So therefore Plaxis was not taken into account furthermore. After the verification of single piles, the verification was expanded for pile groups which was subjected to the same loading conditions. Hereby variations were made in the centre-to-centre distances of the piles and the thickness of the cap on top. Hereby can be noticed that the fact that D-Pile cannot take into account the bending stiffness of the pile cap can lead to an unrealistic distribution of pile forces in case of a thin plate with large centre-to-centre distances of the piles. On the other hand the additional settlement of a pile group in comparison with a single pile cannot be taken into account with the chose way of modeling in Scia Engineer, but only by D-Pile. The behaviour of pile groups loaded by tension can differ significant from single piles This effect has to be taken into account manually in both models. For a horizontally loaded group there is a significant difference in results in the bending moments in the pile heads and the displacement of the pile cap, which is caused by the different horizontal springs used in the models. Combining all these knowledge leads to the conclusion that Scia Engineer seems to be the best model for the design of the foundation structure of the power pylon. Hereby both the efficiency of the design process and the structure are taken into account. The reassons for this are: 9 ̆ 5 Besides D-Foundation which is a tool to determine the bearing capacity only one model is needed to analyse the behaviour of the piles and the foundation structure. This model is also used by the structural engineer to determine the distribution of forces and the reinforcement in the structure. 9 ̆ 5 The load-displacement behaviour of (<b>tension)</b> <b>piles</b> is governed by springs which are easy to adjust and it is easy to check if the behaviour is in line with the applicable standards. This is especially the case for <b>tension</b> <b>piles,</b> for which the bearing capacity is dependent on the pile-to-pile distance and the alternation between tensile and compressive loads.

40|$|The {{complexity}} and scale of new infrastructure projects have challenged the current geotechnical design practice. Urban areas are {{growing at a}} fast pace in the horizontal and vertical direction, with taller buildings and deeper underground constructions in already densely populated areas. The West Link project in Gothenburg city {{is a good example}} of the latter. The geotechnical challenges in this project include deep excavations and deep foundations in soft sensitive natural clays. An important aspect in this case is the large buoyancy load arising from the ground water pressure, the stability of the soil mass in the excavation vicinity and the unloading heave from the soil. Typically, these loads are counterbalanced by the superstructure self-weight and by bedrock anchors. The very deep clay deposits in Gothenburg, however, require traditional floating piles to sustain the permanent tension loads from these processes. Little is known about the long-term behaviour of pile foundations in deep soft soil deposits under permanent tension loads. The need for a reliable foundation system for the West Link tunnel and the limited data available on permanently loaded <b>tension</b> <b>piles</b> in soft clays motivates further theoretical and experimental investigation of this pile type in natural soft structured clays. As a result this Thesis presents new findings on the long-term behaviour of <b>tension</b> loaded <b>piles</b> in natural soft structured clays. The unique results from the field tests on six pile elements incorporate all significant stages in the pile cycle, i. e. pile installation, set-up and long-term loading, yet are sufficiently short to link the pile response to the soil behaviour of one particular layer. Furthermore, a novel cost-effective loading rig using gas springs and remote logging based on open-source software and freely available cloud storage is developed for execution of the field tests. The results indicate that the measured long-term bearing capacity is smaller than the short-term reference capacity. The difference is in the order of 20 – 30 % smaller. This reduction is attributed to the on-going creep deformations in the soil surrounding the pile shaft. These deformations cause relaxation of the effective stresses due to the kinematic constrains at the pile-soil interface. In addition to an analytical system level interpretation of the measured pile head displacement that showed only benign maximum final pile head displacements after 100 years, an advanced numerical analysis that incorporates a state-of-the-art rate dependent soft soil model is performed. The measured data and simulation results are in good agreement and corroborate previous investigations, however, for the first time the physical mechanisms underpinning the measured response are generalised and tertiary creep failure is reproduced. The long-term pile response is directly related to the behaviour of the soil adjacent to the pile shaft. Further work should focus on the evolution of the stress field and soil properties under long-term pile loading. Deviatoric creep deformations should be studied in more detail by means of element level laboratory test on natural and remoulded soft clays...|$|R
40|$|Five pile {{tests have}} been performed, {{at the west}} coast of Mexico, in order to {{evaluate}} their pile bearing capacity. The Kentledge system (a test pile loaded in between two <b>tension</b> <b>piles)</b> has been used to execute the pile tests. The soil stratigraphy has been surveyed with standard penetration tests, cone penetration tests and borings, and consists of a ten to twelve meter soft clayey soil on top of a hard clay layer. Three identical pile tests have been performed on bored piles with a pile diameter of 0. 6 m and a pile length of 30 m. In addition, two identical pile tests have been performed on driven piles with a squared cross section of 0. 5 m × 0. 5 m and a pile length of about 21 m. The aims of these tests were, first to evaluate the pile bearing capacity for both the bored and the driven pile types, in order to decide which pile type will be used finally, for the foundation of a factory; and second, to study the influence of the pile installation process on the pile bearing capacity of both pile types. During the testing of the bored piles, load measurements in different sections of the pile suggested that almost all bearing capacity came from the pile section in the upper soft clay layer. Since it is impossible to have such a relative large friction along the pile shaft in the soft soil, and because far more concrete was used for making the pile than expected, it had to be concluded that the liquid concrete has widened the pile diameter just above the hard soil layer, leading to a bulking effect in the pile. Therefore, the pile was leaning on this hard soil layer. For the driven test piles, the measurements showed a normal behaviour of both the pile shaft friction and the pile tip bearing capacity...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{behaviour}} of micropiles under axial tensile loading and modelling of the pile head displacement of micropiles. In the behaviour of micropiles, defined in load and corresponding pile head displacement, {{the development of the}} shear stress along the pile shaft is found to be of leading influence. This development of the shear stresses determines not only the lengthening of the pile during the whole loading process, but also the displacement of the pile tip. Due to the compressibility of the slender foundation pile the shear stress acting at the pile tip will only develop with high loads on top. Also a closer look is given to the pile stiffness. The contribution of the grout to the pile stiffness is found to be only of small influence on the pile head displacement and corresponding axial spring stiffness. However it is found that the crack width in the grout due to the tension load on top is relatively big and this might give problems with corrosion. The model to calculate the pile head displacement and correspond axial spring stiffness of the micropile developed in this thesis is called the Revised FOREVER model. It is based on the current Dutch method to determine shear stresses and maximum bearing capacity. The development of the shear stresses and displacement along the pile shaft is modelled using load transfer curves. Because the soil stress-strain relation is assumed to behave linear elastic-perfectly plastic along the pile shaft, the calculations can be done analytically. Due to a scaling factor which implements pile stiffness, shaft area, soil behaviour and bond length the model can be adapted different local situations. The model is compared with measurements from field tests and with other numerical models and the results correspondence with each other. Due to the scaling factor implementing all local parameters it was possible to simplify the calculation method. Therefore the Simplified Revised FOREVER model is developed. This is based on the current Dutch calculation method to determine the axial spring stiffness of <b>tension</b> <b>piles.</b> Geo-engineeringGeoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Among the various ground-improvement methods available for overcoming these undesirable characteristics, geosynthetic-reinforced pile-supported (GRPS) embankments {{are considered to be}} a reliable solution suitable for time-bound construction projects and difficult ground conditions. Various researchers have introduced methods to design GRPS embankments based on different load transfer mechanisms. However, among design engineers, there is uncertainty regarding the applicability of these design methods. This paper investigates the load transfer mechanism of GRPS embankments using two-dimensional and three-dimensional finite element analyses, and currently available design methods are compared with the results of the finite element modelling. A comparison of the design methods was carried out using the stress reduction ratio, the geosynthetic <b>tension</b> and <b>pile</b> efficacy, considering different pile diameters and spacing, and embankment heights, which govern the currently available design methods.

40|$|Improved {{infrastructure}} {{in urban areas}} often necessitates underground construction, where the unloading behaviour of the soil is of importance for predicting the amount of heave {{and how long it}} will take for the soil to swell. It is of particular interest to study the need for the installation of <b>tension</b> <b>piles,</b> as well as whether the tunnel will be subjected to settlement or heave in the long term. The objective of this study was to investigate the unloading behaviour of soft clay, and thereby reducing the uncertainties associated with this type of construction in future projects. This paper focuses on the unloading modulus of soft clay and includes results from a field and laboratory study. Previous studies on the unloading of clay have mainly employed laboratory methods to determine the unloading modulus, and these results are compared with the results of this project. The field study was conducted at an excavation for the Götaleden tunnel in Gothenburg. Extensive measurements of heave and pore pressures were performed at the construction site during a period of over one year. Several piezometers, earth pressure cells measuring total pressure and pore pressure, heave gauges and extensometers were installed at the centre of the excavation. The results were analysed and the unloading modulus was estimated from the measurements. The laboratory tests mainly consisted of incrementally loaded oedometer tests and drained triaxial extension tests. Bender elements were used in the triaxial apparatus to measure the initial soil stiffness. The results show a very high initial stiffness, which corresponds well with field measurements (Andréasson, 1979). The laboratory test results reveal that it is possible to capture the small strain behaviour in the clay, using advanced triaxial test equipment and measurement techniques. However, results from the field study indicate a noticeably stiffer behaviour, than ordinary laboratory tests. Differences in the results were expected due to the difficulty of recreating the in-situ characteristics of the clay specimen in the laboratory. Proposed curves for the variation of the unloading modulus with stress level are presented for normally to slightly overconsolidated clays. The study shows that the unloading modulus has a large initial value, which drops considerably with the decrease in stress. The creep in the clay prior to unloading is a factor that has a major influence on the initial stiffness. The field results indicate an initial stiffness three times greater than that observed in the Bender element tests, which is likely to be an effect of creep or stress path rotation. In the excavation at hand, the heave process seems to have terminated within three months of completion of the excavation, coinciding with the time at which steady state pore pressures were reached, which was considerably faster than originally expected...|$|R

40|$|The {{excavated}} building pit is a {{frequently used}} building technique during {{the construction of}} structures below ground level. A temporary structure of sheet piles and underwater concrete is designed to retain soil and water. Ribbed <b>tension</b> <b>piles</b> are driven to compensate the hydrostatic pressure after de-watering of the construction pit. Generally, {{the top of the}} foundation piles are crushed before concreting the structural. The uncovered pile reinforcement is combined with the slab reinforcement which results in a monolithic floor with an optimal connection between slab and pile. During some construction projects it is desirable to avoid pile head crushing for economic reasons or to prevent the stray current phenomena. The question that arises is to what extend does the partly penetrated ribbed foundation pile influence the punching shear behaviour of the structural slab when the pile is loaded in compression during the exploitation phase. At the heart of this debate lies the problem of the effectiveness of the present ribs and the associated punching cone perimeter. In order to investigate the punching shear behaviour, simulations by nonlinear finite element analyses have been performed using the software ATENA developed by Cervenka Consulting. Initially, conducted experiments were simulated in order to validate the modelling technique. The contact area is modelled with interface material, based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion for shear planes. The FEM analyses showed good agreement with the conducted experiments regarding to crack propagation which induces punching shear. The case study is made up of a number of subsequent modelling steps to investigate each influence separately. The case study starts with a parameter study to investigate the influence of the shear transfer capacity from slab to pile on the punching behaviour. The maximum allowable shear stress depends of a cohesion parameter and a coefficient of friction parameter. Various combinations of both parameters are investigated with respect to the punching shear behaviour. A clear distinction in failure behaviour is observed between a friction coefficient of 1. 0 and 1. 4. Up to a friction coefficient of 1. 0, the critical shear crack propagates from pile head towards the slab surface which indicates that only the top part of the slab is responsible for punching shear resistance. From a friction coefficient of 1. 4 the critical shear crack propagates from slab bottom towards slab surface, which indicates that the full slab height is active in punching resistance. This change in punching cone size results in a failure load which is more than twice as high. No significant increase of failure load is observed during analyses with different cohesion values. The second step consists of adding reinforcement to the initial model. The influence of bending reinforcement was neglectable due to the limited slab deflections. However, the influence of shear reinforcement was significant. For friction coefficients from 0. 0 to 1. 0, the failure load increased with a magnitude of roughly four compared to the failure load without shear reinforcement. An increase of roughly two is observed for friction coefficients of 1. 4 or greater. Also a change in failure behaviour is observed. For friction coefficients of 1. 0 or greater, the brittle punching behaviour changes into ductile flexural behaviour. This is highly desirable because large structural deflections insinuates an upcoming failure. Although full scale laboratory tests are needed to verify the numerical results, the recommendation for practical use is that for structural slabs provided with shear reinforcement and a foundation pile with at least two ribbed sides, a fully punching cone develops.

40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the general problem of existing foundation of civil infrastructure in the Netherlands that is generally {{not included in the}} maintenance management cycle. This can lead in some cases to highly undesirable situations where {{a lot of time and}} money must be spent in order to provide a safe and available infrastructure facility again. The objective of this research is to determine whether the current situation of maintenance management of infrastructure facilities in the Netherlands can be optimized by balancing the performance, risk and cost. This is done by investigating whether specific maintenance management to the foundation of an infrastructure facility can contribute to this objective. This leads to the following research question: “Which kind of specific maintenance management focused on the infrastructure’s foundation can optimize the balance between performance, risk and cost?” This research is divided into two parts, the first part is a theoretical background research where the essential items of the optimization problem are outlined and an analysis, based on literature, performed on three real life cases. In the second part; the practical case study, the theoretical analysis is compared to the actual maintenance history of the cases. This evaluation compares the theoretically optimal maintenance strategy against the applied one. In the practical study also the occurred failure of the foundation is analysed where the main cause of the incident is studied. In this way the optimization obtained can be validated through the assessment of potential difference in the optimal and applied strategy. To answer the main research question first the individual research components are investigated. Performance can be described as the quality-level of functioning of a specific system or sub-system. A high required performance demands in general a higher level of maintenance management and the required performance of a facility differs per infrastructure facility. A risk is the chance of an undesirable event happening and can be expressed in the chance of occurrence multiplied with its consequence. Determining the maintenance management risk-based can be used to select cost effective and appropriate maintenance tasks and techniques. Maintenance involves costs. Currently there are many old and deteriorating objects in the Netherlands that should be maintained for the coming decades. The budget for these maintenance activities are decided upon in political surroundings. The specific maintenance management able to optimize the balance between performance, risk and cost, is interpreted as the maintenance management strategy. This strategy describes the physical nature of the maintenance activities. As optimization of this balance between performance, risk and cost is not a given fact, the balance between the three research criteria is assessed; when performance is maximized, and thus in general risks minimized, the costs are automatically maximized as a higher level of quality maintenance management and monitoring is more expensive. When the costs are minimized, the quality of the performance will be lower and the risk of failure higher. The main research question can be translated to the choice of the maintenance management strategy that is optimal considering the three balanced components. Within this research three case studies are used to determine this optimal balance and thus the kind of maintenance management suited for infrastructure foundation. As infrastructure foundation beholds many different physical forms not all infrastructure foundation can be seen as one and the same. But the analysed failures and consequences can be recognized for a larger domain as the cases have a decomposition of general components that civil infrastructure foundation consists of. In this research the attained domain are the three case studies used, whereas the intended domain is infrastructure foundation that has physiological similarities with the attained domain; sunken tunnel types with access ramps founded on <b>tension</b> <b>piles,</b> viaducts and bridges founded on a concrete pile foundation. In detail the research shows that the optimal maintenance strategy to be used for the intended infrastructure foundation would be preventive of nature, in contrast to the current situation where only a corrective strategy is applied. The research shows that the optimal balance is to mitigate the socially unacceptable risks by preventive tasks and monitoring actions in order to prevent and/ or monitor failure. The level of prevention of these tasks and actions are initially determined by the availability of data. Thus a significant aspect of attention is the importance of object data availability.

40|$|Velvet is {{a luxury}} cloth. Fashioned into garments, it dresses the elite. In interiors, it covers walls and upholsters furniture. Its sumptuous display denotes status, power, {{privilege}} and wealth. For the past twenty-eight years, my research and art has focused on learning its traditions and handweaving practice. Besides studying textile archives, I have more importantly visited the few remaining ateliers and have interviewed the artisans to learned about their training, methods and activities. How do they control the <b>tension</b> of the <b>pile</b> warp?How do they prevent crushing the woven velvet while {{it is on the}} loom?How do they cut the pile loops?How do they control the pattern and design?How does the choice of ground weave effect the cloth?How were they trained and how do they train? My research has taken me to seven countries (Italy, France, England, Japan, China, Turkey and Uzbekistan) where I have found 16 ateliers that still weave velvet. About thirty-five silk velvet weavers remain. My quest started at the Foundation Lisio in Florence, Italy where I worked with Vittorio Rettori on manual Jacquard handlooms. Other Italian ateliers are Gaggioli and Cordani in Zoagli, and Rubelli and Bevilacqua in Venice. In Lyon, France are Agnes Alauzet of the Maison des Canuts, Prelle and Tassanari et Chatel; in England, only Richard John Humphries; in Japan Kunikazu Ito and Eikichi Higuchi; in China, the Suzhou Silk Museum; in Turkey the Dokuma Fabrikasi; and in Uzbekistan, Rasuljon Mirzaahmedov and Fazlitdin Dadajonov make ikat velvet...|$|R
40|$|The data {{measured}} {{in this study}} suggest that the increase in compressive pile capacity for a 42 -ft long, HP 14 x 102 pile, in a predominantly fine-grained Missouri River alluvium soil profile, increases by about 16 percent from days seven to forty-four after driving. It appears evident that Davisson’s (1973) failure criteria seems to agree fairly well with the observed plunging failure of two compressive pile-load failure tests performed in Missouri River alluvium. By comparison of compressive proof and failure tests performed on day forty-four after driving, it appears that loading a pile to some degree prior to failure, and then reloading the pile, has almost no affect on the load-settlement relationship. Hence, proof loaded piles in Missouri River alluvium that pass should be allowed for use beneath the structure. Finally, comparisons of <b>tension</b> and compression <b>pile</b> load test data have lead to two possible conclusions. First, the estimation of tip load by tell-tale data may not be accurate, and may underestimate the amount of load actually transferred to the tip. And second, it seems viable that, at this site, the skin friction that can be counted on in design is perhaps 55 to 60 percent of that calculated for compression. INTRODUCTION The majority of the closure structures at this job site will be founded on deep foundations requiring the installation of a significant number of driven piles. It is of the utmost importance to establish a safe and economical pile design t...|$|R
40|$|A direct CPTu {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{for determining the}} capacity of an axially loaded pile. The method employs all of the CPTu data with the cone point resistance, qc, as the primary measurement. The sleeve friction, fs, which is an imprecise measurement, is limited to use {{in combination with the}} effective cone resistance, qE (cone point resistance adjusted to effective stress by deducting the measured pore pressure) to interpret the soil according to a classification chart, developed as a part of this dissertation. Both the pile unit toe and shaft resistances are functions of the CPTu effective cone resistance, with the toe and shaft correlation coefficients, Ct and Cs, respectively. A database consisting of 192 case histories was compiled to calibrate and develop an improved CPT direct method, and to reference to the current CPT direct methods for pile capacity calculation. The case histories contain results of full-scale pile loading tests, soil characteristics, and CPT soundings which were performed close to the pile locations. The proposed method relates both the pile unit toe resistance and the unit shaft resistance to the effective cone point resistance, qE. The hypothesis for the study was explored that both toe and shaft resistances are proportional to the effective cone resistance and can be determined by assigning a correlation factor to qE. Twenty-four pile case histories have been compiled including static loading tests performed in uplift, or in push with separation of shaft and toe resistances at sites which comprise CPT soundings. These case histories are used to calibrate the two formulae for estimation of pile toe and shaft resistances from CPTu data. As a result of the calibration based on 24 pile case histories with separate measurement of pile toe and shaft capacities, for pile unit toe resistance, a simple mathematical rule is used to relate the cone resistance to the pile unit toe resistance in a one-to-one relationship. Five CPT direct methods currently used in North American practice have been investigated to reference the proposed method. The five CPT direct methods are: The Schmertmann method, the European Method, the French method, the Meyerhof method, and the Tumay method. The results of estimated pile capacity from the proposed method and the other methods were compared to the measured pile capacity for 142 case records compiled in the database. It was verified that the main factors that cause significant error in pile capacity estimation by the current methods are: smoothing the CPT data, development based on mechanical cone data, employing undrained shear strength, Su, imposing an upper limit to the pile unit toe and shaft resistances, not including all CPT measurement, considerable difference between the correlation factors for steel and concrete piles, considerable difference between the correlation factors for <b>tension</b> and compression <b>piles,</b> disregard of factors such as soil sensitivity, dilatancy effects, and effective stress.
