5|$|The postcards used to {{introduce}} a country and their participants were shot in their respective countries and featured the artists using unique ways to create their country's flag, e.g. <b>the</b> <b>postcard</b> for the United Kingdom features Molly creating the Union Flag from AEC Routemaster buses, Royal Mail vans, and people wearing blue raincoats along with strips of red and white paper, and <b>the</b> <b>postcard</b> for Denmark featuring Basim and his singers using old furniture and red and white paint to paint the Danish flag. The postcards then ended with the act taking a picture on a camera or phone and a close up of the resulting artwork was shown onscreen. The flag created by the artist(s) is then captured into a diamond and it transitions to the official flag. It then swirls round for the before-hand details of the artist/composer. For example, the entry for San Marino features the painting of the flag that Valentina Monetta (the artist) created, transitioning into the official flag for San Marino.|$|E
5|$|As a point-and-click {{adventure}} game, {{the player}} controls Simon using the mouse. The iOS and Android versions feature touch-screen controls. Gameplay involves moving Simon around and interacting with objects and other characters. The player can make Simon perform actions such as giving an item to another character, talk to another character, {{and pick up}} (add to inventory), examine, use, move, consume, wear, or open or close an item. Some actions are binary: they involve two objects and the player sometimes, after telling Simon to use an item, needs to specify what to use it with. A map that enables Simon to instantly transport to a major landmark (if it has been discovered) is provided. <b>The</b> <b>postcard</b> is used to load, save, or quit the game.|$|E

25|$|The film {{opens in}} modern Stockholm. Orphaned by his mother's death and father's disappearance, Bosse (Nicholas Pickard) suffers neglect by his guardians Aunt Edna (Gunilla Nyroos) and Uncle Sixten, {{as well as}} abuse from bullies. His best friend is Benke (Christian Bale), whose father Bosse envies. Running away one night to seek his own father, Bosse meets the kindly shopkeeper Mrs Lundin (Linn Stokke), who gives him an apple and asks him to mail a postcard. <b>The</b> <b>postcard</b> is {{addressed}} to the Land of Faraway, informing its King of Bosse's impending journey there. After Bosse mails <b>the</b> <b>postcard,</b> his apple turns golden. Dropping the transfigured apple in shock, Bosse stumbles upon a genie (Geoffrey Staines) trapped in a bottle and frees it.|$|E

25|$|Even the Nazis did not {{stoop to}} selling souvenirs of Auschwitz, but lynching scenes became a burgeoning subdepartment of <b>the</b> <b>postcard</b> industry. By 1908, the trade {{had grown so}} large, and the {{practice}} of sending postcards featuring the victims of mob murderers had become so repugnant, that the U.S. Postmaster General banned the cards from the mails.|$|E
25|$|On September 15, 1954, the 2-cent Jefferson stamp {{from the}} Liberty Issue was issued in San Francisco, California. <b>The</b> <b>postcard</b> rate went to 2 {{cents on the}} day of this issue was {{released}} so the stamp was very common among the mail for that reason.

25|$|Another form of {{collecting}} regards postcards, a document {{written on a}} single robust sheet of paper, usually decorated with photographic pictures or artistic drawings {{on one of the}} sides, and short messages on {{a small part of the}} other side, that also contained the space for the address. In strict philatelic usage, <b>the</b> <b>postcard</b> is to be distinguished from the postal card, which has a pre-printed postage on the card. The fact that this communication is visible by other than the receiver often causes the messages to be written in jargon.|$|E

The trip continued for two weeks, crossing mountains and rivers on foot and by boat. Manser slept on a hammock while his friend slept on the ground. On 18 May, they reached the Sarawak/Kalimantan border, spending their final night there. Manser asked his friend to carry a postcard back to his girlfriend in Switzerland. According to his friend, Manser looked healthy when they parted ways. Manser complained about diarrhoea and a broken rib in <b>the</b> <b>postcard.</b>|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the episode, each contestant were given a bag of trinkets including postcards depicting Miami, Tahiti, and St. Tropez. Elizabeth, Erik and Matt got the Miami postcard, Andrea, Felicia and Michael got the Tahiti postcard, and Carisa, Goil and Ryan got the St. Tropez postcard. Their mission was to build a cabana inspired by <b>the</b> <b>postcard</b> in 16 hours, with resources from Pier One Imports only. Since Erik won the last competition, he could not be eliminated during this challenge. This worried Matt, as he could be eliminated a lot easier being on a team with only two viable targets as opposed to three.|$|E
25|$|The $1.30 Graf Zeppelin stamp {{was first}} issued in Washington DC on April 19, 1930. The stamp was printed in brown and depicts the Graf Zeppelin flying westward, {{superimposed}} over {{a map of}} the continents of Europe and South and North America with the names of various cities depicted in it. This issue paid <b>the</b> <b>postcard</b> and letter rates on the May 1930 Pan American flight that departed from Germany, flying to Brazil and then the United States. Postage rates depended on the distance between points along the route. The Scotts catalog number for this issue is C14.

500|$|Scotland Yard {{published}} facsimiles of the [...] "Dear Boss" [...] {{letter and}} <b>the</b> <b>postcard</b> on , in the ultimately vain hope {{that someone would}} recognise the handwriting. Charles Warren explained {{in a letter to}} Godfrey Lushington, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department: [...] "I think the whole thing a hoax but of course we are bound to try & ascertain the writer in any case." [...] On [...] 1888, George R. Sims in the Sunday newspaper Referee implied scathingly that the letter was written by a journalist [...] "to hurl the circulation of a newspaper sky high". Police officials later claimed to have identified a specific journalist as the author of both the [...] "Dear Boss" [...] letter and <b>the</b> <b>postcard.</b> The journalist was identified as Tom Bullen in a letter from Chief Inspector John Littlechild to George R. Sims dated [...] 1913. A journalist called Fred Best reportedly confessed in 1931 that he and a colleague at The Star had written the letters signed [...] "Jack the Ripper" [...] to heighten interest in the murders and [...] "keep the business alive".|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} the artwork was finalized, Duane Allman was still alive and the title had not been finalized.

Powell later said, [...] "When we showed it to someone at the label, he said, 'They are so hot right now, we could sell it in a brown paper bag'". Atlantic initially intended to title the album The Kind We Grow in Dixie, but the band refused. The title was the label of <b>the</b> <b>postcard</b> series Powell had seen in Athens.

500|$|While {{still at}} EC, Kurtzman had overseen {{the first five}} Mad pocket books {{published}} by Ballantine Books, which became perennial sellers with sales in the millions. [...] When Kurtzman left EC, his royalties from the books ceased and Gaines had Kurtzman's name removed from them. [...] In 1958 Gaines abandoned Ballantine for Signet Books. [...] Kurtzman proposed an original paperback to Ian Ballantine, who {{was looking for something}} to replace the Mad line. [...] Kurtzman was well respected at the Ballantine offices, and it was editor Bernard Shir-Cliff who provided Kurtzman with <b>the</b> <b>postcard</b> of the gap-toothed character that was to become Mads mascot AlfredE. Neuman. [...] Ballantine had earlier published The Humbug Digest in the same format with material culled from Kurtzman's Humbug magazine, though it fared poorly in the market.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>postcards</b> used to {{introduce}} each competing nation {{during the show}} were built around the concept of selfies. <b>The</b> <b>postcards</b> featured <b>the</b> competing artists sending their selfie {{to a group of}} three teenagers in Bulgaria, which would then inspire their adventures.

500|$|SVT {{confirmed}} on 19 February 2013 that <b>the</b> <b>postcard</b> films, used {{to introduce}} each {{song in the}} contest, would feature each artist in their respective country, to give the viewer a personal insight of each competing participant. This broke with recent tradition of the postcards often containing short segments of life within either the host city or country of the contest. They were produced by a company called Camp David. [...] The on-air graphics were produced by Broken Doll, a production company. The animation of the many butterflies {{was done by the}} visual effects studio Swiss International. For example, Sweden's postcard features Robin and his friends at a funfair, having fun and meeting fans, while Ireland's postcard shows Ryan together with his family. [...] In addition to the graphic design, there was a theme music for the contest entitled [...] "Wolverine" [...] composed by Adam Kafe, which was used in the intros and in-between commercial breaks.|$|E
500|$|As <b>the</b> <b>postcard</b> {{effort was}} {{reaching}} its peak, tabloid newspapers {{speculated that the}} Labour Party wanted to put Hewson up for the Irish presidential election of 2004, with the Daily Mirror quoting an unnamed party insider as saying, [...] "She's a mother of four but she has always had world issues at heart and she'd make the perfect candidate." [...] (Labour had succeeded with its candidate Mary Robinson in the 1990 election but came in fourth with Roche in the 1997 election.) Hewson stated {{that she had not}} been approached, and that [...] "It's not a serious proposition. It would obviously be a huge honour if I was asked to take on such a huge task, but for one thing I'm not sure I'm qualified, and for another I've got four small kids to bring up first." [...] She also expressed contentment with incumbent President Mary McAleese staying for another term. She jokingly added that she could not see Bono agreeing to live in a smaller house. Hewson received a media mention two years later as a possible Social Democratic and Labour Party candidate in the 2004 European Parliament elections after John Hume had stood down. [...] The notion of her running for Irish president came up again in 2008 in conjunction with the 2011 election; columnist Fiona Looney wrote in the Daily Mail that while [...] "she is certainly a decent and smart woman", the position was better held by someone with a stronger background and more diplomatic experience. Hewson demurred once more, saying she did not speak the Irish language well enough, this time adding humorously that she could not see her husband being willing to walk behind her at events. The candidate that Labour did put up, Michael D. Higgins, won the post. Notwithstanding this speculation, Hewson generally shies away from political comments in the media.|$|E
