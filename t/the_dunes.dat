5|$|Half {{the area}} of the salt marshes that formed in the lee of Scolt Head Island has been {{reclaimed}} in the last 300 years, creating ecologically important, but very fragile, grazing marshes. Although Holkham is low-lying and can flood in severe weather conditions, it is protected by the spit that developed at the Holkham Gap in the 1990s and <b>the</b> <b>dunes</b> along the coast, which are increasingly being stabilised by vegetation. The Environment Agency's management plan until 2105 is to rely on the natural protection of <b>the</b> <b>dunes,</b> intervening only if work is necessary to maintain their effectiveness {{in the face of a}} potential sea level rise of 1.1m (3ft) by that date. The shingle that makes up Scolt Head Island is moving westwards and southwards at up to 3.5m (10ft) per year. This may affect the movement of sediment, and lead to some erosion of <b>the</b> <b>dunes</b> and beaches at Holkham, but should not destroy their effectiveness as a sea defence unless the island reattaches to the mainland at some date in the distant future.|$|E

40|$|The Lower Victoria Valley {{is one of}} the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, and has {{the largest}} {{concentration}} of aeolian sand <b>dunes</b> on <b>the</b> continent. Aeolian bedforms include elongate slipfaceless dunes which have been called ‘whaleback’ dunes. These dunes are composed of coarse sand and capped by granule ripples. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) profiles across one of these dunes reveal low-angle inclined sigmoid/tangential and convex reflections that are interpreted as strata within <b>the</b> <b>dune.</b> These dipping strata record the migration of <b>the</b> whaleback <b>dune</b> and show that they are not sand mantles as previously described but are actively migrating, long-wavelength, low-amplitude bedforms resembling zibar. An 800 m profile along the axis of <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> reveals low-angle dips from west to east showing that <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> has accreted towards the east. GPR profiles collected at 100 m intervals transverse to <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> axis reveal sets of cross-stratification dipping towards the south at the eastern end of <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> and towards <b>the</b> north at its western end. These apparent dips are resolved to show that <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> has migrated from west to east, driven by westerly foehn winds and katabatic winds blowing from the Polar ice cap, whilst {{at the same time it}} has been building obliquely towards the south. Accretion towards the north at the western end of <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> is attributed to reworking of <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> sand by easterly winds blowing inland from McMurdo Sound. An unconformity within <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> suggests that <b>the</b> wind regime has varied in the past. Beneath the unconformity <b>the</b> direction of <b>dune</b> migration was from west to east, and eastward extension of <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> continues at <b>the</b> present day. However, this is combined with accretion towards the north and west at the western end of <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> which is not recorded in the older sediments beneath the unconformity. Sand wedge structures that may have taken hundreds to thousands of years to form are found within <b>the</b> <b>dune,</b> and suggest that arid conditions suitable for dune construction have persisted in Victoria Valley for a considerable time...|$|R
5|$|The Little Tern colony at Holkham, holding seven {{per cent}} of the British population, is cordoned off in the {{breeding}} season, with signs explaining why people are excluded from the area. The dune vegetation can be damaged by too many people walking over it, leading to blowout, the rapid wind erosion of the sand. Boardwalks and steps enable visitors to reach the beach on foot without harming <b>the</b> <b>dunes,</b> and horse riders and naturists are asked {{to stay on the}} beach and keep off <b>the</b> <b>dunes.</b> As the climate becomes warmer in the future, there is likely to be more tourism pressure on the coasts, but the effects of this may be mitigated by a move towards lower-impact activities like bathing.|$|E
5|$|The {{longitudinal}} (or linear) dunes {{were initially}} {{presumed to be}} formed by moderately variable winds that either follow one mean direction or alternate between two different directions. Subsequent observations indicate that <b>the</b> <b>dunes</b> point to the east although climate simulations indicate Titan's surface winds blow toward the west. At less than 1 meter per second, they are not powerful enough to lift and transport surface material. Recent computer simulations indicate that <b>the</b> <b>dunes</b> {{may be the result}} of rare storm winds that happen only every fifteen years when Titan is in equinox. These storms produce strong downdrafts, flowing eastward at up to 10 meters per second when they reach the surface.|$|E

5|$|Annie Jane, a three-masted {{immigrant}} {{ship out}} of Liverpool bound for Montreal, Canada, struck rocks off the West Beach of Vatersay during a storm on Tuesday 28 September, 1853.

5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass have an {{important}} function in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and grey hair-grass help to bind the sand. Sea holly, sand sedge, bird's-foot trefoil and pyramidal orchid are other specialists of this arid habitat. Some specialised mosses and lichens are found on <b>the</b> <b>dunes,</b> and help to consolidate the sand; a survey in September 2009 found 41 lichen species. The plant distribution {{is influenced by the}} dunes' age as well as their moisture content, the deposits becoming less alkaline as calcium carbonate from animal shells is leached out of the sand to be replaced by more acidic humus from plant decomposition products. Marram grass is particularly discouraged by the change in acidity. A similar pattern is seen with mosses and lichens, with the various areas of <b>the</b> <b>dunes</b> containing different species according to the acidity of the sand. At least four moss species have been identified as important in dune stabilization, since they help to consolidate the sand, add nutrients as they decompose, and pave the way for more exacting plant species. The moss and lichen flora of Blakeney Point differs markedly from that of lime-rich dunes on the western coasts of the UK. Non-native tree lupins have become established near the Lifeboat House, where they now grow wild.|$|E
50|$|The sand mass of dunes {{can move}} either {{windward}} or leeward, depending on {{if the wind}} is making contact with <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> from below or above its apogee. If wind hits from above, the sand particles move leeward. If sand hits from below, sand particles move windward. The leeward flux of sand {{is greater than the}} windward flux. Further, when the wind carrying sand particles when it hits <b>the</b> <b>dune,</b> <b>the</b> <b>dune’s</b> sand particles will saltate more than if the wind had hit <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> without carrying sand particles.|$|R

40|$|Extreme storms drive {{change in}} coastal areas, {{including}} destruction of dune systems that protect coastal populations. Data from four extreme storms impacting four geomorphically diverse barrier islands {{are used to}} quantify dune elevation change. This change is compared to storm characteristics to identify variability in dune response, improve understanding of morphological interactions, and provide estimates of scaling parameters applicable for future prediction. Locations where total water levels did not exceed <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> crest experienced elevation change of less than 10 %. Regions where wave-induced water levels exceeded <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> crest exhibited a positive linear relationship between the height of water over <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> and <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> elevation change. In contrast, a negative relationship was observed when surge exceeded <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> crest. Results indicate that maximum dune elevation, and therefore future vulnerability, may be more impacted from lower total water levels where waves drive sediment over <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> rather than surge-dominated flooding events...|$|R
5|$|The {{granitic}} gneiss rocks {{throughout the}} entire coastline are home to large populations of invertebrates, fish and seaweed. These gneiss and <b>the</b> <b>dunes</b> form rich ecosystems, but are threatened by waterfront construction, holiday-makers and dune sports. Short-beaked common dolphins occur in large numbers in Northern Portugal. Dolphins show themselves by porpoising and bowriding along with boats just off the city of Póvoa de Varzim, where fishing activities occur. Alive or dead discarded fish while fishing can be easily caught by dolphins, which could help explain this relationship in the city's waters. Stranded whales and dolphins and found dead occur with some frequency, natural causes, rough seas events, incidents with ships or fishing boats can explain these events.|$|E
5|$|The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, comma, hummingbird hawk-moth, broad-bordered bee hawk-moth and {{ghost moth}} are {{sometimes}} {{seen in the}} woods with the common butterfly and moth species, and a clouded yellow or Camberwell beauty may also occur in some years. Grayling, small heath and common blue butterflies can be found in <b>the</b> <b>dunes,</b> where there is also a large antlion colony, making Holkham one of only two locations for this predatory insect in the UK. Dragonflies include the migrant hawker, southern hawker and ruddy darter.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} ultimately stayed {{far away}} from the coast, and the heavy rainfall and thunderstorms remained at least 50miles (85km) offshore. While nearly stationary, Hurricane Ella produced waves of 5 to 9feet (2 to 3metres) in height, as well as rip currents along the coast. The highest wind gust from the storm over land was 31mph (50km/h) at Diamond Shoal Light. The waves reached <b>the</b> <b>dunes</b> along most beaches, causing some minor beach erosion; the depleted sand returned within a few days. Further north, along the coast of Virginia, no large waves were reported, which was considered unusual for how close the hurricane was to the state.|$|E

5|$|As {{the glaciers}} of the Wisconsin {{glaciation}} began to recede from the Hudson Valley area, a glacial lake {{known today as}} Lake Albany extended across the mid and upper Hudson Valley and a large delta formed west of Albany where the predecessor of the Mohawk River flowed into the lake. Along the shoreline of the lake, lacustrine sands were deposited between the present-day cities of Hudson and Glens Falls; this became the Hudson Valley sandplain. Relieved from {{the weight of the}} glacier, the land began to rebound, and the lake receded by draining into the Hudson River. The deposits of sand in the delta area were gradually sculpted by wind into sand dunes. Plants later colonized the land and stabilized <b>the</b> <b>dunes.</b> The Pine Bush originally occupied , or 60,000 acres, at which point it was the largest inland pine barrens in North America.|$|E
