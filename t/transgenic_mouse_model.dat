5000|$|Early {{experiments}} associated TNF {{with the}} pathogenesis of bacterial sepsis. Thus, the first preclinical studies using polyclonal antibodies against TNF-alpha were performed in animal models of sepsis in 1985 and showed that anti-TNF antibodies protected mice from sepsis. [...] However, subsequent clinical trials in patients with sepsis showed no significant benefit. It wasn't until 1991 that studies in a <b>transgenic</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>model</b> of overexpressed human TNF provided the pre-clinical rationale for a causal role of TNF {{in the development of}} polyarthritis and that anti-TNF treatments could be effective against human arthritides.

50|$|The role of Myl2 {{mutations}} in pathogenesis {{has been determined}} through the generation {{of a number of}} mouse models. Transgenic mice overexpressing the human MLC-2v R58Q mutation, which is associated with FHC has been shown to lead to a reduction in MLC-2v phosphorylation in hearts. These mice exhibited features of FHC, including diastolic dysfunction that progressed with age. Similarly, cardiac overexpression of another FHC-associated MLC-2v mutation (D166V) results in loss of MLC-2v phosphorylation in mouse hearts. In addition to these findings, MLC-2v dephosphorylation in mice results in cardiac dilatation and dysfunction associated with features reminiscent of dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to heart failure and premature death. Altogether these studies highlight a role for MLC-2v phosphorylation in adult heart function. These studies also suggest that torsion defects might be an early manifestation of dilated cardiomyopathy consequent to loss of MLC-2v phosphorylation. MLC-2v also {{plays an important role in}} cardiac stress associated with hypertrophy. In a novel MLC2v Ser14Ala/Ser15Ala knockin mouse model, complete loss of MLC2v (Ser14/Ser15) phosphorylation led to a worsened and differential (eccentric as opposed to concentric) response to pressure overload-induced hypertrophy. In addition, mice lacking cardiac MLCK display heart failure and experience premature death in response to both pressure overload and swimming induced hypertrophy. Consistent with these findings, a cardiac-specific <b>transgenic</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>model</b> overexpressing cardiac MLCK attenuated the response to cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload. Furthermore, in a cardiac-specific <b>transgenic</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>model</b> overexpressing skeletal myosin light chain kinase, the response to cardiac hypertrophy induced by treadmill exercise or isoproterenol was also attenuated. These studies further highlight the therapeutic potential of increasing MLC-2v phosphorylation in settings of cardiac pathological stress.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>transgenic</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>model</b> of cardiac-specific {{overexpression}} of CARP, mice exhibited normal physiology at baseline, {{but were}} protected against pathological cardiac hypertrophy induced via pressure-overload or isoproterenol, {{which could be}} attributed to the downregulation of the ERK1/2, MEK and TGFbeta-1 pathways. Another study demonstrated that adenoviral overexpression of CARP in cardiomyocytes enhances cardiac hypertrophy induced by Angiotensin II or pressure-overload and promotoes cardiomyocyte apoptosis via p53 activation and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, transgenic knockout models of either CARP alone or CARP in combination with the other muscle ankyrin repeat proteins (MARPs), ANKRD2 and ANKRD23 demonstrated a lack of cardiac phenotype; mice displayed normal cardiac function at baseline and in response to pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting that these proteins are not essential.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} histopathological {{hallmarks}} of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is cerebral deposits of extracellular β-amyloid peptides. Preclinical studies have pointed to glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP- 1) receptors as a potential novel target {{in the treatment of}} AD. GLP- 1 receptor agonists, including exendin- 4 and liraglutide, have been shown to promote plaque-lowering and mnemonic effects of in a number of experimental <b>models</b> of AD. <b>Transgenic</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> carrying genetic mutations of amyloid protein precursor (APP) and presenilin- 1 (PS 1) are commonly used to assess the pharmacodynamics of potential amyloidosis-lowering and pro-cognitive compounds. In this study, effects of long-term liraglutide treatment were therefore determined in two double APP/PS 1 <b>transgenic</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> of Alzheimer's disease carrying different clinical APP/PS 1 mutations, i. e. the 'London' (hAPPLon/PS 1 A 246 E) and 'Swedish' mutation variant (hAPPSwe/PS 1 ΔE 9) of APP, with co-expression of distinct PS 1 variants. Liraglutide was administered in 5 month-old hAPPLon/PS 1 A 246 E mice for 3 months (100 or 500 ng/kg/day, s. c.), or 7 month-old hAPPSwe/PS 1 ΔE 9 mice for 5 months (500 ng/kg/day, s. c.). In both models, regional plaque load was quantified throughout the brain using stereological methods. Vehicle-dosed hAPPSwe/PS 1 ΔE 9 mice exhibited considerably higher cerebral plaque load than hAPPLon/PS 1 A 246 E control mice. Compared to vehicle-dosed transgenic controls, liraglutide treatment had no effect on the plaque levels in hAPPLon/PS 1 A 246 E and hAPPSwe/PS 1 ΔE 9 mice. In conclusion, long-term liraglutide treatment exhibited no effect on cerebral plaque load in two <b>transgenic</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> of low- and high-grade amyloidosis, which suggests differential sensitivity to long-term liraglutide treatment in various <b>transgenic</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>models</b> mimicking distinct pathological hallmarks of AD...|$|R

Studies in a <b>transgenic</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>model</b> in which normal levels of LAMP-2A are maintained throughout life, showed that these animals had ‘cleaner’ cells, better response to stress - and overall, a better health-span.

40|$|ABSTRACTBackground: Patients {{with chronic}} {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) infection {{are at a}} high risk to develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, metabolic syndrome {{has been found to}} carry a risk for HCC development. Considering the limitation of chemotherapeutic drugs for HCCs, the development of chemopreventive agents for high risk chronic HBV carriers is urgently demanded. In this study, we used combined silymarin and resveratrol extract which have been shown to exhibit biologic effects on activating peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR) and inhibiting mTOR signaling in a <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> <b>model</b> harboring HBV viral oncoproteins. Methods: The <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> <b>model</b> harboring HBx and pre-S 2 mutant constructs which develop HCC was adopted. First, we in vitro tested the ideal combination dosages of the silymarin and resveratrol product, and then we fed the natural product to the <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice.</b> The chemopreventive effects on preventing the development of HCC were evaluated. Results: MTT assay showed an enhanced effect of the combined silymarin and resveratrol product on the reduction of cell proliferation in two hepatoma cell lines, Huh- 7 and Hep G 2. In vitro reporter assay and Western blot analyses revealed that the combined product couldactivate PPAR/PGC- 1  signaling and inhibit mTOR expression. In vivo, the combined products could significantly ameliorate fatty liver and reduce HCCs in transgenic miceharboring HBV oncoproteins. Conclusions: The combined silymarin and resveratrol product exhibits a synergistic effect on the reduction of HCC development in <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> <b>model</b> and may represent a potential agent for the prevention of HCC in high risk chronic HBV carriers.

50|$|The {{mutation}} had important {{consequences for}} Alzheimer's Disease research. The mutation {{occurs in the}} gene which encodes beta amyloid. Amyloid {{is one of the}} peptides which accumulate in the brains of people with Alzheimer's Disease. A great debate had existed between Alzheimer's Disease researchers about the relevance of amyloid prior to the 1990s - many scientists believed amyloid was a tombstone of the disease and was not critical {{to the development of the}} disease. However, because the only difference between the family members who developed Alzheimer's Disease and those that did not in these families was the inheritance of the mutation in the amyloid gene this suggested that the amyloid protein itself could cause the disease. The idea that amyloid could cause the disease influenced scientific research until this day. Many experimental treatments are directed towards lowering amyloid levels in the brain. The other main effect the discovery of the Swedish mutation had was to provide one <b>transgenic</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>model</b> of Alzheimer's Disease.
