500|$|About the {{creative}} process behind the writing, Harmon says {{that he had to}} write the show {{as if it were a}} movie, not a sitcom. Essentially, he says, the process was no different from the earlier work he had done, except for the length and the target demographic. Filming the show involved a lot of improvisation, particularly from Chevy Chase. Harmon said about Chase that he [...] "tends to come up with lines <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> end scenes with sometimes." [...] He also mentioned Joel McHale and Donald Glover, the actor who portrays Troy, as adept improvisers.|$|E
500|$|Bell X1 {{released}} {{their fourth}} studio album Blue Lights on the Runway in Ireland on 20 February 2009. It went to {{number one in}} the Irish Albums Chart. RTÉ reviewer Harry Guerin described the album as [...] "a flight <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> enjoy from start to finish". The Sunday Tribunes Neil Dunphy selected it as his CD of the week, calling it [...] "a wonderful exploration of a sound often derided for being in thrall to its influences" [...] and commenting: [...] "I don't know why but Bell X1 used to make me cringe. These days their music feels like an old friend; something solid and inspiring amid all the negativity".|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{workplace}} flirtation between Will and Emma, Gilsig deemed Terri [...] "a woman of conviction", {{willing to do}} [...] "whatever it takes" [...] to keep Will from leaving her, [...] "even if that means finding this woman and hunting her down". She explained that Will and Terri's communication is weak and that Terri is [...] "missing {{a lot of the}} skills for the marriage", and commented that Terri feels threatened by Will's commitment to the glee club, worried that it will pull him away from her. Gilsig characterized Terri as emotionally still being in high school, and explained: [...] "I think Terri still lives in that world, where I can move the pieces in such a way to create a picture, and that will make it real. I don't think she's learned <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> just have open conversations and talk about your fears and ask for your needs to be met in a direct, compassionate way. I think she's still in high school and thinking whatever you do, just don't let anybody know that you don't know what you're doing." [...] Discussing Terri's relationship with her sister Kendra, Gilsig commented: [...] "When Kendra tells Terri to do something, Terri does it. As crazy as Terri might be, she's actually pretty normal in the face of her sister. This [...] is Kendra's brainchild, and she just trusts her implicitly." ...|$|E

"I {{remember}} Lanois, {{when we were}} finishing 'Mothers of the Disappeared', {{losing his}} mind and performing at the mixing desk like he was Mozartat the piano, head blown back in an imaginary breeze, and it was pouring down with rain outside the studio and I was singing about how 'in the rain we see their tears,' the tears {{of those who have}} been disappeared. And when <b>you</b> listen to <b>that</b> mix <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> hear the rain outside. It was magical really..." [...] —Bono ...|$|R
5000|$|Dana Delany {{spoke about}} her character, Jordan Shaw: [...] "She's there {{as an example}} to show Beckett <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> <b>can</b> have it all. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> be a kick-ass agent, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be married and have a kid. Beckett doesn't have {{to shy away from}} romance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{might be}} some {{satisfaction}} though in seeing {{a man who has}} ruined you punished--at least there would be to some men. I don't know that there would be to me. It would depend upon circumstances. I am ready to believe that in those transactions of yours that brought the bank to ruin, <b>you</b> honestly believed <b>that</b> the companies <b>you</b> assisted would turn out well, and that things would come out right in the end. I do not suppose you were such a fool as to run the risk of ruin and penal servitude when you had a snug place, unless you had thought so; and, indeed, as the directors were as responsible as yourself for making those advances--although they were, of course, ignorant of the fact <b>that</b> <b>you</b> held a considerable interest in those companies--there was nothing actually criminal in those transactions. Therefore, it is only for that matter of your making off with the contents of the safe <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be <b>actually</b> prosecuted. At any rate, I have no present intention of interfering in the affair, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> remain here as Mr. Jackson up to the end of your life for what I care, if you will give me the information that I desire." ...|$|R

2500|$|Even after gaining serious attention, the {{conjecture}} {{was seen}} by contemporary mathematicians as extraordinarily difficult or perhaps inaccessible to proof.

2500|$|Stewart Mason from Allmusic said [...] "Following the Big Rawk Anthem ("Run to You") and the Sensitive Power Ballad ("Heaven"), [...] "Somebody" [...] {{covers the}} third base as a {{straight-ahead}} singalong pop song with a killer chorus. A gift to {{an entire generation}} of cover bands working the bar circuit, [...] "Somebody" [...] has a chorus so simple and catchy <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> sing along to it even if you've never actually heard the song before, and Adams and his indispensable musical partner, Jim Vallance, helpfully point out the feasibility of said activity by incorporating a large, somewhat ragged group of backing vocalists for the lengthy vamp of a fadeout. Rather like [...] "Run to You," [...] "Somebody" [...] is just slightly too schematic to qualify as an all-time heartland rock classic, but it still sounds good on the radio." ...|$|E

60|$|I have {{a drawing}} here, sketched {{many years ago}} by Hooker, {{when he made his}} investigations. It is the drawing of the flame of a lamp, but it will apply to the flame of a candle. The cup of the candle is the vessel or lamp, the melted {{spermaceti}} is the oil, and the wick is common to both. Upon that he sets this little flame, and then he represents what is true--a certain quantity of matter rising about it which you do not see, and which, if you have not been here before, or are not familiar with the subject, you will not know of. He has here represented the parts of the surrounding atmosphere that are very essential to the flame, and that are always present with it. There is a current formed, which draws the flame out--for the flame which you see is really drawn out by the current, and drawn upward to a great height--just as Hooker has here shewn you by that prolongation of the current in the diagram. You may see this by taking a lighted candle, and putting it in the sun so as to get its shadow thrown on a piece of paper. How remarkable it is that that thing which is light enough to produce shadows of other objects, can be made to throw its own shadow on a piece of white paper or card, so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> see streaming round the flame something which {{is not part of the}} flame, but is ascending and drawing the flame upwards. Now, I am going to imitate the sunlight, by applying the voltaic battery to the electric lamp. You now see our sun, and its great luminosity; and by placing a candle between it and the screen, we get the shadow of the flame.|$|E
