40|$|Background: Joint {{consultations}} - such as <b>teleconsultations</b> - {{provide opportunities}} for continuing education of general practitioners (GPs). It has been reported this form of interactive case-based learning may lead to fewer GP referrals, yet these studies have relied on expert opinion and simple frequencies, without accounting for other factors known to influence referrals. We use a survey-based discrete choice experiment of GPs' referral preferences to estimate how referral rates are associated with participation in joint <b>teleconsultations,</b> explicitly controlling {{for a number of}} potentially confounding variables. Methods: We distributed questionnaires at two meetings of the Portuguese Association of General Practice. GPs were presented with descriptions of patients with dermatological lesions and asked whether they would refer based on the waiting time, the distance to appointment, and pressure from patients for a referral. We analysed GPs' responses to multiple combinations of these factors, coupled with information on GP and practice characteristics, using a binary logit model. We estimated the probabilities of referral of different lesions using marginal effects. Results: Questionnaires were returned by 44 GPs, giving a total of 721 referral choices. The average referral rate for the 11 GPs (25 %) who had participated in <b>teleconsultations</b> was 68. 1 % (range 53 - 88 %), compared to 74. 4 % (range 47 - 100 %) for the remaining physicians. Participation in <b>teleconsultations</b> was associated with reductions in the probabilities of referral of 17. 6 % for patients presenting with keratosis (p = 0. 02), 42. 3 % for psoriasis (p < 0. 001), 8. 4 % for melanoma (p = 0. 14), and 5. 4 % for naevus (p = 0. 19). Conclusions: The results indicate that GP participation in <b>teleconsultations</b> is associated with overall reductions in referral rates and in variation across GPs, and that these effects are robust to the inclusion of other factors known to influence referrals. The reduction in range, coupled with different effects for different clinical presentations, may suggest an educational effect. However, {{more research is needed to}} establish whether there are causal relationships between participation in <b>teleconsultations,</b> continuing education, and referral rates. © 2015 Cravo Oliveira et al.; licensee BioMed Central...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Audio-visual <b>teleconsultation</b> is {{expected}} to help home-based palliative patients, hospital-based palliative care professionals, and family physicians to jointly design better, pro-active care. Consensual knowledge of the possibilities and limitations of <b>teleconsultation</b> in transmural palliative care is, however, largely lacking. This paper aims at describing elements of both the physical workplace and the cultural-social context of the palliative care practice, which are imperative {{for the use of}} <b>teleconsultation</b> technologies. METHODS: A semi-structured expert meeting and qualitative, open interviews were deployed to explore professionals' assumptions and wishes, which are considered to contain latent presumptions about the practice's physical workplace and latent elements of the cultural-social context, regarding (1) the mediating potential of audio-visual <b>teleconsultation,</b> (2) how the audio-visual teleconsultations will affect medical practice, and (3) the design and usage of the <b>teleconsultation</b> technology. We used a qualitative analysis to investigate how palliative care professionals interpret the <b>teleconsultation</b> package in preparation. The analysis entailed open and axial coding techniques developed in a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Respondents assume: 1. <b>teleconsultation</b> will hinder physical proximity, thereby compromising anamnesis and diagnosis of new or acutely ill patients as well as "real contact" with the person behind the patient; 2. <b>teleconsultation</b> will help patients becoming more of a pivotal figure in their own care trajectory; 3. they can use <b>teleconsultation</b> to keep a finger on the pulse; 4. teleconsultations have a healing effect of their own due to offered time and digital attention; 5. <b>teleconsultation</b> to open up an additional "gray" network outside the hierarchical structures of the established chain of transmural palliative care. This network could cause bypassing of caregivers and uncertainty about responsibilities; 6. teleconsultations lead to an extended flow of information which helps palliative care professionals to check the stories of patients and medical specialists. CONCLUSIONS: Professionals assume <b>teleconsultation</b> co-defines a new patient-professional relationship by extending hospital-based caregivers' perceptions of as well as attention for their patients. At the cost, however, of clinical and personal connectedness. Secondly, a hermeneutics is needed to carefully interpret <b>teleconsultation</b> images.

40|$|Background Although <b>teleconsultations</b> {{have been}} used for many years in Australia, there has been a recent {{increase}} following new government incentives. There is a paucity of literature on enabling medical students to acquire the relevant skills. With a focus on equipping students for practice in rural and remote areas, our medical school has developed an innovative clinical skills lesson to prepare our students for their rural practice placements. Methods This lesson was delivered to all students in their third year of training in small groups to enable interactive learning. The objectives of the lesson were to familiarise students with: the various methods of conducting <b>teleconsultations</b> currently in use; the legal and ethical considerations; the technical and procedural issues; and the barriers and benefits for patients and doctors. Students rotated through four different stations over 2 hours and the lesson was evaluated using a student survey. Results Medical students self-reported statistically significant improvements in understanding the issues and procedures, and in confidence in conducting a telehealth consultation. Discussion Analysis of the results and student comments demonstrated that students recognise the value of telemedicine learning, and benefit from formal teaching on all aspects of telemedicine, including technology, ethics and protocols. Interestingly, the students found the opportunity to discuss areas such as the ethics of, and barriers to, the use of <b>teleconsultations</b> to be the most challenging and helpful of all of the stations...|$|R

40|$|The overall aim of {{this study}} is twofold, firstly to explore the {{phenomenon}} of <b>teleconsultation</b> acceptance in Malaysia and then to develop an understanding of the important aspects constituting the phenomenon. This study seeks to identify the main issues concerning <b>teleconsultation</b> acceptance particularly in which the technology utilization takes place in the public health care facilities and the technology operates over a nation-wide network. This also entails an understanding of the complexities of human behaviour confined in the health care environment and work practice. The study was conducted based on the mixed methods concurrent triangulation design involving qualitative and quantitative data. These entailed interviews with key informants and questionnaires survey of health care providers who practiced in the participating hospitals in Malaysia. Thematic analysis involving hierarchical coding was conducted on qualitative data whilst several procedures were performed on quantitative data involving descriptive statistics, testing for mean differences between groups and correlation testing. Subsequently, both data were merged, compared and interpreted. In particular this study utilized a qualitative priority such that a superior emphasis was placed on the qualitative method. Thus, the qualitative method was used to conclude the overall result. Based on theory-driven and prior-research approach, a conceptual framework was developed and used to facilitate the data collection and analysis processes. The underlying framework derived from a combination of several aspects adopted from three theoretical models couple with contextual factors. These models were Technology Acceptance Model, Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and Theory of Planned Behavior. The framework derived from the reviews of four areas of concerns and these being (1) general <b>teleconsultation</b> and health Information Technology perspective, (2) contextual Malaysian perspective, (3) developing countries perspective and (4) theoretical perspective. In turn, nine factors from seven respective themes appeared to be important in describing and understanding the <b>teleconsultation</b> acceptance phenomenon in Malaysia. These factors were behavioral intention, attitude, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, service need, facilitating conditions, perceived behavioral control, trust in technology and demographic influence. Whilst prior technology acceptance research both in general technology and health Information Technology has put more attention on the centrality of perceived attributes of technology such as perceived usefulness and ease of use, this study revealed that the central issues of <b>teleconsultation</b> acceptance in the government hospitals in Malaysia were more focused on actionable and actual aspects rather than the perceived attributes of the technology. These aspects were service need, contextual facilitating conditions, trust in technology and demographic influence. The success of <b>teleconsultation</b> use does not happen in isolation. Understanding the overall stage of <b>teleconsultation</b> technology use in the participating hospitals is crucial to further explain <b>teleconsultation</b> acceptance. Even though technology acceptance was often discussed at the individual level, this study provided important information concerning acceptance of the technology at the organizational level. Thus this study demonstrated the importance of understanding <b>teleconsultation</b> core activity, processes in <b>teleconsultation</b> use, functions of stakeholders, procedures in the environment, <b>teleconsultation</b> work flow, requirements in conducting <b>teleconsultation</b> and interplay between dimensions and stages in <b>teleconsultation</b> acceptance. In turn, the study suggested that the strategies for environment, implementation, technological and individual should need broader and long-term perspectives to ensure the sustainability of <b>teleconsultation</b> initiatives. The outcome of this study increases understanding concerning <b>teleconsultation</b> technology acceptance and adoption thus contributes to both researches in telemedicine management and technology adoption in hospitals.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the paper}} is {{to carry out a}} cost-minimisation {{analysis}} in order to measure the cost saving performances of <b>teleconsultation</b> in Guiana. A prospective analysis lasting 6 months of all admissions for three pathologies (cardiology, parasitology, dermatology) at four care stations in Guiana (Saint Georges, Trois Sauts, Maripasoula and Anticum pata). A cost-minimisation analysis is carried out to compare <b>teleconsultation</b> with air medical evacuations. Fixed and variable costs are estimated in order to identify the break-even point of <b>teleconsultation.</b> Estimations are done at two levels: aggregate level where the four stations are considered jointly, and disaggregate level where these stations are assumed to be separable. It also takes into account organisational and quality effects. If the four stations are considered jointly, the break-even point is 12. 67 (Investments are assumed to last 6 years). This means that <b>teleconsultation</b> permits savings on air medical evacuation costs if thirteen evacuations are avoided each year inseparably at the four stations. We deduce a reference threshold for each station whose value is 3. 17. If stations are analysed separately, the most efficient station is Trois Sauts with the lowest break-even point, 2. 98. Saint Georges is the worst, 4. 31, and suffers from organisational problems caused by personnel turnover which inflate costs of <b>teleconsultation</b> by about 35. 96 %. Our main question is whether <b>teleconsultation</b> is cost saving and our response is based on the comparison of break-event points with the number of air medical evacuations actually avoided during the period. At the aggregate level of the four stations, <b>teleconsultation</b> is not cost saving as only three evacuations were actually prevented. However, these evacuations were avoided in Trois Sauts.

From 1998 to 2011, there were 132, 546 episodes of service using telemedicine, including real-time <b>teleconsultations,</b> teleradiology, teleultrasound, and telepathology. At present, the network includes 20 primary care units and five hospitals, covering almost 30, 000 km 2 and 500, 000 people. Units have high-resolution videoconferencing equipment, access to patients' clinical records, an image archive, and peripherals, such as electronic dermatoscopes and phonendoscopes. <b>Teleconsultations</b> are available in 15 medical specialties and areas, ranging from neurology to pediatric surgery.

The study also explores the influence of facilitating conditions on {{the acceptance of the}} technology in the health care environment in Malaysia. Further, the study compares the level of user acceptance in two organizational settings: (1) between emergency and non-emergency environment, and (2) between referring and referral hospital. This research presumes on the basis of exploratory and descriptive study engaging a survey of healthcare providers who practice in public hospitals in Malaysia. The study reports a high level of acceptance and acceptable extent of facilitating conditions of <b>teleconsultation</b> technology. Thus, some facilitating conditions demonstrate significant correlations with the acceptance of <b>teleconsultation.</b> Interestingly, the study exhibits valuable insights concerning the acceptance of <b>teleconsultation</b> technology in the respective settings being compared. Overall, the findings provide useful insights for both practitioners and future researchers of health information technology adoption studies in the relevant context...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{importance}} of service need along with perceived technology attributes in potentially influence the acceptance of <b>teleconsultation.</b> The study was conducted based on the concurrent triangulation design involving qualitative and quantitative study methods. These entailed interviews with key informants and questionnaires survey of health care providers who practiced in the participating hospitals in Malaysia. Thematic analysis involving iterative coding was conducted on qualitative data. Scale reliability test and hypothesis testing procedures were performed on quantitative data. Subsequently, both data were merged, compared and interpreted. In particular, this study utilized a qualitative priority such that a superior emphasis was placed on the qualitative method to demonstrate an overall understanding. Based on the responses of 20 key informants, there was a significant need for <b>teleconsultation</b> as a tool to extend health services to patients under constrained resources and critical conditions. Apparently, the latest attributes of <b>teleconsultation</b> technology have generally met users 2 ̆ 7 expectation but rather perceived as supportive facets in encouraging the usage. Concurrently, based on the survey engaging 72 health care providers, <b>teleconsultation</b> acceptance was statistically proven to be strongly associated with service need and not originated exclusively from the technological attributes. Additionally, the results of this study can be used to promote <b>teleconsultation</b> as an effective means in delivering better health services. Thus, the categories emerged from this study may be further revised and examined for explaining the acceptance of <b>teleconsultation</b> technology in other relevant contexts...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, telemedicine, {{or the use}} of {{information}} technology to support the delivery of health care from a distance, has increasingly gained the support of clinicians, administrators and policymakers across industrialised countries. However, the "theory of use" behind telemedicine [...] its rationale {{and the manner in which}} clinicians are expected to use it in their daily activities [...] has been only marginally investigated. In this paper we present the results of a qualitative study which examines the theory of use behind <b>teleconsultation</b> from the viewpoint of physicians (n= 37) in six specialities, practising in Quebec (Canada) hospitals. We employ Giddens' Structuration Theory (1984) to analyse the views, communications needs and referral strategies of physicians. Two questions are explored: (1) To what extent can <b>teleconsultation</b> be integrated into the routines of diverse medical specialities? and (2) Why and how might clinicians use this technology? Our research indicates that specialities relying on either thorough physical examinations or specialised investigative techniques are unlikely to restructure their work routines to accommodate <b>teleconsultation,</b> which they view as limited. Specialities that primarily exploit images or numerical data tend to perceive <b>teleconsultation</b> as more useful. The perceived enabling properties of <b>teleconsultation</b> increase as a function of the distance the patient would have to travel to be seen directly by a consultant. The constraining properties are linked to the type of information transmitted, since physicians believe that only objective data can be safely consulted from a distance, whereas relying on the remote physician's interpretation of subjective information is deemed inappropriate. We thus conclude that the development of <b>teleconsultation</b> should be consolidated around applications whose theory of use is compatible with existing clinical routines, or offers opportunities to restructure clinical work according to the needs of providers and remote communities.

40|$|A 12 -month {{trial of}} teledentistry was {{conducted}} in two general dental practices (one in the Orkney Islands {{and one in the}} Scottish Highlands at Kingussie). The dental practices had a PC-based videoconferencing link, connected by ISDN at 128 kbit/s, to a restorative specialist at a hospital in Aberdeen. Twenty-five patients were recruited into the trial. A cost-minimization analysis was undertaken by comparing the costs of teledentistry with two alternatives: outreach visits, where the specialist regularly visited the remote communities, and hospital visits, where patients in remote communities travelled to hospital for consultation. For Orkney patients, dental <b>teleconsultations</b> cost the National Health Service (NHS) an additional 36 per patient compared with outreach visits, but cost-savings of 270 per patient could be achieved compared with hospital visits. For Kingussie patients, <b>teleconsultations</b> cost the NHS an additional 44 and there were cost-savings of 1. 54 compared with outreach visits and hospitals visits, respectively. However, patients incurred additional costs for radiographs and photographs, and the general dental practitioner incurred additional preparation time costs. When the value of patient time was included, there were cost-savings of around 900 per Orkney patient compared with hospital visits, but compared with outreach visits teledentistry cost an additional 180 per patient. Based on the trial data, there were no cost-savings from teledentistry for Kingussie patients, even when the value of time was included. These results were relatively robust in a sensitivity analysis. However, we estimated that the cost-effectiveness of teledentistry would improve with greater familiarity and use of equipment. Benefits and cost-savings would be greatest in island or remote communities, where patients have to travel long distances to hospital for specialist consultations.

40|$|Tertiary teledermatology (TTD) -secondary-care to tertiary-care teleconsultation-is applied rarely {{compared}} with the frequently applied secondary teledermatology (primary to secondary care). The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of TTD on referrals from peripheral dermatologists to the tertiary center and to evaluate acceptance of TTD. From May 2010 to May 2012, 39 dermatologists could send in <b>teleconsultations</b> to one of two tertiary centers. Physical referrals to the tertiary centers prevented by TTD were calculated based on questions before and after TTD. The acceptance of the TTD system was evaluated through questionnaires, a focus group meeting, and personal interviews. Eighty-five <b>teleconsultations</b> were sent by 13 peripheral dermatologists from nine care institutions and answered by 8 tertiary dermatologists. Of the patients, 62 % (n= 53) would have been referred physically to the tertiary center if teledermatology were not available. In this group, teledermatology prevented 81 % (n= 43) of physical referrals. Dermatologists indicated that TTD had important advantages such as fast response time, formalized records, and data and privacy security. However, the current work process using telephone and e-mail was preferred because of its ease of use and direct personal network. The following conditions that could lead to successful implementation were indicated: (1) a national TTD system including all dermatologists indexed according their subspecialty, (2) ability to send the TTD consultation to a dermatologist personally, (3) ability to discuss a case with multiple dermatologists, (4) connections to electronic health records, and (5) change in policies of tertiary centers or health insurers, where they would stimulate the use of TTD consultation for all referrals and questions. Although quantitative results indicate that TTD can be used to improve triage between secondary and tertiary centers and dermatologists perceived advantages of TTD, the motivation to use TTD in this setting was lacking as current work processes were easier to us...|$|R
