25|$|The side bolstering in the DeLorean was {{originally}} {{separate from the}} main interior pieces. In cars with this construction, {{is a tendency to}} place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the <b>trim</b> <b>panel.</b> To fix this problem, cars built in and after late 1981 have one solid trim piece with the bolster permanently attached.|$|E
25|$|The 1960 Edsel Ranger four-door hardtop model {{uses the}} thin-pillar Ford Fairlane four-door sedan roofline, {{as opposed to}} the squarish roof-line used on the {{corresponding}} Ford four-door hardtop, which is exclusive to the Galaxie line. The Galaxie four-door hardtop's rear door <b>trim</b> <b>panel,</b> however, is fitted to the Ranger. This gives the Edsel four-door hardtop a unique body style that was never offered on any 1960 Ford-badged vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The 1967 models {{received}} {{nothing more}} than a touch-up after a restyling for 1966. All Novas got a crosshatch pattern that filled the deck lid <b>trim</b> <b>panel.</b> The Nova officially was still called the Chevy II Nova and had overtaken the bottom-rung Chevy II 100 in sales. The Chevy II 100 lacked {{much in the way of}} trim or brightwork. 1967 models carried significant improvements in the area of safety equipment. A government-mandated energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, soft interior parts such as armrests and sun visors, recessed instrument panel knobs, and front shoulder belt anchors, were included in all 1967 models.|$|E

2500|$|A Caprice Custom Sedan option package (RPO Z18) {{was offered}} on the 1965 Chevrolet Impala 4-door hardtop, adding $200 to the $2,742 price tag. The Caprice option {{included}} a heavier frame, suspension changes, black accented front grille and rear <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> with Caprice nameplate, slender body sill moldings, Fleur-de-lis roof quarter emblems, color-keyed bodyside stripes and Caprice hood and dash emblems. Full wheel covers {{were the same}} as that year's Super Sport, but the [...] "SS" [...] emblem {{in the center of the}} spinner was replaced by a Chevy bowtie. The Super Sport's blackout rear <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> was also used, without the [...] "Impala SS" [...] nameplate. The interior featured a higher-grade cloth and vinyl seat and door trim (as well as thicker, higher-grade carpeting), faux walnut trim on the dashboard and door panels, pull straps on the doors and extra convenience lights. A full vinyl roof was optional. A , [...] V8 engine was standard.|$|E
2500|$|The 1969 {{model was}} built on a new {{platform}} with a [...] wheelbase. It was the end for the 427 and 428 engines, save for only the police package versions which continued to use the 360hp 428 P Code 'Police Interceptor' as their top motor for 1969-70. Replacing the FE series-based 427 and 428 engines was the new [...] "ThunderJet" [...] that {{was introduced in the}} 1968 Ford Thunderbird; {{it was part of the}} new Ford 385 engine series. Power, at [...] for the dual-exhaust 4-barrel version, was higher than the 428's [...] and lower than the racing-bred 427's final rating of there was also a single-exhaust 2-barrel version with [...] available. The dashboard was built as a pod around the driver rather than traditionally extending across both sides. The XL and Galaxie 500 Sportsroof had rear sail panels to simulate a fastback roofline. The rear <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> below the tail lights was used to distinguish the different trim levels. The Country Squire was, perhaps, the pinnacle of design for that wagon with the concealed headlights.|$|E
5000|$|Interior: Complete {{interior}} (for {{example for}} the Mercedes-Benz SL and for the Maybach luxury limousine), side/roof/door <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> (for example the FIS door module for the BMW 7 Series), center console, gearshift/transmission selector lever.|$|E
5000|$|The 300M Special {{was offered}} {{beginning}} midyear 2002. It featured a [...] 3.5 liter engine designed to use premium (91+ octane) gasoline and producing [...] of torque, with a 3.89 final drive ratio. Performance-type dual exhaust, high-performance brakes, and 18-inch Z-rated tires were standard, with Michelin Pilot Sport 245/45R18 performance tires optional. Other standard {{features of the}} Special included premium [...] "Waterfall" [...] leather seats, signal mirrors, body cladding, and slightly lower ride height. This model also included high-intensity discharge headlamps and imitation-carbon-fiber interior <b>trim</b> <b>panels</b> that replaced the standard woodgrain <b>trim</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} the rebuilding, the {{cracking}} problems continued and the Scenicruisers that {{made it into the}} 1970s again had some external <b>trim</b> <b>panels</b> removed and further reinforcements added.|$|R
5000|$|... 1998 - Guardian {{acquired}} trim manufacturer Lab. Radio in Valencia, Spain. Founded in 1977, products included wheel covers, interior <b>trim</b> <b>panels,</b> emblems, cowl panels, door belt moldings, radiator grilles and air bag covers.|$|R
5000|$|The Two-Ten {{shared the}} {{wedge-shaped}} side trim with the Bel Air, {{but unlike the}} Bel Air (which had the wedge filled with an aluminum <b>trim</b> <b>panel)</b> the Two-Ten's wedge was painted either body color, or top color with the optional two-tone paint package. [...] "Chevrolet" [...] in script was mounted inside the wedge.|$|E
5000|$|The {{wedge shape}} of the two-door model was distinctive, {{extending}} {{all the way to}} the unusually high rear end. In response to criticism of the tail design, a black plastic <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> between the tail lights was added. Like many other BMW models, the C-pillar of the E21 features a Hofmeister kink.|$|E
50|$|The Carriage Roof option (still only {{available}} in white canvas-embossed vinyl; but now standard on Bill Blass Designer Series) received new interior rear quarter <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> inserts (a blanked off, color-keyed padded vinyl insert filler panel covering {{the area where}} the deleted opera windows were - with round (non-switch-operated) reading/courtesy lights in the center of these panels on each side; thus effectively replacing 1978's rear quarter panel vanity mirrors). These new interior quarter <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> inserts would also appear on the Collector's Series, (in color-keyed vinyl, or cloth - depending on the seat trim color) as the exterior landau roof design also eliminated the opera windows on this model. Here, though, the reading/courtesy lights in these quarter panel inserts had control switches above the rear seat quarter armrests, to allow them to operate as customary door-jamb activated interior courtesy lights, as well as rear seat passengers being able to switch them on and off independently as true reading lamps.|$|E
50|$|For 2017, a 200S Alloy Edition model becomes available, adding bronze-painted accents (front grille, wheels, and {{interior}} <b>trim</b> <b>panels)</b> {{to the base}} 200S model. The 200S Alloy Edition became available in midyear 2016 (2016.5).|$|R
40|$|An {{aircraft}} cabin acoustic enclosure, built {{in support of}} the Propfan Test Assessment (PTA) program, is described. Helmholtz resonators were attached to the cabin <b>trim</b> <b>panels</b> to increase the sidewall transmission loss (TL). Resonators (448) were located between the <b>trim</b> <b>panels</b> and fuselage shell. In addition, 152 resonators were placed between the enclosure and aircraft floors. The 600 resonators were each tuned to a 235 Hz resonance frequency. After flight testing on the PTA aircraft, the enclosure was tested in the Kelly Johnson R and D Center Acoustics Lab. Laboratory noise reduction (NR) test results are discussed. The enclosure was placed in a Gulfstream 2 fuselage section. Broadband (138 dB overall SPL) and tonal (149 dB overall SPL) excitations were used in the lab. Tonal excitation simulated the propfan flight test excitation. The fundamental tone was stepped in 2 Hz intervals from 225 through 245 Hz. The resonators increase the NR of the cabin walls around the resonance frequency of the resonator array. The effects of flanking, sidewall absorption, cabin adsorption, resonator loading of <b>trim</b> <b>panels,</b> and panel vibrations are presented. Increases in NR of up to 11 dB were measured...|$|R
5000|$|The STS {{interior}} had a 12-way power {{front seat}}, manual articulating front seat headrests, center front armrest with cassette and coin/cup storage console trimmed in ultrasoft leather, net-type map pockets, rear bucket seats with integral headrests, center rear console and rear storage compartment, leather-wrapped {{front and rear}} door <b>trim</b> <b>panels,</b> door pull straps and overhead pull straps, high-gloss elm burl real wood appliques on door <b>trim</b> <b>panels</b> and switch plates, horn pad and bar, instrument panel and front and rear consoles, Beechwood Thaxton floor carpet and a decklid liner in tara material with STS logo. Other standard STS features (these were options on the standard Seville) were: automatic door locks, illuminated driver and passenger side visor vanity mirrors, illuminated entry system, rear window defogger, theft-deterrent system and trunk mat.|$|R
5000|$|A Caprice Custom Sedan option package (RPO Z18) {{was offered}} on the 1965 Chevrolet Impala 4-door hardtop, adding $200 to the $2,742 price tag.

5000|$|For the 1963 model year, the {{wheelbase}} {{was increased}} to 119 {{in and the}} car received new sheet metal. The Dart name was reassigned to Dodge's line of compact cars {{that had previously been}} known as the Dodge Lancer. Positioned below the Polara were the plain 440 and 330. The 1964 models received a revised front end and new tail lamps to distinguish them from the 1963 cars. Rear end treatment took its inspiration from the Chevrolet Impala, the Polara models now featuring six small, square-shaped taillights (three on each side) surrounded by an attractive bright <b>trim</b> <b>panel.</b> Lesser mid-size Dodges featured only four taillights (two on each side) and lacked the bright <b>trim</b> <b>panel.</b> A sensational new [...] "C" [...] pillar for the hardtop coupes, combined with the more attractive front and rear end styling, made the '64s look totally new (and longer/ lower/wider as well), resulting in a significant increase of sales over 1963.|$|E
50|$|The side bolstering in the DeLorean was {{originally}} {{separate from the}} main interior pieces. There {{is a tendency to}} place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the car. This will eventually cause the bolstering to become separated from the <b>trim</b> <b>panel.</b> To help fix this problem, cars built in and after late 1981 have one solid trim piece with the bolster permanently attached.|$|E
50|$|Finally, a Sport Appearance Package is {{available}} on the top-of-the-line limited trim level, and adds the following equipment to it: gloss black side mirrors and door handles, gloss black fascia inserts, twenty-inch alloy wheels with gloss black-painted accents and tires, a two-tone black-and-gray leather-trimmed interior, and aluminum interior <b>trim</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Center console buttons were rearranged, {{with the}} clock in the middle. The {{convertible}} top received three layers of insulation instead of one for better weather protection. Facelifted models could also be ordered with optional side airbags, detectable as two separate <b>trim</b> <b>panels</b> in the doors. The electronic stability control was upgraded from ASC to DSC.|$|R
50|$|The stylist {{responsible}} {{for the design of}} the vehicle interior develops the proportions, shape, placement, and surfaces for the instrument <b>panel,</b> seats, door <b>trim</b> <b>panels,</b> headliner, pillar <b>trims,</b> etc. Here the emphasis is on ergonomics and the comfort of the passengers. The procedure here is the same as with exterior design (sketch, digital model and clay model).|$|R
5000|$|... 1962's styling {{remained}} {{similar to}} 1961, and Sixty Special's fender louvers were {{moved up to}} the roof, directly behind the rear door opening. A revised grill up front, and a new <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> below the rear deck lid rounded out the subtle changes. Sales slipped to 13,350 this year at a base price of $6,366. A power trunk lid was an option. The heater was now standard.|$|E
5000|$|The 1960 Edsel Ranger four-door hardtop {{model used}} the thin-pillar Ford Fairlane four-door sedan roofline, {{as opposed to}} the [...] "square" [...] roof-line used on the {{corresponding}} Ford four-door hardtop, which was exclusive to the Galaxie line. The Galaxie four-door hardtop's rear door <b>trim</b> <b>panel,</b> however, was fitted to the Ranger. This gave the Edsel four-door hardtop a unique body style that was never offered on any 1960 Ford.|$|E
5000|$|Joining the {{optional}} Full Vinyl and Rear Landau Vinyl roof options for 1978, was a new, full-length, simulated convertible [...] "Carriage Roof" [...] option (available only in white canvas-embossed vinyl - with interior rear seat side-quarter <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> vanity mirrors - {{in place of}} the normally standard opera windows, which were deleted with this option). The Power Glass Moonroof option was not available on Mark V when equipped with the Carriage Roof.|$|E
5000|$|In February 1961 the BLSIP-3 was released. It {{featured}} the new [...] 1.9 L GB-4 inline-four engine. The front end was changed slightly, with the [...] "PRINCE" [...] grille letters removed and instead a Prince badge {{on the left}} front side of the hood. The side trim and rear <b>trim</b> <b>panels</b> remained identical to the BLSIP-2.|$|R
5000|$|The Comet was {{available}} as 2- and 4-door sedans and in base (1971-1977), and [...] "muscle car" [...] Comet GT series (2-door sedan-only 1971-1975).

50|$|Standard {{equipment}} included power steering, brakes, windows, vacuum activated concealed headlamps, {{and split}} bench electrically adjustable front seats. The instrument <b>panel</b> and <b>trim</b> <b>panels</b> {{on the doors}} featured simulated wood appliques in either English Oak or East-Indian Rosewood. After a few months, a Cartier-branded clock became standard equipment. The upholstery was either the standard vinyl with cloth inserts, or the optional leather.|$|R
5000|$|New for 1957 was the 283 in³ small-block V8. Even {{the fuel}} {{injected}} version {{was available to}} 210 buyers. The 210, including the Delray, shared the wedge-shaped side trim with the Bel Air, but unlike the Bel Air (which had the wedge filled with an aluminum <b>trim</b> <b>panel)</b> the 210's wedge was painted either body color, or top color with the optional two-tone paint package. [...] "Chevrolet" [...] in script was mounted inside the wedge.|$|E
50|$|The St. Paul Manor Apartments is a 4-1/2-story U-shaped brick Art Deco {{structure}} containing 36 apartments. A commercial {{space is}} located in the basement. The main facades contain precast concrete/stone panels rising from a heavy precast base and stretching the full height of the building, topped with half round arches. These panels surround each window opening, and incorporate ornamental medallions and various relief <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> styles. The entrance is {{in the center of the}} building, within a projecting one-story vestibule.|$|E
5000|$|... 1971: The LTD {{was given}} a styling update. In the rear, the long-running Ford styling {{tradition}} ended as the twin round or square [...] "jet exhaust" [...] taillights were replaced by horizontal taillights on all full-size Fords. [...] In between the two tail lamps was a center [...] "third" [...] brakelight; on the Galaxie 500, this space was an alloy <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> while Custom 500s had body-color trim. In front, the LTD lost its hidden headlamps to Lincoln-Mercury, but got a new front end treatment with a tall center grille section and [...] "LTD" [...] spelled out in block letters on the hood.|$|E
50|$|All models got new, flatter dash <b>trim</b> <b>panels,</b> {{black on}} the lower two trims and aluminum-look on the fancier two. Base models {{received}} the flatter stainless hubcaps, and Stepsides got new squared-off taillights with built-in backup lights and side markers, while the rear fenders were smoothed out where the old side markers were. Fuel doors were added on models equipped with a bed to hide the previously exposed fuel caps.|$|R
50|$|An all-new, upscale {{interior}} {{will offer}} an optional UVO infotainment system, with support for both Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto technologies.
