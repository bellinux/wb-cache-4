50|$|Since 1780, {{the horse}} has been 'scoured' several times. In 1935, it was dressed {{with a mixture}} of {{concrete}} and chalk, and it was cleaned up in 1994. A major restoration was carried out in 2002 by the Cherhill White Horse Restoration Group, when the horse was resurfaced with one hundred and sixty tonnes of new chalk, the outline was re-cut, and shuttering was added to hold the chalk in place. <b>This</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> by a grant of £18,000 from the National Trust.

50|$|Challenger was in {{residence}} at Beaconsfield BAW (Vauxhall, London) under the curatorial direction of David Crawforth and Naomi Siderfin, from Jun 2012 - Feb 2013, where she began exploring cultural homogeneity and the 'selfie' portrait through her project Monoculture. As part of this work she constructed a large scale installation that comprised a polytunnel concealed within the gallery's (site-specific) arch tunnel space, where she grew her own 'cash' crop of oil seed rape with nothing but artificial light and warmth.In Feb 2013 the Monoculture show was premiered and consisted of new large scale sculptural works that explore the relationship between social media, sexuality and self-representation. The work was recommended by the Contemporary Art Society in April 2013. <b>This</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> by the Arts Council.|$|E
50|$|After World War II, when McClure {{served in}} the U.S. Navy, {{he was hired by}} the State of California to study an {{outbreak}} of encephalitis in horses in Bakersfield. As a result of this work, Walter Reed Institutes of Research sent him on a mission to Japan in 1950. McClure went to Japan to study arthropod borne diseases. <b>This</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> by the US Army, 406 Medical General Laboratory. The work involved collecting bird blood samples for testing viruses. Here McClure discovered that birds that were shot showed blood that appeared to be positive for viruses while those samples examined from blood drawn from mist-netted (mist nets were a Japanese innovation) specimens appeared to be negative. This demonstrated methodological errors and from then on all samples were collected only from traps.|$|E
5000|$|The {{church was}} used by a theatre group between 1957 and 1987, but by the latter date it had become {{structurally}} unsafe. It then continued to deteriorate until it was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust in 1996. By this time some emergency repairs had been carried out, which were financed by English Heritage. The Trust then continued to repair the building, planning this in two phases. In the first phase, the church was made dry and stable. The second phase involved cleaning {{the interior of the}} church, including the wall paintings, limewashing the remainder of the walls that had been painted black by the theatre company, refurbishing the vestry, and providing wheelchair access. <b>This</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> {{by a grant from the}} Heritage Lottery Fund and was completed in 2003.

50|$|At {{the same}} time Shelly became a {{community}} organizer, directing a CODEPINK chapter in Madison, WI and was {{an active member of}} the then Wisconsin Coordinating Council on Nicaragua. Through solidarity relationships with the women’s social movement in Nicaragua (Movimiento Autónomo de Mujeres), Grabe became learned in women of Color and “Third World” feminisms from a grassroots, decolonial perspective. She used this perspective to push a new area of inquiry into the investigation of social inequities or male dominance in a cross-cultural and interdisciplinary context. To do so, she coupled her interests in structural inequities, gender, and globalization with her research training to work with transnational women’s organizations. Together they pushed new areas of inquiry that had the potential to support positive social change for women. During her postdoctoral years she was awarded a Visiting Scholar position in the Department of Gender and Women’s Studies at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and received funding from the National Science Foundation to begin an investigation in Nicaragua. <b>This</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> by mentor, colleague, and friend, Carlos Arenas.|$|E
