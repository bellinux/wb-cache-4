Aiming at {{the problem}} of {{modeling}} and compensation of the fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) drift caused by temperature, a novel compensation method for FOG temperature drift based on transformed unscented Kalman filter (TUKF) is proposed. Elman network with faster convergence speed is used to modeling and TUKF algorithm is adopted to train the weights of Elman network, which effectively solves the problem of numerical instability. The results prove that the proposed method has higher precision compared with Elman network and IUKF network models. By using the TUKF algorithm, the root mean square errors (RMSE) are improved by 60 % in <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> <b>period</b> and 50. 5 % in fall period...|$|E
40|$|The gas {{production}} behavior from methane hydrate in the sediment by depressurization {{was investigated in}} a novel pilot-scale hydrate simulator (PHS), a three-dimensional pressure vessel of 117. 8 L Experimental results are compared with those in a cubic hydrate simulator (CHS) with the effective volume of 5. 8 L to reveal the dependence of the production behavior {{on the size of}} the hydrate reservoir. Results show that the {{gas production}} processes in the two simulators consist of three periods: the free gas production, mixed gas (free gas and gas dissociated from the hydrate) production and gas production from hydrate dissociation. The first and second periods are mainly controlled by the pressure reduction rate. The heat conduction from the ambient is main driving force to dissociate the hydrate in the third period. The cumulative gas production in the third period with the PHS and CHS is much higher than those in the first and second periods. However, the gas production rate in the period is low. The duration for gas production with the PHS is approximately 20 times as many as that with the CHS. Water production behavior with the PHS is different with that with the CHS during the gas production. The system temperature change tendency with the PHS is the same with that with the CHS during the gas production. The unique difference is that there is also a <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> <b>period</b> with the CHS. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. </p...|$|E
40|$|Winter {{irrigation}} {{is one of}} {{the water}} and salt management practices widely adopted in arid irrigated areas in the Tarim Basin located in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the People’s Republic of China. A winter irrigation study was carried out from November 2013 to March 2014 in Korla City. A cotton field was divided into 18 plots with a size of 3 m × 3 m and five winter irrigation treatments (1200 m 3 /ha, 1800 m 3 /ha, 2400 m 3 /ha, 3000 m 3 /ha, and 3600 m 3 /ha) and one non-irrigation as a control were designed. The results showed that the higher winter irrigation volumes allowed the significant short-term difference after the irrigation in the fields with the higher soil moisture content. Therefore, the soil moisture in the next sowing season could be maintained at the level which was slightly lower than field capacity and four times that in the non-irrigation treatment. The desalination effect of winter irrigation increased with the increase of water irrigation volume, but its efficiency decreased with the increase of water irrigation volume. The desalination effect was characterized by short-term desalination, long-term salt accumulation, and the time-dependent gradually decreasing trend. During the winter irrigation period, air temperature was the most important external influencing factor of the soil temperature. During the period of the decrease in winter temperatures from December to January, soil temperature in the 5 -cm depth showed no significant difference in all the treatments and the control. However, during the period of rising temperatures from January to March, soil temperature in the control increased significantly, faster than that in all treatments. Under the same irrigation volume, the temperature difference between the upper soil layer and the lower soil layer increased during the temperature drop period and decreased during the <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> <b>period.</b> In this paper, we proposed the proper winter irrigation volume of 1800 – 3000 m 3 /ha and suggested that the irrigation timing should be delayed to early December or performed in several stages in the fields with the drainage system.

Current research suggests that both energy and thermal performance can be improved in UFAD systems by ducting air to perimeter zones where loads tend to be the greatest. Critics suggest however that such underfloor ducting reduces the benefit of having a low-pressure plenum space, as well as adding design and installation complications when fitting ducts between floor tile pedestals.|$|R

40|$|The <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> of {{concrete}} during curing {{is dependent on}} the mixture composition and proportions, among which the cement content should be the major factor. If the water content is relatively low, however, the cement would not fully hydrate and the water content should also have significant effects. This paper reports an experimental program aiming to investigate the combined effects of cement and water contents by measuring the adiabatic <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> {{of concrete}} mixtures with different mixture proportions. A newly developed semi-adiabatic curing test method with heat loss compensation applied was employed to measure the adiabatic <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> of the concrete mixtures. The results reveal that, for a given paste volume, the adiabatic <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> would be highest at a water-cement ratio (w/c) of 0. 36; therefore, the adiabatic <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> of a higher strength concrete is not necessarily higher. Furthermore, the degree of hydration would gradually decrease as the w/c decreases. Based on these results, design charts and formulas for predicting the adiabatic <b>temperature</b> <b>rise,</b> heat generation, and degree of hydration of concrete mixtures with w/c ranging from 0. 28 to 0. 48 have been developed.

40|$|We {{report on}} a {{numerical}} study conducted to investigate the effect of various parameters on the heat exchange inside a vertical ground loop heat exchanger (VGLHE) for a ground-source heat pump (GSHP) system. The simulations were conducted for three piping configurations of the ground loop which were U-Tube, Concentric pipes and Spiral. The results show a linear <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> along the pipe length for the U-Tube configuration. The Concentric pipes configuration shows two distinct linear trends for the temperature rise; a slow <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> during the downward flow through the inner pipe and a higher <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> during the upflow through the annulus. The Spiral configuration shows a steeper slope for the <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> in the spiral section and almost a flat slope for the <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> in the straight vertical section of the pipe. The research also examines a simulation case of integrating a VGLHE inside of a micro-pile foundation system...|$|R
