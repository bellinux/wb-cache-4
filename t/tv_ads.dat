5|$|Another {{way that}} machinima {{demonstrates}} intertextuality {{is in its}} tendency to make frequent references to texts, works, and other media just like <b>TV</b> <b>ads</b> or humorous cartoons such as The Simpsons might do. For example, the machinima series Freeman's Mind, created by Ross Scott, is filmed by taking a recording of Scott playing through the game Half Life as a player normally would and combining it with a voiceover (also recorded by Scott) to emulate an inner monologue of the normally voiceless protagonist Gordon Freeman. Scott portrays Freeman as a snarky, sociopathic character who makes frequent references to works and texts including science fiction, horror films, action movies, American history, and renowned novels such as Moby Dick. These references to works outside the game, often triggered by events within the game, are prime examples of the densely intertextual nature of machinima.|$|E

25|$|Some EV1 enthusiasts {{believed}} that GM was demonstrating ambivalence towards {{promotion of the}} EV1 after its initial release. While {{one of the first}} EV1 TV spots was nominated for an Emmy Award, later advertising was limited to direct mail and print and <b>TV</b> <b>ads</b> in niche channels.
