Art appreciation must consider attitudes toward inquiring critically into art, through social-cultural approach. <b>The</b> <b>methodologies</b> <b>of</b> art history and artistic analysis reflect different ways of interpreting art. Since all works of art are expressions of their maker and their culture and also dependent on their medium, each work is complex and may have multiples levels of meaning. And that is also in art appreciation. <b>The</b> <b>methodologies</b> <b>of</b> art in today is used in artistic analysis : formal analysis, iconology and icongraphy, Marxism, Feminism, biography and autobiography, semiotics, and psychoanalysis.

5|$|Weber's {{thinking}} was {{strongly influenced by}} German idealism and particularly by neo-Kantianism, {{to which he had}} been exposed through Heinrich Rickert, his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg.

Weber's opinions regarding <b>the</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>of</b> the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist Georg Simmel.|$|E

5|$|Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} and refutation of climate change denial. In her foreword to the book, Naomi Oreskes writes that people fall victim to the phenomenon of denial due to feeling frightened. The book examines several arguments against global warming, and uses peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus to back-up rationale for disputing the validity of each argument. <b>The</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>of</b> those denying climate change is assessed, including: cherry picking data purporting to support their specific viewpoints, maintaining a high bar for evidence of climate change by those denying it, and criticism {{of the values of}} climate scientists themselves. The book puts forth an explanation why certain individuals, and the wider public, have a tendency to deny the scientific consensus for climate change.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} refers to {{issues at the}} theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about <b>the</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>of</b> psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases {{in which there is}} no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a Likert scale, they may be experiencing very different things.|$|E
