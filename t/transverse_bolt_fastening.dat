40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the development of intelligent fastening tool tracking systems for the automotive industry to identify the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolts.</b> In order to accomplish such a task, the position of the tool tip must be identified because the tool tip position coincides {{with the head of the}} <b>fastened</b> <b>bolt</b> while the tool <b>fastens</b> the <b>bolt.</b> The proposed systems utilize an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and another sensor to track the position and orientation of the tool tip. To minimize the position and orientation calculation error, an IMU needs to be calibrated as accurately as possible. This research presents a novel triaxial accelerometer calibration technique that offers a high accuracy. The simulation and experimental results of the accelerometer calibration are presented. To identify the fastening action, an expert system is developed based on the sensor measurements. When a fastening action is identified, the system identifies the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolt</b> by using an expert system based on the position and orientation of the tool tip and the position and orientation of the <b>bolt.</b> Since each <b>fastening</b> procedure needs different accuracies and requirements, three different systems are proposed. The first system utilizes a triaxial magnetometer and an IMU to identify the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolt.</b> This system calculates the position and orientation by using an IMU. An expert system is used to identify the initial position, stationary state, and the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolt.</b> When the tool <b>fastens</b> a <b>bolt,</b> the proposed expert system detects the fastening action by triaxial accelerometer and triaxial magnetometer measurements. When the fastening action is detected, the system corrects the velocity and position error using zero velocity update (ZUPT). By using the corrected tool tip position and orientation, the system can identify the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolts.</b> Then, with the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolt</b> position, the position of the IMU is corrected. When the tool is stationary, the system corrects linear velocity error and reduces the position error. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can identify <b>fastened</b> <b>bolts</b> if the angles of the bolts are different or the bolts are not closely placed. This low cost system does not require a line of sight, but has limited position accuracy. The second system utilizes an intelligent system that incorporates Kalman filters (KFs) and a fuzzy expert system to track the tip of a fastening tool and to identify the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolt.</b> This system employs one IMU and one encoder-based position sensor to determine the orientation and the centre of mass location of the tool. When the KF is used, the orientation error increases over time due to the integration step. Therefore, a fuzzy expert system is developed to correct the tilt angle error and orientation error. When the tool <b>fastens</b> a <b>bolt,</b> the system identifies the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolt</b> by applying the fuzzy expert system. When the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolt</b> is identified, the 3 D orientation error of the tool is corrected by using the location and the orientation of the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolt</b> and the position sensor outputs. This orientation correction method results in improved reliability in determining the tool tip location. The fastening tool tracking system was experimentally tested in a lab environment, and the results indicate that such a system can successfully identify the <b>fastened</b> <b>bolts.</b> This system not only has a low computational cost but also provides good position and orientation accuracy. The system can be used for most applications because it provides a high accuracy. The third system presents a novel position/orientation tracking methodology by hybridizing one position sensor and one factory calibrated IMU with the combination of a particle filter (PF) and a KF. In addition, an expert system is used to correct the angular velocity measurement errors. The experimental results indicate that the orientation errors of this method are significantly reduced compared to the orientation errors obtained from an EKF approach. The improved orientation estimation using the proposed method leads to a better position estimation accuracy. The experimental results of this system show that the orientation of the proposed method converges to the correct orientation even when the initial orientation is completely unknown. This new method was applied to the fastening tool tracking system. This system provides good orientation accuracy even when the gyroscopes (gyros hereafter) include a small error. In addition, since the orientation error of this system does not grow over time, the tool tip position drift is limited. This system can be applied to the applications where the bolts are closely placed. The position error comparison results of the second system and the third system are presented in this thesis. The comparison results indicate that the position accuracy of the third system is better than that of the second system because the orientation error does not increase over time. The advantages and limitations of all three systems are compared in this thesis. In addition, possible future work on fastening tool tracking system is described as well as applications that can be expanded by using the KF/PF combination method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The FE {{model of}} a {{combined}} gantry milling machine was constructed. The joint stiffness of <b>bolt</b> <b>fastening,</b> ball screw, and roller guideway were calculated.

The result of “considering joint stiffness ” modal analysis was more accurate than “unconsidering joint stiffness”, especially the 5 th-order natural frequency had a difference of up to 52. 2 %. The harmonic analysis result showed that the response amplitude of the spindle center was comparatively large in three directions when the 1 st-order and the 17 th-order natural frequency were working, so the frequencies should be avoided while working...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a {{formulation}} able to predict the resistance of simple shear connections realized by fastening a plate to a hollow square section by means of long bolts. The research is motivated by the fact that the rules currently provided by EC 3 for defining the bearing resistance of steel connections are limited to the case of stacks of plates, where every plate composing the connection is always restrained out of plane by the adjoining plate or by the bolt head or nut. This is a condition not verified in case of connections realized with long <b>bolts</b> <b>fastening</b> hollow sections. The work is organized in two sections. First, the results of an experimental campaign are presented and successively, the results of a parametric analysis carried out by means of a Finite Element model calibrated on the experimental data are reported.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} liaison to better integrate product model and assembly process model so as to enable sharing of design and assembly process information in a common integrated form and reason about them. Liaison {{can be viewed as}} a set, usually a pair, of features in proximity with which process information can be associated. A liaison is defined as a set of geometric entities on the parts being assembled and relations between these geometric entities. Liaisons have been defined for riveting, welding, <b>bolt</b> <b>fastening,</b> screw fastening, adhesive bonding (gluing) and blind fastening processes. The liaison captures process specific information through attributes associated with it. The attributes are associated with process details at varying levels of abstraction. A data structure for liaison has been developed to cluster the attributes of the liaison based on the level of abstraction. As information about the liaisons is not explicitly available in either the part model or the assembly model, algorithms have been developed for extracting liaisons from the assembly model. The use of liaison is proposed to enable both the construction of process model as the product model is fleshed out, as well as maintaining integrity of both product and process models as the inevitable changes happen to both design and the manufacturing environment during the product lifecycle. Results from aerospace and automotive domains have been provided to illustrate and validate the use of liaisons. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
