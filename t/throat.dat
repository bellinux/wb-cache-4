5|$|Streptococcal pharyngitis, {{also known}} as strep <b>throat,</b> is an {{infection}} {{of the back of}} the <b>throat</b> including the tonsils caused by group A streptococcus (GAS). Common symptoms include fever, sore <b>throat,</b> red tonsils, and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. A headache, and nausea or vomiting may also occur. Some develop a sandpaper-like rash which is known as scarlet fever. Symptoms typically begin one to three days after exposure and last seven to ten days.|$|E
5|$|The {{juvenile}} pied butcherbird has {{dark brown}} instead of black plumage, lacks the pale collar {{and has a}} cream to buff lores, chin, and upper <b>throat,</b> becoming more brown on the lower <b>throat</b> and breast. Its underparts are off-white to cream. The bill is dark brown. In its first year, it moults into its first immature plumage, which resembles that of the juvenile, but has a more extensive dark brown <b>throat.</b> Its bill is blue-grey with a dark brown or blackish tip.|$|E
50|$|However, bright colored <b>throats</b> {{also give}} the lizards a fitness {{advantage}} because the bright colored <b>throats</b> attract more females, and therefore those males {{are more likely}} to reproduce. Although the bright colored <b>throats</b> increases the likelihood of being eaten by predators, it also increases their sexual success. Therefore, the prevalence of bright colored <b>throats</b> is maintained in this population of lizards. Based on the conflicting benefits of dull and bright colored <b>throats,</b> it is understandable that both morphs have been maintained in this species. Both traits give the lizards a different evolutionary advantage.|$|R
25|$|In {{children}} {{meeting the}} strict criteria for surgery, short term benefit means that without tonsillectomy {{a child who}} meets these strict criteria will probably have 6 sore <b>throats</b> {{in the next two}} years while one who has surgery will probably have 3 sore <b>throats.</b> After two years there is little difference in the frequency of sore <b>throats.</b>|$|R

5|$|The rapid strep test (RST) is a rapid antigen {{detection}} test (RADT) that {{is widely}} used in clinics {{to assist in the}} diagnosis of bacterial pharyngitis caused by group A streptococci (GAS), sometimes termed strep <b>throat.</b> There are currently several types of rapid strep test in use, each employing a distinct technology.

5|$|Balaenopterids are the rorquals. These animals, {{along with}} the cetotheriids, rely on their <b>throat</b> pleats to gulp large amounts of water while feeding. The <b>throat</b> pleats extend from the mouth to the navel and allow the mouth to expand to a large volume for more {{efficient}} capture of the small animals they feed on.

Deep <b>Throat</b> felt that the truth the Syndicate kept secret from the public needed to be known, and believed Mulder to be the one person capable of exposing this knowledge. However, during the disappearance of Max Fenig, Deep <b>Throat</b> provided Mulder with false information in order to divert him, later explaining that he believed the public was just not ready to know some truths.|$|E

50|$|The <b>throating</b> issue exists {{because in}} the USA it has been {{traditional}} to have short chambers so that the bullet is being engraved {{at the moment of}} insertion. European practice has more of a forcing cone construction which can, by itself, allow significantly higher chamber pressure. All Sig-Sauer handguns (for example) have European <b>throating</b> and all are certified to fire +P ammunition. Short <b>throating</b> and unnoticed bullet setback can easily increase chamber pressures by more than 10,000 psi.|$|R
30|$|CalcRelPerm first calculates the fluids {{conductance}} of pores and <b>throats.</b> Then, using Poiseuille equation, {{the pressure}} in the pores and the flow rate of each phase in the <b>throats</b> are obtained. After that, the total outflow rate of each phase is calculated by summation of the flow rates of that phase {{in all of the}} <b>throats</b> connected to the network outlet. Finally, the outflow rates of the water and oil phases are put in Darcy’s equation to get the effective and relative permeabilities.|$|R

40|$|Biomass {{plugging}} of porous media finds {{application in}} enhanced oil recovery and bioremediation. An understanding of biomass plugging of porous media was sought {{by using a}} porous glass micromodel through which biomass and nutrient were passed. This study describes the pore-scale physics of biomass plug propagation of Leuconostoc mesenteroides under nutrient-rich conditions. It was found that, as the nutrient flowed through the micromodel, the initial biomass plug occurred at the nutrient–inoculum interface due to growth in the larger pore <b>throats.</b> As growth proceeded, biomass filled and closed these larger pore <b>throats,</b> until only isolated groupings of pore <b>throats</b> with smaller radii remained empty. As nutrient flow continued, a maximum pressure drop was reached. At the maximum pressure drop, the biomass yielded {{in a manner similar}} to a Bingham plastic to form a breakthrough channel consisting of a path of interconnected pore <b>throats.</b> The channel incorporated the isolated groupings of empty pore <b>throats</b> that had been present before breakthrough. As the nutrient flow continued, subsequent plugs developed as breakthrough channels refilled with biomass and in situ growth was stimulated in the region just downstream of the previous plug. The downstream plugs had a higher fraction of isolated groupings of empty pore <b>throats,</b> which can be attributed to depletion of nutrient downstream. When the next breakthrough channel formed, it incorporated these isolated groupings, causing the breakthrough channels to be branched. It was observed that the newly formed plug could be less stable with this higher fraction of empty pore <b>throats</b> and that the location of breakthrough channels changed in subsequent plugs. This change in breakthrough channel location could be attributed to the redistribution of nutrient flow and the changes in flowrate in the pore <b>throats.</b> © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

30|$|Void {{space and}} solid grains (non-void regions) {{constitute}} the porous medium. We {{suppose that the}} void space is not a continuum medium distributed over the entire rock in the pore-scale modeling approach. The pore-scale models classify the void space into pores, or pore bodies, and pore <b>throats,</b> and then investigate the interactions between the pores. The interactions between the pores occur through the pore <b>throats,</b> which are often considered the narrowest region of the void space between two neighboring pores. The spatial distribution of the <b>throats</b> and their characteristic size control the transport properties.|$|R

40|$|This brief review {{discusses}} the existence conditions of wormhole <b>throats</b> and wormholes as global configurations in general relativity under {{the assumptions of}} cylindrical and axial symmetries.

5|$|The common cold, {{also known}} simply as a cold, is a viral {{infectious}} disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose. The <b>throat,</b> sinuses, and larynx may also be affected. Signs and symptoms may begin less than two days following exposure. They include coughing, sore <b>throat,</b> runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days. Some symptoms may last up to three weeks. In those with other health problems, pneumonia may occasionally develop.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between viral {{upper respiratory tract}} infections is loosely based on the location of symptoms with the common cold affecting primarily the nose, pharyngitis the <b>throat,</b> and bronchitis the lungs. However, there can be significant overlap and multiple areas can be affected. The common cold is frequently defined as nasal inflammation with varying amount of <b>throat</b> inflammation. Self-diagnosis is frequent. Isolation of the viral agent involved is rarely performed, and it is generally not possible to identify the virus type through symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The female {{is similar}} in some ways to the male, but paler and duller. It is sandy grey or brown, with a back {{patterned}} like that of the male, and white or whitish underparts. The head of the females of the subspecies ammodendri and nigricans is dingy grey with darker smudges on the forehead, behind its eyes, and on its <b>throat.</b> The female of the subspecies stoliczkae is buff-brown with a white <b>throat,</b> a conspicuous pale supercilium, darker forehead, and lighter cheeks. The juvenile is similar to the female, differing in its lack of dark tinges on its <b>throat</b> and crown. In adults, moulting begins in July and ends in late August or early September. The post-juvenile moult is complete, and occurs variously from June to August.|$|E
