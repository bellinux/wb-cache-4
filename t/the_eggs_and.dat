5|$|Many {{woodland}} salamanders lay {{clutches of}} eggs under dead logs or stones on land. The black mountain salamander (Desmognathus welteri) does this, the mother brooding <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> guarding them from predation as the embryos {{feed on the}} yolks of their eggs. When fully developed, they break {{their way out of}} the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders. The male hellbender, a primitive salamander, excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there. The male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch, using body undulations to fan <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> increase their supply of oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Parental care {{is found}} in a few species of beetle, perhaps for {{protection}} against adverse conditions and predators. The rove beetle Bledius spectabilis lives in salt marshes, so <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> larvae are endangered by the rising tide. The maternal beetle patrols <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> larvae, burrowing {{to keep them from}} flooding and asphyxiating, and protects them from the predatory carabid beetle Dicheirotrichus gustavi and from the parasitoidal wasp Barycnemis blediator, which kills some 15% of the larvae.|$|E

40|$|The {{sea urchin}} major yolk protein (MYP) is {{localized}} in nutritive phagocytes in the testis and ovary, {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> coelomic fluid of the adult sea urchin. We and others have shown that <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> MYP can drive calcium-dependent, membrane-membrane interactions. However, much less {{is known about the}} coelomic fluid-localized MYP. Therefore, we have begun a comparative biochemical analysis of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> coelomic fluid MYPs. Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation revealed unique elution profiles for the MYP species present in <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> coelomic fluid. Under reducing conditions, there were two species of MYP both in <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> coelomic fluid. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> coelomic fluid MYPs under reducing and non-reducing conditions revealed that under reducing conditions, there are two species in each fraction, 170 - nad 240 kDa in <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> 180 - and 250 kDa in the coelomic fluid. However, under non-reducing conditions only one species is present in each fraction, 240 kDa in <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> 250 kDa in the coelomic fluid. In addition, V 8 protease peptide mapping showed that all four polypeptide species have very similar primary structures. Further analysis with circular dichroism (CD) revealed that the purified 170 - and 180 kDa species possess different secondary structural features. Endogenous tryptophan fluorescence measurements in the presence of different concentrations of calcium showed a notable difference in apparent dissociation constants (calcium); 245 - and 475 μM for <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> coelomic fluid MYPs, respectively. Interestingly, there was no notable difference in the apparent dissociation constants for zinc. Additional assays revealed that both the 170 - and 180 kDa species have different calcium requirements for binding to liposomal membranes, with an apparent dissociation constants (calcium) of 10 - and 290 μM for the 170 - and 180 kDa species, respectively. In addition, both the 170 - and 180 kDa species have different calcium requirement to induce vesicular aggregation, which is correlated with the calcium induced tertiary structural change in both polypeptides. Collectively, these results identify structural differences between <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> coelomic fluid MYPs which may reflect different functional capabilities between these species...|$|R

5|$|Although the {{population}} of emus on mainland Australia {{is thought to be}} higher now than it was before European settlement, some local populations are at risk of extinction. The threats faced by emus include the clearance and fragmentation of areas of suitable habitat, deliberate slaughter, collisions with vehicles and predation of <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> young.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} may also show {{versatility}} in its diet. On islands with seabird colonies, it will prey on <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> chicks of terns and other seabirds. During migration {{it has also}} been reported to eat exhausted migrating landbirds. Birds of the Seychelles race also indulge in some kleptoparasitism, chasing the chicks of sooty terns and forcing them to disgorge food.|$|E

5|$|The female kakapo lays 1 or 2 eggs (rarely 3) per {{breeding}} cycle, {{with long}} intervals between laying of {{first and second}} eggs. She nests on the ground {{under the cover of}} plants or in cavities such as hollow tree trunks. The female incubates the eggs faithfully, but is forced to leave them every night in search of food. Predators are known to eat <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> the embryos inside can also die of cold in the mother's absence. Kakapo eggs usually hatch within 30days, bearing fluffy grey chicks that are quite helpless. After the eggs hatch, the female feeds the chicks for three months, and the chicks remain with the female for some months after fledging. The young chicks are just as vulnerable to predators as <b>the</b> <b>eggs,</b> <b>and</b> young have been killed by many of the same predators that attack adults. Chicks leave the nest at approximately 10 to 12weeks of age. As they gain greater independence, their mothers may feed the chicks sporadically for up to 6months.|$|E

5|$|A small species, the Inaccessible Island rail has brown plumage {{and a black}} {{bill and}} feet. It {{occupies}} most habitats on Inaccessible Island, from the beaches to the central plateau, feeding {{on a variety of}} small invertebrates and also some plant matter. Pairs are territorial and monogamous, with both parents being responsible for incubating <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> raising the chicks. Its adaptations to living on a tiny island at high densities include low base metabolic rates, small clutch sizes, and flightlessness.|$|E
5|$|About forty {{days after}} mating, the female giant Pacific octopus {{attaches}} strings of small fertilised eggs (10,000 to 70,000 in total) to rocks in a crevice or under an overhang. Here she guards and cares for them {{for about five}} months (160 days) until they hatch. In colder waters, such as those off of Alaska, it may take as much as 10 months for the eggs to completely develop. The female aerates <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> keeps them clean; if left untended, many eggs will not hatch. She does not feed during this time and dies soon afterwards. Males become senescent and die {{a few weeks after}} mating.|$|E

After Bart spends more time in his treehouse, Marge starts to suspect he is up to something. After Marge finds out what Bart has been doing, she tells him she is proud of him. With Marge's help, the eggs eventually hatch, but the Simpson family is shocked when instead of birds, a pair of lizards emerge from the eggs, whom Bart names Chirpy Boy and Bart Jr.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all species}} are hermaphrodites, {{in other words}} each {{individual}} can function as both male and female. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time, while others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> sperm mature at different times. The gonads {{are located in the}} parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows, and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis. Fertilization is generally external, but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch. Self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis, and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels are cavity nesters, {{but they}} are able to adapt {{to a wide variety of}} nesting situations. They {{generally}} prefer natural cavities (such as in trees) with closed tops and tight fitting entrances, as to provide for maximum protection of <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> young. Kestrels occasionally nest in holes created by large woodpeckers, or use the abandoned nests of other birds, such as red-tailed hawks, merlins, and crows. They have been recorded nesting on cliff ledges and building tops, as well as in abandoned cavities in cactuses. American kestrels also commonly utilize nesting boxes.|$|E

5|$|Because adult great spotted kiwis {{are large}} and powerful, {{they are able to}} fend off most predators that attack them, such as stoats, ferrets, weasels, pigs, brush possums and cats, all of which are {{invasive}} species in New Zealand. However, dogs are able to kill even adults. Stoats, ferrets, possums, cats and dogs will feed on <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> chicks, meaning most chicks die within their first five months of life. Before the arrival of mammalian predators, the great spotted kiwi's natural predators would have been birds of prey like the extinct Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier and the extant Swamp harrier.|$|E
5|$|Brood {{parasitism}} demonstrates close coevolution of {{host and}} parasite, {{for example in}} cuckoos. These birds do not make their own nests, but lay their eggs in nests of other species, ejecting or killing <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> young of the host and thus having a strong {{negative impact on the}} host's reproductive fitness. Their eggs are camouflaged as eggs of their hosts, implying that hosts can distinguish their own eggs from those of intruders and are in an evolutionary arms race with the cuckoo between camouflage and recognition. Cuckoos are counter-adapted to host defences with features such as thickened eggshells, shorter incubation (so their young hatch first), and flat backs adapted to lift eggs out of the nest.|$|E
5|$|Burrowing seabirds such as petrels, prions, and shearwaters {{share the}} tuatara's island habitat during the birds' nesting seasons. The tuatara use the birds' burrows for shelter when available, or dig their own. The seabirds' guano helps to {{maintain}} invertebrate populations on which tuatara predominantly prey; including beetles, crickets, and spiders. Their diets also consist of frogs, lizards, and bird's eggs and chicks. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> young of seabirds that are seasonally available as food for tuatara may provide beneficial fatty acids. Tuatara {{of both sexes}} defend territories, and will threaten and eventually bite intruders. The bite can cause serious injury. Tuatara will bite when approached, and will not let go easily.|$|E
