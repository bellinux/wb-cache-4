40|$|Demand {{studies of}} {{professional}} team sports have traditionally focused on stadium attendance; however, advances in broadcasting mean that teams generate revenue from stadium goers and broadcasters alike. Previous studies of demand {{have focused on}} stadium attendance and <b>television</b> <b>audiences,</b> but none have assessed the demand for match-day attendances and demand by <b>television</b> <b>audiences</b> jointly. This study models match-day attendances and <b>television</b> <b>audiences</b> using data from tier-two of English league football. It shows that while televised matches depress stadium attendances, ceteris paribus, {{there is an important}} feedback in that larger stadium attendances have positive impacts on the size of <b>television</b> <b>audiences.</b> Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
