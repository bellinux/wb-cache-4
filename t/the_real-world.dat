5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} designed {{as part of}} the Dizzy series, with a working title of Movieland Dizzy, but the creators of Dizzy disagreed with <b>the</b> <b>real-world</b> direction the game had taken, despite it being 90% complete. The developers, Big Red Software, were given 12 weeks to create a new game with a different character. Seymour was adapted from Dizzy, with a new shape and fingers to differentiate the two.|$|E
5|$|After the Hollywood {{theme was}} decided on, the design team {{drew up a}} map and {{assigned}} objects and puzzles to different areas. The game was originally designed for the ZX Spectrum and then ported to the Amstrad CPC, due to the systems' similar architecture. However, the team struggled to port the game to the Commodore 64 due to it being a different machine altogether. The finished game is significantly changed from the incomplete Movieland Dizzy, which featured only film sets as locations, the surrounding film studio and backlots were not present. <b>The</b> <b>real-world</b> studio elements were added after Dizzy was disassociated from the game.|$|E

The academic Jeremy Black points to the 1951 defections of two members of MI6—Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean—to the Soviet Union as having a major impact on how Britain was poorly viewed in US intelligence circles; Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, but he did not focus on it too strongly, and Bond and Leiter's warm relationship did not reflect the reality of the US-UK relationship.|$|E

The relationships built up by the player triggered special character interactions during the final chapter. Agito featured sub-missions, the game's version of side-quests, some of which changed depending on <b>the</b> <b>real-world</b> day of the week. They were given by NPCs, and could range from crafting new spells and equipment to performing certain actions within a combat mission. Completing quests yielded rewards such as new equipment and items.|$|E
5|$|While the game's cutscenes are {{animated}} with 3D graphics, {{the team}} recorded live-action videos to introduce <b>the</b> <b>real-world</b> skateboarding teams, so that players could better understand each team before selecting one to join. Neversoft interviewed professional skaters {{about their experiences}} of becoming known in the skateboarding world, then compiled elements of these stories into the game's script. Every skater who appears in the plot helped to craft their own scenes and voiced their own character.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} co-written by Nanase Ohkawa and Junichi Fujisaku, who also {{worked on the}} series. According to Fujisaku, the {{narrative}} of The Last Dark focused on Saya both seeking revenge and searching for purpose after discovering she was being used by cruel humans. The process of writing The Last Dark ran parallel to Blood-C, and as Ohkawa was preoccupied with the series, Fujisaku put together a basic story and script draft which he expanded and adjusted based on Shiotani's desires for the movie. When Ohkawa, she and Fujisaku together worked to write and polish the final script. Saya's relationships with others despite her non-human status formed {{a key part of}} the movie's themes. According to Ohkawa, one of her main issues was keeping the storytelling as tight as possible within the movie's planned runtime, meaning that some elements of Saya's backstory needed to be cut. While the series took place in a fictional location, the movie used <b>the</b> <b>real-world</b> location of Tokyo, so Ohkawa took extra care to insert realistic details into the script. She found it difficult accommodating the wishes of both Shiotani and Fujisaku's ideas alongside her own in the script.|$|E

5|$|The game's setting, Kyrat, is {{a fictional}} {{country in the}} Himalayas region. When {{building}} Kyrat, the developers merged elements from real-world regions including Nepal and Tibet, but exaggerated those elements. The map's size {{is similar to that}} of Far Cry 3, but is more dense, diverse, and features more varied environments. The developers hoped that players could experience a sense of exploration when traveling between the different terrains. The team also hoped that the new location could be believable, while remaining interesting for players. As a result, they created an identify for Kyrat by doing such things as adding different signboards to the game and creating a fictional mythology and religion for Kyrat. The game's world was also designed to accommodate new features such as the helicopter and the grappling hook. In an effort to make the world feel real, the team added improvements to the design of side-quests. Instead of simply being activities for players to complete, the quests are narrative-driven, which was done to increase the connection between them and the world. In order to increase the credibility of the game's world, the studio sent a team to Nepal to experience and record the local culture, so that they could bring those ideas back to the studio. According to the developer, the trip changed the game's design; the focus shifted from the game's civil war, which is inspired by <b>the</b> <b>real-world</b> Nepalese Civil War, to developing unique and interesting characters.|$|E
5|$|The team {{decided to}} stay with {{two-dimensional}} graphics instead of three-dimensional graphics, believing it would help differentiate themselves from other Square Enix titles as well as better represent their vision for the game. When first approached {{with the task of}} creating the art for the game, background art director Takayuki Ohdachi thought the modern-day setting would be too boring, and opted to use highly skewed and angular images of Shibuya to avoid this; the rest of the creative team found this approach to fit the game quite well. For combat, the background of the top screen was selected for visual interest, while the bottom touchscreen background was designed to emphasize the gameplay. Ohdachi was also responsible for the artwork for the psych pins, and used a mix of pop art and tribal designs for the various graphics. Character designs were handled by Tetsuya Nomura and Gen Kobayashi. Character designs were made to match with <b>the</b> <b>real-world</b> Tokyo setting, after which their outfits were designed based on the character's personality. Kobayashi was also in charge of designing the game's non-player characters and noted how most designs made it to the final product. Hasegawa was responsible for creating the designs for the Noise creatures, and wanted to have them recognizable as creatures before they decay into skeletons. In keeping with the theme of human emotion in the game, Hasegawa selected creatures that conveyed such feelings, such as wolves and crows. Representation of the Noise in the game required drawing the 2D sprites from several angles to match the action on screen as well as using rotoscoping on pre-rendered sprites, and took several iterations between Square Enix and Jupiter {{to make sure that the}} sprites' art matched the style of game, with Kando making the two-hour trip between Tokyo and Kyoto weekly to check on the progress.|$|E
