5|$|A 1951 letter {{showed that}} Bradner clearly {{understood}} that <b>the</b> <b>insulation</b> {{in such a}} suit was not provided by the water between the suit and the skin, but rather that this layer of water next to the skin, if trapped, would quickly heat to skin temperature, if the material in the suit were insulative. Thus, the suit only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water, {{and it did not}} need to be dry to work. He applied for a U.S. patent for the wetsuit, but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with the flight suit. The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the neoprene in the wetsuits might make its swimmers easier to spot by underwater sonar and, thus, could not exclusively profit from his invention.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, 1975, a three-alarm fire {{broke out}} on the 11th floor of the North Tower.

Most of the damage was on the 11th floor, where the fire was fueled by cabinets filled with paper, alcohol-based fluid for office machines, and other office equipment. Fireproofing protected the steel, and there was no structural damage to the tower. In addition to the fire damage on the 9th and 14th floors, water used to extinguish the fire damaged a few floors below. At the time, the World Trade Center complex had no fire sprinkler systems.|$|E

5|$|The {{advancing}} and retreating {{characteristics of}} the glaciers in the Glacier Bay are explained in simple terms as a steady state of snow getting converted into ice on the hills. Ice, as a lens {{of water on the}} base of bedrock, slides by gravity downwards. The good moraine of rock and rubble insulates it from water erosion. As a result, during freezing temperatures that exists all the year, the glacier advances. When <b>the</b> <b>insulation</b> and erosion effect of the hills gets reduced erosion sets in and along with rising temperatures the glaciers start retreating. Another unpredictable phenomenon that is observed in many glaciers in the Glacier Bay is that of calving. Calving is a process in which blocks of ice get detached or break off from the glacier, irrespective of weather conditions, all the year round, and crash into the sea with thundering noise creating a boiling like turbulence.|$|E

40|$|Measurement {{uncertainty}} {{is an important}} topic in building acoustics measurements {{carried out in the}} field assessing <b>the</b> sound <b>insulation</b> between rooms as well as conducted in test stands characterizing <b>the</b> sound <b>insulation</b> properties of a building element accurately. Beyond measurement method related contributions to the uncertainty budget there is the variation of <b>the</b> sound <b>insulation</b> properties of <b>the</b> building element itself. According to several studies conducted in the past this uncertainty due to the building element properties can be of a significant quantity.
