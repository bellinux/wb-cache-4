5|$|Rough seas {{offshore}} Odisha caused two fishing <b>trawlers</b> to collide, {{resulting in}} 18fatalities, while two additional <b>trawlers</b> were reported missing. In West Bengal, the storm uprooted trees and dropped heavy rainfall. Throughout India, 124deaths were confirmed. Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Bangladesh impacted many cities and villages, including {{the capital city}} of Dhaka, forcing thousands to evacuate. Ten wooden <b>trawlers</b> carrying 150men sank offshore Bangladesh, with only 11reaching safety. Eight additional boats with 60occupants were reported missing. One death was reported in Bangladesh after a man attempted to cross a swollen river. Overall, there were 49fatalities in Bangladesh. The storm was attributed to at least 173fatalities in India, Bangladesh, and offshore areas.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Kriegsmarine planned Operation Wikinger in {{cooperation}} with the Luftwaffe in the erroneous belief that the British fishing <b>trawlers</b> off the Dogger Bank were cooperating with submarines. They believed that sinking or capturing the <b>trawlers</b> would force the British to spread themselves thin to defend the fishing fleet and might result in some useful auxiliary ships for the Kriegsmarine. The Luftwaffe promised fighter cover for the ships engaged in the operation as well as bomber support.|$|E
5|$|Over 3 million {{vessels are}} {{employed}} in sea fishing. Modern fishing vessels include fishing <b>trawlers</b> with a small crew, stern <b>trawlers,</b> purse seiners, long-line factory vessels, and large factory ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets, and long-lines. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide food security to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty.|$|E

After running the <b>trawler</b> aground the PCFs managed to hit it with several mortar rounds while Point Gammon kept the <b>trawler</b> illuminated. Several secondary explosions occurred and the <b>trawler</b> disappeared. Investigations later concluded that the <b>trawler</b> could have successfully escaped to a nearby river although heavily damaged.|$|R
5|$|The {{flotilla}} {{was next}} in action {{during the night}} 29/30 July again off Ostend, when the flotilla in company with two Motor Torpedo Boats (MTB) engaged a convoy of three Flak <b>trawlers</b> and two merchant ships. One of the merchant ships was hit by torpedoes from the MTBs while the MGBs engaged the other by dropping depth charges. With those ships destroyed they then engaged the Flak <b>trawlers.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} approached, {{residents}} of low-lying areas were advised to seek shelter. According to the Odisha State Disaster Management Authority, the communication system had been activated and collectors in coastal districts were given satellite telephones. Additionally, district authorities collected food, water, and other essential emergency supplies. Offshore Odisha, rough seas caused two <b>trawlers</b> to collide, resulting in 18fatalities; {{their bodies were}} later found floating Dhamra Port in the Bhadrak district of Odisha. Two additional <b>trawlers</b> were reported missing. Nine fishing <b>trawlers</b> sank offshore West Bengal, with only 66fishermen accounted for. Initially, as many as 600were estimated to have been missing, though 250people swam back to Digha, where most of them received treatment at either a medical clinic or a hospital. According to the Chief Minister of West Bengal, 111people were still missing offshore West Bengal by late on November12. Forty-nine fatalities were confirmed offshore India, while two deaths occurred inland in West Bengal. Later, the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters raised the death toll to 124.|$|E

2500|$|Forty {{miles from}} Chu Lai and six {{miles off the}} coast, (map {{reference}} #3) USCGC Androscoggin intercepted a third <b>trawler</b> designated in U.S. Navy records as the Quảng Ngãi Province <b>Trawler.</b> Androscoggin signaled the <b>trawler</b> to identify itself at 0112 {{but there was no}} response so Androscoggin shot 5-inch star shells into the air to illuminate the <b>trawler.</b> It was then that the <b>trawler</b> was positively identified as an SL class North Vietnamese <b>trawler</b> so the Androscoggin opened fire at 0120 with 5-inch high explosive naval gunfire and [...]50 caliber machine guns. The <b>trawler</b> returned fire with a recoilless rifle, laid a smoke screen and turned into Androscoggins direction but one of the cutter's shells hit the after starboard side, so the <b>trawler</b> turned reversed course and headed for the shore. As a result of a civilian junk passing through the battle area the Market Time ships had to cease fire. Two United States Army helicopters were directed engage the <b>trawler</b> with rockets and miniguns at 0129 and after their attack a reduction in the amount of fire coming from the <b>trawler</b> was noticed. [...] At 0140 Point Grey, Point Welcome, PCF-18 and PCF-20 were ordered to take the <b>trawler</b> under fire with mortars and machine guns at close range because the <b>trawler</b> had moved too close to shore for Androscoggin to maneuver. Point Welcome struck the <b>trawler</b> twice with 81-millimeter rounds. The <b>trawler</b> then grounded 50 yards off the mouth of the Tha Cau River at 0210. At 0220, the North Vietnamese tried to scuttle their ship and failed but a second attempt at 0235 succeeded in destroying the vessel in a 500 foot fireball. The explosion caused some damage to the pilothouse of Point Welcome and the deck was littered with debris but no casualties were reported.|$|R

5|$|During {{an action}} on 1 March 1968, {{in the early}} morning several Squadron One cutters were {{involved}} in the interdiction and destruction of four North Vietnamese <b>trawlers</b> attempting to smuggle arms and ammunition into South Vietnam at different locations. This co-ordinated attempt by the North Vietnamese was met by various elements of TF115; including U.S. Navy aircraft and vessels, RVN junks, U.S. Air Force aircraft, and U.S. Army helicopters. In addition, there were several Owasco-class cutter cutters from Coast Guard Squadron Three– , , and – as well as Point Grey, Point Hudson, and Point Welcome from Squadron One. As a result of this action, three North Vietnamese <b>trawlers</b> were destroyed and a fourth was turned back before it could reach the coast. After this action the incidence of smuggling by trawler was decreased and Communist forces had to resort to shipments along the Ho Chi Minh trail or through the port of Sihanoukville in Cambodia.|$|E
25|$|Any fish {{processing}} usually occurs in deck houses or below deck. A wet fish stern <b>trawler</b> stores {{the fish in}} ice or sea water which has been refrigerated. A freezer stern <b>trawler</b> stores the fish in frozen boxes or blocks, and a factory stern <b>trawler</b> processes the catch. A pelagic stern <b>trawler</b> may use fish pumps to empty the codend.|$|R
50|$|A Coast Guard Motor Lifeboat Crew had {{proceeded}} to the fishing <b>trawler</b> Sea King in motor lifeboat 44381, because the <b>trawler</b> had lost power off the Columbia bar, and was taking on water.

50|$|On September 5, 1972, at 10:25 ICGV Ægir, under Cdr. Guðmundur Kjærnested's command, {{encountered}} {{an unmarked}} <b>trawler</b> fishing northeast of Hornbanki. The master of this black-hulled <b>trawler</b> refused to divulge the <b>trawler's</b> name and number, and, after being warned {{to follow the}} Coast Guard's orders, played Rule, Britannia! over the radio. At 10:40 the net cutter was deployed into the water {{for the first time}} and Ægir sailed along the <b>trawler's</b> port side. The fishermen tossed a thick nylon rope into the water as the patrol ship closed in, attempting to disable its propeller. After passing the <b>trawler,</b> Ægir veered to the <b>trawler's</b> starboard side. The net cutter, 160 fathom m behind the patrol vessel, sliced one of the trawling wires. As ICGV Ægir came about to circle the unidentified <b>trawler,</b> its angry crew threw coal as well as garbage and a large fire axe at the Coast Guard vessel. A considerable amount of swearing and shouting came through the radio, which resulted in the <b>trawler</b> being identified as Peter Scott (H103).|$|R
50|$|According to an Argentine {{statement}} the <b>trawler</b> Chi-Fu 6 {{was detected}} {{fishing in the}} Argentine zone at 11:45, but she took refuge in the British zone. At 18:25 the <b>trawler</b> Chian-der 3 was spotted again within the Argentine zone of 200 nmi mi. Despite requests to stop and warning shots being fired by Prefecto Derbes, the <b>trawler</b> escaped and was chased. At 21:05 the Argentine commander stated that {{he saw that the}} <b>trawler</b> stopped and emitting smoke from the engine room. He ordered the rescue of the <b>trawler's</b> crew.

Another member of the crew became missing.|$|R
5|$|Hichens {{was next}} {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} 8th MGB Flotilla. These new boats were armed with a twin Oerlikon mount aft, a QF 2-pounder Mark XIV forward, twin Lewis or later twin Vickers machine guns {{either side of the}} bridge and depth charges. The flotilla was moved to Dartmouth, Devon in July 1942. The first action they were involved in was during the night of 14/15 July. Ordered to engage E Boats using Cherbourg as a base they found a convoy of naval <b>trawlers</b> escorting a small tanker. The flotilla engaged the two rear escort <b>trawlers</b> and carried out a depth charge attack. The tanker was last seen to be on fire as the flotilla reformed off Alderney. After this action Hichens was awarded a Bar to his DSO. Both the DSO and the Bar were presented during the same investiture at Buckingham Palace on 22 September 1942, while other members of the flotilla were awarded a Conspicuous Gallantry Medal and four MIDs for the action.|$|E
5|$|Like most corvettes, Fredericton was {{installed}} with a Type 123A ASDIC detection system. This technology was designed in 1934 for armed <b>trawlers</b> and minesweepers of the Royal Navy.

5|$|Off South Africa, {{the round}} ribbontail ray is {{captured}} incidentally by prawn <b>trawlers</b> on offshore banks, {{but is not}} utilized. Because of its size and strength, it is also prized by sport anglers, who usually release it unharmed. South Africa sets a recreational bag limit of one ray per species per person per day, and does not allow spearfishing for this species. In Australian waters, this ray has been assessed as of Least Concern. Although it is caught (and discarded) by prawn <b>trawlers,</b> this mortality has been reduced by the mandatory installation of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs). Furthermore, a portion of its Australian range lies within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. This species has also been listed under Least Concern in the Maldives where, due to the tourist value of rays, the government has created protected marine reserves and banned the export of rays in 1995 and ray skins in 1996.|$|E
