25|$|The future General Paul Huard, {{who served}} under de Gaulle at this time, {{recorded}} {{how he would}} often stand {{on a piece of}} high ground, keeping other officers literally at six yards’ distance, subjecting his subordinates to harsh criticism and taking all decisions autocratically himself, behaviour consistent with his later conduct as a political leader. Lacouture points out that for all his undoubted energy and physical courage there is no evidence in his brief period of command that he possessed the “hunter’s eye” of the great battlefield commander, and <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> single one of his officers joined him in London, although some joined the Resistance in France.|$|E
25|$|Barbara Stanwyck asked Jack L. Warner to buy {{the rights}} to the book for her. Warner Bros. {{purchased}} the film rights to Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead in late 1943, asking Rand to write the screenplay. Rand agreed, on the condition <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> single word of her dialogue be changed. The Fountainhead went into production, with Mervyn LeRoy hired to direct, but the production was delayed. LeRoy said that the delay {{was the result of the}} influence of the War Production Board, spurred by Rand's anti-Russian politics. Stanwyck was not told of the decision to cast Neal in the role she coveted until she read about it in the Hollywood trade papers. This led to her leaving Warner Bros.|$|E

25|$|The city {{continued}} to experience more {{conflict with the}} local LGBTQ community in 2016 with an appeal from a resident and her partner to include same-sex relationships {{as part of the}} school division's lessons around family diversity, this was rejected. Later that year a request from a lesbian student was put in to for diversity policies to better include LGBT people in the school division. The city gained national attention again based on the school division's response to the request after it too was denied. These events led to the announcement of the city's first Steinbach Pride parade. While initially expecting about 200 people, approximately 3,000 people attended the event. This was brought about in part from the fact <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> single elected official from the area attended or endorsed the event.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{played only}} two matches in the 1923/24 season {{prior to the}} South Africa tour of England in 1924. His form {{at the start of}} the tour was poor, in 11 matches before the first Test, he scored just two fifties in 18 innings. In the first Test at Edgbaston he scored 7 and 34, however his first innings was the top score for South Africa as they were {{dismissed}} for 30 in 12.3 overs. It equalled the record for the lowest Test total, the previous score of 30 also set by South Africa against England. It was also the only occasion in Test history <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> single batsman had reached double figures. Despite scoring 390 in the second innings they lost by an innings and 18 runs, the same margin of defeat followed in the second Test at Lord's where Taylor made scores of four and eight.|$|E
25|$|No {{official}} {{announcement of}} the actor's death was made, only a brief obituary appeared in the Moscow newspaper Vechernyaya Moskva, and a note informing of Vysotsky's death and cancellation of the Hamlet performance was put out {{at the entrance to}} the Taganka Theatre (the story goes <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> single ticket holder took advantage of the refund offer). Despite this, by the end of the day millions had learned of Vysotsky's death. On 28 July, he lay in state at the Taganka Theatre. After a mourning ceremony involving an unauthorized mass gathering of unprecedented scale, Vysotsky was buried at the Vagankovskoye Cemetery in Moscow. The attendance at the Olympic events dropped noticeably on that day, as scores of spectators left to attend the funeral. Tens of thousands of people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of his coffin.|$|E

25|$|One year later, eight {{criminal}} {{fraud charges}} were {{brought by the}} Chicago U. S. Attorney against Black and three former Hollinger executives. The U.S. Attorney laid four new charges against Black on 15 December 2005, alleging racketeering, obstruction of justice, money laundering, mail fraud, tax evasion and wire fraud. Under the racketeering count, the government sought forfeiture of more than $92,000,000 (USD). The obstruction count related to Black and his chauffeur removing boxes of documents from Hollinger offices in Toronto on June 9, 2005, contrary to a court order that prohibited removal. Black contested the obstruction count {{on the grounds that}} he was obeying an eviction notice, that he knew he was being filmed because he had installed the security cameras which filmed him, that he had already provided copies of every document prosecutors had asked for, and <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> single commercially relevant document in those boxes was not already possessed by prosecutors.|$|E

500|$|Himmler {{ordered the}} {{evacuation}} of all camps in January 1945, charging camp commanders with [...] "making sure <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> single prisoner from the concentration camps falls alive {{into the hands of}} the enemy." [...] On 17 January, 56,000–58,000 Auschwitz detainees, of whom two-thirds were Jews, were evacuated under guard, largely on foot, in severe winter conditions. Thousands of them died in the subsequent death march west towards Wodzisław Śląski. The guards shot all prisoners who were unable to march at the imposed pace. Peter Longerich estimates that a quarter of the detainees were thus killed. A column of inmates reached Gross-Rosen concentration camp complex. Throughout February, the terribly overcrowded main camp at Gross-Rosen was cleared, and all 44,000 inmates were moved further west. An unknown number died in this last journey. In March 1945, Himmler ordered that no more prisoners should be killed, as he hoped to use them as hostages in negotiations with the Allies. Approximately 20,000 Auschwitz prisoners made it to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany, where they were liberated by the British in April 1945.|$|E
500|$|Campbell {{attended}} the Alfred E. Smith Career and Technical Education High School in the Bronx, where his height, frame, and demeanor {{on the basketball}} court prompted the other kids to nickname him [...] "Hercules". He began running with a graffiti crew called the Ex-Vandals, taking the name Kool Herc. Herc recalls persuading his father to buy him a copy of [...] "Sex Machine" [...] by James Brown, a record <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> lot of his friends had, and which they would come to him to hear. He and his sister, Cindy, began hosting back-to-school parties in the recreation room of their building, 1520 Sedgwick Avenue.

With Bronx clubs struggling with street gangs, uptown DJs catering to an older disco crowd with different aspirations, and commercial radio also catering to a demographic distinct from teenagers in the Bronx, Herc's parties had a ready-made audience.|$|E
500|$|General Wilson {{described}} this unwillingness to retreat as [...] "the fetishistic doctrine <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> yard of ground should be yielded to the Italians." [...] Churchill also criticized the Greek Army commanders for ignoring British advice to abandon Albania and avoid encirclement. Lieutenant-General George Stumme's Fortieth Corps captured the Florina-Vevi Pass on 11 April, but unseasonal snowy weather then halted his advance. On 12 April, he resumed the advance, but {{spent the whole}} day fighting Brigadier Charrington's 1st Armoured Brigade at Proastion. It was not until 13 April that the first Greek elements began to withdraw toward the Pindus mountains. The Allies' retreat to Thermopylae uncovered a route across the Pindus mountains by which the Germans might flank the Hellenic army in a rearguard action. An elite SS formation—the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler brigade—was assigned the mission of cutting off the Greek Epirus Army's line of retreat from Albania by driving westward to the Metsovon pass {{and from there to}} Ioannina. On 13 April, attack aircraft from 21, 23 and 33 Squadrons from the Hellenic Air Force (RHAF), attacked Italian positions in Albania. That same day, heavy fighting took place at Kleisoura pass, where the Greek 20th Division covering the Greek withdrawal, fought in a determined manner, delaying Stumme's advance practically a whole day. The withdrawal extended across the entire Albanian front, with the Italians in hesitant pursuit. On 15 April, Regia Aeronautica fighters attacked the (RHAF) base at Paramythia, 30 miles south of Greece's border with Albania, destroying or putting out of action 17 VVKJ aircraft that had recently arrived from Yugoslavia.|$|E
