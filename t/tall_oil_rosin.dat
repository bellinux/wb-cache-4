50|$|There {{are three}} types of rosin: gum rosin (from pine tree oleoresin), wood rosin (obtained by {{extraction}} of tree stumps), and <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> <b>rosin</b> (obtained from tall oil, a byproduct of kraft paper process). Gum rosin has a milder odor and lower tendency to crystallize from solutions than wood rosin, and is therefore preferred for flux applications. <b>Tall</b> <b>oil</b> <b>rosin</b> finds increased use due to its higher thermal stability and therefore lower tendency to form insoluble thermal decomposition residues. The composition and quality of rosin differs by the tree type, and also by location and even by year.

30|$|Conventionally, crude {{tall oil}} (CTO) is {{obtained}} from the tall oil soap by adding sulfuric acid to liberate free fatty and resin acids [1]. The CTO is then further purified and fractionated by vacuum distillation to obtain several commercial fractions including tall oil fatty acids (TOFAs) (20 – 40  %), <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> <b>rosin</b> (TOR) (25 – 35  %), light oil (10 – 15  %), and pitch residue (20 – 30  %) [2 – 4]. The average yield of CTO is {{in the range of}} 30 – 50  kg/ton of pulp. In general, oleic (C 18 : 1) and linoleic (C 18 : 2) acids are the most significant fatty acid components in TOFAs.

40|$|Development {{of new and}} {{innovative}} products through efficient technologies {{is essential for the}} implementation of sustainable developments in highly competitive chemical industries. Based on this context, raw materials originating from biomass have been widely used for the production of chemicals and materials. Steam cracking of bio-based or renewable feedstocks in a conventional steam cracking set-up is identified as a promising approach for the sustainable production of base-chemicals. In a two-step process for the production of base-chemicals, firstly, bio-derived feedstock is upgraded into a more suitable feedstock which comprises mainly paraffin range hydrocarbons with a lower oxygen content than the original feedstock; secondly, the upgraded feedstock is converted into base-chemicals by conventional steam cracking technology. This research work identifies wood-derived <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> as a potential feedstock for the production of base-chemicals by catalytic upgrading and steam cracking methods. The main aim of this work was to carry out the catalytic hydrotreating of <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> feedstocks such as <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> fatty acid (TOFA), distilled <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> (DTO) and crude <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> (CTO) on a commercial, sulfided NiMo catalyst at different process conditions.

The results of studies of the effect of additives on the received technical and technological properties of the elastomer compositions, adhesion and corrosion resistance rubber-systems are presented. The most efficient promoters are metalcord-rubber adhesion systems for use in the manufacture of tires fitted. Providing the necessary technological properties of manufacturing rubber compounds achieved when using elastomeric compositions consisting of a cobalt salt of amide MTC.
