These photos would later be included in the game so that players could use them as their multiplayer profiles. Outrage also released two game demos <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> customers to try the game before purchasing it. The second demo included a single-player level and several multiplayer matches which could be played through a matchmaking service provided by Outrage. From March to August 1999, Interplay also held a Descent 3 tournament in the United States consisting of three phases where numerous players could compete against each other in multiplayer matches.
