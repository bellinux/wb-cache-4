5|$|In the past, {{quantities}} of hydrocarbons were greater. According to one source, {{in the period}} from 1751 to 2008 about 347 gigatonnes of carbon were released as carbon dioxide <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> from burning of fossil fuels. Another source puts the amount added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> for the period since 1750 at 879 Gt, and the total going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> sea, and land (such as peat bogs) at almost 2,000 Gt.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Venera 4 found Venus's {{magnetic}} field {{to be much}} weaker than that of Earth. This {{magnetic field}} is induced by an interaction between the ionosphere and the solar wind, rather than by an internal dynamo as in the Earth's core.

5|$|Open {{water is}} {{unrestricted}} water {{such as a}} sea, lake or flooded quarry, where the diver has direct vertical access {{to the surface of}} the water in contact with the atmosphere.

25|$|One {{theory is}} that periods of {{increased}} geomagnetic reversals will weaken Earth's magnetic field long enough <b>to</b> expose <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> solar winds, causing oxygen ions <b>to</b> escape <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> in a rate increased by 3–4 orders, resulting in a disastrous decrease in oxygen.|$|R

5|$|Frequent radio {{transmissions}} through the player's communications device also add <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> by broadcasting certain sounds and messages from non-player characters meant to unsettle the player. Early in the game, during and directly {{after the event}} that plunges the base into chaos, the player often hears the sounds of fighting, screaming and dying through their radio transmitter. The ambient sound is extended to the base itself through such things as hissing pipes, footsteps, and occasional jarringly loud noises from machinery or other sources. Often ambient sounds can be heard that resemble deep breathing, unexplained voices and demonic taunting from the game's antagonists.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 {{study by}} {{researchers}} at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography concluded that the imbalance between global dimming and global warming at the surface leads to weaker turbulent heat fluxes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> This means globally reduced evaporation and hence precipitation occur in a dimmer and warmer world, which could ultimately lead to a more humid atmosphere in which it rains less.|$|E

5|$|The {{station has}} two {{platforms}} positioned {{in a cutting}} partially covered with a glazed roof and partially exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> It was designed by John Fowler the MR's chief engineer. The brick-built street-level entrance building featured a balustrade {{along the edge of}} the roof decoratively topped with urns. Fowler's building was demolished and reconstructed to a design by the MR's architect Charles W Clark in 1914 with a cladding of white faïence blocks. The building is listed Grade II by Historic England. The brickwork of the platform retaining walls was restored in 1986 during a renovation of the station.|$|E
5|$|Xenon has {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 72% at age 40, making it 44% more potent than N2O as an anesthetic. Thus, {{it can be}} used with oxygen in concentrations that have a lower risk of hypoxia. Unlike nitrous oxide (N2O), xenon is not a greenhouse gas and is viewed as environmentally friendly. Though recycled in modern systems, xenon vented <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> is only returning to its original source, without environmental impact.|$|E
5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} {{fresh water}} {{is the result of}} precipitation that returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible {{in the northern part of}} Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike {{components}} toward the earth. At each tire contact patch there are ground reaction forces with both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on longitudinal stability below. The horizontal components, due to friction between the wheels and the ground, including rolling resistance, are in response to propulsive forces, braking forces, and turning forces. Aerodynamic forces due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from crosswinds. At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, aerodynamic drag is the largest force resisting forward motion. At faster speed, aerodynamic drag becomes overwhelmingly the largest force resisting forward motion.|$|E
5|$|Carbon-14 (C) is a {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope, {{created in the}} upper atmosphere (lower stratosphere and upper troposphere) by interaction of nitrogen with cosmic rays. It is found in trace amounts on Earth of up to 1 part per trillion (0.0000000001%), mostly confined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> and superficial deposits, particularly of peat and other organic materials. This isotope decays by 0.158MeV β emission. Because of its relatively short half-life of 5730years, C is virtually absent in ancient rocks. The amount of C in the atmosphere and in living organisms is almost constant, but decreases predictably in their bodies after death. This principle is used in radiocarbon dating, invented in 1949, which has been used extensively to determine the age of carbonaceous materials with ages up to about 40,000years.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's use of {{propaganda}} {{contributed to his}} rise to power, legitimated his régime, and established his image for posterity.

The propagandistic rhetoric changed in relation to events and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of Napoleon's reign, focusing first on his role as a general in the army and identification as a soldier, and moving to his role as emperor and a civil leader. Specifically targeting his civilian audience, Napoleon fostered a relationship with the contemporary art community, taking an active role in commissioning and controlling different forms of art production to suit his propaganda goals.|$|E

5|$|Saturn is a gas giant {{because it}} is {{predominantly}} composed of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite surface, though it may have a solid core. Saturn's rotation causes it to have {{the shape of an}} oblate spheroid; that is, it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator. Its equatorial and polar radii differ by almost 10%: 60,268km versus 54,364km. Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar System, are also oblate but to a lesser extent. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water—about 30% less. Although Saturn's core is considerably denser than water, the average specific density of the planet is 0.69g/cm3 due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Jupiter has 318 times the Earth's mass, and Saturn is 95 times the mass of the Earth. Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold 92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The {{reduction}} of sulphur emissions {{had been an}} important factor since the station was in the design stages, as {{it was one of}} the main worries of those who protested the construction of the station. The London Power Company began developing an experimental technique for washing the flue gases in 1925. It used water and alkaline sprays over scrubbers of steel and timber in the flue ducts. The gases were subject to continuous washing, and with the presence of the catalyst iron oxide, sulphur dioxide was converted into sulphuric acid. Battersea Power Station was one of the first commercial applications of this technique in the world. This method of washing was stopped in the B Station in the 1960s, when it was discovered that the discharge of these products into the Thames was more harmful to the river than the gases would be <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although The Human Centipede {{is set in}} Germany, {{principal}} photography {{took place}} in the Netherlands due to the neighboring countries' similar landscapes. Heiter's home, where most of The Human Centipede takes place, was a villa in the Netherlands found by the production team. The property was in a residential area and not surrounded by woodland as it appears in the film, but by other houses. This meant the filmmakers had some difficulty ensuring that the other houses did not appear in shot. Some conversion of the property took place prior to filming, for example, a cinema room was converted to form Heiter's basement operating theatre, with real hospital beds and intravenous drips rented from a local hospital. The paintings of conjoined twins that were displayed throughout the house were painted by Tom Six, which he felt contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> in the house. The hotel room scene near the beginning of the film was filmed in a hotel suite at a location near Amsterdam. The film was shot almost entirely in sequence, which Yennie stated helped the actors to develop their characters throughout the film. The opening scene, which only featured Laser and de Wit, was shot {{on the last day of}} filming.|$|E

5|$|Frogs {{are much}} more vocal, {{especially}} during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates. The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself. In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or {{at the corner of}} the mouth. This may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator, helping to transfer the sound <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> or the water at times when the animal is submerged. The main vocalisation is the male's loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory. This call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near. Calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy. Other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus. When a frog is attacked, a distress or fright call is emitted, often resembling a scream. The usually nocturnal Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours.|$|E
