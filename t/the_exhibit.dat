5|$|Burton {{fails to}} {{complete}} the revised Patient Zero exhibit before its scheduled opening date. The museum curator substitutes the original presentation instead over Burton's protests, leading to a renewed rush of press scapegoating Zero. The night after <b>the</b> <b>exhibit</b> opens, Mary and other ACT UP members break into the Hall of Contagion and trash <b>the</b> <b>exhibit.</b> Zero returns and Burton explains {{that he tried to}} stop <b>the</b> <b>exhibit.</b> Zero forgives Burton but says he wants to disappear again completely. Zero merges with his disfigured video image and, smoking a cigarette inside the video, sets off the fire alarm. The sprinklers destroy the video player and Zero vanishes.|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{the planned}} exhibit, {{especially}} those of the American Legion and the Air Force Association, charged that <b>the</b> <b>exhibit</b> focused too much attention on the Japanese casualties inflicted by the nuclear bomb, {{rather than on the}} motivations for the bombing or the discussion of the bomb's role in ending the conflict with Japan. <b>The</b> <b>exhibit</b> brought to national attention many long-standing academic and political issues related to retrospective views of the bombings. As a result, after various failed attempts to revise <b>the</b> <b>exhibit</b> {{in order to meet the}} satisfaction of competing interest groups, <b>the</b> <b>exhibit</b> was canceled on 30 January 1995. Martin O. Harwit, Director of the National Air and Space Museum, was compelled to resign over the controversy.|$|E

50|$|The game is educationally-based, and {{the player}} learns {{both from the}} many museum-like {{information}} cards placed throughout <b>the</b> <b>exhibits,</b> {{as well as from}} solving the problems in <b>the</b> <b>exhibits</b> themselves.

40|$|Interactive {{exhibits}} at science centres {{are believed}} to have a learning effect on visitors. This study investigates two interactive exhibits concerning mathematics at the Science centre in Trondheim, Norway, to what extent they appeal to the audience, and contributes to constructive thought processes that provide for learning. I was also looking for characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>exhibits</b> that might obstruct such thought processes. During the study we observed more than 170 visitors while they used <b>the</b> two <b>exhibits.</b> In addition I observed and interviewed seven teenagers hired specifically to work with <b>the</b> <b>exhibits.</b> Since <b>the</b> audience are completely free to use <b>the</b> <b>exhibits</b> as they like, it is assumed that there is a high correlation between time spent at <b>the</b> <b>exhibits</b> and public involvement. By measuring the average time for every age group, it was found that <b>the</b> <b>exhibits</b> engaged teenagers and adults to a high degree. Also children below 13 years of age used <b>the</b> <b>exhibits</b> diligently, but then in other ways than intended. Some major obstacles that the design of <b>the</b> <b>exhibits</b> let in <b>the</b> way of creating constructive thought processes among the audience were identified. For example, it was found that removing the time limitation of solving tasks and giving the audience the greatest possible transparency and control over <b>the</b> <b>exhibits,</b> a better basis for discussions and reflections was laid. This is an important premise for learning. Furthermore, changes in conditions were made in order to encourage the audience to try out new strategies...|$|R

5|$|The Science Behind Pixar is a {{travelling}} exhibition that first opened on June 28, 2015, at the Museum of Science in Boston, Massachusetts. It {{was developed by}} the Museum of Science in collaboration with Pixar. <b>The</b> <b>exhibit</b> features forty interactive elements that explain the production pipeline at Pixar. They are divided into eight sections, each demonstrating a step in the filmmaking process: Modeling, Rigging, Surfaces, Sets & Cameras, Animation, Simulation, Lighting, and Rendering.

5|$|In March 2008, {{construction}} on a full-size {{model of a}} H. missouriensis was completed and placed {{on display at the}} museum. Jetton, then Speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives, sponsored a dinner event for state legislators to celebrate the completion of <b>the</b> <b>exhibit</b> on March 7, 2008. The two-year project was directed by Darrough, who was also in charge of excavations at the Chronister excavation site, and is the only permanent museum exhibit to feature the species. At the opening of <b>the</b> <b>exhibit,</b> Jetton mentioned that he hoped the dig site would become part of a state park one day. Currently, excavation is being conducted by the Missouri Ozark Dinosaur Project. The site has been covered to prevent water from flowing over dig material. The Chronister dig site near Glen Allen, currently under private ownership by Stinchcomb, is the only location in Missouri where dinosaur bones have been found.|$|E

50|$|The {{museum in}} Wardown Park finally opened in 1930 with <b>the</b> <b>exhibits</b> being {{moved from the}} Carnegie library where it had started in 1927. Initially <b>the</b> <b>exhibits</b> were held in just two rooms, {{but over the years}} the museum has filled the whole building.|$|R

40|$|Appreciation of {{exhibits}} in {{a museum}} can be equated to a virtual experience of lives in the contexts originally surrounding <b>the</b> <b>exhibits.</b> Here {{we focus on the}} importance of weight information, and hence tested whether experiencing a weight during museum <b>exhibit</b> appreciation affects <b>the</b> beholders’ satisfaction and recognition memory for <b>the</b> <b>exhibits.</b> An experiment was performed at a museum exhibiting skeletal preparations of animals. We used nine preparations and prepared four weight stimuli as weight cues in accordance with the actual weight of four of the preparations: Remaining five preparations was displayed without weight stimuli. In the cued condition, participants were asked to lift up the weight stimuli during their observation of <b>the</b> four <b>exhibits.</b> In <b>the</b> uncued condition, participants observed <b>the</b> <b>exhibits</b> without touching <b>the</b> weight stimuli. After observation of <b>the</b> <b>exhibits,</b> <b>the</b> participants responded to a questionnaire that measured their impressions of <b>the</b> <b>exhibits</b> and <b>the</b> museum, and performed a recognition test on <b>the</b> <b>exhibits.</b> Results showed that memory performance was better and viewing duration was longer with weight lifting instruction than without instruction. A factor analysis on the questionnaires revealed four factors (likeability, contentment, value, and quality). A path analysis showed indirect effects of viewing duration on memory performance and willingness-to-pay for the museum appreciation through the impression factors. Our findings provide insight into a new interactive exhibition that enables long appreciation producing positive effects on visitors’ impression, memory, and value estimation for exhibits...|$|R

5|$|In 1965 a {{retrospective}} of Berni's work was organized at the Instituto Di Tella, including the collage Monsters.

The latter was exhibited in 1971 at the Paris Museum of Modern Art. By the late 1970s Berni's Juanito and Ramona oil paintings had evolved into three-dimensional altar pieces.|$|E
