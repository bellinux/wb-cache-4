5|$|<b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> {{conclusively}} seen on Westminster Hall {{as late as}} 1684, {{and it was on}} {{the south}} side of the Hall. Archaeological evidence also disproved its authenticity. The skull was pierced from the top, not from the bottom; and the skull had no trace of skin or hair, showing it had never been embalmed.|$|E
5|$|There were {{a number}} of {{development}} schemes for the head including a major railway and docks scheme proposed in 1885, proposals for housing and a golf course were also put forward before World War I, though none of these schemes came to fruition. In 1919 <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> sold by Sir George Meyrick to Harry Gordon Selfridge with plans to construct a grand house. These plans also came to nothing, apart from the establishment of a nursery garden. Bournemouth Borough Council purchased the head in 1930 for £25,200; although plans for housing existed west of double dykes, the head itself was to be kept as public open space. During World War II <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> closed to the public and was occupied by the army, becoming home to a number of installations including a radar station. The area was also extensively mined. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> finally cleared of the military defences by the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus, {{and most}} other theropods, {{probably}} primarily processed carcasses with lateral shakes of the head, like crocodilians. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> not as maneuverable as the skulls of allosauroids, due to flat joints of the neck vertebrae.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>head</b> pad {{can bring}} <b>the</b> <b>head</b> too far {{forward for the}} side panels to fully {{immobilize}} it. Care {{must be taken to}} secure <b>the</b> <b>head</b> properly to maintain neutral immobilization. If <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> too far forward, <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> brought back to meet the K.E.D. unless crepitus, pain or resistance is met. If these symptoms <b>are</b> present, <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> immobilized in <b>the</b> position found.|$|R
50|$|Smalahove is a {{traditional}} dish, usually eaten around and before Christmas time, made from a sheep's <b>head.</b> <b>The</b> skin and fleece of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> torched, <b>the</b> brain removed, and <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> salted, sometimes smoked, and dried. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> boiled for about 3 hours and served with mashed swede (rutabaga) and potatoes.|$|R

5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E
5|$|As no {{complete}} dodo specimens exist, its external appearance, such as plumage and colouration, {{is hard to}} determine. Illustrations {{and written}} accounts of encounters with the dodo between its discovery and its extinction (1598–1662) are the primary evidence for its external appearance. According to most representations, the dodo had greyish or brownish plumage, with lighter primary feathers and a tuft of curly light feathers high on its rear end. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> grey and naked, the beak green, black and yellow, and the legs were stout and yellowish, with black claws. A study {{of the few remaining}} feathers on the Oxford specimen head showed that they were pennaceous rather than plumaceous (downy) and most similar to those of other pigeons.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, the Croatian {{archeologist}} Ćiro Truhelka excavated {{bones in}} a settlement close to Jajce known as Kraljev Grob (meaning King's Tomb) {{and found the}} skeleton of a decapitated adult male. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> placed on the chest, with two coins in the mouth. Though by no means certain, {{it was assumed that}} the skeleton belonged to Stephen Tomašević. Despite objection from the friar Antun Knežević, who argued for leaving the bones where they had laid for centuries and constructing a small church at the site, the skeleton was placed in a glass coffin in the right aisle of the Franciscan monastery in Jajce.|$|E
5000|$|Generally: <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> {{relatively}} light, {{lean and}} wedge shaped. The ratio between the muzzle and the skull is 9 : 11. The total length of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> about 20 cm.|$|R
2500|$|In linguistics, <b>the</b> <b>head</b> {{directionality}} [...] <b>is</b> {{a proposed}} parameter that classifies languages {{according to whether}} they <b>are</b> head-initial (<b>the</b> <b>head</b> of a phrase precedes its [...] complements) or head-final (<b>the</b> <b>head</b> follows its complements). <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> element that determines the category of a phrase: for example, in a verb phrase, <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> a verb.|$|R
5000|$|The University of London has a {{chancellor}} (a ceremonial post) and a vice-chancellor (equivalent to {{a managing}} director). All colleges have a chief academic as head, {{using a variety}} of titles. At University College London, <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> [...] "provost"; at King's College London <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> [...] "principal"; at Imperial College London <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> [...] "rector"; and the London School of Economics <b>is</b> <b>headed</b> by a [...] "director".|$|R
5|$|In August 1958, workmen digging peat {{in an area}} of Chat Moss near Worsley {{discovered}} a severed head and called the police. It was initially believed that the head had been in the bog for less than a year, and so a search was conducted for more remains, but nothing was found. After X-rays and chemical tests, it was determined that the head had been in the bog for at least 100 years. An inquest was held into the man's death, at which the coroner returned an open verdict, and <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> put in the care of the Manchester Medical School.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the mention of several colours, authors such as Walter Rothschild claimed that the Gelderland journal {{described}} the bird as entirely blue-grey, and it was restored this way in Rothschild's 1907 book Extinct Birds. Later examination of the journal by Julian Hume has revealed only {{a description of the}} dodo. He suggested that the distinctively drawn facial mask may represent a separate colour. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> evidently blue, and in 2007, Hume suggested the beak may have been red, {{and the rest of the}} plumage greyish or blackish, which also occurs in other members of Psittaculini.|$|E
5|$|Inferences about {{behavior}} {{can also be}} drawn from examination of the inner ear. The semicircular canals within the inner ear aid in balance, and the lateral semicircular canal is usually {{parallel to the ground}} when the animal holds its head in an alert posture. When the skull of Majungasaurus is rotated so that its lateral canal is parallel to the ground, the entire skull is nearly horizontal. This contrasts with many other theropods, where <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> more strongly downturned when in the alert position. The lateral canal is also significantly longer in Majungasaurus than in its more basal relative Ceratosaurus, indicating a greater sensitivity to side-to-side motions of the head.|$|E
50|$|Caterpillars {{are mostly}} gray with yellow or green {{segmental}} rings and white {{spots on the}} abdominal segments. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> yellow-orange with two large, black spots, {{and the top of}} the thorax just behind <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> black.|$|R

5000|$|The {{individual}} {{begins in}} a supine {{position on a}} raised surface, with <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and neck extending off <b>the</b> edge. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> then moved {{up and down in}} a [...] "yes" [...] fashion. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> then turned from side to side in a [...] "no" [...] fashion. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> moved from side to side, bringing each ear to the nearest shoulder in a [...] "maybe" [...] fashion. The exercise may also be performed in a prone position, with the hands placed on the back of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> to provide extra resistance.|$|R
5|$|The Mari Lwyd custom was {{performed}} during wither festivities, specifically around {{the dates of}} Christmas and New Year. However, the precise date on which the custom {{was performed}} varied between villages, and {{in a number of}} cases the custom was carried out for several consecutive nights. There is a unique example provided by an account from Gower in which <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> kept buried throughout the year, only being dug up for use during the Christmas season.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain was}} {{slightly}} sigmoidal (S-shaped), without much {{expansion of the}} cerebral hemispheres, more like a crocodile than a bird. This {{is in keeping with}} the overall conservatism of non-coelurosaurian theropod brains. Acrocanthosaurus had large and bulbous olfactory bulbs, indicating a good sense of smell. Reconstructing the semicircular canals of the ear, which control balance, shows that <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> held at a 25° angle below horizontal. This was determined by orienting the endocast so that the lateral semicircular canal was parallel to the ground, as it usually is when an animal is in an alert posture.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name is unclear as it was not built until long after the reign of King John, who died in 1216. Its present name first {{appeared}} in a 1915 publication, The Heart of Mendip by Francis Knight, when it was being run as a saddler's shop. The royal part of the name {{may have come from}} {{the fact that there was}} a carved king's head on the building, from a time when The King's Head Inn occupied part of the premises, but whether this represented King John or another king is not known. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> attached to one corner of the exterior, but is now inside the building, and a replica placed on the outside.|$|E
50|$|A nod of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> {{a gesture}} in which <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> tilted in {{alternating}} {{up and down}} arcs along the sagittal plane. In many cultures, it is most commonly, but not universally, used to indicate agreement, acceptance, or acknowledgment.|$|R
50|$|Listing's law {{persists}} but {{takes on}} a torsional bias when <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> held at a tilted posture and the eyes counter-roll, and when <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> held steady upward or downward Listing's plane tilts slightly in the opposite direction.|$|R
5000|$|A. deraniyagalae {{is a small}} snake. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> indistinct from <b>the</b> neck, and {{the body}} is {{cylindrical}} in cross section.

5|$|Cox {{sold the}} head in 1799 for £230 (about £7,400 in today's money) to three {{brothers}} named Hughes. Interested in starting their own display in Bond Street, the brothers acquired the head as part of other Cromwell-related items. Thousands of posters were produced for the event, but the exhibit was marred by doubtful provenance. The Hughes brothers and their publicist, John Cranch, wrote Cox {{to ask about the}} gaps in the journey, but Cox was evasive, leading to concerns that he had sold them a fake. Indeed, Cranch could not come up with a documentary history of how the head came into their hands, so improvised a story that Cromwell's head was “the only instance of a head cut off and spiked that had before been embalmed; which is precisely the case with respect to {{the head in}} question”. Although Henry Ireton had also been embalmed before being beheaded, the story stuck, but it was in vain. The exhibition was a failure. The entrance fee was high (two shillings and sixpence, about the equivalent of £5) and rumours that <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> a fake were prevalent.|$|E
5|$|In Iron Age Britain around 700 BC, a {{settlement}} on <b>the</b> <b>Head</b> <b>was</b> established; also around this time, the headland {{was cut off}} from the mainland by the construction of two banks and ditches called the Double Dykes, similar to those found at Maiden Castle. The earthworks consisted of an inner bank three metres high, with a ditch three and a half metres deep. An outer ditch six metres wide and two metres in depth is now obscured due to wind-blown deposits of sand and a gradual silting process. These defences turned Hengistbury Head into a fortified settlement area which seems to have grown over succeeding centuries until it became an important port. The Iron Age port at Hengistbury Head forms a final site in a small chain of fortified earthworks, starting from Hambledon Hill, and also including Hod Hill, Spetisbury Rings, Buzbury Rings, Badbury Rings and Dudsbury Camp.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are easy}} to {{identify}} due to their perceptibly broad and smaller mandibles. Their antennae consist of 13 segments, and are almost the same length as the ants' bodies. Ergatandromorph (an ant that exhibits both male and worker characteristics) males are known; in 1985, a male M. gulosa was collected before it hatched from its cocoon, {{and it had a}} long but excessively curved left mandible while the other mandible was small. On the right side of its body, it was structurally male, but the left side appeared female. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> also longer on the female side, its colour was darker, and the legs and prothorax were smaller on the male side. Male genitalia are retracted into a genital cavity that is located in the posterior end of the gaster. The sperm is structurally the same to other animal sperm, forming an oval head with a long tail.|$|E
50|$|In Norway the smalahove is a {{traditional}} dish, usually eaten around and before Christmas time, made from a sheep's <b>head.</b> <b>The</b> skin and fleece of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> torched, <b>the</b> brain removed, and <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> salted, sometimes smoked, and dried. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> boiled for about 3 hours and served with mashed rutabaga/swede and potatoes.

Smalahove is considered by some to be unappealing or even repulsive. It is mostly enjoyed by enthusiasts, and is often served to tourists and more adventurous visitors.|$|R

5|$|The Dorset Ooser {{was first}} brought to public {{attention}} in 1891, {{at which time}} it was under the ownership of the Cave family of Melbury Osmond's Holt Farm. After travelling with Edward Cave to Somerset, the Ooser went missing around 1897. Since then, various folklorists and historians have debated {{the origins of the}} head, which has possible connections to the horned costumes sometimes worn by participants in English Mummers plays. The folklorists Frederick Thomas Elworthy and H. S. L. Dewar believed that <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> a representation of the Devil and thus was designed to intimidate people into behaving according to the local community's moral system. Conversely, the folklorist Margaret Murray suggested that it represented a pre-Christian god of fertility whose worship survived in Dorset into the modern period, although more recent scholarship has been highly sceptical of this interpretation. The etymology of Ooser is also disputed, with various possibilities available.|$|E
5|$|The {{advanced}} level of metallurgy in the area, coupled with its ease of access from the Continent, meant that Hengistbury Head became a significant Late-Iron Age port; trading worked metal of iron, silver, and bronze {{in return for}} figs, glass, tools and other goods. Armorican coins and pottery uncovered here show links to the Brittany peninsula. Amphorae used for the transportation of North Italian wine {{have been found in}} such quantities (more than all other sites in the south of England put together), that it is clear that <b>the</b> <b>Head</b> <b>was</b> a main port of entry into the country. However, no similar amphorae have been unearthed in Armorica, hinting at a more direct trade route between Hengistbury Head and Italy. Most of these vessels date from before 50 B.C., while later styles are absent despite being common in other parts of Britain, indicating the wine trade seems to have declined at about the time Caesar began his Gaulish campaigns.|$|E
5|$|The embryos {{probably}} represented near-hatchlings. While {{the skeletal}} features {{were similar to}} those of the adults, the body proportions were very dissimilar. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> big with a short snout and very large orbits, whose diameter amounts 39% of the entire skull length. The neck was short, contrasting to the very long neck in the adults. Girdle bones and caudals were relatively tiny. The forelimbs were of equal length to the hindlimbs, indicating that newly hatched Massospondylus were quadrupedal, unlike the bipedal adults. The discovery of hatching footprints with manus impressions confirmed their quadrupedality. These impressions show that the hand was not pronated, with palm faces facing each other and the thumb facing forwards. The unpronated manus and the big head indicate that an effective locomotion was not possible for newly hatched Massospondylus. Notably, the near-hatchings had no teeth, suggesting they had no way of feeding themselves. Based on the lack of teeth and the ineffective locomotion, scientists speculate that postnatal care might have been necessary. This is further supported by evidence that the hatchings remained at the nest sites until they had doubled in size.|$|E
50|$|H. damelii {{is a small}} snake. Adults may {{attain a}} total length of 38 cm, which {{includes}} a tail 6 cm long. It is olive dorsally, and yellowish white ventrally. In adults <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> darker than <b>the</b> body, and in juveniles <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> black.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Sydney <b>Heads</b> (also simply {{known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Heads)</b> <b>are</b> {{a series of}} {{headlands}} that form the 2 km entrance to Sydney Harbour in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.
