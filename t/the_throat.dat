5|$|A {{patch of}} {{coloured}} feathers found on <b>the</b> <b>throat</b> or upper breast of some species of birds. It is a feature found on many male hummingbirds, particularly {{those found in}} North America, whose gorgets are typically iridescent. Other species have gorgets, such as the purple-throated fruitcrow and the chukar partridge. The term {{is derived from the}} gorget used in military armor to protect <b>the</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|E
5|$|The call or croak of a frog {{is unique}} to its species. Frogs create this sound by passing air through the larynx in <b>the</b> <b>throat.</b> In most calling frogs, the sound is amplified {{by one or more}} vocal sacs, {{membranes}} of skin under <b>the</b> <b>throat</b> or {{on the corner of the}} mouth, that distend during the amplification of the call. Some frog calls are so loud that they can be heard up to a mile away.|$|E
5|$|Common ailments in {{domestic}} guinea pigs include respiratory tract infections, diarrhea, scurvy (vitamin C deficiency, typically characterized by sluggishness), abscesses due to infection (often in the neck, due to hay embedded in <b>the</b> <b>throat,</b> or from external scratches), and infections by lice, mites, or fungus.|$|E

5|$|Pelicans have mainly light-coloured plumage, the {{exceptions}} being the brown and Peruvian pelicans. The bills, pouches and bare facial skin of all species become brighter before breeding season commences. <b>The</b> <b>throat</b> pouch of the Californian subspecies {{of the brown}} pelican turns bright red, and fades to yellow after the eggs are laid, while <b>the</b> <b>throat</b> pouch of the Peruvian pelican turns blue. The American white pelican grows a prominent knob on its bill that is shed once females have laid eggs. The plumage of immature pelicans is darker than that of adults. Newly hatched chicks are naked and pink, darkening to grey or black after 4 to 14 days, then developing a covering of white or grey down.|$|E

5|$|The lungs of most {{frogs and}} other {{amphibians}} are simple and balloon-like, with gas exchange {{limited to the}} outer surface of the lung. This is not very efficient, but amphibians have low metabolic demands and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by diffusion across their skin in water, and supplement their oxygen supply by the same method. Amphibians employ a positive pressure system to get air to their lungs, forcing air down into the lungs by buccal pumping. This is distinct from most higher vertebrates, who use a breathing system driven by negative pressure where the lungs are inflated by expanding the rib cage. In buccal pumping, {{the floor of the}} mouth is lowered, filling the mouth cavity with air. <b>The</b> <b>throat</b> muscles then presses <b>the</b> <b>throat</b> against the underside of the skull, forcing the air into the lungs.|$|E
5|$|There are six stamens in one to {{two rows}} (whorls), with the {{filaments}} separate from the corona, attached at <b>the</b> <b>throat</b> or base of the tube (epipetalous), often of two separate lengths, straight or declinate-ascending (curving downwards, then upwards). The anthers are basifixed (attached at their base).|$|E
5|$|Ziphiids {{consist of}} 22 species of beaked whale. These vary from size, to coloration, to distribution, {{but they all}} share a similar hunting style.

40|$|Strongly warped regions, {{also known}} as throats, are a common feature of the type IIB string theory landscape. If one of <b>the</b> <b>throats</b> is heated during cosmological evolution, the energy is {{subsequently}} transferred to other throats or to massless fields in the unwarped bulk of the Calabi-Yau orientifold. This energy transfer proceeds either by Hawking radiation from the black hole horizon in <b>the</b> heated <b>throat</b> or, at later times, by the decay of throat-localized Kaluza-Klein states. In both cases, we calculate in a 10 d setup the energy transfer rate (respectively decay rate) {{as a function of}} the AdS scales of <b>the</b> <b>throats</b> and of their relative distance. Compared to existing results based on 5 d models, we find a significant suppression of the energy transfer rates if the size of the embedding Calabi-Yau orientifold is much larger than the AdS radii of <b>the</b> <b>throats.</b> This effect can be partially compensated by a small distance between <b>the</b> <b>throats.</b> These results are relevant, e. g., for the analysis of reheating after brane inflation. Our calculation employs the dual gauge theory picture in which each throat is described by a strongly coupled 4 d gauge theory, the degrees of freedom of which are localized at a certain position in th...|$|R

5|$|Adult frogs {{lay their}} eggs in moist places, {{including}} on leaves, in plants, among exposed roots, and elsewhere. Once the eggs hatch, the adult piggybacks the tadpoles, one at a time, to suitable water, either a pool, or the water gathered in <b>the</b> <b>throat</b> of bromeliads or other plants. The tadpoles remain there until they metamorphose, fed by unfertilized eggs laid at regular intervals by the mother.|$|E
5|$|Balaenopterids are the rorquals. These animals, {{along with}} the cetotheriids, rely on their throat pleats to gulp large amounts of water while feeding. <b>The</b> <b>throat</b> pleats extend from the mouth to the navel and allow the mouth to expand to a large volume for more {{efficient}} capture of the small animals they feed on. Balaenopterids consist of two genera and eight species.|$|E
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy; but are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join {{the attack and}} overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch escapes from his own damaged aircraft, wearing an AMP suit and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit <b>the</b> <b>throat</b> of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation.|$|E

5|$|In July 1952, Kesselring was {{diagnosed}} with a cancerous growth in <b>the</b> <b>throat.</b> During World War I, he had frequently smoked up to twenty cigars per day but he quit smoking in 1925. Although the British were suspicious of the diagnosis, they were concerned that he might die in prison like Mälzer, which would be a public relations disaster. Kesselring was transferred to a hospital, under guard. In October 1952, Kesselring was released from his prison sentence on the grounds of ill-health.|$|E

5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small aspirations of organisms residing in <b>the</b> <b>throat</b> or nose. Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep. While <b>the</b> <b>throat</b> always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only {{at certain times}} and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. Bacteria can spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.|$|E
