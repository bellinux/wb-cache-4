When Sonic Team {{developed}} Nights into Dreams..., they were new to programming for the Sega Saturn, and when the engine was re-used for Burning Rangers {{they were able to}} make it faster and more capable. To design the stages and environments, Miyoshi outlined the corridors first, then placed fires in them before adding light effects to simulate the appearance of fire. Miyoshi thought that the team had over-reached in designing the game's detailed stages, saying: [...] "everyone in the team wanted to put so much into the game that we only completed about half of what we wanted to do." [...] Naka said that although they designed only four stages, they ensured that the player's experience would increase progressively throughout the game because each stage was very large. The developers initially used motion capture technology <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> <b>data</b> for poses and animation, but Naka soon discovered {{that it was impossible to}} get the results the team wanted, as it was unfeasible for people to perform the special motions they needed. The developers resorted to creating the animation by hand, and only used the motion capture data for the player characters' walking animations.|$|E

While on their planet, he malfunctions and reveals {{the presence of}} the joint Federation–Son'a task force observing the Ba'ku. Starfleet Admiral Matthew Dougherty (Anthony Zerbe) contacts the USS Enterprise-E to obtain Data's schematics but adamantly states {{the presence of the}} Enterprise is not needed. Captain Picard decides to ignore these orders and takes the Enterprise <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> <b>Data.</b> [...] After stopping Data, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) becomes suspicious of Dougherty's insistence that the Enterprise is no longer needed. His crew investigates the cause of Data's malfunction. They discover that the Ba'ku have advanced technology, but have rejected its use to live simpler lives. Due to unique radiation or [...] "metaphasic particles" [...] emanating from their planet's rings, they are effectively immortal. Dougherty's allies, the Son'a, are a decrepit race who use medical techniques to prevent death; their excessive use of cosmetic surgery gives them a mummified appearance. The Enterprise crew also begin to experience the rejuvenation effects of the planet: Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) finds his eyes have regenerated and he no longer requires ocular implants; Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) rekindle their long-abandoned relationship; and Picard develops a romantic relationship with the Ba'ku woman Anij (Donna Murphy).|$|E

2500|$|Commentators {{and policymakers}} have {{expressed}} concern about the poor educational performance of Somali pupils in British schools. No nationwide statistics are available on the number and educational attainment of Somali pupils in the UK. This is because [...] "Somali" [...] is not a tick-box option in official ethnicity classifications. Consequently, Somali students are often aggregated into a broader [...] "Black African" [...] category in pupil performance data. Some local education authorities in England make use of so-called [...] "extended ethnicity codes" [...] in order <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> <b>data</b> on more specific groups of pupils, including Somalis. Collating data from local authorities that collect this data, the Institute for Public Policy Research has published statistics on GCSE performance by extended ethnicity code. According to these statistics, in the school year 2010–11, the proportion of Somali pupils being awarded five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C, including in mathematics and English, was 23.7 percentage points below the average for all groups of 56.9 per cent. Feyisa Demie of the London Borough of Lambeth's Research and Statistics Unit has used language spoken at home as a proxy for ethnicity, using language data on pupils whose first language is not English, which has been collected in England since 2007. His analysis shows that of the 2,748 pupils classified as Black African and speaking Somali at home taking GCSEs in 2012, 47 per cent gained five or more A*-C grades, compared to 58 per cent of all Black African students and a national average for all pupils of 59 per cent.|$|E
