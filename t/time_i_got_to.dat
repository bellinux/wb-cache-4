[...] In 1984, he earned his bachelor's degree in natural-resource {{planning}} and interpretation, with an emphasis in marine resources. He intended to take a master's degree, but {{said it would be}} in art: [...] "Initially I think I assumed that if I went to school for art I would never have any way of making a living, so I thought it might be smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else. But by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the end of my undergrad work, I realized I should be in art." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{end of the}} storyline was criticised by gay advocates after Charlie {{was seen}} having sex with Hugo Austin (Bernard Curry) and Joey left Summer Bay alone. Anderson also {{suggested}} that Hugo may {{have been enough to}} [...] "sway" [...] Charlie towards men. Some sceptics had suggested that Home and Away would not allow Charlie and Joey to remain in a same-sex relationship. Anderson later acknowledged she had feared that the story would see her typecast as [...] "the lesbian cop." [...] Anderson reflected on the storyline during an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying [...] "The Charlie/Joey (lesbian) storyline was the first time you got to see Charlie's vulnerable side. (The controversy) blew my mind – I wasn't expecting it at all. I think it was a fantastic storyline because for the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> show the producers and audience what I could do." ...|$|E
500|$|Just prior of {{the casting}} call and video shoot, Stansberry {{expressed}} his views to MTV News {{on the concept}} for the video – originality. [...] "Originality, being you. This song is about being who you want. It's about letting loose. There's no explanation. This is this underground video, this underground party." [...] During the video shoot, MTV interviewed Lopez about the concepts for the video. Lopez described some of the characters she played, telling MTV that in one scene [...] "I play one character where she kind of runs this party, acts like she's kind of over it, {{but at the same}} time loves it and loves this kind of underground kind of party dance culture,... So I got to be wild and crazy, and at the same <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be sexy and sweet too." [...] The video makes use of product placement, including BMW, Swarovski and Crown Royal, according to Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly. Stransky also noted the [...] "unintentional placement" [...] of fake eyelashes and wigs, weaves, and other hair-extending products.|$|E

2500|$|Paris {{was a city}} which McTell {{revisited}} frequently. Late in 1965 he and {{a friend}} from Croydon took a room in a cheap hotel on the Left Bank, earning their rent by busking cinema queues. After braving a bitterly cold Paris winter, McTell met a young American, Gary Petersen, who had studied with the legendary guitarist Reverend Gary Davis. [...] "There was a great anticipation every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> play with (Petersen)," [...] McTell recalled. [...] "Each time I learned something new, and through him I learned how to play ragtime properly." ...|$|E

'It does arise {{directly}} from the consideration of the struggle {{to get away from}} speaking Cornish dialect and to speak correct English, a struggle which I began thus early and pursued constantly with no regret, for was it not the key which unlocked the door to all that lay beyond—Oxford, the world of letters, the community of all who speak the King’s English, from which I should otherwise have been infallibly barred? But the struggle made me very sensitive about language; I hated to be corrected; nothing is more humiliating: and it left me with a complex about Cornish dialect. The inhibition which I had imposed on myself left me, by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Oxford, incapable of speaking it; and for years, with the censor operating subconsciously...' ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Extra at the Vevo Certified SuperFanFest on 8 October 2014, Azalea commented that she was [...] "really excited" [...] about her upcoming release saying that the new material was [...] "uptempo and fun," [...] adding that she [...] "did a lot more collaborations because I felt like I had doors open for me and I {{had the opportunity to}} collaborate with artists that I didn't have before when I made my first album, so this <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> kind of call whoever I wanted up and do my dream collaborations – it's really exciting!" [...] During yet another interview with Radio.com backstage at the CBS Radio We Can Survive concert at the Hollywood Bowl on 24 October 2014, Azalea mentioned her longtime desire to work with Ellie Goulding and after meeting several times she was approached by Goulding about a song that would become [...] "Heavy Crown", recalling [...] "she played it for me and I was in love with it and just felt it was so kind of appropriate for this to be our collaboration," [...] because it [...] "brings out something different in both artists that you don't usually see." [...] Most notably, the track shows off an edgier side of Goulding, whose voice Azalea called [...] "unique and ethereal sounding." [...] "She loved it because she felt like she doesn't do things that are as aggressive as our song together," [...] Azalea explained.|$|E

"I got a ride part o' the {{way from}} Commercial Road to Aldgate by getting on the wrong bus, but it wasn't much good, and I was quite tired by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back <b>to</b> the wharf.

60|$|By this <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{the door}} and stood up. All was dark within, so that I could {{distinguish}} nothing by the eye.

60|$|I made Caddy Jellyby--her {{maiden name}} was so natural {{to me that}} I always called her by it--the pretext for this visit and wrote her a note {{previously}} asking the favour of her company on a little business expedition.

60|$|By the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{my third}} {{appointment}} I was entirely exhausted.

6000|$|... "But, Aunt Dahlia, {{listen to}} reason. I assure you, you've {{got hold of}} the wrong man. I'm hopeless at a game like that. Ask Jeeves about the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> lugged in <b>to</b> address a girls' school. I made the most colossal ass of myself." ...|$|R

60|$|It was a {{load off}} of my mind.

40|$|UCI # 8. Watching {{the team}} <b>time</b> trials, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> observe cyclists as they <b>got</b> closer <b>to</b> the finish line. In this photo, the cyclist {{on the far}} right has his head bent down. Maybe this is an {{aerodynamic}} strategy, but based on his body language, I also saw that he was exhausted, that he pushing himself to get to complete the race. I’ve really come to admire everyone’s perseverance and dedication to see things through in this sport. [URL]...|$|R
6000|$|After looking round, I found a {{stick and}} went to {{scraping}} out the pen, which was awkward work enough, for another boat called the [...] "jolly-boat," [...] was capsized right over the longboat, which brought them almost close together.

6000|$|... 3. No boats on Sunday, never: so I {{was forced}} to walk, and so hot by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Ford's lodging that I was quite spent; I think the weather is mad. I could not go to church. I dined with the Secretary as usual, and old Colonel Graham(12) that lived at Bagshot Heath, and {{they said it was}} Colonel Graham's house. Pshaw, I {{remember}} it very well, when I used {{to go for a walk}} to London from Moor Park. What, I warrant you do not remember the Golden Farmer(13) neither, figgarkick soley?(14) ...|$|E

60|$|By the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back <b>to</b> the ship, {{every thing}} {{was in an}} uproar. The pea-jacket man was there, {{ordering}} about a good many men in the rigging, and people were bringing off chickens, and pigs, and beef, and vegetables from the shore. Soon after, another man, in a striped calico shirt, a short blue jacket and beaver hat, made his appearance, and went to ordering about {{the man in the}} big pea-jacket; and at last the captain came up the side, and began to order about both of them.|$|R
60|$|Miss Carruthers, of the refined comedy team--did {{you ever}} see her cross both feet back of her neck?--gave me {{to a friend of}} hers who had made an unfortunate {{marriage}} with a man in a store.

60|$|I got {{nobody to}} come back with me but the {{supercargo}} and two men, and with these I walked back to the boats. It was a very great piece of folly in me, I confess, to venture back as it were alone; for as it began now to be almost day, and the alarm had run over the country, there stood about forty men armed with lances and bows at the little place where the twelve or thirteen houses stood mentioned before, but by accident I missed the place, and came directly to the sea-side; and by that <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the sea-side it was broad day: immediately I took the pinnace and went aboard, and sent her back to assist the men in what might happen.|$|E
60|$|Dobble's {{reputation}} for courage was not increased by the butcher's-dog adventure; but mine stood very high: little Stubbs was voted the boldest chap {{of all the}} bold North Bungays. And though I must confess, what was proved by subsequent circumstances, that nature has NOT endowed me with a large, or even, I may say, an average share of bravery, yet a man is very willing to flatter himself to the contrary; and, after a little <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> believe that my killing the dog was an action of undaunted courage, and that I was as gallant {{as any of the}} one hundred thousand heroes of our army. I always had a military taste--it's only the brutal part of the profession, the horrid fighting and blood, that I don't like.|$|E

"I'm rather glad I {{found you}} out here alone," [...] began the latter; [...] "it saves <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>to</b> take my turn with the rest, in there"--he {{indicated}} the church with his thumb--"and you haven't <b>got</b> <b>to</b> make an appointment.

5000|$|In Behind the Urals Scott recalls many {{examples}} of the danger workers faced in Magnitogorsk: [...] I {{was just going to}} start welding when I heard someone sing out, and something swished down past me.
