5|$|In his Commentary on Isaiah (1529), Zwingli {{noted that}} there were three kinds of governments: monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. He {{expressed}} his preference for aristocracy which is not surprising given his experience with the Zürich council. In the publication, rather than comparing the three forms of government, he gave a defence of aristocracy against a monarchy. He argued that a monarchy would invariably descend to tyranny. A monarchy had inherent weaknesses in <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> ruler could be easily replaced by a bad one or a single ruler could be easily corrupted. An aristocracy with more people involved did not have these disadvantages.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's works, {{especially}} his Lives of the Poets series, describe various features of excellent writing. He {{believed that the}} best poetry relied on contemporary language, and he disliked the use of decorative or purposefully archaic language. He was suspicious of the poetic language used by Milton, whose blank verse he believed would inspire many bad imitations. Also, Johnson opposed the poetic language of his contemporary Thomas Gray. His greatest complaint was that obscure allusions found in works like Milton's Lycidas were overused; he preferred poetry that could be easily read and understood. In addition to his views on language, Johnson believed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> poem incorporated new and unique imagery.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} piece of advice Yamamoto gave Kurosawa was <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> director needed to master screenwriting. Kurosawa soon realized that the potential earnings from his scripts were much higher than what he was paid as an assistant director. Kurosawa would later write or co-write all of his own films. He also frequently wrote screenplays for other directors such as for the antiwar film director Satsuo Yamamoto's film, A Triumph of Wings (Tsubasa no gaika, 1942). This outside scriptwriting would serve Kurosawa as a lucrative sideline lasting well into the 1960s, long after he became world-famous.|$|E

5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.|$|E

Phthalazine derivatives have applications as therapeutic agents, chemiluminescent materials, ligands in transition metal catalysis, and as optical materials. Some time ago, our research group developed a methodology for the preparation of phthalazine derivatives in three steps, affording halo-thienyl-phthalazine derivatives <b>that</b> play <b>an</b> important role in diazine chemistry since they offer great potential for further functionalization by nucleophilic displacement of the halogen, making numerous otherwise inaccessible diazines become available. In continuation of the work developed before by our research group, we report in this communication the synthesis and {{the evaluation of the}} optical properties of two novel thienyl-phthalazine derivatives, having in mind further functionalization to prepare push-pull heterocyclic systems for several optical and photovoltaic applications. These studies showed that the optical properties could be readily tuned by varying the π-conjugation path length through the introduction of a second thiophene unit.

5|$|Because Irenaeus saw {{the purpose}} of the world to be the {{development}} of the moral character of humans, he believed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> world would be best suited to that purpose. Irenaeaus believed that this world would include some suffering and evil to help people draw closer to God. He perceived God's declaration in the Book of Genesis that his creation was good to mean that the world is fit for purpose, rather than being free from suffering. To illustrate the benefits of suffering, Irenaeus cited the Biblical example of Jonah, from the Book of Jonah. His suffering, being swallowed by a whale, both enabled God's plan to be fulfilled and also brought Jonah closer to God: Jonah ended up repenting for his sin and the people of Nineveh turn to God.|$|E
5|$|Mansell, {{with three}} ships (the 30 gun Hope {{along with the}} 42 gun Victory and the Answer) {{departed}} and patrolled about Dungeness. Mansell's flag captain {{came up with the}} strategy on how to tackle Spinola; he predicted that Spinola would try to sail close to the English coast. Acting on this hunch Mansell set one ship a good distance from another using flyboats so <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> communication system was erected between themselves and the Dutch fleet off the Flemish coast under acting Vice-Admiral Jan Cant. On the 3rd Mansell was soon joined by two Dutch flyboats, Samson, and the Moon to improve communication and now Spinola was effectively sailing into a trap.|$|E
5|$|Montalbán said in promotional {{interviews}} {{for the film}} he realized early on in his career <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> villain does not see himself as villainous.

Montalbán further stated he always {{tried to find a}} flaw in the character, as no one is completely good or completely evil; while Khan had a rather distorted view of reality and therefore performed acts of evil, he still felt that his vengeance was a noble cause because of the death of his wife. Khan quotes the character of Ahab from Moby-Dick throughout the film, driving home his lust to make Kirk pay for the wrongs he has inflicted upon him.|$|E

5|$|Various {{forms of}} divine command theory have been {{presented}} by philosophers including William of Ockham, St Augustine, Duns Scotus, and John Calvin. The theory generally teaches that moral truth does not exist independently of God and that morality is determined by divine commands. Stronger versions of the theory assert that God's command is the only reason <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> action is moral, while weaker variations cast divine command as a vital component within a greater reason. The theory asserts that good actions are morally good {{as a result of}} their being commanded by God, and many religious believers subscribe to some form of divine command theory. Because of these premises, adherents believe that moral obligation is obedience to God's commands; what is morally right is what God desires.|$|E

25|$|The {{dynamics}} of the basic game may have one serious flaw: it seems <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> but conservative player can set up his or her marbles in a defensive wedge and ward off all attacks indefinitely.

Thus, from the starting position, it takes little skill and no imagination to avoid losing, and nothing in the rules prevents games from being interminable.|$|E

Queen Margaret of England's green and red chess sets – made of jasper and crystal – symbolized chess's position in royal art treasures. Kings Henry I, Henry II and Richard I of England were chess patrons. Other monarchs who gained similar status were Alfonso X of Castile and Ivan IV of Russia.|$|E
