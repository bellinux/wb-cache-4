40|$|The {{concept of}} {{conductor}} <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> has gained in importance with development of advanced electricity networks whose main {{objective is to}} increase the capacity, efficiency and reliability of modern power systems. The methods applied to the conductor <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> of overhead lines can be roughly classified as direct and indirect. In direct methods for conductor <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring,</b> the <b>temperature</b> is measured directly or by measuring a particular conductor parameter, which is temperature dependent such as sag, tension, conductor resistance, conductor distance from the ground, etc. In indirect methods for the conductor <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring,</b> the conductor <b>temperature</b> is obtained by applying a specific mathematical model that as an input uses the measured values of weather parameters and line current. Basically, this paper focuses on the issues of direct methods for conductor <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring,</b> thus providing an analysis of advantages and disadvantages of each method...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{system for}} {{mechanical}} press’s bearing is presented. As multipoints of the cranks {{need to be}} monitored, the system is based on RS 485 BUS, which is a distributed, real-time and reliable <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> net. It consists of the <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> sub module and the master module. The sub module gets temperature data via thermocouple and MAX 6675. The master module controls the whole system with an ARM IC. The system can judge whether the temperature of bearing has exceed the limited value or the temperature is rising too fast, and send alarm signal to stop the press in those cases. Configuring this <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> system to the large or medium scale mechanical press can avoid the accident like bearing-burnt effectively...|$|R

40|$|Electrical {{methods of}} <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> offer the {{possibility}} to carry out measurements at single points. Known methods for the two-dimensional <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> need optical evaluation methods as well as sufficient space and are therefore costly or infeasible to integrate when space is not available. In order to simplify the two-dimensional <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> a thermal sensitive coating, which enables read-out by electrical signals, can be applied. Advanced composite materials consisting of nanoparticles and polymer binder show an electrical resistance which varies with temperature. These materials can be processed using standard methods and offer {{the possibility of a}} two-dimensional coating with thickness in the micrometer range without treating the substrate with high temperature. With such materials a flat <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> can be realised with the advantage of reduced weight and volume...|$|R

50|$|When a lamp is {{operated}} past its rated lifespan, the efficiency declines significantly, the lightcast may become uneven, and the lamp starts to operate extremely hot, {{to the point}} that the power wires can melt off the lamp terminals. Eventually, the required startup voltage will also rise to the point where ignition can no longer occur. Secondary protections such as a <b>temperature</b> <b>monitor</b> may shut down the projector, but a thermally overstressed quartz arc tube can also crack and/or explode. However, practically all lamp housings contain heat-resistant barriers (in addition to those on the lamp unit itself) to prevent the red-hot quartz fragments from leaving the area.|$|E
