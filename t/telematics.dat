5|$|In 1989, Lexus became {{among the}} first premium car marques to equip models with premium audio systems, in {{partnership}} with stereo firm Nakamichi. Since 2001, optional surround sound systems are offered via high-end audio purveyor Mark Levinson. For reduced cabin noise, the first LS 400 introduced sandwich steel plating, and later models added acoustic glass. In 2006, the LS 460 debuted the first ceiling air diffusers and infrared body temperature sensors in a car. <b>Telematics</b> services include G-Book with G-Link in Asia and Lexus Enform in North America.|$|E

In {{its highest}} trim specification, the LS 430 {{included}} Lexus Link <b>telematics,</b> power door and trunk closers, heated and cooled front seats, and power reclining massage rear seats equipped with audio controls, power sunshade, a cooler, and air purifier. Several rear seat features adopted for the LS 430 {{had been previously}} available in Japanese market luxury vehicles. Safety features added to the LS 430 included front and rear side curtain airbags, park sensors, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and electronic brakeforce distribution.

25|$|According to BMW, at the {{beginning}} of the i3 release, the use of range-extender was much more than the carmaker expected, more than 60%. Over time it has decreased significantly, with some people almost never using it, and by 2016 it is being regularly used in fewer than 5% of i3s. In early October 2014, General Motors reported, based on data collected through its OnStar <b>telematics</b> system, that Volt owners in North America have accumulated a total of 1 billion miles (1.6 billion km) traveled, of which, about 62.5% were driven in all-electric mode. A similar report, issued by GM in August 2016, reported that Volt owners have accumulated almost 1.5 billion miles (2.4 billion km) driven in EV mode, representing 60% of their total miles traveled.|$|E
25|$|OBD II is {{no longer}} only used by {{professionals}} and hobbyists to repair vehicles. OBD II information is commonly used by vehicle <b>telematics</b> devices that perform fleet tracking, monitor fuel efficiency, prevent unsafe driving, {{as well as for}} remote diagnostics and by pay-as-you-drive insurance. Although originally not intended for the above purposes, commonly supported OBD II data such as vehicle speed, RPM, and fuel level allow GPS-based fleet tracking devices to monitor vehicle idling times, speeding, and over-revving. By monitoring OBD II DTCs a company can know immediately if one of its vehicles has an engine problem and by interpreting the code the nature of the problem. OBD II is also monitored to block mobile phones when driving and to record trip data for insurance purposes.|$|E
