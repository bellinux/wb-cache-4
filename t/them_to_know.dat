The names of many companies, including Standard Oil, had also been discussed {{as well as those}} of other large companies.

This led him to propose that the priests must have had some form of computed calendar or calendrical rules that allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> in advance whether a month would have 30 or 29 days, and whether a year would have 12 or 13 months.|$|E

In the laboratory, Frank (Fredric Lehne) prays over Grace's (Lizzie Brocheré) body and tells Dr. Arden (James Cromwell) they should report the recent kitchen events to the police.

I wanted {{people to know that}} thousands upon thousands of their fellow citizens were being assaulted daily, and that the police—in this case, the federal government—had done nothing to remedy the situation. In short I wanted <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that murder was being committed in the workplace, and that no one was bothering about it.|$|E

25|$|Home Life of Great Authors, {{published}} in Chicago, in 1877, included descriptive sketches of many authors, with glimpses {{of their home}} life and personal and domestic character: Goethe, Wordsworth, Lamb, Shelley, Emerson, George Sand, Tennyson, Whittier, Robert and Elizabeth B. Browning, Poe, Eliot, Burns, De Quincey, North, Irving, Carlyle, Macaulay, Hawthorne, Holmes, Charlotte Bronte, Thackeray, Kingsley, Madame de Stael, Scott, Lord Byron, Bryant, Hugo, Lytton, Longfellow, Lowell, Margaret Fuller, Dickens, and Ruskin. As its title would indicate, the book aimed to give a more personal and intimate view {{of men and women}} well-known to fame than was to be found in most reference works. The young readers of this volume learned that dates and statistics do not enable <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> people; they need to have some personal details as to the habits and daily lives of the people about whom they read. Griswold said in one of her works that as she had had such a hard time {{when she was a girl}} getting any picture in her mind of the great people about whom she read, that she determined to make it easier for other boys and girls to obtain these mental pictures; that is why she wrote The Home Life of Great Authors.|$|E
500|$|This {{silence was}} an {{exception}} to the practice of oral history among black families. Minnie Lee Langley knew James and Emma Carrier as her parents.

I just didn't want <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what kind of way I come up. I didn't want <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> white folks want us out of our homes." [...] Decades passed before she began to trust white people. Some families spoke of Rosewood, but forbade the stories from being told: Arnett Doctor heard the story from his mother, Philomena Goins Doctor, who was with Sarah Carrier the day Fannie Taylor claimed she was assaulted, and was in the house with Sylvester Carrier. She told her children about Rosewood every Christmas. Doctor was consumed by his mother's story; he would bring it up to his aunts only to be dissuaded from speaking of it.|$|E

Shawn talks to detective Lassiter and tells him of his plan to put the criminals back in prison due to parole violations; Lassiter denies Shawn's idea, wanting to find the money {{and put an end}} to the case. Determined, Shawn and Gus visit the robber's hotel room, in order to find {{evidence}} to put them back in prison. However, they are caught in the process. In an attempt to save themselves, Shawn tells the men that David wants <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> where the money is and that they shouldn't harm Raylene; the robbers inform them that Raylene was actually the mastermind of the plan. Shawn and Gus rush back to the cemetery to find Raylene threatening to shoot David if she doesn't get the money. Shawn stalls long enough for the robbers, Juliet, and Lassiter to show up, and David and Raylene are arrested. Shawn then [...] "psychically" [...] locates the money.|$|E

500|$|A {{major theme}} of the {{dictator}} novel concerns the use of writing as a medium of power. In , Asturias uses language to challenge dictatorial power. Throughout the novel the reader observes {{the authority of the}} President over the people through his control of what they write. In the chapter [...] "The President's Mail-Bag", a stream of letters informs the President of peoples' actions. While many are [...] "writing the truth" [...] and turning in their fellow citizens, many others feel that [...] "it is not safe to trust to paper". Writing is closely linked to authority and is a means to solidify power, because language can be manipulated into lies that eventually kill. For example, the President orders a newspaper to include the false statement that he attended the wedding of Camila, the daughter of General Canales. When the General reads these words and perceives them as truth, his heart is broken and he subsequently dies. Miguel Angel Face is also killed by the manipulation of words: he is told that Camila has become the President's mistress, and upon hearing this falsified news, he loses the will to live. These episodes in the novel demonstrate how closely language, the written word, and power are linked. The characters in [...] lose their sense of reality, making it difficult for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who to trust. As Rosello argues, [...] "in this state of terror, language is deliberately used as a means of seducing the addressee into harmlessness, and has lost its function of conveying information".|$|E

My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E
