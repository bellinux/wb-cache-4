5|$|Although Johnson was {{recruited}} by several top-ranked colleges such as Indiana and UCLA, {{he decided to}} play close to home. His college decision came down to Michigan and Michigan State in East Lansing. He ultimately decided to attend Michigan State when coach Jud Heathcote {{told him he could}} play the point guard position. The talent already on Michigan State's roster also drew him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E
5|$|CTW {{conducted}} research in two ways: in-house formative research that informed and improved production, and independent summative evaluations {{conducted by the}} Educational Testing Service (ETS) during the show's first two seasons to measure the program's educational effectiveness. CTW researchers invented tools to measure young viewers' attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>program.</b> Based on these findings, the researchers compiled a body of data and the producers changed the show accordingly. The formative research on Sesame Street {{was the first time}} children's television viewing was studied scientifically.|$|E
5|$|Classes in {{the program}} began in 1955. The program's long-time director, Howard Sheath, {{beginning}} in March 1956, instituted several innovations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> which proved popular with external students. These included sending lecturers to rural communities to give weekend seminars and establishing University Centres throughout New South Wales for students to assemble for lectures and discussion groups, and take examinations.|$|E

5|$|Kurt is a SPARTAN-II {{who serves}} in John-117's squad. Kurt {{is known for}} his sense of intuition, which saves his team on several occasions. Recruited to train a new series of Spartans, Kurt is devastated by the massive {{casualties}} his trainees suffer. In response, Kurt begins instituting illegal brain modifications to give his soldiers a better chance at survival. Due to the secretive lengths taken by his superiors to recruit him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> none of Kurt's former colleagues know he is alive.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the largely}} {{forgotten}} show {{was located in}} the 1980s by film historian Jim Schoenberger, with the ending (including credits) found afterward. Both copies are black and white kinescopes, but the original live broadcast was in color.

Both men and women competed at these Games, with 886 female and 1513 male athletes competing.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 36 sports, 51 {{disciplines}} and 364 medal events were contested in these Games. Basque pelota {{was the only}} sport dropped from the last games. Golf (after being added to the Olympic program for 2016) also made its Pan American Games debut. Canoe slalom, the only Olympic discipline never to have been held at the Games, also made its debut, meaning {{for the first time}} the entire Olympic sports program was contested. Furthermore, both canoe disciplines had C-1 events for women for the first time. Women's baseball and women's rugby sevens also made their debuts, with men's softball returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> after last being contested in 2003.

5|$|According to a Sakura Blog study, Yuri on Ice {{used more}} key animators {{than any other}} anime series during the fall 2016 season: an average of 48.5 key animators per episode, five more than Flip Flappers (which had the second-highest number of key animators). In the early episodes of the series, each {{character}} was handled by a different key animator, meaning that skating style of the characters differed from each other. In the skating scenes, the sound effects were changed to match each venue, according to the building's capacity and crowd size. The skating sounds for each sequence were recorded separately. No stock sounds {{were used for the}} sequences because each part sounds different, and no footage of professional skaters was used because the music in the programmes normally muffles the sounds. Thus the sounds used were recorded and performed by series choreographer Miyamoto, and each skating sequence is unique <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the time, Baden-Powell {{intended}} {{that the}} scheme {{would be used}} by established organizations, in particular the Boys' Brigade, from the founder William A. Smith. However, because of the popularity of his person and the adventurous outdoor games he wrote about, boys spontaneously formed Scout patrols and flooded Baden-Powell with requests for assistance. He encouraged them, and the Scouting movement developed momentum. In 1910 Baden-Powell formed The Boy Scouts Association in the United Kingdom. As the movement grew, Sea Scouts, Air Scouts, and other specialized units were added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E

Despite Monson's inability to field a consistent winner, he was lauded by University officials for bringing integrity and cleanliness back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>program.</b> Assistant coach Jim Molinari was named head coach on an interim basis and, after a 3–13 Big Ten record to finish the season, was not retained as head coach.
