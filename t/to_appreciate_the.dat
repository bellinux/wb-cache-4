5|$|Sicilian Baroque {{is today}} {{recognised}} as an architectural style, {{largely due to}} the work of Sacheverall Sitwell, whose Southern Baroque Art of 1924 was the first book <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> style, followed by the more academic work of Anthony Blunt.|$|E
5|$|Agrippa was {{extremely}} influential—as a sigil for the artistic community <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> potential of electronic media—for {{the extent to}} which it entered public consciousness. It caused a fierce controversy in the art world, among museums and among libraries. It challenged established notions of permanence of art and literature, and, as Ashbaugh intended, raised significant problems for archivists seeking to preserve it for the benefit of future generations. Agrippa was also used as the key of a book cipher in the Cicada 3301 mystery.|$|E

Nixon attended Cabinet and National Security Council meetings and chaired them when Eisenhower was absent. A 1953 tour of the Far East succeeded in increasing local goodwill toward the United States and prompted Nixon <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> potential of the region as an industrial center. He visited Saigon and Hanoi in French Indochina. On {{his return to the}} United States at the end of 1953, Nixon increased the amount of time he devoted to foreign relations.|$|E

5|$|In the 70s, AI {{was subject}} to critiques and {{financial}} setbacks. AI researchers had failed <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> difficulty of the problems they faced. Their tremendous optimism had raised expectations impossibly high, and when the promised results failed to materialize, funding for AI disappeared. At the same time, the field of connectionism (or neural nets) was shut down almost completely for 10 years by Marvin Minsky's devastating criticism of perceptrons.|$|E
5|$|Peter Molydeux is a Twitter account {{presented}} as a parody of the game designer Peter Molyneux. Created by game artist Adam Capone in 2009, it posts audacious game design ideas {{in the style of}} Molyneux. The account presents Molyneux as a tragicomic character with unrelenting, creative ideas that are continually received by an apathetic audience. Over time, the account evolved from a Molyneux-based persona into a list of potential game concepts. A common theme of the tweets is the untapped potential of emotional game experiences. Molyneux came <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> parody, and has since met Capone in person.|$|E

There she quickly came <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> wealth and strength of the Principality of Achaea, and arranged the marriage of her daughter Agnes to the principality's heir, Geoffrey II of Villehardouin (r. c. 1229–46). A politically astute ruler, Yolanda also secured her eastern border by offering her daughter Maria of Courtenay in marriage to Theodore Laskaris, who had just been widowed for the second time.|$|E

The episode included the first appearances of guest actors Andre Royo and Amy Madigan, who would both appear in several later episodes. It first aired in the United States on Fox in September 23, 2010, receiving almost all positive reviews due to the combination of emotional storylines, suspense, action, and humor.

5|$|While in Egypt, Fairley {{investigated}} schistosomiasis (then {{known as}} bilharzia). The disease {{was known to}} be caused by contact with fresh water inhabited by certain species of snails, and orders had been issued that prohibited bathing in fresh water, but the troops were slow <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> danger involved. In its toxic phase, the disease was easily confused with typhus, so Fairley developed a complement fixation test for the disease {{along the lines of the}} Wassermann test. He studied its pathology, confirming that the worms in the circulatory system could be cured by intravenous tartaric acid. Fairley also studied, and later published papers on typhus, malaria, and bacillary dysentery.|$|E
5|$|In {{pictures}} {{taken by the}} Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, the motion of M87's jet was measured at four to six times the speed of light. This motion is presumably an optical illusion caused by the relativistic velocity of the jet, and not true superluminal motion. However, detection of such motion supports the theory that quasars, BL Lacertae objects and radio galaxies may all be the same phenomenon, known as active galaxies, viewed from different perspectives. It has been proposed M87 could actually be a BL Lacertae object (with a low-luminosity nucleus compared with the brightness of its host galaxy) seen from an unfavorable angle <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> properties {{of that kind of}} galaxy.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} war strategy, Lincoln {{articulated}} two priorities: {{to ensure that}} Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days. Twice a week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force {{him to take a}} carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard. Lincoln learned from reading the theoretical book of his chief of staff General Henry Halleck, a disciple of the European strategist Jomini; he began <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River. Lincoln saw the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{opportunity}} for Durkheim to a receive major academic appointment in Paris was inhibited by {{his approach to}} society. From 1882 to 1887 he taught philosophy at several provincial schools. In 1885 he decided to leave for Germany, where for two years he studied sociology at the universities of Marburg, Berlin and Leipzig. As Durkheim indicated in several essays, it was in Leipzig that he learned <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> value of empiricism and its language of concrete, complex things, {{in sharp contrast to}} the more abstract, clear and simple ideas of the Cartesian method. By 1886, as part of his doctoral dissertation, he had completed the draft of his The Division of Labour in Society, and was working towards establishing the new science of sociology.|$|E
5|$|Using the French ports, U-boats {{targeted}} many {{of their}} victims just east of 20°W. The services set up the ACHQ (Area Combined Headquarters) for A/S operations in the Atlantic. Organisation and inter-service was born, and became the ‘nerve centre’ of the Atlantic war. However, the units still required ASV, means of illuminating, and attacking targets, not mention aircraft with endurance. The Air Ministry refused. RAF Fighter Command was to receive the priority, to make good losses from the Battle of Britain. During 1 October to 1 December 1940, 100 Allied ships were sunk. In the First Happy Time, May 1940 to 2 December 1940, the U-boats sank 298 ships for more than 1.6 million tons, almost all in the Northwest Approaches. This included 37 tankers (27 British). Most of these kills were made by 18 U-boats. This success was achieved {{without the help of}} the Luftwaffe, which had itself, failed <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> importance of maritime aviation. Meaningful German convoy reconnaissance had been nonexistent.|$|E

5|$|After a {{month of}} training, McKinley and the 23rd Ohio, now led by Colonel Eliakim P. Scammon, set out for western Virginia (today part of West Virginia) in July 1861 {{as a part of}} the Kanawha Division. McKinley {{initially}} thought Scammon was a martinet, but when the regiment finally saw battle, he came <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> value of their relentless drilling. Their first contact with the enemy came in September when they drove back Confederate troops at Carnifex Ferry in present-day West Virginia. Three days after the battle, McKinley was assigned to duty in the brigade quartermaster office, where he worked both to supply his regiment, and as a clerk. In November, the regiment established winter quarters near Fayetteville (today in West Virginia). McKinley spent the winter substituting for a commissary sergeant who was ill, and in April 1862 he was promoted to that rank. The regiment resumed its advance that spring with Hayes in command (Scammon by then led the brigade) and fought several minor engagements against the rebel forces.|$|E
5|$|Beginning <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that}} Bapaume {{may have to}} be {{directly}} attacked, Russell, encouraged by Harper, the commander of IV Corps, began drawing up plans to do so on 29 August, using the 1st Wellington Battalion, of 1st Infantry Brigade. However, it was still hoped that the Germans would withdraw on their own initiative. The bombardment on Bapaume continued into 28 August while 1st Infantry Brigade moved in close to the town on its southern frontage. Particularly heavy barrages were made during the evening and it was noted that the German response was relatively muted and by early in the morning of 29 August, there was no gun fire coming from Bapaume. Overnight, Bapaume had been abandoned, a state of affairs confirmed by patrols of the 3rd Rifle Battalion entering the town from the north. They observed retreating Germans making for Bancourt, to the east. Meanwhile, 2nd Auckland Battalion entered Bapaume from the south. Likewise, the Germans had retreated from Thilloy and the 5th Manchester Battalion, of 42nd Division, moved through the village and secured it.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} on the streets of Kolkata, where Ghosh often {{employed}} the art of guerrilla filmmaking (shooting in real locations without any previous knowledge given to onlookers) to avoid unwanted attention. The cinematographer Setu, who had assisted others in the past to shoot documentaries in Kolkata, said that unlike majority of Indian films, Kahaani was shot mostly without artificial light. The film was shot in 64 days, during which the Durga Puja festival of 2010 took place. Shooting locations in Kolkata included Kalighat Metro station, Nonapukur tram depot, Kumartuli, Howrah Bridge, Victoria Memorial, old houses of North Kolkata and others. The climax, which takes place on the night of Vijayadashami (the last day of Durga Puja), was shot on the night of Vijayadashami in the premises of a Barowari (publicly organised) Durga Puja celebration in the Ballygunge neighbourhood of Kolkata. Most of the crowd in the climax were not actors.
