They are a traditional Chinese medicine, with the massive hunting for exports dramatically decreasing their numbers. Information on the genetic diversity of these geckos in Southeast Asia is very limited. This study aims to explore intrapopulation and interpopulation genetic variation and the genetic structure of 16 populations collected from different localities in Thailand, Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Cambodia using multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. Relatively high genetic diversity occurred {{at both the}} intrapopulation and interpopulation levels. Genetic differentiation with FST values ranging between 0. 006 – 0. 892 was found. Five distinct genetic groups of the red-spotted tokay populations could be classified. A group of populations from northern Thailand showed the highest genetic differentiation from the other groups. Moreover, there was a substantial genetic subdivision depending on the genetic groups with FCT= 0. 664 and FSC= 0. 185. This genetic structure is related to geographical distribution and distance between populations, R 2 = 0. 5614, p< 0. 001.

40|$|Although lizards have highly {{sensitive}} ears, {{it is difficult}} to condition them to sound, making standard psychophysical assays of hearing sensitivity impractical. This paper describes non-invasive measurements of the auditory brainstem response (ABR) in both <b>Tokay</b> <b>geckos</b> (Gekko gecko; nocturnal animals, known for their loud vocalizations) and the green anole (Anolis carolinensis, diurnal, non-vocal animals). Hearing sensitivity was measured in 5 geckos and 7 anoles. The lizards were sedated with isoflurane, and ABRs were measured at levels of 1 and 3 % isoflurane. The typical ABR waveform in response to click stimulation showed one prominent and several smaller peaks occurring within 10 ms of the stimulus onset. ABRs to brief tone bursts revealed that geckos and anoles were most sensitive between 1. 6 - 2 kHz and had similar hearing sensitivity up to about 5 kHz (thresholds typically 20 - 50 dB SPL). Above 5 kHz, however, anoles were more than 20 dB more sensitive than geckos and showed a wider range of sensitivity (1 - 7 kHz). Generally, thresholds from ABR audiograms were comparable to those of small birds. Best hearing sensitivity, however, extended over a larger frequency range in lizards than in most bird species.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{commercial}} trade in three reptile species harvested for different purposes in western Indonesia (Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan) for international markets: (1) <b>Tokay</b> <b>geckos,</b> Gekko gecko, traded for medicinal uses, (2) Javan filesnakes, Acrochordus javanicus, harvested for skins, and (3) Asiatic softshell turtles, Amyda cartilaginea, harvested for meat; each species is also exploited for the pet trade, but to a lesser extent. All three species are harvested from wild populations. None of these species are protected by Indonesian law, {{but there is a}} national harvest and export quota system in place to prevent overexploitation. For each species, we collected data from catchers, middlemen and exporters on harvest volumes, catching locales, turn-over and prices, and compared these figures with the quota allocated by the Indonesian authorities. The trade in G. gecko from Central and East Java (3 traders, 2006) amounts to around 1. 2 million individuals annually, greatly exceeding the national quota of 50, 000 G. gecko for the entire year and representing a monetary value for exporters of around one million USD / year. The annual trade in A. javanicus (in five cities in East and South Kalimantan, and North Sumatra, Riau (central Sumatra) and South Sumatra, 2005 – 6) was estimated at around 300, 000 individuals from Kalimantan and 30, 000 from Sumatra, exceeding the national quota of 200, 000 individuals / year and representing a monetary value for exporters of at least three million USD / year.

40|$|Gecko {{adhesion}} {{is expected}} to be temperature insensitive over the range of temperatures typically experienced by geckos. Previous work is limited and equivocal on whether this expectation holds. We tested the temperature dependence of adhesion in <b>Tokay</b> and Day <b>geckos</b> and found that clinging ability at 12 °C was nearly double the clinging ability at 32 °C. However, rather than confirming a simple temperature effect, our data reveal a complex interaction between temperature and humidity that can drive differences in adhesion by as much as two-fold. Our findings have important implications for inferences about the mechanisms underlying the exceptional clinging capabilities of geckos, including whether performance of free-ranging animals is based solely on a dry adhesive model. An understanding of the relative contributions of van der Waals interactions and how humidity and temperature variation affects clinging capacities will be required to test hypotheses about the evolution of gecko toepads and is relevant to the design and manufacture of synthetic mimics...|$|R
40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen rapid {{advancement}} in gecko synthetic adhesives (GSAs) and their performance has also steadily increased. However, there still remains {{a gap between the}} capabilities of current GSAs, and the properties required for GSAs to perform as the gecko does: on natural undulating surfaces with several scales of roughness, in dirty environments where particle contamination is the norm, and for thousands or even tens of thousands of cycles. For continued progress to be made in GSAs, focus must shift from trying to attain high adhesive values under ideal conditions, to exploring the weaknesses in current GSAs and contrasting those with the principles that underpin the success of the natural gecko systems in real world challenging conditions. Here we show results from the testing and simulation of various GSA systems in rough environments, with contaminating particles of varying size and for repeated cycling. We report that with careful geometry and material consideration, large increases in 'real world' performance can be obtained, and in some cases active control can be utilized to increase controllability. To better understand adhesion on macroscopic rough surfaces, we studied the ability of live <b>Tokay</b> <b>Geckos</b> to adhere to an engineered substrate constructed with sinusoidal patterns of varying amplitudes and wavelengths in sizes similar to the dimensions of the toes and lamellae structures (0. 5 to 6 mm). We found shear adhesion was significantly decreased on surfaces that had amplitudes and wavelengths approaching the lamella length and inter-lamella spacing, losing 95 % of shear adhesion over the range tested. We discovered that the toes are capable of adhering to surfaces with amplitudes much larger than their dimensions even without engaging claws, maintaining 60 % of shear adhesion on surfaces with amplitudes of 3 mm. As well, Gecko adhesion can be predicted by the ratio of the lamella dimensions to surface feature dimensions. In addition to setae, remarkable macroscopic-scale features of gecko toes and lamellae that include compliance and passive conformation are necessary to maintain contact, and consequently, generate shear adhesion on macroscopically rough surfaces. Similarly, we sought to understand the impact of surface roughness on the adhesion of two types of GSA arrays: those with hemispherical shaped tips and those with spatula shaped tips. Our simulations showed that the nanoscale geometry of the tip shape dramatically alters the macroscale adhesion of the array, and that on sinusoidal surfaces with roughness much larger than the nanoscale features, there is still a clear benefit to having spatula shaped features. Similar to experimental results found with the macroscale features of the gecko adhesive system, when roughness approaches the size of the fiber features, adhesion drops dramatically. We have also investigated the impact of two design parameters on the dry self-cleaning capability of GSAs by experimentally testing two GSAs after fouling with small (1 micron), medium (3 - 10 microns) and large (40 - 50 microns) particles. We found that a GSA made from a hard thermoplastic with nanoscopic fibers was able to recover 96 - 115 % of its shear adhesion after fouling with small and large but not medium particles, while a GSA made from a soft polymer and microscopic fibers recovered 40 - 55 % on medium and large particles. Further examination by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the soft polymer structures were not shedding the smaller particles during recovery steps, but were instead being absorbed into the surface, and that, regardless of their size, particles did not release from the soft polymer surface. An analysis of the contact strength between fibers, particles and substrates of various dimensions and elasticity reveals that dry self-cleaning will be more effective for GSAs fabricated with smaller fiber diameters and for GSAs fabricated from materials with smaller loss functions, such as hard thermoplastics. This has important implications on the choice of materials and geometries used for GSAs when dry self-cleaning capability is a desired function in the material, and indicates that hard polymer GSAs with smaller fiber diameters are less prone to fouling. As indicated by results of dry self-cleaning on a passive soft polymer fibrillar adhesive, we set out to design a system with active control and release of particles. We have demonstrated controllable adhesion to glass spheres with a new magnetically actuated synthetic gecko adhesive made from a magnetoelastomer composite. Capable of controlling adhesion to glass spheres 500 microns to 1 mm, this represents an important step in realizing an adhesive with dry self-cleaning capabilities across a wide range of particle sizes. We also examined the behavior of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) microfiber arrays during repeated cycles of engagement on a glass surface, with normal preload less than 40 kPa. We found that fiber arrays maintained 54 % of the original shear stress of 300 kPa after 10, 000 cycles, despite showing marked plastic deformation of fiber tips. This deformation was attributed to shear induced plastic creep of the fiber tips from high adhesion forces, adhesive wear or thermal effects. We hypothesize that a fundamental material limit has been reached for these fiber arrays, and that future gecko synthetic adhesive designs must take into account the high adhesive forces generated to avoid damage. Although the synthetic material and natural gecko arrays have a similar elastic modulus, the synthetic material does not show the same wear-free dynamic friction as the gecko. The discovery of this wear mechanism has uncovered a possible pathway to the fabrication of nanoscale spatula shaped tips. Spatula tips have been shown by the rough surface simulation to greatly improve adhesion strength. Several possible fabrication pathways are proposed and preliminary results on these fabrication techniques are presented...|$|R

5000|$|The {{possibilities}} finally narrowed down to intermolecular forces, and {{the development}} of electron microscopy in the 1950s, which revealed the micro-structure of the setae on the gecko's foot, provided further proof to support this hypothesis. The problem was finally solved in 2000 by a research team led by biologists Kellar Autumn of Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon, and Robert Full at the University of California at Berkeley. They showed that the underside of a gecko toe typically bears a series of ridges, which are covered with uniform ranks of setae, and each seta further divides into hundreds of split ends and flat tips called spatulas (see figure on the right). A single seta of the <b>tokay</b> <b>gecko</b> is roughly 110 micrometers long and 4.2 micrometers wide. Each of a seta's branches ends in a thin, triangular spatula connected at its apex. The end is about 0.2 micrometers long and 0.2 micrometers wide. The adhesion between gecko's foot and the surfaces is exactly the result of the Van der Waals force between each seta and the surface molecules. A single seta can generate up to 200N of force There are about 14,400 setae per square millimeter on the foot of a <b>tokay</b> <b>gecko,</b> which leads to a total number of about 3,268,800 setae on a tokay gecko's two front feet. From the equation for intermolecular potential:where [...] and [...] are the number of contacts of the two surfaces, R is the radius of each contact and D is the distance between the two surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|Gekko's seta: According to Kellar Autumn, [...] "Two front {{feet of a}} <b>tokay</b> <b>gecko</b> (Gekko gecko) can {{withstand}} 20.1 N of force parallel to the surface with 227 mm2 of pad area (Irschick et al. 1996). The foot of a tokay bears approximately 3600 tetrads of setae per mm2, or 14,400 setae per mm2 (Schleich and Kastle 1986; pers- obs-)- Consequently, a single seta should produce an average force of 6-2 pN, and an average shear stress of 0-090 N mm−l (0.9 atm). However, single setae proved both much less sticky and much more sticky than predicted by whole animal measurements, under varying experimental conditions, implying that attachment and detachment in gecko setae are mechanically controlled (Autumn et al. 2000)." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{two front}} {{feet of a}} <b>tokay</b> <b>gecko</b> can {{withstand}} 20.1 N of force parallel to the surface with 227 mm2 of pad area, a force as much as 40 times the gecko's weight. Scientists have been investigating the secret of this extraordinary adhesion ever since the 19th century, and at least seven possible mechanisms for gecko adhesion have been discussed over the past 175 years. There have been hypotheses of glue, friction, suction, electrostatics, micro-interlocking and intermolecular forces. Sticky secretions were ruled out first early {{in the study of}} gecko adhesion since geckos lack glandular tissue on their toes. The friction hypothesis was also dismissed quickly because the friction force only acts in shear which cannot explain the adhesive capabilities of geckos on inverted surfaces. The hypothesis that the toe pads act as suction cups was dispelled in 1934 by experiments carried out in a vacuum in which the gecko's toes remained stuck. Similarly, the electrostatic hypothesis was refuted by an experiment showing that geckos could still adhere even when the build-up of electrostatic charge was impossible (such as on a metal surface in air ionized by a stream of x-rays). The mechanism of microinterlocking which suggested that the curved tips of setae could act as microscale hooks was also challenged by the fact that geckos generate large adhesive forces even on molecularly smooth surfaces.|$|E

The crowding model is applied to the setal arrays of the <b>tokay</b> <b>gecko.</b> Good agree-ment is found between the predictions of the crowding model (a critical tilt angle of hc 12. 6 to the substrate corresponding to a vertical compression of Dz 49 lm of the setae within the setal array) and experimental data for the compression of <b>tokay</b> <b>gecko</b> setal arrays.
