5|$|In 1929 {{the company}} asked HM Treasury for an {{extension}} of the period in which government loans to the company could be paid. The Treasury first demanded an audit of the company accounts, and sent Sir William McClintock to write a report on the financial state of the company. McClintock's report revealed that the company had not earned any <b>trading</b> <b>profits</b> since 1925, but was still paying dividends by taking money from the reserves. The company had reported £439,000 profits for 1926, but had drawn £750,000 out of the reserves and falsified accounts to make it appear that the money came from trading. In 1927 the company made a trading loss of £507,000, but money was again drawn from the reserves to make it appear that the company had made a profit of £478,000. As a result of this, and a report that in 1928 the company had issued a fraudulent prospectus inviting customers to buy shares in the company and saying that it had earned an average £500,000 a year in the last decade, arrest warrants were issued for Lord Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor. At the time the ruse was discovered the company had a trading deficit of £300,000 a year, the reserves were completely exhausted, and the company owed £10 million.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a collection}} of three essays that investigate the momentum effect and the short-run predictability in currency carry <b>trade</b> <b>profits.</b> The first essay investigates whether tail risks of momentum strategies make them unattractive within the context of prospect utility. Momentum returns have strongly asymmetric tail risks and that asymmetric tail risk is precisely what makes momentum strategies unattractive. This study is the first to document the undesirable tail risk characteristics of momentum returns. The second essay uncovers economically significant predictability in carry <b>trade</b> <b>profits</b> from shorting the low-yielding currencies. The monthly world equity index return, monthly changes in currency volatility and monthly changes in equity volatility predict carry <b>trade</b> <b>profits</b> from the short leg two months later, while monthly changes in commodity prices, monthly changes in currency volatility and monthly changes in equity volatility predict carry <b>trade</b> <b>profits</b> from the long leg three months later. Investors could have used the discovered leg-specific predictability to time the market and improve their trading outcomes, instead of staying fully invested or predicting carry <b>trade</b> <b>profits</b> from both legs with a single model. Evidence from two tests conducted in this essay points towards the gradual information diffusion model as the most likely explanation for the discovered predictability, while timevarying risk premia do not seem to explain this effect. The last essay examines return predictability among carry trades, stocks and commodities in a dynamic vector autoregression setting. The predictive effect goes from commodities to stock, from stocks to low-yielding currencies and from commodities to high-yielding currencies. Variables in these markets are more strongly correlated in the high-risk regime than in the low-risk regime. Drops in the world equity index (commodity prices), but not rises, predict decreases in carry <b>trade</b> <b>profits</b> from low-yielding (high-yielding) currencies. Increases in currency volatility, but not decreases, predict drops in carry <b>trade</b> <b>profits</b> from low-yielding currencies. The in- sample asymmetric effects also exist out-of-sample, but these asymmetric prediction models do not consistently deliver better forecasts than symmetric models...|$|R

40|$|Odean [1999] {{observes that}} naive investors tend to trade too often, {{but we know}} little about what motivates them and why their {{performance}} is often so poor. This paper describes an experiment where naive traders {{take part in a}} share market game with limited information, unlimited credit, and unlimited short-selling. We find that <b>trading</b> <b>profit</b> volatility is positively correlated with the level of understanding of the market, the level of self-efficacy or self-confidence, and the level of <b>trading.</b> Large <b>profits</b> and losses tend to be earned by individuals who trade heavily and have a reasonable understanding of how the market works and how shares are valued. There is also some evidence that a high level of self-efficacy is positively correlated with <b>trading</b> <b>profit</b> volatility...|$|R
2500|$|A gradual {{economic}} shift {{occurred during}} the Muradid era (c.1630s–1702), as corsair raiding decreased due to pressure from Europe, and commercial trading based on agricultural products (chiefly grains) increased due to an integration of the rural population into regional networks. Mediterranean trade, however, continued to be carried by European shipping companies. The Beys, in order to derive the maximum advantage from the export trade, instituted government monopolies which mediated between the local producers and foreign merchants. As a result, the rulers and their business partners (drawn from foreign-dominated elites well-connected to the Turkish-speaking ruling caste) took {{a disproportionate share of}} Tunisia's <b>trading</b> <b>profits.</b> This precluded the development of local business interests, whether rural landowners or a wealthy merchant strata.

40|$|Abstract — The {{starting}} point for this paper is the control theoretic paradigm for stock trading developed in [1]. Within this framework, a so-called idealized market is characterized by continuous trading and smooth stock price variations. Subsequently, a feedback controller processes the stock price history p(t) to determine {{the current level of}} investment I(t). In this idealized setting, we show that feedback control laws exist which guarantee a profit for all admissible price variations. This first result is only viewed as a benchmark because the controller which achieves this <b>trading</b> <b>profit</b> relies on price signal differentiation which is undesirable. Subsequently, the paper concentrates on more practical differentiator-free controller dynamics. For the simple case of a static linear feedback on the cumulative <b>trading</b> <b>profit</b> or loss g(t), surprisingly, it turns out that a profit is still guaranteed. The final part of the paper involves numerical simulation using historical price; we study {{the extent to which the}} idealized market results carry over to real markets. I...|$|R
