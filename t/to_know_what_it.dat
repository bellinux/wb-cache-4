Schmid's girlfriend Mary French had convinced Rowe to go out with Schmid's friend John Saunders, but Schmid had intended all along to murder Rowe, in order <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> felt like to kill someone.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Tansley {{had a dream}} {{where he}} shot his wife. He wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> meant, so he studied Sigmund Freud. However, one part of Freud's theory was that the human brain is an {{electrical}} machine. Tansley became convinced that, as the brain was interconnected, so was {{the whole of the}} natural world, in networks he called ecosystems, which he believed were inherently stable and self-correcting, and which regulated nature {{as if it were a}} machine.|$|E
25|$|While {{in prison}} he was {{transferred}} to the Bridgewater State Hospital. On March 22, 1984, he changed his name to Nathaniel Benjamin Levi Bar-Jonah. He gave several reasons for changing his name. Bar-Jonah told friends and relatives that he changed his name because he wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was like to be discriminated against and persecuted as a Jew. During a later interview with Dr. Michael Stone for the television show Most Evil, he claimed he was Jewish and wanted his name to reflect that. Later in the same year, Superior Court Judge Walter E. Steele ruled that Massachusetts had failed to prove that Bar-Jonah was dangerous and he was released before moving to Great Falls, Montana. During this time, Bar-Jonah confided in his psychiatrists that he had a deep fascination and curiosity with the taste of human flesh, and had innumerable murderous fantasies.|$|E

25|$|Kant then asks {{why we have}} {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of morality. He is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so”. He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws” but wonders how this is possible. He then explains just how it is possible, by appealing to the two perspectives that we can consider ourselves under. According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god's-eye perspective. From this god's-eye perspective the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of our heads and leave our human perspective on the world <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about how the world appears to us, not about how the world is in itself. Kant calls the world as it appears to us {{from our point of view}} the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god's-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding”. It is the distinction between these two perspectives that Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take ourselves to be exercising our free will, Kant argues, we have to consider ourselves from the perspective of the world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there is no room for a free will to change the course of events. If you consider yourself as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think of yourself as having a will that brings things about.|$|E
500|$|Guillory {{explained}} that she [...] "became an actor because I wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{was like to be}} other people. Because possibly I don't like myself", and later said [...] "I hate acting, really hate it. I kind of fell into it sideways ... I started acting because I got offered a job when I was 16, and they wanted to pay me £8,000, and we'd always lived on Family Support". She {{went on to say that}} her frustration with later film roles left her bitter, but after seeing Helen Mirren onstage she was inspired again.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} [...] "No Russian" [...] was {{conceived}} {{during the initial}} brainstorming sessions for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 plot. The developers at Infinity Ward wanted to discuss how terrorists operate in the modern era, and sought to create an unimaginable, albeit plausible scenario that the player would feel uncomfortable in. Lead writer Jesse Stern noted that despite the grim subject matter, people instinctively want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is like to experience these attacks, and cited documentaries about the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the Columbine High School massacre as evidence. According to Stern: [...] "These are human beings who perpetrate these acts, so you don't really want to {{turn a blind eye}} to it. You want to take it apart and figure out how that happened and what, if anything, can be done to prevent it. Ultimately, our intention was to put you as close as possible to atrocity." ...|$|E

500|$|David reduced {{her writing}} {{commitments}} {{to concentrate on}} running the shop, but contributed some articles to magazines, and began {{to focus more on}} English cuisine. She still included many recipes but increasingly wrote about places—markets, , farms—and people, including profiles of famous chefs and gourmets such as Marcel Boulestin and Édouard de Pomiane. In her later articles, she expressed strongly held views {{on a wide range of}} subjects; she abominated the word [...] "crispy", demanding <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> conveyed that [...] "crisp" [...] did not; she confessed to an inability to refill anybody's wineglass until it was empty; she insisted on the traditional form [...] "Welsh rabbit" [...] rather than the modern invention [...] "Welsh rarebit"; she poured scorn on the Guide Michelin's standards; she deplored [...] "fussy garnish... distract from the main flavours"; she inveighed against the ersatz: [...] "anyone depraved enough to invent a dish consisting of a wedge of steam-heated bread spread with tomato paste and a piece of synthetic Cheddar can call it a pizza." ...|$|E
500|$|While in Paris, Lana {{begins a}} new romantic {{relationship}} with Jason Teague. Kreuk believes that Lana did love Jason Teague, {{but she also}} still loved Clark at the same time. With Clark, it was the [...] "first love" [...] that she never {{had the chance to}} discover, and that lingered with her while she was in Paris during the space between seasons three and four. According to Kreuk, before Lana can experience successful relationships with other people she will need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is like to truly be in a relationship with Clark, because of the [...] "intense connection between [...] two". Allison Mack shares her insight into the relationship between Clark and Lana, believing that the pair should have remained apart until they could finally be honest with each other: [...] "There's no honesty in their relationship, and there's no way that they could have a healthy relationship without that honesty [...] You can't be with someone if you're not honest with them." [...] Kreuk echoes Mack's sentiments, acknowledging that Lana is not stupid, and if Clark wants a real relationship then {{he is going to have}} to be honest with her.|$|E
500|$|Settling in London, Geldray took up British citizenship, {{and worked}} {{on a number of}} BBC radio programmes, such as Workers' Playtime, Melody Magazine and Forces' All-Star Bill. In 1951 he {{provided}} the musical interludes for a new BBC series Crazy People, a comedy show that starred Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Michael Bentine. Crazy People changed its name for subsequent series to The Goon Show and Geldray was a regular performer in the remaining nine series. The show followed a successful format of a vague plot interspersed by two musical performances; the BBC were using the same structure for a number of radio series, including It's That Man Again (ITMA). In The Goon Show, the musical segments were taken up by Geldray and The Ray Ellington Quartet, with Geldray also playing [...] "Crazy Rhythm" [...] for the play-out music. On occasions Geldray was given lines to perform, although he felt uncomfortable doing so, and his lack of acting ability became a long-running joke within the programme. Geldray was also the butt of some of the Goons jokes and humour: he was referred to throughout the programmes as [...] "Conk", on account of his nose, and his performances were often humorously dismissed by the announcer Wallace Greenslade, with such comments as: [...] "That was Mr Max Geldray playing a harmonica. We thought you ought <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was, anyhow." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tradition {{is one of}} the key {{concepts}} in anthropology; it can be said that anthropology is the study of [...] "tradition in traditional societies". There is however no [...] "theory of tradition", as for most anthropologists the need to discuss what tradition is seems unnecessary, as defining tradition is both unnecessary (everyone can be expected <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is) and unimportant (as small differences in definition would be just technical). There are however dissenting views; scholars such as Pascal Boyer argue that defining tradition and developing theories about it are important to the discipline.|$|E
2500|$|The {{immediate}} {{results of}} the operation were disastrous for {{the image of the}} Air Corps. Speaker of the House Henry T. Rainey, echoing comments made by Gen.

If it is not equal to carrying the mail, I would like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> would do in carrying bombs." [...] Despite the public humiliation, the Air Mail Fiasco resulted in a number of improvements for the Air Corps, bringing about changes that its previous publicity campaigns were unable to obtain.|$|E

2500|$|One of history's {{greatest}} financial bubbles {{occurred in}} the next few decades. At the center of it were the South Sea Company, set up in 1711 to conduct English trade with South America, and the Mississippi Company, focused on commerce with France's Louisiana colony and touted by transplanted Scottish financier John Law, who was acting in effect as France's central banker. Investors snapped up shares in both, and whatever else was available.
