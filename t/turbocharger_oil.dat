40|$|For micro gas {{turbines}} (MGT) of around 1 kW or less, a commercially suitable recuperator {{must be used}} to produce a thermal efficiency suitable for use in UK Domestic Combined Heat and Power (DCHP). This paper uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to investigate a recuperator design based on a helically coiled pipe-in-pipe heat exchanger which utilises industry standard stock materials and manufacturing techniques. A suitable mesh strategy was established by geometrically modelling separate boundary layer volumes to satisfy y + near wall conditions. A higher mesh density was then used to resolve the core flow. A coiled pipe-in-pipe recuperator solution for a 1 kW MGT DCHP unit was established within the volume envelope suitable for a domestic wall-hung boiler. Using a low MGT pressure ratio (necessitated by using a <b>turbocharger</b> <b>oil</b> cooled journal bearing platform) meant unit size was larger than anticipated. Raising MGT pressure ratio from 2. 15 to 2. 5 could significantly reduce recuperator volume. Dimensional reasoning confirmed the existence of optimum pipe diameter combinations for minimum pressure drop. Maximum heat exchanger effectiveness was achieved using an optimum or minimum pressure drop pipe combination with large pipe length {{as opposed to a}} large pressure drop pipe combination with shorter pipe length...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of an engine with constant power for SAEâ€™s student Formula race-car competition, allowing the avoidance of gear shifting {{for much of the}} Autocross event. To achieve constant power for over 50 % of the speed range, turbocharging was adopted with a boost pressure ratio of 2. 8 at mid-range speeds and applied to an engine capacity of 430 cc. This engine was specifically designed and configured for the purpose, being a twin cylinder in-line arrangement with double overhead camshafts. Most of the engine components were specially cast or machined from billets. The capacity was selected to minimise frictional losses and thus increase delivered power along with dry sump lubrication and a three speed gear box. The engine manifolds and plenums were designed using a CAE application and proved to be well suited to the task resulting in excellent agreement between predicted and actual performance. One of the major challenges of the experimental development was overcoming the <b>turbocharger</b> <b>oil</b> consumption under throttled operation at part load conditions and at full power when the FSAE restrictor is choked. For the 2004 Australian competition the engine was run with slightly reduced mid speed power to avoid excessive use of the traction control system and was very competitive finishing first in the fuel economy event.

In 1986, the 75 Turbo was introduced, which featured a fuel-injected 1779 cc twin-cam engine using Garrett T3 <b>turbocharger,</b> intercooler and <b>oil</b> cooler.|$|R
50|$|Treated {{fresh water}} {{is used for}} cooling of the cylinder, charge air, <b>turbocharger,</b> and <b>oil.</b> Freshwater cooling {{is divided into two}} systems the HT (High Temperature) cooling the {{cylinders}} and turbocharger and the LT (Low Temperature) cooling the oil and charge air. The freshwater temperature is closely regulated with a thermostatic valve to achieve optimum efficiency. At low engine loads the charge can be too cool, which can cause incomplete combustion. To counteract this heat rejected to the lubrication oil can be used to heat the freshwater, which in turn heats the charge air enough to ensure complete combustion.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years, the {{increasing}} {{concern for the}} environmental issues of IC engines has promoted {{the development of new}} strategies capable of reducing both pollutant emissions in atmosphere and noise radiation. Engines can produce different types of noise: 1) aerodynamic noise due to intake and exhaust systems and 2) surface radiated noise. Identification and analysis of noise sources are essential to evaluate the individual contribution (injection, combustion, piston slap, <b>turbocharger,</b> <b>oil</b> pump, valves) to the overall noise with the aim of selecting appropriate control strategies. Previous paper focused on the combustion related noise emission. The research activity aimed at diagnosing and controlling the combustion process via acoustic measurements. The optimal placement of the microphone was selected, where the signal was strongly correlated to the in-cylinder pressure development during the combustion process. Analysis and processing of the sound emission allowed the acoustic contribution of the combustion event to be isolated. Some indices capable of relating the combustion noise radiation back to the combustion development were defined. This paper presents an experimental activity devoted to analyze the entire noise generation process of a small displacement diesel engine. The purpose was to identify the contribution of the different sources (mechanical, combustion, fluid dynamic) to the overall emission. The methodology here proposed analyze the specific signature in the frequency domain of each source. The final objective was to use the microphone signal acquired in a proper selected location, to obtain indications about the effective strategies to achieve noise reduction. The repetitiveness of the measurements was guaranteed by a network encircling the engine. Microphones were placed in different positions and tests were performed in the complete engine operative field. In the paper, the experimental set-up is described, the methodology is presented. Results are then shown and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Besides {{pollutant}} emissions, {{fuel consumption}} and performance, vehicle NVH constitutes a further object during engine development and optimization. In recent years, research activity for diesel {{engine noise reduction}} {{has been devoted to}} investigate aerodynamic noise due to intake and exhaust systems and surface radiated noise. Most of the attention has been concerned with the identification and analysis of noise sources in order to evaluate the individual contribution (injection, combustion, piston slap, <b>turbocharger,</b> <b>oil</b> pump, valves) to the overall noise with the aim of selecting appropriate control strategies. Several studies have been devoted to analyze combustion process that has a direct influence on engine noise emission; the impact of injection strategies on the combustion noise has been evaluated and approaches able to separate engine combustion and mechanical noise components have been presented. This work fits in a research program that aims at analyzing the engine noise emission for both the combustion diagnosis via non-intrusive sensors and the definition of potential strategies for combustion related noise emission improvement. Previous works have been devoted to analyze the entire noise generation process of a diesel engine in order to identify the contribution of the different sources to the overall emission and to investigate the correlation between noise radiation and in-cylinder pressure measurement aimed at assessing the in-cylinder pressure development during the combustion process via its related emission. Therefore, during such activity, the attention was focused on the excitation forces and on their effect, the radiated noise. This work has been devoted to deeper insight into the structural response of the engine, that represents the transfer function between in-cylinder pressure and radiated noise. A small displacement common-rail diesel engine has been fully instrumented and its noise radiation has been investigated by analyzing the signals of microphones placed in selected locations around the engine. A method in the frequency domain is presented for evaluating the engine structural response function; the engine is considered as a black box in which the input is the in-cylinder pressure and the output is the noise radiation. Once the dynamic response of the engine is estimated, combustion development can be characterized via the engine noise radiation, thus allowing to get indication about possible strategies for noise emission improvement, that could be obtained through structural modification and/or combustion process control by injection strategy variation...|$|E
