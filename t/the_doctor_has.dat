5|$|The Doctor {{returns to}} town, and angrily drags Jex {{to face the}} Gunslinger. Amy asserts that <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> changed for the worse from months of {{travelling}} on his own. Jex pleads that he has atoned, but the cyborg prepares to kill him. Isaac pushes Jex {{out of the way}} and takes the lethal shot. As he dies, Isaac gives the Doctor his marshal badge and has him promise to protect Mercy. The Gunslinger departs, warning he will return for Jex at noon tomorrow.|$|E
5|$|Amy and Rory {{discover}} that the wounded Doctor had told his earlier self to create a diversion, allowing him to rig the Pandorica to fly into the TARDIS explosion. The Doctor postulates that enough of the original universe still exists in the Pandorica to completely restore it via the exploding TARDIS. After a tearful farewell to Amy, Rory, and River where he instructs Amy to focus on her family and Rory to restore them in the new universe, the Doctor engages the Pandorica and flies it into the exploding TARDIS. A second Big Bang occurs. The Doctor comes to consciousness and begins witnessing events in his life in reverse as {{the cracks in the}} universe close. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> to stay outside this new universe in order for that to happen. After a final goodbye to Amelia on the night they met, he enters the cracks and disappears.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, {{the mysterious}} {{character}} River Song (Alex Kingston) summons alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) to Roman Britain in 102 AD, where underneath Stonehenge lies a fabled prison called the Pandorica that legend tells holds the most fearsome {{being in the}} whole universe. However, it is discovered that <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> been put in a trap by an alliance of his greatest enemies to save the universe from cracks in time that were caused by the Doctor's space-time vessel the TARDIS. Amy's fiancé, Rory (Arthur Darvill), who had previously been erased from existence {{from one of the}} cracks in the universe, makes a return, though he is revealed to be an Auton duplicate outfitted with his consciousness.|$|E

60|$|Could she {{possibly}} {{come out}} by the next train? Bailey was very ill. Bailey was dying. Bailey had come home last night looking ghastly. He had not slept. In the early morning {{he had begun to}} babble--Mrs. Bailey's voice had risen and broken on the word, and Ruth {{at the other end of}} the wire had heard her frightened sobs. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>had</b> come. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>had</b> looked awfully grave. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>had</b> telephoned to New York for another doctor. They were both upstairs now. It was awful, and Ruth must come at once.|$|R
5|$|River refuses the Doctor's {{offer to}} travel with him, {{returning}} to her Stormcage prison {{in order to keep}} a promise. She kisses the Doctor goodbye, and as <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> never kissed her before she deduces that this will be her last kiss with him. In the TARDIS, Amy appears unable to remember seeing her picture in the orphanage and says that she told the Doctor, rather than Rory, when she believed she was pregnant, through fears that travelling in the TARDIS might have affected her child's development. As the trio sets off, the Doctor discreetly uses the TARDIS scanner to attempt to determine if Amy is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|While the Doctor works, Amy {{sees the}} mysterious figure again, and excuses {{herself to the}} restroom. There, the figure, {{a member of a}} species known as the Silence, waits for her and kills an {{innocent}} woman despite Amy's pleas. Realising the alien is wiping her memory of their encounters, Amy takes a picture of the alien. When she leaves the restroom, however, she yet again forgets the encounter. By then <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> found the girl's location, a building near Cape Canaveral, Florida, at the intersection to streets named Jefferson, Adams, and Hamilton. The Doctor and his companions leave in the TARDIS, followed closely by a curious Delaware.|$|E
5|$|Old Kazran is soon {{visited by}} {{holographic}} {{images of the}} ship's crew in the present. After observing the effects of Abigail's singing, the crew is singing Christmas carols, the sound frequencies of which are helping to stabilise the ship but cannot prevent it from crashing. Amy appears to Kazran and implores his help, but he waves away the holograms. The Doctor appears, and Kazran surmises that he is there to show Kazran his future, {{but he could not}} care less if he dies old and alone; he reveals that Abigail had an incurable disease on entering cryostorage and will only have one more day to live. As he cannot decide which day that should be, Kazran chastises the Doctor for believing he could change his mind. Unbeknownst to Kazran, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> brought young Kazran with him; the realisation of how much his bitter future self now resembles his feared father causes a change of heart in Kazran (making his own memory of his future self the show's version of the ghost of Christmas yet to come), and he quickly agrees to release the controls to save the ship.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor {{manages to}} contact UNIT to {{coordinate}} efforts {{of how to}} return the other passengers safely to Earth. The Doctor and Christina scout ahead, while the others attempt to repair the bus. The Doctor and Christina spot a sandstorm on the horizon when they are met by two Tritovores, a species resembling anthropomorphic flies, who take them to their wrecked spaceship. They explain they were delivering a shipment to San Helios, which had housed over hundred billion just recently but now is desert wherever they scan. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> them scan the approaching sandstorm and finds {{it really is a}} swarm of stingray-like aliens that are destroying the ecosystem. He suspects they are generating the wormhole to travel to their next planet to feed upon, and they must hurry and close the wormhole before they can reach Earth. Christina uses her burglary skills to obtain a power crystal and its mounting from the Tritovore ship, but accidentally wakes an alien stingray, which consumes the Tritovores.|$|E
5|$|The story {{involved}} a strange force compelling Jamie to pilot the TARDIS to Scotland in 1746 where the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe find themselves isolated from their ship by a forcefield. They {{arrive at the}} foreboding Castle McCrimmon, Jamie's ancestral home near a misty loch. There they are met by Duncan, Factor to the ailing Laird, Sir James McCrimmon. Jamie shows Zoe around and she notices some strange cattle which then stand up - they are Yeti. The Yeti isolate the castle and the villagers fall {{under the influence of}} the Great Intelligence. One villager, Fiona, is immune and Jamie falls in love with her. The Intelligence aims to gain control of Jamie's body and settle in the castle as the Laird of McCrimmon when Sir James dies. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> to determine who the Intelligence is working through, with the Laird and the village sorceress being the prime candidates. It transpires that Duncan is protecting Fiona's mother, Morag - a woman with second sight. The Intelligence is defeated and, after Sir James dies with no heirs, Jamie is the last of the clan and is therefore the obvious choice for the new Laird. Accepting his rightful inheritance and responsibility, Jamie bids a reluctant farewell to the Doctor and Zoe to remain with Fiona as the new Laird.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} saved Curly Brace earlier, the player may find an item to restore her memories. She remembers that the player character's name is Quote, {{and that they}} were not the killer robots who {{slaughtered}} Mimigas in the past. Instead, they were sent to destroy the Demon Crown to prevent its power from falling into the wrong hands. Quote finds Sue's mother, Momorin, who is building a rocket that will allow access {{to the top of the}} island where the Doctor resides. After helping her complete the rocket, Quote confronts Misery and the Doctor. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> purified the essence of the red flowers into a crystal, which allows him to survive even after Quote destroys his body. The Doctor's spirit possesses the Core of the island, but Quote succeeds in destroying that as well, causing the island to begin falling to Earth. Should the player have saved Curly and restored her memories, they may proceed into a bonus stage called the Bloodstained Sanctuary where Curly can be found and rescued; it is also here that Ballos - creator of the Demon Crown and Jenka's younger brother - is imprisoned. A powerful wizard who went insane and destroyed his homeland after being tortured by a jealous king, Ballos was sealed deep within the island by his sister. At some point, his niece Misery forced him to create the demon crown, but she and Balrog became cursed to serve whoever possessed it. Additionally, it is stated via narration that the Demon Crown will repair itself if it is destroyed, and will only truly lose its power if Ballos is killed, necessitating that Quote and Curly take his life.|$|E

5|$|Misery banishes {{the player}} to the Labyrinth {{deep inside the}} island as {{punishment}} for interfering with the Doctor's plans. Curly Brace has also been thrown into the Labyrinth and they cooperate to escape. Balrog helps them to move the boulder blocking the exit, revealing his kind nature. The pair find and defeat the Core, a magical creature whose power keeps the island afloat. However, the Doctor steps in to save it before the island collapses. Depending on certain conditions, the player may rescue Curly Brace, who had sacrificed her air tank to save the player character. When he returns to Mimiga Village, he finds that <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> captured the Mimigas. In the Egg Corridor, Kazuma offers the player a choice to escape the island with him using a Sky Dragon, leading to an alternate ending in which the Doctor conquers the surface world while Kazuma and the player hide in the mountains. The player may instead choose to confront the Doctor and destroy the island's Core, which would return the Mimigas to normal. The player scales the outer wall of the island to reach the Plantation where the Doctor is using the Mimigas as slave laborers to grow red flowers. The Doctor's servants capture the player and place him in a jail cell with Sue. She is taken away before the player wakes up, but her letter reveals that the Doctor {{was a member of}} the research expedition that included Sue's family and Professor Booster, but he betrayed them once he found the Demon Crown. Sue directs the player to find her mother who may have a plan to stop the Doctor.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> a {{deep sense}} of right and wrong, and a {{conviction}} that it is right to intervene when injustice occurs, which sets him apart from his own people, the Time Lords, and their strict ethic of non-intervention.|$|E

To restore society, he creates reality testing labs to discover Doctor Hoffman's secret methods.|$|E

He believes that despite the horror, evil and destruction that the Daleks would inflict on the universe, ultimately there must be 'some greater good'.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} serials The Edge of Destruction and The Sensorites, it {{appeared}} that the First Doctor had only a single heart. It was not until the Third Doctor serial Spearhead from Space that the programme's then-writers came up with the concept that <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> two hearts. The tie-in novel The Man in the Velvet Mask states (incorporating an explanation for the discrepancy from fan lore) that the Doctor did not grow his second heart until his regeneration into the Second Doctor.|$|E
25|$|On rare occasions, {{other actors}} have stood {{in for the}} lead. In The Five Doctors, Richard Hurndall played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975. In Time and the Rani, Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the {{regeneration}} sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. For more information, see the list of actors who have played the Doctor. In other media, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> been played by various other actors, including Peter Cushing in two films.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{of absence}} is {{evidence}} of any kind {{that can be used}} to infer or deduce the non-existence or non-presence of something. For instance, if a doctor does not find any malignant cells in a patient this null result (finding nothing) {{is evidence of}} absence of cancer, even though <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>has</b> not actually detected anything per se. Such inductive reasoning is important to empiricism and science, but has well established limitations. The challenge thus becomes to try to identify when a researcher has received a null result (found nothing) because the thing does not exist (evidence of absence—objectively negative result), and when one simply lacks proper means of detection (absence of evidence—false negative).|$|E
25|$|The Doctor often finds {{events that}} pique his curiosity {{as he tries}} to prevent evil forces from harming {{innocent}} people or changing history, using only his ingenuity and minimal resources, such as his versatile sonic screwdriver. He rarely travels alone and often brings one or more companions to share these adventures. His companions are usually humans, as he has found a fascination with planet Earth, and he frequently collaborates with the international military task force UNIT when the Earth itself is threatened. As a Time Lord, the Doctor is centuries-old and has the ability to regenerate when his body is mortally damaged, taking on a new appearance and personality. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> gained numerous reoccurring enemies during his travels, including the Daleks, the Cybermen, and the Master, another renegade Time Lord.|$|E
25|$|In a story arc {{stretching}} {{through several}} of the Eighth Doctor Adventures, sometime in the Doctor's future, a war is fought between the Time Lords and an unnamed Enemy, the Eighth Doctor becoming involved in {{the events of the}} war during the events of Alien Bodies, when he unintentionally becomes involved in an auction for the body of his future self due to his biodata codes being the only means of accessing dangerous Time Lord secrets, and The Taking of Planet 5, where he must stop a group of future Time Lords from releasing the monstrous Fendahl in an attempt {{to use it as a}} weapon. In this story arc, Gallifrey is also destroyed as a result of the Eighth Doctor attempting to prevent the war from beginning as the Enemy begin their first assault in, having learned that he unintentionally provoked the War, believing that it would be better for the Time Lords to die now rather than experience a war that would dehumanise them to the point of becoming monsters which all evidence suggests they could not win. This cataclysm also creates an event horizon in time that prevents anyone from entering Gallifrey's relative past or travelling from it to the present or future. The last Eighth Doctor Adventures novel, The Gallifrey Chronicles, establishes that <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> the ability to restore the planet and its inhabitants, having downloaded the contents of the Matrix into his subconscious mind in the minutes before Gallifrey's destruction, albeit at the cost of his own memories. The novel ends without revealing if he does indeed do this.|$|E
