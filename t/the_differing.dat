Among the methods that are {{or have been}} used are: solvent extraction (using various extractants, usually multidentate β-diketone derivatives, organophosphorus compounds, and amine compounds), chromatography using various ion-exchange or chelating resins, coprecipitation (possible matrices include LaF3, BiPO4, BaSO4, Fe(OH)3, and MnO2), electrodeposition, and biotechnological methods. Currently, commercial reprocessing plants use the Purex process, involving the solvent extraction of uranium and plutonium with tributyl phosphate.|$|E

In order to ensure itself of the good behavior of an element or a concrete structure reinforced in service and with the absolute limit, {{it is necessary to}} correctly evaluate <b>the</b> instantaneous and <b>differed</b> deformations and displacements. Within the framework of this study one is interested in modeling and simulation of the behaviors instantaneous and differed from a zone bent out of {{reinforced concrete}}. For the simulation of the instantaneous behavior, in composed inflection, an existing program is used and of the complements of validations is realized. For the modeling of <b>the</b> <b>differed</b> behavior, a formulation based on the method of the adjusted effective module is presented. Another data-processing program is developed.

Overall, Durkheim treated suicide {{as a social}} fact, explaining variations in its rate on a macro level, considering society-scale phenomena such as lack of connections between people (group attachment) and lack of regulations of behavior, rather than individuals' feelings and motivations.|$|E

5|$|One {{hypothesis}} is formation by the gravitational instability. Particles several centimeters in size or larger slowly settle {{near the middle}} plane of the disk, forming a very thin—less than 100km—and dense layer. This layer is gravitationally unstable and may fragment into numerous clumps, which in turn collapse into planetesimals. However, <b>the</b> <b>differing</b> velocities of the gas disk and the solids near the mid-plane can generate turbulence which prevents the layer from becoming thin enough to fragment due to gravitational instability. This may limit the formation of planetesimals via gravitational instabilities to specific locations in the disk where the concentration of solids is enhanced.|$|E
5|$|Primarily a coming-of-age story (Bildungsroman) {{and family}} saga, the novel chronicles {{the effect of}} a mutated gene on three generations of a Greek family, causing momentous changes in the protagonist's life.
