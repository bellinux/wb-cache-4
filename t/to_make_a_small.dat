25|$|Nd:YAG laser {{peripheral}} iridotomy (LPI) {{may be used}} {{in patients}} susceptible to or affected by angle closure glaucoma or pigment dispersion syndrome. During laser iridotomy, laser energy is used <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> full-thickness opening in the iris to equalize the pressure between the front and back of the iris, thus correcting any abnormal bulging of the iris. In people with narrow angles, this can uncover the trabecular meshwork. In some cases of intermittent or short-term angle closure, this may lower the eye pressure. Laser iridotomy reduces the risk of developing an attack of acute angle closure. In most cases, it also reduces the risk of developing chronic angle closure or of adhesions of the iris to the trabecular meshwork.|$|E

Based on Ron Howard's recommendation, Lucas hired Jeff Reno and Ron Osborn (known for their work on Moonlighting) to [...] "update" [...] the screenplay. The shooting script was prepared by Lucas, who combined his favorite elements of the Reno/Osborn draft with the original Huyck/Katz script from the 1970s. Lucas then hired Mel Smith to direct, who recommended Brian Benben for the lead role. Lucas specifically choose Smith because he believed the British comedian/filmmaker could handle Radioland Murders form of slapstick comedy and dark humor. Universal was adamant that the ensemble cast be filled with then-popular TV stars of the early 1990s.

30|$|Therefore, {{depending}} {{on the value of}} the f factor, the surface can be either hydrophilic or hydrophobic. According to the above equation, the smaller the value of f, the higher the increase of the contact angle. So it is essential <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> contact area in order to obtain the higher contact angle. For example, the surface hydrophobicity can be improved in the preparation of a nanostructured silicon section. The result is consistent with the reports that black silicon was obtained by a photochemical procedure based on anisotropic etching [25].|$|R
2500|$|During the 1970s, {{a number}} of issues arose which were to have {{significant}} influence on the course of the Society. The first was the tax structure in the UK: for a time, capital gains were taxed at up to 40 per cent (nil on gilts); earned income was taxed in the top bracket at 83 per cent, and investment income in the top bracket at 98 per cent. Lloyd's income counted as earned income, even for Names who did not work at Lloyd's, and this heavily influenced the direction of underwriting: in short, it was desirable for syndicates <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> (<b>small)</b> underwriting loss but a (larger) investment gain. The investment gain was typically achieved by [...] "bond washing" [...] or [...] "gilt stripping": selling the gilt or other bond cum dividend and buying it back ex dividend, thus forfeiting the interest income in exchange for a tax-free capital gain. Syndicate funds were also moved offshore (which later created problems through fraud and self-dealing).|$|E

2500|$|During the Second World War, {{there were}} major {{shortage}} of domestic workforce as {{majority of the}} men were drafted to join the military. Women, who had been primarily relegated to office work or more likely, bound to the home, began to seek employment to supplement their husband's military incomes. [...] This led to a small expansion of their capabilities. [...] The influx of working women into the manufacturing industry to aid the war effort proved invaluable to the Japanese economy. [...] Following World War II, men returned home to start work again, but women were reluctant to return to being housewives. [...] During this postwar state, Japan was in a hurry to gain economic strength to match the west and women were {{a vital part of the}} labor force. [...] Though their roles were still limited, many favoring secretarial work as office ladies, women could work in retail, typically if their family owned stores, they could work as teachers, or in the manufacturing industry. [...] Japanese women did manage <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> stride forward in 1947, with the passing of the Japanese Labor Standards Law. [...] With this in place, working women were given special treatment, restricting their ability to work overtime, on dangerous jobs, on night jobs, and allowing leave during menstruation periods. [...] Though harmful for women seeking equal footing with men in the job world, it protected the majority of early career women who intended to marry. When the recession hit in the mid-70's, the government began to support women workers as a way to bolster the economy. [...] This began the famous M-Curve, which was a graph of the working age of women. [...] Before marriage and after their children were raised proved to be the times women sought out employment, with a dip in between the two for child rearing. [...] This roughly formed an M when charted graphically and the M-curve became the primary reference for working ages of Japanese women to this day. [...] Despite the apparent support of Japanese women's new found independence, part-time pay for Japanese women was only 61% of a man's wages, gradually worsening as the 70's drew on. [...] By the early 80's 45.8% of women aged fifteen and above were in the labor force, the women population of Japan comprising roughly 37.4% of the entire work force. [...] During this time, unmarried women did not make up the majority of the Japanese work force. [...] Women age 36 and above accounted for a much larger percentage. [...] Women who were home bound during this period also used piecework at home as a way of supplementing the family's income. [...] Though the pay for this was incredibly poor, accounting for only a bare bones 25,000 yen per month.|$|E
