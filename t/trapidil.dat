40|$|<b>Trapidil</b> {{inhibits}} human mesangiai cell proliferation: Effect on PDGF β-receptor binding and expression. Mesangiai cell (MC) proliferation, a histopathologic feature {{common to}} many human glomerular diseases, is regulated by several growth factors through their binding to specific cell surface receptors. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a peptide exerting a potent mitogenic activity on MC. Recently, an increased expression of both PDGF protein and its receptor has been localized in the mesangiai areas of several experimental {{as well as}} human proliferative glomerulonephritides (GN). Thus, it may be postulated that the inhibition of PDGF action could prevent MC proliferation during mesangiai proliferative GN. <b>Trapidil,</b> an antiplatelet drug, {{has been shown to}} inhibit the growth of several cell types both in vitro and in vivo. The present study was aimed at evaluating the effect of <b>Trapidil</b> on human MC in vitro. The addition of 100 to 400 µg/ml <b>Trapidil</b> significantly reduced cell proliferation induced by different growth factors (FCS, PDGF-BB, bFGF, EGF), the highest inhibitory effect being on PDGF-BB stimulated MC growth. The effect of the drug was dose-dependent and seemingly specific: aspirin was devoid of any anti-proliferative action, while dypiridamole proved to be toxic. Receptor binding experiments showed that <b>Trapidil</b> competitively inhibited 125 I-PDGF-BB binding to its cell surface receptors, without inducing receptor internalization, at least after short-term (2 hr) incubation. In contrast, long-term (48 hr) exposure to 400 µg/ml <b>Trapidil</b> caused a sharp increase of PDGF-BB binding. Similar effects on cell proliferation and 125 I-PDGF-BB binding were observed when NIH- 3 T 3 fibroblasts were exposed to the test substance. Finally, we evaluated the influence of <b>Trapidil</b> on PDGF β-receptor gene expression and found that 24 hour exposure to 400 µg/ml <b>Trapidil</b> moderately decreased steady-state mRNA levels, whereas 48 hours of incubation increased PDGF β-receptor transcript levels by approximately threefold. We conclude that <b>Trapidil</b> is able to strongly inhibit human MC proliferation, a process in which inhibition of PDGF-BB binding to its receptors and modulation of PDGF β-receptor gene expression might be involved...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the safety and efficacy of <b>trapidil</b> 200 mg in preventing in-stent restenosis. METHODS: Patients with a single native coronary lesion requiring revascularization were randomized to placebo or <b>trapidil</b> at least 1 h before, and continuing for 6 months after, successful implantation of a coronary Wallstent. The primary end-point was in-stent neointimal volume measured by three-dimensional reconstruction of intravascular ultrasound images recorded at the 6 month follow-up catheterization. RESULTS: Of 312 patients randomized at 21 centres in nine countries, 303 (148 <b>trapidil,</b> 155 placebo) underwent successful Wallstent implantation, and 139 patients (90 %) in the placebo group and 130 (88 %) in the <b>trapidil</b> group had repeat catheterization at 26 +/- 2 weeks. There was no significant difference between <b>trapidil</b> and placebo-treated patients regarding in-stent neointimal volume (108. 6 +/- 95. 6 mm(3) vs 93. 3 +/- 79. 1 mm(3);P= 0. 16) or % obstruction volume (38 +/- 18 % vs 36 +/- 21 %;P= 0. 32), in angiographic minimal luminal diameter at follow-up (1. 63 +/- 0. 61 mm vs 1. 74 +/- 0. 69 mm;P= 0. 17), restenosis rate (31 % vs 24 %;P= 0. 24), cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiac events at 7 months (22 % vs 20 %;P= 0. 71) or anginal complaints (30 % vs 24 %;P= 0. 29).

40|$|<b>Trapidil</b> is a triazolopyrimidine {{that has}} been found to prevent {{restenosis}} after vascular injury. Although its precise mode of action is still unclear, several biological effects have been described including inhibition of IFN-γ-induced CD 40 expression on monocytes. Herein, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which <b>Trapidil</b> exerts this inhibitory action. First, we observed that the inhibition of CD 40 expression is associated with the suppression of CD 40 gene transcription, as demonstrated by a clear decrease of CD 40 nuclear RNA (nRNA) levels and unchanged CD 40 mRNA half-life. IFN-γ-induced CD 40 transcription {{has been shown to be}} mediated by STAT 1 α dimers (p 91 /p 84) which, after nuclear translocation, bind to GAS elements present in the promoter of IFN-γ responsive genes. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) with both STAT 1 consensus and CD 40 mGAS probes showed that <b>Trapidil</b> did not affect the DNA binding ability of STAT 1 dimers. STAT 1 dimerization and activation are conferred by upstream phosphorylation of two amino acid residues of the STAT 1 protein. The subsequent studies on these two potential STAT 1 phosphorylation sites (Tyr 701, Ser 727) revealed that <b>Trapidil</b> attenuated IFN-γ-induced Ser 727 but not Tyr 701 phosphorylation. The inhibition of CD 40 transcription by <b>Trapidil</b> could at least partially owing to the impaired Ser 727 phosphorylation of STAT 1, since IFN-γ failed to trigger CD 40 expression in U 3 A S 727 A cells, a cell line displaying a point mutation at the Ser 727 site. Collectively, our results indicate that phosphorylation of STAT 1 at the Ser 727 site enhances CD 40 transcription and that <b>Trapidil</b> might be used as a selective inhibitor that could differentially modulate STAT 1 target genes. © 2004 Elsevier B.

Continuous infusion of PTH into rats results in histological changes similar to parathyroid bone disease, including increased bone formation, focal bone resorption, and severe peritrabecular fibrosis, whereas pulsatile PTH increases bone formation without skeletal abnormalities. Using a cDNA microarray with over 5000 genes, we identified an association between increased platelet-derived growth factor-A (PDGF-A) signaling and PTH-induced bone disease in rats. Verification of PDGF-A overexpression was accomplished with a ribonuclease protection assay. Using immunohistochemistry, PDGF-A peptide was localized to mast cells in PTH-treated rats. We also report a novel strategy for prevention of parathyroid bone disease using triazolopyrimidine (<b>trapidil).</b> <b>Trapidil,</b> an inhibitor of PDGF signaling, {{did not have any}} effect on indexes of bone turnover in normal rats. However, dramatic reductions in marrow fibrosis and bone resorption, but not bone formation, were observed in PTH-treated rats given <b>trapidil.</b> Also, <b>trapidil</b> antagonized the PTH-induced increases in mRNA levels for PDGF-A. These results suggest that PDGF signaling is important for the detrimental skeletal effects of HPT, and drugs that target the cytokine or its receptor might be useful in reducing or preventing parathyroid bone disease...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{activation}} of inflammatory cells {{and the production}} of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Previous studies have demonstrated that the antiplatelet agent <b>trapidil</b> has multiple actions, including suppression of MMP expression through the inhibition of the CD 40 –CD 40 ligand (CD 40 -CD 40 L) pathway in cultured cells. A recent clinical study suggested that <b>trapidil</b> might have functions beyond its antiplatelet action. Methods and resultsIn the present study, we performed immunohistochemical analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the effect of <b>trapidil</b> on the production of MMPs in cultured aortic tissues from patients with infrarenal AAA (n = 9) and control patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease (n = 7). The tissue concentrations of both MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 were significantly higher in AAA walls than in control aortic walls. Both <b>trapidil</b> and an anti-CD 154 (CD 40 L) antibody significantly suppressed the protein production and mRNA expression of MMP- 2 but did not inhibit those of MMP- 9 in organ cultures of AAA wall specimens. MMP- 9 was produced by macrophages and a lot of neutrophils in AAA tissues, whereas MMP- 2 was derived from macrophages. CD 40 was expressed on macrophages but not on neutrophils, and this expression could explain the differential effect of <b>trapidil</b> on the production of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9.

Inspite of a more potent inhibition of the cAMP phosphodiesterase from heart (Bartel et al. 1985) a reversible Ca channel blocking action of both compounds could be observed. The concentration of half maximal block was calculated to about 50 mumol/l for both derivatives tested. Neither a shift in the current-voltage relationships nor a significant change in the potential for half maximal activation was found. The maximal Ba 2 +-conductance was reduced. The steady state inactivation was shifted towards more negative potentials by application of 100 mumol/l AR 12 - 463. The decay of the Ba currents was accelerated in the range of the applied test potentials between - 20 and + 20 mV.

40|$|Background: <b>Trapidil,</b> an {{antianginal}} drug with inhibitory {{effects on}} platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), {{has been shown}} to reduce reactive fibrosis in models of central nervous system injury. Therefore, we evaluated trapidil’s effects on fibroblast activity, Schwann cell proliferation, and PDGF receptor levels in rats after transection and anastomosis of the sciatic nerve. We also evaluated the effect of Schwann cell proliferation on regeneration of anastomosed sciatic nerves. Methods: Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups. Group 1 (N= 10) was used to determine normal peripheral nerve morphology (via light and electron microscopy) and PDGF receptor levels. Group 2 (N= 20) underwent sciatic nerve anastomosis after nerve transection to examine the influence of the surgical procedure on PDGF receptor levels and the microscopic findings. Group 3 (20 rats) received a single intraperitoneal dose of <b>trapidil</b> (40 mg/kg) immediately after the surgical procedure to investigate its effects on fibroblast activity, Schwann cell proliferation, and PDGF levels. Results: PDGF-A and PDGF-B receptor levels were lower in group 3, the trapidil-treated group, than group 2 on all posttransection days examined. Ultrastructural analysis re-vealed that group 3 also had lower levels of fibroblast activity and Schwann cell proliferation than group 2. However, the peripheral nerve ultrastructure and degree of axonal regenera-tion were similar between groups 2 and 3 at 14 days posttransection. Conclusions: <b>Trapidil</b> treatment significantly decreased reactive fibrosis and PDGF receptor expression after peripheral nerve injury, and thus, may be useful therapeutically.

Proliferation indices of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) showed the highest proportion of proliferating cells {{in the media and}} neointima respectively 1 and 5 days after the vascular injury. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy of damaged carotid artery sections as well as immuno-histochemical stainings of von Willebrand factor (vWF) confirmed that reendothelialization was progressive and already complete on day 14, at which time the neointima formation was almost complete. In order to pharmacologically characterize this model further, the effects on neointima formation of <b>trapidil</b> (triazolopyrimidine), a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) antagonist, and captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, were investigated. <b>Trapidil</b> administered orally twice daily at total doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day, started 3 days prior to infliction of injury and up to 7 or 14 days after the catheterization, significantly reduced neointima formation.

To study the relative contribution of these cells and of growth factors released in consequence of activation, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), isolated from the aorta of New Zealand White rabbits, were grown in Dulbecco's medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum (FCS). At 70 % confluence, SMCs were made quiescent by removing FCS from the medium. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were stimulated with activated platelets, neutrophils, lymphocytes+monocytes, whole leukocytes and platelets + whole leukocytes. Then, 1 microCi of O 3 H-thymidine were added to SMC cultures to evaluate the degree of proliferation. Relative contribution of different PLT-derived mediators to SMC growth was evaluated by adding either ketanserin, a 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist, ridogrel, a thromboxane A 2 (TxA 2) receptor antagonist, BN 52021, a platelet activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonist, and <b>trapidil,</b> a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor antagonist, or all antagonists together.

Simultaneous stimulation of SMCs by platelets and whole leukocytes was associated with a significant increase in SMC proliferation as compared to platelets or leukocytes alone. Thus, TxA 2, 5 -HT, PAF, and PDGF all contribute to SMC proliferation in vitro. Adding all antagonist together resulted in an additive antiproliferative effect.

Prior studies implicate platelet-derived growth factor-A (PDGF-A) as an important mediator of selective PTH actions on bone. The present studies used targeted gene profiling and small-molecule antagonists directed against candidate gene products to elucidate the roles of specific PTH-regulated genes and signaling pathways. A group of 29 genes in rats continuously infused with PTH and cotreated with the PDGF receptor antagonist <b>trapidil</b> were differentially expressed compared with PTH treatment alone.

Immunoblot using clone 28, a monoclonal antibody specific for the active form of Src kinases, demonstrated increased active Src expression in the injured rat kidney 6 hours after reperfusion with peak activation at 12 hours.

Cultures were used for evaluation of antiatherogenic drugs. Numerous substances were reported to lower serum atherogenicity: statins, <b>trapidil,</b> calcium antagonists, garlic derivatives etc. On the contrary, betablockers, phenothiazines and oral hypoglycemics were reported to be pro-atherogenic. Known antiatherogenic agents can influence lipid metabolism and cholesterol synthesis, intestinal absorption or endothelium-related mechanisms. All these targets are absent in cell monocultures. Inflammatory factors, addressed by some antiatherogenic drugs, are also not reproduced. In vivo, relationship between cholesterol uptake by cells and atherogenesis must be inverse rather than direct: in familial hypercholesterolemia, inefficient clearance of LDL-cholesterol by cells predisposes to atherosclerosis. Accordingly, if a pharmacological agent reduces cholesterol uptake by cells in vitro, it {{should be expected to}} elevate cholesterol in vivo. Validity of clinical recommendations, based on serum atherogenicity testing in cell monocultures, is therefore questionable. These considerations pertain also to the drugs developed {{on the basis of the}} cell culture experiments...|$|E
40|$|Various {{polypeptide}} {{growth factors}} are {{generally considered to}} be involved in the regulation of the nephrogenic process both after acute renal injury and during renal development. Because platelet-derived growth factor B-chain (PDGF-B) has been reported to be expressed in immature tubulus of the developing kidney, PDGF-B could play a role in the process of tubulogenesis. We examined the expression of PDGF-B and PDGF receptors α and β and their localization in kidneys after ischemia/reperfusion injury. The mRNA expressions of PDGF-B, PDGFR-α, and PDGFR-β were enhanced after injury. In the immunohistochemical analysis and/or in situ hybridization, PDGF-B and PDGFR-α, β were expressed after reperfusion in the S 3 segment of the proximal tubuli, where they were not expressed normally. The expressions of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and vimentin were concomitantly observed with PDGF-B and PDGFRs in the tubular cells of injured S 3 segment at 48 hours after injury. Next, the inhibition of the PDGF-B/PDGFRs axis with either <b>Trapidil</b> or Ki 6896, which was found to inhibit the phosphorylation of PDGFR-β selectively, resulted in a rise of serum creatinine, higher mortality rate, abnormal regenerating process, and suppressed proliferation of tubular epithelial cells. These findings suggest that the PDGF-B/PDGFRs axis is involved in the proliferation of injured tubular cells and plays an important role in the regeneration of tubular cells from acute ischemic injury...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Drug-eluting stents (DES) {{have been}} {{designed}} to prevent restenosis, but long-term clinical outcome may be offset by an increased risk of stent thrombosis, which is associated with suboptimal stent implantation or delayed re-endothelialization. DES implantation has also been associated with local persistent endothelial dysfunction. Conversely, <b>Trapidil</b> is a potent anti-inflammatory, vasodilatator and antiproliferative drug and several studies have shown anti-restenotic effects, suggesting substantial clinical benefits through the use of Trapidil-eluting DES. STUDY DESIGN: This is a longitudinal, single-blind, double-arm, randomized multicenter study. Forty patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes who present at the index procedure with multivessel coronary disease in the major epicardial coronary arteries will be enrolled. Patients should present a culprit lesion with stenosis 70 % or more associated with another stenosis 70 % or more in another coronary artery. Patients will be randomized in a 1 : 1 fashion to receive either an Intrepide trapidil-eluting stent or a Taxus paclitaxel-eluting stent on the culprit lesion. After 90 days, the nonculprit lesion will be treated with the stent of the opposite randomization arm and optical coherence tomography (OCT) analysis of the index stented segment will be performed. Follow-up angiography, combined with vasomotor analysis of endothelial function by rapid atrial pacing, will be done at 12 months after the index procedure on both stents. To further characterize the status of the endothelium, serum measurement of vascular endothelial growth factor gradient between the aorta and 15 mm distal to the implanted stent will be performed at 12 months. The primary endpoint of the study is to compare stent struts re-endothelialization at 90 days by OCT. The secondary endpoint is to compare angiographic outcome and coronary endothelial function 12 months after the index procedure and to compare clinical outcome at 1 and 2 years between trapidil-eluting DES versus paclitaxel-eluting DES. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that the utilization of trapidil-eluting DES in the setting of acute coronary syndromes will be characterized by a greater early re-endothelialization associated with an antiproliferative effect offering a similar efficacy with a better safety profile compared with first-generation DE...|$|E
40|$|Background Pregnancy {{complications}} such as pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, {{intrauterine growth}} restriction and placental abruption {{are thought to have}} a common origin related to abnormalities in the development and function of the placenta. Objectives To compare, using the best available evidence, the benefits and harms of antenatal antithrombotic therapy to improve maternal or infant health outcomes in women considered at risk of placental dysfunction, when compared with other treatments, placebo or no treatment. Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (March 2010). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing antenatal antithrombotic therapy (either alone or in combination with other agents) with placebo or no treatment, or any other treatment in the antenatal period to improve maternal or infant health outcomes in women considered at risk of placental dysfunction. Data collection and analysis Two review authors evaluated trials under consideration for appropriateness for inclusion and methodological quality without consideration of their results according to the prestated eligibility criteria. We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining study data if the trials were judged to be sufficiently similar. We investigated heterogeneity by calculating I² statistic, and if this indicated a high level of heterogeneity among the trials included we used a random-effects model. Main results Our search strategy identified 14 reports of 10 studies for consideration, of which five met the inclusion criteria, involving 484 women. Four studies compared heparin (alone or in combination with dipyridamole) with no treatment; and one compared <b>trapidil</b> (triazolopyrimidine). While there were no statistically significant differences identified for the primary outcomes following heparin treatment, it was associated with a reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and infant birthweight less than the 10 th centile for gestational age. Authors' conclusions The review identified no significant differences for the primary outcomes perinatal mortality, preterm birth less than 34 weeks' gestation, and childhood neurodevelopmental handicap, although the number of studies and participants was small. While treatment with heparin appears promising with a reduction in pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and infant birthweight less than the 10 th centile for gestational age, the number of studies and participants included was small, and to date important information about serious adverse infant and long-term childhood outcomes is unavailable. Further research is required. Jodie M Dodd, Anne McLeod, Rory C Windrim and John Kingdo...|$|E

OBJECTIVES To compare, using the best available evidence, the benefits and harms of antenatal antithrombotic therapy to improve maternal or infant health outcomes in women considered at risk of placental dysfunction, when compared with other treatments, placebo or no treatment. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (17 July 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials comparing antenatal antithrombotic therapy (either alone or in combination with other agents) with placebo or no treatment, or any other treatment in the antenatal period to improve maternal or infant health outcomes in women considered at risk of placental dysfunction. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors evaluated trials under consideration for appropriateness for inclusion and methodological quality without consideration of their results according to the prestated eligibility criteria. We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining study data if the trials were judged to be sufficiently similar. We investigated heterogeneity by calculating I² statistic, and if this indicated a high level of heterogeneity among the trials included, we used a random-effects model. MAIN RESULTS Our search strategy identified 18 reports of 14 studies for consideration. The original review included five studies (484 women) which met the inclusion criteria, with a further five studies included in the updated review, involving an additional 655 women. The overall quality of the included trials was considered fair to good. Nine studies compared heparin (alone or in combination with dipyridamole or low-dose aspirin) with no treatment; and one compared <b>trapidil</b> (triazolopyrimidine). While this review identified the use of heparin to be associated with a statistically significant reduction in risk of perinatal mortality (six studies; 653 women; risk ratio (RR) 0. 40; 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 0. 20 to 0. 78), preterm birth before 34 (three studies; 494 women; RR 0. 46; 95 % CI 0. 29 to 0. 73) and 37 (five studies; 621 women; RR 0. 72; 95 % CI 0. 58 to 0. 90) weeks' gestation, and infant birthweight below the 10 th centile for gestational age (seven studies; 710 infants; RR 0. 41; 95 % CI 0. 27 to 0. 61), {{there is a lack of}} reliable information available related to clinically relevant, serious adverse infant health outcomes, which have not been reported to date. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS While treatment with heparin for women considered to be at particularly high risk of adverse pregnancy complications secondary to placental insufficiency was associated with a statistically significant reduction in risk of perinatal mortality, preterm birth before 34 and 37 weeks' gestation, and infant birthweight below the 10 th centile for gestational age when compared with no treatment for women considered at increased risk of placental dysfunction, to date, important information about serious adverse infant and long-term childhood outcomes is unavailable.
