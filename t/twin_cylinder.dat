25|$|Back mount is {{the system}} where one or more {{cylinders}} are firmly attached to a harness, usually with a buoyancy compensator jacket or wing, and carried on the diver's back. Back mount allows cylinders to be manifolded together as twins, or for special circumstances, trips or quads. It is a high profile arrangement and may be unsuited to some sites where the diver needs to pass through low openings. This is the standard configuration for single or <b>twin</b> <b>cylinder</b> recreational diving, and for much technical diving in open water.|$|E
500|$|The pump at Westonzoyland {{originally}} comprised a beam {{engine and}} scoop wheel, {{which is similar}} to a water wheel, except that it is driven round by the engine and lifts water up to a higher level. After 25years, there were problems pumping the water away as the land surface had dropped as it dried out. A better method was sought, and in 1861 a replacement pump was installed. The engine was built by Easton and Amos of London, to a design patented in 1858 by Charles Amos. It is a <b>twin</b> <b>cylinder,</b> vertical condensing engine, driving a centrifugal pump. A similar engine was on display at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and was shown to be able to lift 100tons of water per minute (1,700 L/s), to a height of [...] The Westonzoyland pump lifts water from the rhyne (pronounced [...] "reen") into the River Parrett. The pump operated until 1951, when a new diesel-powered pumping station, capable of pumping 35tons per minute (600 L/s) at any state of the tide, was built beside the old one. The pumping station is now an Industrial Heritage museum of steam powered machinery and land drainage, and houses most of the equipment from the disused Burrowbridge pumping station.|$|E
