This study aimed {{to determine the best}} ECG electrodes positioning method and the most reliable calculation of mean cardiac axis (MEA) in equines. We evaluated the electrocardiographic profile of 53 clinically healthy Thoroughbreds, 38 males and 15 females, with ages ranging 2 - 7 years old, all reared at the São Paulo Jockey Club, in Brazil. Two ECG tracings were recorded from each animal, one using the Dubois lead positioning system, the second using the base-apex method. QRS complex amplitudes were analyzed to obtain MEA values in the frontal plane for each of the two electrode positioning methods mentioned above, using two calculation approaches, the first by Tilley tables and the second by <b>trigonometric</b> <b>calculation.</b> Results were compared between the two methods. There was significant difference in cardiac axis values: MEA obtained by the Tilley tables was + 135. 1 ° ± 90. 9 ° vs. - 81. 1 ° ± 3. 6 ° (p< 0. 0001), and by <b>trigonometric</b> <b>calculation</b> it was - 15. 0 ° ± 11. 3 ° vs. - 79. 9 ° ± 7. 4 ° (p< 0. 0001), base-apex and Dubois, respectively. Furthermore, Dubois method presented small range of variation without statistical or clinical difference by either calculation mode, while there was a wide variation in the base-apex method.

In the Malay World, the use of the sine quadrant or also referred to as Rubuc Mujayyab is more significant compared to astrolabe. The sine quadrant is a quadrant-shaped plate, which contains grid lines of the scale of trigonometric functions, by which readings and solving trigonometric equations can be done. This equipment {{can also be used to}} measure the altitude of celestial and other landscape objects. Hence, the sine quadrant functions as a mathematical tool that can solve trigonometric calculations. The research presented in this paper relates to the influence of the use of mathematical tools of Islamic civilization in the Malay World, with special emphasis on mathematical calculations using the sine quadrant. With references to a number of manuscripts and printed material relating to pre modern astronomy, this study found that the steps in solving <b>trigonometric</b> <b>calculation</b> in astronomy are explained descriptively using the sine quadrant. The operations in this descriptive form are then matched with basic trigonometry in mathematics.

40|$|PURPOSE AND METHODS: In {{order to}} {{determine}} forces acting upon an articular joint during hand rehabilitation, a dynamic splint was built and connected to a dynamometer (capable of measuring forces in the range 0 - 600 gf). Through <b>trigonometric</b> <b>calculation,</b> the authors measured the flexing force in the proximal interphalangeal joint of the middle finger at 30 °, 45 °, 60 °, and 90 ° of flexion. Measurements were obtained in a population of 40 voluntary adults, 20 females and 20 males, This flexing force was correlated with age, sex, and anthropometric measures. RESULTS: Force in the flexing tendon is maximal {{at the start of}} flexion, and decreases as the angle of joint flexion increases. A relationship was observed between finger length and the magnitude of the force exerted on the tendon: the longer the finger, the greater the force exherted upon the tendon. Force is greater at all the measured angles, (except 30 °) in males and in individuals of higher stature, and bigger arm span. CONCLUSIONS: The flexing force can be effectively measured at all flexing angles, that it correlates with a number of different anthropometric parameters, and that such data are likely to open the way for future studies...|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} a review of planar scissor {{structural}} mechanisms (SSMs) and reports on {{how they can be}} easily transformed from a stowed to a deployed configuration. These mechanisms have an important transformation capacity of their extension and rotation properties, and many examples have been proposed that vary in size, type and geometry. Although there are many studies dealing with designing new planar or spatial SSMs and their calculation methods, there is no systematic study demonstrating the basic typologies, geometric principles, design rules and constraints of such SSMs. Further, current calculation methods are based on the inductive approach in which the dimension of one scissor unit (SU) is given, but the span of the whole structure is found later according to the number of SUs that are used to assemble the structure. However, this approach is not convenient for architectural applications, because it requires a deductive approach in which the dimensions and required number of SUs are calculated according to defined span length. On the basis of this concept, this article, first, analyses the geometric design of SSMs systematically in terms of their possible configurations and then develops <b>trigonometric</b> <b>calculation</b> methods for different types of SSMs, using a deductive approach...|$|E
