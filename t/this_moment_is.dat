The magnitude of <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> proportional to the moment of inertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the front wheel by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|E

25|$|The {{penitent}} is {{the subject}} rather than the object of this discourse. Contrition {{is not something that}} happens to the penitent but is rather an affect he or she creates, as the focus on humility and on the weeping voice suggests. Affectivity is the translation of idea into expressive gesture, and <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> surely an affective one. If the genuineness of a late-medieval spiritual experience is confirmed by its external signs—by its affectivity, in other words—we should extend the same criterion to the early evidence, where we find that it works just as well.|$|E

25|$|Extinction is {{the process}} by which a group of taxa or species dies out, {{reducing}} biodiversity. The moment of extinction is generally considered the death of the last individual of that species. Because a species' potential range may be very large, determining <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> difficult, and is usually done retrospectively after a period of apparent absence. Species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing habitat or against superior competition. In Earth's history, over 99% of all the species that have ever lived are extinct; however, mass extinctions may have accelerated evolution by providing opportunities for new groups of organisms to diversify.|$|E
25|$|The central concept {{around which}} this play is built is {{the dilemma of}} what to do with Harry and Edna. Their {{situation}} is the focal point for all the characters, including Harry and Edna themselves. Albee uses this dilemma to cause emotions to rise. As his characters try to figure out what to do about the Harry and Edna, they have a series of discussions or debates that slowly rise in emotional temperature. Each character has his or her definition of what the dilemma is, as well as a means for resolving it. The tension in the play rises with the rise of emotions as the characters move toward a climax or a moment of truth. <b>This</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> played out most specifically by Tobias and Harry in the conversation that defines their friendship: one that is built on rights and responsibilities rather than love and affection. In the end, Harry and Edna decide to go back home, thus solving, or at least releasing some of the tension of the dilemma.|$|E
25|$|Pratt is {{most famous}} for his run out of Australian captain Ricky Ponting at Trent Bridge in the 2005 Ashes series. Brought on to field as a substitute, Pratt was fielding at cover when Damien Martyn tapped the ball in his {{direction}} and attempted a quick single. Pratt duly threw down the stumps at the striker's end with Ponting considerably short of his ground. <b>This</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> remembered {{as one of the}} most important turning points during the series, with Ponting looking well set for a big score at the time. The dismissal prompted an angry outburst from the batsman, who was seen shouting up at the England balcony towards Duncan Fletcher, unhappy at England's frequent use of substitute fielders during the series. Ironically, although England may have used substitute fielders to rest bowlers between spells, this appearance by Pratt was not among them: he was replacing Simon Jones, who had been taken to hospital with an ankle injury. The run out earned him a place on the open top bus parade following the series victory.|$|E

500|$|During {{the early}} hours of the event, [...] the Foreign Minister of Ivory Coast (the host country of ECOWAS) Daniel Kablan Duncan said that the [...] "information {{indicates}} to us that there is a coup underway. ECOWAS formally and rigorously condemns such an attempted coup d'etat," [...] he added that [...] "it's sad that after the example of Senegal, where the elections finished so well, that we have, after Mali, a new forceful intervention in Guinea-Bissau. What I can say at <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> that...the situation won't be accepted by ECOWAS." [...] ECOWAS Commission President Kadré Désiré Ouedraogo issued a statement that read: [...] "The commission firmly denounces this latest incursion by the military into politics and unreservedly condemns the irresponsible act, which has once more demonstrated their penchant to maintain Guinea-Bissau as a failed state." [...] ECOWAS later decided to send a contingent of military personnel in order to provide security. The delegation, which would also include civilians, would be led by Guinean President Alpha Condé. ECOWAS also said the election runoff should go ahead. ECOWAS constitutes a contact group, chaired by Nigeria and comprising delegations from Benin, Cape Verde, Gambia, Guinea, Senegal and Togo, to coordinate its efforts at resolving the crisis. ECOWAS also had a stanby force to fill a vacuum that could be left by the departing MISSANG force, as well as considering International Criminal Court recommendations.|$|E

2500|$|In {{biology and}} ecology, {{extinction}} {{is the end}} of an organism or of a group of organisms (taxon), normally a species. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of the species, although the capacity to breed and recover may have been lost before this point. Because a species' potential range may be very large, determining <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as Lazarus taxa, where a species presumed extinct abruptly [...] "reappears" [...] (typically in the fossil record) after a period of apparent absence.|$|E

2500|$|With a {{capacity}} of 8,500, the Field House was packed. The home crowd waved U.S. flags and sang patriotic songs such as [...] "God Bless America". Before the game, Brooks read his players a statement he had written out {{on a piece of}} paper, telling them that [...] "You were born to be a player. You were meant to be here. <b>This</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> yours." [...] Brooks believed they could win and later said, [...] "The Russians were ready to cut their own throats. But we had {{to get to the point}} to be ready to pick up the knife and hand it to them. So the morning of the game I called the team together and told them, 'It's meant to be.

2500|$|... "An {{immobile}} hider {{is located}} on the real line according to a known probability distribution. A searcher, whose maximal velocity is one, starts from the origin and wishes to discover the hider in minimal expected time. It is assumed that the searcher can change the direction of his motion without any loss of time. It is also assumed that the searcher cannot see the hider until he actually reaches {{the point at which the}} hider is located and the time elapsed until <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> the duration of the game." [...] It is obvious that in order to find the hider the searcher has to go a distance x1 in one direction, return to the origin and go distance x2 in the other direction etc., (the length of the n-th step being denoted by xn), and to do it in an optimal way. (However, an optimal solution need not have a first step and could start with an infinite number of small 'oscillations'.) This problem is usually called the linear search problem and a search plan is called a trajectory. It has attracted much research, some of it quite recent.|$|E
2500|$|The anatta {{doctrine}} {{is not a}} kind of materialism. Buddhism does not deny the existence of [...] "immaterial" [...] entities, and it (at least traditionally) distinguishes bodily states from mental states. Thus, the conventional translation of anatta as [...] "no-soul" [...] can be confusing. If the word [...] "soul" [...] simply refers to an incorporeal component in living things that can continue after death, then Buddhism does not deny {{the existence of the}} soul. Instead, Buddhism denies the existence of a permanent entity that remains constant behind the changing corporeal and incorporeal components of a living being. Just as the body changes from moment to moment, so thoughts come and go, and there is no permanent state underlying the mind that experiences these thoughts, as in Cartesianism. Conscious mental states simply arise and perish with no [...] "thinker" [...] behind them. When the body dies, Buddhists believe the incorporeal mental processes continue and are reborn in a new body. Because the mental processes are constantly changing, the being that is reborn is neither entirely different from, nor exactly the same as, the being that died. However, the new being is continuous with the being that died – {{in the same way that}} the [...] "you" [...] of <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> continuous with the [...] "you" [...] of a moment before, despite the fact that you are constantly changing.|$|E

2500|$|On 11 July, Tschirschky {{reported}} to Jagow that he [...] "again took {{the occasion to}} discuss with Berchtold what action was to be taken against Serbia, chiefly in order to assure the minister once again, emphatically that speedy action was called for". On the same day, the German Foreign Office {{wanted to know if}} they should send a telegram congratulating King Peter of Serbia on his birthday. Wilhelm replied: [...] "As Vienna has so far inaugurated no action of any sort against Belgrade, the omission of the customary telegram would be too noticeable and might be the cause of premature uneasiness... It should be sent." [...] On 12 July, Szögyény reported from Berlin that everyone in the German government wanted to see Austria-Hungary declare war on Serbia at once, and were tired of Austrian indecision about whether to choose war or peace. He added that this:"absolute insistence on a war against Serbia was based on the two considerations already mentioned; firstly that Russia and France were 'not yet ready' and secondly that Britain will not at this juncture intervene in a war which breaks out over a Balkan state, even if this should lead to a conflict with Russia, possibly also France... Not only have Anglo-German relations so improved that Germany feels that she need no longer feel fear a directly hostile attitude by Britain, but above all, Britain at <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> anything but anxious for war, and has no wish whatever to pull chestnuts out of the fire for Serbia, or in the last instance, Russia...
