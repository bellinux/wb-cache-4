500|$|In his {{biography}} of Ranjitsinhji, Simon Wilde suggests that MacLaren had <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> for his employer in this period, and found {{little time for}} cricket. In addition, his batting form was poor throughout, {{and he seemed to}} be in bad physical condition when he occasionally found time to play. Before Ranjitsinhji returned to India, MacLaren resigned as his secretary—although he went with him to India for a holiday. According to Wilde, the resignation was to allow MacLaren to play more regularly, but [...] "he never really recovered his form". In summarising Ranjitsinhji's life at this time, Wilde suggests that his unreliability with money was quite calculated, and writes: [...] "Many of his off-the-field exploits with A. C. MacLaren... will probably never be known, but it seems clear that sometimes they were not averse to conducting themselves in the fashion of E. W. Hornung's fictional character Raffles, the cricketing burglar." ...|$|E

It could easily have gone over-board. I wanted to avoid making the character caricatural [...] Barring one portion ... we kept it controlled." [...] Bachchan and Abraham, who had gained weight for their earlier films, had to lose the weight and become more muscular. Although Chopra agreed to wear a swimsuit, she refused to wear a bikini. The actress said that {{that she did not}} lose any weight (as the media speculated), but worked out for a toned look in her films; she was also filming Fashion (2008) at the time. According to Chopra, [...] "For Fashion, I had to put on six kilos and later had to shed chip by chip as the character progressed in the film. My body structure in Dostana is more toned than in Fashion as it is a completely beach film. I've worked very hard on my body." ...|$|E

A {{relationship}} develops, and despite her initial trepidation, Pauline remarries in 2006, after almost a decade alone. Pauline's marriage to Joe {{was an attempt to}} give the character a [...] "new lease of life", and her wedding day was screened to coincide with EastEnders 21st anniversary. Richard was openly opposed to her character remarrying, but she was eventually convinced by the executive producer and battled, successfully, for Pauline to keep the [...] "Fowler" [...] surname. However, in July 2006, Wendy Richard announced that she was leaving EastEnders; she quit due to [...] "creative differences" [...] with the show's producers regarding Pauline's remarriage, which she felt was [...] "disloyal" [...] to her character's beloved first husband, Arthur. According to an interview in The Sun, Richard commented, [...] "I think it's the most terrible shame, I really do. I thought in my heart of hearts it was wrong... I just couldn't believe that Pauline would remarry—anybody... I would have stayed a bit longer if Pauline hadn't got married." [...] Richard felt that she did not have the same chemistry with Ray Brooks, who played Joe, as she did with Bill Treacher, who played Arthur. She refuted producers' opinions that Pauline and Joe [...] "looked good together" [...] and felt that she and Brooks had <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to turn them into a [...] "realistic-looking couple." ...|$|E

[...] Bloomberg pointed out at that countries such as Brazil, South Korea and Thailand sold their respective currencies in the weeks preceding the report to curb gains and support export.

Ewbank expected to coach quarterbacks, having played the position in college, but Brown insisted that he oversee the tackles.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to get a better {{understanding}} of internal marketing motivation and challenges faced by employees of rural banks in Eastern Region of Ghana. The sample size for the study was 350 employees and was selected using convenience sampling technique. Questionnaire was the main instrument used for data collection. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics based on frequencies and percentages. Results of the study showed that money was not the only incentive that motivated employees of rural banks <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>very</b> <b>harder.</b> The results also showed that employees of the rural banks lacked the logistics to enable them perform effectively. Furthermore, the study revealed that employees of rural banks have not been accorded the recognition they deserved by management. Moreover, the study indicated that sales target set for employees were very difficult to achieve. Hence, for employees to achieve sales target set, performance of staff must fully reflect rewards given to them to serve as a motivational tool. Also, management should provide the needed logistics and put in place a comprehensive plan for training and development of all staff to equip them with the necessary skills to perform effectively...|$|R

2500|$|In later years, Spurrier {{has stated}} that his seasons working to get maximum {{production}} out of outmanned Duke squads were critical to his development as a coach and an offensive strategist. Success at a school not known for its football program also built Spurrier's reputation as an innovative young offensive coach who could improvise and succeed without seeming <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard.</b> Duke quarterback Ben Bennett recalls Spurrier diagraming a trick halfback option play with his cereal on the morning before a game, and the play going for a 60-yard touchdown pass that afternoon.

I <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> at the task I had assigned to myself, and did, I think, see much of the manners and institutions of the people. Nothing struck me more than their persistence in the ordinary pursuits of life in spite of the war which was around them. Neither industry nor amusement seemed to meet with any check. Schools, hospitals, and institutes were by no means neglected because new regiments were daily required. The truth, I take it, is that we, all of us, soon adapt ourselves to the circumstances around us. Though three parts of London were in flames I should no doubt expect to have my dinner served to me if I lived in the quarter which was free from fire.|$|R
