He hired cartoonist Matt Groening to create a series of shorts for the show, which eventually led to The Simpsons in 1989. The Simpsons won numerous awards and is still running. Brooks also co-produced and co-wrote the 2007 film adaptation of the show, The Simpsons Movie. In total, Brooks has received 47 Emmy nominations, winning 20 of them.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Yankovic {{starred in}} a {{full-length}} feature film, co-written {{by himself and}} manager Jay Levey, and filmed in Tulsa, Oklahoma called UHF. A satire of <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>and</b> film industries, also starring Michael Richards, Fran Drescher, and Victoria Jackson, it brought floundering studio Orion their highest test scores since the movie RoboCop. Although the movie made a little over six million domestically – out of a budget of five million – it was considered unsuccessful.|$|E

The News-Miner offices and printing facilities on the lower floors were spared from the flames, but suffered water damage. Due to winter temperatures, the water soon froze.

40|$|This {{introductory}} article {{argues that}} {{the current state of}} debate on television within cultural studies is marked by considerable areas of theoretical and political uncertainty. The spread of deregulatory and privatizing public policies in relation to <b>television,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> disarticulation of <b>television</b> from <b>the</b> idea of the national community and from the role of the citizen, have posed new problems for theorizing <b>the</b> relation between <b>television</b> <b>and</b> its audiences. In this article I survey a number of key areas of debate: <b>the</b> relation between <b>television,</b> <b>the</b> nation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> state; <b>television</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> citizen/consumer, <b>television</b> content <b>and</b> performance, and the likely future(s) of television...|$|R

5|$|Film of {{the concert}} was {{produced}} for television broadcast and the home video market.

5|$|Holby City has {{attracted}} comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>and</b> entertainment industry including Broadcasting Standards Commission director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of squandering the {{television licence fee}} on the programme. The series employs {{a team of researchers}} to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. Holby City has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the British Medical Association denouncing its portrayal of organ donation and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and an accident and emergency nurse at the 2008 Royal College of Nursing conference accusing the show of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.|$|E

The creatures leave as the military arrives. Samantha and Andrew kiss before they are rushed into different vehicles.
