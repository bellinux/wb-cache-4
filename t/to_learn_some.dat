While staying at Sacred Heart, Bok began <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> English and made important contacts among the Dinka population of Cairo. He also began practicing his Christian faith without fear of reprisal. He eventually moved out of the church compound and into an apartment with other Dinka who were also seeking UN refugee status in order to leave Africa for the United States, Great Britain or Australia.|$|E
25|$|I owe {{so much to}} Brett, and teamTBB. It was Brett that {{advised me}} to turn pro, {{he told me to}} do an Ironman and he trained me to win two World Ironman Championships. Not only that, the Team {{framework}} enabled me to train with some of the best athletes in the world; to grow and develop as a person and <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> incredibly important lessons. With the Team I reached heights that I never thought possible, and for that I am truly grateful. teamTBB is focused on helping 'development athletes' who might otherwise not have the opportunity to succeed in professional triathlon. I no longer fit into their framework, and hence {{the time has come for}} me to move on.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} case {{reported}} {{is that of}} patient Henry Molaison, known as H.M., in March 1953. Molaison's chief complaint was the persistence of severe seizures and therefore had a bilateral lobectomy (both of his MTLs were removed). As a result, Molaison had bilateral damage to both the hippocampal formation and the perirhinal cortex. Molaison had average intelligence and perceptual ability and a decent vocabulary. However, he could not learn new words or remember things that had happened {{more than a few}} minutes earlier. He could remember anything from his childhood. If the memory was created from before his lobectomy, he still had the ability to retrieve it and remember. However, he was able <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> new skills. He was the first well-documented case of severe anterograde amnesia, and was studied until his death in 2008.|$|E

25|$|Based {{on these}} results the {{concluded}} that Genie's brain had completed lateralization and that, because Genie had received no stimulation in her language center {{when she was}} a child, it had atrophied and her language functions had instead lateralized to her right hemisphere. Her results on their non-language tests suggested to them that her hemispheric dominance was not simply reversed. They believed that Genie had been developing as a normal right-handed person until the time her father began isolating her, and attributed the extreme imbalance between Genie's left and right hemispheres to the fact that Genie's sensory stimulation as a child was almost exclusively visual and tactile. Previous observations of right-hemisphere language acquisition in adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients consistently showed that both populations were much better at learning vocabulary, although they were able <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> basic grammar. Linguists noted these subjects had an advantage over Genie because, unlike her, their right hemispheres had already acquired at least a small amount of basic language.|$|E

500|$|The year 1968 {{marked the}} start of what Dylan himself later termed his [...] "amnesia", {{referring}} {{to a form of}} writer's block he experienced post-John Wesley Harding (1967), when painting had replaced songwriting as his preferred creative outlet. Well known for his unsophisticated musical approach, particularly in comparison to Harrison's broader [...] "harmonic palette", author Simon Leng suggests, Dylan was now eager <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> more-advanced chords. Harrison began demonstrating various major seventh, diminished and augmented chord shapes – [...] "all these funny chords people showed me when I was a kid", as he later put it. While playing a G major 7 chord and taking the shape up the guitar neck to B major 7, Harrison realised, [...] "Ah, this sounds like a tune here..."

500|$|After a {{visit to}} Birmingham, Bache moved to Rome in 1863 and lived there the next two years. While there he {{received}} private lessons from Liszt, {{one of the few}} pupils thus privileged; most of Liszt's students attended only his master classes. He also heard Liszt play his own music on many occasions in private homes, including a then-rare performance of the Piano Sonata in B minor. Liszt helped him prepare for several public concerts in Rome and encouraged him <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> difficult pieces that Bache initially felt unable to play; these pieces included Liszt's transcriptions of Gounod's Faust Waltz and Meyerbeer's [...] "Patineurs" [...] Waltz from his opera Le prophète. These lessons, the kindness that Liszt continually showed, and Bache's exposure to Liszt in general, became a life-defining experience. Liszt expected him to work hard and Bache applied himself with a purpose to his keyboard studies. The same [...] "musician of high standing" [...] that Constance quotes about Bache's years in Leipzig also states that [...] "there {{can be no doubt that}} it was his friendship with Liszt that he owed that enthusiasm and power of sustained hard work which distinguished him during his career in London, and which was often the astonishment of those who had known him in earlier years." ...|$|E
500|$|Gameplay drew {{a variety}} of {{reactions}} from [...] "immersive" [...] and [...] "intriguing", to formulaic. The puzzles were generally considered by critics as challenging and well-done. The duration of the game was considered short, and reviewers criticized the spacing of the save points and absence of checkpoints. The game's adherence to the formula of the Silent Hill series also drew criticism; the opening comment of GameSpot's review remarked that [...] "this old fog needs <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> new tricks", and further detailed that the game provided [...] "an entirely conventional adventure that relies on eight-year-old franchise hallmarks {{at the expense of}} anything truly new." [...] Some camera issues were noted, especially in tight corridors. Reviewers wrote that Origins had a greater emphasis on combat than previous installments, although reaction to the combat was generally negative. Some reviewers felt that the player was encouraged to avoid combat, due to {{a variety of}} gameplay factors, including the breakable melee weapons. On the other hand, GameSpy's David Chapman stated that the readily available weapons made Travis too powerful. The inclusion of quick time events was not well received by reviewers, who felt that it added nothing appealing to the game. Additionally, the soundtrack was frequently praised as frightening, and a part of the game's appeal. The PlayStation Official Magazine UK wrote: [...] "Despite its small-screen setting, Origins even manages a few genuine scares, mostly thanks to the first-rate sound: this should only be played through headphones." ...|$|E
500|$|Westley was {{appointed}} manager of League Two bottom side Newport County on 7 October 2016, following the sacking of Warren Feeney. Despite Westley criticising his players with some [...] "harsh words", {{saying he was}} [...] "not prepared to tolerate that sort of rubbish anymore", Newport went on to lose eight successive games, which Westley described as [...] "embarrassing" [...] and [...] "humiliating". Club secretary Graham Bean resigned in December, saying [...] "Graham Westley is an impossible man to work with... he needs <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> manners and start treating people with some respect". Shortly afterwards Westley again courted controversy after refusing to leave opposition manager Derek Adams's press conference. He signed 14 players in the January transfer window, a move he admitted was a [...] "short-term risk". However he failed to arrest the team's declining fortunes and was sacked on 9 March 2017 with Newport 11 points adrift {{at the bottom of}} League Two. The club's board said that they had consulted both fans and the players over their decision to sack Westley; he had been confronted by irate supporters at Rodney Parade and after his sacking transfer-listed midfielder Mark Randall came out to say he had been [...] "treated quite unfairly" [...] by Westley. Caretaker-manager Michael Flynn managed to organise an unlikely escape from relegation for the [...] "Exiles" [...] after overseeing seven victories in the remaining 12 games of the 2016–17 season.|$|E

2500|$|The syncopated, but {{straight}} subdivision feel of Cuban music (as {{opposed to}} swung subdivisions) took root in New Orleans R during this time. Stewart states: [...] "Eventually, musicians {{from outside of}} New Orleans began <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> of the rhythmic practices [...] Most important of these were James Brown and the drummers and arrangers he employed. Brown's early repertoire had used mostly shuffle rhythms, {{and some of his}} most successful songs were 12/8 ballads (e.g. 'Please, Please, Please' (1956), 'Bewildered' (1961), 'I Don't Mind' (1961)). Brown's change to a funkier brand of soul required 4/4 metre and a different style of drumming." [...] Stewart makes the point: [...] "The singular style of rhythm & blues that emerged from New Orleans in the years after World War II {{played an important role in}} the development of funk. In a related development, the underlying rhythms of American popular music underwent a basic, yet generally unacknowledged transition from triplet or shuffle feel to even or straight eighth notes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Language shift [...] "occurs when {{speakers}} {{in a community}} give up speaking their language and take up the use of another in its place". ASL in particular, and sign languages in general, are undeniably influenced by their close contact with English or other oral languages, as evidenced by phenomena such as [...] "loan signs" [...] or lexicalized fingerspelling (the sign language equivalent of loanwords), and through the influence of Contact Sign. However, due to the physical fact of deafness or hearing loss, deaf people generally cannot acquire and speak the majority language {{in the same way}} or with the same competency that the hearing population does. Simultaneously, Deaf people still often have a need or desire <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>some</b> form of English in order to communicate with family members and the majority culture. Thus, Deaf communities and individuals, in contrast to many hearing bilingual communities and individuals, will tend to [...] "remain bilingual throughout their lives and from generation to generation".|$|E

2500|$|Bonobos {{are capable}} of passing the mirror-recognition test for self-awareness, as are all great apes. They {{communicate}} primarily through vocal means, although the meanings of their vocalizations are not currently known. However, most humans do understand their facial expressions {{and some of their}} natural hand gestures, such as their invitation to play. The communication system of wild bonobos includes a characteristic that was earlier only known in humans: bonobos use the same call to mean different things in different situations, and the other bonobos have to take the context into account when determining the meaning. Two bonobos at the Great Ape Trust, Kanzi and Panbanisha, have been taught how to communicate using a keyboard labeled with lexigrams (geometric symbols) and they can respond to spoken sentences. Kanzi's vocabulary consists of more than 500 English words, and he has comprehension of around 3,000 spoken English words. Kanzi is also known for learning by observing people trying to teach his mother; Kanzi started doing the tasks that his mother was taught just by watching, some of which his mother had failed <b>to</b> <b>learn.</b> <b>Some,</b> such as philosopher and bioethicist Peter Singer, argue that these results qualify them for [...] "rights to survival and life"—rights which humans theoretically accord to all persons. (See great ape personhood) Afterwards Kanzi was also taught how to use and create stone tools in 1990. Then, within 3 years, three researchers—Kathy Schick, Nicholas Toth and Gary Garufi—wanted to test Kanzi's knapping skills. Though Kanzi was able to form flake technology, he did not create it the way they expected. Unlike the way hominids did it, where they held the core in one hand and knapped it with the other, Kanzi threw the cobble against a hard surface or against another cobble. This allowed him to produce a larger force to initiate a fracture as opposed to knapping it in his hands.|$|E
