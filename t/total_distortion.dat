40|$|Abstract — Harmonic Elimination in a {{multilevel}} inverters is an {{optimization problem}} which is solved by applying {{particle swarm optimization}} (PSO) technique. The derived equation for the computation of <b>total</b> harmonic <b>distortion</b> (THD) of the output voltage of the multilevel inverter is used as the objective function in PSO algorithm. The objective function used {{is to reduce the}} THD of the multilevel inverter and obtain the corresponding switching angles with the elimination of possible lower order harmonics. In this paper a pseudo code based algorithm is proposed to deal with inequality constraints which will helps in accelerating the optimization process. The proposed method is applied for seven level cascade inverter to eliminate the 5 th and 7 th order harmonics to reduce the <b>total</b> harmonic <b>distortion.</b> This proposed PSO algorithm is effective in reducing the <b>total</b> harmonic <b>distortion</b> corresponding the range of modulation index.
