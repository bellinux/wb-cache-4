5|$|There is a {{relatively}} small variety of coats {{in relation to the}} number of colors and markings, and not all are internationally standardized. The most common type is the normal or standard, which is allowed variance in coarseness between the sexes; males have a coarse, thick, rough coat, while females' coats are softer and finer. Other standardized coats include: rex, in which all the hairs are curly, even the whiskers; velveteen, a softer variation of the rex; satin or silky coat, which is extra-soft and fine, with a sheen; and Harley, characterized by wispy long straight hairs. Remaining coat types are not defined by the hair itself, but rather by <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> such as hairless rats.|$|E
25|$|Positions on the {{existence}} of God can be divided along numerous axes, producing a variety of orthogonal classifications. Theism and atheism are positions of belief (or lack of it), while gnosticism and agnosticism are positions of knowledge (or <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it).</b> Ignosticism concerns belief regarding God's conceptual coherence. Apatheism concerns belief regarding the practical importance of whether God exists.|$|E
25|$|Coren's first widely {{recognized}} book outside of professional psychology circles was 1993's The Left-Hander Syndrome: {{the causes and}} consequences of left-handedness, which presented data on the significant challenges faced by left-handed people in society. His research was discussed widely, and has been printed and discussed {{in a number of}} professional journals such as Psychiatric Times. His next book was Sleep Thieves, the result of his studies into sleep and <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The book examined how the reduction of sleeping time in modern society has created problems of sleep deprivation for many people.|$|E

25|$|Generally speaking, {{the levels}} of service {{available}} will {{fall into one of}} three categories; Basic Life Support (BLS), Advanced Life Support (ALS), and Critical Care Transport (CCT) by traditional healthcare professionals, meaning nurses and/or physicians working in the pre-hospital setting and even on ambulances. In some jurisdictions, a fourth level, Intermediate Life Support (ILS), which is essentially a BLS provider with a moderately expanded skill set, may be present, but this level rarely functions independently, and where it is present may replace BLS in the emergency part of the service. When this occurs, any remaining staff at the BLS level is usually relegated to the non-emergency transportation function. Job titles typically include Emergency Medical Technician, Ambulance Technician, or Paramedic. These ambulance care givers are generally professionals or paraprofessionals and in some countries their use is controlled through training and registration. While these job titles are protected by legislation in some countries, this protection is by no means universal, and anyone might, for example, call themselves an 'EMT' or a 'paramedic', regardless of their training, or <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> In some jurisdictions, both technicians and paramedics may be further defined by the environment in which they operate, including such designations as 'Wilderness', 'Tactical', and so on.|$|E
500|$|Ornstein, burned out, {{effectively}} {{gave up his}} celebrated performance {{career in}} the early 1920s. His [...] "music was soon forgotten", writes scholar Erik Levi, leaving him [...] "an essentially peripheral figure in American musical life." [...] As described by Broyles, [...] "Ornstein had mostly retired {{by the time the}} new music organizations of the 1920s appeared. Too early and too independent, Ornstein had little desire to participate in the modernist movement by the time it caught hold in the United States.... seemed little bothered by the publicity or <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> He listened only to his own voice." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{first two}} songs are a one-two {{introduction}} to the rapper and what he is up to. There is a gloomy interior monologue about success, <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and Cudi's inner conflicts, where he welcomes listeners by saying they are in his dreams. [...] "Soundtrack 2 My Life" [...] is a more courageous theme song where he proclaims, [...] "This is the soundtrack to my life". In it he states that his family {{did not see the}} sadness in him and that he has not been right since his father's death. The third track, {{which is part of the}} second half of the introduction, has an outer-space style, which is due in part to the Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark group sample, and showcases the rapper's readiness to experiment.|$|E

500|$|Connor, {{despite being}} {{the son of}} two [...] "vampires," [...] {{is meant to be}} [...] "human" [...] with {{otherwise}} super powers. Due to this, he wasn’t given the vampire makeup of the series. Kartheiser expresses his simultaneous joy and dismay at this, considering makeup an added benefit for the character and agreeing that <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> saved him much time. Connor was initially clad in clothes made of animal skin, and his attire was said to resemble 'Peter Pan' and 'Robin Hood'. He was also wearing, as a trophy, a necklace made of parts of demons he killed in hell. After he settles in this world, he drops the necklace and is given a more casual set of clothes: jeans, T-shirts, and jackets. The concept behind Connor’s wardrobe was that, unconcerned with this world’s fashion sense, he [...] "just took whatever was available." [...] Yet, one interviewer notices his clothing to be [...] "conservative [...] for somebody who's never seen an advert". Connor's hairstyle at the start was short and choppy as if cut with a knife. Afterward he's given a modern and cleaner look with longer, styled hair. Kartheiser was critical of the new hair style calling it 'David Cassidy hair-do' and feeling it was a 'little bit heavy'.|$|E
500|$|Allan Girdler and Glynn Kerr {{nonetheless}} still {{favor the}} Roper, even by Cameron's criterion. The reason, they say, {{is that it}} did in fact pioneer successful motorcycle technologies, including the twistgrip throttle control, and the frame geometry and engine placement used by the motorcycle {{as we know it}} today, while the Reitwagen was exceedingly crude, failing to employ the well understood principles of rake and trail to remain upright by movements of the front fork, and turn by leaning. Rake and trail are created by having the steering axis angled to varying degrees, rather than perfectly vertical, and by having the steering axis slightly offset, creating trail. This subtle engineering makes it possible for the rider to turn the bicycle or motorcycle by the counterintuitive, and typically unconscious, technique of countersteering, in which the handlebar is turned slightly to the left, causing the machine to lean to the right, and turning the vehicle to the right. Trail, also called fork offset, is an element contributing to the stability of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics, and <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was one reason why the Reitwagen had to rely on two outrigger wheels to keep it from falling down, so it remained vertical and was steered much like a tricycle. David Burgess-Wise called the Daimler-Maybach test bed [...] "a crude makeshift", saying, [...] "as a bicycle, it was 20 years out of date." ...|$|E
500|$|Vonnegut was a vocal {{critic of}} the society in which he lived, and this was {{reflected}} in his writings. Several key social themes recur in Vonnegut's works, such as wealth, <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and its unequal distribution among a society. In The Sirens of Titan, the novel's protagonist, Malachi Constant, is exiled to one of Saturn's moons, Titan, {{as a result of}} his vast wealth, which has made him arrogant and wayward. In God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, readers may find it difficult to determine whether the rich or the poor are in worse circumstances as the lives of both groups' members are ruled by their wealth or their poverty. Further, in Hocus Pocus, the protagonist is named Eugene Debs Hartke, a homage to the famed socialist Eugene V. Debs and Vonnegut's socialist views. In Kurt Vonnegut: A Critical Companion, Thomas F. Marvin states: [...] "Vonnegut points out that, left unchecked, capitalism will erode the democratic foundations of the United States." [...] Marvin suggests that Vonnegut's works demonstrate what happens when a [...] "hereditary aristocracy" [...] develops, where wealth is inherited along familial lines: the ability of poor Americans to overcome their situations is greatly or completely diminished. Vonnegut also often laments social Darwinism, and a [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] view of society. He points out that social Darwinism leads to a society that condemns its poor for their own misfortune, and fails to help them out of their poverty because [...] "they deserve their fate". Vonnegut also confronts the idea of free will in a number of his pieces. In Slaughterhouse-Five and Timequake the characters have no choice in what they do; in Breakfast of Champions, characters are very obviously stripped of their free will and even receive it as a gift; and in Cat's Cradle, Bokononism views free will as heretical.|$|E

2500|$|Some of {{the artistic}} vision White {{developed}} during this time he later applied to his photography.

[...] White's grandson and biographer Maynard Pressley White Jr. noted that among his grandfather's sketches of this time was a drawing of a female nude seated on a large sphere, blowing bubbles from a pipe and surrounded by many floating spheres in the air. This same imagery later appeared repeatedly in White's photography.|$|E

Evoking a curious combination of childlike innocence, Harlequin romance and hippie sentimentality, her songs are tone poems of a sort, inspired by vulnerability and wariness, sung in a small, plaintive, unguarded soprano. At times she seems hopelessly lovesick, a prime candidate for any heartbreaker's ruse, but on [...] "You Did It All Before," [...] "Clock," [...] and [...] "Don't Fade Away" [...] she sounds a lot older and wiser, no stranger to hurt and disillusionment." ...|$|E
