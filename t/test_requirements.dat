5|$|The current youth {{programme}} {{has been}} developed from Baden-Powell's original Scout training scheme, which aimed to encourage personal achievement and {{provide a framework for}} the activities of the Scout Troop. In the Boy Scout section, this consisted of the award of badges for Tenderfoot, Second and First Class Scout and finally King's Scout, which were earned by passing tests {{in a wide variety of}} skills associated with the outdoors, health and good citizenship. With the creation of the Wolf Cub section in 1916, a similar system was devised, the awards being Tenderpad, First Star and Second Star, and an award called the Leaping Wolf was added later which required Cubs to move up to the Scout Troop. In parallel with this scheme, Cubs and Scouts were able to earn Proficiency Badges for specific skills and hobbies, an idea that Baden-Powell probably copied from Ernest Thompson Seton. The <b>test</b> <b>requirements</b> for Baden-Powell's scheme were revised in 1944 and again in 1958 without altering the basic structure.|$|E

2500|$|The 959 was not {{street legal}} in the United States prior to 1999 when the [...] "Show and Display" [...] law was passed, {{although}} {{an unknown number}} were imported via the [...] "grey market" [...] during the late 1980s as show pieces. During the model's development Porsche refused to provide the United States Department of Transportation with the four 959s they required for crash testing, and the car was never certified by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for street use in the U.S. In 2001, {{with the passage of}} [...] "Show and Display", the crash <b>test</b> <b>requirements</b> were removed and importation of the 959 was allowed, assuming the car could meet the emissions standards applicable in 1987. The 959 can be fitted with a catalytic converter and a re-chipped computer which allows it to meet those emissions requirements. As they are pre-1996 they would not be required to pass any emissions testing anymore: {{due to the fact that}} most 959s are now over 25 years old and therefore completely legal for US importation, they are no longer required to comply with show and display laws.|$|E
