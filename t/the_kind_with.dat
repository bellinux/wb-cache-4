In 1923, {{at the age of}} ten, Howerton joined the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, where he starred as a major attraction. The circus was the largest of <b>the</b> <b>kind,</b> <b>with</b> 800 performers and over 1000 animals. Although he was only ten years old, the circus sought to exaggerate his diminutive size by claiming that he was 18 years old. He was billed as the smallest man in the world, exhibited and known to the public under the name, [...] "Major Mite". The [...] "Major Mite" [...] moniker had previously been used by an American comedian who died in 1900, and a 19th-century circus performer, William E. Jackson, who died in 1901, at 24, [...] tall and weighing [...] Accompanied by his mother, Howerton spent 20 years with Ringling Brothers and also worked with the Cole Brothers Circus, the Coney Island Dreamland Side Show, and the World Circus Sideshow.|$|E

To Smith's proposal, Sarah replied, [...] "Am I called upon to break the marriage covenant ... to my lawful husband! I never will. I care not for the blessings of Jacob, and I believe in NO SUCH revelations, neither will I consent under any circumstances. I have one good husband, and that is enough for me."

Boundary value {{problems}} of <b>the</b> third <b>kind</b> are converted into boundary integral equations of <b>the</b> second <b>kind</b> <b>with</b> periodic logarithmic kernels by using Green’s formulas. For solving the induced boundary integral equations, a Nyström scheme and its extrapolation method are derived for periodic Fredholm integral equations of <b>the</b> second <b>kind</b> <b>with</b> logarithmic singularity. Asymptotic expansions for the approximate solutions {{obtained by the}} Nyström scheme are developed to analyze the extrapolation method. Some computational aspects of the methods are considered, and two numerical examples are given to illustrate the acceleration of convergence. 1. Introduction an...|$|R
