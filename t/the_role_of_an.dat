5|$|Chekhov had {{at first}} written stories only for {{financial}} gain, but as his artistic ambition grew, he made formal innovations which {{have influenced the}} evolution of the modern short story. He made no apologies for the difficulties this posed to readers, insisting that <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> artist was to ask questions, not to answer them.|$|E
5|$|For Cagney's next film, he {{traveled}} to Ireland for Shake Hands with the Devil, directed by Michael Anderson. Cagney had hoped {{to spend some time}} tracing his Irish ancestry, but time constraints and poor weather meant that he was unable to do so. The overriding message of violence inevitably leading to more violence attracted Cagney to <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Irish Republican Army commander, and resulted in what some critics would regard as the finest performance of his final years.|$|E
500|$|In the Soviet Union <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{producer}} {{was different}} from that in Western countries and more similar to <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> line producer or a unit production manager.|$|R
2500|$|Ozu had a {{very high}} regard for Hara's work. He said, [...] "Every Japanese actor can play <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> soldier and every Japanese actress can play <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prostitute to some extent. However, it is rare to find an actress [...] who can play <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{daughter}} from a good family." [...] Speaking of her performance in Early Summer, he was quoted as saying, [...] "Setsuko Hara {{is a really good}} actress. I wish I had four or five more like her." ...|$|R

5|$|Historian Richard Rhodes {{said that}} in his opinion it was already a foregone {{conclusion}} that Oppenheimer would have his security clearance revoked by then AEC chairman Lewis Strauss, regardless of Teller's testimony. However, as Teller's testimony was the most damning, he was singled out and blamed for the hearing's ruling, losing friends due to it, such as Robert Christy, who refused {{to shake his hand}} in one infamous incident. This was emblematic of his later treatment which resulted in his being forced into <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> outcast of the physics community, thus leaving him little choice but to align himself with industrialists.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, the J Arthur Rank Organisation, an English company, came to Australia {{to make a}} film {{adaptation}} of Robbery Under Arms, an Australian colonial novel by Rolf Boldrewood. Dodd travelled to Britain and the United States with the company for six months; in what role is unknown. He said he worked with Rafferty on a fourth film, Wake in Fright, in 1971, but Dodd's name does not appear in published cast lists. In the same year, he was cast in <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Aboriginal caretaker for a film he said was called Sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Mysts story {{concerns}} {{an explorer}} named Atrus {{who has the}} ability to write books which serve as links to other worlds, known as Ages.

The player takes <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unnamed person referred to as the Stranger and assists Atrus by traveling to other Ages and solving puzzles. Over the course of the series Atrus writes a new Age for the D'ni survivors to live on, and players of the games set the course the civilization will follow.|$|E

The primary motivation of the player is to escape the island and, in the process, deal with the forces working to steal the Shaper secrets abandoned on Sucia Isle.|$|E
5|$|The {{levels are}} {{displayed}} in an overworld with a branching, tree structure. The player must pursue multiple branches to further the story. Optional, side-story branches do not advance the main plot but have the hardest puzzles. The story is told through chains of emails, which are unlocked by completing puzzles. The player assumes <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> American Muslim National Security Agency agent who determines whether the hacked emails are pertinent to national security. The ethics of government surveillance are a core theme of the game.|$|E
5|$|The player {{takes on}} <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adventurer who is tasked with solving {{problems}} and killing monsters in a fantasy-based kingdom. The game is humorous in nature, and most quests, battles and individual item descriptions include jokes, witticisms, or references to popular culture.

5|$|Between 1993 and 1994, Vikram {{appeared}} {{in a series of}} films where he portrayed supporting roles. He {{appeared in}} three successful Malayalam films by appearing with Mammooty, Suresh Gopi and Jayaram in Joshi's successful action film Dhruvam, before teaming up with Gopi again for Shaji Kailas's Mafia, which explored Bangalore's criminal underworld. Furthermore, Joshi cast him again alongside Mammooty in the action drama Sainyam in <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> air cadet. During the period, Vikram also appeared in the small budget Telugu film Chirunavvula Varamistava in the lead role and as Akkineni Nageswara Rao's eldest son in the family drama Bangaru Kutumbam with both films failing commercially. A brief return to Tamil films also proved unsuccessful, with his role in Vikraman's multistarrer Pudhiya Mannargal with music composed by A. R. Rahman turning out to be a commercial failure.|$|E
5|$|Coalhouse Fort was manned {{during the}} First World War by No. 2 Company, Royal Garrison Artillery, which manned the guns, while the 2nd Company London Electrical Engineers {{operated}} the electric searchlights. A minefield {{was installed in}} the river between Shornemead and Coalhouse forts, with mechanically operated mines in the shallower parts {{of the river and}} remotely detonated mines in the navigable channel. Friendly ships could thus pass freely but the mines could be detonated by a shore-based observer if an enemy ship tried to use the main channel. Coalhouse Fort took on <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Examination Battery controlling the river traffic in conjunction with the River Examination Service. Incoming vessels were checked by tugs based alongside the old HMS Champion, moored in midriver, and if any vessel was deemed suspect or refused to stop, the fort was authorised to fire across its bows.|$|E
5|$|Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} in which players take <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unnamed man who explores the post-apocalyptic remains of Tokyo. Like its predecessor Megami Tensei II has players navigate dungeon environments in first-person, but between dungeons they also navigate an overworld from an overhead perspective. During their journey, the protagonist's party can visit shops and towns to gain additional story information and to purchase items using in-game currency. As they progress through the story, the protagonist is presented with morality-based dialogue options which influence how people respond to him and ultimately determine which ending is received.|$|E

5|$|Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade is a {{tactical}} role-playing game where players take {{the role of}} story protagonists Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector as they navigate story-driven missions across the fictional continent of Elibe. The player takes <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unseen tactician directing the player army. The single-player campaign is divided into chapters which generally begin with story elements presented {{through the use of}} scenes animated with still images of the main characters, then followed by a battle with an enemy; after each battle, the player is given the opportunity to save their progress. In-game currency is gained either through battles in the game's Link Arena or through other means, rather than from defeating units. Currency can be used to buy new items and weapons at merchants in between battles and at specific locations within maps. Items can also be exchanged between units during battles.|$|E
5|$|In Shin Megami Tensei, players take <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unnamed protagonist, {{a teenage}} boy who can {{communicate}} with demons using a computer program. The gameplay {{is similar to that}} of other games in the series: players make their way through dungeons and fight against demons in a first-person perspective. The protagonist uses a variety of weapons and items, with the primary weapons being swords and guns. Such items are bought from merchants scattered around the world map. In special areas, the protagonist can use the in-game currency to restore health and magic points for themselves and their demons, remove status ailments, and revive fallen demons. Special Terminals scattered across the world map allow the player to save their game, and they can use them to teleport between terminals in different areas of Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the USAF {{began looking}} for a {{replacement}} for its fighter aircraft, especially to counter the advanced Su-27 and MiG-29. A number of companies, divided into two teams, submitted their proposals. Northrop and McDonnell Douglas submitted the YF-23. Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics proposed and built the YF-22, which, although marginally slower and having a larger radar cross-section, was more agile than the YF-23. Primarily for this reason, it was picked by the Air Force as {{the winner of the}} ATF in April 1991. Following the selection, the first YF-22 was retired to a museum, while the second prototype continued flying until an accident relegated it to <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> antenna test vehicle.|$|E

5|$|Johansson {{was cast}} in <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> alien who preys on men in Scotland in Jonathan Glazer's science fiction movie Under the Skin (2013). The film, an {{adaptation}} of Michel Faber's novel of the same name, took nine years to complete. For the role, she learned to drive a van and speak with an English accent. Johansson improvised her conversations with non-professional actors on the street, who were unknowingly participating in the film; these scenes were filmed with hidden cameras. It was released to generally positive reviews, with particular praise for Johansson. Erin Whitney, writing for HuffPost, considered it her best performance to date, while taking note of her first fully nude role. It earned Johansson a BIFA Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a British Independent Film nomination.|$|E
5|$|Like all azhdarchid pterosaurs, Hatzegopteryx was {{probably}} a terrestrially foraging generalist predator. It is significantly larger than any other terrestrial predator from Maastrichtian Europe; due to its large size in an environment otherwise dominated by island dwarf dinosaurs, with no large hypercarnivorous theropods in the region, {{it has been suggested}} that Hatzegopteryx played <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> apex predator in the Haţeg Island ecosystem. The robust anatomy of Hatzegopteryx suggests that it may have tackled larger prey than other azhdarchids, including animals too large to swallow whole; similarly, some modern storks (particularly the marabou stork and the jabiru) are known to attack and kill large prey such as flamingoes, and occasionally children, with their beaks. Meanwhile, other giant azhdarchids like Arambourgiania would probably have instead fed on small prey (up to the size of a human), including hatchling or small dinosaurs and eggs. Another pterosaur, Thalassodromeus, has similarly been suggested to be raptorial.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{subsequently}} nominated Bulkeley for the Medal of Honor. The Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet, Admiral Ernest King was {{not going}} to let MacArthur award the Medal of Honor to a naval officer, so he wrote a citation for Bulkeley on behalf of the Navy. Roosevelt presented it to Bulkeley in a ceremony in the Oval Office on 4 August 1942. Bulkeley wrote a book about his exploits, entitled They Were Expendable. Parts were serialized in Reader's Digest and Life magazines and it became a bestseller in 1942. In 1944, it was adapted as a movie of the same name, with Robert Montgomery playing a character based on Bulkeley, John Wayne one based on Kelly, and Donna Reed in <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Army nurse with whom Kelly had a brief liaison. Postwar analysis found that most of the book's claims were exaggerated.|$|E
