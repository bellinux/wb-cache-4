5|$|On {{his way to}} <b>the</b> <b>gallows,</b> Beauchamp {{asked to}} see Patrick Darby, who was among the {{assembled}} spectators. Beauchamp smiled and offered his hand, but Darby declined the gesture. Beauchamp publicly denied that Darby had any involvement with the murder, but accused Darby of having lied about the 1824 meeting. Darby denied this accusation of perjury and tried to engage Beauchamp in a discussion about it, hoping he would retract the charge, but the prisoner ordered the cart driver to continue to <b>the</b> <b>gallows.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{single storey}} 1855 {{refractory}} block {{is on the}} same axis as the main cell block to its east. It consists of twelve punishment cells and six dark cells with no light. <b>The</b> <b>gallows</b> chamber, built in 1888, is between this and the main cell block and relates to the colonial use of the prison. <b>The</b> <b>gallows</b> operated via a rope tied around a beam, over a trap door, on the upper level. Opening the trap door would cause the condemned prisoner fall, and thus be hanged.|$|E
5|$|Too weak {{to stand}} or walk, Beauchamp was loaded onto a cart to be {{conveyed}} to <b>the</b> <b>gallows.</b> He begged to see Anna, but the guards {{told him she}} was not seriously injured. The guards finally allowed him to see Anna, and Beauchamp was angered that they had underplayed her critical condition. He stayed with her until he could no longer feel her pulse; then the guards took him to <b>the</b> <b>gallows</b> to be hanged before he died of his stab wounds.|$|E

5|$|Sheppard's tale {{may have}} been an {{inspiration}} for William Hogarth's 1747 series of 12 engravings, Industry and Idleness, which shows the parallel descent of an apprentice, Tom Idle, into crime and eventually to <b>the</b> <b>gallows,</b> beside the rise of his fellow apprentice, Francis Goodchild, who marries his master's daughter and takes over his business, becoming wealthy as a result, eventually emulating Dick Whittington to become Lord Mayor of London.|$|E

5|$|As soon as Fremantle Prison {{came under}} local control in 1886, a {{refractory}} block with gallows was planned. It {{was completed in}} 1888, and first used in 1889 to execute a convicted murderer, Jimmy Long, a Malayan. <b>The</b> <b>gallows</b> room was the only lawful place of execution in Western Australia between 1888 and 1984. At least 43 men and one woman were hanged in this period. Martha Rendell {{was the only woman}} to be hanged at the prison, in 1909. The last person to be hanged was serial killer Eric Edgar Cooke, executed in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp {{was convicted}} of the murder and sentenced to hang. The morning of the execution, {{he and his wife}} {{attempted}} a double suicide by stabbing themselves with a knife she had smuggled into prison. She was successful; he was not. Beauchamp was rushed to <b>the</b> <b>gallows</b> before he could bleed to death, and was hanged on July 7, 1826. The bodies of Jereboam and Anna Beauchamp were arranged in an embrace and buried in a single coffin, as they had requested. The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy inspired fictional works such as Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished play, Politian, and Robert Penn Warren's World Enough and Time (1950).|$|E

50|$|During {{the colonial}} era, the plaza {{served as a}} market, bull {{fighting}} ring, and <b>the</b> city <b>gallows.</b> <b>The</b> plaza also became home to the Auto de fe in which the inquisition occurred. The tribunal of the inquisition had one of its three courts located in Lima. The first conviction occurred on November 15, 1573 {{and this was the}} first heretic to be tried and executed in the new world.|$|R

5|$|Despite being a major {{coaching}} route, {{there were}} several obstacles along it, including the bridge over the Tyburn. A turnpike trust {{was established in the}} 1730s to improve upkeep of the road. It became notorious as the route taken by prisoners on their final journey from Newgate Prison to <b>the</b> <b>gallows</b> at Tyburn near Marble Arch. Spectators drunkenly jeered at prisoners as they carted along the road, and could buy rope used in the executions from the hangman in taverns. By about 1729, the road had become known as Oxford Street.|$|E
5|$|Forty {{years earlier}} than de Tournefort, de Thévenot {{described}} {{much the same}} process, adding that it was seldom used because it was regarded as too cruel. Some 80 years prior to de Thevenot, in 1579, Hans Jacob Breuning von Buchenbach witnessed {{a variant of the}} gaunching ritual. A large iron hook was fixed on the horizontal cross-bar of <b>the</b> <b>gallows</b> and the individual was forced upon this hook, piercing him from the abdomen through his back, so that he hung from it, hands, feet and head downward. On top of the cross bar, the executioner situated himself and performed various torture on the impaled man below him.|$|E
5|$|In October 1840, their {{paternal}} grandfather Kamanawa II requested his grandsons {{to visit}} him {{on the night before}} his execution for the murder of his wife Kamokuiki. The next morning the Cookes allowed ʻĪʻī to bring Kaliokalani and his brother Kalākaua to see Kamanawa for the last time. It is not know if their sister was also taken to see him. Later sources, especially in biographies of Kalākaua indicated that the boys witnessed the hanging of their grandfather at <b>the</b> <b>gallows.</b> Historian Helena G. Allen noted the indifference the Cookes' had toward the request and the traumatic experience it must have been for the boys.|$|E
50|$|Beerfelden has Germany’s only {{completely}} preserved gallows. They {{were built}} in 1597 to replace <b>the</b> simple wooden <b>gallows.</b> <b>The</b> last hanging here took place in 1804 when, it is said, a Gypsy woman was put to death, apparently after she stole a chicken and two loaves of bread for her sick child.|$|R

5|$|The stone {{packhorse}} bridge {{crosses the}} River Avill {{at the southern}} end of the village, below Dunster Castle at a point which may have been the limit of tidal flow during the medieval period. It was important for the transport of wool and other goods to the market within the village which was established by 1222. The name is derived from <b>the</b> nearby <b>gallows.</b> <b>The</b> narrow bridge is approach via a raised causeway for pedestrians, while wheeled traffic uses the adjacent ford.|$|R
5|$|Members of {{all work}} units were {{continuously}} beaten by {{the guards and}} often shot or hanged at <b>the</b> <b>gallows.</b> Only the strongest men were selected from new arrivals daily to obtain the necessary replacements. There were other work details which had no contact with the transports: the Holzfällerkommando ("woodcutter unit") cut and chopped firewood, and the Tarnungskommando ("disguise unit") camouflaged the structures of the camp. Another work detail was responsible for cleaning the common areas. The Camp 1 Wohnlager residential compound contained barracks for about 700 Sonderkommandos which, when combined with the 300 Totenjuden living across from the gas chambers, brought their grand total to roughly one thousand at a time.|$|E
5|$|The street {{became popular}} with entertainers {{including}} bear-baiters, theatres and public houses. However, {{it was not}} attractive to {{the middle and upper}} classes due to the nearby Tyburn gallows and St Giles, then a notorious rookery, or slum. <b>The</b> <b>gallows</b> were removed in 1783, {{and by the end of}} the century, Oxford Street was built up from St Giles Circus to Park Lane, containing a mix of residential houses and entertainment. The Princess's Theatre opened in 1840, and is now the site of Oxford Walk shopping area.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of small named-places in and around Milnrow, {{including}} Clegg, Firgrove, Gallows, Haugh, Newhey, Kitcliffe, Ogden, and Tunshill. Newhey, at the south of Milnrow by Shaw and Crompton, is the most distinct of these areas, and, with its own parish church and Metrolink station, is invariably given as a separate village. <b>The</b> <b>Gallows</b> public house is said to occupy the land of an ancient execution site; Gallows, a former hamlet at northeastern Milnrow, is named in reference to a baronial gallows. Kitcliffe, Ogden and Tunshill, to the east of central Milnrow, are hamlets that occupy the upper, mid and lower Piethorne Valley respectively.|$|E
50|$|Twenty-six {{men were}} hanged on <b>the</b> jail’s indoor <b>gallows.</b> <b>The</b> jail saw three double hangings: Roy Hotrum and William McFadden in August 1921; Leonard Jackson and Steven Suchan in December 1952; Ronald Turpin and Arthur Lucas on 11 December 1962. Turpin and Lucas had each been convicted in {{separate}} murders, and their executions were Canada's last before capital punishment was abolished.|$|R
