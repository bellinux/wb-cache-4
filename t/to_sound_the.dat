5|$|By November 1944, Strong was {{reporting}} {{that there was}} a possibility of a German counteroffensive in the Ardennes or the Vosges. Smith sent Strong to personally warn Bradley, who was preparing an offensive of his own. The magnitude and ferocity of the German Ardennes Offensive came as a shock, and Smith had to defend Strong against criticism for failing <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>the</b> alarm. He felt Bradley had been given ample warning.|$|E

Nick Balaban, who wrote the music for the show along with Michael Rubin, was cast {{as the voice of}} Mr. Salt. Balaban {{initially}} used a Brooklyn accent for Mr. Salt before settling on a French accent. Rubin also provided the voice of Mailbox.|$|E
5|$|Pipes are {{arranged}} by timbre and pitch into ranks. A rank {{is a set}} of pipes of the same timbre but multiple pitches (one for each note on the keyboard), which is mounted (usually vertically) onto a windchest. The stop mechanism admits air to each rank. For a given pipe <b>to</b> <b>sound,</b> <b>the</b> stop governing the pipe's rank must be engaged, and the key corresponding to its pitch must be depressed. Ranks of pipes are organized into groups called divisions. Each division generally is played from its own keyboard and conceptually comprises an individual instrument within the organ.|$|E

5|$|The watchmen {{were quick}} <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>the</b> alarm, {{but given the}} fire department's {{relatively}} primitive equipment, {{the fact that the}} streets of Vester Kvarter were too narrow for the fire pumps, the strange dispositions of those fighting the fire, and a series of unlucky events, the fight was nearly hopeless. The wind blew from the southwest that evening, carrying the fire along Lille Sankt Clemens Stræde, Store Sankt Clemens Stræde, Vombadstuestræde, Antiquitetsstræde and Hellig-Kors Stræde. By 9:00 p.m the main street of Vestergade was burning on both sides. From here the fire spread along Store Lars Bjørns Stræde, Lille Lars Bjørns Stræde and Studiestræde.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes, {{a single}} rank of pipes {{may be able}} to be {{controlled}} by several stops, allowing the rank to be played at multiple pitches or on multiple manuals. Such a rank is said to be unified or borrowed. For example, an 8 Diapason rank may also be made available as a 4 Octave. When both of these stops are selected and a key (for example, c) is pressed, two pipes of the same rank will sound: the pipe normally corresponding to the key played (c), and the pipe one octave above that (c). Because the 8 rank does not have enough pipes <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>the</b> top octave of the keyboard at 4 pitch, it is common for an extra octave of pipes used only for the borrowed 4 stop to be added. In this case, the full rank of pipes (now an extended rank) is one octave longer than the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} and ferocity of the German Ardennes Offensive {{came as a}} shock and Strong was criticised for failing to predict it. However Smith defended Strong against criticism for failing <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>the</b> alarm, feeling that Strong have given ample warning, which had been discounted or disregarded by himself and others. By 19 December, Strong had become concerned that the Germans were going to split Bradley's armies, and he and Whiteley – who had already received Monty's opinion on the matter – went to Smith, recommending that the armies north of the Ardennes be transferred from Bradley to Montgomery's command. Smith realised the military and political implications of this, and knew that such a recommendation had to come from an American officer. On 20 December, Smith spoke to Eisenhower, who deferred judgement until the morning staff meeting. Eisenhower then phoned Bradley and Montgomery and ordered it. The decision was greatly resented by many Americans, particularly at 12th Army Group.|$|E

25|$|To {{reach the}} quays, No.42 had first to pass over a short tramway from the BNCR goods yard to the Belfast Harbour Commissioners' tramway. To {{accomplish}} this feat required three persons {{to drive and}} conduct her, and if more than two wagons were attached, a fourth to look after them. Two of these people were equipped with red flags. While on the tramway her driver was not allowed <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>the</b> whistle, open the cylinder drain taps or allow the engine to blow off. The maximum speed was to be three miles per hour.|$|E

25|$|The {{commission}} {{stressed that}} {{this decision was}} in response to a unique set of circumstances external to the game rather than overruling an on-field umpiring decision; hence, no precedent was set for the overturning of results decided by controversial umpiring decisions, errors by goal umpires, etc. The key factor was that the timekeeper had not fulfilled his duties by failing <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>the</b> siren continuously until the umpires acknowledged the end of the game. This prevented the umpires from being able to end the game at the correct time.|$|E
25|$|Scarlett, {{notoriously}} short-sighted, remained {{unaware that}} the Russians were there. However, once he had negotiated a vineyard and the sprawling tented camp of the Light Brigade, he was notified by his ADC, Lieutenant Elliot, of {{the proximity of the}} Russian cavalry on their left flank. Scarlett gave the order 'Left wheel into line' which turned the two advanced regiments into line to face the enemy; these were shortly followed by the other two regiments forming a second line. Had the Russians charged at this moment they would have caught Scarlett's men completely disorganised, yet Ryzhov let the chance slip. Lucan, who had also seen the Russians, rode across with his staff from the Light Brigade to join the Heavies. So impatient was he to attack that he ordered his duty trumpeter, Trumpet Major Joy, <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>the</b> charge – but nothing happened. An attempt to attack before his men were in perfect alignment was contrary to every precept that the officers had learnt back in England, and it was only when the dressing had been completed to his satisfaction did Scarlett order his trumpeter, Trumpet Major Monks, <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>the</b> charge. The Heavy Brigade began to move against the Russian cavalrymen.|$|E
25|$|About {{three o'clock}} in the morning of June 2, the two {{remaining}} ships arrived at the mouth of the Combahee River at Fields Point, where Montgomery landed a small detachment under Captain Thompson. They drove off several Confederate pickets and advanced up the river. Some of the fleeing Confederates rode to the nearby village of Green Pond <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>the</b> alarm. Meanwhile, a company of the 2nd South Carolina under Captain Carver landed two miles above Fields Point at Tar Bluff and deployed into position. The two ships steamed upriver to the Nichols Plantation, where the gunboat Harriet A. Weed anchored.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Anna Fang, having {{witnessed}} the first firing of Medusa, takes Tom and Hester to the Anti-Traction League to warn them of London's plans.

Before they can, Valentine is revealed to have infiltrated the league disguised as a monk, and despite Tom recognising him and attempting <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>the</b> alarm, he succeeds in crippling their entire fleet of airships.

25|$|Merle, however, {{continuing}} his march along its original axis, was now drawing his division upon the right {{flank of the}} second Spanish line; sensing this opportunity, Bessières ordered Merle to wheel right and plunge into the Spanish flank à la baïonnette. Mouton's chasseurs appeared on the Spanish left, and under the combined pressure the Spanish line, overlapped and plunged into disorder, ruptured. The leading Spanish grenadier battalions struck their last determined blows against the French centre before being caught in this crossfire and brusquely forced off the ridge, convincing Cuesta <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> <b>the</b> retreat. As with Blake's retreat, a rearguard of regular battalions held off the French while the other formations flew north to Medina.|$|E
