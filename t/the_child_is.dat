5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> often highly distressed. <b>The</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E

In a study, the child's father is sitting; Rover enters and pleads with him to follow. They leave, with the man {{following}} the dog across the river in a boat to the slums. They enter the room where <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> hidden, and the father quickly takes the child from the beggar woman and leaves with the dog. Upon their return home, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> placed in the arms of the mother, while Rover prances happily around them.|$|E
5|$|An infant's social {{environment}} relates {{to his or}} her later language development. Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> focusing on. In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants are {{more likely to engage in}} joint attention when the parent talks about an object that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint attention is present, it plays an important role in word learning, a crucial aspect of language development.|$|E

50|$|Child auction (Barnauktion, Huutolaisuus) was a {{historical}} practice in Sweden and Finland during the 19th and early 20th Century, in which orphan and poor <b>children</b> <b>were</b> boarded out in auctions. <b>The</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> {{handed over to}} the person asking least money from the authorities. The compensation was determined in descending English auctions, where <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> present. <b>The</b> lowest bidder became <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> foster-parent and <b>was</b> compensated with an annual amount equal to his bid. The foster-parents provided <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>the</b> housing, upbringing and education, but <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> often used as a child labour.

5|$|Antibody {{tests in}} {{children}} younger than 18months are typically inaccurate due to the continued presence of maternal antibodies.

In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2007–2009 between 30 and 70% of the population were aware of their HIV status.

5|$|Concern {{with the}} harm of {{separation}} from the mother is characteristic of the belief systems behind some complementary and alternative (CAM) psychotherapies. Such belief systems are concerned {{not only with the}} effect of the young child's {{separation from the}} care of the mother, but with an emotional attachment between mother and child which advocates of these systems believe to develop prenatally. Such attachment is said to lead to emotional trauma if <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> separated from the birth mother and adopted, even if this occurs on the day of birth and even if the adoptive family provides all possible love and care. These beliefs were at one time in existence among some legitimate psychologists of psychoanalytic background.
