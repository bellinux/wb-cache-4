25|$|In the 19th century, {{the modern}} diaper {{began to take}} shape and mothers {{in many parts of the}} world used cotton material, held in place with a fastening—eventually the safety pin. Cloth diapers in the United States were first mass-produced in 1887 by Maria Allen. In the UK, nappies were made out of <b>terry</b> <b>towelling,</b> often with an inner lining made out of soft muslin.|$|E

He gave them a choice of a wire mother with a food bottle attached and a similar wire mother wrapped in <b>terry</b> <b>towelling.</b> He found that for 18 hours a day the monkeys cling to the wire mother with <b>terry</b> <b>towelling,</b> so concluded that attachment is not always about food and feeding but that attachment exist when contact comfort is present. The contact comfort is the comfort that is derived from physical closeness with a caregiver. Results from {{this study showed that}} social encounters are necessary in order for the young monkeys to develop both mentally and sexually.|$|E
50|$|Items {{that may}} be made from terrycloth include babies' {{reusable}} nappies (UK English) or diapers (US English), towels, bathrobes, bedlinen, and sweatbands for the wrist or head. Terrycloth is also sometimes used to make sweat jackets. <b>Terry</b> <b>towelling</b> hats with a shallow brim were once popular with cricketers (like English wicketkeeper Jack Russell), but {{are no longer in}} fashion.|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the fact}} that <b>towelling</b> (<b>terry</b> cloth) used for the {{fabrication}} of washcloths is a thick material, the uptake of both water and cleaning agent by the cloth is quite significant. Consequently, before reusing the washcloth, it has to be rinsed with tap water several times to remove any traces of the previous cleaning product. Otherwise, rather than detecting the new pH value, residues of the previous cleaning product will define the measured pH. In order to enable the parents or nursing staff to estimate the pH more accurately, a colour comparison chart may be used, but a yes–no decision may be sufficient, especially since there are predominantly two types of washing agents commercially available, either skin-friendly ones with a pH of around 5.5 or normal soaps with corresponding pH values around 9.|$|R

50|$|Terrycloth, terry cloth, <b>terry</b> <b>towelling,</b> terry, {{or simply}} towelling is a fabric with loops that can absorb {{large amounts of}} water. It can be {{manufactured}} by weaving or knitting. Towelling is woven on special looms that have two beams of longitudinal warp through which the filler or weft is fired laterally.

5000|$|Butcher {{was educated}} at Cambridge University and rowed for Cambridge in the Boat Race in 1947. He {{became a member}} of Thames Rowing Club. He competed at the 1948 Summer Olympics in the coxless fours. Butcher {{recalled}} that at these post-war austerity Olympics, his kit was made by his mother from <b>terry</b> <b>towelling.</b> [...] In 1949 he won the Silver Goblets at Henley, partnering Tom Christie. [...] At the 1950 British Empire Games {{he was a member of}} the English eight which won bronze medal.|$|E
50|$|As {{power looms}} were {{introduced}} into the cotton industry in north east Lancashire in the 1820s, weaving gradually became a factory industry and production moved from the home to the massive weaving sheds which began to be constructed. Until recently, {{one of the last}} examples of a working weaving shed could be seen at the East Lancashire Towel Company, but the firm, which still produces traditional <b>Terry</b> <b>towelling</b> on Lancashire looms, moved to premises in Nelson, and ceased production in the United Kingdom altogether. The site of the former mill was redeveloped by Booths, which opened in November 2014.|$|E
5000|$|... "Baggies" [...] was a name {{given to}} a {{particular}} type of jean in the early 1980s in the United Kingdom. The jeans were designed to be loose fitting around the leg, with a tight zip or button around the ankle, and had a number of zips with pockets primarily down the front of the jean. Typically there may have been ten or more pockets {{on the front of the}} jeans. They would frequently been worn with another 1980s fashion accessory, the day-glo sock, which was a <b>terry</b> <b>towelling</b> sock typically coloured in bright yellow, pink, or light blue.|$|E
50|$|John Rylands Library {{archives}} {{show that}} {{the roots of the}} Christy company date from at least 1833, when the Stockport firm of W. M. Christy & Sons Ltd - established by banker and hatter William Miller Christy - was manufacturing cotton goods. Christy's son, the noted collector and ethnologist Henry Christy, discovered the product that would make the company famous. While travelling in Istanbul, he saw an example of the looped pile fabric that is known today as <b>terry</b> <b>towelling,</b> but which was initially known as the 'Turkish towel'.The company found a method of weaving the looped pile fabric on an industrial scale using a machine designed by one of their employees Samuel Holt, who patented the design. The first Christy towels factory opened in Droylsden in 1850. A year later, Christy towels were displayed at The Great Exhibition at Crystal Palace, Queen Victoria became an early client. By 1891, the company's Fairfields Mill in Droylsden had 310 looms and 30,000 spindles, according to Worrall's Cotton Spinners Directory.|$|E
40|$|I {{have been}} told by those who may have reason to know that I am {{annoying}} in the morning. Now, esteemed readers, {{as you well know}} I am not given to unnecessary acrimony. Otherwise I might point out that clearheadedness, the ability to enunciate and to navigate between rooms without bumping into walls are not usually seen as instances of annoying behaviour— except by those given to imitating three-toed sloths in the morning. Indeed, if I were of an argumentative nature, I might point out that grumpiness, blank stares and a total inability to do anything (particularly when this nondoing is done in a blue <b>terry</b> <b>towelling</b> dressing gown) is truly annoying...|$|E
