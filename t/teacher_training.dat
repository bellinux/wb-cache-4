5|$|The Model School {{was part}} of the {{national}} schools programme proposed in 1831 in which each county in Ireland would have at least one school that would serve as an example to other national schools in the area and as a <b>teacher</b> <b>training</b> establishment (although <b>teacher</b> <b>training</b> did not take place at this particular school). Initially it had a multi-denominational intake, offered such services as night classes and industry-relevant vocational courses, and was enthusiastically supported by William Brownlow who is thought to have brought the school to the town. It was undermined, however, by church interests, which were opposed to its lack of ecclesiastical control, and criticism of the efficiency of its management, hence losing much of its earlier prestige as the premier educational establishment in the town. Over the years, the intake of Nationalist/Catholic students steadily increased, due mainly to being situated in the Catholic area of Lurgan. The student body is now almost 100% Catholic.|$|E

5|$|Maeser {{included}} the Monitorial System from Andrew Bell and Joseph Lancaster in his <b>teacher</b> <b>training</b> courses. This system suggested that more advanced students monitored the less advanced students {{and that the}} layout of a classroom should allow one teacher to oversee {{a large number of}} students.

Maeser argued that the teacher have more personal interactions with students. He implemented his monitorial organization so that each student would be responsible for something or someone else. Students were forced to look outside themselves, creating responsibility and organization.|$|E
