40|$|In <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> the net uptake of {{sulphate}} and its {{transport to}} the shoot were determined after cultivation with low, normal, and high sulphate supply. The relative {{amount of the}} sulphate taken up that was transported to the shoot {{was used as a}} measure of xylem loading. Net uptake of sulphate and its transport to the shoot were low in <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> grown with low sulphate, and high in plants cultivated with high sulphate. Xylem loading, however, was relatively low in <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> grown with high sulphate and relatively high in <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> grown with low sulphate supply. Pre-culture in low sulphate containing nutrient solution also resulted in a high proportion of the absorbed sulphate being transported into the xylem if normal sulphate concentration was supplied afterwards. Fumigation with H 2 S or SO 2 reduced net uptake of sulphate in <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> grown with normal, but not with high sulphate supply. Sulphate transport to the shoots was diminished by H 2 S or SO 2 fumigation in <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> grown with normal and high sulphate supply. Also the relative amount of the sulphate taken up that was transported to the shoot was lowered by fumigation with H 2 S or SO 2 in <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> grown with normal sulphate supply. Apparently, the diminished sulphate transport to the shoot upon H 2 S or SO 2 fumigation can only partially be explained by a smaller sulphate uptake. Sulphur nutrition of <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> also seems to be controlled by xylem loading of sulphate. The possible role of glutathione as a signal regulating sulphur nutrition of <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> upon fumigation with H 2 S and SO 2 is discussed...|$|R

40|$|First {{published}} as an Advance Article {{on the web}} 12 th May 2003 Previous {{studies have shown that}} <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> are tolerant of perchlorate and will accumulate perchlorate in plant tissues. This research determined the uptake, translocation, and accumulation of perchlorate in <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants.</b> Three hydroponics growth studies were completed under greenhouse conditions. Depletion of perchlorate in the hydroponics nutrient solution and accumulation of perchlorate in plant tissues were determined at two-day intervals using ion chromatography. Perchlorate primarily accumulated in tobacco leaves, yielding a substantial storage capacity for perchlorate.

Sorg, owner of a <b>tobacco</b> <b>plant</b> east of Middletown, was unhappy with the service provided by the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad (then independent) and Cincinnati and Springfield Railway (Big Four system), both of which bypassed the center of town. Sorg and associates incorporated the M in early 1890, and surveyed a [...] line from Middletown, which lay in the Great Miami River valley, southeast to a point that would be known as Middletown Junction on the Little Miami Railroad (Pennsylvania system). Construction on the majority of the route, which crossed the CL at Hageman, was complete by September 1891, and a [...] truss bridge over the Little Miami River opened in early 1892, linking the line to the Pennsylvania. Access into central Middletown was delayed until December, when it was finally able to cross the CH to its depot. As opposed to the CL and DL, the M was straight and flat, giving a smooth ride, and turned a reasonable profit. The revenue was not enough, however, to pay off the bonds, and the M entered receivership in July 1894. The holders of liens against the property bought the line at foreclosure in October for $335,000, incorporated the Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad in December, and elected Sorg president.|$|E

Agrobacterium based system was employed to transfer a vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter (AtNHX 1) gene into tobacco leaf discs. Hundred thirty putative transgenic <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> were obtained. The leaf painting assay was applied to select the transformants containing the bar gene (basta herbicide resistance). In addition, the stable integration of the AtNHX 1 gene was confirmed by PCR analysis.
