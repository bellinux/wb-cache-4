500|$|Despite time {{constraints}} imposed on {{him by the}} expansion of his business, Boulton continued his [...] "philosophical" [...] work (as scientific experimentation was then called). [...] He wrote in his notebooks observations on the freezing and boiling point of mercury, on people's pulse rates at different ages, on {{the movements of the}} planets, and on how to make sealing wax and disappearing ink. [...] However, Erasmus Darwin, another fellow enthusiast who {{became a member of the}} Lunar Society, wrote to him in 1763, [...] "As you are now become a sober plodding Man of Business, I scarcely dare trouble you <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>me</b> a favour in the... philosophical way." ...|$|E
500|$|Como's {{comments}} {{during a}} 1949 interview were prophetic, {{as far as}} his success was concerned. At the time he was doing the Chesterfield Supper Club on both radio and television, [...] "Television is going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>me</b> a lot more personal good than the movies ever have... The reason should be obvious. On television, I'm allowed to be myself; in pictures, I was always some other guy. I come over like just another bum in a tuxedo." [...] Como was offered some movie roles [...] that interested him after he began appearing on the weekly TV shows, but there was just never enough time to pursue any film work.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, Harry Truman called Smathers into {{a meeting}} at the White House and {{reportedly}} said, [...] "I want you <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>me</b> a favor. I want you to beat that son-of-a-bitch Claude Pepper." [...] Pepper had been part of an unsuccessful 1948 campaign to [...] "dump Truman" [...] as the Democratic presidential nominee, and Smathers had been his manager and pupil. Smathers challenged the incumbent senator in the Democratic primary and won by a margin of over 60,000 votes. The race was marked by echoes of the Red Scare. Smathers repeatedly attacked Pepper for having Communist sympathies, pointing out his pro-civil rights platform and campaign for universal health care as well as his travels to the Soviet Union in 1945.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the main}} reasons for doubting the truth of the inquest {{concerns}} the reliability of Marlowe's companions as witnesses. As an agent provocateur for the late Sir Francis Walsingham, Robert Poley was a consummate liar, the [...] "very genius of the Elizabethan underworld", and is even on record as saying [...] "I will swear and forswear myself, rather than I will accuse myself <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>me</b> any harm." [...] The other witness, Nicholas Skeres, had for many years acted as a confidence trickster, drawing young men into the clutches of people in the money-lending racket, including Marlowe's apparent killer, Ingram Frizer, with whom he was currently engaged in just such a swindle. In other words, despite their being referred to as [...] "generosi" [...] (gentlemen) in the inquest report, they were all professional liars.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the 1950 Florida Senate election, President Harry Truman called George Smathers into {{a meeting}} at the White House and {{reportedly}} said, [...] "I want you <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>me</b> a favor. I want you to beat that son-of-a-bitch Claude Pepper." [...] Pepper had been part of an unsuccessful 1948 campaign to [...] "dump Truman" [...] as the Democratic presidential nominee. Smathers ran against him in the Democratic primary (which at the time in Florida was tantamount to election, the Republican Party still being in infancy there). The contest was extremely heated, and revolved around policy issues, especially charges that Pepper represented the far left and was too supportive of Stalin. Pepper's opponents circulated widely a 49-page booklet titled The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper. Pepper was defeated in the primary by Smathers.|$|E
