5|$|Cold {{seawater}} {{is used in}} the Seawater Greenhouse to both {{cool and}} humidify the interior of greenhouse-like structure. The cooling can be so effective that not only do the plants inside benefit from reduced <b>transpiration,</b> but dew collects {{on the outside of the}} structure and can easily be collected by gutters.|$|E
5|$|Spines, {{which are}} {{modified}} leaves, are present on even those cacti with true leaves, showing {{the evolution of}} spines preceded the loss of leaves. Although spines have a high surface area-to-volume ratio, at maturity they contain little or no water, being composed of fibers made up of dead cells. Spines provide protection from herbivores and camouflage in some species, and assist in water conservation in several ways. They trap air near {{the surface of the}} cactus, creating a moister layer that reduces evaporation and <b>transpiration.</b> They can provide some shade, which lowers the temperature of the surface of the cactus, also reducing water loss. When sufficiently moist air is present, such as during fog or early morning mist, spines can condense moisture, which then drips onto the ground and is absorbed by the roots.|$|E
5|$|The Western Ghats {{extend from}} the Satpura Range in the north, {{stretching}} from Gujarat to Tamil Nadu. It traverses south past {{the states of}} Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka and Kerala. Major gaps in the range are the Goa Gap, between the Maharashtra and Karnataka sections, and the Palghat Gap on the Tamil Nadu and Kerala border between the Nilgiri Hills and the Anaimalai Hills. The mountains intercept the rain-bearing westerly monsoon winds, and are consequently an area of high rainfall, particularly on their western side. The dense forests {{also contribute to the}} precipitation of the area by acting as a substrate for condensation of moist rising orographic winds from the sea, and releasing much of the moisture back into the air via <b>transpiration,</b> allowing it to later condense and fall again as rain.|$|E
5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} {{fresh water}} {{is the result of}} precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and <b>transpiration</b> of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible {{in the northern part of}} Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{accumulation}} {{will also}} affect pasture, plants and trees which {{are part of}} the horticulture and agriculture industries. Thin ash falls (<20 mm) may put livestock off eating, and can inhibit <b>transpiration</b> and photosynthesis and alter growth. There may be an increase in pasture production due to a mulching effect and slight fertilizing effect, such as occurred following the 1980 Mount St. Helens and 1995/96 Mt Ruapehu eruptions. Heavier falls will completely bury pastures and soil leading to death of pasture and sterilization of the soil due to oxygen deprivation. Plant survival is dependent on ash thickness, ash chemistry, compaction of ash, amount of rainfall, duration of burial and the length of plant stalks at the time of ash fall. The acidic nature of ash will lead to elevated soil sulfur levels and lowered soil pH, which can reduce the availability of essential minerals and alter the soilâ€™s characteristics so that crops and plants will not survive. Ash will also impact upon arable crops, such as fruit, vegetables and grain. Ash can burn plant and crop tissue reducing quality, contaminate crops during harvest and damage plants from ash loading.|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{are present}} in both North and South America with a post-Gondwana origin. Other xerophytic plants have {{developed}} similar strategies by {{a process known as}} convergent evolution. They limit water loss by reducing the size and number of stomata, by having waxy coatings and hairy or tiny leaves. Some are deciduous, shedding their leaves in the driest season, and others curl their leaves up to reduce <b>transpiration.</b> Others store water in succulent leaves or stems or in fleshy tubers. Desert plants maximize water uptake by having shallow roots that spread widely, or by developing long taproots that reach down to deep rock strata for ground water. The saltbush in Australia has succulent leaves and secretes salt crystals, enabling it to live in saline areas. In common with cacti, many have developed spines to ward off browsing animals.|$|E
5|$|The first cacti {{are thought}} to have been only {{slightly}} succulent shrubs or small trees whose leaves carried out photosynthesis. They lived in tropical areas that experienced periodic drought. If Pereskia clade A is a good model of these early cacti, then, although they would have appeared superficially similar to other trees growing nearby, they had already evolved strategies to conserve water (some of which are present in members of other families in the order Caryophyllales). These strategies included being able to respond rapidly to periods of rain, and keeping <b>transpiration</b> low by using water very efficiently during photosynthesis. The latter was achieved by tightly controlling the opening of stomata. Like Pereskia species today, early ancestors may have been able to switch from the normal C3 mechanism, where carbon dioxide is used continuously in photosynthesis, to CAM cycling, in which when the stomata are closed, carbon dioxide produced by respiration is stored for later use in photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|The main ways {{water vapor}} {{is added to}} the air are: wind {{convergence}} into areas of upward motion, precipitation or virga falling from above, daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land, <b>transpiration</b> from plants, cool or dry air moving over warmer water, and lifting air over mountains. Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Elevated portions of weather fronts (which are three-dimensional in nature) force broad areas of upward motion within the Earth's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus. Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass. It can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions.|$|E
25|$|Water on Earth moves {{continually}} {{through the}} water cycle of evaporation and <b>transpiration</b> (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea. Evaporation and <b>transpiration</b> contribute to the precipitation over land. Large amounts of water are also chemically combined or adsorbed in hydrated minerals.|$|E
25|$|With green roofs, {{water is}} stored by the {{substrate}} and then {{taken up by}} the plants from where it is returned to the atmosphere through <b>transpiration</b> and evaporation.|$|E
25|$|Moisture {{is a major}} {{limiting}} factor on land. Terrestrial organisms are constantly confronted {{with the problem of}} dehydration. <b>Transpiration</b> or evaporation of water from plant surfaces is an energy dissipating process unique to the terrestrial environment.|$|E
25|$|Fundamental {{processes}} such as photosynthesis, respiration, plant nutrition, {{plant hormone}} functions, tropisms, nastic movements, photoperiodism, photomorphogenesis, circadian rhythms, environmental stress physiology, seed germination, dormancy and stomata function and <b>transpiration,</b> both parts of plant water relations, are studied by plant physiologists.|$|E
25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and cooling, see Air flow paths below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be cooled with air flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, air cooling is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and <b>transpiration</b> cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of cool air that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, <b>transpiration</b> cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of cooling air to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of cooling air required. <b>Transpiration</b> cooling results in a much more even temperature profile, as the cooling air is uniformly introduced through pores. Film cooling air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, <b>transpiration</b> cooling uses much less cooling air (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film cooling). Using less air for cooling allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|E
25|$|Decreasing stomatal {{density is}} one way plants {{have responded to the}} {{increase}} in concentration of atmospheric CO2 (atm). Although changes in atm response is the least understood mechanistically, this stomatal response has begun to plateau where it is soon expected to impact <b>transpiration</b> and photosynthesis processes in plants.|$|E
25|$|For plant leaf wax, the {{relative}} humidity, {{the timing of}} leaf wax formation and the growth conditions including light levels affect the D/H fractionation of plant wax. From the Craigâ€“Gordon model, it can be understood that leaf water in the growth chamber gasses is significantly D-enriched due to <b>transpiration.</b>|$|E
25|$|Carbon dioxide, a key {{reactant}} in photosynthesis, {{is present}} in the atmosphere at a concentration of about 400 ppm. Most plants require the stomata to be open during daytime. The air spaces in the leaf are saturated with water vapour, which exits the leaf through the stomata; this is known as <b>transpiration.</b> Therefore, plants cannot gain carbon dioxide without simultaneously losing water vapour.|$|E
25|$|Stomata (or leaf pores) are {{involved}} in both uptake of carbon dioxide gas from the atmosphere and water vapor losses from the leaf due to water <b>transpiration.</b> Basic physiological investigation of these gas exchange processes has yielded valuable carbon isotope based methods that are used for breeding wheat varieties with improved water-use efficiency. These varieties can improve crop productivity in rain-fed dry-land wheat farms.|$|E
25|$|Aquifer {{drawdown}} or overdrafting and the pumping {{of fossil}} water increases {{the total amount}} of water within the hydrosphere subject to <b>transpiration</b> and evaporation processes, thereby causing accretion in water vapour and cloud cover, the primary absorbers of infrared radiation in the earth's atmosphere. Adding water to the system has a forcing effect on the whole earth system, an accurate estimate of which hydrogeological fact is yet to be quantified.|$|E
25|$|Mulga has {{developed}} extensive adaptations to the Australian desert. Like many Acacia species, it has thick-skinned phyllodes. These are optimised for low water loss, {{with a high}} oil content, sunken stomata, and a profusion of tiny hairs to reduce <b>transpiration.</b> During dry periods, a mulga drops much of its foliage to the ground, which provides an extra layer of mulch and from where the nutrients can be recycled.|$|E
25|$|When a soil {{becomes too}} dry, plant <b>transpiration</b> drops because {{the water is}} {{increasingly}} bound to the soil particles by suction. Below the wilting point plants are {{no longer able to}} extract water. At this point they wilt and cease transpiring altogether. Conditions where soil is too dry to maintain reliable plant growth is referred to as agricultural drought, and is a particular focus of irrigation management. Such conditions are common in arid and semi-arid environments.|$|E
25|$|The {{extensive}} use of surgery, mummification practices, and autopsy as a religious exercise gave Egyptians a vast knowledge of the body's morphology, and even a considerable understanding of organ functions. The function of most major organs was correctly presumedâ€”for example, blood was correctly guessed to be a <b>transpiration</b> medium for vitality and waste which is {{not too far from}} its actual role in carrying oxygen and removing carbon dioxideâ€”with the exception of the heart and brain whose functions were switched.|$|E
25|$|Ordinarily, {{carbon dioxide}} is fixed to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) by the enzyme RuBisCO in {{mesophyll}} cells exposed directly to the air spaces inside the leaf. This exacerbates the <b>transpiration</b> problem for two reasons: first, RuBisCo has a relatively low affinity for carbon dioxide, and second, it fixes oxygen to RuBP, wasting energy and carbon in a process called photorespiration. For both of these reasons, RuBisCo needs high carbon dioxide concentrations, which means wide stomatal apertures and, as a consequence, high water loss.|$|E
25|$|Warm {{temperature}} {{in the range of}} 23-28 Celsius and the high relative humidity (>80%) are optimal environments for Clavibacter michiganesis subsp. michiganesis, a tomato bacterial canker symptom development. In humid or wet weather, slimy masses of bacteria ooze through the cracks {{to the surface of the}} stem, from which they are spread to leaves and fruits and cause secondary infections Infected host plants will show severe symptoms on hot days when there is a high <b>transpiration</b> rate since the bacteria may plug the xylem vessels.|$|E
25|$|The CO2 {{fertiliser}} {{effect has}} been greatly overestimated during Free-Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE) experiments where results show increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere enhances photosynthesis, reduce <b>transpiration,</b> and increase water use efficiency (WUE). Increased biomass {{is one of the}} effects with simulations from experiments predicting a 5â€“20% increase in crop yields at 550 ppm of CO2. Rates of leaf photosynthesis were shown to increase by 30â€“50% in C3 plants, and 10â€“25% in C4 under doubled CO2 levels. The existence of a feedback mechanism results a phenotypic plasticity in response to atm that may have been an adaptive trait in the evolution of plant respiration and function.|$|E
25|$|Irradiation {{reduces the}} risk of {{infection}} and spoilage, does not make food radioactive, and the food is shown to be safe, but it does cause chemical reactions that alter the food and therefore alters the chemical makeup, nutritional content, and the sensory qualities of the food. Some of the potential secondary impacts of irradiation are hypothetical, while others are demonstrated. These effects include cumulative impacts to pathogens, people, and the environment due to the reduction of food quality, the <b>transpiration</b> and storage of radioactive goods, and destruction of pathogens, changes in the way we relate to food and how irradiation changes the food production and shipping industries.|$|E
25|$|Salicylic acid (SA) is a {{phenolic}} phytohormone and {{is found}} in plants with roles in plant growth and development, photosynthesis, <b>transpiration,</b> ion uptake and transport. SA also induces specific changes in leaf anatomy and chloroplast structure. SA is involved in endogenous signaling, mediating in plant defense against pathogens. It {{plays a role in}} the resistance to pathogens by inducing the production of pathogenesis-related proteins. It is involved in the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in which a pathogenic attack on one part of the plant induces resistance in other parts. The signal can also move to nearby plants by salicylic acid being converted to the volatile ester, methyl salicylate.|$|E
25|$|The carbon-bonded {{hydrogen}} {{isotopic composition}} of cellulose, as inherited from leaf water, {{has the potential}} of preserving the original meteoric water signal. This was first demonstrated in the 1970s. In a systematic survey across North America, tree cellulose Î´D was found to have a temperature sensitivity of 5.8â€°/Â°C, similar to precipitation Î´D sensitivity of 5.6â€°/Â°C. This spatial correlation may be complicated by local effects of soil evaporation and leaf <b>transpiration,</b> and the spatial gradient may not be representative of temporal changes in tree ring cellulose at a single place. The mechanism that generates the Î´D signal in cellulose from meteoric water is not completely understood, but at least includes leaf water <b>transpiration,</b> synthesis of carbohydrates, synthesis of cellulose from photosynthetic sugars, and exchange of sugars with xylem water. Modeling studies show that observed tree ring cellulose Î´D can be produced when 36% of the hydrogen in sugars can exchange with xylem water, and effects such as humidity and rainfall seasonality may complicate the cellulose Î´D proxy. Despite these complications, tree ring Î´D have been used for paleoclimate reconstructions of the past few millennia. For example, a tree ring cellulose Î´D records from pine trees in the White Mountains, California shows a 50â€° depletion from 6800 year ago to present. The cooling trend since the mid-Holocene thermal maximum is consistent with ice core and pollen records, but the corresponding magnitude of cooling is elusive due to complicated influences from local effects such as humidity and soil water composition. The meaning of isotopes in cellulose and its applications is still an area of active study.|$|E
25|$|C3 plant {{metabolism}} was chronologically first. It requires {{large amounts}} of water (which is lost through <b>transpiration),</b> moderate temperatures and moderate sunlight. About 95% of plants are C3. In places where the water supply is minimal, the temperature is too high, or the sunlight too bright, C3 plants cannot thrive, but C4 metabolism evolved at multiple locations convergently within the same families by a slight alteration of the metabolic process. It requires {{a fraction of the}} water, and thrives in warmer environments and bright sunlight. C4 plants spread where C3 plants must decline. About 5% of the Earth's plants are C4, far less than for grasses, for which the number is 46%.|$|E
25|$|Fire has {{important}} {{effects on the}} abiotic (non-living) components of an ecosystem, particularly the soil. Fire can affect the soil by direct contact with it and by its effects on the plant community associated with it. By removing overhead vegetation, fire can lead to increased solar radiation on the soil surface by day, resulting in greater warming, and to greater cooling through the loss of radiative heat at night. Fewer leaves left to intercept rain will allow more moisture to reach the soil surface. In addition, plant <b>transpiration</b> (the process by which water travels through plants and evaporates through pores in the leaves) will be reduced following a fire, allowing the soil to retain more moisture.|$|E
25|$|The {{water content}} of the {{atmosphere}} {{as a whole is}} constantly depleted by precipitation. At the same time it is constantly replenished by evaporation, most prominently from seas, lakes, rivers, and moist earth. Other sources of atmospheric water include combustion, respiration, volcanic eruptions, the <b>transpiration</b> of plants, and various other biological and geological processes. The mean global content of water vapor in the atmosphere is roughly sufficient to cover the surface of the planet with a layer of liquid water about 25mm deep. The mean annual precipitation for the planet is about 1 meter, which implies a rapid turnover of water in the air â€“ on average, the residence time of a water molecule in the troposphere is about 9 to 10 days.|$|E
25|$|Fog {{begins to}} form when water vapor {{condenses}} into tiny liquid water droplets {{suspended in the}} air. Six examples of ways that water vapor {{is added to the}} air are by wind convergence into areas of upward motion; precipitation or virga falling from above; daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies, or wet land; <b>transpiration</b> from plants; cool or dry air moving over warmer water; and lifting air over mountains. Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Fog, like its elevated cousin stratus, is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass.|$|E
25|$|Bonsai {{cultivation}} {{and care}} involves the long-term cultivation of small trees in containers, called bonsai in the Japanese tradition of this art form. Similar practices exist in other Japanese art forms {{and in other}} cultures, including saikei (Japanese), penjing (Chinese), and hÃ²n non bá»™ (Vietnamese). Trees are difficult to cultivate in containers, which restrict root growth, nutrition uptake, and resources for <b>transpiration</b> (primarily soil moisture). In addition to the root constraints of containers, bonsai trunks, branches, and foliage are extensively shaped and manipulated to meet aesthetic goals. Specialized tools and techniques are used to protect the health and vigor of the subject tree. Over time, the artistic manipulation of small trees in containers {{has led to a}} number of cultivation and care approaches that successfully meet the practical and the artistic requirements of bonsai and similar traditions.|$|E
25|$|Small trees {{grown in}} containers, like bonsai, require {{specialized}} care. Unlike most houseplants, flowering shrubs, and other subjects of container gardening, tree {{species in the}} wild generally grow individual roots up to several meters long and root structures encompassing {{hundreds or thousands of}} liters of soil. In contrast, a typical bonsai container allows a fraction of a meter for root extension, and holds 2 to 10 liters of soil and root mass. Branch and leaf (or needle) growth in trees is also large-scale in nature. Wild trees typically grow 5 meters or taller when mature, while the largest bonsai rarely exceed 1 meter and most specimens are significantly smaller. These size differences affect maturation, <b>transpiration,</b> nutrition, pest resistance, and many other aspects of tree biology. Maintaining the long-term health of a tree in a container requires a number of specialized care techniques.|$|E
25|$|The {{horizontal}} {{structure of}} each lens {{is influenced by}} variations in the type and porosity of the subsurface deposits, which on Diego Garcia are minor. At depth, the lens is globular; near the surface, it generally conforms {{to the shape of}} the island. When a Ghyben-Herzberg lens is fully formed, its floating nature will push a freshwater head above mean sea level, and if the island is wide enough, the depth of the lens below mean sea level will be 40 times the height of the water table above sea level. On Diego Garcia, this equates to a maximum depth of 20 m. However, the actual size and depth of each lens is dependent on the width and shape of the island at that point, the permeability of the aquifer, and the equilibrium between recharging rainfall and losses to evaporation to the atmosphere, <b>transpiration</b> by plants, tidal advection, and human use.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrogen}} isotope {{composition of}} leaf waxes {{can be summarized}} as the Î´D of rain water, with three main fractionation steps- evaporation from soil water, <b>transpiration</b> from leaf water, and lipid biosynthesis, which can be combined and measured as the net fractionation, or Îµl/w. With the application of ever-improving measurement techniques for single molecules, and correlation with other independent proxies in the geological record that can help constrain some variables, investigating the hydrogen isotope composition of leaf waxes can be extremely productive. Leaf wax Î´D data has been successfully applied to improving our understanding of climate driven changes in terrestrial hydrology, by demonstrating that ocean circulation and surface temperature {{have a significant effect}} on continental precipitation. Leaf wax Î´D values have also been used as records of paleoaltimetry to reconstruct the elevation gradients in ancient mountain ranges based on the effect of altitude on rain water Î´D.|$|E
25|$|Various {{physical}} and physiological forces like light intensity, humidity, temperature, wind speeds etc. {{are thought to}} have influenced evolution of leaf shape and size. It is observed that high trees rarely have large leaves, owing to the obstruction they generate for winds. This obstruction can eventually lead to the tearing of leaves, if they are large. Similarly, trees that grow in temperate or taiga regions have pointed leaves, presumably to prevent nucleation of ice onto the leaf surface and reduce water loss due to <b>transpiration.</b> Herbivory, not only by large mammals, but also small insects has been implicated as a driving force in leaf evolution, an example being plants of the genus Aciphylla, that are commonly found in New Zealand. The now-extinct moas (birds) fed upon these plants, and the spines on the leaves probably discouraged the moas from feeding on them. Other members of Aciphylla that did not co-exist with the moas were spineless.|$|E
