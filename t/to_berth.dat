5|$|Iowa was {{decommissioned}} for {{the last}} time in October 1990 after 19 total years of active service, and was initially stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in 1995. She was reinstated from 1999 to 2006 to comply with federal laws that required retention and maintenance of two Iowa-class battleships. In 2011 Iowa was donated to the Los Angeles–based non-profit Pacific Battleship Center and was permanently moved <b>to</b> <b>Berth</b> 87 at the Port of Los Angeles in 2012, where she was opened to the public as the USS Iowa Museum.|$|E
5|$|The River Lea was {{a smaller}} {{boundary}} than the Thames, {{but it was}} a significant one. The building of the Royal Docks consisting of the Royal Victoria Dock (1855), able <b>to</b> <b>berth</b> vessels of up to 8000tons; Royal Albert Dock (1880), up to 12,000tons; and King George V Dock (1921), up to 30,000tons, on the estuary marshes, extended the continuous development of London across the Lea into Essex for the first time. The railways gave access to a passenger terminal at Gallions Reach and new suburbs created in West Ham, which quickly became a major manufacturing town, with 30,000 houses built between 1871 and 1901. Soon afterwards, East Ham was built up to serve the new Gas Light and Coke Company and Bazalgette's grand sewage works at Beckton.|$|E
5|$|The West India Docks were {{established}} in 1803, providing berths for larger ships and a model for future London dock building. Imported produce from the West Indies was unloaded directly into quayside warehouses. Ships were limited to 6000tons. The old Brunswick Dock, a shipyard at Blackwall {{became the basis for}} the East India Company's East India Docks established there in 1806. The London Docks were built in 1805, and the waste soil and rubble from the construction was carried by barge to west London, to build up the marshy area of Pimlico. These docks imported tobacco, wine, wool and other goods into guarded warehouses within high walls (some of which still remain). They were able <b>to</b> <b>berth</b> over 300 sailing vessels simultaneously, but by 1971 they closed, no longer able to accommodate modern shipping. The most central docks, St Katharine Docks, were built in 1828 to accommodate luxury goods, clearing the slums that lay {{in the area of the}} former Hospital of St Katharine. They were not successful commercially, as they were unable to accommodate the largest ships, and in 1864, management of the docks was amalgamated with that of the London Docks. The Millwall Docks were created in 1868, predominantly for the import of grain and timber. These docks housed the first purpose built granary for the Baltic grain market, a local landmark that remained until it was demolished to improve access for the London City Airport.|$|E

50|$|Ship-to-shore {{gantry cranes}} {{are some of}} the largest {{examples}} of gantry cranes in the world and serve the special purpose of moving shipping containers from container ships <b>to</b> <b>berths</b> for unloading and from <b>berths</b> <b>to</b> container ships for loading.

25|$|Due to {{extensive}} {{damage from the}} Japanese bombing run, Enterprise was forced to retire <b>to</b> <b>berth</b> in the Tonga Islands, steaming steadily in that direction until it arrived 30 August 1942. By the time it reached port it had disembarked Air Group 6; upon its return to action in October, Enterprise would instead carry Air Group 10.|$|E
25|$|Bundaberg {{experienced}} severe flooding, {{the worst}} in 40 years, after the Burnett River flooded the city, although the Paradise Dam reservoir contributed to some flood mitigation. This resulted in the evacuation of 300 homes. The Bundaberg Port, a major sugar exporting facility, was closed late in December 2010 as flooding deposited silt in the port, forcing its closure. The port re-opened in early March 2011 after successful dredging operations allowed ships <b>to</b> <b>berth.</b>|$|E
25|$|The kingdom {{was founded}} by James Brooke, an English adventurer who arrived to the banks of Sarawak River and decided <b>to</b> <b>berth</b> his {{schooner}} there in 1839. After serving in the First Anglo-Burmese War where he was severely wounded in battle, Brooke returned to England in 1825 to recover from his injury. Despite his attempts to return into service, {{he was unable to}} return to his station in India before his temporary leave from the service expired. Overstaying his furlough resulting in his position in the military being forfeited, but he was awarded a pension by the government for his service. He continued on from India and went to China to improve his health.|$|E

25|$|On 2 May 2011, the {{cancellation}} of a Scillonian III sailing on the bank holiday after the World Pilot Gig Championships weekend left visitors stranded on St Mary's. Two sailings were scheduled that day to take gig rowers home. Scillonian III departed for the first sailing as planned, but with weather conditions worsening in the strong Easterlies and waves crashing onto the pier in Penzance it became unsafe <b>to</b> <b>berth</b> {{and she had to}} spend three hours circling in Mount's Bay, waiting until high tide with 450 passengers on board. When the second sailing was then cancelled, council staff opened up emergency accommodation at their Carn Thomas offices and Town Hall to provide shelter for visitors stranded on St Mary's.|$|E
25|$|Minna also {{obtained}} {{a position at}} the Riga theater, and they lived in Riga for two years until Wagner lost his post in January 1839. He then decided on a wild scheme to evade his creditors: He and Minna together with their dog Robber would flee across the nearby Russian border and board a ship bound for London and then travel on to Paris, where Wagner expected that his new opera Rienzi would make his fortune. Minna made her last stage appearance in Riga on April 18 {{in the title role}} of Schiller's Maria Stuart. It was her income from this appearance that paid for their flight from Riga to London and Paris. On July 10, they made the illegal border crossing safely, despite the risk of being shot by border guards, but on 14 July they were in a wagon which overturned, crushing Minna. Nathalie later claimed that Minna suffered a miscarriage as a result. While there is no other evidence for this claim, {{it is a fact that}} Minna bore Wagner no children. Minna and Wagner set sail from Pillau on the Thetis and ran into a storm which led them <b>to</b> <b>berth</b> in a Norwegian fjord. They only arrived in London after a terrifying 24-day journey for a trip that should normally have taken 8 days. After a week recovering in London, they took a steamer to Paris.|$|E

50|$|The berth {{allocation}} problem (also {{known as}} the berth scheduling problem) is a NP-complete problem in operations research, regarding the allocation of berth space for vessels in container terminals. Vessels arrive over time and the terminal operator needs to assign them <b>to</b> <b>berths</b> <b>to</b> be served (loading and unloading containers) as soon as possible. Different factors affect the berth and time assignment of each vessel.|$|R

500|$|In February 2010, the Pacific Battleship Center (PBC) {{was behind}} efforts {{to have the}} ship berthed in San Pedro, Los Angeles, California. In late February the Port of Los Angeles (which {{includes}} the San Pedro area) rejected a proposal by the PBC <b>to</b> <b>berth</b> the battleship at its facilities because the battleship was not yet available. [...] On 12 April 2010, the Governor of Iowa signed into law Bill SJR2007, which officially formed a 10-member committee to raise about $5million for the group awarded the USS Iowa. The statement supporting the Vallejo group in the original Iowa State Senate's version SR19 was struck in favor of supporting any group actually awarded the battleship.|$|E
500|$|The {{conflict}} was generally seen locally as outside [...] "meddlers" [...] – state officials, rich [...] "out-of-state bleeding hearts", and historians – interfering with local plans that {{would improve the}} city. Robert P. Turk, director of the Redevelopment Agency, wrote a letter accusing preservationists of dealing in [...] "pure academic nonsense". Frank Scheetz, a Groton local and former submariner, attempted to buy the station {{for use as a}} submarine museum, with plans <b>to</b> <b>berth</b> a decommissioned submarine nearby. The Redevelopment Agency rejected Scheetz's offer, claiming he was a speculator; Scheetz alleged that the city duplicitously changed prices in order to refuse the legitimate offer. (Scheetz later funded the display of the USS Croaker in Groton from 1977 to 1987, and was [...] "instrumental" [...] in bringing the USS Nautilus to permanent display at Submarine Force Library and Museum at the Naval Submarine Base New London in the 1980s.) In September 1973, the City Council voted to allow demolition. Amtrak responded with a letter stating that the company wanted to discuss the possibility of preservation and would be willing to contribute financially. That year, a number of the same local activists formed the Union Railroad Station Trust, intending to restore the station.|$|E
500|$|To {{reconstruct}} No. 1's existing runway as an all-weather strip, {{the bomb}} craters {{had to have}} the water pumped out of them and then be filled in. Sandstone from a quarry on northern Labuan was placed over the clay and sand subbase, and the runway was topped with crushed coral from the west coast of the island, and sealed with bitumen. The [...] runway had 70 hardstandings for aircraft. With 70 also on the dry weather strip, the air base could accommodate 140 aircraft. The 9th Division's engineers also undertook a wide range of construction projects on Labuan. These included building [...] of storage, new port facilities, bridges and oil tanks as well as surfacing [...] of roads. A wharf for Liberty ships was begun on 18 June, allowing the first ship <b>to</b> <b>berth</b> on 10 July. A fuel jetty was in operation by 20 June, and a fuel tank farm with seven [...] tanks was completed on 12 July, as was a 600-bed hospital. Work then began on a 1,200-bed general hospital. The 2/4th and 2/6th Australian General Hospitals were transferred from Morotai to Labuan during July, though the later unit's hospital facilities were not completed until 17 September.|$|E
