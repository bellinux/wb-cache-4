5|$|In February 2010, the IMA {{announced}} {{the launch of}} IMA Lab, a consulting service within the museum's technology department. IMA Lab was designed to address museum-specific technology needs not currently met by software vendors and to provide consulting services to museums and nonprofit organizations <b>that</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> use technology to help solve problems and meet objectives. IMA Lab projects include TAP, steve.museum, and the IMA Dashboard. TAP is a mobile tour application for iPod Touch that presents visitors with content related to the IMA's collection, such as artist interviews, text and audio files, and pictures. Steve.museum, for which IMA Lab is the technical lead, is a project that explores social tagging as {{a new way to}} describe collections and make them more accessible.|$|E
5|$|UNITY is {{a secret}} {{international}} organization headquartered somewhere in England that protects humanity from outsiders <b>that</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> take over the world. In 1960, {{over half of the}} UNITY's elite agents are murdered by an unknown assassin within a week, leaving UNITY with a critical manpower shortage. They are forced to send UNITY agent Cate Archer and her mentor, Bruno Lawrie, on a series of high-profile missions. Cate is an ex-, and is UNITY's first female spy operative. UNITY's leaders, Jones and Smith, are skeptical of Cate working as a field agent, and have previously relegated her to more mundane assignments. Intelligence reveals that a Russian assassin named Dmitrij Volkov and a new terrorist organization named H.A.R.M. are responsible for the murders of UNITY's former agents. Cate and Bruno embark on a dangerous assignment in Morocco, which later turns out to be an ambush set up by Volkov and his men. Cate manages to escape Morocco whilst Bruno is shot by Volkov. In the UNITY headquarters, Jones and Smith reveal that Volkov killed Bruno simply because he was the traitor, to which Cate reacts with disbelief.|$|E

25|$|As a {{response}} to sexual coercion and the costs that females face, one of their counter-adaptations is the evolution of anatomical protection. Females of some species, such as the water striders, developed morphological shields to protect their genitalia from males <b>that</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> forcefully copulate. Some Gerridae females have also evolved abdominal spines and altered the shapes of their abdomens to make them less accessible to males.|$|E
25|$|This {{is common}} with {{companies}} <b>that</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> retain brand recognition while {{moving away from}} an outdated image: American Telephone and Telegraph became AT, Kentucky Fried Chicken became KFC to de-emphasize the role of frying {{in the preparation of}} its signature dishes, and British Petroleum became BP. Russia Today has rebranded itself as RT. Genzyme Transgenics Corporation became GTC Biotherapeutics, Inc. in order to reduce perceived corporate risk of sabotage/vandalism by Luddite activists.|$|E

25|$|In 2007 the INAO, the {{government}} organization that controls wine appellations in France, {{was preparing to}} make the largest revision of the region's legal boundaries since 1927, in response to economic pressures. With soaring demand and limited production of grapes, Champagne houses say the rising price could produce a consumer backlash that would harm the industry for years into the future. That, along with political pressure from villages <b>that</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{be included in the}} expanded boundaries, led to the move. Changes are subject to significant scientific review and are said to not impact Champagne produced grapes until 2020.|$|E

On 13 February 2016, however, the head of Guerrero's State Civil Registry department announced that same-sex couples could marry in any of the jurisdictions <b>that</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> marry the couples and criticised Acapulco's Civil Registry and other civil registries throughout the state for not allowing these kinds of weddings.|$|E
25|$|Applications {{communicate}} with the audio driver through Sessions, and these Sessions are programmed through the Windows Audio Session API (WASAPI). In general, WASAPI operates in two modes. In exclusive mode (also called DMA mode), unmixed audio streams are rendered directly to the audio adapter and no other application's audio will play and signal processing has no effect. Exclusive mode is useful for applications that demand {{the least amount of}} intermediate processing of the audio data or those <b>that</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> output compressed audio data such as Dolby Digital, DTS or WMA Pro over S/PDIF. WASAPI exclusive mode is similar to kernel streaming in function, but no kernel mode programming is required. In shared mode, audio streams are rendered by the application and optionally applied per-stream audio effects known as Local Effects (LFX) (such as per-session volume control). Then the streams are mixed by the global audio engine, where a set of global audio effects (GFX) may be applied. Finally, they're rendered on the audio device.|$|E

All of those things are crippling your life, and we can see in that audition that the anxiety that came out of the fear of feeling your anger actually stopped you getting that job, which you’d held for 3  years, so it’s a very destructive system [Again pointing out and clarifying the system of defences used to defend against hostile, angry feelings and the self-destructive consequences of such a system].|$|R

Newell stated that getting Steam and games to work on Linux is a key strategy for Valve; Newell called the closed nature of Microsoft Windows 8, [...] "a catastrophe {{for everyone in the}} PC space", and that Linux would maintain [...] "the openness of the platform".
