And I <b>thought,</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1983, on her {{way back}} from Paris, Steinberg began dancing in the studio of Moses Pendleton, who had founded the modern dance company Pilobolus. She had been {{attracted}} to Pilobolus growing up: [...] "I was taller than most girls my age, and I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> company I could be with because the women were always lifting the men." [...] There she joined up with Daniel Ezralow, Jamey Hampton, and Ashley Roland, and the four created the Connecticut-based, dancer-illusionist company MOMIX. From 1983 to 1986, Steinberg toured nationally with MOMIX. The group became known for their visual humour, contorted positions, and Trompe-l'œil effects.|$|E
500|$|Talk of {{a canopy}} or halo {{to protect the}} driver was {{accelerated}} by the fatal Formula One accident that killed Jules Bianchi in October 2014 and an incident where Justin Wilson was fatally struck {{in the head by}} debris during an IndyCar race in August 2015. In particular, following Wilson's death, Allmendinger stated that he would [...] "never again" [...] run open-wheel cars, adding [...] "The only way I would do it is if they put in a closed cockpit over the car and tested it and they <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good direction in safety then I might think about doing it again." [...] As a result, several major open-wheel series have implemented cockpit protection systems, with Formula One, Formula Two, and Formula Three all planning to introduce the halo for the 2018 motorsport season.|$|E

500|$|Gittings {{began to}} {{hitchhike}} on weekends to New York City, {{dressed as a}} man, to visit gay bars since she knew of none in Philadelphia, and knew of no other places to go to get [...] "plugged into the gay community." [...] In a 1975 interview, she recalled, [...] "I wore drag because I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> way to show I was gay. It's changed now, {{but in the early}} 50s there were basically two types of women in the gay bars: the so-called butch ones in short hair and plain masculine attire and the so-called femme ones in dresses and high heels and makeup. I knew high heels and makeup weren't my personal style, so I thought...I must be the other kind!" [...] However, Gittings found very little in common with the women she met in the bars, and after witnessing a gay male acquaintance get beaten up after leaving a bar, began to focus her energies on collecting books.|$|E
500|$|Although Kidd {{drove his}} dancers hard, {{partly because he}} himself was capable of doing all the dance steps that he {{required}} of them, his personal style was gentle. Nanette Fabray, who performed in Love Life, could only make dancing turns {{to the left side}} because of a hearing problem. Rather than insisting she turn to the right, as many choreographers would do, Kidd [...] "found that fascinating, and he made all the other dancers turn to the left". Julie Andrews recalled that the [...] "Burlington Bertie From Bow" [...] number in Star! was physically demanding, and she balked when Kidd asked her for a retake, saying she had a bad back. Andrews recalled that [...] "he looked crestfallen. Then he said, 'I wasn't trying to be mean. I just knew that when you saw it on film, you wouldn't be pleased.' I always <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> nice way to say, 'Once more.|$|E

The song {{is similar to}} the original recording of the song with the only noticeable change being that Kesha now sings the song's first verse. While being interviewed by Digital Spy Cruz explained how the cover initially came about and his view on the cover, [...] "she asked me if she could do a version of the song where she sang the first verse and I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> really cool idea. I really like both versions, and it's good that there are these two different versions out there, because fans of me get more of me on mine and [...] fans get more of her on hers." ...|$|E

Benioff stated, [...] "We had this meeting with George Martin where we're trying {{to get as much}} information as possible out of him, and probably the most shocking revelation he had for us was when he told us the origin of Hodor and how that name came about. I just remember Dan and I looking at each other when he said that and just being like, 'Holy shit.'" [...] Weiss continued, [...] "It {{was just one of the}} saddest and most affecting things. Even sitting in a hotel room having someone tell you this was going to happen in the abstract in some way and that 'hold the door' was the origin of the name Hodor, we just <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> really, really heart-breaking idea." ...|$|E

Masood is still {{the only person who}} can see Yusef for what he really is, so he goes into a blind panic over the situation. Masood calls in the police, and they make sure that Kamil is safe, but we're left to wonder if he will stay that way. The police say that they can't get involved in domestic disputes, so Masood says, 'Well, what about the father's rights? If a mother reported this, you'd see it as kidnap'. I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> great line and really interesting - I think in that moment, Masood's representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don't have access to their children in the same way." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the qualities}} of The Basement Tapes that sets it apart from {{contemporaneous}} works is its simple, down-to-earth sound. The songs were recorded in mid-1967, the [...] "Summer of Love" [...] that produced The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, their most technically elaborate album. In a 1978 interview, Dylan reflected on the period: [...] "I didn't know how to record the way other people were recording, and I didn't want to. The Beatles had just released Sgt. Pepper which I didn't like at all. I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very indulgent album, though the songs on it were real good. I didn't think all that production was necessary." [...] Of the sound and atmosphere of the basement recordings, Barney Hoskyns wrote that [...] "Big Pink itself determined {{the nature of this}} homemade brew." [...] "One of the things is that if you played loud in the basement, it was really annoying, because it was a cement-walled room", recalled Robertson. [...] "So we played in a little huddle: if you couldn't hear the singing, you were playing too loud." ...|$|E

500|$|Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel {{grew up in}} the 1940s and 1950s in the {{predominantly}} Jewish neighborhood of Forest Hills in Queens, New York, just three blocks away from one another, and attended the same schools, Public School 164 in Flushing, Parsons Junior High School, and Forest Hills High School. Individually, when still young, they developed a fascination with music; both listened to the radio and were taken with rock and roll as it emerged, particularly the Everly Brothers. When Simon first noticed Garfunkel, he was singing in a fourth grade talent show, and Simon <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good way to attract girls; he hoped for a friendship which eventually started in 1953 when they were in the sixth grade and appeared on stage together in a school play adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. That first stage appearance was followed by the duo forming a street-corner doo-wop group, the Peptones, with three other friends, and learning to harmonize together. [...] They began performing {{for the first time as}} a duo at school dances.|$|E
500|$|After {{releasing}} the successful debut album Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip (1992), TLC {{began working on}} the their second release called CrazySexyCool in late 1993 and continued through till September 1994. One of the album's tracks, [...] "Creep", was based on member Tionne [...] "T-Boz" [...] Watkins' own experience. She recalled it for Billboard: [...] "You're with a guy and he's not showing you attention, so another guy comes along and you're like, 'Hey, if you were where {{you were supposed to}} be, he couldn't be showing me attention right now!' I {{was in the middle of}} this drama, because the other guy was [...] friend, and my boyfriend was just not getting it together." [...] Watkins then shared this to the group's long-time writer-producer Dallas Austin, who she had known and with whom she had shared many stories since the two were teenagers. [...] "We <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good relationship to talk about because a lot of people don't admit that's how they feel – that their man's playing on them and they want to be with him so they seek attention elsewhere, but they really want to be with their guy," [...] she added.|$|E

[...] Basile criticized its characters especially the use of foam to create the characters and the way Santa Claus was depicted saying [...] "...he looks like a pig with liver spots." [...] The animators responded to this comment about their interpretation of Santa Claus, saying [...] "We definitely wanted to keep an element of strangeness, almost scary aspects in the story." [...] Caballero explained that the idea of making Santa Claus look tired and strange came when they saw a drawing of him by Marc Ceccarelli or Luke Brookshier. Caballero said, [...] "We <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> great idea. So we came up with our own little back story where Bikini Bottom is the last stop for Santa. He's tired, he wants to get home, take his shoes off ... We honed in on the old descriptions of Santa being a jolly old elf. We pictured him as humanoid, but not necessarily directly human." ...|$|E
