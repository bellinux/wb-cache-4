5|$|The armies {{remained}} in their encampments {{for the campaign}} season while men and horses ate all the provisions and forage for miles. Prince Henry wrote to his brother, suggesting they complete their operations by 22 August, at which time he estimated he would have exhausted local supplies of food for his men and fodder for his horses. Frederick agreed. He laid plans to cross the Elbe and approach the Austrian force from the rear, but <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>he</b> examined the conditions of Joseph's entrenchments, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>he</b> realized the campaign was already lost. Even if he and Henry executed simultaneous attacks on the Königgrätz heights, such a plan exposed Henry to a flanking attack from Laudon. A coordinated frontal and rear assault was also unlikely to succeed. Even if it did, the Prussian losses would be unacceptable and would demolish his army's capacity to resist other invaders. From Frederick's perspective, the Russians and the Swedes were always ready {{to take advantage of}} any perceived Prussian weakness, and the French also could not be trusted to keep their distance. For Frederick, it was a risk not worth taking. Despite this realization, the four armies—two Austrian, two Prussian—{{remained in}} place until September, eating as much of the country's resources as they could.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{season for the}} Central American squirrel monkey is in September. All females come into estrus at virtually the same time. A month or two before the {{breeding season}} begins, males become larger. This is not due to extra muscle, but to altered water balance within the male's body. This is caused by conversion of the male hormone testosterone into estrogen; thus the more testosterone a male produces, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>he</b> grows {{in advance of the}} breeding season. Since males within a group have not been observed fighting over access to females during breeding season, nor attempting to force females to copulate with them, it is believed that female choice determines which males get to breed with females. Females tend to prefer the males that expand the most in advance of breeding season. This may be because the most enlarged males are generally the oldest and the most effective at detecting predators, or it may be a case of runaway intersexual selection.|$|E

25|$|Carpenter is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} founders of the modern theory of the adaptive unconscious. Together with William Hamilton and Thomas Laycock they provided the foundations on which adaptive unconscious is based today. They observed that the human perceptual system almost completely operates outside of conscious awareness. These same observations have been made by Hermann Helmholtz. Because these views were in conflict with the theories of Descartes, they were largely neglected, until the cognitive revolution of the 1950s. In 1874 Carpenter noticed that <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>he</b> studied the mechanism of thought, the more clear it became that it operates largely outside awareness. He noticed that the unconscious prejudices can be stronger than conscious thought and that they are more dangerous since they happen outside of conscious.|$|E

However the Danish Bishop Anders Sunesen {{on top of a}} hill {{overlooking}} the battle prayed to God with his arms raised, which meant that the Danes moved closer to victory <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>he</b> prayed. When he raised his arms the Danes surged forward and when his arms grew tired and he let them fall, the Estonians turned the Danes back. Attendants rushed forward to raise his arms once again and the Danes surged forward again. At a second he was so tired in his arms that he dropped them and the Danes then lost the advantage and were moving closer to defeat. He needed two soldiers to keep his hands up and when the Danes were about to lose, 'Dannebrog' miraculously fell from the sky and the King took it, showed it to the troops and their hearts were filled with courage and the Danes won the battle.|$|E

Donald Pease notes that he worked on it primarily alone, unlike with previous books, which had been more collaborative efforts between Geisel and his wife, Helen. This marked a general trend in his work and life. As Robert L. Bernstein later said of that period, [...] "The more I saw of him, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>he</b> liked being in that room and creating all by himself." [...] Pease points to Helen's recovery from Guillain–Barré syndrome, which {{she was diagnosed with}} in 1954, as the marker for this change.|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{maintained}} {{an interest in}} harmonic experiments and continued exploring new idioms throughout his career. He tempered this interest with an abhorrence of excess and kept his tendency to experiment under constant control. The more radical his harmonies became, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>he</b> attempted to control them with strict rules—applying his [...] "musical conscience", as he called it. In this sense, he was both a progressive and a conservative composer. The whole tone and octatonic scales were both considered adventurous in the Western classical tradition, and Rimsky-Korsakov's use of them made his harmonies seem radical. Conversely, his care about how or when in a composition he used these scales made him seem conservative compared with later composers like Igor Stravinsky, though they were often building on Rimsky-Korsakov's work.|$|E

His parents decided to remove the [...] "i" [...] and call him [...] "Edson", {{but there was a}} mistake on the birth certificate, leading many documents to show his name as [...] "Edison", not [...] "Edson", as he is called.

"Can't Hold Us Down" [...] lyrically {{discusses}} feminism; {{the song}} criticizes [...] "common" [...] gender-related double standards, {{in which men}} are applauded for their sexual behaviors, while women who behave {{in a similar fashion}} are disdained. In the book Therapeutic Uses of Rap and Hip-Hop, Susan Hadley and George Yancy discuss that [...] "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] is a hip hop song that [...] "encourages young women to be proud, strong, and empowered to be all that they can be". At the song's first verse, Aguilera sings [...] "Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind / Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled"; she later rejects that all women [...] "should be seen, not heard" [...] and encourages them to [...] "shout louder" [...] during the chorus. Aguilera comments on the double standard with the lyrics [...] "The guy gets all the glory <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>he</b> can score / While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore".

500|$|During {{the past}} century, the fictitious diary has {{developed}} as an accepted means of comedic expression; the original has, says Morton, [...] "been fertile ground which has germinated many seeds". An early example is Anita Loos's novel of 1925: [...] {{in which the}} protagonist, Lorelei Lee, records her flirtatious adventure in prose that [...] "follows the mannerisms of colloquial speech" [...] and suggests innocence or ignorance yet, the critic Elyse Graham observes, [...] "burlesques, in excoriating detail, the vernacular of the American middle class". [...] The diary genre became particularly popular in the late 20th century. In 1978–81 Christopher Matthew produced three volumes of diaries recording the daily life of [...] "Simon Crisp", a bachelor would-be man-about town of the era. The title of the first, The Diary of a Somebody, is a direct reference to the Grossmith original. Reviewing this volume in The Spectator, Benny Green points out several parallels with the original, in both character and event. Matthew's book, says Green, is amusing, but the Grossmiths' book is superior; it is [...] "affecting as well as comical, {{in a way that}} the Matthew pastiche is not". In 1982 came the first appearance of Sue Townsend's teenage creation, Adrian Mole, whose passage into young manhood and early middle age is charted in a long series of diaries. The more middle-aged he becomes, says Morton, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>he</b> resembles Pooter.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Popular Culture in Counseling, Psychotherapy, and Play-Based Interventions, Lawrence Rubin {{states that}} while Naruto has an optimistic and hyperactive personality, the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox (Kurama) within his body symbolizes his {{negative}} emotions. He comments that Naruto has a [...] attitude {{when dealing with}} intense conflicts and emotions. He also states that Naruto would use Kurama's chakra for battles he can not handle with his own chakra. Rubin further notes that the more Naruto uses Kurama's chakra, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>he</b> puts his comrades and himself in danger. Rubin feels the reason Naruto is a troublemaker is because some villagers avoid him and others mistreat him. He states that children {{growing up in the}} real world who have development issues can relate to his character. Rubin states that the search for acceptance, and being acknowledged by his peers is what motivates Naruto to keep going until he reaches his life's goal, becoming the Hokage. Rubin feels that Naruto's fights with enemies who try to bring harm to the Leaf Village further motivate him to become a powerful shinobi, and a [...] "complete and mature person". Rubin concludes that Naruto's character development {{is similar to that of}} a modern American hero, the type who accidentally becomes better during a series and is able to build or restore peace.|$|E
500|$|... "Sleepers" [...] was {{developed}} because the producers {{wanted to do}} a Tesla-centric episode, as they view him as one of their favorite characters. [...] "Haunted" [...] rounds Druitt to [...] "something unexpected." [...] The producers were aware that Druitt became more insane <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>he</b> teleports, and they wanted to find an explanation why, hence the creation of the energy creature. [...] "Kali" [...] was designed as a somewhat [...] "faith versus science" [...] episode, with faith as the winning party, because any host to the macri would need a spiritual understanding to it; the cult of Kali are religious, so they would make suitable hosts, but Edward Forsythe is a believer of science, and would not make a suitable host as he does not share the cult's understanding. In the original draft, Magnus would fall ill, but that later changed to Will before the episode was filmed. Some episodes in the season originally followed a different order. [...] "Pavor Nocturnus" [...] was originally going to be the fourth episode, while [...] "Hero" [...] would become the tenth. [...] "Sleepers" [...] would also be in an earlier slot. However, the order changed, partially due to availability issues with Jonathon Young for [...] "Sleepers". The writers were also working on a Bigfoot-centric episode, where he returns to his home.
