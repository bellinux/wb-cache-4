5|$|Motor <b>transport</b> <b>units</b> {{were also}} formed. Not {{required}} at Gallipoli, {{they were sent}} on to the Western Front, becoming the first units of the AIF to serve there. The motor transport rejoined I ANZAC Corps when it reached the Western Front in 1916. Australia also formed six railway operating companies, which served on the Western Front. Specialist ordnance units included ammunition and mobile workshops units formed late in the war, while service units included supply columns, ammunition sub-parks, field bakeries and butcheries, and depot units. Hospitals and other specialist medical and dental units were also formed in Australia and overseas, as {{were a number of}} convalescent depots.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1946, McAloney was {{involved}} in an investigation {{into a series of}} engine failures experienced by RAAF aircraft. The inquiry led him to visit operational and <b>transport</b> <b>units</b> throughout Australia, in an attempt to determine whether the issues were the result of substandard maintenance or defective components. He returned to his duties at the Directorate of Technical Services on the investigation's conclusion. Made squadron leader in March 1950, he attended a land/air warfare course the following year. McAloney was posted to Singapore in June 1952 as the technical officer to the Changi-based No.90 (Composite) Wing, formed specifically for service in the Malayan Emergency. The attachment proved short lived with the disbandment of No.90 Wing in December, at which point McAloney transferred to No.1 Squadron, then operating out of Tengah.|$|E

5|$|During the Gallipoli Campaign four {{light horse}} brigades had been {{dismounted}} and fought alongside the infantry divisions. However, in March 1916 the ANZAC Mounted Division {{was formed in}} Egypt (so named because it contained one mounted brigade from New Zealand). Likewise, the Australian Mounted Division—formed in February 1917—was originally named the Imperial Mounted Division because it contained the British 5th and 6th Mounted Brigades. Each division consisted of three mounted light horse brigades, each of which consisted of three regiments. Following {{the expansion of the}} Desert Column in August 1917 these divisions formed part of the Desert Mounted Corps, which consisted of the ANZAC Mounted Division, Australian Mounted Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade (which included a number of Australian, British and New Zealand camel companies). The AIF also included the Australian Flying Corps (AFC), which consisted of four operational squadrons—Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4, and four training squadrons—Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8. More than 2,000 women served with the AIF, mainly in the Australian Army Nursing Service. In addition, a number of other specialist units were also raised, including tunnelling companies, motor <b>transport</b> <b>units,</b> railway, ordnance, workshops and service units, and hospitals and other specialist medical and dental units. One small armoured unit was also raised.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally the Australian Army had {{relied on}} its major allies to provide {{logistic}} support, primarily raising combat units rather than support arms {{during times of}} conflict. Consequently, these services were relatively underdeveloped, and they remained so during {{the first years of}} the war. While British units provided many logistic and line of communication services for the AIF in North Africa during the early campaigns in 1940 and 1941, the Army needed to raise extensive support units to support its combat formations in the Pacific following the Japanese entry into the war. As a result, the growth of the support arms and ancillary services proved dramatic, including many capabilities which the Australian Army had only minimal or no previous experience in maintaining. These units included terminal formations and beach groups responsible for loading and unloading ships, food and petroleum storage and distribution units and several farm units which grew food for troops in remote areas. In addition, with Australia's national support base located well to the rear, in the major cities in the south-east of the country, significant expansion of the Army's transport capabilities was required to move supplies and men to the field force based in northern Australia and New Guinea. Many road <b>transport</b> <b>units</b> were raised to move supplies around Australia, while the Royal Australian Engineers eventually operated a fleet of 1,900 watercraft and three air maintenance companies were formed to load supply aircraft.|$|E

The Japanese had also lost almost every one of the 12,000 pack horses and mules in their <b>transport</b> <b>units</b> and the 30,000 cattle used either as beasts of burden or as rations. The loss of pack animals was to cripple several of their divisions during the following year.|$|E

The divisional artillery consisted of three field artillery regiments with twenty-four 25-pounder guns each, one anti-tank regiment with forty-eight anti-tank guns and one light anti-aircraft regiment with up to fifty-four light anti-aircraft guns. There were three engineer field companies and one engineer field park company, plus signals, medical and <b>transport</b> <b>units.</b>|$|E

25|$|On 24 February Carey flew {{a ground}} attack {{airfield}} at the Japanese-held airfield Raheng. Carey claimed a Ki-27 and an unidentified transport shot down {{as they took}} off. Japanese records show only one Ki-27 {{and it is not}} certain any Japanese <b>transport</b> <b>units</b> were based there. They may have been a Mitsubishi Ki-57 or possibly a Nakajima Ki-34. Carey's last victory for some months was achieved on 26 February 1942. Carey shot down a Nakajima Ki-43, one of several making a landing circuit over Moulmein. In this action Carey was saved by his wingman Glop Underwood who shot down a Ki-43 as it closed on him. Underwood was then shot down and captured. The Japanese fighters were from the 50th and 77th Sentai which recorded the loss of one and four damaged. Losses for the 77th are unknown. The American units claimed two on the ground and 11 in the air. Carey claimed three enemy aircraft in the air and two on the ground which were either Ki-27s or Ki-43s.|$|E
25|$|Another {{tactical}} consideration led to operational innovation. Richthofen {{adopted the}} shuttle air tactic. In order to maximise support over the frontline, aircraft operated from bases {{near the front}} to keep and gain an advantage. It was very successful in the 1937 battles. Aircraft were sent in small formations to bomb frontline positions, while other groups of ground attack aircraft were en route and refuelling. This way a constant air presence was maintained over the battlefield which eroded the effectiveness and morale of the enemy. In order {{for this to be}} able to work effectively, three or more sorties needed to be flown per day. This required a large number of personnel to set up and man forward airfields. At the operational level, the Luftwaffes logistics units had to be completely motorised to bring in fuel, ammunition and spare parts. These units had the opportunity to be tested under tough operational conditions. The experience in Spain had shown air <b>transport</b> <b>units</b> were invaluable to logistics, and with Richthofen's input, were expanded accordingly. By 1939, the Luftwaffe would have the largest, and most capable transport service in the World.|$|E
25|$|Battlefield 2: Armored Fury is {{the second}} booster pack {{released}} for Battlefield 2 and was released on June 6, 2006. It added three new maps, {{as well as two}} new vehicle classes: attack jets for close air support and reconnaissance helicopters that operate as a mobile UAV. The booster pack has the USMC defending U.S. soil from invasions from the PLA and MEC. Operation Midnight Sun features the Chinese landing at the Alaskan port Valdez where they are trying to secure much needed fuel from the pipeline. Operation Road Rage is a MEC vs. USMC map, where the MEC are using US Highways to <b>transport</b> <b>units</b> to industrial areas. Operation Harvest sees the United States trying to stall the MEC en route to the capital from the northwest, being blocked in a Pennsylvania Dutch farm, while waiting for reinforcements. New vehicles include Attack or Close Air Support aircraft such as the A-10 Thunderbolt II, Su-39 and the Nanchang Q-5 as well as new light utility helicopters such as MH-6 Little Bird, EC-635 and the Z-11. As well as the addition of new helicopters and planes, DICE also added the Muscle Car and Semi Truck. However, the proposed AV-8B Harrier was cut from the add-on due to balancing issues.|$|E
