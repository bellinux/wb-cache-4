5|$|Aetosaur {{material}} was first described by Swiss paleontologist Louis Agassiz in 1844. He named the genus Stagonolepis from the Lossiemouth Sandstone in Elgin, Scotland, but considered {{it to be}} a Devonian fish rather than a Triassic reptile. This may be because he considered the strata <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Red Sandstone, and thus Paleozoic in age. Agassiz mistook the osteoderms for large rhomboidal scales, which he thought were arranged in a similar pattern to those of gars. He also thought that these supposed scales were very {{similar to those of the}} lobe-finned fish Megalichthys due to their large size.|$|E

Prior to the division's disbandment, the remaining men were visited by Edward Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII).|$|E

It is thought that the site was occupied into the era of Roman Britain, and the area continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wealden iron industry until its demise in the late eighteenth century.
