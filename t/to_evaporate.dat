5|$|Buckets {{began to}} be {{replaced}} with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam <b>to</b> <b>evaporate</b> sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.|$|E
5|$|Maple syrup is a syrup {{usually made}} from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple, or black maple trees, {{although}} {{it can also be}} made from other maple species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before the winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating <b>to</b> <b>evaporate</b> much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.|$|E

5|$|The uncatalyzed interconversion between para and ortho H2 {{increases}} with increasing temperature; thus rapidly condensed H2 contains {{large quantities of}} the high-energy ortho form that converts to the para form very slowly. The ortho/para ratio in condensed H2 is an important consideration in the preparation and storage of liquid hydrogen: the conversion from ortho to para is exothermic and produces enough heat <b>to</b> <b>evaporate</b> some of the hydrogen liquid, leading to loss of liquefied material. Catalysts for the ortho-para interconversion, such as ferric oxide, activated carbon, platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds, chromic oxide, or some nickel compounds, are used during hydrogen cooling.|$|E
5|$|When a pair {{of virtual}} {{particles}} (such as an electron and positron) is created {{in the vicinity of}} the event horizon, random spatial positioning might result in one of them to appear on the exterior; this process is called quantum tunnelling. The gravitational potential of the black hole can then supply the energy that transforms this virtual particle into a real particle, allowing it to radiate away into space. In exchange, the other member of the pair is given negative energy, which results in a net loss of mass-energy by the black hole. The rate of Hawking radiation increases with decreasing mass, eventually causing the black hole <b>to</b> <b>evaporate</b> away until, finally, it explodes.|$|E
5|$|The caliche was {{the main}} source of iodine in the 19th century and {{continues}} to be important today, replacing kelp (which is no longer an economically viable source), but in the late 20th century brines emerged as a comparable source. The Japanese Minami Kanto gas field east of Tokyo and the American Anadarko Basin gas field in northwest Oklahoma are the two largest such sources. The brine is hotter than 60°C from the depth of the source. The brine is first purified and acidified using sulfuric acid, then the iodide present is oxidised to iodine with chlorine. An iodine solution is produced, but is dilute and must be concentrated. Air is blown into the solution <b>to</b> <b>evaporate</b> the iodine, which is passed into an absorbing tower where sulfur dioxide reduces the iodine. The hydrogen iodide (HI) is reacted with chlorine to precipitate the iodine. After filtering and purification the iodine is packed.|$|E

5|$|Under certain {{circumstances}} the disk, which {{can now be}} called protoplanetary, may {{give birth to a}} planetary system. Protoplanetary disks have been observed around a very high fraction of stars in young star clusters. They exist from the beginning of a star's formation, but at the earliest stages are unobservable due to the opacity of the surrounding envelope. The disk of a Class0 protostar is thought to be massive and hot. It is an accretion disk, which feeds the central protostar. The temperature can easily exceed 400K inside 5AU and 1,000K inside 1AU. The heating of the disk is primarily caused by the viscous dissipation of turbulence in it and by the infall of the gas from the nebula. The high temperature in the inner disk causes most of the volatile material—water, organics, and some rocks <b>to</b> <b>evaporate,</b> leaving only the most refractory elements like iron. The ice can survive only in the outer part of the disk.|$|E
5|$|Once a droplet has frozen, {{it grows}} in the {{supersaturated}} environment, which is one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point. The droplet then grows by deposition of water molecules in the air (vapor) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets {{are so much more}} numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size {{at the expense of the}} water droplets. This process is known as the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the droplets <b>to</b> <b>evaporate,</b> meaning that the ice crystals grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground. Guinness World Records lists the world's largest (aggregate) snowflakes as those of January 1887 at Fort Keogh, Montana; allegedly one measured 15inches (38cm) wide. Although this report by a farmer is doubtful, aggregates of three or four inches width have been observed. Single crystals the size of a dime (17.91mm in diameter) have been observed. Snowflakes encapsulated in rime form balls known as graupel.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of pure alkali metals is somewhat complicated {{due to their}} extreme reactivity with commonly used substances, such as water. From their silicate ores, all the stable alkali metals may be obtained the same way: sulfuric acid is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and aluminium(III) ions from the ore (leaching), whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the hydroxide. The remaining insoluble alkali metal carbonate is then precipitated selectively; the salt is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid to produce the chloride. The result is then left <b>to</b> <b>evaporate</b> and the alkali metal can then be isolated. Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides, with calcium chloride typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture. The heavier alkali metals, however, is more typically isolated in a different way, where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and magnesium or calcium for the heaviest alkali metals) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride. The liquid or gaseous product (the alkali metal) then undergoes fractional distillation for purification.|$|E

5|$|Trujillo {{and colleagues}} have placed upper limits in Sedna's surface {{composition}} of 60% for methane ice and 70% for water ice. The presence of methane further supports {{the existence of}} tholins on Sedna's surface, because they are produced by irradiation of methane. Barucci and colleagues compared Sedna's spectrum with that of Triton and detected weak absorption bands belonging to methane and nitrogen ices. From these observations, they suggested the following model of the surface: 24% Triton-type tholins, 7% amorphous carbon, 10% nitrogen, 26% methanol, and 33% methane. The detection of methane and water ices was confirmed in 2006 by the Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared photometry. The presence of nitrogen on the surface suggests the possibility that, {{at least for a}} short time, Sedna may have a tenuous atmosphere. During a 200-year period near perihelion, the maximum temperature on Sedna should exceed , the transition temperature between alpha-phase solid N2 and the beta phase seen on Triton. At 38 K, the N2 vapor pressure would be 14 microbar (1.4 Pa or 0.000014 atm). However, its deep red spectral slope is indicative of high concentrations of organic material on its surface, and its weak methane absorption bands indicate that methane on Sedna's surface is ancient, rather than freshly deposited. This means that Sedna is too cold for methane <b>to</b> <b>evaporate</b> from its surface and then fall back as snow, which happens on Triton and probably on Pluto.|$|E
5|$|Merchants {{engaged in}} a {{multitude}} of private trades and industries. A single merchant often combined several trades to make greater profits, such as animal breeding, farming, manufacturing, trade, and money-lending. Some of the most profitable commodities sold during the Han were salt and iron, since a wealthy salt or iron distributor could own properties {{worth as much as}} ten million cash. In the early Western Han period, powerful merchants could muster a workforce of over a thousand peasants to work in salt mines and marshes <b>to</b> <b>evaporate</b> brine to make salt, or at ironworks sites where they operated bellows and casted iron implements. To curb the influence of such wealthy industrialists, Emperor Wu nationalized these industries by 117 BCE {{and for the first time}} drafted former merchants with technical know-how such as Sang Hongyang (d. 80 BCE) to head these government monopolies. However, by the Eastern Han period the central government abolished the state monopolies on salt and iron. Even before this, the state must have halted its employment of former merchants in the government salt and iron agencies, since an edict of 7 BCE restated the ban on merchants entering the bureaucracy. However, the usurper Wang Mang (r. 923 CE) did employ some merchants as low-level officials with a salary-rank of 600 bushels. Another profitable industry was brewing wine and liquor, which the state briefly monopolized from 98 to 81 BCE, yet relinquished its production to private merchants once again (with alcohol taxes reinstalled). The official Cui Shi (催寔) (d. 170 CE) started a brewery business to help pay for his father's costly funeral, an act which was heavily criticized by his fellow gentrymen who considered this sideline occupation a shameful one for any scholar. Cinnabar mining was also a very lucrative industry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article {{describes}} and evaluates an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) for a {{waste heat recovery}} system by both theoretical and experimental studies. Theoretical analysis of several working fluids shows that cycle efficiency is very sensitive <b>to</b> <b>evaporating</b> pressure, but insensitive to expander inlet temperature. Second law analysiswas carried out usingR 600 a as aworking fluid and a flow of hot air as a heat source, which is not isothermal, along the evaporator. The result discloses that the evaporator’s internal and external entropy generation is the main source of total entropy generation. The effect of the heat source temperature, evaporating pressure, and evaporator size on the entropy generation rate is also presented. The obtained useful power is directly linked to the total entropy generation rate according to the Gouy–Stodola theorem. The ORC testing systemwas established and operated using R 600 a as aworking fluid and hotwater as a heat source. Themaximum cycle efficiency of the testing system is 5. 2 per cent, and the testing result also proves that cycle efficiency is insensitive to heat source temperature, but sensitive <b>to</b> <b>evaporating</b> pressure. The entropy result also shows that internal and external entropy of the evaporator is the main source of total entropy generation...|$|R
