5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>song</b> {{came on and}} I {{just stood}} up and I kind of walked {{into the other room}} as if I was in a tractor beam and stood there in front of the stereo. It was just as {{powerful}} as the electric stuff, and it was songs I'd grown up singing. All of a sudden I'd found my music.|$|E
5|$|Before, Beyoncé's {{approach}} to heartbreak was always literal, {{her voice and}} her words declaiming her feelings with a studied earnestness that at times was difficult to believe, let alone connect with. 'Irreplaceable' is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>song</b> in which Beyoncé lies to herself, and the way her voice perfectly betrays that lie (revealing a giveaway tremble in the stiff upper lip of the lyrics) simultaneously renders it her most sophisticated and her most honest performance to date.|$|E

5|$|Madonna {{has only}} {{performed}} this song live once, on The Virgin Tour in 1985. It was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>song</b> {{of the second}} act of the show. Madonna wore a black, fringed micro-top and similar skirt, with her belly-button exposed, {{and a number of}} crucifixes in different sizes, hanging from different parts of her body. As the guitar intro of the song started, Madonna appeared on the side-stage and started dancing energetically, while flashlights fell on her. While singing the song, she sometimes opened her jacket and sometimes straddled the steel structure present on the stage. The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main stage. It was included on the video release, titled , which was shot in Detroit.|$|E
5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>song</b> that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E
5|$|When the Song dynasty was founded, the {{political}} elites consisted of officials (and their sons) {{who had served}} in the Five Dynasties era, {{as well as those who}} came from prominent families which boasted an aristocratic ancestry and had provided officials for generations. Since <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Song</b> emperors wished to avoid domination of government by military strongmen such as the jiedushi of the previous era, they limited the power of military officers and focused on building a powerful civilian establishment. During the 11th century, the expansion of schools and local academies nurtured a nationwide gentry class which provided most if not all officials. By the late 11th century, the elite marriage strategies of prominent families eroded due to the intense partisan politics surrounding the New Policies (新法; xin fa) of Chancellor Wang Anshi (1021–1086). These great families were replaced by officials representing diverse local gentry lineages throughout the country.|$|E
