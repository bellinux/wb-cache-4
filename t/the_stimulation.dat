The use of the literacy package for <b>the</b> literacy <b>stimulation</b> of <b>the</b> preschool-age children in this research would be discovered using the methods of interview, observation, and daily notes by finding information related to the mothers’s knowledge in <b>the</b> literacy <b>stimulation,</b> <b>the</b> mothers’ perception on <b>the</b> literacy <b>stimulation</b> package, <b>the</b> way of using <b>the</b> literacy <b>stimulation</b> package, obstacles faced during the use of <b>the</b> literacy <b>stimulation</b> package, they way to solve the obstacles during the use of <b>the</b> literacy <b>stimulation</b> package, and <b>the</b> results reached from the use of <b>the</b> literacy <b>stimulation</b> package.

Through the package that had been given, the Informants still felt difficult that was in inviting the children to concentrate and focus on the package they learned together, and the children preferred playing or watching television. The difficulties were solved by the Informants by following everything the children wanted to do and after that, the children were invited to learn again. keywords: The use of <b>the</b> literacy <b>stimulation</b> package, Preschool-Age Childre...|$|R

In this study, the role of GABAAreceptors on post-ictal depression period was investigated in amygdala kindling model of epilepsy inrat.
