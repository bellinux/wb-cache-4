5|$|Leonard (Johnny Galecki), Sheldon, Raj (Kunal Nayyar) and Howard (Simon Helberg) are in Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, {{waiting for}} Comic-Con tickets {{to go on}} sale online. After ten minutes of trying, Leonard finally gets in the queue but is 15,211th in line. Tickets run out and the four men are {{disappointed}} that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to attend, especially as they had {{spent so much time}} on their costumes, intending to go as different versions of the Hulk as portrayed by Lou Ferrigno, Eric Bana, Edward Norton, and Mark Ruffalo.|$|E
5|$|Continuing north, {{they soon}} {{run out of}} gas, but receive help from the Aurora Boreanaz, who instructs them to stay at a nearby cabin. The two survive {{the night in the}} cabin and set out on foot the next morning. They finally make it to Santa's workshop, only to find a dark, gloomy factory in a dreary, polluted, lifeless wasteland; Santa a sickly and {{depressed}} old man, the elves all horribly mutated and inbred due to Santa's attempts {{to keep up with the}} increasing gift demands year after year, and the reindeer carnivorous, feral monsters that eat the elves who wander out into the snow to die of exhaustion. Santa suddenly collapses and is too sick to deliver the presents. Brian and Stewie agree to do it, but end up wasting an hour and a half at their first house after the family discover their presence, before discovering they were in the wrong house. Realizing that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to complete the delivery in time, and understanding firsthand the impossibility of Santa's job, Stewie and Brian abandon the delivery in lieu of another plan.|$|E

25|$|Astrophysicist Sten Odenwald {{stated that}} the basic problem is that through {{intensive}} studies of thousands of detected exoplanets, most of the closest destinations within 50 light years do not yield Earth-like planets in the star's habitable zones. Given the multi-trillion-dollar expense {{of some of the}} proposed technologies, travelers will have to spend up to 200 years traveling at 20% the speed of light to reach the best known destinations. Moreover, once the travelers arrive at their destination (by any means), <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to travel down {{to the surface of the}} target world and set up a colony unless the atmosphere is non-lethal. The prospect of making such a journey, only to spend the rest of the colony's life inside a sealed habitat and venturing outside in a spacesuit, may eliminate many prospective targets from the list.|$|E

Though Kirk's crew detects the activation of Genesis and attempts {{to move out of}} range, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to escape the nebula in time due to the ship's damaged warp drive. Spock goes to the engine room to restore the warp drive. When McCoy tries to prevent Spock's entry, as exposure to the high levels of radiation would be fatal, Spock incapacitates the doctor with a Vulcan nerve pinch and performs a mind meld, telling him to [...] "remember". Spock successfully restores power to the warp drive and the Enterprise escapes the explosion, though at the cost of Spock's life. The explosion of Genesis causes the gas in the nebula to reform into a new planet, capable of sustaining life.|$|E

[...] Additionally, the ministry's commentary on the 1999 curriculum guideline for elementary schools note that [...] "given the advance of internationalization, along with fostering patriotism and awareness of being Japanese, it is important to nurture school children's respectful attitude toward the flag of Japan and Kimigayo as they grow up to be respected Japanese citizens in an internationalized society."

500|$|The {{canvassing}} {{is largely}} unsuccessful. [...] Most of {{the supporters of}} the park say <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to attend the meeting. [...] Mark, April and Tom speak with one seemingly interested resident, who is implied to be a pedophile. [...] Leslie becomes frustrated {{with the lack of}} success and attempts to push poll the community residents. [...] She suggests phrasing the question, [...] "Wouldn't you rather have a park than a storage facility for nuclear waste?" [...] Tom leaves the canvassing group to call prospective contractors about the park project, hinting at accepting bribes and making corrupt deals. [...] Several residents express a lack of support for the park. [...] Resident Kate Speevak (Lennon Parham) vows to attend the public meeting and voice her disapproval after a frustrated Leslie says, [...] "You don't care about your kids if you don't support this park". [...] The canvassing ends with an angry Leslie finding Mark and April playing Rock Band with Ann's boyfriend, Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) at Ann's house.|$|E
500|$|Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) assigns Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) to {{a social}} media project that meets with some success. She notices the two flirting {{with each other for}} the first time and assumes that she brought it on with the project, citing several unintentional double entendres in her project e-mails. She feels guilty because Erin is Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) girlfriend and Andy {{recommended}} Nellie to the adoption agency, and is afraid that Andy will fire her when he finds out. She hijacks Dwight's customer loyalty meeting to talk about fidelity in relationships, which soon zeroes in on Erin and Pete. Nellie also ends the social media project so <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to flirt. Shamed by Nellie's fidelity speech, Erin assumes a coldly professional attitude towards Pete. However, a talk with Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) reminds Nellie that Andy was not the best boyfriend to Erin and Nellie has second thoughts. She soon restarts the project, [...] "forcing" [...] Erin and Pete to work together again, much to their delight.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} assess an {{individual}} for agnosia, it must be verified that the individual is not suffering from a loss of sensation, and that both their language abilities and intelligence are intact. [...] In order for an individual to be diagnosed with agnosia, they must only be experiencing a sensory deficit in a single modality. [...] To make a diagnosis, the distinction between apperceptive and associative agnosia must be made. [...] This distinction {{can be made by}} having the individual complete copying and matching tasks. [...] If the individual is suffering from a form of apperceptive agnosia <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to match two stimuli that are identical in appearance. [...] In contrast, if an individual is suffering from a form of associative agnosia, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to match different examples of a stimulus. [...] For example, an individual who has been diagnosed with associative agnosia in the visual modality {{would not be able to}} match pictures of a laptop that is open with a laptop that is closed.|$|E

2500|$|These criticisms {{have been}} leveled by {{large and small}} {{manufacturers}} alike. According to 2002 business census data, 99% of the apparel manufacturers in the United States are small businesses, using the Small Business Administration's definition of [...] "less than 500 employees." [...] Many of them believe that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to manage or afford the mandated testing and will go out of business. This has resulted in an online petition campaign by small manufacturers of children's apparel.|$|E

If [...] any one says that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to give one-sixth of their means, the king don't use to compel them. If any one pays tax without any pending for about twelve years the King use to discount their tax for two years. The judgement from the king for the judicial cases of people will be accurate. He gives more importance for his people than for himself.|$|E
2500|$|Individual risk {{is lower}} in larger groups due to {{collective}} defense from predators, the dilution effect, and the selfish herd theory. All of these effects provide supplementary protection to {{individuals in the}} middle of the group. [...] To compensate for group conspicuousness, caterpillars minimize movement, reducing their chances of being located by invertebrate predators. This behavior has associated costs because it decreases individual caterpillars’ selectiveness regarding food sources, as <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to work to get better food sources. [...] Ontogenetic changes in caterpillars reduce the risk of predation and as a consequence, predation-related benefits of group foraging decrease with time. Moreover, grouping in later instars has the extra cost of an increased risk of pathogen transmission.|$|E
