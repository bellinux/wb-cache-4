5|$|By early February {{the program}} coding {{switched}} from legal pads to the PDP-10 and a preliminary version {{was completed by}} March 1975. Gates and Allen had {{been in contact with}} Roberts and MITS and the older looking Paul Allen would travel to Albuquerque in March. MITS needed more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a computer with 7k bytes of memory working, and they needed more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the software finished. When Allen arrived at MITS it took a day to get the software running; Allen remembers this being caused by computer memory problems while Roberts remembers the delay was due to software problems.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{kicked the}} game off, and also {{fashioned}} {{the first chance}} of the game; Ronaldo beat Lauren on the left wing to put over a cross, only for Scholes to head the ball over the crossbar after losing his marker. Two minutes later, a break from José Antonio Reyes had Carroll scampering across from his goal to meet the Spaniard, forcing Reyes wide enough to allow the United defence <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back.|$|E

It was released in January 1978 as the fourth single from the album Crystal. [...] "Ready for the <b>Times</b> <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> Better" [...] was Gayle's fourth {{number one on the}} U.S Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. The single stayed at number one for one week and spent a total of ten weeks on the chart.|$|R
5|$|Poor Luftwaffe {{administration}} {{meant the}} German defence took <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{the information from}} their radar sites. Major Harry von Bülow-Bothkamp—commanding II./JG 77—stated {{that it was the}} naval Freya, rather than Luftwaffe early warning sites that gave the alert. Owing to this, the RAF made landfall without interception. The first air-to-air shots were not traded until one hour after the Luftwaffe Freya made the initial report.|$|E

He had been in love with a young woman his age named Yui, but had sacrificed his memories of her and his loved ones for his magic.|$|E
5|$|Considering {{the weight}} of attack against airfields, hardly any fighters were {{destroyed}} on the ground. Figures indicated just two Spitfires and six Hurricanes were lost in this manner. The main reason for this was the high state of readiness of RAF units during daylight. The command depended on radar and the Observer Corps warning them in advance, giving them plenty of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> airborne. The successful strafing attack by Bf 109s of JG 52 on Manston depended {{on a combination of}} circumstances and chance which did not occur often during the battle.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the social}} circumstances, {{politically}} oriented social problem films ridiculed politicians and portrayed them as incompetent bumblers, scoundrels, and liars. In The Dark Horse (1932), Warren William is again enlisted, this <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an imbecile, who is accidentally {{in the running}} for Governor, elected. The candidate wins the election despite his incessant, embarrassing mishaps. Washington Merry-Go-Round portrayed the state of a political system stuck in neutral. Columbia Pictures nearly released the film with a scene of the public execution of a politician as the climax before deciding to cut it.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia was {{regarded}} as an ideal location for air training {{for a number of}} reasons. It was far from the hostilities, firmly pro-British and had excellent weather throughout the year. The British Air Ministry resolved to outsource training to the colony amid some urgency in late 1939 after EATS took a long <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> going in Canada. The RATG was the last EATS group to be formed, but the first to start training airmen; it also turned out fully qualified pilots before any of the others, doing so {{for the first time in}} November 1940.|$|E
5|$|The Scranton branch faces {{off against}} the {{corporate}} branch, commenting {{that they deserve}} to lose for deciding to close down Buffalo. The game is close, and Pam ends up injuring her ankle, although she wants to continue. Seeing an opportunity to remove Scranton's best player from the game, Charles insists that Pam take {{a seat on the}} grounds of her injury being a company liability. Determined to beat corporate, Jim takes Pam to a local hospital to get an X-ray while Dwight stalls the game to give them <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back. When the doctor calls Jim into the room for an update, the doctor informs Jim and Pam of some news that causes them to be ecstatic, presumably that Pam is pregnant.

Reviewers praised its visual {{style and}} considered the game as a whole to be an improvement from prior entries, but were critical of its controls, which some claimed took <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> used to, and its inconsistent difficulty. Sega released a sequel in 2009, Sonic and the Black Knight; the two form {{what is known as}} the Sonic Storybook series. Sonic and the Secret Rings was de-listed from retailers in 2010, following Sega's decision to remove all Sonic titles with sub-average Metacritic scores in order to increase the value of the brand.|$|E
5|$|By 11:04, Lindmayr's Dorniers {{had reached}} Calais. Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke, Park’s senior fighter controller, watched with the Prime Minister and Park as the Germans moved closer. De Broke {{had a problem}} of his own. He {{had no way of}} knowing which plots {{represented}} bombers and fighters. Bombers had to be intercepted, fighters could be ignored. The trick was to strike a balance and time the interception as well as possible. On one hand he must scramble early and allow enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into a favourable attack position; but on the other hand he had to avoid scrambling them too early lest the fighters run short of fuel before they met the enemy. Park joined de Broke. After a brief discussion he decided to commit several squadrons from RAF Biggin Hill. Park realised the raid could be a trap. Though the target seemed to be London, the aircraft, comprising 120–150 in number, may be an advanced guard of Bf 109s sent to clear the skies or disrupt fighter defences. Still, he gambled and sent nine squadrons into action at 11:15.|$|E
5|$|Despite an {{emergency}} appendectomy that delayed his spring training and shortened his <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{in shape for}} the season, Hershiser had been named NL Baseball Pitcher of the Month in April and {{a participant in the}} 1988 All-Star Game, getting outs against all three batters. In the eight games he started between July 10 and August 14, Hershiser had a 3–4 win–loss record with a 4.76 earned run average (ERA), raising his season ERA from 2.46 to 3.06. Following his August 14 start in which he left the game after two innings (his shortest appearance since 1985) with the Dodgers behind the Giants 8–2, he pitched complete games on August 19 (a shutout) and August 24. Prior to the game, Hershiser trailed teammate Tim Leary in shutouts, six to three, and Leary also combined with other pitchers to record a shutout that was not counted in his individual total.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} leg, on Friday, 2 May, at the seventh {{kilometre}} of the 18th stage, Corte–Taverna, Toivonen's Lancia {{went off the}} side of the road at a tight left corner with no guardrail. The car plunged down a ravine and crashed on its roof. The aluminium fuel tank underneath the driver's seat was ruptured by the trees and exploded. The fuel tank was not protected by a skid plate, an item used mainly on gravel rallies, which was not fitted for the all-asphalt Tour de Corse. The explosion happened within seconds of the crash, and Toivonen and his co-driver, Sergio Cresto would not have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out had they still been alive. The fire caused by the explosion was so intense that the Delta S4, built of fast-burning kevlar-reinforced plastic composite, was unidentifiable as a car afterwards. Both Toivonen and Cresto died in their seats. Toivonen left behind wife Erja (married in 1982) and two young children, son Markus and daughter Arla, while Cresto was single with no children.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{airborne}} assault on 20 May, the 2/7th became heavily engaged fighting German parachute troops around Canea. It then undertook a local counter-attack at 42nd Street {{during which the}} 2/7th launched a ferocious bayonet charge {{in concert with the}} New Zealand Maori Battalion that resulted in heavy German casualties. The 2/7th later covered the withdrawal to Sphakia where the Royal Navy attempted to evacuate the garrison by the sea, undertaking a three-day stand in the hills, before they were ordered down to the evacuation beaches. As Allied naval losses mounted the operation was called off before the 2/7th could embark. As a result, most of the battalion – over 400 personnel – was taken prisoner. Several 2/7th soldiers later escaped captivity; one of them, John Peck, became part of a Special Operations Executive team responsible for helping Allied prisoners of war escape. The battalion's commanding officer, Walker, was one of those captured, giving up his position on one of the last evacuation ships when it became apparent {{that the rest of the}} battalion would not have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> clear. Walker remained in captivity until the end of the war, along with many others of the battalion who went to prisoner of war camps in Greece, Germany, Austria and Poland.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war Woolley {{redirected}} the Commonwealth Observatory from solar research {{towards the}} study of stars and galaxies. It took <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the old and unused telescopes back up to working condition: they had to be overhauled and refurbished, and in one case rebuilt from scrap. Woolley got funding approval from the Prime Minister for construction of a 74-inch telescope, but it would not be finished for years. Gascoigne began to work in the nascent field of photoelectric photometry, using electrical devices to measure the brightness of stars more accurately than had been possible using photographic techniques. In 1951, with equipment brought by visiting astronomer Gerald Kron from California's Lick Observatory, he observed Cepheid variable stars, which are used to measure astronomical distances. Granted nine months of observing time on the Observatory's Reynolds 30-inch reflector telescope – an extraordinary opportunity – Gascoigne, Kron and others surveyed Cepheid stars in both the Small Magellanic Cloud and, later, the Large Magellanic Cloud. They also examined the colours of star clusters in the Small Cloud.|$|E

5|$|The {{task force}} left Hastings—{{approximately}} 15 minutes' flying {{time from the}} West Side Boys' camp—at approximately 06:15. Downstream from the villages—approximately 15 minutes' flying time, {{just out of the}} West Side Boys' visual and hearing range, the helicopters went into a holding pattern to allow the SAS observation teams <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into position to prevent the West Side Boys from attacking any of the captives before the extraction teams were on the ground. Once the observation teams were in position, the helicopters proceeded up the line of Rokel Creek, the Chinooks flying low enough that the downdraft tore off the corrugated iron roofs of several huts in the villages, including the roof of the building in which the Royal Irish were being held. As the helicopters approached, the SAS observation team at Gberi Bana engaged West Side Boys {{in the vicinity of the}} captives to prevent any gang members from attempting to kill them before the area was secured. Upon their arrival, the two Lynx attack helicopters strafed the villages to make the landing zones as safe as possible for the Chinooks and destroy the heavy weapons that had been identified by the SAS observation teams.|$|E
5|$|After {{the guests}} take their seats, Scott starts {{to worry that}} Charlene will not show up, but Paul and Mike assure him {{that she will be}} there. Reverend Sampson (Howard Bell) then invites {{everyone}} to stand as Charlene and Henry begin their walk up the aisle. Scott and Charlene exchange vows and Reverend Sampson pronounces them man and wife. At the reception, Jim tells Scott that he is proud of him and welcomes Charlene to the family. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) finds Madge crying in the kitchen and he comforts her. They are interrupted by Mrs. Mangel (Vivean Gray) who informs them that the telegrams from Max and Maria, Clive and Rosemary, who all are unable to attend, are being read out. Dan Ramsay (Syd Conabere) spots a mouse and tries to pick it up, but hits Mrs. Mangel's foot. She accuses Dan of groping her and as he protests his innocence, an argument breaks out among the guests. Scott and Charlene go to his bedroom and Gail brings them a gift from her father. Jane comes to tell Charlene that it is <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> changed for the honeymoon, while Paul takes their bags out to the car. Lucy tells Scott that she will miss him and he gives her his skateboard. Everyone gathers in the street to wave the couple off. Mrs. Mangel catches Charlene's bouquet, as the couple drive out of Ramsay Street.|$|E
5|$|Shooting on Edge of Darkness {{began on}} 9 July 1984 {{and ran for}} five months until 5 December 1984. Location filming took place in London (including the Barbican Arts Centre, BBC Television Centre and the Hilton International Kensington), Yorkshire (including the {{headquarters}} of the West Yorkshire Police in Bradford, the Middleton Railway, the headquarters of Systime Computers (now the O2 building) in Leeds where Craven hacks into the MI5 computer and at Westwood Cottage, Ilkley for Craven's home), Scotland (including the Gleneagles Hotel, where Jedburgh addresses the NATO conference and also where President Reagan's Reykjavík policy was formulated) and Wales (including Clogau Gold Mine and Manod, Blaenau Ffestiniog doubling as Northmoor with the hot cell a set constructed at a factory in Penygroes). Throughout the entire shoot, the production continued to be known as Magnox; the title Dark Forces was briefly considered before the serial was renamed Edge of Darkness in April 1985. As the shoot progressed it became apparent to the cast and crew that they had a potential hit on their hands; Bob Peck recalled, “I think we knew when we were making it {{that it was a good}} piece of work” while Kennedy Martin told reporters “I haven't had this feeling about something for 20 years. It's wonderful, after all this <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> something that actually works”.|$|E
