With non-wood pallets, a controlled coefficient of friction is often helpful to prevent the pallet from slipping from forks and racks. Stiffer pallets are more durable, and are handled more easily by automated equipment. If a pallet {{does not need to}} be lifted from all four sides, two-way pallets with unnotched stringers may be used, with the additional benefits of added rigidity and strength. Specifying <b>tolerances</b> <b>on</b> <b>flatness</b> and water content may help the supplier meet target requirements. Inspection of pallets, whether in person or by a third-party (such as [...] "SPEQ" [...] inspected pallets) offer additional assurance of quality.|$|R

40|$|In {{the cold}} strip rolling process, tension plays a great {{role in the}} {{stability}} of rolling, reduction of rolling force and power consumption, coordination of thickness control, and improvement of flatness quality. The correcting and attenuating effect of tension <b>on</b> <b>flatness</b> deviation is gradually revealed, but quantitative analysis of their inherent effect is still insufficient. Thus, a roll-strip-tension coupling model with both accuracy and efficiency was established to analyze the influence of tension <b>on</b> <b>flatness</b> deviation. In the model, a strip plastic deformation model based on a 3 -dimensional differential method was corrected by a strip transverse flow factor obtained by an finite element method simulation model and was consequently combined with a rolls elastic deformation model based on the influence function method and the tension calculation module. By the coupling model, the mechanism of the self-correction effect of front tension and the attenuation effect of back tension <b>on</b> <b>flatness</b> deviation was further discussed, and the calculation results of the corresponding correction coefficient and attenuation coefficient were obtained. The present paper brings more insight into the effect of tension <b>on</b> <b>flatness,</b> and lays a foundation for the optimization of the shape control model in the cold rolling process with tension...|$|R
