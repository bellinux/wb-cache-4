5|$|After finding all the Masters, <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> travels back to Dantooine and {{learns that}} the countless deaths at Malachor V {{resulted}} in <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> unconsciously giving up {{connection to the}} Force, which then became {{the teachings of the}} new Sith. If the player aided the Jedi Masters, they prepare to strip <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> of their Force connection permanently, as the Masters fear that these teachings could result in the actual death of the Force, but Kreia reveals herself to be the former leader of the Sith and murders them all in retribution. If the player killed the Jedi Masters, Kreia attacks <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> and leaves. Tracking Kreia to Telos, <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> fights and defeats a corrupted Atris, from whom it is learned that Kreia plans to strengthen a massive wound in the Force made ten years prior. This wound had been created by <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> during the Mandalorian Wars, when they activated a superweapon in order to end the battle on the planet Malachor V, causing mass death and destruction. Before following her to Malachor V, where Kreia had since rejoined the Sith as Darth Traya, <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> stops a Sith invasion of Telos, defeating one of Traya's former apprentices, the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus. On Malachor V, <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> is separated from their companions and fights through hordes of monsters on the planet's surface and the inhabitants of a large Sith Academy that survived the cataclysm. On the final floor of the academy, <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> kills the Sith Lord Darth Sion and confronts Darth Traya in the planet's core.|$|E
5|$|While hiding on the Harbinger, a Republic cruiser, <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> is sedated by HK-50, {{an assassin}} droid, to be {{delivered}} to a crime syndicate called the Exchange, who have put out a bounty on live Jedi. <b>The</b> <b>Exile</b> is rescued by Kreia, with whom they form a Force Bond, and the droid T3-M4 on the Ebon Hawk, and the three flee the Harbinger as it is hijacked by a squad of Sith assassins. However, their ship is damaged during escape by the Harbingers gunfire, and they eventually arrive at the Peragus Mining Facility. Teaming up with smuggler Atton Rand, the group escapes to the planet Telos IV. While hiding out on Telos, they encounter Atris, a surviving member of the Jedi Council who sentenced the protagonist to exile ten years prior. After settling a dispute regarding the Exile's past sentence, Atris forms an uneasy alliance with them, instructing them to seek out other surviving Jedi in order to rally against the Sith. <b>The</b> <b>Exile</b> then travels to four worlds to find reclusive Jedi Masters and either begs their aid or kills them in revenge for being exiled, depending on player choice. As <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> continues their journey, they are joined by several individuals in their quest.|$|E
5|$|After the {{destruction}} of the Second Temple and <b>the</b> <b>exile</b> of the majority of Jews from the land of Israel, Jewish cuisine continued to develop in the many countries where Jewish communities have existed since Late Antiquity, influenced by the economics, agriculture, and culinary traditions of those countries.|$|E

5000|$|Later, <b>the</b> <b>Exiles</b> visited Counter-Earth {{to save it}} from Proteus, {{in their}} {{teammate}} Morph's body. At first, Proteus convinced the Young Allies to fight <b>the</b> <b>Exiles.</b> <b>The</b> Young Allies later figured out the truth when Proteus was enjoying torturing <b>the</b> <b>Exiles.</b> Proteus seemed to be winning, but two cosmic entities known as [...] "O" [...] and [...] "K" [...] ripped Proteus away from <b>the</b> <b>Exiles,</b> saying that they've been waiting for him. They supplied Proteus with an army of nukes. Empress Dorma and Proteus soon clashed, resulting in Proteus taking Dorma's crown, drying up Atlantis, and killing her and her soldiers. <b>The</b> <b>Exiles</b> arrived with <b>the</b> Young Allies at Atlantis. Proteus then launched the nukes. Luckily, Colt and Jolt stopped the nukes without detonating them. Proteus had <b>the</b> <b>Exiles</b> and <b>the</b> Young Allies on the ropes when he put his crown back on. Unbeknownst to him, however, Blink rigged it with a behavior modifier- causing Proteus to believe he really is Morph and being trapped in Morph's body. <b>The</b> <b>Exiles</b> then teleported back to Panoptichron and sent the last remaining nukes into space. The Young Allies then thanked <b>the</b> <b>Exiles</b> for saving their world from the nukes, Dorma, and Proteus as they left.|$|R
5|$|Gaveston was not exiled immediately; he did {{not have}} to leave the realm until 25 June, but faced excommunication by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Winchelsey, should he return. Edward used the {{intervening}} period to provide for his favourite's continued prosperity and political importance. As a compensation for the loss of the earldom of Cornwall, which was another condition of <b>the</b> <b>exile,</b> Gaveston was granted land worth 3,000 marks annually in Gascony, and land amounting to the same value in England. Further to this, he was appointed the King's Lieutenant of Ireland, so that a certain amount of honour could be maintained despite the humiliation of <b>the</b> <b>exile.</b> The appointment came the day after Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, had been given the same position, indicating that it was an improvised measure. Gaveston's appointment came with wider authority than Ulster's, however, for he had full regal powers to appoint and dismiss any royal officers.|$|E
5|$|A {{great-granddaughter}} of Queen Victoria, {{she grew}} up in England, the German Empire, and the Mediterranean. She was congenitally deaf. After marrying Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark in 1903, she lived in Greece until <b>the</b> <b>exile</b> of most of the Greek royal family in 1917. On returning to Greece a few years later, her husband was blamed in part for the country's defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), and the family were once again forced into exile until the restoration of the Greek monarchy in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had given}} {{sanctuary}} to Tostig Godwinson when the Northumbrians drove him out, Malcolm was not {{directly involved in the}} ill-fated invasion of England by Harald Hardraade and Tostig in 1066, which ended in defeat and death at the battle of Stamford Bridge. In 1068, he granted asylum to a group of English exiles fleeing from William of Normandy, among them Agatha, widow of Edward the Confessor's nephew Edward <b>the</b> <b>Exile,</b> and her children: Edgar Ætheling and his sisters Margaret and Cristina. They were accompanied by Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria. The exiles were disappointed, however, if they had expected immediate assistance from the Scots.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> second <b>Exile</b> game follows {{directly}} from the first, released in November 1996.

5000|$|In certain seasons, exiled castaways {{receive a}} {{consolation}} prize: in all seasons with <b>Exile</b> Island, <b>the</b> <b>exiled</b> castaway receives {{a clue to}} the hidden immunity idol, {{which may or may not}} be located on the island. On Survivor: Gabon, <b>the</b> <b>exiled</b> castaway was given the option to give up their idol clue for [...] "instant comfort," [...] and in Survivor: Tocantins, <b>the</b> <b>exiled</b> castaway had <b>the</b> right to change tribes.

5|$|As the {{political}} conflict escalated into full-scale rebellion in 1321–22, Edmund {{played an important}} role in its suppression. The opposition stemmed from resentment against the king's new favourites, Hugh Despenser the Younger and Hugh Despenser the Elder. When Bartholomew Badlesmere, steward of the royal household, defected to the opposition, Edward made his youngest brother Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in place of Badlesmere on 16 June. In the parliament of July 1321, Edmund briefly sided with the opposition when he agreed to exile the Despensers, but later claimed this had been done under duress, and in November sat on the council that annulled <b>the</b> <b>exile.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ealdred (or Aldred; died 11 September 1069) was Abbot of Tavistock, Bishop of Worcester, and Archbishop of York in Anglo-Saxon England. He {{was related}} {{to a number of}} other ecclesiastics of the period. After {{becoming}} a monk at the monastery at Winchester, he was appointed Abbot of Tavistock Abbey in around 1027. In 1046 he was named to the Bishopric of Worcester. Ealdred, besides his episcopal duties, served Edward the Confessor, the King of England, as a diplomat and as a military leader. He worked to bring one of the king's relatives, Edward <b>the</b> <b>Exile,</b> back to England from Hungary to secure an heir for the childless king.|$|E
5|$|Edmund {{was born}} either in 1015, 1016 or 1017. Edmund's mother was {{probably}} Ealdgyth, Edmund Ironside's wife; {{it is possible}} that she was only his stepmother, as the king's death in November 1016 left space of only one year for two children to be born. Although {{there is a possibility that}} Edmund was older than his brother, later known as Edward <b>the</b> <b>Exile,</b> it is also possible that they were twins. At the time, it was customary for posthumous sons to bear their father's name; thus, Edmund could have been the younger, posthumous son.|$|E
50|$|Another {{alternate}} {{version of}} the Serpent Squad appeared in <b>Exiles</b> #89. <b>The</b> <b>Exiles</b> team had to restore Earth #27537. <b>The</b> <b>Exiles</b> {{had a hard time}} defeating the Squad, who were working together with Diamondback, but eventually <b>the</b> <b>Exiles</b> did manage to win and moved over to another reality.

5|$|In 1929 Kennan {{began his}} program on history, politics, culture, and the Russian {{language}} at the University of Berlin's Oriental Institute. In doing so, he would {{follow in the}} footsteps of his grandfather's younger cousin, George Kennan (1845–1924), a major 19th century expert on Imperial Russia and author of Siberia and <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> System, a well-received 1891 account of the Czarist prison system. During the course of his diplomatic career, Kennan would master a number of other languages, including German, French, Polish, Czech, Portuguese, and Norwegian.|$|E
5|$|In May 1919, upon {{receiving}} {{an invitation from}} fellow Jewish artist Marc Chagall, Lissitzky returned to Vitebsk to teach graphic arts, printing, and architecture at the newly formed People's Art School– a school that Chagall created after being appointed Commissioner of Artistic Affairs for Vitebsk in 1918. Lissitzky was engaged in designing and printing propaganda posters; later, he preferred to keep quiet about this period, probably because one of main subjects of these posters was <b>the</b> <b>exile</b> Leon Trotsky. The quantity of these posters is sufficient to regard them as a separate genre in the artist's output.|$|E
5|$|In the evening, {{after the}} ceremony, {{the royal family}} decided to leave their palace in Athens for Tatoi, but city {{residents}} opposed <b>the</b> <b>exile</b> of their sovereign and crowds formed outside the palace to prevent Constantine and his family from leaving. On 12 June, the former king and his family escaped undetected from their residence by feigning departure from one gate while exiting through another. At Tatoi, Constantine again impressed upon Alexander that he held the crown in trust only. It {{was the last time}} that Alexander would be in direct contact with his family. The next day, Constantine, Sophia and all of their children except Alexander arrived at the small port of Oropos and set off into exile.|$|E
50|$|When Proteus, the Exiles' archenemy, {{showed up}} one day, he tricked the Squadron Supreme into battling <b>the</b> <b>Exiles.</b> While <b>the</b> <b>Exiles</b> were distracted, Proteus fled to another reality. When Hyperion {{decided to join}} <b>the</b> <b>Exiles,</b> Power Princess stopped him, saying that Hyperion is needed in his own world. Power Princess then left with <b>the</b> <b>Exiles</b> to catch Proteus, despite the {{objections}} of Blink. However, under her guidance and direction, <b>the</b> <b>Exiles</b> came <b>the</b> closest they have ever been to beating Proteus. When she threw one of the blades of Longshot, she missed Proteus and hit the Maestro instead, setting him off. The Maestro fought <b>the</b> <b>Exiles,</b> and then Proteus fought Maestro. Proteus took the body of Morph and fled, despite Zarda's plan she considered foolproof. After finally defeating Proteus by trapping him in Morph's body, Power Princess remained an Exile to continue fixing damaged realities. She also suggested that Blink bury Mimic in his home reality. Otherwise Blink would have buried him in the desert of Panoptichron. Power Princess left the team {{to return to the}} Squadron Supreme, making her the first member to voluntarily quit <b>the</b> <b>Exiles.</b> She was replaced by Psylocke.|$|R
50|$|In 2002 <b>the</b> <b>Exiles</b> {{developed}} <b>the</b> player {{base with}} some valuable new additions {{that would prove}} key to <b>the</b> <b>Exiles</b> and <b>the</b> RLI Wolfhounds amateur team.

5|$|The Junta was {{rejected}} in Montevideo, as was <b>the</b> <b>exile</b> of Cisneros {{and the former}} Audiencia. Moreno reacted immediately, replying to the Montevidean concerns. He supported {{the legitimacy of the}} Primera Junta by criticizing the Regency Council and stating that the overseas Spanish territories were equally capable of creating Juntas, as it was debated during the open cabildo. He also called for unity and support of the metropolis, and that both cities recognize Ferdinand VII as their legitimate monarch. He argued that the Junta treated the exiles initially with moderation, but their obstinacy, particularly on the part of Cisneros, generated popular discontent. Matías Irigoyen told the same thing to the British Lord Strangford in Río de Janeiro.|$|E
5|$|Treaties between European {{settlers}} and the Dakota and Ojibwe gradually forced the natives off their lands {{and on to}} smaller reservations. In 1861, residents of Mankato formed the Knights of the Forest, with a goal of eliminating all Indians from Minnesota. As conditions deteriorated for the Dakota, tensions rose, leading to the Dakota War of 1862. The result of the six-week war was the execution of 38 Dakota and <b>the</b> <b>exile</b> {{of most of the}} rest of the Dakota to the Crow Creek Reservation in Dakota Territory. As many as 800 white settlers died during the war.|$|E
