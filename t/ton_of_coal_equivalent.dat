To evaluate the reduction potential of greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions of the industry in China, its emission inventory was calculated and scenario analysis was created for the period between 2012 and 2030 in this paper. Based on the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) model, the development of China’s road transportation industry in two scenarios (the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario and the comprehensive-mitigation (CM) scenario) was simulated. In the Comprehensive Mitigation scenario, there are nine various measures which include Fuel Economy Standards, Auto Emission Standards, Energy-saving Technology, Tax Policy, Eco-driving, Logistics Informatization, Vehicle Liquidation, Electric Vehicles, and Alternative Fuels. The cumulative energy and emission reductions of these specific measures were evaluated.

This study attempts to improve the understanding of uncertainties in China's energy statistics and evaluate their impacts on China's emissions {{during the period of}} 1990 – 2013. We employed the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) model to calculate China's emissions based on different official data sets of energy statistics using the same emission factors. We found that the apparent uncertainties (maximum discrepancy) in China's energy consumption increased from 2004 to 2012, reaching a maximum of 646  Mtce (million <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent)</b> in 2011 and that coal dominated these uncertainties. The discrepancies between the national and provincial energy statistics were reduced after the three economic censuses conducted during this period, and converging uncertainties were found in 2013. The emissions calculated from the provincial energy statistics are generally higher than those calculated from the national energy statistics, and the apparent uncertainty ratio (the ratio of the maximum discrepancy to the mean value) owing to energy uncertainties in 2012 took values of 30. 0, 16. 4, 7. 7, 9. 2 and 15. 6  %, for SO 2, NO x, VOC, PM 2. 5 and CO 2 emissions, respectively. SO 2 emissions are most sensitive to energy uncertainties because of the high contributions from industrial coal combustion. The calculated emission trends are also greatly affected by energy uncertainties – from 1996 to 2012, CO 2 and NO x emissions, respectively, increased by 191 and 197  % according to the provincial energy statistics but by only 145 and 139  % as determined from the original national energy statistics. The energy-induced emission uncertainties for some species such as SO 2 and NO x are comparable to total uncertainties of emissions as estimated by previous studies, indicating variations in energy consumption could be an important source of China's emission uncertainties. </p...|$|R

An analysis of the margins of uncertainty affecting nuclear power forecasts leads to the selection on a probable and a maximum estimate, on the basis of which uranium and enrichment requirements are derived and compared with present and potential sources of supply. Apart from its short- and long-term economic effects, the recent energy crisis, which witnessed a quadrupling of the price of crude oil in the major export areas and an induced increase in the prices of other conventional fuels, has sharply brought to the limelight the finiteness of energy resources, a concept which, though often proclaimed in the past, had been somewhat neglected during the heady days of rapid growth of energy consumption over the last two decades. While estimates of fossil fuel resources vary widely, they cover a general range of 1. 5 X 1012 to 15 X 1013 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent,</b> or, expressed in a somewhat more convenient unit, from 40 to 400 Q (where Q = 1018 BTU's = 250 X 1015 kcal), out <b>of</b> which <b>coal</b> represents by far the largest part. The present annual consumption of the world being of the order of 0. 28 Q it would at fist sight seem that the problem of exhaustion is not of immediate urgency. However, even if the rate of growth of energy consumption is reduced to 4 % from the 5 % of the last two decades, these reserves would be exhausted within 50 years if the lower estimate of 40 Q is accepted, and in about 100 years if the higher figure of 400 Q proves true. The developing of new sources of energy independent form fossil fuel is therefore essential. Among these, nuclear power based on fission is by far the leading contender. It would be entirely misleading to compare with these figures the amounts of energy which could be produced in power reactors of the present type from the low cost uranium resources at present proven and which are of the order of only 1 to 3 Q's.

This article aims to analyze the position and role, assess the resource availability, discuss the geographic distribution, market scale and industry development, and present the policy options of biomass in China. The resource availability and geographical distribution of biomass byproducts are assessed in terms of crop residues, manure, forest and wood biomass byproducts, municipal waste and wastewater. The position of biomass use for power generation is just next to hydropower among types of renewable energy in China. The potential quantity of all biomass byproducts energy in 2004 is 3511 Mtce (Mtce is the abbreviation <b>of</b> million <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> <b>equivalents</b> and 1 Mtce is equal to 10 (6) tce.), while the acquirable quantity is 460 Mtce. Biomass energy plays a critical role in rural regions of China. The geographical distribution and quantity of biomass byproducts resources depends mainly on the relationship between ecological zones and climate conditions. Our estimation shows that the total quantity of crop residues, manure, forest and wood biomass byproducts, municipal waste and wastewater resources are 728, 3926, 2175, 155 and 48240 Mt (million tons), respectively. Crop residues come mainly from the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Jilin and Sichuan. All manure is mainly located in the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Sichuan, Hebei and Hunan. Forest and wood biomass byproducts are mainly produced in the provinces or autonomous regions of Tibet, Sichuan, Yunnan, Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia, while most of municipal waste mainly comes from Guangdong, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Hubei and Jiangsu. Most of wastewater is largely discharged from advanced provinces like Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong and Henan. Biomass byproducts' energy distribution also varies from province to province in China. Based on the analysis of the market scale and industry development, the article argues that China's biomass energy industry is still at a very early stage of development and that Feed-in Tariffs (FIT) might be the best policy option for China to promote its development of biomass energy.

Without any energy and environmental policy measures, this tremendous economic growth {{would be associated with}} a quadrupling of primary energy consumption up to 6. 3 billion <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> standard <b>coal</b> <b>equivalents</b> (sce) and energy-related CO 2 -emissions of 13. 9 billion tons Against this background, this paper is to set China's need to implement its sustainable development strategy into the quantitative context of the countries economic development and subsequent economic growth-related environmental problems. China is urgently searching for a way to ease the negative implications of economic growth and has committed itself to achieve a level of 3. 0 billion ton sce primary energy consumption in 2020. As a consequence, the macro-economic energy intensity has to be reduced by 53 % by 2020. A reduction of 53 % by 2020 would lead to an energy intensity level 30 % points below the year- 2000 level of developed countries. As for natural resources, the expected economic growth will lead to an increase of crude oil net-imports up to 455 million ton sce in 2020 and 650 million ton sce in 2030. As for regional income distribution, economic growth helped to decrease existing inequities. Sustainable development Economic growth Resource saving...|$|R

Due to its rapid pace of urbanization and industrialization, China {{is one of}} the largest primary energy users in the world which accounts for approximately one-fifth of the global total primary energy supply (TPES) and one-fourth of carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, facing big challenges in environmental pollution. Therefore, this study chooses China as the jurisdiction within which to investigate the environmental implications of the construction sector because of its extremely high resource consumption and environmental burden. The primary aim of this research was to systematically quantify the direct and indirect energy transmissions embodied in China's construction sector at the regional and sectoral level, and develop a multi-regional hybrid framework for assessing embodied energy consumption at the project level. The specific objectives of this research were as follows: (1) To explore the driving forces behind the increase in energy use of the construction sector and investigate energy consumption trajectory in the past two decades. (2) To quantify embodied energy use of the construction sector at the regional and sectoral level. (3) To decompose energy transmissions and identify critical energy paths in the entire supply chain from the sectoral and regional perspectives. (4) To develop a multi-regional hybrid framework for assessing embodied energy consumption at the project level by integrating regional average data and case-specific process data. (5) To verify and validate the reliability of the developed framework in real building cases through data from project level. The study firstly explored the driving forces behind the increase in energy use of China's construction industry from 1990 to 2010 by conducting a structural decomposition analysis (SDA). A multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model was then employed to investigate the hidden linkage and economic network among regional construction sectors by considering region-specific characteristic and technological differences. An optimized algorithm was designed for structural path analysis (SPA) to quantify indirect energy transmissions through the upstream supply chain of the construction sector. Ultimately, a multi-regional hybrid framework for embodied energy assessment of construction projects was proposed by integrating three modules: the region-based sectoral energy intensity module (RBSEIM), the process-based energy intensity module (PBEIM), and the computational structure module (CSM). The hybrid framework was then validated in real cases by conducting comparative and empirical analyses. The key findings obtained in this study include the following aspects. First, the results of SDA indicate that the energy consumption trajectory of China's construction sector is the result of competition between the effect of increasing final demand and improvement in energy efficiency. Although consistent efforts in structural optimization by the central government had significant positive effects between 2007 and 2010, the potential to reduce much more energy remains dependent on optimization of energy structure, production structure, and final demand structure. Second, the results of MRIO analysis show that the construction sector consumed 793. 74 million <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent</b> in 2007, which is equal to 29. 6 % of China's total national energy consumption. Interregional imports of the construction sector represented a resource-dependent geographical distribution, implying that the energy flows are from resource-abundant areas in the central part of the country to resource-deficient areas on the eastern coast. By contrast, energy exports represent a regional discrete distribution, which exports energy in the form of labor mobility and service supply. Third, the findings from SPA revealed that the first two stages in the upstream production process consumed the highest amount of energy in the supply chain, accounting for approximately 50 % of total energy consumption. The regional analysis revealed the self-sufficiency characteristic for energy consumption in the regional construction sectors. The sectoral analysis demonstrated that imports from sectors of "manufacturing of non-metallic mineral products", "smelting and pressing of metals", and "transportation, storage, post, and telecommunications" are the most important energy flows in the first stage. The sectors of "chemical industry", "production and distribution of electric power and heat power", and mining industries pose significant indirect impact on the energy use of the construction sector. Ultimately, the comparative analyses and empirical studies of the developed hybrid framework indicate that it not only enables us to explore interregional energy transfers but also exhibits 'hidden' embodied energy consumption. The framework can also reflect the effects of changes in geographical location, building type, and building structure on the total embodied energy consumption. This study contributes the sustainable construction at three levels of investigation: national level, regional level, and project level. At the national level, the research explored the driving forces and trajectory of the embodied energy consumption of the construction sector, which revealed the potential areas for improvements in sustainable construction. At the regional level, the inter-regional energy transfers and the indirect energy input through the higher order of upstream supply chain were systematically analyzed and decomposed for the construction sector, which not only enhances our understanding of overall energy flows of the construction sector at the regional level but also reinforces the importance of specific energy-intensive paths. At the project level, the embodied energy assessment system provided valuable information in terms of embodied energy use at the early stage of a construction project, which enables stakeholders to take appropriate actions and formulate effective strategies to reduce energy use embodied in the project. From an academic point of view, the sectoral and regional analysis of driving forces, energy flows, and the supply chain provided contributions to knowledge regarding SDA, MRIO, and SPA of the construction sector. In addition, recognizing the hidden linkage in the interregional trade of China's construction sector can help with a holistic understanding of the current energy consumption status of regions and also help policy makers to achieve a fair and equitable energy reduction policy. From the viewpoint of practice, the multi-regional embodied energy assessment framework is an effective tool for pre-estimating embodied energy use at the initial stage of a project, which could provide practitioners with an incentive to develop construction sustainability.
