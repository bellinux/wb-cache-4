5|$|A {{pressing}} issue {{not resolved}} by Wilson {{was the question}} of policy towards Bolshevik Russia. The U.S. had been among the nations that had sent troops there after the Russian Revolution. Afterwards, Wilson refused to recognize the Russian SFSR. Under Harding, Commerce Secretary Hoover, with considerable experience of Russian affairs, took the lead on policy. When famine struck Russia in 1921, Hoover had the American Relief Administration, which he had headed, negotiate with the Russians <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>aid.</b> Soviet leaders (the U.S.S.R. was established in 1922) hoped in vain that the agreement would lead to recognition. Hoover supported trade with the Soviets, fearing U.S. companies would be frozen out of the Soviet market, but Hughes opposed this, and the matter was not resolved under Harding's presidency.|$|E

5|$|On 3February, {{the head}} of the State Emergency Service (SES) and then-Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen toured {{northern}} Queensland to inspect damage. The government of Australia vowed to assist by providing financial and emergency services, also offering <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>aid</b> to banana and sugar cane farmers who suffered losses as a result of Winifred. Two government helicopters were sent shortly thereafter, assessing the severity of damage, evacuating residents, and delivering food. Bjelke-Petersen later expressed anger at the federal government for having increased the threshold for disaster relief before raising loans, and also stated that the Federal Minister for Primary Industry, John Kerin, had no right to accompany him on his visit to northern Queensland, only offering to discuss an offer provided that the federal government was willing to provide financial assistance. Approximately 500volunteers for the SES were deployed the same day, reinstating electrical and other essential services, evacuating regional citizens, delivering bread to numerous towns, and sending 700tarpaulins to shield roofless houses. Rescue and relief work was hindered by high traffic on telephone networks, forcing Telecom to cease calls between Townsville and Ingham.|$|E
5|$|Supplies {{had been}} brought in {{through the air and}} via the Mexican navy {{containing}} food, blankets, and medicine early on October2. However, additional bad weather initially prevented further supplies from coming in. Around that time, President Echeverria ordered emergency aid to be sent La Paz, Los Mochis, and Ciudad Obregon, as well as three coastal Sonoran ports. In addition, officials set up tents to house 40,000homeless persons. Meanwhile, city officials appealed for additional food, medicine, and construction materials. Gerald Ford, who was then the U.S. president, agreed <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>aid</b> for victims of Hurricane Liza; the first of which arrived late on October2, containing food and construction materials. The next day, power had been restored to hospitals, government centers, and gas stations. The government said that it was rushing in 100,000meals as well as 40,000temporary shelters the first of which started to arrive on October5. within a week after the storm, however, one survivor of the storm noted that plenty of food had arrived from many places.|$|E
5|$|With {{effect from}} June 12, {{a state of}} public {{emergency}} was declared {{for the whole of}} Tuvalu, by the then Governor-General of Tuvalu, Sir Tulaga Manuella. This was because there was only a limited amount of food available on Funafuti to cater for the whole of the island nation, while providing Niulakita with immediate relief supplies. This enabled the Tuvaluan embassy in Suva, Fiji to appeal to various overseas countries and organisations including Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United Nations Development Programme <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>aid</b> and assistance to the island nation. During June 14, the Royal New Zealand Air Force deployed a transport plane carrying some relief materials including tarpaulins and water from New Zealand. The plane subsequently stopped in Noumea, New Caledonia and Nadi, Fiji to pick up further relief supplies that had been donated by Australia, Fiji and France. The crew of the plane subsequently conducted an aerial assessment of the damage on Niulakita, and reported seeing widespread damage, before they arrived at Funafuti Airport during June 15.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, the Nicaraguan {{government}} {{declared a}} state of disaster in the North and South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Regions, as well as Tisma in the Masaya Department. The government sheltered those made homeless in Bluefields along the Atlantic coast. Relief efforts were coordinated by the Comit√© Nacional de Emergencia <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>aid</b> to the affected storm victims. Officials sent medical crews to the hardest hit areas. This was due to an increased potential for the spread of water-born diseases, the result of ongoing floods and damaged sanitation facilities. Meanwhile, planes flew overhead {{to determine the extent of}} damage. On August18, the government requested international assistance to cope from the disaster. In response, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the UNDP sent US$70,000 in emergency aid, some of which to be used for fuel to transport medicine and food. The World Food Programme sent 72tons of food and milk. The countries of Japan and the United States were the first to respond; the former provided $100,000, and the latter sent a Lockheed C-130 Hercules to distribute food. Switzerland later sent US$81,000 as a cash donation, while the European Economic Community sent US$227,000 worth of food and medicine. After Tropical Storm Gert struck in early September, various other countries sent additional money, food, medicine, and other goods.|$|E
5|$|Yule {{asserts that}} the {{additional}} Fulin embassies during the Tang period arrived in 711 and 719 AD, with another in 742 AD {{that may have been}} Nestorian monks. Adshead lists four official diplomatic contacts with Fulin in the Old Book of Tang as occurring in 643, 667, 701, and 719 AD. He speculates that the absence of these missions in Western literary sources can be explained by how the Byzantines typically viewed political relations with powers of the East, as well as the possibility that they were launched on behalf of frontier officials instead of the central government. Yule and Adshead concur that a Fulin diplomatic mission occurred during the reign of Justinian II (r. 685‚Äì695 AD; 705‚Äì711 AD). Yule claims it occurred in the year of the emperor's death, 711 AD, whereas Adshead contends that it took place in 701 AD during the usurpation of Leontios and the emperor's exile in Crimea, perhaps the reason for its omission in Byzantine records and the source for confusion in Chinese histories about precisely who sent this embassy. Justinian II regained the throne with the aid of Bulgars and a marriage alliance with the Khazars. Adshead therefore believes a mission sent to Tang China would be consistent with Justinian II's behaviour, especially if he had knowledge of the permission Empress Wu Zetian granted to Narsieh, son of Peroz III, to march against the Arabs in Central Asia {{at the end of the}} 7th century. The 719 AD Fulin embassy ostensibly came from Leo III the Isaurian (r. 717‚Äì741 AD) to the court of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (r. 712‚Äì756 AD), during a time when the Byzantine emperor was again reaching out to Eastern powers with a renewed Khazar marriage alliance. The year of this embassy coincided with Xuanzong's refusal <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>aid</b> to the Sogdians of Bukhara and Samarkand against the Arab invasion force. An embassy from the Umayyad Caliphate was received by the Tang court in 732 AD; the Arab victory at the 751 AD Battle of Talas and the An Lushan Rebellion crippled Tang Chinese interventionist efforts in Central Asia.|$|E
