This paper examines the two commonly implemented mastery learning strategies - personalised system of instructions and learning for mastery (LFM) - by focusing on what occurs {{when there is an}} instructional <b>time</b> <b>constraint.</b> Using a large data set from a postgraduate finance course offered at an Australian university, we explore students&# 039; online quiz-completion patterns, then empirically investigate whether the imposition of an instructional <b>time</b> <b>constraint</b> in the OML approach has an impact on their final-examination performance. Our results suggest that the LFM strategy with an instructional <b>time</b> <b>constraint</b> has a positive impact on students&# 039; learning behaviour and contributes to better overall academic performance. Further, our findings suggest that facilitators should be encouraged to implement an instructional <b>time</b> <b>constraint</b> when adopting an OML approach...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a <b>time</b> <b>constraint</b> dominant-set clustering algorithm for shot grouping and {{scene segmentation}}, in which the similarity between shots is based on autocorrelogram feature, motion feature and <b>time</b> <b>constraint.</b> Therefore, the visual evidence and <b>time</b> <b>constraint</b> contained in the video content are effectively incorporated into a unified clustering framework. Moreover, the number of clusters in our algorithm does not need to be predefined and thus it provides an automatic framework for scene segmentation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a system level power {{optimization}} problem : A problem to assign optimal VDD to each job under a <b>time</b> <b>constraint.</b> The objective function is total energy for the processing of all jobs. The proposed voltage assignment method consists of following two concepts. ffl If some jobs are processed on single processor system under a <b>time</b> <b>constraint,</b> assigning lower supply voltage to the set of jobs whose <b>time</b> <b>constraint</b> is loose. ffl If some jobs are processed under a <b>time</b> <b>constraint</b> and the switched capacitances ((load capacitance) 2 (switching activity)) of jobs are different each other, assigning lower supply voltage to the heavier jobs and higher voltage to the lighter jobs. We define the VDD assignment problem and formulate it as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. An optimal assignment can be obtained by solving the ILP problem.

40|$|In recent years, {{more and}} more {{heterogeneous}} processor cores are embedded into a single chip. To deploy such heterogeneous embedded systems in critical applications, e. g., aircraft control, battleship missile launches, nuclear plant safe operations, etc., an important research problem is how to maximize system reliability while satisfying the required <b>time</b> <b>constraint.</b> Therefore, a scheduling scheme is needed to exploit the heterogeneity of a system and satisfy both the reliability requirement and the given <b>time</b> <b>constraint.</b> In this paper, we study the heterogeneous reliability scheduling problem, i. e., given a heterogeneous system, a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that models an application and a <b>time</b> <b>constraint,</b> find a schedule for the DAG so that the system reliability can be maximized and the <b>time</b> <b>constraint</b> can be met. To solve this problem, two heuristic algorithms, MCMS and PRMS, are proposed. The experimental results show that our algorithms can improve system reliability significantly. Among them, PRMS has the best performance and the improvement of reliability can be up to 30 %. KEY WORDS heterogeneous system, scheduling, reliability...|$|R

This pa-per discusses the design and implementation of a discrete-event simulation system used for assessing how risk and <b>time</b> <b>constraint</b> can impact group information seeking and handling (i. e., foraging) during emergency response. A demonstration is given of how system parameters may be tuned in order to manipulate risk, <b>time</b> <b>constraint,</b> distribu-tion of information and resources available for response.

40|$|In {{order to}} solve the problem of optimal {{impulsive}} orbital 3 D maneuver with or without time con- straint one must rst solve the optimal condition's equations. There are dierent and numerous modes of geometry, all of these modes must be considered. Solving this problem with the geometric modes has, to my knowledge, not been done before. In this paper the problem has been solved in two states: with <b>time</b> <b>constraint</b> and no <b>time</b> <b>constraint</b> while considering all possible geometric modes. The purpose of this paper is solving the problem and achieving the global answer. For considering all possible modes of geom- etry, the relations of oblique spherical triangle must be used. All necessary angles can be determined by using these relations. In this paper, 16 modes for exposure of initial orbit to nal orbit and 16 modes for exposure of transfer orbit to initial and nal orbits are classied. Then, the optimal condition equations have been solved. Solving the equations led to only one local minimum and the global answer cannot be identied. Therefore, the process is required to determine global answer. In this paper, the explicit equations have been extracted which by using them, intermediary variables evaluated with respect to in- dependent variables. Then, the function of impulse can be minimized to independent variables separately. The exact location of global answer can be determined by examining the behavior of the function to the independent variables. Therefore, the global answer can be obtained. Finally, the method is applied for the numerical example. The initial and nal orbits is elliptical and non coplanar and elements of them are certain. The example is solved in two modes of <b>time</b> <b>constraint</b> and no <b>time</b> <b>constraint.</b> In <b>time</b> <b>constraint</b> mode, the <b>time</b> of transfer must be 2500 seconds. In this mode some results have been veried by solving the Lambert problem. In the non <b>time</b> <b>constraint</b> mode, the total required impulse is less than the <b>time</b> <b>constraint</b> mode as expected. The answers of two of these modes have been simulated by MATLAB code. The results show acceptable accuracy and high-speed computing...|$|R

40|$|Reading in {{a second}} {{language}} is an interesting area of research because the factors affecting reading have brought about much controversy in related theory and research. Particularly, schema theory has raised long-term debate about whether background knowledge facilitates or impedes reading comprehension. In recognition of such issue, the current research was conducted to {{examine the impact of}} background knowledge on second language reading comprehension. Additionally, the impact of <b>time</b> <b>constraint</b> on reading comprehension was also investigated. Thirty-one students of intermediate level of English in Le Quy Don high school, Vietnam took part in the study. Four cloze texts, two of familiar topics and two of unfamiliar topics, were administered under the conditions of limited time and unlimited time. The results revealed significantly positive effects of background knowledge and no <b>time</b> <b>constraint</b> on second language reading comprehension. Further, a significant interaction between background knowledge and <b>time</b> <b>constraint</b> was found. These findings have important implications for second language pedagogy in view of standardized and classroom assessment of reading performance.
