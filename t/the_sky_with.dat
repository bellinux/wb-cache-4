5|$|Pteranodon longiceps {{would have}} shared <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>with</b> the giant-crested {{pterosaur}} Nyctosaurus. Compared to P. longiceps, {{which was a}} very common species, Nyctosaurus was rare, making up only 3% of pterosaur fossils from the formation. Also less common was the early toothed bird, Ichthyornis.|$|E
5|$|GK Persei, {{also known}} as Nova Persei 1901, is a bright nova that {{appeared}} halfway between Algol and Delta Persei. Discovered on 21 February 1901 by Scottish amateur astronomer Thomas David Anderson, it peaked at magnitude 0.2almost as bright as Capella and Vega. It faded to magnitude 13 around 30 years after its peak brightness. Xi Persei, traditionally known as Menkhib, a blue giant of spectral type O7III, {{is one of the}} hottest bright stars in <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>with</b> a surface temperature of 37,500 K. It {{is one of the more}} massive stars, being between 26 and 32 solar masses, and is 330,000 times as luminous as our Sun.|$|E
5|$|The game {{contains}} {{three types}} of clouds: white clouds, which follow the avatar; gray, neutral clouds, which become white when touched; and black clouds, which may be combined with white clouds to cause rain, dissolving both clouds. A large number of white clouds more easily dissolves {{a small number of}} dark clouds than an equal number, and vice versa. White clouds stop following the avatar if the player moves too quickly and they resume following if approached again. Each of the four missions in Cloud has a different objective, including forming patterns in <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>with</b> clouds, eliminating black clouds, and creating rain over each of the islands.|$|E

5|$|While searching a motel for supplies, L.J. is {{bitten by}} a zombie, which he keeps secret. The next morning the convoy is {{attacked}} by crows that had been feeding on the infected. The crows almost overwhelm the convoy, killing Nurse Betty and Otto and taking out the flamethrower operator, causing the weapon to careen out of control. Alice finally appears and saves Carlos and the others from a fiery death, using her telekinesis to fill <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>with</b> fire, killing the crows and leaving her unconscious. After recovering, Alice is introduced to Claire and gives her the diary she found, and she and Carlos then convince Claire to take her convoy to Alaska.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, Parsons and Merle Tuve of NDRC {{began work}} on a new concept. Shooting down an {{aircraft}} with an anti-aircraft gun was a difficult proposition. As a shell had to hit a speeding aircraft at an uncertain altitude, the only hope seemed to be to fill <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>with</b> ammunition. A direct hit was not actually required; an aircraft might be destroyed or critically damaged by a shell detonating nearby. With this in mind, anti-aircraft gunners used time fuzes to increase the possibility of damage. The question then arose as to whether radar {{could be used to}} create an explosion in the proximity of an aircraft. Tuve's first suggestion was to have an aircraft drop a radar-controlled bomb on a bomber formation. Parsons saw that while this was technically feasible, it was tactically problematic.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, McGovern {{joined the}} 741st Squadron of the 455th Bombardment Group of the Fifteenth Air Force, {{stationed}} at San Giovanni Airfield near Cerignola in the Apulia region of Italy. There {{he and his}} crew found a starving, disease-ridden local population wracked by the ill fortunes of war and far worse off than anything they had seen back home during the Depression. Those sights would form part of his later motivation to fight hunger. Starting on November 11, 1944, McGovern flew 35missions over enemy territory from San Giovanni, the first five as co-pilot for an experienced crew and the rest as pilot for his own plane, known as the Dakota Queen after his wife Eleanor. His targets were in Austria; Czechoslovakia; Nazi Germany; Hungary; Poland; and northern, German-controlled Italy, and were often either oil refinery complexes or rail marshalling yards, all {{as part of the}} U.S.strategic bombing campaign in Europe. The eight- or nine-hour missions were grueling tests of endurance for pilots and crew, and while German fighter aircraft were a diminished threat by this time as compared to earlier in the war, his missions often faced heavy anti-aircraft artillery fire that filled <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>with</b> flak bursts.|$|E

5|$|The Skidi {{people of}} Native Americans saw {{the stars of}} Corona Borealis {{representing}} a council of stars whose chief was Polaris. The constellation also symbolised the smokehole over a fireplace, which conveyed their messages to the gods, {{as well as how}} chiefs should come together to consider matters of importance. The Shawnee people saw the stars as the Heavenly Sisters, who descended from the sky every night to dance on earth. Alphecca signifies the youngest and most comely sister, who was seized by a hunter who transformed into a field mouse to get close to her. They married though she later returned to <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>with</b> her heartbroken husband and son following later. The Mi'kmaq of eastern Canada saw Corona Borealis as Mskegwǒm, the den of the celestial bear (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta Ursae Majoris).|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{achievements}} were accordingly generally modest. The one accomplished astronomer was Johannes Hevelius (1611–87) of Danzig, {{noted for}} the accurate observations of <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>with</b> the equipment he constructed. Adam A.

25|$|The {{concept of}} world trees is a {{prevalent}} motif in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cosmologies and iconography.

25|$|In {{tropical}} regions Crux {{can be seen}} in the sky from April to June. Crux {{is exactly}} opposite to Cassiopeia on the celestial sphere, and therefore it cannot appear in <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>with</b> the latter at the same time. For locations south of 34°S, Crux is circumpolar and thus always visible in the night sky.|$|E

25|$|Two ancient legends tell of mythical origins for the city.

The second myth features Kronos, who eviscerated his father Ouranos, god of <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>with</b> a sickle which, falling into the sea, created the city. In ancient times, Saturn was the god-protector of Trapani. Today, Saturn's statue stands in a piazza in the centre of the city.|$|E

25|$|Thomas J. Bopp (born October 15, 1949) is {{best known}} as co-discoverer of comet Hale–Bopp (with Alan Hale) in 1995.

On the night of July 22, Bopp was observing <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>with</b> friends in the Arizona desert when he made the discovery. It was the first comet he had observed and he was using a borrowed, home-built telescope. Hale and Bopp both discovered the comet by chance at approximately the same time.|$|E
