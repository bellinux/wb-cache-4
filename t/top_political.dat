25|$|Thomas's {{political}} activity also included attempts at the US presidency. Following Eugene Debs's death in 1926, {{there was a}} leadership vacuum in the Socialist Party. Neither of the party's two <b>top</b> <b>political</b> leaders, Victor L. Berger and Hillquit, were eligible {{to run for president}} because of their foreign birth. The third main figure, Daniel Hoan, was occupied as mayor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Down to approximately 8,000 dues paying members, the Socialist Party's options were limited, and the little-known minister from New York with oratorial skills and a pedigree in the movement became the choice of the 1928 National Convention of the Socialist Party.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Zhou became Party Secretary of Sichuan, the {{province}}'s <b>top</b> <b>political</b> office. Sichuan was China's {{second most}} populous province at the time. Prior to Zhou, most of Sichuan's provincial leaders originated from the province. Zhou, an outsider, brought {{change to the}} province's political landscape. He spearheaded economic modernization policies and in particular focused on agricultural modernization. Sichuan {{was known to be}} a province highly dependent on agriculture, and its government operated at a slower pace compared to those of China's coastal regions. Zhou was known for his quick and efficient decision-making, significantly altering the traditionally lax culture of the province's civil service.|$|E

Philbin, flew to Camp Delta to view Mohammed al-Kahtani, to Charleston, South Carolina to view Padilla, {{and finally to}} Norfolk, Virginia, to view Yaser Esam Hamdi; they consulted with their interrogators over the process and {{to see how the}} prisoners were holding up. The Office of Legal Counsel in August 2002, in {{what became known as the}} Torture Memos, had authorized the CIA to use certain enhanced interrogation techniques, and some of these had been used against al-Khatani, Hamdi and Padilla.|$|E
25|$|Laxalt {{retired from}} the Senate in 1987 and was {{replaced}} by the man he had defeated in 1974, Harry Reid, who would go on to become the Senate Majority Leader. Laxalt made a brief run for the Republican Presidential nomination during 1987. The campaign lasted only four months after Laxalt determined that the effort had fallen short of its fundraising goals. Political commentators at the time concluded that he had waited too long to enter the race, which meant that not only did his competitors have a leg up in organization, but many of the <b>top</b> <b>political</b> strategists and fundraisers had already signed on with other camps. He was eventually named a co-chairman of George H.W. Bush's successful presidential campaign. Eight years later, he served in a similar capacity in Bob Dole's failed presidential bid.|$|E

25|$|Wang {{entered the}} Jiangsu provincial {{government}} in the late 1990s. At {{the turn of the}} century, Wang received a series of quick promotions to progressively senior positions. After serving a two-year tenure in the Agricultural Science Institute of Jiangsu, Wang went on to become deputy director of the provincial department of agriculture. In 2000, ostensibly due to his academic background, he was transferred to head the provincial department of education. In 2001, he was again transferred, this time to take on the post of acting Mayor of Wuxi; he was formally elected mayor in 2002. In 2003, he was again promoted to become the city's Communist Party Secretary, which was, in reality, the city's <b>top</b> <b>political</b> office. By 2004, only four years since serving as deputy director of the department of agriculture, he earned a seat on the provincial Party Standing Committee, the province's top decision making body, joining the inner circle of the Jiangsu political elite and becoming one of the province's top-ranked politicians.|$|E
25|$|In Guangdong, the {{campaign}} severely upset the political ecosystem {{that had long}} been dominated by native Cantonese politicians. Wan Qingliang, the popular and relatively youthful party chief of Guangzhou known for his frugality and accessibility, was sacked {{in the third quarter}} of 2014, and was also replaced by an outsider, former Tianjin vice mayor Ren Xuefeng. The province's <b>top</b> <b>political</b> advisor, Zhu Mingguo, also became one of the few incumbent officials of full provincial rank to be investigated for corruption. Vice Governor Liu Zhigeng, another native Cantonese official who was once the party chief of Dongguan, and Zhuhai party chief Li Jia, who had spent his entire political career in Guangdong, were also sacked. The breaking down of local patronage networks had already begun before the 18th Party Congress, and continued with greater intensity following the Congress under newly anointed party chief Hu Chunhua. The party leadership team in Shenzhen, China's most successful Special Economic Zone, also underwent significant changes, with party chief Wang Rong moving to a provincial office; several of Wang's subordinates were investigated for corruption.|$|E
25|$|He was re-elected in single-candidate {{elections}} in 1977 and 1984. He {{spent most of}} his time increasing his personal fortune, which in 1984 was estimated to amount to US$5billion, most of it in Swiss banks (however, a comparatively small $3.4million has been found after his ousting). This was almost equivalent to the country's foreign debt at the time, and, by 1989, the government was forced to default on international loans from Belgium. He owned a fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles that he used to travel between his numerous palaces, while the nation's roads rotted and many of his people starved. Infrastructure virtually collapsed, and many public service workers went months without being paid. Most of the money was siphoned off to Mobutu, his family, and <b>top</b> <b>political</b> and military leaders. Only the Special Presidential Division – on whom his physical safety depended – was paid adequately or regularly. A popular saying that the civil servants pretended to work while the state pretended to pay them expressed this grim reality.|$|E
