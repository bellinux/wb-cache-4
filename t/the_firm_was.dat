5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty of {{obstruction}} of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although {{only a small number of}} Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> <b>was</b> effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs.

The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations.

Following this case, although initially irritated by Guest, Coghlan invited him to join his firm in Salisbury, which Guest did in January 1912. The Salisbury office had been opened by Bernard Tancred. His passing away provided the opportunity for Guest to join the firm as a partner.

5|$|In {{order to}} further enhance the appeal of its new {{flagship}} product, in 1993 the firm established a Communication Services division, designed {{to tap into the}} commercial market. The firm started making deals with major telecommunication companies, such as BellSouth and MCI Inc. in preparation for the services <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> <b>was</b> about to offer. In November of that year the division launched its Fax Broadcast service. The Fax Broadcast service allowed subscribers to upload a single fax and a recipient list to Delrina. Systems at Delrina would then send out the fax to the recipients on that list, to a maximum of 500 fax numbers. A subsequent Fax Mailbox feature—which enabled subscribers to remotely access both fax and voice messages from a single phone number—was initially held up following a dispute with AlphaNet Telecom for the rights to the technology. This dispute was resolved by June 1994, though with both sides publicly disputing the story of the other, and with AlphaNet receiving an undisclosed sum in compensation.|$|E
