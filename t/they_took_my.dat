Only three people I know figured out it was even me when they saw it." [...] Actor and musician Johnny Depp guest starred in the episode [...] "SpongeBob vs. The Big One" [...] as the voice of Jack Kahuna Laguna, a surf guru that taught SpongeBob how to surf. According to Sarah Noonan, vice president of talent and casting for Nickelodeon, Depp accepted the role because he and his kids are fans of the show.

I flipped at the opportunity to be in the show. I have four kids, and everybody loved SpongeBob." [...] In the entry [...] "The Clash of Triton", English singer Victoria Beckham guest starred in the episode as the wife of King Neptune, Queen Amphitrite. The writers created the role of a Queen Amphitrite especially for Beckham.

Beckham recorded the voice-over in late-2008 in a day, and claimed that she was [...] "thrilled" [...] to provide the vocal cameo.

I could have been anyone, and {{they could have done}} anything they liked with the bottles." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} Khan {{said that}} she, unlike other artists, felt very {{optimistic about the}} current changes in the recording industry, including music downloading. [...] "I'm glad things are shifting and artists – not labels – are having {{more control over their}} art. My previous big record company (Warner Bros.) has vaults of my recordings that haven't seen the light of day that people need to hear. This includes Robert Palmer's original recording of 'Addicted to Love' – which <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> vocals off of! We are working on getting it (and other tracks) all back now." [...] In 2009, Khan hit the road with singers Anastacia and Lulu for Here Come the Girls.|$|E

[...] By late September 2010, Floridians and businesses criticized the claims process, claiming it has gotten worse under Feinberg's leadership, some saying the president and BP [...] "should dump Feinberg if he doesn't get his act together soon". The Obama Administration responded to criticism from Florida officials, including Gov. Charlie Crist and CFO Alex Sink, with a stern letter to Feinberg, saying the present pace of claims is [...] "unacceptable" [...] and directing his office to make whatever changes necessary to move things along. [...] "The Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill has disrupted {{the lives of thousands}} upon thousands of individuals, often cutting off the income on which they depend. Many of these individuals and businesses simply do not have the resources to get by while they await processing by the GCCF" [...] associate U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perrelli wrote. One family in Louisiana has been waiting for a month on emergency funds from Feinberg's Gulf Coast Claims Fund, and says for them it is urgent.

But I must love no creature. Why, Christ loved-- Mary he loved, and Martha, and their brother-- Three friends! and I have none! When Lazarus lay dead, He groaned in spirit, And wept--like any widow--Jesus wept!

60|$|Twenty {{minutes before}} nine that night, we were {{deposited}} at the Pacific Transfer Station near Council Bluffs, {{on the eastern}} bank of the Missouri river. Here we were to stay the night at a kind of caravanserai, set apart for emigrants. But I {{gave way to a}} thirst for luxury, separated myself from my companions, and marched with my effects into the Union Pacific Hotel. A white clerk and a coloured gentleman whom, in my plain European way, I should call the boots, were installed behind a counter like bank tellers. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> name, assigned me a number, and proceeded to deal with my packages. And here came the tug of war. I wished to give up my packages into safe keeping; but I did not wish to go to bed. And this, it appeared, was impossible in an American hotel.|$|E

I don't want a hot pillow--and I don't want my arms covered. Say, I wish you'd send word to old Jack. I don't know where he is, but he'd come--so will Reynolds. These policemen will have a hot time keeping me here after they come. It's too low here, I must take Mary away--it's healthier in the mountains. It ain't so hot----" ...|$|E
60|$|I married. I {{found that}} there were greater forces at work than I had ever dreamed of. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> husband away from me and molded him into the {{political}} lieutenant of my father. And I was without power. I could do nothing for the cause. I was beaten. Then it was that I got a new vision. The future belonged to the children. There I could play my woman's part. I was a mother. Very well. I could do no better than to bring into the world a healthy son and bring him up to manhood healthy and wholesome, clean, noble, and alive. Did I do my part well, through him the results would be achieved. Through him would the work of the world be done in making the world healthier and happier for all the human creatures in it. I played the mother's part. That is why I left the pitiful little charities of the church and devoted myself to settlement work and tenement house reform, established my kindergartens, and worked for the little men and women who come so blindly and to whom the future belongs to make or mar.|$|E
