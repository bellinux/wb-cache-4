On {{the final day of}} the season, the Jets beat the Packers following a New England victory over Miami.

The Jets began the playoffs against the Indianapolis Colts at home, and defeated them 41–0. The Jets then played the Raiders, who again defeated them in Oakland, 30–10. The Jets lost a number of key players to free agency in the offseason.
