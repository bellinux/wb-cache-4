5|$|As in {{plot and}} setting, Tolkien brings his {{literary}} theories {{to bear in}} forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo as a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is {{the form of the}} riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. <b>This</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading {{to an understanding of the}} deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in The Hobbit.|$|E
25|$|The Mahāsāṃghika coupled <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the {{luminous}} mind {{with the idea}} of the mulavijnana, the substratum consciousness that serves as the basis consciousness.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{emergence}} {{has been}} around since at least the time of Aristotle. John Stuart Mill and Julian Huxley are two of many scientists and philosophers who have written on the concept.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{connected}} {{learning is}} supposed to be an alternative to traditional in-school instruction. They label this connected learning framework as a work in progress that needs more research to support it. However, no further research has been completed on this framework.|$|E
25|$|In {{the society}} of states tradition, states are seen as {{individual}} entities that can mutually agree on common interests and rules of interaction, including moral rules, {{in much the same}} way as human individuals can. Often, <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> agreement between peers is formalised by a social contract argument.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> rule by Islamic jurists {{was spread}} through his book , mosque sermons, smuggled {{cassette}} speeches by Khomeini, among Khomeini's opposition network of students (talabeh), ex-students (able clerics such as Morteza Motahhari, Mohammad Beheshti, Mohammad-Javad Bahonar, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Mofatteh), and traditional businessmen (bazaari) inside Iran.|$|E
25|$|He also {{stressed}} the importance of the entrepreneur to economic change, which he saw as being brought about by “the heroic intervention of individual men who appear as leaders toward new economic shores.” <b>This</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> leadership was later taken up by Joseph Schumpeter in his treatment of economic innovation.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the {{historical}} progression towards the acceptance of ever greater levels of dissonance is somewhat oversimplified and glosses over important developments {{in the history of}} Western music, the general idea was attractive to many 20th-century modernist composers and is considered a formative meta-narrative of musical modernism.|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The experience of dementia is raises many important {{questions about the}} nature of self and personhood. No disease is experienced in isolation and dementia embodies <b>this.</b> <b>Ideas</b> <b>of</b> loss of self and loss of life feature strongly in dementia and have the potential to profoundly affect a person’s spirituality. The Christian faith offers the possibility of retaining and recovering the sense of personhood and connection with God and others. This allows for the possibility of hope...|$|R

25|$|Pape {{specifically}} {{during her}} Neo-Concrete period {{was interested in}} the “proposal to ‘live the body.’” This phrase indicates Pape’s interest in how the physical body acts as our mediator for all sensual experiences. Pape sought to explore <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the body’s relation in space by creating multi-sensorial experiences in her artwork.|$|E
25|$|The {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} in equilibrium, each firm's expectations of how other firms will act are shown to be correct; when all is revealed, no firm wants to change its output decision. <b>This</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> stability was later taken up and built upon as a description of Nash equilibria, of which Cournot equilibria are a subset.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an {{organized}} witch-cult originates {{in the second}} half of the 15th century, notoriously expounded in the 1486 Malleus Maleficarum. In the following two centuries, witch trials usually included the charge of membership in a demonic conspiracy, gathering in sabbaths, and similar. It was only with the beginning Age of Enlightenment in the early 18th century, that the idea of {{an organized}} witch-cult was abandoned.|$|E
50|$|Kirill also {{encounters}} an underground, that is, a {{few people}} fighting against the corporate laws of functionals and their working for themselves or the elites of other worlds. He remains untouched by {{the rhetoric of the}} underground, justifying most <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> <b>Ideas</b> <b>of</b> armed opposition are alien if not to say ridiculous for him. However, a younger woman whom Kirril falls in love with is a genuine underground activist...|$|R

25|$|Pope takes <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the personified {{goddess of}} Dulness being {{at war with}} reason, {{darkness}} at war with light, and extends it to a full Aeneid parody. His poem celebrates a war, rather than a mere victory, and a process of ignorance, and Pope picks as his champion of all things insipid Lewis Theobald (1728 and '32) and Colley Cibber (1742).|$|E
25|$|World peace, or {{peace on}} Earth, {{is the concept}} of an ideal state of happiness, freedom and peace within and among all people and nations on earth. <b>This</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> world non-violence is one {{motivation}} for people and nations to willingly cooperate, either voluntarily or by virtue of a system of governance that prevents warfare. Different cultures, religions, philosophies and organisations have varying concepts on how such a state would come about.|$|E
25|$|Fuzûlî's most {{extended}} {{treatment of}} <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> love {{is in the}} long poem Dâstân-ı Leylî vü Mecnun (داستان ليلى و مجنون), a mesnevî which takes as its subject the classical Middle Eastern love story of Layla and Majnun. In {{his version of the}} story, Fuzûlî concentrates upon the pain of the mad lover Majnun's separation from his beloved Layla, and comes to see this pain as being of the essence of love.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>idea</b> — <b>of</b> finding sets of tiles {{that can}} only admit {{hierarchical}} structures — {{has been used in}} the construction of most known aperiodic sets of tiles to date.|$|R
25|$|Despite <b>this,</b> the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an {{independent}} bovine domestication event in Africa must be abandoned because subsequent evidence gathered {{over a period}} of thirty years has failed to corroborate this.|$|R
60|$|Modern minds need {{to become}} {{familiar}} with <b>this</b> indeterminate <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the savage Supreme Being, which, logically, may be prior to the evolution of the notion of ghost or spirit.|$|R
25|$|And it is {{occasionally}} visionary, as when Ludlow, {{decades before}} Albert Einstein {{would do the}} same, abandons {{the idea of the}} æther and muses that “e might be allowed to... assert that because our only cognitions of matter are cognitions of force, matter in the scientific sense is force.” He does not elaborate, and evidently the article was altered and cut for publication substantially, so we are left to wonder how far he pursued <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the equivalency of matter and energy.|$|E
25|$|His {{painting}} technique appeals {{primarily to}} a young and young at heart public whose interests lie in fashion, design and lifestyle products. As a result, Metzenmacher with his history in product design has added “collections” to go with each original. These collections are printed art pieces which differ in colour, size and fittings (frames). <b>This</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> different collections came from the fashion industry and has been transferred {{to the world of}} art by Metzenmacher. He calls his collections “edition” and “rallipan”.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{a romantic}} {{universal}} poesy {{can be seen}} clearly in the romantic triad. This theoretical structure always shows its recipient that the described moment is exactly the moment (kairos) in which the future is decided. These frequently mentioned critical points correspond with the artist’s feeling for the present, which Novalis shares with many other contemporaries of his time. Thus a triadic structure {{can be found in}} most of his works. This means that there are three corresponding structural elements which are written differently concerning the content and the form.|$|E
