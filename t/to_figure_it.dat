5|$|Determined to {{make this}} the king's happiest {{birthday}} ever and save the day, SpongeBob sets out to find Triton and bring him to the party. Once found, Triton initially ignores SpongeBob, but after smelling SpongeBob's terribly smelly breath, he tells him to undo the lock. Unable <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> out, SpongeBob calls his best friend, Patrick, to help out. Patrick unlocks Triton's cell, and the Prince escapes the island. No one anticipates Triton's wrath, Triton destroys Bikini Bottom. Noticing {{that something is wrong}} at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob and Patrick enter the building from the back, discovering the guests and staff locked in a cage. When Patrick unlocks the cell, Triton attempts to escape his father, who catches up to him. King Neptune can't tolerate his son's wrongdoings, but on seeing how Triton destroyed Bikini Bottom, is pleased that he's finally using powers, becoming a worthy successor. The family leaves for home, with King Neptune crediting SpongeBob for this development; the townsfolk of Bikini Bottom see differently, chasing him and Patrick in an angry mob.|$|E
25|$|When the {{aircraft}} was on final, the pilots received several warnings from ATC {{that they were}} 1000–2000 meters {{to the left of}} the landing course, followed by another warning that they were too low. The pilots were confused about their location and were trying <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> out based on reports from ATC, the flight computer and a portable GPS device. According to the final investigation report, they also ignored automatic altitude readouts that started at 60 m above ground level and continued every 10 m. Nine seconds before the impact, the pilot contacted ATC to ask if they were off course, still concentrated on aligning {{the aircraft}} with the runway and not on its altitude. The pilots made no effort to stop the descent.|$|E

The Sounds organization installed a modern version {{at the new}} venue, capable of displaying high-definition video. The first design renderings of First Tennessee Park did not feature a guitar scoreboard. On April 22, 2014, at the announcement of First Tennessee's naming rights agreement, Sounds owner Frank Ward told The Tennessean: [...] "The guitar scoreboard at Greer is staying at Greer.

500|$|Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès psychoanalysed The Shooting Star, {{describing}} it as [...] "the final attempt of the foundling [...] to rid {{himself of the}} bastard [...] and to preserve the integrity of his former values", {{pointing out that the}} first thirteen pages are devoted purely to the boy reporter. He also argued that Phostle and Philippus represent two-halves of [...] "an ambivalent father figure" [...] within the story, with the former prefiguring Calculus [...] "more than any other previous character". He suggests that when hiding on the Aurora, Philippus can be compared to The Phantom of the Opera, as he steals a stick of dynamite and climbs up the ship's mast before threatening to detonate the weapon. Apostolidès believed that the shooting star itself is [...] "more a religious mystery than a scientific one" [...] and that Tintin is therefore [...] "the perfect one <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> out in some religious way—that is, unrealistically". Apostolidès analysed the political component of the story in terms of [...] "the incarnation of unregulated capitalism against the spirit of European values", arguing that Hergé was adhering to [...] "a utopian vision that, in 1942, smacks of pro-German propaganda".|$|E
500|$|After Carey {{finished}} her The Adventures of Mimi Tour (2006) {{in support of}} her tenth studio album The Emancipation of Mimi (2005), she began to work on material for her eleventh studio effort, the yet untitled E=MC² (2008). E=MC² was hailed {{as one of the}} most anticipated albums to be released in 2008, with many critics weighing their opinions on whether Carey would be able to deliver significant success, following her achievements with The Emancipation of Mimi. After the release and success of [...] "Touch My Body", the project's lead single, subsequent singles of the album failed to garner airplay or significant charting, Island Records halted promotion of the album. Since the album's release, Carey had planned to embark on an extensive tour in support of E=MC², describing its production and direction in several interviews. When asked to describe the tour's theme, Carey explained [...] "I'm thinking elaborate. I like elaborate. We only do substantial. That's what my jeweler says. I haven't gotten the looks in mind just yet, but we're going <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> out soon enough." [...] Although plans for a tour were underway, and Carey's announcement for a tour during her promotional appearance on The X Factor in the United Kingdom in November 2008, the tour was suddenly cancelled in the following month.|$|E
500|$|Perry is the docile pet platypus of the blended Flynn-Fletcher family, who adopted {{him because}} his unfocused gaze {{made it seem}} as if he were looking at both Phineas and Ferb at the same time, as shown in the 2011 movie, [...] Unbeknownst to them, Perry lives a double life as a crime-fighting spy working for the [...] "Organization Without a Cool Acronym"/The OWCA, going by the codename [...] "Agent P." [...] He reports to his superior, Major Monogram, via {{telecast}} in his large, high-tech, underground hideout. Every day, he engages in battles with the evil scientist Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, who tries using inventions to take over the tri-state area. Perry is always able to foil Doofenshmirtz's plans and in doing so accidentally leads to the destruction of whatever form of contraption his owners, Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher, are building in order to make summer better. Phineas and Ferb are aware that something happens to get rid of their scheme for the day, but do not know that Perry is the cause behind it and are largely dismissive of it. Their sister, Candace, also does not know that Perry is behind the destruction and is driven to near insanity trying <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> out. Throughout the series, Perry is aware of Phineas and Ferb's inventions, but is largely uninterested in them, save whenever he notices that their latest invention may help him thwart Doofenshmirtz.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{commercial}} breaks, a brief {{image of a}} glyph is shown. Abrams revealed {{in an interview that}} the glyphs had a hidden meaning. [...] "It's something that we're doing for people who care <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> out and follow it, but it's not something that a viewer has to consider when they watch the show." [...] Abrams also revealed that the seemingly unrelated frogs which have the Greek letter Phi (Φ) imprinted on their back appeared in promos for the show have significance {{within the context of the}} series, saying [...] "it's part of the code of the show." [...] The glyph code was cracked by an editor at the technology site Ars Technica, who discovered it to be a simple substitution cipher used to spell out a single thematic word for each episode; for example, the pilot episode's eight glyphs spell out the word [...] "observer". Whether there is a further second-order code to be solved remains to be seen. Additionally, the glyphs are representative of some of the means by which Walter solves a case (such as the moth/butterfly from [...] "Johari Window", the seahorse strain of DNA from [...] "The Bishop Revival"). In [...] "Jacksonville", behind Walter as he speaks to Olivia about her treatment where the nootropic Cortexiphan was first studied as a trial, each of the glyphs is clearly visible on the daycare wall. An episode-by-episode key to the various glyphs was made available on Fringepedia.|$|E
500|$|Since the album's {{release in}} early April, Carey had said {{publicly}} that she planned on {{embarking on a}} large worldwide tour in support of E=MC². In an interview with Billboard on March 28, 2008, Carey explained [...] "It's come up, and I'm probably {{going to do it}}, but I don't know exactly how we're going to do it or when. I'm thinking probably September. But I think it's important to tour with this album, {{because there are so many}} songs that I really want to sing live, that I really enjoy." [...] Months later, in an interview with MTV News in July, Carey further addressed her plans of a tour: [...] "We're looking at November right now. Please don't hold me accountable if it turns out to be December 5 or December 7 or January 18!" [...] When asked to describe the tour's theme, Carey explained [...] "I'm thinking elaborate. I like elaborate. We only do substantial. That's what my jeweler says. I haven't gotten the looks in mind just yet, but we're going <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> out soon enough." [...] Despite continued plans for a tour, and announcements made on The X Factor in United Kingdom in November, the tour was suddenly cancelled by early December. Tabloids and critics began heavily speculating that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned plans for a tour as a result. Many claimed to have seen Carey visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles. Additionally, Carey's newly slimmed figure began to change, as she stopped her exercise routines and gained weight. Though Carey had eventually announced that she was pregnant with twins on November 28, 2010, over two years later, she admitted she had indeed been pregnant during that time period, and suffered a miscarriage. For that reason, she cancelled the tour, and lost the child only two months later.|$|E
500|$|One {{continuing}} subplot {{with the}} tour's scheduling was E Street drummer Max Weinberg's availability vis à vis {{his job as}} The Max Weinberg 7 bandleader for Conan O'Brien, given that {{during the first half}} of 2009 Late Night with Conan O'Brien in New York was ending and The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien in Los Angeles was beginning. [...] The mid-January announcement that Late Night would continue until February 20 precluded any notion of starting the tour immediately following Springsteen's appearance at Super Bowl XLIII, in addition to the band feeling that they had just gotten off the Magic Tour and [...] "Wait, let’s stop a minute." [...] Meanwhile, the June 1 start date of The Tonight Show posed problems for Weinberg's continued presence on the tour. [...] O'Brien told a Variety reporter at the time of the announcement that he hoped that Weinberg would follow him to Los Angeles and that he also hoped an arrangement could be worked out to let Weinberg go on the road with Springsteen as had been done for past tours. [...] At NBC, the coexistence between the drummer's two bosses was known as the Weinberg-Springsteen Rule, and was not typically extended to other talent at the network. [...] In a high-profile Rolling Stone cover story interview, Springsteen was vague about the matter: [...] "All I know is this – it's all gonna work out, one way or another. If people wanna come out and see the E Street Band, they'll be able to come out and see the E Street Band." [...] And whether Weinberg would stay with O'Brien and move or not was a subject of conflicting news reports until O'Brien confirmed on February 18 that Weinberg and the band were indeed coming with him. [...] A few days later, E Streeter Steven Van Zandt said of Weinberg's availability for the post-June 1, European leg: “We’re still figuring that out. We’ll see. I think Max will be there for most of it. ... I know he was very much trying <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> out.” [...] Weinberg had not missed an E Street Band show since joining the outfit in 1974, and Van Zandt said that no amount of rehearsal by another drummer could replace Weinberg's intuitive understanding of Springsteen's performance gambits.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{a set of}} famous {{experiments}} by Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold showed that the formation of nervous tissue is [...] "induced" [...] by signals {{from a group of}} mesodermal cells called the organizer region. For decades, though, the nature of the induction process defeated every attempt <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> out, until finally it was resolved by genetic approaches in the 1990s. [...] Induction of neural tissue requires inhibition of the gene for a so-called bone morphogenetic protein, or BMP. [...] Specifically the protein BMP4 appears to be involved. [...] Two proteins called Noggin and Chordin, both secreted by the mesoderm, are capable of inhibiting BMP4 and thereby inducing ectoderm to turn into neural tissue. [...] It appears that a similar molecular mechanism is involved for widely disparate types of animals, including arthropods as well as vertebrates. [...] In some animals, however, another type of molecule called Fibroblast Growth Factor or FGF may also {{play an important role in}} induction.|$|E
2500|$|At San Diego Comic-Con 2016, Russell and Debicki were {{revealed}} to be playing Ego, Quill's father, and Ayesha, respectively.
