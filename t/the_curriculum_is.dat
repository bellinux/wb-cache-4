40|$|This study investigates teachers’ {{views on}} primary school English {{language}} teaching <b>curriculum</b> for <b>the</b> 4 th grade. For this aim, objectives, content, activities, {{materials and equipment}} and assessment which are the basic components of <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> <b>are</b> taken as <b>the</b> criterion. Besides this, the study investigates teachers’ level of information about <b>the</b> <b>curriculum,</b> <b>the</b> difficulties that <b>were</b> experienced by teachers in implementing <b>the</b> <b>curriculum,</b> <b>the</b> {{strengths and weaknesses of}} <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> and teachers’ suggestions for improving <b>the</b> <b>curriculum.</b> This <b>is</b> a qualitative research and employs interview techniques. Data were collected through interviews of 15 primary school English teachers who taught 4 th grade students at state schools. In the data analysis procedure descriptive analysis techniques were applied. The results of the research indicated that the participants had negative views about some aspects of <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> due to challenges that they encountered during the implementation. It was determined that teachers thought that the level they informed about the program was not sufficient. Teachers emphasized that crowded classrooms, lack of sources and supplementary materials caused problems in implementing <b>the</b> <b>curriculum.</b> It <b>was</b> pointed out that the strongest feature of <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> <b>was</b> that it made the students active during the learning process. The weakest feature of <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> <b>was</b> that it was overloaded and time allocated to <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> <b>was</b> not sufficient. In order to make <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> more efficient teachers suggested that more qualified learning materials should be prepared, alloted time for the lesson should be increased, the number of students in the classroom should be reduced and assessment tools should be provided for the teachers...|$|R
