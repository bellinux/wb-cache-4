Investigation revealed that Callisto may possibly have a subsurface ocean of liquid water at depths less than 300 kilometres. The likely presence of an ocean within Callisto indicates that it can or could harbour life. However, this is less likely than on nearby Europa. Callisto has long been considered <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>suitable</b> place for a human base for future exploration of the Jupiter system since it is furthest from the intense radiation of Jupiter.|$|E

40|$|Normalization of {{quantitative}} gene expression data with a suitable reference gene {{is essential for}} accurate and reliable results. However, the availability and choice of <b>most</b> <b>suitable</b> reference gene(s) showing uniform expression across all the experimental conditions remain a drawback. We have developed a web server, PlantRGS ([URL] for <b>the</b> identification of <b>most</b> <b>suitable</b> candidate reference gene(s) at the whole-genome level using microarray data for quantitative gene expression studies in plants. Microarray data from more than 11 000 tissue samples for nine plant species {{have been included in}} the PlantRGS for meta-analysis.

5|$|Initially, diesel {{propulsion}} {{was planned}} for these ships, {{as had been}} used for the three Panzerschiffe. However, {{it was decided to}} use superheated steam propulsion. The main reason was that the required total output for the desired speed was three times that of the Panzerschiffe. In the case of triple-screw ships, this would have meant more than twice the shaft horsepower per shaft of the Panzerschiffe, {{and in the case of}} a quadruple-screw ship, this would have amounted to more than 40,000 horsepower per shaft. This requirement was beyond the diesel technology then available, and devising engines that could meet this demand would take an unforeseeable amount of time. Since high-pressure superheated steam had already proved successful, it was considered <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>suitable</b> choice for high power machinery.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} {{fluorine}} {{arose from the}} need to separate the isotope235U from 238U because the former, present in natural uranium at a concentration of less than 1% is fissile (capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction of nuclear fission with thermal neutrons), whereas the latter is not. Members of the MAUD Committee (especially Francis Simon and Nicholas Kurti) proposed the use of gaseous diffusion for isotope separation, since, according to Graham's law the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to molecular mass. After an extensive search, uranium hexafluoride, UF6, {{was determined to be}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>suitable</b> compound of uranium to be used for the gaseous diffusion process. Elemental fluorine is needed in the production of UF6.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th {{century the}} ideals of the Western European Enlightenment and the French Revolution became widely known to the Greek scholars. They soon {{realized}} the potential of these new ideals, and especially of popular freedom and sovereignty for their own national struggle against Ottoman rule. Adamantios Korais, a humanist scholar and leading figure of the modern Greek Enlightenment, had stressed the desirability of a printed medium, written in the vernacular language, in order to spread these ideas to the Greek people, that lived in the Ottoman Empire and the Diaspora in Western Europe as well. Korais explained about the necessity of a periodical that would gather material from political and philological newspapers of the enlightened peoples of Europe and contain reports from Ottoman-ruled Greece. He also stressed that this should be edited by a man of learning, and proposed that his friend Anthimos Gazis, scholar and Orthodox priest in Vienna, would be <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>suitable</b> person.|$|E

5|$|In 1936 the Air Ministry, the British {{government}} {{department responsible for}} the Royal Air Force, believed that {{in the event of}} war enemy aerial bombing of London would cause up to 200,000 casualties per week. British government commissions under Warren Fisher and Sir James Rae in 1937 and 1938 considered that key government offices should be dispersed from central London to the suburbs, and non-essential offices to the Midlands or North West. Pending this dispersal, in May 1938 Sir Hastings Ismay, then Deputy Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, ordered an Office of Works survey of Whitehall to identify a suitable site for a temporary emergency government centre. The Office concluded <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>suitable</b> site was the basement of the New Public Offices, a government building located on the corner of Horse Guards Road and Great George Street, near Parliament Square. The building now accommodates HM Treasury.|$|E
5|$|In January 1960 Heffron {{provided}} his {{old friend}} H. V. Evatt a dignified exit from federal politics by nominating him to succeed Sir Kenneth Street as Chief Justice of New South Wales. His Attorney General Reg Downing, however, was horrified, having favoured the senior puisne justice Sir William Owen as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>suitable</b> candidate while also realising that Evatt's worsening health would render him less than equal {{to the task of}} chief justice. Therefore, while Downing, as attorney general, would normally be the person to move the nomination of chief justice in cabinet, he refused to do so, leaving Heffron to do it himself. Heffron's motion to nominate Evatt was passed narrowly by 8 votes to 6. Downing's concerns would come to pass as Evatt indeed proved highly ineffective, often wracked by mental and physical ill-health, was reduced to having most of his judgements written or co-written for him, and resigning in 1962 after only two years as chief justice.|$|E

However, Winckel was seen {{to be one of the}} most experienced pilots because of his terrain knowledge as a flight instructor at Bandung and his recent refugee flights. Another factor was that his Lodestar, although it had been damaged in the attack on Broome, was considered <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>suitable</b> plane for the evacuation mission. Winckel flew to Java, where he managed to land his plane on a road lit by jeep headlights. He picked up fourteen passengers, refuelled the plane and successfully returned to Australia.|$|E

5|$|The first {{proposals}} for an airport on VÃ¦rÃ¸y were {{launched by the}} government in the late 1960s. A 1968 meteorological report concluded that the island was highly susceptible for strong winds, dominantly from the west, which could cause problems for air traffic. Three locations were considered: Kvalnes, RÃ¸ssnesvÃ¥gen og Nordlandet. The Norwegian Meteorological Institute concluded in 1973 that Nordlandet was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>suitable</b> location in terms of weather, but test flights showed otherwise. Nordlandet was the cheapest alternative. Estimates showed that the regularity at an airport would be significantly lower than at the existing heliport. This caused local politicians to wish to keep the existing service, but pressure from RÃ¸st caused VÃ¦rÃ¸y politicians to support an airport. After initial protests against Nordlandet as a site, Mayor Asmund Berg accepted the location on 3 May 1984. There had not been conducted sufficient test flights to establish the wind conditions above the airport caused by Teisthammeren, a mountain next to the airport. WiderÃ¸e was opposed to the location of the airport.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} tanks to equip {{armoured}} units led the War Cabinet {{to approve the}} manufacture of the Sentinel tank in 1940. Some 66 of them were delivered by the time manufacture ceased in July 1943, but none were used in action. Otherwise tanks were sourced from overseas. A quantity of M3 Stuart light tanks were received in September 1941, while the first shipment of British Matilda II tanks arrived in July 1942, and these proved to be <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>suitable</b> type for jungle warfare. A flame-thrower variant was produced and eventually saw action in the Borneo campaign. The most numerous tank used by the Australian Army was the M3 Lee. Several hundred of these equipped the armoured divisions, but unlike the Stuarts and Matildas, they did not see action. An Australian scout car known as the Dingo was produced as an interim measure until adequate supplies of the Canadian Staghound armoured car became available in 1944. The Australian Army also operated some amphibious tractors.|$|E
