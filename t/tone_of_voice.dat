25|$|A book-length {{study of}} the Court's work Harvard's Secret Court (St. Martin's Press, 2005) was written by William Wright. More of a popular dramatization than a history, the book recounts the Court's work in {{considerable}} detail, but also includes imagined conversations and considerable speculation. Where only the notes of an interrogation survive, the author reconstructs the questions and even characterizes the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> of the questioners.|$|E

25|$|The first {{opera house}} was opened in 1810 and {{destroyed}} by fire in 1873. The modern building was constructed by Fellner & Helmer in neo-baroque (Vienna Baroque) style and opened in 1887.

The unique acoustics of the horseshoe-designed hall allows to deliver even a whisper-low <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> from the stage to {{any part of the}} hall. The most recent renovation of the theater was completed in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Individuals in {{a current}} major {{depressive}} episode , a disorder characterized by social impairment, show deficits in theory of mind decoding. Theory of mind decoding {{is the ability to}} use information available in the immediate environment (e.g., facial expression, <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>voice,</b> body posture) to accurately label the mental states of others. The opposite pattern, enhanced theory of mind, is observed in individuals vulnerable to depression, including those individuals with past MDD, dysphoric individuals, and individuals with a maternal history of MDD.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant General Kawabe had {{travelled}} {{north to}} see the situation for himself on 25 May. Several officers whom he interviewed expressed confidence in success if reinforcements could be provided, but actually concealed their losses and {{the seriousness of the}} situation. At a meeting between Mutaguchi and Kawabe on 6 June, both used haragei, an unspoken form of communication using gesture, expression and <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>voice,</b> to convey their conviction that success was impossible, but neither of them wished to bear the responsibility of ordering a retreat. Kawabe subsequently became ill with dysentery and perhaps physically unfit for duty. He nevertheless ordered repeated attacks, stating later that Bose was the key to Japan's and India's future.|$|E

25|$|Ultimately, each {{relatively}} autonomous {{field of}} modern life, such as economy, politics, arts, journalism, bureaucracy, science or education engenders a specific complex {{of social relations}} where the agents will engage their everyday practice. Through this practice, they develop a certain disposition for social action that is conditioned by their position on the field (dominant/dominated and orthodox/heterodox are only two possible ways of positioning the agents on the field; these basic binary distinctions are always further analysed considering the specificities of each field). This disposition, combined with every other disposition the individual develops through his engagement with other fields operating within the social world, will eventually come to constitute a system of dispositions, known in Bourdieu's lexicon as a habitus. Dispositions - a key concept in Bourdieu's work - can be conceived as {{a sense of the}} game, a partly rational but partly intuitive understanding of fields and of social order in general, a practical sense, a practical reason, giving rise to opinions, tastes, <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>voice,</b> typical body movements and mannerisms and so on. The dispositions constitutive of habitus are therefore conditioned responses to the social world, becoming so ingrained that they come to occur spontaneously, rather like 'kneejerk' opinions. It follows that the habitus developed by an individual will typify his position in the social space. By doing so, social agents will often acknowledge, legitimate and reproduce the social forms of domination (including prejudices) and the common opinions of each field as self-evident, clouding from conscience and practice even the acknowledgment of other possible means of production (including symbolic production) and power relations.|$|E

500|$|... "Christmas Scandal" [...] {{was written}} by series co-founder Michael Schur and {{directed}} by Randall Einhorn. The episode featured {{the last of a}} string of guest performances by stand-up comedian Louis C.K., who reprised his recurring role as Dave Sanderson, Leslie's police officer boyfriend. Louis C.K. left the show to devote more time to his own upcoming series, Louie, which was to air in early 2010. Louis C.K. was widely praised for his brief stint on the show, where he adopts a deadpan, technical <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> far different from his usual comedy persona. Matt Fowler of IGN said, [...] "Louis C.K., known for being a raucous, raunchy comic, is almost frightening in his ability to play against his stage persona and give us a wonderfully caring, and deadpan, character".|$|E

[...] Something which both critics and Wade MacNeil himself have acknowledged is his distinct <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> from Frank Carter even to the point in which their fan base could be divided over the decision to have Wade in the band.

500|$|The {{second season}} also {{included}} several prominent guest appearances, something that distinguished Parks and Recreation from Greg Daniels' other comedy series, The Office. Schur said high-profile guests on The Office {{would be too}} distracting because most episodes are confined to one setting, while he said Parks and Recreation was [...] "a little bit more bright and colorful than The Office". Megan Mullally, the real-life wife of Nick Offerman, appeared as Ron's ex-wife Tammy in the episode [...] "Ron and Tammy". Schur said Mullally's appearance was well received and not overly distracting to viewers, which made the Parks and Recreation producers feel more comfortable about using future guest actors. Stand-up comedian Louis C.K. appeared in several episodes as Dave Sanderson, a Pawnee police officer and romantic interest to Leslie Knope. Although typically known for his raunchy and caustic comedy style, Louis C.K. adopted a far more deadpan {{sense of humor and}} technical <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> for Sanderson.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the senior}} dance, Tom invites his ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) {{to his office}} to finally {{disclose}} his romantic feelings for her, but she rejects him. Not satisfied with the outcome, he attempts to blackmail her into a date using an alimony lawsuit as leverage. Tom and Wendy are later shown hugging and presumably making amends, although their conversation remains inaudible. Meanwhile, April's (Aubrey Plaza) boyfriend Derek (Blake Lee) and his boyfriend Ben (Josh Duvendeck) mock the senior citizens, causing April to question why their interactions must constantly be [...] "cloaked in like 15 layers of irony". They accuse her of [...] "lameness", which they attribute to spending time with Andy, and provide her with several ultimatums. She breaks up with them in response. Ann (Rashida Jones) and Mark (Paul Schneider), at the same time, celebrate their first Valentine's Day together. In {{an interview with the}} camera crew, Ann describes the relationship as [...] "good", but her <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> and body language around Mark contradict her statements. She later becomes jealous when Andy dedicates a song to April, even {{going so far as to}} question April about the possibility of a budding relationship between April and Andy, to which April responds impatiently.|$|E
500|$|... "Migrate" [...] is an up-tempo hip hop club track. Lyrically, it {{is about}} the freedom and {{independence}} of a girls' night out. It documents Carey's whereabouts and where she migrates from and to: [...] "from the car to the club to the bar to the VIP lounge to the after-party to the hotel" [...] and contains a reference to Patrón, a brand of Mexican tequila. As the song is about movement from one place to another, T-Pain tells her to [...] "bounce" [...] in response. Carey displays a sense of [...] "confident, social forwardness" [...] on [...] "Migrate". Nick Levine of Digital Spy thought that Carey sounded her [...] "most diva-like" [...] on the song, with the references to champagne being [...] "compliments of the club" [...] while the DJ plays her [...] "jam". Melodically, Carey delivers the track over a [...] "repeating" [...] chorus backed by a [...] "descending echo-synth". It contains a reduced number of notes in order to further accentuate the hook. While Carey employs a [...] "sassy" [...] <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>voice,</b> both her and T-Pain's vocals are processed with Auto-Tune. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic thought that the use of Auto-Tune on Carey's vocals served a [...] "dual purpose", and explained that while it [...] "camouflages her slightly diminishing range" [...] it also made her sound [...] "modern". Ben Ratliff of The New York Times felt that T-Pain sounded more interesting than Carey despite the use of Auto-Tune.|$|E

500|$|Heywood {{opened his}} defence on 17 September {{with a long}} {{prepared}} statement read {{by one of his}} lawyers. It began with a frank acknowledgement of his predicament: to be even accused of mutiny was to [...] "appear at once the object of unpardonable guilt and exemplary vengeance". His case rested on a series of arguments which, as historian Caroline Alexander points out, are not wholly consistent. First, Heywood pleaded his [...] "extreme youth and inexperience" [...] as the cause of his failure to join Bligh and the loyalists in the open boat, insisting that [...] "...I was influenced in my Conduct by the Example of my Messmates, Mr. Hallet and Mr. Hayward ... the latter, tho' he had been many years at Sea, yet, when Christian ordered him into the Boat he was ... so much overcome by the harsh Command, that he actually shed tears." [...] Heywood then cited a different reason for staying aboard Bounty: Bligh's launch was overloaded, and its destruction would be assured [...] "by the least addition to their Number". Finally, Heywood maintained he had intended to join Bligh but had been stopped: [...] "...on hearing it suggested that I should be deem'd Guilty if I staid in the Ship, I went down directly, and in passing Mr. Cole told him in a low <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> that I would fetch a few necessaries in a Bag and follow him into the Boat, which at that time I meant to do but was afterwards prevented." ...|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Black Widower" [...] finished 39th in Nielsen {{ratings for the}} week of April 6–12, 1992, making The Simpsons the third-highest rated television series on the Fox network that week, after Married... with Children and In Living Color. In I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn wrote that he considered the episode a [...] "terrific show", appreciating Grammer's work in particular, and he also enjoyed the Dinosaurs gag and Bob's reaction to McGyver, which he remarked [...] "make the whole thing great fun". Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict rated the episode 97%, and considered it a [...] "timeless treat" [...] because of Sideshow Bob's appearance, calling it [...] "excellent from beginning to end". Nate Meyers of the website digitallyOBSESSED rated the episode 3 out of 5. He felt that the episode was [...] "not a strong entry to the series", noting that [...] "the love story between Bob and Selma never seems to play {{as well as it}} should". Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide remarked that later episodes of The Simpsons seasons were typically of lesser quality than episodes that appeared earlier in a season because of [...] "general tiredness and the pressure of creating so many programs". However, he found that [...] "Black Widower" [...] was an exception, noting that most episodes featuring Sideshow Bob rarely disappoint. Hock Guan Teh of DVD Town applauded Grammer's performance as Sideshow Bob in the episode, saying he could not [...] "get over Sideshow Bob´s evil and conniving <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>voice,</b> all delivered in a pseudo-Anglophile accent".|$|E
500|$|Each journal {{covers a}} {{different}} period of Mountstuart's life, {{and they are}} usually geographically named: The School Journal, London I, etc. Boyd varied the narrator's tone in each to demonstrate changes in Mountstuart's character. In the first London Journal he is, according to Boyd, a [...] "modernist aesthete", becoming a [...] "world-weary cynic" [...] in New York and finding [...] "serene and elegiac serenity" [...] in the final French journal. To support the book's historical themes and documentary premise, there is a feigned editorial apparatus: an index listing real people and their relation to Mountstuart alongside fictional characters, an editor's introduction (by Boyd), an authorial preface (by Mountstuart) {{and a list of}} works attributed to Mountstuart. An additional stylistic feature is the anonymous editor (Boyd), who introduces the book and offers explanatory footnotes, cross-references and attempts at dating. Since a journal is written from the perspective of each day, Mountstuart's moods change as events affect him. The form lends itself to [...] "plotlessness", since the author/narrator inevitably cannot see the overall structure of the story. Plot lines which [...] "fizzle and fade" [...] emphasise the theme of multiple selves throughout life. Boyd adds other aspects to the work, such as parenthetical musings that are never answered, to re-enforce the style. His <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> gradually changes as he ages: Boyd wanted the style to reflect the major theme that we change and grow throughout life: [...] "I wanted the literary tone of each journal to reflect this and so the voice subtly changes as you read on: from pretentious school boy to modern young decadent, to bitter realist to drink soaked cynic, to sage and serene octogenarian, and so forth." ...|$|E
