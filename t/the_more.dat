5|$|Also, whilst {{productivity}} {{figures have}} improved, median incomes and stock market prices, {{and thus the}} returns to capital and labor, have not improved. Furthermore, government consumption (government activity excluding transfer payments) represents between 15–20% of GDP, but since the sector is measured at cost it becomes less and less productive as it grows larger. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> government consumption there is, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> published GDP figures tend to overestimate growth in living standards.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the paucity}} of {{surviving}} attributed works, {{it is difficult to}} detect any evolution in Lochner's style.

40|$|I examine here how Sumner’s {{concept of}} <b>the</b> <b>mores</b> applies to modern urban society&mdash;in {{particular}} to law as an epiphenomenon of <b>the</b> <b>mores</b> {{rather than an}} influence on them. Strongly-held mores are rare in contem-porary societies. Rather, submores pervade, causing conflict among antag-onistic interests. Law can sometimes bridge these submores, as in labor-management conflict. Law can also provide a framework within which pervasive mores may evolve. For these reasons, law can and does contribute much <b>more</b> to <b>the</b> <b>mores</b> of complex urban societies than Sumner perceived. 1 ntroduction William Graham Sumner, the great Yale sociologist, influ-enced generations of social scientists by his view of law as an epiphenomenon (Sumner 1906 : 53, 209), a position partially em-bodied by his disciples in the resounding metaphor, &dquo;law nm-ning counter to <b>the</b> <b>mores</b> cannot stand. &dquo; The master himself put it this way: &dquo;Acts of legislation come out of <b>the</b> <b>mores</b> [...] Legislation [...] . has to seek standing ground on the exist...|$|R

5|$|For giant stars, the {{atmospheric}} microturbulence {{can result in}} line broadening that is much larger than effects of rotational, effectively drowning out the signal.

5|$|Lactarius vinosus, {{formerly}} {{considered a}} variety of L.sanguifluus, is quite similar in appearance. In general, L.vinosus can be distinguished by <b>the</b> <b>more</b> vinaceous-red color (lacking orange tones) of its cap, stipe, and gills, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> distinctly downwards-tapered stipe, and <b>the</b> <b>more</b> intense staining of the latex on the cap tissue. The two species can also be distinguished microscopically by differences in the ornamentation of their spore surfaces. L.vinosus has an incomplete reticulum on the spore surface, with ridges that have a wider degree of variation in thickness. Another potential lookalike, L.semisanguifluus, has a characteristic orange latex that turns wine-red in 5–10 minutes after exposure to air. Compared to L.sanguifluus, the fruit bodies of L.semisanguifluus are smaller, have tinges of violet in the cap, and develop a greenish discolouration with age.|$|E
