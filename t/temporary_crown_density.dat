The weather parameters above the fuel surface used in Catchpole's existing Direct Estimation Model are not suitable for forecast. The <b>crown</b> <b>density</b> of the forest area in the model, which may has great influence to the fine fuel moisture content in the forest, is not considered. A series of outdoor experiments were carried out in order to study the effect of the <b>crown</b> <b>density,</b> including 3 simulated <b>crown</b> <b>densities</b> and 2 real tests. In the experiments, the collected Pinus Sylvestris needles in the Da Hinggan Mountains of China are used. The dynamic variations of the weights of the needles are captured in 0. 5 h or 1 h interval, and the dry weights of them are measured after 24 h kiln dry. During the experiments, the local meteorological data including the temperature, the humidity and the winds velocity, are recorded from the homepage of Weather China at the same time. Based on the experiments, a modified model for fine fuel moisture content prediction is achieved, in which the <b>crown</b> <b>density</b> is used to adjust the temperature and the humidity near the fuel surface. The comparison results show that under different conditions of <b>crown</b> <b>densities,</b> the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the modified model are decreased significantly, and the Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPE) for different <b>crown</b> <b>densities</b> are all less than 6 %.

The study included (1) geometric corrections, (2) radiometric and atmospheric correction, (3) noise corrections using exclusion of neighboring pixels and filtering methods, and (4) establishment of models and estimation lmages. The Universal Transverse Mercator coordinates of the field plots derived from digital analysis of the photographs were converted into the line/pixel coordinate system of the TM scenes. The corresponding pixels valued in TM 3 scenes were selected and transformed into data files. The correlation between the rates of conifer <b>crown</b> <b>densities</b> analyzed from digitalized photographs and stand reflectance values in the TM bands and vegetation indices were carried out in order to find the most suitable variables and methods for <b>crown</b> <b>density</b> estimations.

It was shown that tree <b>crown</b> <b>density</b> did not significantly influence the abundance of litter macrofauna and the abundance of litter invertebrates. The Shannon and Pielou diversity indexes have a tendency to raise the gradient of tree <b>crown</b> <b>density</b> (from 50 % to 90 – 100 %). The relative abundance of saprophages and zoophages reached its minimum (median was 18 % and 3 %, respectively) in forest sites with sparse crown cover, and, at the level of tendency, was higher in dense forests with a closed crown (median was 40 % and 18 %, respectively). The relative abundance of polyphages, on the contrary, was lower in these conditions (82 % in sparse and 27 % in closed crown cover). The number of species in each trophic group did not significantly change in relation to tree <b>crown</b> <b>density.</b> At sites with 70 – 79 % tree <b>crown</b> <b>density</b> the size structure of the litter macrofauna was close to its optimal condition. The relative abundance of ants reached its maximum (median 73 %) in sparsely timbered sites (up to 50 % tree <b>crown</b> <b>density),</b> the relative share of Isopoda reached its maximum (median 40 %) at sites with average <b>crown</b> <b>density</b> (50 – 59 %). At densely wooded sites the taxonomic structure at the level of order and family was more or less level, without clearly dominant groups, each order and family occupying about 15 % {{of the total number of}} macrofauna. The relative abundance of the majority of orders and families did not significantly vary in response to different levels of tree <b>crown</b> <b>density.</b> The influence of herbaceous layer cover on macrofauna was in general less than that of tree <b>crown</b> <b>density.</b> The abundance of litter macrofauna in deciduous forests reached its maximum at sites with the two extreme variants of herbaceous layer cover: sparse herbaceous cover (up to 15 %) and dense herbaceous cover (over 90 %). The minimal abundance of litter macrofauna was observed at sites with average herbaceous layer density (45 – 59 %). The number of species and the Shannon and Pielou diversity indexes did not vary significantly in relation to changes in herbaceous layer density in deciduous forests of the steppe zone of Ukraine. The number of phtyophage species was higher at sites with average values for herbaceous layer density, while the number of saprophage, zoophage and polyphage species did not significantly change. The dominance structure of litter macrofauna was maximally transformed at sites with the extreme variants of herbaceous layer cover: sparse herbaceous cover (up to 15 %) and dense herbaceous cover (over 90 %). The median number of ground beetle species reached its maximum at sites with 15 – 29 % herbaceous layer cover. The median of the relative abundance of ground beetles did not significantly change relative to the extent of herbaceous layer cover.

Abutments were obtained from the crowns, while the radicular part was sectioned in order to insert a thermocouple into the pulpal chamber. During the experiment the tooth with the polymerising resin was put into an oral cavity simulator to keep a constant temperature. The thermal increase during polymerisation of the 2 resins was recorded for 6 minutes at 5 seconds intervals and with 1 and 2. 5 mm dentin thickness (n = 10).

40|$|Vegetation {{structure}} in water-limited systems is {{to a large}} degree controlled by ecohydrological processes, including mean annual precipitation (MAP) modulated by the characteristics of precipitation and geomorphology that collectively determine how rainfall is distributed vertically into soils or horizontally in the landscape. We anticipate that woody canopy cover, <b>crown</b> <b>density,</b> <b>crown</b> size, and the level of spatial aggregation among woody plants in the landscape will vary across environmental gradients. A high level of woody plant aggregation is most distinct in periodic vegetation patterns (PVPs), which emerge as a result of ecohydrological processes such as runoff generation and increased infiltration close to plants. Similar, albeit weaker, forces may influence the spatial distribution of woody plants elsewhere in savannas. Exploring these trends can extend our knowledge of how semi-arid vegetation structure is constrained by rainfall regime, soil type, topography, and disturbance processes such as fire. Using high-spatial-resolution imagery, a flexible classification framework, and a crown delineation method, we extracted woody vegetation properties from 876  sites spread over African savannas. At each site, we estimated woody cover, mean <b>crown</b> size, <b>crown</b> <b>density,</b> and the degree of aggregation among woody plants. This enabled us to elucidate the effects of rainfall regimes (MAP and seasonality), soil texture, slope, and fire frequency on woody vegetation properties. We found that previously documented increases in woody cover with rainfall is more consistently a result of increasing crown size than increasing density of woody plants.

METHODS: 180 specimens {{were made of}} Duralay and randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 30) according to surface treatment and bonding material: G 1 - surface roughening with Soflex and bonding with Duralay; G 2 - roughening with aluminum oxide blasting and bonding with Duralay; G 3 - application of monomer and bonding with Duralay; G 4 - roughening with Soflex and bonding with Transbond XT; G 5 - roughening with aluminum oxide blasting and bonding with Transbond XT and G 6 : application of monomer and bonding with Transbond. The results were statistically assessed by ANOVA/Games-Howell. RESULTS: The means (MPa) were: G 1 = 18. 04, G 2 = 22. 64, G 3 = 22. 4, G 4 = 9. 71, G 5 = 11. 23, G 6 = 9. 67.
