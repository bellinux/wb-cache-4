PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server software combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>data,</b> including images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with a command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to implement standalone graphical applications.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{was later}} {{introduced}} {{to amend the}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> collected and stored in the National Register of Electors. On 17 May 2007, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada Jennifer Stoddart appeared before the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs regarding Bill C-31, An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the Public Service Employment Act submitting a letter in which she criticised the proposed changes to the Elections Act. One of the problems was the inclusion of an elector's date of birth in the voter lists sent to polling stations on election day for use by polling clerks and scrutineers; Stoddart stated that verification of an elector's birth year would be sufficient. The second problem she raised was inclusion of the date of birth in the voter lists sent to each candidate for all electoral districts in Canada, and also to all political parties.|$|E

25|$|Further, {{the data}} is often taken {{to be in an}} array, which allows random access, rather than a list, which only allows {{sequential}} access, though often algorithms can be applied with suitable modification to either <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E
25|$|SBML allows {{models of}} {{arbitrary}} complexity to be represented.

25|$|The method {{begins with}} a {{database}} of features to be compared, with software making the comparisons. The results largely depend on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> selected and the method of comparison. The Polynesian Lexicon (POLLEX) Project, begun in 1965 by Bruce Biggs, primarily uses lexical data. By comparing words from the Oceanic languages collected in the lexicon, it assesses the levels of proto-language on the phylogenetic tree.|$|E
25|$|Mixed {{models are}} widely used to analyze linear {{regression}} relationships involving dependent data when the dependencies have a known structure. Common applications of mixed models include analysis of data involving repeated measurements, such as longitudinal data, or data obtained from cluster sampling. They are generally fit as parametric models, using maximum likelihood or Bayesian estimation. In the case where the errors are modeled as normal random variables, there is a close connection between mixed models and generalized least squares. Fixed effects estimation is an alternative approach to analyzing this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a sheaf is a {{tool for}} {{systematically}} tracking locally defined data attached to the open sets of a topological space. The data can be restricted to smaller open sets, and the data assigned to an open set is equivalent to all collections of compatible data assigned to collections of smaller open sets covering the original one. For example, such data can consist of the rings of continuous or smooth real-valued functions defined on each open set. Sheaves are by design quite general and abstract objects, and their correct definition is rather technical. They are variously defined, for example, as sheaves of sets or sheaves of rings, depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> assigned to open sets.|$|E

These instructions can also define whether the data is available to outside programs (programs assembled separately) or only to the program in which the data section is defined. Some assemblers classify these as pseudo-ops.|$|E

2500|$|Sampling {{of water}} for {{physical}} or chemical testing {{can be done by}} several methods, depending on the accuracy needed and the characteristics of the contaminant. Many contamination events are sharply restricted in time, most commonly in association with rain events. For this reason [...] "grab" [...] samples are often inadequate for fully quantifying contaminant levels. Scientists gathering this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> often employ auto-sampler devices that pump increments of water at either time or discharge intervals.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the term}} spyware {{suggests}} software that monitors a user's computing, {{the functions of}} spyware can extend beyond simple monitoring. [...] Spyware can collect almost any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>data,</b> including personal information like internet surfing habits, user logins, and bank or credit account information. [...] Spyware can also interfere with a user's control of a computer by installing additional software or redirecting web browsers. Some spyware can change computer settings, which can result in slow Internet connection speeds, un-authorized changes in browser settings, or changes to software settings.|$|E
