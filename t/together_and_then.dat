5|$|Termite alates only {{leave the}} colony when a nuptial flight takes place. Alate {{males and females}} pair up <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> land {{in search of a}} {{suitable}} place for a colony. A termite king and queen do not mate until they find such a spot. When they do, they excavate a chamber big enough for both, close up the entrance and proceed to mate. After mating, the pair never go outside and spend {{the rest of their lives}} in the nest. Nuptial flight time varies in each species. For example, alates in certain species emerge during the day in summer while others emerge during the winter. The nuptial flight may also begin at dusk, when the alates swarm around areas with lots of lights. The time when nuptial flight begins depends on the environmental conditions, the time of day, moisture, wind speed and precipitation. The number of termites in a colony also varies, with the larger species typically having 100–1,000 individuals. However, some termite colonies, including those with large individuals, can number in the millions.|$|E

25|$|This {{problem is}} {{frequently}} solved by staging— the rocket sheds excess weight (usually empty tankage and associated engines) during launch. Staging is either serial where the rockets light after the previous stage has fallen away, or parallel, where rockets are burning <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> detach when they burn out.|$|E

25|$|In {{conventional}} pointe shoes, the box {{is typically}} made from tightly packed layers of paper and fabric that have been glued <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> shaped into an enclosure. When the glue dries, it becomes hard and provides the required stiffness. In some newer pointe shoes, the box may be made from plastic and rubber, with rigidity provided by the plastic.|$|E
25|$|In {{existing}} properties, tenants may form {{a housing}} cooperative <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> make {{an offer to}} the owner to buy the property. When such a cooperative has been formed, it automatically becomes the first prospective buyer should the owner desire to sell. The acquisition is financed {{by a combination of}} equity (i.e. the 'stakes' paid by the members) and bank loans.|$|E
25|$|The {{warships}} of {{the time}} were not designed to be ship killers but rather troop carriers. It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel, lashing the two ships <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> boarding the enemy craft. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.|$|E

25|$|This {{reaction}} can be catalyzed by {{a variety}} of substances. The most commonly used catalyst is a mixture of potassium chloride and aluminum chloride. However, various forms of porous carbon can also be used. This reaction produces tetrachloroethylene as a byproduct, and depending on the amount of chlorine fed to the reaction, tetrachloroethylene can even be the major product. Typically, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are collected <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> separated by distillation.|$|E
25|$|In 1841, Treaty documents, {{housed in}} an iron box, {{narrowly}} escaped damage {{when the government}} offices at Official Bay in Auckland were destroyed by fire. They disappeared from sight until 1865 when a Native Department officer worked on them in Wellington {{at the request of}} parliament and produced an erroneous list of signatories.

25|$|The Abadha of Lingaraj Temple and Ananta Vasudeva Temple {{served for}} devotees is {{considered}} a vegetarian culinary delight. Other vegetarian dishes are Dalma (made of lentils and vegetables boiled <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> fried with other spices) and Santula (lightly spiced steamed vegetables). Sweets play a large part in the diet of Bhubaneswarites—especially at their social ceremonies. Bhubaneswar {{is known for its}} kora-khhaii which are made up of paddy, jaggery and coconut pieces. Pitha, a kind of sweet cake, bread or dim sum are winter specialties.|$|E
25|$|Floral (millefiori) and spiral patterns: This was {{produced}} by binding rods of coloured glass together and heating and fusing them into a single piece. These were then cut in cross-section, and the resulting discs could be fused together to create complex patterns. Alternately, two strips of contrasting-coloured glass could be fused <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> wound round a glass rod whilst still hot to produce a spiral pattern. Cross-sections of this were also cut, and could be {{fused together to form}} a plate or fused to plain glass.|$|E
25|$|A {{large portion}} of Japanese {{interior}} walls are often made of shōji screens that can be pushed open to join two rooms <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> close them allowing more privacy. The shōji screens are made of paper attached to thin wooden frames that roll away on a track when they are pushed. Another important feature of the shōji screen, besides privacy and seclusion, is that they allow light through. This is an important aspect to Japanese design. Paper translucent walls allow light to be diffused through the space and create light shadows and patterns.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} grind {{telescope}} optics into an accurate shape, a highly versatile material {{must be used}} such as glass. The amateur casting process is usually done through a temperature controlled glass fusing kiln, in which layers or chunks of glass (usually plate or borosilicate glass) are stacked on top of or around each other within a round mold specified to aperture size. After the melting point is reached, the glass fuses <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the annealing process begins. Proper annealing procedures ensure that internal stresses are relieved within the glass, which reduces risk of failure for the newly cast blank.|$|E
25|$|When {{different}} {{materials are}} brought <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> separated, {{an accumulation of}} electric charge can occur which leaves one material positively charged while the other becomes negatively charged. The mild shock that you receive when touching a grounded object after walking on carpet {{is an example of}} excess electrical charge accumulating in your body from frictional charging between your shoes and the carpet. The resulting charge build-up upon your body can generate a strong electrical discharge. Although experimenting with static electricity may be fun, similar sparks create severe hazards in those industries dealing with flammable substances, where a small electrical spark may ignite explosive mixtures with devastating consequences.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} {{began when}} no score was registered on the scoreboard. For {{half an hour}} gymnastics stole the screen {{from all the other}} sports and even the adverts on Western TV stations were delayed. Deductions were taken in tenths by the judges, i.e. 0 if the judge thought the exercise was perfect, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 etc. The marks were 10 from the Bulgarian judge, 9.9 from the Czech judge, 9.8 from both the Soviet and Polish judges. With the top and bottom marks being discarded, and the remaining two being added <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> divided by two, this gave Nadia Comăneci a score of 9.85. This gave her a shared silver with Maxi Gnauck. Natalia Shaposhnikova finished 4th but would have shared a silver medal with them had she scored 0.05 extra.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the assault Muhammad b. 'Abdallah gathered his commanders <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> sent men to the gates all along {{the western side of}} the city. The reinforcements engaged the Samarrans and, after killing a large number of them, forced them back to the gateways. Fighting continued until the late afternoon, with the defenders finally managing to expel the Samarrans from the gates and forcing them to flee back to their camp. The areas in the wall where the Samarrans had broken through were ordered repaired. The assault on {{the eastern side of the}} city also failed, as the Baghdadis were able to force the attackers back. As with the fighting on the western side, many Baghdadi and Samarran soldiers were killed in the battle for the Shammasiyyah Gate. The assault having therefore failed, the Samarrans returned to their siege positions.|$|E
25|$|An air-wedge {{shearing}} interferometer {{is described}} in and was employed in set of experiments described in. This interferometer consists of two optical glass wedges (~2-5deg), pushed <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> slightly separated {{from one side to}} create a thin air-gap wedge. This air-gap wedge has a unique property- it is very thin (micrometer scale) and it has perfect flatness (~λ/10). There are four nearly equal intensity Fresnel reflections (~4% for refraction coefficient 1.5) from the air-wedge interferometer (Fig.1): 1-2 from the first glass wedge, and 3-4 from the second one. The angle between beams 1-2 and 3-4 is non adjustable and depends only on the glass wedge. The angle between beams 2-3 is easily adjusted by varying the air-wedge angle. The distance between the air-wedge and an image plane should be long enough to spatially separate reflections 1 from 2 and 3 from 4. The overlap of beams 2 and 3 in the image plane creates an interferogram.|$|E
25|$|In October 1601, {{the long-awaited}} aid from Spain {{appeared}} {{in the form of}} an army} under Don Juan de Aguila, which occupied the town of Kinsale in the extreme south of the country. Mountjoy rushed to contain the Spanish, while O'Neill and O'Donnell were compelled to hazard their armies in separate marches from the north, through territories defended by Sir George Carew, in the depths of a severe winter. They gained little support en route. At Bandon they joined <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> blockaded the English army that was laying siege to the Spanish. The English were in a poor state, with many of their troops disabled with dysentery, and the extreme winter weather made life in camp very difficult. But owing to poor communications with the besieged Spanish and a crucial failure to withstand the shock of a daring English cavalry charge, O'Neill's army was quickly dispersed. The Irish army retreated, and the Spanish commander surrendered. The defeat at the battle of Kinsale was a disaster for O'Neill and ended his chances of winning the war.|$|E
