30|$|In {{the final}} step of PRISM, a 2 D output is {{produced}} for each probe position by applying coefficients, one for each plane wave, to {{the elements of the}} compact S-matrix and summing along the dimension corresponding to the different plane waves. These coefficients correspond to Fourier phase shifts that scale and translate each plane wave to the relevant location on the sample in real space. The phase coefficients, which are different for each plane wave but constant for a given probe position, are precomputed and stored in global memory. Each threadblock on the device first reads the coefficients from global memory into shared memory, where they can be reused throughout the lifetime of the threadblock. Components of the compact S-matrix for a given output wave position are then read from global memory, multiplied by the relevant coefficient, and stored in fast shared memory, where the remaining summation is performed. This parallel sum-reduction is performed using a number of well-established optimization techniques including reading multiple global values per <b>thread,</b> <b>loop</b> unrolling through template specialization, and foregoing of synchronization primitives when the calculation has been reduced to the single-warp level [47]. Once the real space exit-wave has been computed, the modulus squared of its FFT yields the calculation result at the detector plane.|$|E

Conclusions. SILS technique is feasible for obese patients, uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis as well as for exploratory laparoscopy. Most common methods to ligate appendix are feasible with SILS technique. The true benefit of the technique should be assessed by randomised controlled trials...|$|E
5000|$|An {{overlock}} {{is a kind}} of stitch that sews {{over the}} edge of one or two pieces of cloth for edging, hemming, or seaming. Usually an overlock sewing machine will cut the edges of the cloth as they are fed through (such machines being called [...] "sergers" [...] in North America), though some are made without cutters. The inclusion of automated cutters allows overlock machines to create finished seams easily and quickly. An overlock sewing machine differs from a lockstitch sewing machine in that it uses loopers fed by multiple thread cones rather than a bobbin. Loopers serve to create <b>thread</b> <b>loops</b> that pass from the needle thread to the edges of the fabric so that the edges of the fabric are contained within the seam.|$|R
40|$|When {{parallel}} {{programs are}} executed on multiprocessors with private caches, {{a set of}} data may be repeatedly used and modified by different threads. Such data sharing can often result in cache thrashing which degrades the memory performance. This paper presents and evaluates a method to eliminate or reduce such cache thrashing due to true data sharing in nested parallel loops. With this method, the staggering relation and compacting relation are determined and accordingly the nested loop are restructured at compile time. Due to its simplicity, the method can be efficiently implemented in any parallel compiler. Experimental results show quite significant performance improvement over existing static and dynamic scheduling methods.

40|$|Abstract. Supercurrents in superconducting flux <b>threaded</b> <b>loops</b> are {{expected}} to oscillate with the magnetic flux with a period of hc/ 2 e. This is indeed true for s-wave superconductors larger than the coherence length ξ 0. Here we show that for superconductors with gap nodes, {{there is no such}} strict condition for the supercurrent to be hc/ 2 e rather than hc/e periodic. For nodal superconductors, the flux induced Doppler shift of the near nodal states leads to a flux dependent occupation probability of quasi-particles circulating clockwise and counter clockwise around the loop, which leads to an hc/e periodic component of the supercurrent, even at zero temperature. We analyze this phenomenon on a cylinder in an approximative analytic approach and also numerically {{within the framework of the}} BCS theory. Specifically for d-wave pairing, we show that the hc/e periodic current component decreases with the inverse radius of the loop and investigate its temperature dependence...|$|R
5000|$|Overlock {{stitching}} {{was invented}} by the Merrow Machine Company in 1881.J. Makens Merrow and his son Joseph Merrow, who owned a knitting mill established in Connecticut in 1838, developed a number of technological advancements {{to be used in}} the mill’s operations. Merrow's first patent was a machine for crochet stitching, and the Merrow Machine Company still produces crochet machines based on this original model. This technology was a starting point for the development of the overlock machine, patented by Joseph Merrow in 1889. Unlike standard lockstitching, which uses a bobbin, overlock sewing machines utilize loopers to create <b>thread</b> <b>loops</b> for the needle to pass through, in a manner similar to crocheting. Merrow's original three-thread overedge sewing machine is the forerunner of contemporary overlocking machines. Over time, the Merrow Machine Company pioneered the design of new machines to create a variety of overlock stitches, such as two- and four-thread machines, the one-thread butted seam, and the cutterless emblem edger.|$|R

Jrpm {{is based on}} a chip multiprocessor (CMP) with thread-level speculation (TLS) support. CMPs have low sharing and communication costs relative to traditional multt) rocessors, and thread-level speculation (TLS) simplifies program parallelization by allowing us to parallelize optimistically without violating correct sequential program behavior. Using a Java virtual machine with dynamic compilation support coupled with a hardware profiler, speculative buffer requirements and inter-thread dependencies of prospective speculative <b>thread</b> <b>loops</b> (STLs) are analyzed in real-time to identi the best loops to parallelize. Once sufficient data has been collected to make a reasonable decision, selected loops are dynamically recompiled to run in parallel Experimental results demonstrate that Jrpm can exploit thread-level parallelism with minimal effort from the programmer. On four processors, we achieved speedups of 3 to 4 for floating point applications, to 3 on multimedia applications, and between 1. 5 and. 5 on integer applications. Performance was achieved by automatic selection of thread decompositions by the hardware profiler, intra-procedural optimizations on code compiled dynamically into speculative threads, and some minor programmer transformations for exposing parallelism that cannot be performed automatically...|$|R
