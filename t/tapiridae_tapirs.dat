50|$|Members of {{the order}} Perissodactyla, {{otherwise}} known as odd-toed ungulates, are mammals characterized by an odd number of toes and by hindgut fermentation with somewhat simple stomachs. Perissodactyla comes from the Ancient Greek περισσός (perissós, “uneven”) + δάκτυλος (dáktulos, “a finger, toe”). Unlike the even-toed ungulates, they digest plant cellulose in their intestines rather than {{in one or more}} stomach chambers. The order includes three extant families: Equidae (horses, asses, and zebras), Rhinocerotidae (rhinoceroses), and <b>Tapiridae</b> (<b>tapirs),</b> with a total of about 17 species. Despite their very different appearances, they were recognized as related families in the 19th century by the zoologist Richard Owen, who also coined the order name.|$|E

5|$|The horse {{adapted to}} survive in areas of wide-open terrain with sparse vegetation, {{surviving}} in an ecosystem where other large grazing animals, especially ruminants, could not. Horses and other equids are odd-toed ungulates of the order Perissodactyla, a group of mammals that was dominant during the Tertiary period. In the past, this order contained 14families, but only three—Equidae (the horse and related species), <b>Tapiridae</b> (the <b>tapir),</b> and Rhinocerotidae (the rhinoceroses)—have survived to the present day.|$|R
