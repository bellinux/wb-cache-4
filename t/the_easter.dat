5|$|Bede's {{work as a}} hagiographer, and his {{detailed}} {{attention to}} dating, were both useful preparations for the task of writing the Historia Ecclesiastica.

5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{part of his}} life, Yeats {{was a member of}} the Irish Republican Brotherhood.

50|$|Finland {{was part}} of Sweden until 1809 when it became the {{autonomous}} Grand Duchy of Finland within the Russian Empire due to the Finnish War. Until 1866, Finland continued to observe <b>the</b> astronomical <b>Easter,</b> which was one week after <b>the</b> Gregorian <b>Easter</b> in 1818, 1825, 1829 and 1845. However, Russia then used the Julian calendar and Julian <b>Easter</b> so <b>the</b> comparison given above applies: that <b>the</b> astronomical <b>Easter</b> agreed with <b>the</b> Julian <b>Easter</b> about every third year but was sometimes earlier than March 22 in the Julian calendar.|$|R

5|$|After he had {{recorded}} his orchestration of the chorale prelude Christ lag in Todesbanden, BWV718, in 1931, Leopold Stokowski recorded his arrangement for symphonic orchestra of BWV4's fourth movement in 1937. As Chorale from <b>the</b> <b>Easter</b> cantata Christ lag in Todesbanden the arrangement's score was copyrighted in 1950 {{and published by}} Broude Brothers.

50|$|<b>The</b> Sundays between <b>Easter</b> and Pentecost have Latin names, {{derived from}} the {{beginning}} of the prescribed readings. The first Sunday after Easter is called Quasimodogeniti.

2500|$|The week {{beginning}} with Easter Sunday is called <b>Easter</b> Week or <b>the</b> Octave of <b>Easter,</b> {{and each day}} is prefaced with [...] "Easter", e.g. Easter Monday, Easter Tuesday, etc. Easter Saturday is therefore <b>the</b> Saturday after <b>Easter</b> Sunday. <b>The</b> day before <b>Easter</b> is properly called Holy Saturday. Eastertide, or Paschaltide, <b>the</b> season of <b>Easter,</b> begins on Easter Sunday and lasts until the day of Pentecost, seven weeks later.|$|R

5|$|Although the Georgian Chronicles {{maintain}} that David died in 1001, several Armenian and Muslim accounts suggest {{he may have}} died in 1000. Aristakes gives the date of David’s death as March 28, 1000, which is closely corroborated by another Armenian chronicler Asoghik who says David died on <b>the</b> <b>Easter</b> {{day of the year}} 449 of the Armenian calendar, i.e., March 31, 1000. Yet another Armenian, Samuel Anetsi, also puts the date as 1000.|$|E
5|$|As {{far as we}} know, the {{earliest}} cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach were performed in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131 (a psalm setting), and <b>the</b> <b>Easter</b> chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4.|$|E
5|$|As many as 90 sorties a {{day were}} called in to {{suppress}} North Vietnamese forces around Hambleton. In contrast, prior to <b>the</b> <b>Easter</b> Offensive, the number of daily sorties was about 10, and during the action, peaked at about 300. During the multi-day effort to rescue the men, the Americans hit the North Vietnamese with over 800 air strikes in direct support of the rescue. Search and rescue took priority over almost all strike targets.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Sundays between <b>Easter</b> and Pentecost have Latin names, {{derived from}} the {{beginning}} of the prescribed readings.

50|$|In South Tyrol and in {{the small}} village of Krimml in Austria, the {{so-called}} Osterfochaz (in Krimml Fochiz) is <b>the</b> traditional <b>Easter</b> gift of <b>the</b> Godparents to their Godchildren.

5|$|As {{the year}} progressed, Calvin and Farel's {{reputation}} with the council began to suffer. The council {{was reluctant to}} enforce the subscription requirement, as only a few citizens had subscribed to their confession of faith. On 26 November, the two ministers hotly debated the council over the issue. Furthermore, France was taking an interest in forming an alliance with Geneva and as the two ministers were Frenchmen, councillors had begun to question their loyalty. Finally, a major ecclesiastical-political quarrel developed when the city of Bern, Geneva's ally in the reformation of the Swiss churches, proposed to introduce uniformity in the church ceremonies. One proposal required the use of unleavened bread for the Eucharist. The two ministers were unwilling to follow Bern's lead and delayed {{the use of such}} bread until a synod in Zurich could be convened to make the final decision. The council ordered Calvin and Farel to use unleavened bread for <b>the</b> <b>Easter</b> Eucharist. In protest, they refused to administer communion during <b>the</b> <b>Easter</b> service. This caused a riot during the service and the next day, the council told Farel and Calvin to leave Geneva.|$|E
5|$|David left London in March, {{arriving}} in Rome just before <b>the</b> <b>Easter</b> celebrations. She toured the country, watching cooks {{at home and}} in restaurants and making extensive notes on the regional differences in the cuisine. While in Rome she met the painter Renato Guttuso; deeply impressed by his work, particularly his still lifes, she asked if he would illustrate her book. To her surprise he agreed and, while considering the fee of £60 absurdly low, he kept to his word and produced a series of illustrations.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} period, the North Vietnamese were {{recovering}} from losses incurred during <b>the</b> <b>Easter</b> Offensive of 1972 by replacing personnel and modernizing their equipment. Weapons improvement {{was due to}} a new influx of Soviet and Chinese military aid. During 1973, North Vietnam received 2.8million metric tons of goods (worth $330million) from communist-bloc countries, a 50 {{percent increase over the}} previous year. In 1974 that total increased to 3.5million metric tons ($400million) (according to CIA), while the South's aid was slashed to only $965 million per year, down from $2.2 billion.|$|E
50|$|After the {{adoption}} of the Gregorian solar calendar in 1753, three astronomical Easter dates were one week later than <b>the</b> Gregorian <b>Easter</b> in 1802, 1805 and 1818. Before Sweden formally adopted <b>the</b> Gregorian <b>Easter</b> in 1844, two more should have been delayed in 1825 and 1829 but were not.|$|R
50|$|In the Latin Rite of Catholicism, Anglican {{and other}} Western churches, <b>Easter</b> Week is <b>the</b> week {{beginning}} with the Christian feast of Easter and ending a week later on <b>Easter</b> Saturday. <b>The</b> term is sometimes inaccurately used to mean <b>the</b> week before <b>Easter,</b> which is properly known as Holy Week, and particularly confusing {{in this context is}} the secular misuse of <b>the</b> term <b>Easter</b> Saturday to refer to the day known liturgically as Holy Saturday or <b>Easter</b> Eve (<b>the</b> day before <b>Easter),</b> rather than <b>the</b> Saturday following <b>Easter.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Gregorian {{calendar}} has a lunisolar calendar, {{which is}} used to determine <b>the</b> date of <b>Easter.</b> <b>The</b> rules are in the Computus.|$|R
