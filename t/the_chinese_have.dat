5|$|Bristle {{toothbrush}}: According to a Library of Congress website, <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>have</b> {{used the}} bristle toothbrush since 1498, {{during the reign}} of the Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1487–1505) of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644); it also adds that the toothbrush was not mass-produced until 1780, when they were sold by a William Addis of Clerkenwell, London, England. In accordance with the Library of Congress website, scholar John Bowman also writes that the bristle toothbrush using pig bristles was invented in China during the 1490s. While Bonnie L. Kendall agrees with this, she noted that a predecessor existed in ancient Egypt {{in the form of a}} twig that was frayed at the end.|$|E
5|$|As of the 2010 Malaysian census, the {{population}} of the town of Bintulu is 114,058. Indigenous people accounted for the largest proportion of the town population (61.2%, 69,782), followed by Chinese (25.0%, 28,512), Non-Malaysians (13.1%, 14,939), and Indians (0.3%, 319). Among the indigenous groups, there are Iban (32,992), Malay (14,945), Melanau (14,179), Bidayuh (1,598), and other indigenous tribes (6,068). According to government sources, there are 229 Iban longhouses in the Bintulu District. The Ibans moved into Kemena and Tatau basins in the mid-19th and early 20th century with permission of the Brooke government. Other indigenous tribes that form the minority are Kayan, Kenyah, and Punan. The Chinese in Bintulu are mainly composed of dialect groups such as Hakka, Fuzhou, and Teochews. <b>The</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>have</b> been living in the town of Tatau since the era of Bruneian Empire. Later, Fuzhou Chinese from Sibu moved in, dominating the timber and plantation businesses in Bintulu. There is also a large number of foreigners working there. Most of them come from Britain, Australia, the Netherlands, Germany, South Africa, New Zealand, Japan, China, the United States, and Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|Other {{minorities}} lack bumiputera status. 24.6 {{per cent}} of the population are of Chinese descent, while those of Indian descent comprise 7.3 per {{cent of the}} population. <b>The</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>have</b> historically been dominant {{in the business and}} commerce community, and form a plurality of the population of Penang. Immigrants from India, the majority of them Tamils, began arriving in Malaysia early in the 19th century. Malaysian citizenship is not automatically granted to those born in Malaysia, but is granted to a child born of two Malaysian parents outside Malaysia. Dual citizenship is not permitted. Citizenship in the states of Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo are distinct from citizenship in Peninsular Malaysia for immigration purposes. Every citizen is issued a biometric smart chip identity card known as MyKad at the age of 12, and must carry the card at all times.|$|E

The Spaniards restricted the activities of the Chinese and confined them to the Parián which was located near Intramuros. Most of the Chinese residents earned their livelihood as traders.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>have</b> been {{settling}} in Malaysia for many centuries, and form the second-largest ethnic group. The first Chinese {{to settle in}} the Straits Settlements, primarily in and around Malacca, gradually adopted elements of Malaysian culture and intermarried with the Malaysian community and with this, a new ethnic group called emerged, the Peranakan ("Straits Chinese"). These Chinese have adopted Malay traditions while maintaining elements of Chinese culture such as their largely Buddhist and Taoist religion. The more common Chinese varieties spoken in Peninsular Malaysia are Cantonese, Mandarin, Hokkien, Hakka, Hainanese, and Fuzhou.|$|E
25|$|Numerous Chinese {{have worked}} {{and lived in}} Papua New Guinea, {{establishing}} Chinese-majority communities. Chinese merchants became established in the islands before European exploration. Anti-Chinese rioting involving {{tens of thousands of}} people broke out in May 2009. The initial spark was a fight between ethnic Chinese and Papua New Guinean workers at a nickel factory under construction by a Chinese company. Native resentment against Chinese ownership of numerous small businesses and their commercial monopoly in the islands led to the rioting. <b>The</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>have</b> long been merchants in Papua New Guinea.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>had</b> also rebelled {{several times}} against Spanish {{rule in the}} Philippines during this period, and the Spanish and Christian Filipinos engaged in massacres against <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> out of hatred of <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> {{economic}} dominance and their numbers.|$|R

50|$|D'Estaing reached Keelung on the {{afternoon}} of 3 October. By then the French had already secured the hills {{to the west of the}} town and <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>had</b> retreated, but Courbet was reluctant to release one of his three battalions of marine infantry. It was probably the correct decision, though it would later be criticised. Although <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>had</b> momentarily fallen back, they might launch a counterattack at any moment and, if they did, the French would need every man to hold the extensive defence perimeter they had just established at Keelung.|$|R
25|$|Only 50% of {{the roads}} in Anosy were {{passable}} in 2009, with the rest either closed {{during the rainy season}} or no longer passable at all. 4WD is recommended. While the road was paved from Tolagnaro west through Amboasary to Ambovombe, most of this pavement is wrecked. While the World Bank helped pave the roads in Tolagnaro and QMM has built a highway to export its ilmenite to the harbor and <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>have</b> repaired the road from Tolagnaro to Ranomafana, that is the limit of recent road repairs.|$|E
25|$|Each {{ethnic group}} {{has its own}} {{underlying}} culture that separates it from the others, and they have achieved different levels of integration. <b>The</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>have</b> integrated with Malay culture {{in a number of}} areas, including parts of Terengganu, and they form Malayanised groups such as the Baba Chinese in Malacca and the Sino-Kadazan of Sabah. Their years under combined British rule brought some joint sense of identity to all the ethnic groups, with English ideas and ideals providing some unifying features. A joint Malaysian culture {{can be seen in the}} symbiosis of the cultures of the people within it.|$|E
25|$|Throughout centuries, non-Visayan groups, {{most notably}} foreigners such as <b>the</b> <b>Chinese,</b> <b>have</b> settled in predominantly-Visayan cities in Visayas like Iloilo, Bacolod, Dumaguete and Cebu and Mindanao such as Cagayan de Oro, Iligan, Davao and General Santos. These Filipino-Chinese have been assimilated to {{mainstream}} society. One factor {{would be the}} limited number of Chinese schools in the Visayas which help maintain the Chinese identity and a stronger sense of a distinct community. Many of them, particularly the younger generation, have been de-cultured from Chinese traditions, share values about family and friends with other Filipinos, and do not write or speak Chinese well.|$|E

25|$|China's {{receptive}} {{and friendly}} {{embrace of the}} Jewish people on its soil {{has been one of}} affectionate sympathy as <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>have</b> developed a favorable view of Jews, admiring them for their contributions to humanity, their ability to survive, the sharing of Chinese values such as family, frugality, hard work and education, and being products of ancient civilizations have been an impetus towards the long and enduring friendship between the Chinese and Jewish peoples. Shared affinities and similar cultural commonalities has not only been an impetus for the close bonds between China and Israel but has also created a symbol of brotherhood between the two communities.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the period}} after 1850, <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>have</b> come to {{dominate}} small business in the major cities of the Nanyang. They tended not only to own the shops, but hire mostly Chinese workers, increasing the scope {{and power of the}} Chinese influence. These business are distinguished by high level of centralization, most of the decision-making relies on the owner-manager; absence of bureaucratic regulation, yielding a fluid organizational structure; an autocratic and paternalistic leadership style; existence of preferential treatment combined with extensive family ties of obligation of duty; and finally, a customized network of external links. These features set them apart from other businesses in the Nanyang and allowed them to thrive due to the entrepreneurial talent they demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>have</b> {{celebrated the}} harvest during the autumn full moon since the Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BCE). Morris Berkowitz, {{who studied the}} Hakka people during the 1960s, theorizes that the harvest celebration {{originally}} began with worshiping Mountain Gods after the harvest was completed. For the Baiyue peoples, the harvest time commemorated the dragon who brought rain for the crops. The celebration as a festival only started to gain popularity during the early Tang dynasty (618–907 CE). One legend explains that Emperor Xuanzong of Tang started to hold formal celebrations in his palace after having explored the Moon-Palace. The term mid-autumn (中秋) first appeared in Rites of Zhou, a written collection of rituals of the Western Zhou dynasty (1046–771 BCE).|$|E
50|$|Chinese {{who lived}} in Sulu ran guns across a Spanish {{blockade}} to supply the Moro Datus and Sultanates with weapons to fight the Spanish, who were engaging in a campaign to subjugate the Moro sultantes on Mindanao. A trade involving the Moros selling slaves and other goods in exchange for guns developed. <b>The</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>had</b> infiltrated <b>the</b> economy of the sultante, {{taking control of the}} Sultanate's economies in Mindanao and dominating the markets. Though the Sultans did not like the fact that <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>had</b> a monopoly over the economy, they did business with them. <b>The</b> <b>Chinese</b> set up a trading network between Singapore, Zamboanga, Jolo and Sulu.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>had</b> sent {{a message}} to the deposed Sultan (King) of Malacca {{concerning}} the fate of the Portuguese embassy, which <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> held prisoner.

5000|$|After Chinese forces entered Korea in November 1950, the UN Forces, {{uncertain}} about the intentions and warfighting capabilities of <b>the</b> <b>Chinese,</b> drew {{back behind the}} 38th parallel and waited to see what <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> would do. Plans were even made for complete withdrawal from the peninsula. [...] In this climate of general uncertainty, Lt. General Matthew B. Ridgway {{decided to make a}} stand at Chipyong-ni and also at Wonju. [...] He recognized that <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>had</b> overstretched their supply lines, and {{would not be able to}} keep up their advance much longer. He intended to use the 23rd RCT to blunt <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> attack so that the Eighth Army could carry out a counterattack before <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>had</b> a chance to consolidate their forces.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>have</b> {{claimed that}} most of the {{population}} of Tibet at that time were serfs, bound to land owned by lamas. This claim has been challenged by other researchers (see serfdom in Tibet controversy). Any attempt at land reform or the redistribution of wealth would have proved unpopular with the established landowners. The Seventeen Point Agreement was put into effect only in Tibet proper; ergo, eastern Kham and Amdo, being outside the administration of the government of Tibet, were treated like territory belonging to any other Chinese province, with land reform implemented in full. As a result, a rebellion broke out in these regions in June 1956. The rebellion eventually spread to Lhasa, but was crushed by 1959. The 14th Dalai Lama and other government principals fled to exile in India.|$|E
25|$|The {{second largest}} ethnic group at 6.66 million are the Chinese {{who make up}} 23.2% of the {{population}} excluding non-citizens as of 2017. They have been dominant in trade and business since the early 20th century. Malaysian Chinese businesses developed {{as part of the}} larger bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties. George Town and Ipoh are Chinese-majority cities, while Penang is the only state in Malaysia with a non-Bumiputera majority population. <b>The</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>have</b> been settling in Malaysia for many centuries, as seen in the emergence of the Peranakan culture, but the exodus peaked during the nineteenth century through trading and tin-mining. When they first arrived, the Chinese often worked the most grueling jobs like tin mining and railway construction. Later on, some of them owned businesses that became large conglomerates in today's Malaysia. Most Chinese are Tao Buddhist and retain strong cultural ties to their ancestral homeland.|$|E
25|$|Because the Chinese rarely {{executed}} prisoners, the Chinese {{consider themselves}} to be more lenient and humane than the North Koreans. However, the Chinese were unprepared for the large influx of POWs after their entry into the war, {{and a large number}} of prisoners were crowded into temporary camps for processing. Mass starvation and diseases soon swept through those camps during the winter of 1950–51, while numerous death marches were conducted by the Chinese to move the prisoners into permanent locations. Although the situation started to improve after permanent camps were established by January 1951, death by starvation still continued until April 1951. About 43 percent of all US POWs died from November 1950 to April 1951. In comparison, only 34 percent of all US prisoners died under Japanese captivity during World War II. <b>The</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>have</b> defended their actions by stating that all Chinese soldiers during this period were also suffering mass starvation and diseases {{due to the lack of}} a competent logistics system. The UN POWs, however, pointed out that a lot of the Chinese camps were located near the Sino-Korean border, and claimed that the starvation was used to force the prisoners to accept the communism indoctrinations programs. The starvation and the POW deaths finally stopped by the summer of 1951 after the armistice talk started.|$|E
50|$|On June 20, <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> forces {{launched}} {{another attack}} towards Hill Eerie {{and the rest}} of the T-Bone ridge area.
