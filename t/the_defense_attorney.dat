5|$|The {{violence}} turned {{public opinion}} against Dow, {{and he was}} denounced in newspapers across the nation. He was tried for violation of the prohibition law; the prosecutor was former U.S. Attorney General Nathan Clifford, a longtime Dow opponent, and <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> was a fellow founder of the Maine Temperance Society, future senator William P. Fessenden. Dow was acquitted, but his opponents convinced the coroner to impanel a jury that pronounced the protester's death a homicide. He was ultimately acquitted of that charge, but his popularity had suffered and he declined to run for re-election as mayor.|$|E

5|$|On August 6, 1981, Ray Taylor {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} Jack Bridges in a fight in Chicago. In advance of the trial, the {{prosecutor}} submitted a request for all the defense witnesses in the case. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> for Taylor provided a list of four individuals, which did not include witnesses Alfred Wormley and Pam Berkhalter. When the defendant tried to introduce these witnesses {{on the second day of}} the trial, the trial judge sanctioned the defense for failing to put the witness names on the original list provided to the prosecution. Therefore, it ruled the two unlisted witnesses would not be allowed to testify. The trial judge was specifically frustrated that the witness, Wormley, was known to the defense prior to trial, but was hidden away from the prosecution.|$|E

The psychiatrist was the first witness who was asked additional questions by Dahlgren; Dahlgren claimed he had been hearing voices in his head for two years every ten or fifteen seconds. Following this expert testimony, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> announced that the defense would order another expert witness testimony, while the judge adjourned the hearing until June 19.|$|E

25|$|Wolf {{took the}} idea to then-president of Universal Television Kerry McCluggage, who pointed out the {{similarity}} to a 1963 series titled Arrest and Trial, which lasted one season. The two watched the pilot of that series, in which a police officer (Ben Gazzara) arrested a man for armed robbery in the first half, and <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorney,</b> played by Chuck Connors gets the perpetrator off as the wrong guy in the second half; this was the formula of the show every week. Wolf decided that, while his detectives would occasionally also be fallible, he wanted a fresh approach to the genre, to go from police procedural to prosecution with {{a greater degree of}} realism. In addition, the prosecution would be the hero, a reversal of the usual formula in lawyer dramas.|$|E
25|$|Richard Ceballos {{had been}} {{employed}} since 1989 as a {{deputy district attorney}} for the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office, {{which at the time}} was headed by Gil Garcetti. After <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> in a pending criminal case contacted Ceballos about his motion to challenge a critical search warrant based on inaccuracies in the supporting affidavit, Ceballos conducted his own investigation and determined that the affidavit contained serious misrepresentations. Ceballos contacted the deputy sheriff who had sworn out the affidavit but was not satisfied by his explanations. Ceballos then communicated his findings to his supervisors and submitted a memorandum in which he recommended dismissal of the case. A meeting was subsequently held to discuss the affidavit with his superiors and officials from the sheriff's department, which Ceballos claimed became heated and accusatory of his role in handling the case. Despite Ceballos’ concerns, his supervisor decided to proceed with the prosecution. The criminal trial court held a hearing on the motion, during which Ceballos was called by the defense to recount his observations about the affidavit. The trial court nevertheless denied the motion and upheld the warrant.|$|E
500|$|He {{was finally}} tried in 1951 {{represented}} by {{civil rights attorney}} Vito Marcantonio. The case was dismissed before the jury rendered a verdict as soon as <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> told the judge that [...] "Dr. Albert Einstein has offered to appear as character witness for Dr. Du Bois". Du Bois's memoir of the trial is In Battle for Peace. Even though Du Bois was not convicted, the government confiscated Du Bois's passport and withheld it for eight years.|$|E

500|$|The {{impact of}} Washington was narrowed by a later case, Taylor v. Illinois (1988), {{in which the}} Court said that [...] "countervailing public interests", like the need to move through cases quickly, could be {{balanced}} against a defendant's right to present witnesses. In Taylor, the Supreme Court upheld a judge's order blocking defense witnesses from testifying due to <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorney's</b> deliberate failure to disclose evidence to prosecutors earlier in <b>the</b> trial. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorney's</b> actions resulted in a lengthy delay in the proceedings which the trial judge felt was unjustified. Legal scholars have seen this new grant of discretion to trial judges as a change to relying on [...] "efficient justice", a more limited vision of trial rights than the [...] "right to present a defense" [...] created in Washington.|$|R
25|$|On January 1, 1864, {{the trial}} {{continued}} with Dodd represented by attorneys T.D.W.

Court was adjourned until the next day.|$|R
500|$|Phoenix's {{childhood}} friend Miles Edgeworth, {{who is the}} protagonist of the Ace Attorney Investigations games, is a recurring rival prosecutor character; in addition to him, each new game in the series introduces a new rival: Franziska von Karma is introduced in the second game, Godot in the third, Klavier Gavin in the fourth, Simon Blackquill in the fifth, and Nahyuta Sahdmadhi in the sixth. The prosecutor characters are portrayed as powerful and arrogant characters of high social status, who favor convictions over finding the truth, and who care about keeping perfect-win records in court. Similarly to real Japanese prosecutors, the prosecutors in the series often directly oversee investigations, issuing orders to the police. Japanese attitudes towards the police force {{are reflected in the}} series, with the police being represented by incompetent characters such as Dick Gumshoe, Maggey Byrde and Mike Meekins. In the world of Ace Attorney, trials only last three days, and usually end with a [...] "guilty" [...] verdict. The outcomes of cases are decided by a judge, based on evidence provided by <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> and the prosecutor.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Pony" [...] Johnson {{murder trial}} {{is based on}} a real-life trial {{featured}} in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book about a Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series. In that real-life trial, a Baltimore detective misspeaks during his testimony and nearly jeopardizes the outcome of the case. This is mirrored by the actions of Kay Howard, who accidentally says the victim was dead at least 24 hours when she meant to say 12 hours, leaving an opening for defense attorney Darin Russom to question her recollection and expertise. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> in the real-life trial lost the case for himself with a procedural misstep similar to the one portrayed in [...] "And the Rockets Dead Glare". In the episode, Russom asks Howard whether she had ever seen a murder victim killed by both a knife and a gun. This allows Howard to mention a second victim police suspect [...] "Pony" [...] Johnson murdered, which she would not have been allowed to mention had Russom not asked her. Homicide filmmakers sought to portray the trial scenes in a far more realistic light than most police drama shows, particularly with the inclusion of less dramatic courtroom elements such as Howard's waiting anxiously to testify and the awkward pauses during her testimony.|$|E
2500|$|The defense did {{not perform}} better. When <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> began to shout racial epithets at Woodard, Waring stopped him immediately. During the trial, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> stated to the all-white jury that [...] "if you rule against Shull, then let this South Carolina secede again." [...] (Due to disfranchisement {{of blacks in the}} South, they were also {{excluded}} from juries.) After Woodard gave his account of the events, Shull firmly denied it. He claimed that Woodard had threatened him with a gun, and that Shull had used his nightclub to defend himself. During this testimony, Shull admitted that he repeatedly struck Woodard in the eyes.|$|E
