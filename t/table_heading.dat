25|$|In the 2010–11 season, Cabaye {{remained}} {{a fixture in}} the starting eleven under Garcia, however, unlike last season, the midfielder did not play as the primary play-maker as these duties were relinquished to wing forwards Hazard and Gervinho. On 24 October 2010, Cabaye scored his first goal of the campaign in a 3–1 defeat to Marseille. Three days later, he scored two goals, one from open play and another from the penalty spot, in a 4–1 win over Caen in the Coupe de la Ligue. After failing to score or assist on a goal in nearly two months, Cabaye provided assists for two Moussa Sow goals in a 6–3 hammering of Lorient in December 2010. In April 2011, Cabaye provided three assists in three league matches against Caen, Bordeaux, and Arles-Avignon. Cabaye also scored a goal in the match against the latter club. Lille went unbeaten in the three matches, which gave the club a four-point lead in the <b>table</b> <b>heading</b> into the final month of the season.|$|E

40|$|On the Great Northern Peninsula, western Newfoundland, the transqressive <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> Formation (Middle Ordovician) overlies the Lower Ordovician St. George Group. The <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> strata are overlain by {{carbonate}} breccias and easterly derived flysch deposits. The <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> sediments include limestones, mainly rubbly, with dolostones at {{the base}} (lower <b>Table</b> <b>Head),</b> overlain by limestones interbedded with shales (middle <b>Table</b> <b>Head)</b> and black graptolitiferous shales at the top (upper <b>Table</b> <b>Head).</b> The lower <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> limestones represent the last platform carbonate deposit before the bank foundered {{probably due to the}} emplacement of Lower Ordovician allochthons in western Newfoundland. [...] The formation has been studied in detail from eight localities in the area from Bellburns community in the south to St. John Island in the north. Additional information from localities on Port au Port Peninsula and Hare Bay is included. The <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> sediments all along on the west coast of Newfoundland compare with those in the study area. The thickness of the different units varies considerably and reaches its maximum at Table Point. The detailed investigation of the rocks revealed that carbonate accumulation was interrupted by "catastrophic" downwarps of the shelf. These {{may be related to the}} emplacement of the allochthons. [...] A total of approximately 17, 000 conodonts was recorded within the study area. An additional 3, 000 were recorded from elsewhere in western Newfoundland. The conodont fauna is described in multi-element taxonomy, and a supragenetic classification is applied. 35 genera and Panderodontidae, and the new recognized family Cornuodontidae n. fam [...] [...] Two phylo-zones and four biointerval-zones are defined. The phylo-zones are based on phylogenetically related and facies independent species of Histiodella. The species from the basal lower <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> on Newfoundland belong to Midcontinent Fauna 4, and are correlative with strata from North America. The conodonts reinforce trilobite and cephalopod data that indicate a late Whiterockian (early Llanvirnian age for these strata. The North Atlantic Province conodonts from the middle <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> have a number of species in common with the Eoplacognathus suecicus Zone of Scandinavia. The top of the middle <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> at <b>Table</b> Point may be as young as the E. suecicus-P. sulcatus Subzone. [...] The <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> strata accumulated in lagoonal, shelf (inner-outer) and slope environments. The lateral distribution of conodonts can be directly related to these depositional environments, and a sequence of three biofacies and sub-biofacies is introduced. The lagoonal (Midcontinent Province) and slope (North Atlantic Province) biofacies are distinct, whereas the shelf biofacies is less distinct. The occurrence of occasional invaders from the open oceanic biofacies can be related to the oscillating transgression...|$|R

50|$|The {{joy of the}} 1996-97 was {{immediately}} followed by the most painful season in Jawiya's history in 1997-98. Jawiya reached the 1998 Iraq FA Cup final and were winning 1-0 against Al-Zawraa heading into injury-time. The referee added six minutes of injury-time to the game, and Al-Zawraa broke Jawiya's hearts by scoring an equalising goal in the 97th minute of the game. There were no goals in extra-time and thus the game went to penalties where Al-Zawraa prevailed by a score of 4-3. Jawiya {{had the chance to}} bounce back from that heartbreaking disappointment less than a week later, as they sat on top of the league <b>table</b> <b>heading</b> into the final round of matches. To secure their second league title in a row, all Jawiya had to do was beat Al-Zawraa in their final game. If they drew against Al-Zawraa, they had to hope that Al-Shorta drew or lost in their game against mid-table side Al-Sulaikh that was being played at the same time. A loss for Jawiya would make it impossible to be champions. Jawiya took the lead in the game through Razzaq Farhan, but Adnan Mohammed scored an equalising goal in the second half for Al-Zawraa and the game ended 1-1. This meant that Jawiya had to hope that Al-Shorta did not beat Al-Sulaikh, which was unlikely.|$|E
