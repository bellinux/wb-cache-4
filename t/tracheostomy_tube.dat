5|$|The first {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} tracheal intubation and subsequent artificial respiration of animals were from Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) of Brussels. In his landmark book published in 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, he described an experiment in which he passed a reed into the trachea of a dying animal whose thorax had been opened and maintained ventilation by blowing into the reed intermittently. Antonio Musa Brassavola (1490–1554) of Ferrara successfully treated a patient suffering from peritonsillar abscess by tracheotomy. Brassavola published his account in 1546; this operation {{has been identified as}} the first recorded successful tracheotomy, despite the many previous references to this operation. Towards the end of the 16th century, Hieronymus Fabricius (1533–1619) described a useful technique for tracheotomy in his writings, although he had never actually performed the operation himself. Fabricius was the first to introduce the idea of a <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tube.</b> In 1620 the French surgeon Nicholas Habicot (1550–1624) published a report of four successful tracheotomies. In 1714, anatomist Georg Detharding (1671–1747) of the University of Rostock performed a tracheotomy on a drowning victim.|$|E
5|$|Tracheotomy {{consists}} {{of making an}} incision {{on the front of}} the neck and opening a direct airway through an incision in the trachea. The resulting opening can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tube</b> to be inserted; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use of his nose or mouth. The opening may be made by a scalpel or a needle (referred to as surgical and percutaneous techniques respectively) and both techniques are widely used in current practice. In order to limit the risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves (the nerves that control the voicebox), the tracheotomy is performed as high in the trachea as possible. If only one of these nerves is damaged, the patient's voice may be impaired (dysphonia); if both of the nerves are damaged, the patient will be unable to speak (aphonia). In the acute setting, indications for tracheotomy are similar to those for cricothyrotomy. In the chronic setting, indications for tracheotomy include the need for long-term mechanical ventilation and removal of tracheal secretions (e.g., comatose patients, or extensive surgery involving the head and neck).|$|E
25|$|Positive-pressure {{ventilators}} work {{by increasing}} the patient's airway pressure through an endotracheal or <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tube.</b> The positive pressure allows air to flow into the airway until the ventilator breath is terminated. Then, the airway pressure drops to zero, and the elastic recoil of the chest wall and lungs push the tidal volume — the breath-out through passive exhalation.|$|E

40|$|Background: Manufacturers’ {{recommendations}} on cleaning of <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> focus on general warning information and non-specific manual cleaning procedures. The {{aim of this}} experimental study was to evaluate different reprocessing methods and to determine the mechanical integrity and functionality of <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> following reprocessing. Methods: Sixteen cuffed or un-cuffed <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> obtained from hospital in-patients were reprocessed {{using one of the}} following reprocessing methods: a) manual brushing and rinsing with tap water, b) manual brushing followed by disinfection with a glutaraldehyde solution, c) manual brushing followed machine-based cleaning in a dishwasher, and d) manual brushing followed by ultrasound cleaning in a commercially available ultrasound device. Microbial burden of the tubes before and after reprocessing was assessed by measurement of microbial colony-forming units per mL (CFU/mL) of rinsing fluid. After cleaning, <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> were investigated for loss of functionality. Findings: Manual brushing and rinsing with tap water reduced microbial colonization in average by 102 CFU/mL, but with poor reproducibility and reliability. Complete microbial reduction was achieved only with additional chemical or machine-based thermal disinfection. Ultrasound sonification yielded no further microbial reduction after manual brushing. Conclusion: Manual brushing alone will not result in complete eradication of microorganism colonising cuffed or un-cuffed <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tubes.</b> However, manual cleaning followed by chemical or thermal disinfection may be regarded as safe and reproducible reprocessing method. If a machine-based reprocessing method is used for cuffed tubes, the cuffs’ ventilation hose must be secured in a safe position prior to thermal disinfection...|$|R
25|$|The {{design of}} the modern positive-pressure {{ventilators}} were based mainly on technical developments by the military during World War II to supply oxygen to fighter pilots in high altitude. Such ventilators replaced the iron lungs as safe endotracheal tubes with high-volume/low-pressure cuffs were developed. The popularity of positive-pressure ventilators rose during the polio epidemic in the 1950s in Scandinavia and the United States and {{was the beginning of}} modern ventilation therapy. Positive pressure through manual supply of 50% oxygen through a <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tube</b> led to a reduced mortality rate among patients with polio and respiratory paralysis. However, because of the sheer amount of man-power required for such manual intervention, mechanical positive-pressure ventilators became increasingly popular.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 16th century, anatomist and surgeon Hieronymus Fabricius (1533–1619) {{described}} a useful technique for tracheotomy in his writings, although he had never actually performed the operation himself. He advised using a vertical incision and was the first to introduce the idea of a <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tube.</b> This was a straight, short cannula that incorporated wings to prevent the tube from advancing too far into the trachea. He recommended the operation {{only as a last resort}} in cases of airway obstruction by foreign bodies or secretions. Fabricius' description of the tracheotomy procedure is similar to that used today. Julius Casserius (1561–1616) succeeded Fabricius as professor of anatomy at the University of Padua and published his own writings regarding technique and equipment for tracheotomy, recommending a curved silver tube with several holes in it. Marco Aurelio Severino (1580–1656), a skillful surgeon and anatomist, performed multiple successful tracheotomies during a diphtheria epidemic in Naples in 1610, using the vertical incision technique recommended by Fabricius. He also developed his own version of a trocar.|$|E
500|$|The easiest {{method to}} perform this {{technique}} is the needle cricothyrotomy (also {{referred to as a}} percutaneous dilational cricothyrotomy), in which a large-bore (12–14 gauge) intravenous catheter is used to puncture the cricothyroid membrane. Oxygen can then be administered through this catheter via jet insufflation. However, while needle cricothyrotomy may be life-saving in extreme circumstances, {{this technique is}} only intended to be a temporizing measure until a definitive airway can be established. While needle cricothyrotomy can provide adequate oxygenation, the small diameter of the cricothyrotomy catheter is insufficient for elimination of carbon dioxide (ventilation). After one hour of apneic oxygenation through a needle cricothyrotomy, one can expect a PaCO2 of greater than 250mm Hg and an arterial pH of less than 6.72, despite an oxygen saturation of 98% or greater. A more definitive airway can be established by performing a surgical cricothyrotomy, in which a [...] endotracheal tube or <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tube</b> can be inserted through a larger incision.|$|E
25|$|Tracheostomy — When {{patients}} require {{mechanical ventilation}} for several weeks, a tracheostomy {{may provide the}} most suitable access to the trachea. A tracheostomy is a surgically created passage into the trachea. <b>Tracheostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> are well-tolerated and often do not necessitate any use of sedative drugs. <b>Tracheostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> may be inserted early during treatment in patients with pre-existing severe respiratory disease, or in any patient expected {{to be difficult to}} wean from mechanical ventilation, i.e., patients with little muscular reserve.|$|R

In addition, respiratory (bacterial and viral) filters (filter pads, Fisher and Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand) were used.|$|R
50|$|Several {{types of}} <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> are available, {{depending}} on {{the requirements of the}} patient, including Shiley, Bivona (a silicon tube with metal rings that are good for airways with damage to the tracheal rings or otherwise not straight), and fenestrated.|$|R
500|$|A {{tracheal}} tube is a catheter that is {{inserted into the}} trachea for {{the primary purpose of}} establishing and maintaining a patent (open and unobstructed) airway. Tracheal tubes are frequently used for airway management in the settings of general anesthesia, critical care, mechanical ventilation and emergency medicine. Many different types of {{tracheal tube}}s are available, suited for different specific applications. An endotracheal tube is a specific type of tracheal tube that is nearly always inserted through the mouth (orotracheal) or nose (nasotracheal). It is a breathing conduit designed to be placed into the airway of critically injured, ill or anesthetized patients in order to perform mechanical positive pressure ventilation of the lungs and to prevent the possibility of aspiration or airway obstruction. The endotracheal tube has a fitting designed to be connected to a source of pressurized gas such as oxygen. At the other end is an orifice through which such gases are directed into the lungs and may also include a balloon (referred to as a cuff). The tip of the endotracheal tube is positioned above the carina (before the trachea divides to each lung) and sealed within the trachea so that the lungs can be ventilated equally. A <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tube</b> is another type of tracheal tube; this [...] curved metal or plastic tube is inserted into a tracheostomy stoma or a cricothyrotomy incision.|$|E
2500|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} is {{the medical}} term for artificial ventilation where mechanical means {{is used to}} assist or replace spontaneous breathing. This may involve a machine called a ventilator or the breathing may be assisted by an Anesthesiologist, certified registered nurse anesthetist, physician, physician assistant, respiratory therapist, paramedic, EMT, or other suitable person compressing a bag or set of bellows. Mechanical ventilation is termed [...] "invasive" [...] if it involves any instrument penetrating through the mouth (such as an endotracheal tube) or the skin (such as a <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tube).</b> There are two main types: positive pressure ventilation, where air (or another gas mix) is pushed into the trachea, and negative pressure ventilation, where air is, in essence, sucked into the lungs. There are many modes of mechanical ventilation, and their nomenclature has been revised over the decades as the technology has continually developed.|$|E
50|$|TIF is a late {{complication}} of a tracheotomy and {{is associated with}} prolonged endotracheal intubation, {{as a result of}} cuff over inflation or a poorly positioned <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tube.</b> Over inflation of the cuff causes the <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tube</b> to erode into the posterior aspect of the innominate artery leading to the formation of a fistula. The pathogenesis of an TIF by the aforementioned method is pressure necrosis by <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tube</b> on the tracheal wall. An TIF can also occur due to innominate artery injury {{as a result of an}} bronchoscopy.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{management}} generally involves {{efforts to}} prevent pulmonary complications, since lung infections can be fatal in patients lacking the muscle strength necessary to clear secretions via coughing. Medical devices to assist with coughing help patients maintain clear airways, avoiding mucous plugs and avoiding the need for <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
30|$|Luminal {{stenosis}} of {{the upper}} trachea can occur in patients {{with a history of}} tracheal intubation. High pressure in the tube balloon for prolonged periods may produce necrosis of the tracheal mucosa, leading the development of scar fibrosis, which produces luminal stenosis [16]. The phenomenon may be seen with orotracheal and <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> and is {{the most common cause of}} acquired tracheal stenosis.|$|R

Sedation, maintenance fluids, and mechanical ventilation were applied similarly to all groups using standardized ICU protocols [21, 26].|$|R
50|$|A <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tube</b> {{consists}} of an outer cannula or main shaft, an inner cannula, and an obturator. The obturator is used when inserting the <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tube</b> to guide {{the placement of the}} outer cannula and is removed once the outer cannula is in place. The outer cannula remains in place but, because of the buildup of secretions, there is an inner cannula that may be removed for cleaning or replaced.

40|$|Background: Patients with <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> {{are at risk}} of {{aspiration}} and swallowing problems (dysphagia) {{and because}} of their medical acuity, complications in this patient population can be severe. It is well recognised that swallow screening in stroke significantly reduces potential complications by allowing early identification and appropriate management of patients at risk (by health professionals), thereby reducing delays in commencing oral intake and preventing unnecessary, costly interventions by speech and language therapists (SLTs). However, there is no standardised swallow screen for the tracheostomised population and there is a paucity of literature regarding either current or best practice in this area. Aims: The aim of this study was therefore to investigate current United Kingdom (UK) practice for swallow (dysphagia) screening for adult patients with <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> and to explore and describe health professionals’ perceptions of their current practice/current systems used. Methods and Procedures: A mixed methods approach was adopted, comprising a semi-structured online questionnaire and recorded follow-up telephone interviews. Participants were SLTs, nurses and physiotherapists working with patients with tracheostomies. Responses were analysed to determine current practice with regard to swallow screening. Thematic analysis of interviews allowed further exploration and clarification of the questionnaire findings. Outcomes and Results: Two-hundred and twenty one questionnaires were completed.

The only inclusion criterion for aspiration of respiratory secretions with the “Cough Assist™” airway clearance device was therefore the need for secretion suctioning, regardless of severity or degree of respiratory or other organ dysfunctions.|$|R
40|$|Do {{people with}} {{long-term}} tracheostomy need hospital care? Which cleaning method is {{most appropriate for}} decontamination of inner cannulae? Are <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> changed for rational reasons? There is clearly a lack of evidence based {{research in this field}} and the clinical guidelines available are often based on local practice. A tracheostomy is a created opening in trachea to facilitate breathing. It is a direct entry to the deeper airways, e. g. for micro-organisms causing a potential risk for lung infections. Indications for long-term tracheostomy can be, e. g. upper airway obstruction, malformations, or chronic hypoventilation, when ventilation via nasal mask is not possible. The research of the present thesis was conducted at the National Respiratory Centre (NRC) at Danderyd Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. This unit opened in 1982, with the expressed goal of supporting outpatients with long-term tracheostomy. The overall aims of the thesis were to evaluate the outcome of patients with long-term tracheostomy and to conduct evidence based studies concerning their care. A comparison was made for the number of days in hospital care during the 2 -year periods before and after the tracheostomy was established. The life expectancy of the general population and the observed life span of a cohort of tracheostomized patients from the start of NRC in 1982 were also compared. Interestingly enough, the need for hospital care was unchanged despite of the tracheostomy. The patients observed life spans were remarkably high and for many patients not lower than the life expectancy of Swedish people in general. To find a practical and safe decontamination method for inner cannulae we compared two different cleaning methods; detergent followed by chlorhexidine-alcohol, or detergent alone. Samples for bacterial culture were taken before and after cleaning and the numbers of bacteria colonies were counted. The effectiveness of both cleaning methods was greater than expected and the results showed a nearly total elimination of organisms. Thus, the methods investigated were equivalent in achieving decontamination. The duration of use in our unit for polymeric <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tubes,</b> i. e. silicone (Si), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyurethane (PU) was determined and compared. We found, that Si tubes were used for longer periods (three months) than tubes made of PU or PVC (both two months). Whether or not surface changes could be observed on the <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> after 30 days, three and six months exposure in the trachea were investigated in collaboration with the Royal Institute of Technology and Sophiahemmet University College in Stockholm, Sweden. The analyzing methods were Scanning Electron Microscopy, Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, and Differential Scanning Calorimetry. All tubes, except one, showed changes in the surface after 30 days exposure. The surface changes had progressed significantly after three and six months' exposure, compared to the changes detected after 30 days. The SF- 36 questionnaire and a study specific questionnaire were used to describe the patients health-related quality of life and experiences of long-term tracheostomy. The results show that all patients were satisfied with their tracheostomy and demonstrated a numerically mean mental health status score above that of the general population. In summary, long-term tracheostomy does not increase the need for hospital care nor does it reduce a patient s life span. Cleaning the tracheostomy inner cannula with detergent and water is sufficient to achieve decontamination. Si <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> are used longer compared to those made of PVC or PU. The polymeric material investigated suffered evident surface changes after 30 days use. Clinical use of polymeric <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> beyond three months cannot be recommended, as we found extensive surface changes and degradation of the polymeric chains. All patients were, in general content, with their tracheostomy. The findings from the present thesis contribute to making the care of long-term tracheostomized patients evidence based...|$|R

Our study aimed to determine the distribution rate of DANIs and causative agents and patterns of antibiotic resistance in the trauma-surgical intensive care unit (ICU).  Methods: Our study was conducted at Abusalim Trauma Hospital in Tripoli, Libya. All devices associated with {{nosocomial infections}}, including central venous catheters (CVC), endotracheal tubes (ETT), Foley’s urinary catheters, chest tubes, nasogastric <b>tubes</b> (NGT), and <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tubes,</b> were removed aseptically and examined for Gram-negative bacteria (GNB).  Results: During a one-year study period, 363 patients were hospitalized; the overall mortality rate was 29 %. A total of 79 DANIs were identified, the most common site of infection was ETT (39. 2 %), followed by urinary catheters (19 %), NGTs (18 %), <b>tracheostomy</b> <b>tubes</b> (11 %), CVCs (10 %), and chest tubes (3 %). The most frequently isolated organisms were Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30 %, 20 %, and 14 %, respectively). Extremely high resistance rates were observed among GNB to ampicillin (99 %), cefuroxime (95 %), amoxicillin-clavulante (92 %), and nitrofurantoin (91 %). Lower levels of resistance were exhibited to amikacin (38 %), imipenem (38 %), and colistin (29 %). About 39 % of the isolates were defined as multi-drug resistant (MDR). Overall, extended spectrum β-lactmase producers were expressed in 39 % of isolates mainly among K. pneumonia (88 %). A. baumannii isolates exhibited extremely high levels of resistance to all antibiotics except colistin (100 % sensitive). In addition, 56. 3 % of A. baumannii isolates were found to be MDR. P. aeruginosa isolates showed 46 %– 55 % effectiveness to anti-pseudomonas antibiotics.  Conclusion: High rates of DANI’s and the emergence of MDR organisms poses a serious threat to patients.
