25|$|An {{advantage}} of index-based insurance {{is that it}} can potentially be delivered at lower cost. A significant barrier that hinders uptake of claim-based insurance is the high <b>transaction</b> <b>cost</b> for searching for prospective policyholders, negotiating and administering contracts, verifying losses and determining payouts. Index insurance eliminates the loss verification step, thereby mitigating a significant <b>transaction</b> <b>cost.</b> A second {{advantage of}} index-based insurance is that, because it pays an indemnity based on the reading of an index rather than individual losses, it eliminates much of the fraud, moral hazard and adverse selection, which are common in classical claim-based insurance. A further advantage of index insurance is that payments based on a standardized and indisputable index also allow for a fast indemnity payment. The indemnity payment could be automated, further reducing transaction costs.|$|E
25|$|As {{a medium}} of exchange, money {{facilitates}} trade. It {{is essentially a}} measure of value and more importantly, a store of value being a basis for credit creation. Its economic function can be contrasted with barter (non-monetary exchange). Given a diverse array of produced goods and specialized producers, barter may entail a hard-to-locate double coincidence of wants {{as to what is}} exchanged, say apples and a book. Money can reduce the <b>transaction</b> <b>cost</b> of exchange because of its ready acceptability. Then it is less costly for the seller to accept money in exchange, rather than what the buyer produces.|$|E

This paper examines {{the effects of}} a reduction in such consumer <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> caused by market-level technological advances. Using a model in which consumers are simultaneously heterogenous in their <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> and in their marginal valuation of product quality, we highlight two mechanisms that can cause such reductions in consumer <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> to lower consumer surplus and reduce consumer share of the total social surplus. We also show that when a seller can invest to reduce consumer <b>transaction</b> <b>costs,</b> consumers may be better off with higher <b>transaction</b> <b>costs.</b> Finally, the paper shows how such reductions in consumer <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> can either lower or raise consumer prices...|$|R

This includes websites that allow users to access information {{such as how to}} build a 3D printer, as well as social forums that discuss how to improve 3D print quality and discuss 3D printing news, as well as social media websites that are dedicated to share 3D models. RepRap is a wiki based website that was created to hold all information on 3d printing, and has developed into a community that aims to bring 3D printing to everyone. Furthermore, there are other sites such as Pinshape, Thingiverse and MyMiniFactory, which were created initially to allow users to post 3D files for anyone to print, allowing for decreased <b>transaction</b> <b>cost</b> of sharing 3D files.

40|$|In this paper, <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> in the EU {{emissions}} trading scheme (EU ETS) are examined empirically based on survey data from German companies. <b>Transaction</b> <b>costs</b> from measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of emissions, permit trading and general informational <b>costs</b> are considered. <b>Transaction</b> <b>costs</b> from MRV and permit trading are of non-linear form and dependent on annual emission and trading volumes based on OLS and nonparametric estimation. As {{a consequence of}} non-linear <b>transaction</b> <b>costs,</b> welfare losses occur compared to a first-best setup under zero <b>transaction</b> <b>costs.</b> In practice, smaller emitters will emit less (abate more) compared to larger emitters and vice versa due to economies of scale {{in the management of}} {{emissions trading}}. The results further imply that optimal firm size might be influenced by <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> in the EU ETS because of relatively high average <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> amongst smaller emitters. Overall annual <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> in the EU ETS in Germany are estimated to be EUR 8. 7 million. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Transaction</b> <b>costs</b> have {{negative}} effects oil emissions trading. Recent debates on the Kyoto Protocol {{have emphasized the}} potential threat of <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> {{to the implementation of}} emissions trading for the Protocol and consequently to the successful implementation of the Protocol. One way to suppress <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> is to use experience. In line with the EU Green Paper, we propose that an experimental early action before the Kyoto period could be helpful to reduce the <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> in emissions trading for the Kyoto compliance. However, because early action will incur additional costs, the final gain due to early action will be the cost-saving net of the costs of early action. This paper explores the relationship between the <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> in emissions trading and the early action effort to reduce <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> in the case of Kyoto Protocol. We find that in general early action can effectively offset <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> and thus are economically efficient. Only in the case of high <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> and constantly slow learning process, early action may become inefficient. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|International audienceTransaction cost {{has emerged}} as a core concept in the New Institutional Economics (NIE) and an {{important}} theoretical tool for researchers in this field. Measuring <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> and the quantitative analysis of the relationship between <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> and other economic indicators has become a central theme of analysis in the NIE. By measuring China's macroscopic <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> since 1978 and utilizing a dynamic econometric model, this chapter analyzes the relationship between macroscopic <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> and China's economic growth and trade structure changes. The findings suggest that in the mid- and long-term, growth in China's macroscopic <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> does stimulate exports while restraining domestic trade.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> on the post–earnings announcement drift (PEAD). Using standard market microstructure features we show that <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> constrain the informed trades {{that are necessary to}} incorporate earnings information into price. This implies weaker return responses {{at the time of the}} earnings announcement and higher subsequent returns drift for firms with higher <b>transaction</b> <b>costs.</b> Consistent with this prediction, we find that earnings response coefficients are lower for firms with higher <b>transaction</b> <b>costs.</b> Using portfolio analyses, we find that the profits of implementing the PEAD trading strategy are significantly reduced by <b>transaction</b> <b>costs.</b> In addition, we show, using a combination of portfolio and regression analyses, that firms with higher <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> are the ones that provide the higher abnormal returns for the PEAD strategy.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a two-stage oligopoly model with downstream retailers and {{two types of}} <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> (in contracting retailers and in direct retailing). Our analysis shows how <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> affect vertical integration in a strategic model of oligopoly, and it relates <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> to other characteristics of oligopolistic industries.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the impact of <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> on {{economic}} welfare and development, and the role of information technology (IT) in reducing <b>transaction</b> <b>costs.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The paper extends the static model of Romer, in which <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> reduce welfare by reducing the equilibrium number of intermediate goods, and estimate the welfare losses in the case of domestic <b>transaction</b> <b>costs.</b> The main analysis of the paper extends a dynamic model of Ciccone and Matsuyama to incorporate <b>transaction</b> <b>costs.</b> Also described are case studies of the use of IT in rural India. Findings – In the static model, it is shown that domestic <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> have a substantial welfare impact when the number of goods is endogenous. In the dynamic model, it is shown that high <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> reduce the long-run level of development, and may arrest development completely in the extreme case. Some preliminary, qualitative evidence from rural India is offered to illustrate how these reductions may occur through the use of IT. Originality/value – The treatment of <b>transaction</b> <b>costs</b> in a dynamic model is novel, and the use of such a model provides a new theoretical underpinning for understanding the potential impacts of IT on development.
