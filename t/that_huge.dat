It {{was in the}} 1960s that deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon became more widespread, chiefly from the removal of forest {{to make way for}} cattle ranching to raise national revenue during a period of high world beef prices, to eliminate hunger and to pay off international debt obligations.

25|$|The Holocaust {{also had}} {{a major impact on}} works of art created before the Holocaust.

Although the original owners were in turn brutally murdered during the Holocaust, many of their relatives survived, and naturally would like to retrieve their long-lost family heirlooms. A current owner cannot simply plead ignorance of an artwork's terrible history, since a thief can never convey good title. One who purchases stolen property from a thief must give the property back to its rightful owner and sue the thief (if he has not already vanished) for fraud to get one's money back.|$|E

Kennedy refused again and again, saying he could not oppose Lyndon Johnson, a sitting president. On November 30, Eugene McCarthy, a brilliant yet little-known senator, declared he would run against the war and challenge Johnson. Parrish was elected chair of his speaker's bureau and utilized STOP! to develop support for McCarthy. On March 12, 1968, McCarthy almost defeated Johnson in the New Hampshire primary winning 42% of the vote. On March 16 (four days later) Bobby Kennedy announced that he would run for president. Two weeks later, on March 31, Johnson declared that he would not run again for president. Parrish remained loyal to McCarthy and was elected a delegate to represent him in August at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.|$|E

The lyrics go on to reference two more men, who {{would seem to be}} Ben Affleck (“went nowhere but kept the ring”) and Lopez’s current husband, Marc Anthony (“he sang to me.”)" [...] Allison Stewart from The Washington Post said that [...] "One Love" [...] examines all of her high-profiled relationships, and commented that Lopez is not [...] "trying to gin up controversy with these red-meat tidbits about her personal life.

After ZIPRA commander Dumiso Dabengwa refused to give the disarming order at Entumbane, Nkomo oversaw a parade of the camp and gave the command to disarm himself, doing so [...] "for the sake of peace", in Kriger's words, despite his own opposition to the idea. Mugabe publicly announced his deal with North Korea in August 1981, and 106 North Korean instructors arrived the same month. Nkomo accused the Prime Minister of creating [...] "a special partisan army divorced from the national army" [...] for the [...] "possible imposition of a one-party state". In February 1982, Mugabe announced <b>that</b> <b>huge</b> arms caches had been discovered on ZAPU-owned properties and that this was evidence of a planned ZAPU coup.

500|$|Jackson {{was working}} as an {{entrepreneur}} in digital audio electronics in 1993 when Barbra Streisand's producer asked him to mix her first concert tour in decades. Jackson signed on partly because he was assured he could {{do anything to make}} her concert sound as good as possible. Jackson determined <b>that</b> <b>huge</b> concert venues such as Wembley Stadium and Madison Square Garden would be carpeted for Streisand, and that expensive heavy drapes would be hung at the walls to damp sound reflections. After discovering that Streisand did not like to listen to any stage monitors made after the 1960s, he designed a stage wedge which used soft dome drivers for midrange and for high frequencies rather than the more powerful compression drivers in common use after the 1970s. As well, the main sound system Jackson specified was a new design by Clair Brothers, a proprietary line array system called the I4. Streisand was not willing to wear in-ear monitors but the band was fitted with them, to reduce stage wash and make the band's instruments stand out better individually in the mix. The stage monitors, line array and extravagant acoustic treatments were a hit with Streisand, who said of Jackson that he was [...] "the best sound engineer in the world." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Time Will Crawl" [...] {{was written}} and {{recorded}} by Bowie in mid– to late–1986 at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland. He produced the recording alongside David Richards. Lyrically, the song addresses the pollution {{and destruction of}} the planet by industry. Bowie has cited hearing of the Chernobyl disaster in April 1986 as {{the genesis of the}} lyrics, and was in Switzerland {{at the time of the}} accident. He said, [...] "I was taking a break from recording [...] it was a beautiful day and we were outside on a small piece of lawn facing the Alps and the lake. Our engineer, who had been listening to the radio, shot out of the studio and shouted: 'There's a whole lot of shit going down in Russia.' The Swiss news had picked up a Norwegian radio station that was screaming – to anyone who would listen – <b>that</b> <b>huge</b> billowing clouds were moving over from the Motherland and they weren't rain clouds." [...] In another contemporary interview, Bowie said that the song [...] "deals with the idea that someone in one's own community could be the one responsible for blowing up the world."

500|$|Critic Allan Raible of ABC News {{compared}} the song to earlier Radiohead songs [...] "How to Disappear Completely" [...] and [...] "Pyramid Song" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} compositions Thom Yorke and company have ever released." [...] Richardson gave the song a score of seven out of ten in Pitchforks song review feature The Playlist, and wrote that while it could be criticized as [...] "a noble but failed experiment, overly maudlin and sentimental even if it is surface-level pretty", the song's [...] "simplicity and unsubtle affect, especially coming from this band, wind up being strengths." [...] In a later column, Richardson would further defend the song from charges of excessive sentimentality and attributes the song's emotional success to its severe subject, death: [...] "If these pieces were connected to thoughts of breaking up with a girlfriend or getting fired or lamenting cold weather or any of a million other of life's tragedies, they wouldn't work, {{at least not in the}} same way. They need <b>that</b> <b>huge</b> weight [...] on the other end to balance them out." [...] Kyle Anderson of MTV.com called the song a [...] "slow, florid affair" [...] and placed its [...] "typically dark" [...] lyrics in the context of Radiohead's previous political activism, such as their participation in the anti-human trafficking MTV EXIT campaign.|$|E
