5|$|Byron took Giraud {{to visit}} Charles Lewis Meryon, an English doctor who recounted the visit {{in his memoirs}} and noted Byron's vivid {{interest}} in the boy. Afterward, rumours were spread by Byron's servant that the consultation concerned an anal rupture. Meryon was a <b>travelling</b> <b>companion</b> with Michael Bruce and Lady Hester Stanhope, one of Byron's friends. Accounts from Bruce and Howe Browne, both witnesses to Byron's interactions with Giraud, provided confirmation of the relationship to Byron's early biographer Thomas Moore, although in disparaging terms. In mid-1810, Giraud acted as Byron's majordomo on their travels to the Peloponnese, {{and took care of}} Byron during his illness while at Patras, eventually becoming ill himself. After recovering, although still weak, the pair continued on their travels, arriving at Athens on 13October.

In a brief address to liturgists on the anniversary of Musicam Sacram, Francis mentions eight times the importance of the peoples’ active participation in song. In an address to charismatics he reemphasizes this: “You are able to shout out when your team scores a goal, and you cannot sing the Lord’s praises and leave behind your composure a little to sing”.

25|$|Hartnell's Doctor would {{initially}} {{be accompanied}} by his granddaughter Susan Foreman (played by Carole Ann Ford), originally to have been merely a <b>travelling</b> <b>companion,</b> but with a family tie added by Coburn, who was uncomfortable with the possible undertones the relationship could carry were they to be unrelated. They were joined in the first episode by two of Foreman's schoolteachers, Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell), from contemporary 20th century England. This remained the line-up of the series for the entire first season, but over time the regular line-up would change regularly as the Doctor's various companions left him to return home, having found new causes on worlds they had visited and elected to stay there, or even occasionally being killed off. However, he would always quickly find new travelling companions. Such characters were used by the production team to relate {{the point of view}} of the viewers at home, asking questions and furthering the stories by getting into trouble.|$|E
