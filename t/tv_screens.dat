5|$|Cathodoluminescence (CL) — light {{emission}} excited by electron beam — {{is a process}} commonly observed in <b>TV</b> <b>screens.</b> An electron beam can be finely focused and scanned across the studied material. This technique is widely used to study defects in semiconductors and nanostructures with nanometer-scale spatial resolution. It would be beneficial to apply this technique to carbon nanotubes. However, no reliable CL, i.e. sharp peaks assignable to certain (n,m) indices, has been detected from carbon nanotubes yet.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{idea was to}} film the opening sequence in 1.33:1 aspect ratio in order to simulate the <b>TV</b> <b>screens</b> that were {{available at the time}} of the assassination, then transition to 1.85:1 when Garrison began his investigation, and finally switch to 2.35:1 for scenes occurring in 1968 and later. However, because of time constraints and logistics, Richardson was forced to abandon this approach.|$|E
50|$|Photographs of a <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> {{taken with}} a digital camera often exhibit moiré patterns. Since both the <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> and the digital camera use a {{scanning}} technique to produce or to capture pictures with horizontal scan lines, the conflicting sets of lines cause the moiré patterns. To avoid the effect, the digital camera can be aimed at an angle of 30 degrees to the <b>TV</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|R
30|$|This article {{proposes a}} {{real-time}} test and verification system for full-reference automatic image quality {{assessment and verification}} of digital TV sets. Digital camera is used for acquisition of the <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> content {{in order to ensure}} quality assessment of the content as perceived by the user. Test has been executed in three steps: image acquisition by camera, <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> content extraction and full-reference image quality assessment. The <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> content is extracted from the captured image in two steps: detection of the <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> edge and transformation of the <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> content to dimensions of the reference image. Three image comparison methods are incorporated to perform full-reference image quality assessment. Reference image for quality assessment is obtained either by grabbing the image from TV set or by capturing the <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> content on the golden sample. Digital camera was later replaced with DSP-based camera for image acquisition and algorithm execution which brought significant performance improvements. The comparison methods were tested under constant and variable illumination conditions. The proposed system is used to automate the verification step on the final production line of digital TV sets. The time required for verification step decreased by a factor of 5 when using the proposed system on the final production line instead of a manual one.|$|R
30|$|As mentioned, <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> edge {{does not}} {{represent}} any regular geometric shape. When its vertices are connected with straight lines, they form a general quadrilateral. The first step is transforming the rectangle into a quadrilateral formed by connecting the vertices of the detected <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> edge.|$|R
5|$|Greater Manchester Police {{operate a}} Video Intelligence Unit, whose plainclothes {{officers}} confront and video certain freed prisoners {{as they leave}} prison after serving their sentences. They also record footage of people involved in anti-social behaviour on the streets. The aim is to give other police officers up to date information on the appearance {{of people who have}} broken the law. Video footage thus collected is constantly replayed on <b>TV</b> <b>screens</b> in rooms where officers complete their paperwork. Footage that they have recorded has also been uploaded onto YouTube in an attempt to catch people they believe have reoffended.|$|E
5|$|The Cowshed houses away fans at Prenton Park, {{and has a}} {{capacity}} of 2,500. It has a slanted seating arrangement, caused by the main road running behind it. It historically housed the more vocal home fans, but was switched to away supporters around {{the start of the}} 21st century. Since the change, a bar and <b>TV</b> <b>screens</b> {{have been added to the}} stand. The name is derived from its appearance before the redevelopment in 1995. With a 3 peak roof of corrugated iron, walls of wooden plank and a cinder bank floor it visually resembled an agricultural building.|$|E
5|$|The {{photostability}} of pigments can {{be enhanced}} {{by the addition of}} cerium. It provides pigments with light fastness and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight. Television glass plates are subject to electron bombardment, which tends to darken them by creation of F-center color centers. This effect is suppressed by addition of cerium oxide. Cerium is also an essential component of phosphors used in <b>TV</b> <b>screens</b> and fluorescent lamps. Cerium sulfide forms a red pigment that stays stable up to 350°C. The pigment is a nontoxic alternative to cadmium sulfide pigments.|$|E

5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi. It opens with Hamasaki watching her previous music videos on several television screens. Sitting in a small room, she exits it and finds {{a large amount of}} fans and paparazzi bombarding her; scenes interspersed through the main plot feature her looking towards a mirror. Following the first chorus, Hamasaki is shown riding through Tokyo city, including her appearance at a recording studio singing the song, and on top of a skyscraper at night. The frames subsequently re-appear throughout the visual, with it ending with a blurry shot of Hamasaki looking away from the mirror, and the <b>TV</b> <b>screens</b> from the first shot displaying the logo of Avex Trax. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016). It was additionally used as the theme for Japanese television show Semi Double (1999).|$|E

30|$|The {{captured}} and the reference images {{are used as}} inputs to the detection and comparison algorithm, presented in the following sections. The main challenge in algorithm design {{was to make a}} robust method of detecting the borders of <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> and transform the <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> content from the captured image to the dimensions of the reference image. The two images need to have the same dimensions for comparison. Transformation is the crucial part before the comparison can be performed because the <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> content does not appear as a rectangle in the captured image. Instead, it appears as a slightly curved quadrilateral due to the curvature of the camera lenses and relative orientation of the camera and the <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> plane. The transformation problem is addressed and transformation equations are derived in algorithm section. The output of the algorithm is the similarity measure of the two contents. That output is used in making the decision about the matching of the two contents, as discussed later.|$|R

25|$|The {{final plan}} of the stadium and its {{facilities}} was settled in December 2006 and included several improvements compared to the early plans presented in 2005. The total budget of 240 million SEK that {{was said to have}} been very tight had been increased to 270 million SEK, which amongst several additions allowed for the construction of closed corners. The original plans aimed for a capacity of 17,800 divided on 14,000 seatsof which 2,400 seats can be transformed to terraces if neededand a terrace capacity of 3,800. The stadium was also planned to feature two large <b>TV</b> <b>screens</b> and 2,500m² of commercial space and a 900m² lounge with 18 private boxes.|$|E
25|$|The idea {{to bring}} Ugly Betty to American <b>TV</b> <b>screens</b> began in 2001 when NBC was {{planning}} to adapt Betty as a half-hour comedy, which would be produced by Sony Pictures Television but it never made past the planning stages (It took three writers {{to come up with}} a concept based around the character) until ABC and Hayek's company came on board in 2004 and retooled it as an hour-long comedy-drama. Two years later, on May 16, 2006, ABC announced that Ugly Betty would be part of the 2006–2007 North American season lineup as a weekly hour-long series; the initial order was for 13 episodes.|$|E
30|$|This article proposes an {{approach}} for an automated verification of digital television sets based on <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> content acquisition by camera and {{comparison of the}} captured content with {{the content of the}} reference image. Recent automatic systems for functional verification of digital TV sets use the grabber to capture the content of the TV memory and compare it to the reference content [8]. This approach does not provide verification of the <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> content seen from user side, only verification of the <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> content represented in the memory. While grabbing the TV memory content is easier, we propose the usage of camera to acquire the <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> content in order to ensure quality testing of the content as seen by the user. The camera usage allows detection of problems arising in the circuits between the TV memory and the screen, i.e., when the image on the screen does not correspond to the image in the TV memory and when the TV functional operation fails. The system is based on the algorithm which extracts the content of the <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> from the captured image and compares it with the reference images [9, 10]. The system is used as part of the Black Box Testing (BBT) system [1, 8].|$|R

In {{the last years of}} his career, Howerd developed a following with student audiences and performed a one-man show at universities and in small theatrical venues. He was also a regular and popular guest on the late night BBC Radio 1 programme Into the Night, hosted by Nicky Campbell.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, karaoke was {{gradually}} popularized {{in the late}} 1980s. A number of Filipino migrants brought with them their own 'minus-one' music from cassette music tapes and video tapes purchased mainly in the Philippines. A number of Philippine-imported karaoke units with two cassette drives were used in private households. Video TV tapes, mainly consisted of popular and contemporary songs rendered by Filipino artists, and {{with a mix of}} English and Tagalog songs were soon used. Projected lyrics on <b>TV</b> <b>screens</b> became very common as the main source of karaoke renditions. These tapes were soon replaced by CD+Gs, but a plug-n-play karaoke microphone that housed a factory built-in songchip loaded with hundreds of karaoke songs quickly became a favourite. This unit would usually be purchased in the Philippines and brought into Australia, becoming a common household item and is popularly used during gatherings.|$|E
25|$|Duel Live {{made use}} of the {{original}} outdoor queue line, often with other actors roaming the wooded area. For the 2008 version, the queue featured gravediggers and werewolves creeping up on the guests, though in 2009 this was reduced to one actor in a hooded robe. Guests waited at the door instead of walking straight in, before being greeted by either a maid or a butler (the performers alternated during the 2009 version, but in 2008 only the butler featured) and given a brief talk about what was inside and why the guns were switched off. The <b>TV</b> <b>screens</b> in the Drawing Room were covered with cloth and muted, and the original spooky music turned up; the room being similar {{to what it was}} in the original Haunted House.
