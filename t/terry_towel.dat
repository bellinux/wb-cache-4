Consumer opinions on preference of type of towels for aesthetic value were obtained. Chi Square statistical test was utilized for comparative analysis based on marital status, age, educational level, and family income. Fifty per cent of the respondents owned velour bath towels: of these 52 per cent rated velour towels as not very absorbent. All of the respondents owned <b>terry</b> cloth <b>towels</b> and 70 per cent of these rated terry cloth as very absorbent. The majority of the respondents who used fabric softeners stated the fabric softener made no difference in the absorbency of the towels. Velour towels were preferred for aesthetic value, but the overall preference was for the <b>terry</b> cloth <b>towels.</b> The laboratory investigation included weight, and wick-up tests. The results revealed that terry cloth was superior to velour in absorbency. The addition of fabric softeners greatly reduced the absorbability of both types of towels. Light weight <b>towels,</b> <b>terry</b> cloth and velour, are more absorbent than are heavy weight towels...|$|R

30|$|Among many {{developing}} countries that actively participate in textiles and apparel trade, the Indian textile industry is exhibiting significant growth potential in the global market with its advantage as low production costs, abundant resources of raw material and cheap labor forces. The textiles and apparel industry is India’s second largest industry which consists of spinning, apparel, garment, and man-made fabrics manufacturing. The country is the largest exporter of <b>terry</b> <b>towels</b> and man-made textile products. However, with an increased level of competition from low-cost manufacturers (especially China) around the world, the industry is under tremendous pressure to increase productivity, to improve performance, to improve production quality and to advance the management systems.

40|$|The {{transfer}} of gram-positive bacteria, particularly multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), among patients {{is a growing}} concern. One critical aspect of bacterial transfer {{is the ability of}} the microorganism to survive on various common hospital surfaces. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the survival of 22 gram-positive bacteria (vancomycin-sensitive and -resistant enterococci and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococci) on five common hospital materials: smooth 100 % cotton (clothing), 100 % cotton <b>terry</b> (<b>towels),</b> 60 % cotton– 40 % polyester blend (scrub suits and lab coats), 100 % polyester (privacy drapes), and 100 % polypropylene plastic (splash aprons). Swatches were inoculated with 104 to 105 CFU of a microorganism, assayed daily by placing the swatches in nutritive media, and examining for growth after 48 h. All isolates survived for at least 1 day, and some survived for more than 90 days on the various materials. Smaller inocula (102) survived for shorter times but still generally for days. Antibiotic sensitivity had no consistent effect on survival. The long survival of these bacteria, including MRSA and VRE, on commonly used hospital fabrics, such as scrub suits, lab coats, and hospital privacy drapes, underscores the need for meticulous contact control procedures and careful disinfection to limit the spread of these bacteria...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this pilot study was to {{evaluate}} the performance of reusable absorbent body-worn products for adults with moderate/heavy urinary incontinence, compare their performance {{with a group of}} equivalent disposable products, and establish the need for a larger statistically robust study. Setting and Subjects: Ten men and 4 women living in the community were recruited from locations throughout the United Kingdom. Methods: A randomized multiple crossover design was used in which all subjects were given the opportunity to test each product. All the products were available on the UK market in January 2001. The following tools were used in the evaluation: a product performance questionnaire and a pad leakage diary. Overall opinion was used as the primary outcome indicator. Results: The reusable Paddy T was the best performing product overall, outperforming the disposable products. For low leakage and good absorbency (the most important product attributes identified by the subjects), the disposable all-in-one product performed best during the day. However, the Paddy T performed best for night use. The remaining reusable products performed poorly overall. Conclusions: Reusable products for moderate/heavy incontinence remain unpopular for use in isolation. Surprisingly, a product manufactured from <b>terry</b> <b>toweling,</b> a traditional material, performed relatively well. Reusables may provide a useful alternative to disposable products in certain circumstances. The results from this study do not support a more comprehensive costly study...|$|R

40|$|Most of {{the textile}} {{industries}} {{in developing countries}} are facing a big problem of noise pollution and vibration. The assessment of noise pollution and vibration in textile industries has been {{the aim of this}} study and Textile Mill is chosen as the case study. The investigation was concerned with the noise exposure and its adverse effects to workers at the mill. The findings revealed that about 30 % of the Textile Mill employees are working in hazardous environments of above 90 dB, which is the recommended safe limit of noise in the working environment for 8 h used in Mill. In this regard, a programme which includes different methods of how to control the problem has been proposed for conserving hearing and vibration at the factory. The methods include modification of the noise and vibration source by providing viscoelastic epoxy resin sound damping coating, repair of machines, and periodic audiometric testing. This paper presents an efficient method to determine sound power levels (PWLs) measured by sound level meter(SLM) near the noise sources generated by the simultaneous operation of <b>Terry</b> <b>towel</b> machine and Time–frequency analysis, including the wavelet transform, is one of the new and powerful tools in the important field of structural health monitoring, using vibration analysis.

The topic of my internship report is- “The Inventory Management System and financial performance evaluation of Shabab Fabrics Limited. ” Shabab Fabrics {{is one of the}} well known towel manufacturing company in Bangladesh. It is producing the quality towel products and distributed all over our country. Shabab Fabrics is renown in international market to export <b>terry</b> <b>towel</b> products. Like other manufacturing companies SFL also collect raw materials from own premise and abroad. Therefore, inventory purchase and management system is one of the significant issues for SFL. To produce their products they need more than 100 direct and indirect materials. To purchase their inventory they do some of the tasks in orderly like prepare budget, prepare purchase order then negotiated with supplier and finally purchase Raw materials. Then to proper manage of this inventory they also need to do some tasks like received raw materials, issue raw materials, finished goods received, finished goods disburse, reconciliation of raw materials and then if any sales return have. By monitoring this system, they can get proper value of inventory, though some other issues may need to consider. SFL and its group company FMYDL and their sister concern CREA use common warehouse for storage their inventory. Therefore, SFL cannot differentiate their warehouse cost; carrying costs, which mislead SFL cost of goods sold and gross profit value. They have more than 100 categories of raw materials and for every single category, they need to calculate lead-time individually and maintain safety stock, which also create obstacle for proper inventory management. Moreover, lack of proper planning and coordination and Troyee software limitation they are not able to get the accurate value of inventory and cost of goods sold. Therefore, it will be more beneficiaries for SFL if they can identify their warehouse cost separately and allocate them properly. Another most important issue for SFL is performance analysis of in every year and takes decision for improvement. To do so ratio calculation and analysis {{is one of the key}} mechanisms. To clear about SFL financial position calculated current ratio, Net working capital, Return on Assets, Return on Equity, Profit Margin, Gross profit Margin, Assets Turnover Ratio, Account Receivable Turnover Ratio, Inventory Turnover, and Debt to Equity, Debt Ratio and Fixed Assets Turnover Ratio.
