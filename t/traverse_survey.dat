The transit method of traverse adjustment was adopted using Visual Basic Language.

This information will help to improve {{the understanding of the}} hydrological role of these ubiquitous clastic dikes at the Hanford Site. We collected 100 MHz {{ground penetrating radar}} (GPR) 3 -D surface reflection data at two sites, the 216 -S- 16 (S- 16) Pond and the Army Loop Road sites, and 2 -D reflection data along a 6. 9 km linear transect (Traverse site) near the Army Loop Road site. The dikes are distinguished in the GPR data by a strongly attenuated zone, disruptions in the continuity of reflections, and diffractions where reflections are disrupted. In general, the data quality is better at the Army Loop Road and Traverse sites than at the S- 16 Pond site, probably due to the presence of cobbles at the S- 16 Pond site. A high-moisture, fine-grained unit probably causes the strong reflections at the Army Loop Road site and the <b>Traverse</b> <b>survey</b> site.

40|$|The 21 st Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE- 21, 1979 - 1981) {{made several}} {{explosion}} seismic experiments by installing seismic stations along the S-H-Z route from Syowa to Mizuho Stations, on which JARE- 14 (1972 - 1974) {{had made the}} <b>traverse</b> <b>survey.</b> Most of the seismic stations were selected to be closely located near the traverse stations, so that the position of each traverse station could be determined {{from that of a}} nearby seismic station determined by the NNSS positioning. By comparing the positions of selected traverse stations thus determined in 1980 with those determined in 1973,the flow velocity of the ice sheet along the S-H-Z route was estimated. Since the method of positioning and the referred geodetic coordinates by JARE- 21 were not identical with those by JARE- 14,several assumptions were made in the data reduction procedure and in the estimate of the flow velocity. The obtained magnitude of flow in 1973 - 1980 ranges from 108 m with 290 ° flow direction at S 27 - 3 to 475 m with 267 ° flow direction at Z 2 with the uncertainty of at most± 14 % for the flow value and ± 13 °for the flow direction. The change of the height at each traverse station ranges from - 3. 5 m at H 17 to + 8. 8 m at H 253 with about 10 m uncertainty. Topographical features of the obtained flow velocity are discussed in view of the comparison with previously obtained flow velocity, the flow lines deduced from the surface topography, the strain field measured near the route and the free-air gravity anomalies over the Mizuho Plateau...|$|E

40|$|After the 921 Earthquake {{occurred}} in 1999, the relative position of original satellite control points and mapping control points {{have been changed}} due to collision, distortion, dislocation and other factors. Therefore, in land survey correction, the arranged mapping control points before earthquake cannot be restored for survey. TWD 97 {{is often used to}} reconstruct mapping control points in the resurvey area, but this system cannot integrate with survey using TWD 67 before earthquake. This study aims to solve this problem. This study adopted periphery triangulation points of the experiment area and pre-seismic basic control points as basis for reconstruction of basic control points. The remaining point position which serves as common points and rearranged basic control points were used for static survey of GPS satellite positioning. Furthermore, trilateration survey was used to calculate error compensation of survey girds. Comparison analysis was conducted for coordinates of common point location of basic control points before and after earthquake to find out the ground movement after earthquake and evaluate feasibility of design schemes. According to the evaluation results, TWD 97 was used to survey and reconstruct mapping control points after disaster, and single <b>traverse</b> <b>survey</b> was used to recalculate TWD 67 coordinates of point location. The bundle adjustment was used to restore TWD 67 coordinates system before earthquake, and extract conversion parameters and standard deviations of common points so as to provide results of TWD 97 coordinates system and TWD 67 coordinates system for future reference for arrangement of mapping control points in disaster area. The results indicated that four parameters model and least square method is desirable. Average precision of the conversing results of values in the resurvey areas was within 6 cm, which meets the precision requirements of land survey correction stipulated in Article 73 of Regulations for Cadastral Survey. 自從 88 年 921 大地震後原有衛星控制點、圖根點，因擠壓、扭曲、錯動等種種因素導致相對位置產生變化，致辦理土地複丈時，無法恢復地震前布設之圖根點施測，數值重測區補建圖根點時多係採用TWD 97 坐標系統為測量基準與原重測前TWD 67 系統無法接軌，爰有本研究之動機。 研究方法係採用實驗區外圍三角點及地震前布設之基本控制點為依據，辦理基本控制點清理補建，利用殘存點位為共同點加入重新布設之基本控制點辦理GPS衛星定位靜態測量，並應用當時重測時據以計算之三角三邊測量程式作網形平差計算，比較分析地震前後之基本控制點共同點位坐標，了解地震後地層位移量，評估設計可行方案，根據評估結果連測災後補建TWD 97 圖根點，單導線測量重新計算點位TWD 67 坐標，以整體平差方式恢復地震前之TWD 67 坐標系統，萃取出共同點之轉換參數及標準差，期能提供較均勻之TWD 97 坐標系統與TWD 67 坐標系統成果，以提供日後災區圖根布設參考。 經由研究成果得知轉換結果以四參數及最小二乘配置法轉換模式較好；數值重測區轉換成果相對位置平均精度可達 ± 6 公分以內，符合地籍測量實施規則 73 條規定辦理土地複丈之精度要求。目 錄 摘要…………………………………………………… [...] …………iii Abstract…………………………………………………. ……… [...] iv 表目錄…………………………………………………… [...] ……. viii 圖目錄………………………………………………………. ………ix 第一章 緒論…………………………………………………………. 1 第一節 前言. ……………………………………………… [...] 1 第二節 研究動機與目的……………………………………… 2 一、研究動機…………………………………………… [...] 2 二、研究目的……………………………………………… 2 三、研究假設……………………………………………… 3 第三節 研究方法……………………………………………… 3 第二章 文獻回顧……………………………………………………. 5 第三章 研究理論與方法…… [...] ………………… [...] …… 10 第一節 衛星定位測量原理…………………………………. 10 一、全球定位系統………………………………………. 10 二、GPS衛星定位測量方法……………………………… 13 三、e-GPS即時動態定位系統…………………………… 15 四、虛擬基準站即時動態定位技術（VRS-RTK）……… 16 第二節 TWD 67 與TWD 97 大地基準……………………………. 18 一、TWD 67 大地基準……………………………………… 18 二、TWD 97 大地基準……………………………………… 19 第三節 坐標轉換…………………………………………… 21 一、四參數坐標轉換……………………………………. 21 二、六參數坐標轉換……………………………………. 22 三、七參數坐標轉換……………………………………. 22 第四節 三角三邊測量………………………………………. 23 第五節 最小二乘配置法……………………………………. 24 第六節 統計測試……………………………………………. 25 第四章 研究流程與成果分析…………………………………… [...] 28 第一節 研究流程………………………………………. …… 28 一、已知點檢測…………………………………………. 28 二、基本控制點清理補建…………………………… [...] . 31 三、靜態GPS測量與成果計算分析…………………… [...] 33 四、控制點整體平差計算TWD 97 坐標…………………… 34 五、控制點坐標轉換TWD 67 坐標………………………… 35 六、圖根點單導線計算TWD 67 坐標……………………… 35 七、圖根點整體平差計算TWD 67 坐標…………………… 36 八、成果精度分析…………………………. …… [...] …… 36 九、各實驗區實地檢測驗證……………………………. 36 十、結果分析…………………… [...] …. ………………… 37 第二節 實驗區簡介…………………………………………. 37 第三節 研究過程……………………………………………. 39 一、已知三角點計算分析………………………………. 39 二、基本控制點計算………………… [...] ………………. 44 三、控制點坐標轉換比較分析…………………………. 45 第四節 成果及精度分析……………………………………. 47 第五節 實驗區實地檢測成果………………………………. 50 第六節 統計分析……………………………………………. 55 第五章 結論與建議…………………… [...] . ………… [...] . 56 第一節 結論…………………… [...] . ………… [...] 56 第二節 建議…………………… [...] . ………… [...] 57 參考文獻…………………… [...] . …… [...] 58 附錄一：四參數轉換與整體平差較差比較表…………………. 61 附錄二：六參數轉換與整體平差較差比較表…………………. 8...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{history of}} New York State {{cartography}} {{from the post}} Revolutionary years into {{the early nineteenth century}} exhibits similarities and differences in problems and approaches when compared to the other thirteen original colonies. Accurate surveying and mapping was essential for two related reasons: the new republic was short of funds and needed to raise money, and it had to payoff veterans who had served the length of the war for the promise of land. Mapmakers had some sources to draw on, but information was spotty, recorded at different scales, and suffered from a variety of problems in accu racy.

40|$|Using Interim Geophysical Data Record (IGDR) of SEASAT radar altimetry, a {{configuration}} {{map of the}} Antarctic {{ice sheet}} in the area bounded by 30 °and 80 °E and latitude 72 °S is compiled. A total of 7480 footprint data of every second sampling (6. 62 km apart) along 63 subsatellite groundtracks are obtained in the area. The area was divided into rectangles with side lengths of 0. 1 °in latitude and 0. 4 °in longitude, and the average elevation above sea level by SEASAT altimetry data within the rectangle is used for computer-aided contouring. Since the height error for 147 crossover points on the ice sheet was± 6. 7 m in standard deviation, and height errors from slope-induced effect and other sources were 20 m, the contour interval of 100 m was chosen for an inland area higher than 500 m above sea level. The obtained configuration resembles the map published by the Scott Polar Research Institute (1983). A total of 157 ground survey data from triangulation survey, satellite Doppler positioning and previously published topographic map are used to estimate an overall accuracy of the obtained configuration map. The ground survey height is on an average 2. 2 m lower than the SEASAT-derived elevation {{with a standard deviation}} of ± 21. 5 m, which may reflect the limited data quality of IGDR without retracking correction of the return-pulse waveform.

This study aims to find the effects of traffic activity on the intensity of the urban heat island through a case study done on the city of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The data relative to the traffic activity in the city of Kuala Lumpur is gathered from Malaysian Governmental sources. While, two methodologies combined to study the urban heat island of the city; weather station networks method and <b>traverses</b> <b>survey</b> method. The study shows that, there is an increase in the intensity of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) of the city of Kuala Lumpur since last similar studies done during 1985 to this study in December 2004. The increase of the intensity of the UHI of the city is 1. 5 o C. On the other hand, there is a gradual increase on the traffic activity since 1984 to 2004. The study shows that, the number of registered vehicles in the city increases from 85, 000 vehicles in 1984 to more than 2, 000, 000 vehicles by 2004. In addition to that, the largest portion of vehicles registered in the city are cars (about 52 %), then motorcycles (34 %), and buses and taxis together (1. 6 %). However, this small percentage of public transport vehicle carries about 20 % of the total daily trips in Kuala Lumpur. Therefore, this study concludes that, the UHI of the city is directly proportional to the number of cars and motorcycles vehicles and inversely proportional to public transport vehicles. The study shows that, the higher the percentage of registered vehicles in the city, the higher is the intensity of the UHI. Thus the intensity of the UHI of the city is directly proportional to the number of registered vehicles in the city.

To test which of these possibilities was the most likely, a more detailed drainage survey of the Afon Dulyn and Llyn Eigiau areas was carried out. Stream sediment, panned concentrate and stream water samples were collected from each of 28 sites and analysed for a range of elements which included copper, lead and zinc in all three sample types, and iron, manganese and barium in sediments and concentrates. Readings were taken of the pH in stream water and soil at many points in the area. In addition, ground magnetic <b>traverses</b> were <b>surveyed</b> in the Foe 1 Fras and Drosgl areas where there are known to be positive aeromagnetic anomalies. The analytical results were examined in some detail by various statistical methods, from which it was concluded that most of the high zinc in stream sediment results were related to hydrous oxide precipitates. The distribution of elements in a few samples showed some indications of mineralisation, but mineralogical examination of the panned concentrates from these sites found no mineral phases which could be related directly to mineralisation or contamination, zinc occurring mainly in iron oxide coatings. It is thus apparent that a source of zinc exists in the general area, perhaps on the wide interfluves, but it is not known whether this source is dispersed or concentrated (i. e. mineralisation) ...|$|R

The surveys were conducted by three teams, one for each of the following: 1) Vegetation Survey and Mapping 2) Aquatic Habitats and Fauna 3) Terrestrial Fauna Fieldwork for these surveys were undertaken in the last two weeks of September 1996 and the first week of October 1996. The vegetation and terrestrial fauna teams travelled together for 14 days. The aquatic team travelled separately for a total of 9 days. After the ground-based fieldwork was complete, the leader of each of the three teams participated in three days of helicopter <b>surveys,</b> <b>traversing</b> the pipeline route, including corridor, from the Palmer River to Townsvill...|$|R
50|$|Then on 30 June 1880 Poeppel and his {{survey party}} began the westward survey along the 26th {{parallel}}, running {{a series of}} 10-mile chords and setting the mileposts on the arc of the parallel by calculated offsets. They experienced many hardships on {{this section of the}} <b>survey</b> <b>traversing</b> Australia's most inhospitable country - the vast waterless plains of the Sturt Stony Desert and the salt lakes and sand hills of the Simpson Desert. Their diet was salt beef and damper causing all to develop scurvy. They relied on Aboriginal people to guide them to wells as water was so scarce. They reached the final corner at 26 degrees South 138 degrees East, marking it with a timber post by the end of 1880. Drought forced them to return to Adelaide. Later the South Australian Triangulation Survey reached the border and on checking the mileposts, discovered an error in chainage and the corner post was relocated from the salt lake, Lake Poeppel, to its foreshore. Starting in 1883 Poeppel and Wells began the survey of the Queensland- South Australian border along meridian 141 degrees E.|$|R
40|$|Culverts {{have been}} used for a number of decades in Europe and the USA to reduce {{wildlife}} road-kills. In Australia, culverts have been employed by road authorities only relatively recently. This study used sand-strip surveys to investigate wildlife usage of nine purpose-built culverts along a 1. 4 -km section of the Pacific Highway at Brunswick Heads, north-east New South Wales. Surveys during two eight-day periods in spring and summer 2000 found 1202 traverses by wildlife through the culverts. Frequent culvert users were bandicoots (25 % of traverses), rats (25 %), wallabies (13 %) and cane toads (14 %). All culverts were used by these species, suggesting that at least several individuals of each species were involved. Infrequent users (each < 2 % of crossings) were possums, echidnas, lizards, birds and introduced carnivores. A koala was recorded crossing on two occasions. The long-nosed potoroo was observed in the surrounding habitat but was not confirmed <b>traversing</b> the culverts. <b>Surveys</b> for road-kills on this road section suggest that the exclusion fence bordering the highway prevented mammal road-kills and channeled mammals to the culverts. A single survey on a wet night found many frogs crossing the road surface and many were killed. This study confirms that culverts and exclusion fencing facilitate safe passage across a road for a range of wildlife species. This suggests that this form of management response to extensive road mortality of wildlife is appropriate and should be adopted more widely. However, this form of mitigation is not effective for frogs. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentNo Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|The Life in the Atacama project {{investigated}} the regional distribution {{of life and}} habitats in the Atacama Desert of Chile. We sought to create biogeologic maps through <b>survey</b> <b>traverses</b> across the desert using a rover carrying biologic and geologic instruments. Elements of our science approach were to: Perform ecological transects from the relatively wet coastal range to the arid core of the desert; use converging evidence from science instruments to reach conclusions about microbial abundance; and develop and test exploration strategies adapted to the search of scattered surface and shallow subsurface microbial oases. Understanding the ability of science teams to detect and characterize microbial life signatures remotely using a rover became central to the project. Traverses were accomplished using an autonomous rover in a method that is technologically relevant to Mars exploration. We present {{an overview of the}} results of the 2003, 2004, and 2005 field investigations. They include: The confirmed identification of microbial habitats in daylight by detecting fluorescence signals from chlorophyll and dye probes; the characterization of geology by imaging and spectral measurement; the mapping of life along transects; the characterization of environmental conditions; the development of mapping techniques including homogeneous biological scoring and predictive models of habitat location; the development of exploration strategies adapted to the search for life with an autonomous rover capable of up to 10 km of daily traverse; and the autonomous detection of life by the rover as it interprets observations on-the-fly and decides which targets to pursue with further analysis...|$|R
