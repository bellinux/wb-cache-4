5|$|Six years later, the Court {{reviewed}} another restriction, {{this time}} concerning funding restrictions imposed {{by a public}} university. In the 1997 case Rosenberger v. University of Virginia, a government supported university sought to withhold funds from religious student publications despite funding similar secular publications. While <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> the government could seek to shape funding to support a government message, such restrictive steps could not be imposed {{to the exclusion of}} a particular viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Ginsberg's conviction, {{ruling that}} the New York State Legislature was not {{required}} to prove a tangible negative impact on youth from exposure to sexually explicit material. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> the New York State Legislature only needed to assume that such an impact existed. Justice William O. Douglas wrote a dissenting opinion in the case, criticizing the New York law. He concluded he knew individuals who fit the definition of juvenile delinquent but were fifty years old, and extrapolated {{the impact of the}} decision could be expanded to affect adults and multiple organizations in society instead of just youths.|$|E

5000|$|In Diamond v. Chakrabarty, the United States Supreme Court {{held that}} a genetically-altered living {{microorganism}} was patent-eligible subject matter. <b>The</b> Chakrabarty <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "we must determine whether respondent's micro-organism constitutes a 'manufacture' or 'composition of matter' {{within the meaning of}} <b>the</b> statute. <b>The</b> <b>Court's</b> answer to its question was yes----"respondent's micro-organism plainly qualifies as patentable subject matter."

25|$|Cooper v. Oklahoma, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court {{reversed}} an Oklahoma court decision holding that a defendant is presumed to be competent to stand trial unless he proves otherwise by the second highest legal standard of proof, that of clear and convincing evidence, ruling that to be unconstitutional. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>said</b> the defendant's Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process were violated.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> that Swamy had {{the locus}} standi to seek {{sanction}} from the Prime Minister {{for the prosecution}} of A Raja in the 2G scam.

In <b>the</b> <b>court’s</b> dicta for Kwock Jan Fat v.

25|$|In Static Control Components, Inc. v. Lexmark Int’l, Inc., 615 F.Supp.2d 575 (E.D.

25|$|In the Civil Rights Cases (1883), the Supreme Court allowed {{segregation}} by {{striking down}} the Civil Rights Act of 1875, a statute that prohibited racial discrimination in public accommodation. It again {{held that the}} Equal Protection Clause applied only to acts done by states, not to those done by private individuals, and as the Civil Rights Act of 1875 applied to private establishments, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>said,</b> it exceeded congressional enforcement power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E

25|$|On June 2, 1952, the Supreme Court {{handed down}} its decision. In Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952)—a {{landmark}} {{case on the}} scope of presidential powers—the Court ruled that the president lacked the authority to seize the steel mills. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> the President had no authority under the Constitution to seize private property during national emergency. Absent a declaration of war, the President required Congressional authorization to seize the steel mills, and this the chief executive lacked.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} argument, the Court again {{sided with the}} respondents. It noted that, indeed, five of the Justices had {{advocated}} a reconsideration of Aguilar when deciding another case. However, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>said,</b> this did not necessarily mean {{there had been a}} change in their jurisprudence or reasoning, because Aguilar's propriety was not in question when those comments were made. The Court stated that the views of its members, outside of a judgment to this effect, did not constitute a change in Establishment Clause law.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} {{statutory}} language incorporates all the refinements {{associated with the}} language, is a shorthand description of the worker's legal rights. The Court explained that if the petitioner's logic was used, {{there would be no}} stopping point because all contracts would have to spell out every intricacy of every term in the contract. Contracts would thus become massive, and yet there would be no real benefit from the increase in mass. The Court decided that it was perfectly reasonable for the union to use terms of art in a contract.|$|E

The justices <b>said</b> <b>the</b> Chancery <b>court</b> judge erroneously considered Dennis Dobbs' lawsuit as an appeal of his assault conviction prosecuted in another county. <b>The</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> Dobbs' tort, for what he referred to as [...] "inhumane" [...] conditions at the Marshall County prison warranted a hearing.|$|R

In Rodriguez and Matlock the police obtained voluntary consent from a co-occupant at the residence and found evidence implicating another resident {{who was not}} present when the police obtained consent. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> that the present case {{was different from the}} previous two in that the co-resident was not present to refuse consent to the search. In Rodriguez the co-occupant who later objected to the search was asleep in a bedroom within the residence; in Matlock, the later-objecting co-occupant was located in a nearby police vehicle.|$|E
25|$|NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co. 304 U.S. 333 (1938) is a 7-0 {{decision}} by the United States Supreme Court which held that workers who strike remain employees {{for the purposes of}} the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The Court granted the relief sought by the National Labor Relations Board, which sought to have the workers reinstated by the employer.

25|$|On April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court {{handed down}} a {{decision}} ruling constitutional the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote for the}} five-justice majority that Congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure, although the Court left {{open the door for}} as-applied challenges. Kennedy, writing for the court, implied but did not absolutely reach the question whether the Court's prior decisions in Roe v. Wade, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and Stenberg v.
