5|$|On the ground, <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Royal Lao Army had {{initially}} {{been given the}} responsibility of stopping, slowing, or, at the very least, observing the enemy's infiltration effort. In Laos the agency began Operation Pincushion in 1962 for that reason. The operation evolved into Operation Hardnose, in which CIA-backed Laotian irregular reconnaissance team operations took place.|$|E
5|$|Kennan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to perform his job in Belgrade. President Josip Broz Tito and his foreign minister, Koča Popović, began to suspect that Kennedy would adopt an anti-Yugoslav policy during his term. Tito and Popović considered Kennedy's decision to observe Captive Nations Week as an indication that the United States would assist anticommunist liberation efforts in Yugoslavia. Tito also believed that <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Pentagon were the true directors of American foreign policy. Kennan attempted to restore Tito's confidence in the American foreign policy establishment but his efforts were compromised by a pair of diplomatic blunders, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and the U-2 spy incident.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the coming}} years, several organisations, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> West German Government, attempted to locate Bormann without success. In 1964, the West German government offered a reward of 100,000 Deutsche Marks for {{information leading to}} Bormann's capture. Sightings were reported at points all over the world, including Australia, Denmark, Italy, and South America. In his autobiography, Nazi intelligence officer Reinhard Gehlen claimed that Bormann had been a Soviet spy, and that he had escaped to Moscow. Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal believed that Bormann was living in South America. The West German government declared that its hunt for Bormann was over in 1971.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{had little}} {{personal}} expertise on foreign matters, Truman listened closely to his top advisors, especially George Marshall and Dean Acheson. He won bipartisan support for both the Truman Doctrine, which formalized a policy of Soviet containment, and the Marshall Plan, which aimed to help rebuild postwar Europe. To get Congress to spend the vast sums necessary to restart the moribund European economy, Truman used an ideological argument, arguing that Communism flourishes in economically deprived areas. As part of the U.S. Cold War strategy, Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947 and reorganized military forces by merging the Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (later the Department of Defense) and creating the U.S. Air Force. The act also created <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> National Security Council. In 1952, Truman secretly consolidated and empowered the cryptologic elements of the United States by creating the National Security Agency (NSA).|$|E
5|$|Argo is a 2012 {{political}} thriller {{directed by}} Ben Affleck, and produced by Grant Heslov, Affleck and George Clooney. The screenplay by Chris Terrio {{was adapted from}} sections of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operative Tony Mendez's memoir The Master of Disguise: My Secret Life in <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 2007 Wired article The Great Escape by Joshuah Bearman on the Canadian Caper. The film stars Affleck as Mendez, who attempts to rescue six United States diplomats from Tehran, Iran, during the 1979–81 Iran hostage crisis by pretending that {{they are part of}} a film crew scouting the country for the filming of a fictitious science-fiction film, Argo. Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman feature in supporting roles.|$|E
5|$|Interviews with {{communities}} {{from both}} sides of the political divide indicate how Chávez is seen by the rich and poor. The latter support his stated aim to redistribute the country's oil wealth; the former fear totalitarianism and are worried Chávez will institute communism. In February 2002, the media war intensifies after Chavez takes control of PDVSA. The film states that the company was previously run as a private interest for the benefit of a minority, despite being state-owned. Business leader Pedro Carmona and union boss Carlos Ortega are the main voices of the opposition. After the pair visit Washington, D.C., <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> State Department express concern about Chávez's rule and stress the importance of Venezuela's oil. A Venezuelan general appears on private television to voice similar disquiet. Carmona appeals for a public protest at the offices of PDVSA.|$|E
50|$|After Smith, who was Eisenhower's World War II Chief of Staff, {{consolidated}} <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> <b>the</b> OPC <b>and</b> <b>the</b> OSO in 1952, the Eisenhower administration began narrowing <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> {{latitude in}} 1954. In accordance {{with a series}} of National Security Council directives, the Director of Central Intelligence's responsibility for the conduct of covert operations was further clarified. President Eisenhower approved NSC 5412 on March 15, 1954, reaffirming <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> responsibility for conducting covert actions abroad". A series of committees, containing representatives from State, Defense, <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> <b>and</b> sometimes <b>the</b> White House or NSC, reviewed operations. Over time and reorganizations, these committees were called the Operations Coordinating Board (OCB), NSC 5412/2 Special Group or simply Special Group, Special Group (Augmented), 303 Committee, and Special Group (Counterinsurgency).|$|R

5|$|The {{first phase}} of the {{operation}} began soon after Árbenz's resignation on June 27, 1954, with several agents being dispatched to Guatemala beginning on July 4. These included agents of <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Office of Intelligence Research (OIR). The first phase involved the collection of 150,000 documents from sources including Árbenz's personal possessions, trade union offices, and police agencies. The ruling military junta led by Carlos Castillo Armas aided these efforts. Following a presentation made to US President Dwight Eisenhower on July 20, a decision was taken to accelerate the operation, and the number of people working in Guatemala was increased. The new team members posed as unaffiliated with the US government to maintain plausible deniability. The operation helped set up the Guatemalan National Committee of Defense Against Communism, which was covertly funded by the CIA: agents of the committee became involved in PBHistory. The team studied over 500,000 documents in total, and finished processing documents on 28 September 1954.|$|E
5|$|For 100 months, the U.S. Air Force, <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Thai {{government}} had assisted the Royal Lao government in staving off defeat {{at the hands}} of its enemies. If one measures the success of Barrel Roll by the priorities assigned to it by the U.S. government and military, it was a success. It had allowed the continuous prosecution of the Steel Tiger (and, post-1968, Operation Commando Hunt) interdiction campaigns against the Ho Chi Minh trail by keeping the neutralists in power. At the time of the cease-fire, communist forces controlled two-thirds of the land area and one-third of the population of Laos, approximately the same amounts that they had under their control in 1961. The imposition of a strategic stalemate had prevented the fall of the Vientiane government, which accomplished the secondary goal of the operation, protecting Thailand from communist attack (however unrealistic that threat appears today). This stalemate had been achieved with the loss of 131 U.S. aircraft between 1964 and 1973, a very low loss rate when compared to the operations discussed above.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Revolutionary Front had based a 1,400-strong army, Brigade 2506, in Nicaragua. On {{the night}} of April 16 to 17, Brigade 2506 landed along Cuba's Bay of Pigs, and engaged in a firefight with a local revolutionary militia. Castro ordered Captain José Ramón Fernández to launch the counter-offensive, before taking {{personal}} control of it. After bombing the invaders' ships and bringing in reinforcements, Castro forced the Brigade to surrender on April 20. He ordered the 1189 captured rebels to be interrogated {{by a panel of}} journalists on live television, personally taking over the questioning on April 25. 14 were put on trial for crimes allegedly committed before the revolution, while the others were returned to the U.S. in exchange for medicine and food valued at U.S. $25 million. Castro's victory was a powerful symbol across Latin America, but it also increased internal opposition primarily among the middle-class Cubans who had been detained {{in the run-up to the}} invasion. Although most were freed within a few days, many fled to the U.S., establishing themselves in Florida.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1956 Games Jackson {{began working}} {{overseas}} with the Central Intelligence Agency, first in Germany where {{he joined the}} Rhein-Main Gun Club.

Following his activities in Europe, he settled down in Annandale, Virginia, resumed his CIA duties in Washington, D.C., and {{became a member of the}} Fairfax Gun Club. He was sent to the Republic of China in 1962, and then Japan the following year, before he was able to return to Virginia in 1965, but by 1968 he was back in Japan for a four-year stint. He next spent two years in the Panama Canal Zone before retiring from <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Air Force with the rank of Lieutenant colonel at the end of 1974 and soon moved to Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. From 1978 through 1983 he took up work as a shooting instructor and coach around New England and continued competing in tournaments through the 1990s. In 2011 was the presenter for the National Rifle Association's Henry Fulton Trophy, awarded to the highest scorer in the team match of their Palma Championship. He was made a member of the Connecticut State Rifle and Revolver Association Shooters Hall of Fame in 1985 and the United States International Shooting Hall of Fame in 1999. The Arthur C. Jackson Trophy, awarded by the NRA to the highest scorer at the World Black Powder Long Range International Championships, is named in his honor.
