The difference between the <b>two</b> <b>materials</b> is small enough to warrant a linear-response treatment: Owing to this feature, chemical and elastic effects can be studied independently. Our main finding is that the band offset is a bulk property, depending only upon the macroscopic strain present in the <b>two</b> <b>materials</b> far from the interface, and independent of any interface feature, such as abruptness, interface strain, or buckling. In agreement with previous work, our results also indicate that the strain variations affect only weakly the valence-band offset, when it is measured between the averages of the split manifolds in the <b>two</b> <b>materials.</b> <b>Starting</b> from these reference levels, simple band-structure effects are responsible for a rather large strain-induced tunability of the offset between the topmost valence states...|$|R

Making the assumption of pressure equilibration, the author arrives at equations which predict that mixing will begin, even in the limit of small initial perturbations, and even in a 1 -d calculation, when an interface goes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable, unless the drag or material strength forces are sufficiently large to prevent this. The equations given here may be incorporated into 1 -d, 2 -d, or 3 -d codes, for either Lagrangian or Eulerian formulation.
