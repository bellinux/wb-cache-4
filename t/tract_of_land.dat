Clark served as the first chairman of the Clarksville, Indiana, board of trustees. Clark was unable to retain title to his landholdings. At the end of his life, he was poor, in ill health, and frequently intoxicated.|$|E
50|$|The {{taxpayer}} {{challenged the}} IRS's determination, {{claiming that the}} IRS erroneously determined the proper allocation of his basis between the two <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and that the IRS erroneously allocated the amounts that were placed in escrow for improvements between the two <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>land.</b>|$|R
50|$|Corporations {{sometimes}} set up land trusts {{when they}} want to compile large <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> without arousing suspicion or alerting people to their plans (which would cause the asking price to rise).

5|$|Hemlock trees form {{a canopy}} over Big Wapwallopen Creek in some places. The Wapwallopen Gorge {{is listed as}} a Locally Significant site on the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory. Hemlock and yellow birch are common at the gorge's upper end. However, river birch and {{sycamore}} are more common {{at the lower end}} of the gorge. There are riparian forests along Big Wapwallopen Creek in the American Legion Post 781 land tract. The <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> also contains some wet areas such as vernal pools and marshes. These areas provide breeding grounds for reptiles, amphibians, fish, and aquatic invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|In 1758 the State of New Jersey {{purchased}} the Indian title to lands in that State, {{and as a}} consideration for the purchase, bought a <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> as a residence for the Indians, having previously passed an act declaring that such lands should not be subject thereafter to any tax by the State, any law or usage, or law then existing, to the contrary notwithstanding.

The settlers at Fort Vienna frequently clashed with the Shawnee who used the area as a hunting ground. The Rowans would remain at Fort Vienna for six years.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{creation}} of Woodford County, Marshall moved within its borders and was appointed county surveyor by Virginia Governor Beverley Randolph. In this capacity, he surveyed and claimed significant additional tracts of land, becoming one of Kentucky's most wealthy citizens.

He was also supposed to have boasted that he measured his silver coinage by the peck, not having time to count the individual coins.|$|E
5|$|The French and Indian War (1754–1763) and the {{subsequent}} colonial expansion encouraged the migration of many Native Americans westward to the Ohio River basin.

5|$|The land in question, {{which had}} been part of the Seneca Nation's {{traditional}} territory for centuries before the American Revolution, comprised part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase, a <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> disputed after the war between claims of New York and Massachusetts.

5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{watershed}} of Darby Creek is on developed land, and many suburbs of Philadelphia are in the watershed. The majority (61%) of the land use is considered residential, while 11% is undeveloped and 10% is open space. Of the remaining land, most of it is considered industrial, commercial, and institutional, with 2.45% classified as paved. Estimates for the population of the watershed range from 484,000 to 500,000.

5|$|D Charitable Foundation was {{established}} by Borislow in 1997 with a $21 million stock donation. In the first two years, he tried to use the charity to buy and preserve a <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> in New Hope, Pennsylvania. This venture failed in 1998 when the property owner declined Borislow's offer. Following this, D made donations to the Clearwater Endoscopy Center and the Center for Digestive Healthcare in Clearwater, Florida until 2001. Since then, it has issued varied grants to causes Borislow supported, such as $2.75 million to two yeshivas and $173,450 to a West Palm Beach, Florida private school. Tax records indicate that Borislow and George Farley, {{the chief financial officer}} of the non-profit, split approximately $2.1 million in profits from 2001-2005, while $1.6 million went to charitable causes. Borislow drew criticism in 2007 when he paid himself $1.7 million through the charity.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of the British and their Indian allies in western Canada, Harrison and Lewis Cass, {{governor}} of the Michigan Territory, were delegated the responsibility for negotiating a peace treaty with the Indians, known as the Treaty of Greenville (1814). In June 1815, at President Madison's request, the U.S. government appointed Harrison to serve as one of the commissioners responsible for negotiating a second postwar treaty with the Indians that became known as the Treaty of Spring Wells (1815). Both treaties were advantageous to the United States. In the Spring Wells treaty the tribes ceded a large <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> in the west, providing additional land for American purchase and settlement.|$|E

5|$|NY198 {{became a}} westward {{extension}} of NY252 on January1, 1949, and Clifton Road was renamed to Paul Road {{in the early}} 1950s. NY252 was rerouted in the late 1950s to follow a new, more southerly alignment through Chili. The former routing of NY252 between Chili Center and NY383 was redesignated as NY252A even though it did not directly connect to NY252, its implied parent route. In the late 1960s, the then-Rochester–Monroe County Airport expanded its primary runway southward across a <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> that included part of NY252A's routing. As a result, NY252A was moved onto a new alignment that circumvented the runway to the south.|$|E
5|$|The congregation's first church {{building}} was erected beginning in May 1823 and consecrated {{a few months}} later on 19 November 1823 by the Rt Rev'd John Croes, Bishop of New Jersey. This building was located at the corner of Church and Main streets, on a <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> conveyed to the congregation by William T. Anderson, a local attorney. The Gothic structure was described as small; it accommodated 250 worshipers. Toward the end of Pettit's tenure, the congregation was compelled to build a new {{church building}} as their current building had become unstable and unsafe.

5|$|Benjamin Harrison died in 1791. William Henry {{dropped the}} study of {{medicine}} and used Benjamin's connections with the Founding Fathers to get a commission in the Army. The seat {{of the federal government}} was then in Philadelphia, and President Washington granted him a commission. Harrison served under Mad Anthony Wayne, fighting against Native Americans in what is now western Ohio. He was promoted to captain and made commander of Fort Washington before returning to civilian life in 1798, disliking garrison duty. He was already seeking another position through his government connections, and the same year was appointed by President John Adams as secretary of the Northwest Territory. The following year, the territorial legislature narrowly elected him the territory's delegate to Congress. In 1800, the Indiana Territory was separated from the Northwest, and Harrison was made territorial governor by President Adams, a position he would hold for over a decade. Prior to taking office, he bought a large <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> from his father-in-law, along the Ohio River at North Bend. When Harrison purchased it, there was a log cabin on the property, but by 1840 the structure had been absorbed into the mansion that stood there.|$|E
