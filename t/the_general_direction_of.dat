5|$|Crazy Taxi and its sequels are score attack {{games that}} all employ the same {{fundamental}} rules and mechanics. The player controls {{one of several}} taxi drivers in a fictional city, looking for fares and then taking them to their destination in the fastest time possible. The player must perform this while time still remains on an overall gameplay clock. Passengers looking for rides are indicated by an overhead marker that is colored to represent the distance to their intended destination. The color marker ranges from red indicating short trips, to yellow for intermediate distances, and to green indicating long ones. When a passenger is picked up, the player is awarded additional time on the countdown time. Furthermore, a second countdown timer is started, representing how quickly the passenger needs to be at their destination. While a passenger is in the taxi, a large green arrow is shown on the player's HUD that points in <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the passenger's destination to help guide the player through the map.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Favio was {{the first}} known {{tropical}} cyclone that passed south of Madagascar to strike Africa as an intense tropical cyclone. Early on February11, 2007, a zone of disturbed weather formed east of Madagascar. Four days later, Favio was named as intensified to a moderate tropical storm while moving southwest. On February18, the storm was upgraded into a severe tropical storm. Then, it turned west in <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> Mozambique. Continuing to intensify, Favio was upgraded to a tropical cyclone early on February19. Subsequently, the storm began to undergo rapid deepening; the small storm reached intense tropical cyclone status the next day before peaking in intensity. However, the cyclone had weakened somewhat prior to making landfall on February22 in the Inhambane Province in Mozambique. It rapidly weakened over land and dissipated the next day.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Patterson {{engaged in}} a gun duel with the Japanese column. Patterson {{received}} a shell hit aft, causing moderate damage and killing 10 crew members. Patterson continued to pursue and fire at the Japanese ships and may have hit Kinugasa, causing moderate damage. Patterson then {{lost sight of the}} Japanese column as it headed northeast along the eastern shore of Savo Island. Bagley, whose crew sighted the Japanese shortly after Patterson and Canberra, circled completely around to port before firing torpedoes in <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the rapidly disappearing Japanese column; one or two of which may have hit Canberra. Bagley played no further role in the battle. Yūnagi exchanged non-damaging gunfire with Jarvis before exiting the battle area to the west with the intention of eventually rejoining the Japanese column north and west of Savo Island.|$|E
5|$|The 37mm M5 gun had a {{manually}} operated breechblock. The tank commander doubled as loader, {{like many other}} tanks of the time. There was no turret basket in the M2A4 light tank; the commander stood on the right side, while the gunner stood on the left side. The commander turned the turret onto <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> target. The gunner would then bring the target into the M5 telescopic sight. The M20 combination mount had 20° of traverse; this could either be by a handwheel driving the rack and pinion traverse gear mechanism or pressure on the gunners shoulder rest overcoming the friction in the mechanism. Depression and elevation of the gun was either through a geared mechanism or, with the gears disengaged, free through movement of the gunner's shoulder rest.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Judy, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Susang, was the third {{tropical}} cyclone to affect Japan during the 1982 Pacific typhoon season. Forming east of the Philippines in tandem with another system on September4, the disturbance continued to intensify, and was upgraded into a tropical storm early on September6 and a typhoon on September8 while tracking northwestward. On September9, Judy attained its peak intensity, with winds of 150km/h (90mph). Thereafter, increased wind shear took a toll on the typhoon, as it turned northward on September11 in <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> Japan {{under the influence of}} a mid-latitude cyclone. Judy passed over southeastern Japan on September12; by this time, the typhoon had weakened considerably. Judy became an extratropical cyclone almost immediately thereafter.|$|E

Prefabricated building, just like classical building, is a constituent part of the new process in the formation of settlements.
