5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hypothyroidism without any lumps or masses felt within the <b>thyroid</b> gland {{does not require}} <b>thyroid</b> imaging; however, if the <b>thyroid</b> feels abnormal, diagnostic imaging is then recommended. The presence of antibodies against <b>thyroid</b> peroxidase (TPO) makes {{it more likely that}} <b>thyroid</b> nodules are caused by autoimmune thyroiditis, but if there is any doubt, a needle biopsy may be required.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, <b>thyroid</b> cancer {{presents}} as a painless {{mass in the}} neck. It is {{very unusual}} for <b>thyroid</b> cancers to present with other symptoms, although in some cases cancer may cause hyperthyroidism. Most malignant <b>thyroid</b> cancers are papillary, followed by follicular, medullary, and <b>thyroid</b> lymphoma. Because of the prominence of the <b>thyroid</b> gland, cancer is often detected earlier {{in the course of}} disease as the cause of a nodule, which may undergo fine needle aspiration. <b>Thyroid</b> function tests will help reveal whether the nodule produces excess <b>thyroid</b> hormones. A radioactive iodine uptake test can help reveal the activity and location of the cancer and metastases.|$|E
5|$|Physicians who specialise in the {{treatment}} of <b>thyroid</b> disorders are known generally as endocrinologists, <b>thyroid</b> specialists or thyroidologists. <b>Thyroid</b> surgeon or otolaryngologistss {{may play a role in}} the surgical management of <b>thyroid</b> disease and general practitioners and family physicians may play a role in monitoring for and identifying symptoms related to <b>thyroid</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{superior}} parathyroid glands {{receive their}} {{blood from the}} inferior <b>thyroid</b> arteries. The inferior parathyroid glands receive a variable blood supply, from either the ascending branch of the inferior <b>thyroid</b> arteries or the <b>thyroid</b> ima artery. The inferior <b>thyroid</b> artery arises from the subclavian arteries.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thyroid</b> gland, {{or simply}} the <b>thyroid,</b> is an {{endocrine}} gland in the neck, {{consisting of two}} lobes connected by an isthmus. It is found {{at the front of}} the neck, below the Adam's apple. The <b>thyroid</b> gland secretes <b>thyroid</b> hormones, which primarily influence the metabolic rate and protein synthesis. The hormones also have many other effects including those on development. The <b>thyroid</b> hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are created from iodine and tyrosine. The <b>thyroid</b> also produces the hormone calcitonin, which plays a role in calcium homeostasis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thyroid</b> ima artery {{was first}} defined by German anatomist Johann E. Neubauer {{in the year}} 1772. Hence, it was named the <b>thyroid</b> artery of Neubauer. The artery {{originates}} lower than the inferior <b>thyroid</b> arteries, so it {{is also known as}} the lowest <b>thyroid</b> artery.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thyroid</b> is {{supplied}} with arterial {{blood from the}} superior <b>thyroid</b> artery, {{a branch of the}} external carotid artery, and the inferior <b>thyroid</b> artery, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, and sometimes by an anatomical variant the <b>thyroid</b> ima artery, which has a variable origin. The superior <b>thyroid</b> artery splits into anterior and posterior branches supplying the <b>thyroid,</b> and the inferior <b>thyroid</b> artery splits into superior and inferior branches. The superior and inferior <b>thyroid</b> arteries join together behind the outer part of the <b>thyroid</b> lobes. The venous blood is drained via superior and middle <b>thyroid</b> veins, which drain to the internal jugular vein, and via the inferior <b>thyroid</b> veins. The inferior <b>thyroid</b> veins originate in a network of veins and drain into the left and right brachiocephalic veins. Both arteries and veins form a plexus between the two layers of the capsule of the <b>thyroid</b> gland.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thyroid</b> cancers {{are treated}} by {{removing}} the whole or part of <b>thyroid</b> gland. Radioactive Iodine 131 may be given to radioablate the <b>thyroid.</b> Thyroxine is given to replace the hormones lost and to suppress TSH production, as TSH may stimulate recurrence. With {{the exception of the}} rare anaplastic <b>thyroid</b> cancer, which carries a very poor prognosis, most <b>thyroid</b> cancers carry an excellent prognosis and can even be considered curable.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} tests {{that can be used}} to test the {{function}} of the <b>thyroid,</b> for the presence of diseases, and for the success or failure of treatment. Blood tests in general aim to measure <b>thyroid</b> function or determine the cause of <b>thyroid</b> dysfunction. <b>Thyroid</b> function tests include a battery of blood tests including the measurement of the <b>thyroid</b> hormones T3 and T4, as well as the measurement of TSH. They may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4 with a low TSH).|$|E
5|$|About 20,000 protein coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in human cells and 70% of these genes {{are expressed in}} the normal <b>thyroid.</b> Some 250 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the <b>thyroid</b> with about 20 genes being highly <b>thyroid</b> specific. The corresponding specific proteins are mainly involved in <b>thyroid</b> hormone synthesis, such as thyroglobulin, TPO and IYD, and expressed in follicular cells. Other proteins elevated in the <b>thyroid</b> are calcitonin related proteins such as CALCA and CALCB, expressed in the parafollicular c-cells.|$|E
5|$|Another {{disorder}} {{is that of}} <b>thyroid</b> dysgenesis which can result in various presentations {{of one or more}} misplaced accessory <b>thyroid</b> glands. These can be asymptomatic.|$|E
5|$|Desiccated <b>thyroid</b> extract is an animal-based <b>thyroid</b> gland extract, most {{commonly}} from pigs. It {{is a combination}} therapy, containing forms of T4 and T3. It also contains calcitonin (a hormone produced in the <b>thyroid</b> gland involved in the regulation of calcium levels), T1 and T2; these are not present in synthetic hormone medication. This extract was once a mainstream hypothyroidism treatment, but its use today is unsupported by evidence; British <b>Thyroid</b> Association and American professional guidelines discourage its use.|$|E
5|$|Determination of TPO {{antibodies}} may {{be considered}} {{as part of the}} assessment of recurrent miscarriage, as subtle <b>thyroid</b> dysfunction can be associated with pregnancy loss, but this recommendation is not universal, and presence of <b>thyroid</b> antibodies may not predict future outcome.|$|E
5|$|Each {{parathyroid}} vein drains {{into the}} superior, middle and inferior <b>thyroid</b> veins. The superior and middle <b>thyroid</b> veins drain into the internal jugular vein, and the inferior <b>thyroid</b> vein drains into the brachiocephalic vein.|$|E
5|$|Estrogen {{levels may}} affect <b>thyroid</b> behavior. For example, during the luteal phase (when {{estrogen}} levels are lower), {{the velocity of}} blood flow in the <b>thyroid</b> is lower than during the follicular phase (when estrogen levels are higher).|$|E
5|$|Excessive {{production}} of the <b>thyroid</b> hormones is called hyperthyroidism, which is most commonly a result of Graves' disease, a toxic multinodular goitre, a solitary <b>thyroid</b> adenoma, or inflammation. Other causes include drug-induced excess of iodine, particularly from amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic medication; an excess caused by the preferential uptake of iodine by the <b>thyroid</b> following iodinated contrast imaging; or from pituitary adenomas which may cause an over{{production of}} <b>thyroid</b> stimulating hormone. Hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of non-specific symptoms including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, palpitations, anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause chest pain, diarrhoea, hair loss and muscle weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism, {{also called}} underactive <b>thyroid</b> or low <b>thyroid,</b> {{is a common}} {{disorder}} of the endocrine {{system in which the}} <b>thyroid</b> gland does not produce enough <b>thyroid</b> hormone. It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called cretinism.|$|E
5|$|In 1500 polymath Leonardo da Vinci {{provides}} the first {{illustration of the}} <b>thyroid.</b> In 1543 Anatomist Andreas Vesalius gave the first anatomic description and illustration of the gland. In 1656 the <b>thyroid</b> received its name, by the anatomist Thomas Wharton. The gland was named <b>thyroid,</b> meaning shield, as its shape resembled the shields commonly used in Ancient Greece. The English name <b>thyroid</b> gland {{is derived from the}} medical Latin used by Wharton – glandula thyreoidea. Glandula means gland in Latin, and thyreoidea {{can be traced back to}} the Ancient Greek word θυρεοειδής, meaning shield-like/shield-shaped.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{widespread}} {{screening of}} the general population is a matter of debate. Some organizations (such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force) state that evidence is insufficient to support routine screening, while others (such as the American <b>Thyroid</b> Association) recommend either intermittent testing above a certain age in both sexes or only in women. Targeted screening may be appropriate in a number of situations where hypothyroidism is common: other autoimmune diseases, a strong family history of <b>thyroid</b> disease, those who have received radioiodine or other radiation therapy to the neck, those who have previously undergone <b>thyroid</b> surgery, those with an abnormal <b>thyroid</b> examination, those with psychiatric disorders, people taking amiodarone or lithium, and those with a number of health conditions (such as certain heart and skin conditions). Yearly <b>thyroid</b> function tests are recommended in people with Down syndrome, as they are at higher risk of <b>thyroid</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|In {{tetrapod}}s, the <b>thyroid</b> {{is always}} found {{somewhere in the}} neck region. In most tetrapod species, there are two paired <b>thyroid</b> glands – that is, {{the right and left}} lobes are not joined together. However, there is only ever a single <b>thyroid</b> gland in most mammals, and the shape found in humans is common to many other species.|$|E
5|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common cause of primary hypothyroidism and endemic goiter worldwide. In areas of the world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis). Hashimoto's may be associated with a goiter. It is characterized by infiltration of the <b>thyroid</b> gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific <b>thyroid</b> antigens such as <b>thyroid</b> peroxidase, thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{management}} of hyperthyroidism may include drugs that suppress <b>thyroid</b> function such as propylthiouracil, carbimazole and methimazole. Radioactive iodine-131 {{can be used}} to destroy <b>thyroid</b> tissue. Radioactive iodine is selectively taken up by the <b>thyroid,</b> which over time destroys the cells involved in its uptake. The chosen first-line treatment will depend on the individual and on the country where being treated. Surgery to remove the <b>thyroid</b> can sometimes be performed as a transoral thyroidectomy, a minimally-invasive procedure. Surgery does however carry a risk of damage to the parathyroid glands and the nerves controlling the vocal cords. If the entire <b>thyroid</b> gland is removed, hypothyroidism will naturally result, and <b>thyroid</b> hormone substitutes will be needed.|$|E
5|$|Other {{variants}} {{include a}} levator muscle of <b>thyroid</b> gland, connecting the isthmus {{to the body}} of the hyoid bone, and the presence of the small <b>thyroid</b> ima artery.|$|E
5|$|Pregnancy {{leads to}} marked changes in <b>thyroid</b> hormone physiology. The gland is {{increased}} in size by 10%, thyroxine production is increased by 50%, and iodine requirements are increased. Many women have normal <b>thyroid</b> function but have immunological evidence of <b>thyroid</b> autoimmunity (as evidenced by autoantibodies) or are iodine deficient, and develop evidence of hypothyroidism {{before or after}} giving birth.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{there is}} a third lobe present called the {{pyramidal}} lobe. When present, this lobe often stretches up the hyoid bone from the <b>thyroid</b> isthmus and may be one to several divided lobes. The presence of this lobe ranges in reported studies from 18.3% to 44.6%. It was shown to more often arise from the left side and occasionally separated. The pyramidal lobe is also known as Lalouette's pyramid. The pyramidal lobe is a remnant of the thyroglossal duct which usually wastes away during the <b>thyroid</b> gland's descent. Small accessory <b>thyroid</b> glands may in fact occur anywhere along the thyroglossal duct, from the foramen cecum of the tongue to the position of the <b>thyroid</b> in the adult. A small horn {{at the back of the}} <b>thyroid</b> lobes, usually close to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the inferior <b>thyroid</b> artery, is called Zuckerkandl's tubercle.|$|E
5|$|The infrahyoid muscles lie {{in front}} of the gland and the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the side. Behind the outer wings of the <b>thyroid</b> lie the two carotid arteries. The trachea, laryngx, lower pharynx and {{esophagus}} all lie behind the <b>thyroid.</b> In this region, the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the inferior <b>thyroid</b> artery pass next to or in the ligament.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{underlying}} form of <b>thyroid</b> disease associated with TPP is Graves' disease, a syndrome {{due to an}} autoimmune reaction that leads to overproduction of <b>thyroid</b> hormone. TPP has also been described in people with other <b>thyroid</b> problems such as thyroiditis, toxic nodular goiter, toxic adenoma, TSH-producing pituitary adenoma, excessive ingestion of thyroxine or iodine, and amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism.|$|E
5|$|The nerve {{receives}} {{close attention}} from surgeons since during neck surgery, especially <b>thyroid</b> and parathyroid surgery, the nerve {{is at risk}} for injury. Nerve damage can be assessed by laryngoscopy, during which a stroboscopic light confirms the absence of movement in the affected side of the vocal cords. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve is more susceptible to damage during <b>thyroid</b> surgery because it {{is close to the}} bifurcation of the right inferior <b>thyroid</b> artery, variably passing in front of, behind, or between the branches. The nerve is permanently damaged in 0.33% of <b>thyroid</b> surgery, and transiently in 38% of surgeries, {{and is one of the}} leading causes of medicolegal issues for surgeons.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thyroid</b> gland is {{the only}} source of <b>thyroid</b> hormone in the body; the process {{requires}} iodine and the amino acid tyrosine. Iodine in the bloodstream is taken up by the gland and incorporated into thyroglobulin molecules. The process is controlled by the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin), which is secreted by the pituitary. Not enough iodine, or not enough TSH, can result in decreased production of <b>thyroid</b> hormones.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thyroid</b> may be {{affected}} by several diseases. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the gland produces excessive amounts of <b>thyroid</b> hormones, {{the most common cause}} being Graves' disease — an autoimmune disorder. In contrast, hypothyroidism is a state of insufficient <b>thyroid</b> hormone production. Worldwide, the most common cause is iodine deficiency. <b>Thyroid</b> hormones are important for development, and hypothyroidism secondary to iodine deficiency remains the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability. In iodine-sufficient regions, {{the most common cause of}} hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's thyroiditis—also an autoimmune disease. In addition, the <b>thyroid</b> gland may also develop several types of nodules and cancer.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thyroid</b> sits {{near the}} front of the neck, lying against and around the front of the larynx and trachea. The <b>thyroid</b> {{cartilage}} and cricoid cartilage lie just above the gland, below the Adam's apple. The isthmus extends from the second to third rings of the trachea, with the uppermost part of the lobes extending to the <b>thyroid</b> cartilage, and the lowermost around the fourth to sixth tracheal rings. The <b>thyroid</b> gland is covered by a thin fibrous capsule, which has an inner and an outer layer. The outer layer is continuous with the pretracheal fascia, attaching the gland to the cricoid and <b>thyroid</b> cartilages, via a thickening of the fascia to form the posterior suspensory ligament of <b>thyroid</b> gland also known as Berry's ligament. This causes the <b>thyroid</b> to move up and down with swallowing. The inner layer extrudes into the gland and forms the septae that divides the <b>thyroid</b> tissue into microscopic lobules. Typically four parathyroid glands, two on each side, lie on each side between the two layers of the capsule, {{at the back of the}} <b>thyroid</b> lobes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thyroid</b> follicles {{are small}} spherical groupings of cells 0.02–0.9mm in {{diameter}} that play the main role in <b>thyroid</b> function. They {{consist of a}} rim that has a rich blood supply, nerve and lymphatic presence, that surrounds a core of colloid that consists mostly of <b>thyroid</b> hormone precursor proteins called thyroglobulin, an iodinated glycoprotein.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thyroid</b> hormone is {{required}} for the normal functioning of numerous tissues in the body. In health, the <b>thyroid</b> gland predominantly secretes thyroxine (T4), which is converted into triiodothyronine (T3) in other organs by the selenium-dependent enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase. Triiodothyronine binds to the <b>thyroid</b> hormone receptor in the nucleus of cells, where it stimulates the turning on of particular genes and the production of specific proteins. Additionally, the hormone binds to integrin αvβ3 on the cell membrane, thereby stimulating the sodium–hydrogen antiporter and processes such as formation of blood vessels and cell growth. In blood, almost all <b>thyroid</b> hormone (99.97%) is bound to plasma proteins such as thyroxine-binding globulin; only the free unbound <b>thyroid</b> hormone is biologically active.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thyroid</b> hormones act by {{crossing}} the cell membrane and binding to intracellular nuclear <b>thyroid</b> hormone receptors TR-α1,TR-α2,TR-β1 and TR-β2, which bind with hormone response elements and transcription factors to modulate DNA transcription. In {{addition to these}} actions on DNA, the <b>thyroid</b> hormones also act within the cell membrane or within cytoplasm via reactions with enzymes, including calcium ATPase, adenylyl cyclase, and glucose transporters.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thyroid</b> hormones {{to treat}} goiters: In 239 BC, Master Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals stated that where water is too light, people suffer {{widespread}} baldness and goiter. It {{was not until}} the 1860 that French physician Gaspard Adolphe Chatin (1813–1901) linked goiter with the lack of iodine in soil and water; iodine was discovered in the <b>thyroid</b> gland in 1896 by German chemist Eugen Baumann, while <b>thyroid</b> extract was used to treat patients in 1890. The Tang Dynasty (618–907) physician Zhen Quan (d. 643 AD), in his Old and New Tried and Tested Prescriptions, stated that the <b>thyroid</b> glands taken from gelded rams were used to treat patients with goiter; the <b>thyroid</b> hormones could be swallowed in pill form (the body of the pill made from crushed jujube pulp) or as a solid <b>thyroid</b> gland with the fat taken off. The Pharmacopoeia of the Heavenly Husbandman asserted that iodine-rich sargassum was used to treat goiter by the 1st century BC (Ge Hong, 284–364, also suggested using a tincture derived from sargassum seaweed in about 340 AD), a treatment later recorded in the West by Italian practrica Roger of Palermo in his Practica Chirurgiae of 1180 AD.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of the <b>thyroid</b> disease usually {{leads to}} {{resolution}} of the paralytic attacks. Depending {{on the nature of}} the disease, the treatment may consist of thyrostatics (drugs that reduce production of <b>thyroid</b> hormone), radioiodine, or occasionally <b>thyroid</b> surgery.|$|E
