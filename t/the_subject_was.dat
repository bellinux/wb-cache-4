5|$|During the Enlightenment, {{intellectual}} {{sympathy for}} astrology fell away, {{leaving only a}} popular following supported by cheap almanacs. One English almanac compiler, Richard Saunders, followed {{the spirit of the}} age by printing a derisive Discourse on the Invalidity of Astrology, while in France Pierre Bayle's Dictionnaire of 1697 stated that <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> puerile. The Anglo-Irish satirist Jonathan Swift ridiculed the Whig political astrologer John Partridge.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{distributed}} element filters {{began in}} the years before World WarII. A major paper on <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> published by Mason and Sykes in 1937. Mason had filed a patent much earlier, in 1927, and that patent may contain the first published design which moves away from a lumped element analysis. Mason and Sykes' work was focused on the formats of coaxial cable and balanced pairs of wires – the planar technologies were not yet in use. Much development was carried out during the war years driven by the filtering needs of radar and electronic counter-measures. A good deal of this was at the MIT Radiation Laboratory, but other laboratories in the US and the UK were also involved.|$|E
5|$|Dodd's career {{returned}} to politically contentious Indigenous issues {{when he played}} a minor role, of Kummengu, in the 1991 film Deadly.

5|$|Drapier's Letters is the {{collective}} {{name for a}} series of seven pamphlets written between 1724 and 1725 by the Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, Jonathan Swift, to arouse public opinion in Ireland against the imposition of a privately minted copper coinage that Swift believed to be of inferior quality. William Wood was granted letters patent to mint the coin, and Swift saw the licensing of the patent as corrupt. In response, Swift represented Ireland as constitutionally and financially independent of Britain in the Drapier's Letters. Since <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> politically sensitive, Swift wrote under the pseudonym M. B., Drapier, to hide from retaliation.|$|E

40|$|Among {{philosophical}} {{approaches to}} <b>the</b> notion of <b>subject,</b> {{at least three}} main historical stages may be distinguished: at the metaphysical stage, the structure of <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> that of a substance; at the transcendental stage (Kant and Fichte), <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> viewed as a unifying polarity of horizons; at the psychoanalytical stage, <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> defined as a gap structure. <b>The</b> transcendental <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> a structure for the world, whereas <b>the</b> psychoanalytical <b>subject</b> {{needs to have a}} structure in itself to structure its own ontological lack. For Lacan, this ontological lack is made manifest through language. The structure of <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> conceived as a structure of signification.

5|$|In September 1944, Wu was {{contacted}} by the Manhattan District Engineer, Colonel Kenneth Nichols. The newly commissioned B Reactor at the Hanford Site had run into an unexpected problem, starting up and shutting down at regular intervals. John Archibald Wheeler suspected that a fission product, xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.4 hours, was the culprit, and might be a neutron poison. Segrè then remembered the work that Wu had done at Berkeley on the radioactive isotopes of xenon. The paper on <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> still unpublished, but Wu and Nichols went to her dorm room, and collected the typewritten draft prepared for the Physical Review. Xenon-135 was indeed the culprit; {{it turned out to}} have an unexpectedly large neutron absorption cross-section.|$|E
5|$|In his new positions, Khrushchev {{continued}} his kolkhoz consolidation scheme, which decreased {{the number of}} collective farms in Moscow province by about 70%. This resulted in farms that were too large for one chairman to manage effectively. Khrushchev also sought to implement his agro-town proposal, but when his lengthy speech on <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> published in Pravda in March 1951, Stalin disapproved of it. The periodical quickly published a note stating that Khrushchev's speech was merely a proposal, not policy. In April, the Politburo disavowed the agro-town proposal. Khrushchev feared that Stalin would remove him from office, but the leader mocked Khrushchev, then allowed the episode to pass.|$|E
5|$|Proto-Mayan {{is thought}} to have had a basic verb–object–subject word order with {{possibilities}} of switching to VSO in certain circumstances, such as complex sentences, sentences where object and subject were of equal animacy and when <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> definite. Today Yucatecan, Tzotzil and Tojolab'al have a basic fixed VOS word order. Mamean, Q'anjob'al, Jakaltek and one dialect of Chuj have a fixed VSO one. Only Ch'orti' has a basic SVO word order.

5|$|The {{positioning}} of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> contemporary, but the poses {{of some of the}} figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while studying in Paris, and would have been sympathetic to its depiction of male bathers in a modern setting.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have varied}} interpretations of Marshall's vice presidency. Claire Suddath rated Marshall {{as one of}} the worst vice presidents in American history in a 2008 Time {{magazine}} article. Samuel Eliot Morison wrote that had Marshall carried out his constitutional duties, assumed the presidency, and made the concessions necessary for the passage of the League of Nations treaty in late 1920, the United States would have been much more involved in European affairs and could have helped prevent the rise of Adolf Hitler, which began in the following year. Morison {{and a number of other}} historians claim that Marshall's decision was an indirect cause of the Second World War. Charles Thomas, one of Marshall's biographers, wrote that although Marshall's assumption of the presidency would have made World War II much less likely, modern hypothetical speculation on <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> unfair to Marshall, who made the correct decision in not forcibly removing Wilson from office, even temporarily.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October the RPF {{suffered}} a significant reversal, when leader Fred Rwigyema {{was shot in}} the head and killed. There is a dispute about the exact circumstances of Rwigyema's death; the official line of Kagame's government, and the version mentioned by historian Gérard Prunier in his 1995 book on <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> <b>was</b> that Rwigyema was killed by a stray bullet. In his 2009 book Africa's World War, however, Prunier states that it is likely Rwigyema was killed by his subcommander Peter Bayingana, following an argument over tactics. According to this account, Rwigyema was conscious of the need to move slowly, and attempt to win over the Hutu in Rwanda before assaulting Kigali, whereas Bayingana and fellow subcommander Chris Bunyenyezi, wished to strike hard and fast, to achieve power as soon as possible; the argument boiled over, causing Bayingana to shoot Rwigyema dead. Another senior RPF officer, Stephen Nduguta, witnessed this shooting and informed President Museveni; Museveni sent his brother Salim Saleh to investigate, and Saleh ordered Bayingana and Bunyenyezi's arrest and eventual execution.|$|E

5|$|Scholars have {{attempted}} {{for more than}} a century to understand who is portrayed in this painting. Earlier proposals that <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> John III Sobieski (who would have been eight years old in 1637) or Stephen Bathory (who died in 1586) have been discredited. According to Otakar Odložilík, while the man in the painting is clearly wearing Polish garb, it is neither certain who he is, nor whether he is a Pole. Odložilík's research on this issue suggested that the painting may be that of Andrzej Rej, a Polish noble and diplomat of that era who passed through Amsterdam, the Netherlands, where Rembrandt was working, at the time the painting was created. Nonetheless, without any documents from that era clearly acknowledging that fact, as Odložilík noted, it may never be known for certain who the subject really is.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{itself was}} {{formally}} {{introduced to the}} House of Commons on 4 March 1907. <b>The</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> debated in the House of Lords on 21 March, where the proposed changed to the Militia were strongly opposed. The bill had its second reading in the Commons on 9, 10, and 23 April, and was passed into Committee, where it was discussed at some length over nine days. The opposition to the bill, whilst verbose, was not very effective. Hugh Arnold-Forster, the previous War Secretary, argued that the Territorial Force would prove ineffective in opposition to conscripted Continental armies, whilst the Labour Party objected generally to any increase in military strength. Most of the opposition came from partisans of the existing system; {{as well as the}} implacable opposition from the Militia element, supporters of the Yeomanry objected to the reduction in their daily rates (from 5s. 6d. to 2s. 8d.), whilst Sir Howard Vincent led the opposition from the Volunteers against the stricter control of the new regulations. However, the strong Liberal majority saw off all opposition, and the bill moved for a third reading on 19 June, where it passed with 286 votes to 63. The opposition was mainly led by the Irish MPs, who voted against the government for reasons unrelated to the bill, and some of the Labour Party; most of the Unionists, save a few like Vincent or Charles Dilke, abstained rather than oppose.|$|E
5|$|The first biographical {{sketch of}} Friedrich Accum's life {{was written by}} the American {{agricultural}} chemist and historian of science Charles Albert Browne, Jr. in 1925. He studied the life and works of Accum closely for ten years, which {{he was able to}} complement with information from civil and ecclesiastical sources in Bückeburg. His enthusiasm for <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> so great that he traveled to Germany in July 1930 to meet with Hugo Otto Georg Hans Westphal (August 26, 1873 – September 15, 1934), a great-grandson of Accum's. Brown's last writing on the subject, which appeared in 1948 in Chymia, a journal for the history of chemistry, relied to a great extent on the information he gathered from Hugo Westphal. Three years later, R. J. Cole published an outline of Accum's life based on English sources. He was particularly concerned with bringing new information to light about the judicial process of 1821. Like Browne, Cole also provided relatively little data about the last part of Accum's life in Berlin. A modern presentation of Accum's life and works that fills in the lacuna in the available biographies has not been written. Lawson Cockroft of the Royal Society of Chemistry in London observed that Friedrich Accum was one of those chemists who, despite significant achievements in his lifetime, was by and large forgotten today.|$|E

5|$|The {{study of}} glaciovolcanism {{is still a}} {{relatively}} new field. Early accounts described the unusual flat-topped steep-sided volcanoes (called tuyas) in Iceland that were suggested to have formed from eruptions below ice. The first English-language paper on <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> published in 1947 by William Henry Mathews, describing the Tuya Butte field in northwest British Columbia, Canada. The eruptive process that builds these structures, originally inferred in the paper, begins with volcanic growth below the glacier. At first the eruptions resemble those {{that occur in the}} deep sea, forming piles of pillow lava {{at the base of the}} volcanic structure. Some of the lava shatters when it comes in contact with the cold ice, forming a glassy breccia called hyaloclastite. After a while the ice finally melts into a lake, and the more explosive eruptions of Surtseyan activity begins, building up flanks made up of mostly hyaloclastite. Eventually the lake boils off from continued volcanism, and the lava flows become more effusive and thicken as the lava cools much more slowly, often forming columnar jointing. Well-preserved tuyas show all of these stages, for example Hjorleifshofdi in Iceland.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject of}} a {{permanent}} capital for the United States was discussed numerous times during the years immediately following the Revolutionary War, however, the Continental Congress could never agree on a site due to regional loyalties and tensions. In September 1788, the Congress of the Confederation selected New York City as the nation's temporary capital under the incoming federal government. The framers of the Constitution granted the new U.S. Congress exclusive governing jurisdiction over a federal district, intentionally separate from not beholden to any state. The Constitution, however, said nothing about where it would be. Discussions during the 1st Congress about where to locate the permanent seat of government revolved around two locations: one site on the Potomac River near Georgetown; and another site on the Susquehanna River near Wrights Ferry (now Columbia, Pennsylvania). The Susquehanna River site {{was approved by the}} House in September 1789, while legislation under consideration in the Senate specified a site on the Delaware River near Germantown, Pennsylvania. No agreement was reached, and <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> deferred until the second session.|$|E
5|$|Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE was {{the brainchild}} of Nintendo {{producer}} Kaori Ando, who voiced her wish to make a Fire Emblem crossover to fellow producer Hitoshi Yamagami in 2010. Ando's initial vision was for a collaboration between the Fire Emblem and Pokémon series, but this was rejected as a similar collaboration was being developed in the form of Pokémon Conquest. Ando redrafted her proposal and submitted it a week later as a crossover between Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tensei. Atlus, the developer of the Shin Megami Tensei series, had previously worked with Nintendo on a game titled Itsumo Purikura ☆ Kuradeko Puremium for the Nintendo DSi and 3DS. When the project was originally pitched to Atlus in 2010, it was assumed that they were not interested after their unenthusiastic response and later said they were too busy to undertake the collaboration. Over a year later, Atlus inquired as to whether <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> still open for discussion, and it transpired that they had been highly enthusiastic while still being too busy with other projects. Shinjiro Takada, who was also working on , was appointed as producer. While he had viewed Fire Emblem as a rival and quality goal for his own work, he was honored to be given the chance to develop a title related to Fire Emblem. The game's directors were Mitsuru Hirata, who was supporting director on , and Eiji Ishida, who worked on both Strange Journey and Shin Megami Tensei IV. Hirata was originally the project's sole director, but seven months after the game's public announcement, Ishida was brought on to co-direct so the amount of work needed for the title could be managed. According to Ishida, it was the company's first original game for eighth-generation consoles. Full development began in 2013. From conception to release, production on Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE lasted five years.|$|E
