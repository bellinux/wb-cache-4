5|$|According to Sharon, {{there is}} no mention of Deir Ghassaneh or Beit Rima in early Arabic sources, {{although}} it is known that Deir Ghassaneh was inhabited during the Mamluk period due to the many houses <b>there</b> <b>that</b> have preserved elements of Mamluk architecture. Specific examples include the use of the ablaq technique of alternating stones of different colors, particularly red and white, that decorate the facades and gates of some houses.|$|E

Some scenes were shot against a green screen background for second unit footage of other locations to be substituted, allowing the use of crane shots.

Visual effects were done by the same company <b>there</b> <b>that</b> had done them for the 2006 South Korean monster film, The Host.|$|E

5|$|As {{is typical}} for ceratosaurs, the abelisaurid hand had four basic digits. However, it is <b>there</b> <b>that</b> any {{similarity}} ends. No wrist bones existed, {{with the four}} palm bones (metacarpals) attaching directly to the forearm. There were no finger bones on the first or fourth digits, only one on the second digit and two on the third digit. These two external fingers were extremely short and immobile. Manual claws were very small in Eoabelisaurus, and totally absent in carnotaurines.|$|E

The public can visit the reserve throughout the year. Besides examining the collections, they can view birds from hides and observatories and take part in educational activities.|$|E
