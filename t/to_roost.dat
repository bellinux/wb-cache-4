5|$|Cape sparrows prefer <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> in nests, {{and while}} {{wandering}} {{outside of the}} breeding season, birds in uncultivated areas roost socially in old nests or dense bushes. In farmland and towns, Cape sparrows build special nests for roosting, lined more poorly than breeding nests but incorporating a greater quantity of insulating material.|$|E
5|$|Like other bleeding-hearts, the Sulu bleeding-heart is {{primarily}} a sedentary bird, feeding {{on the forest floor}} and flying only for short distances. It only perches in trees in order <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> or mate. When alarmed, bleeding-hearts run quickly into nearby undergrowth. It is very elusive in its forested habitat, and nothing else is known about its behavior.|$|E
5|$|Tall eucalypts {{that are}} {{emergent}} over other trees in wooded areas are selected for roosting sites. It {{is here that}} the cockatoos rest for the night, and also rest to shelter from {{the heat of the}} day. They often socialise before dusk, engaging in preening, feeding young, and flying acrobatically. Flocks will return <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> earlier in bad weather.|$|E
50|$|The main {{threats to}} {{conservation}} of the yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat are habitat loss, particularly of old growth trees; disturbance <b>to</b> <b>roosting</b> sites; and prey depletion or secondary poisoning {{as a result}} of pesticides and herbicides.|$|R
25|$|Mobbing {{is thought}} to carry risks <b>to</b> <b>roosting</b> predators, {{including}} potential harm from the mobbing birds, or attracting larger, more dangerous predators. Birds at risk of mobbing such as owls have cryptic plumage and hidden roosts which reduces this danger.|$|R
50|$|In Auburn, New York, 25,000 to 50,000 American crows (C. brachyrhynchos) {{have taken}} <b>to</b> <b>roosting</b> {{in the small}} city's large trees during winter since around 1993. In 2003, a controversial, {{organized}} crow hunt proved ineffective at reducing their numbers and the problem (concerns for {{public health and the}} sheer noise of so many crows) continues.|$|R
5|$|The American robin {{is active}} mostly during the day, {{and on its}} winter grounds it assembles in large flocks at night <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> in trees in secluded swamps or dense vegetation. The flocks break up during {{the day when the}} birds feed on fruits and berries in smaller groups. During the summer, the American robin defends a {{breeding}} territory and is less social.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow is social, {{lives in}} flocks, and usually breeds in colonies. Away from settled areas it {{spends much of}} the year {{wandering}} nomadically, in flocks of up to 200 birds. In cultivated and built up areas, smaller flocks form where food is provided for livestock or birds. In such places, it associates with other seed-eating birds, such as the house sparrow, the Cape weaver, and weavers of the genus Euplectes. Birds from urban areas form large flocks seasonally and fly out to the nearby countryside to feed on ripening grain, returning at night <b>to</b> <b>roost.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sind sparrow is gregarious, {{generally}} forming {{small groups}} of four to six birds while feeding. It tends to breed in loose colonies of a few pairs, and non-breeding birds may gather <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> in acacias or tamarisks near water. During winter, the non-breeding season, it forms larger flocks {{of as many as}} 30 birds, and joins flocks with other seed-eating birds, such as house sparrows and red avadavats. The Sind sparrow feeds mainly on the seeds of grasses and other plants such as Polygonum plebeium. It may also forage for insects such as caterpillars, especially to feed nestlings. Flocks forage on flats alongside rivers, flying into nearby bushes and continuing to forage when disturbed.|$|E
50|$|Inland {{broad-nosed bats}} {{are a common}} species but are {{decreasing}} in population (Pennay & Lumsden 2008). The ‘wide distribution, large population and occurrence {{in a number of}} protected areas’ places this species within the IUCN Red List category of least concern (Pennay & Lumsden 2008). Further research is needed to identify the specific threats to this species (Pennay & Lumsden 2008). Likely threats <b>to</b> <b>roosting</b> sties and feeding grounds include agricultural and forestry activity, clearing for housing, modified fire regimes that eliminate trees with hollows and local removal of access <b>to</b> <b>roosting</b> sites (Parnaby 2008, p. 552). Researchers or wildlife rescuers should be aware that the species are known to be aggressive and their strong jaws deliver a painful bite (Reardon & Flavel 1991, p. 73). Due to their aggressive nature it is also advisable to carry and house them separately to other species (Kemper & Reardon 2014).|$|R

50|$|Horsfield's fruit bats eat {{the fruit}} of {{strangler}} figs, Elaeocarpus, and Payena, and the flowers of bitter beans. They {{have been reported to}} pluck fruit from trees and carry it <b>to</b> <b>roosts</b> elsewhere in order to feed. During the dry season, when fruit is in short supply, they instead feed on pollen, which they take {{from a wide variety of}} different plants.|$|R
5|$|The eggs hatch after 53 to 60days of {{incubation}} by both parents. Chicks {{are born}} with their eyes open and sometimes {{can take up to}} a week to leave the shell completely. The young are covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after five to six months, but continue <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> and forage with their parents until they are in their second year, at which point the parents typically turn their energies to a new nest. Ravens are the main predatory threat to condor eggs, while golden eagles and bears are potential predators of condor offspring.|$|E
5|$|The {{young are}} covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after six months, but {{continue}} <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> and hunt with their parents until age two, when they are displaced by a new clutch. Healthy adults have no natural predators, but large birds of prey and mammalian predators, like foxes, may take eggs or hatchlings. Predation is relatively uncommon, since the vigilant parents often aggressively displace birds of prey who come near and the rocky, precipitous location of most nests are difficult for mammals to access.|$|E
5|$|Having {{the largest}} wing-area-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, {{frigatebirds}} are essentially aerial. This {{allows them to}} soar continuously and only rarely flap their wings. One great frigatebird, being tracked by satellite in the Indian Ocean, stayed aloft for two months. They can fly higher than 4,000 meters in freezing conditions. Like swifts {{they are able to}} spend the night on the wing, but they will also return to an island <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> on trees or cliffs. Field observations in the Mozambique Channel found that great frigatebirds could remain on the wing for up to 12 days while foraging. Highly adept, they use their forked tails for steering during flight and make strong deep wing-beats, though not suited to flying by sustained flapping. Frigatebirds bathe and clean themselves in flight by flying low and splashing at the water surface before preening and scratching afterwards. Conversely, frigatebirds do not swim and with their short legs cannot walk well or take off from the sea easily.|$|E
40|$|Social {{calls in}} bats have many functions, {{including}} mate attraction and maintaining contact during flight. Research suggests that social calls {{may also be}} used to transfer information about roosts, but no studies have yet demonstrated that calls are used to actively attract conspecifics <b>to</b> <b>roosting</b> locations. We document the social calls used by Spix's disc-winged bat (Thyroptera tricolor) to actively recruit group members <b>to</b> <b>roosts.</b> In acoustic trials, we recorded two sets of calls; one from flying individuals termed ‘inquiry calls’, and another from roosting bats termed ‘response calls’. Inquiry calls were emitted by flying bats immediately upon release, and quickly (i. e. 178 ms) elicited production of response calls from roosting individuals. Most flying bats entered the roost when roosting individuals responded, while few bats entered the roost {{in the absence of a}} response. We argue that information transfer concerning roost location may facilitate sociality in T. tricolor, given the ephemeral nature of roosting structures used by this species...|$|R
5000|$|Species {{abundance}} {{of the bat}} in its native Neotropical land may be limited by the availability of roosting sites. Whereas other species of bats are capable of aggregating in large numbers, hanging head-down by their toes from cave ceilings and hollow trees, T. tricolor is adapted <b>to</b> <b>roosting</b> in, and therefore limited by the abundance, or lack thereof, of furled leaves in its habitat ...|$|R
60|$|The keepers tell me {{they get}} even with these kill-birds later in the year, when they take <b>to</b> <b>roosting</b> in the woods, a mile away in the valley. The birds are waited for at some point where they are {{accustomed}} to slip in at dark, and one keeper told me that on one evening alone assisted by a friend he had succeeded in shooting thirty birds.|$|R
5|$|The condor soars {{with its}} wings held {{horizontally}} and its primary feathers bent upwards at the tips. The {{lack of a}} large sternum to anchor its correspondingly large flight muscles physiologically identifies it as primarily being a soarer. It flaps its wings on rising from the ground, but after attaining a moderate elevation it flaps its wings very rarely, relying on thermals to stay aloft. Charles Darwin commented on having watched them {{for half an hour}} without once observing a flap of their wings. It prefers <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> on high places from which it can launch without major wing-flapping effort. Andean condors are often seen soaring near rock cliffs, using the heat thermals to aid them in rising in the air.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} not yet been well defined in their areas of roosting. Some have even been found <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> in caves and {{possibly}} housing, though whether this is typical behavior or an effect of displacement is uncertain. Tracking the species by radio signals, {{it was found that the}} species prefers older, larger trees, specifically beeches, perhaps due to possessing relatively spacious trunks and branches, allowing for ease of entry. The species does not have one specific roost, but a network through which the colony can rotate individuals. Recent years have seen less reliance on fossil fuels and rather relying on wood as a source of energy, and consequently an increase in logging, therefore it is important to locate the areas in which they roosts to identify those which should be protected to prevent their decline, through which radio tracking proves an effective method.|$|E
5|$|This martin {{builds a}} deep bowl nest on a {{sheltered}} horizontal surface, or a neat quarter-sphere against a vertical rock face or wall. The nest is constructed with mud pellets and lined with grass or feathers, {{and may be}} built on natural sites under cliff overhangs or on man-made structures such as buildings and bridges. It is often reused for subsequent broods or in later years. This species is often a solitary breeder, but small groups may breed close together in suitable locations. The two or three eggs of a typical clutch are white with brown and grey blotches, and are incubated by both adults for 16–19 days prior to hatching. Both parents then feed the chicks. Fledging takes another 22–24 days, although the young birds {{will return to the}} nest <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> for {{a few days after the}} first flight.|$|E

50|$|Fruit eating, or frugivory, {{is found}} in {{particular}} species from both major suborders. These bats favor fleshy and sweet fruits, but not those particularly strong smelling or colorful. They pull the fruit off the trees with their teeth, then fly back <b>to</b> their <b>roosts</b> <b>to</b> consume them, sucking out the juice and spitting the seeds and pulp out onto the ground.|$|R
40|$|Among shorebirds, many {{individuals}} make migratory and short-distance movements in large flocks, suggesting that stable social groups may persist within populations for days to months. We examined high-tide associations among individual radio-marked Dunlin wintering at Humboldt Bay, California, {{to determine if}} flocks represented stable social groups. The rate of co-occurrence of two individuals in the same flock was generally low (15 % of surveys), and 86 % of pairs co-occurred no more than expected by chance. Associations were ephemeral, lasting 1. 1 consecutive high tides on average. Variation in co-occurrence reflected individual fidelity <b>to</b> <b>roosts,</b> as well as population-wide differences in space use with precipitation and time of day. Dunlin flock composition was fluid, and individuals appeared to associate by chance according to shared attraction <b>to</b> common <b>roosts.</b> Our {{findings are consistent with}} predictions for a highly mobile, generally nonterritorial, long-distance migrant for which stable social associations have no clear benefit...|$|R
5|$|Triaenops menamena mainly {{occurs in}} the dry regions of western Madagascar, but has also been {{recorded}} in humid areas in the far southeast and northeast, and is found up to 1300m (4300ft) above sea level. It mainly occurs in forests, but has also been recorded outside forest and is not dependent on it. An obligate cave dweller, it is known <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> in large colonies, with one cave colony estimated to contain over 40,000 bats; this cave also contained an estimated 10,000 Paratriaenops furculus. The effective population size of the species {{is estimated to be}} about 121,000. Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) form the main component of its diet, but it also eats Coleoptera (beetles) and Hemiptera (bugs) and fewer members of some other insect orders. It is unclear how the ecological niches of Triaenops and the less frequently captured Paratriaenops furculus are separated, as both eat lepidopterans and occur in the same regions.|$|E
5|$|Turquoise parrots are {{encountered}} in pairs or small groups consisting {{of parents and}} several offspring, though they may congregate into larger flocks of up to 75 predominantly juvenile birds outside the breeding season. As the breeding season nears, pairs separate out from these flocks. Turquoise parrots roost together communally in autumn and winter. At night they roost among the foliage of trees such as gums or wattles, anywhere from 1 to 8m (3–25ft) above the ground. They retreat to trees near their feeding areas during the day. The calls of the turquoise parrot have been little-studied; birds give a high-pitched soft contact call when feeding or in flight, while the alarm call {{has been described as}} a high-pitched zitting call. Turquoise parrots also chatter when settling <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> in the evening.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{cautious}} {{when approaching}} the colony and no bird likes {{to land in}} a location where other puffins are not already present. They make several circuits of the colony before alighting. On the ground they spend much time preening, spreading oil from their preen gland and setting each feather in its correct position with beak or claw. They also spend time standing by their burrow entrances and interacting with passing birds. Dominance is shown by an upright stance, with fluffed chest feathers and cocked tail, an exaggerated slow walk, head jerking and gaping. Submissive birds lower their head and hold their body horizontal and scurry past dominant individuals. Birds normally signal their intention to take off by briefly lowering their body before running down the slope to gain momentum. If a bird is startled and takes off unexpectedly, a panic can spread through the colony with all the birds launching themselves {{into the air and}} wheeling around in a great circle. The colony is at its most active in the evening, with birds standing outside their burrows, resting on the turf or strolling around. Then the slopes empty for the night as the birds fly out to sea <b>to</b> <b>roost,</b> often choosing to do so at fishing grounds ready for early morning provisioning.|$|E

5|$|The {{range of}} this species {{includes}} Northern Arkansas and southern Missouri, East to the Appalachian Mountains and Ohio River Basin, North into New England, southern Ontario and Quebec. Distribution of the bats is spotty within their entire range, and they {{are considered to be}} very uncommon. These bats prefer to reside in deciduous or coniferous forests. They are active in mountain ranges from 240–1125 meters in height. During the spring, summer, and autumn they prefer <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> at emergent rock-outcrops such as cliffs, bluffs, shale barrens, and talus slopes, as well as man-made structures, including buildings, joints between segments of cement guard rails, turnpike tunnels, road-cuts, and scree covered dams. The largest populations of Myotis leibii have been found in New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Western Virginia. (red list) The total count of individuals in all hibernacula in which they have been found is 3,000, with roughly 60% of the total number from just two sites in New York. Unfortunately, 90% of their habitat is on private land which makes it difficult to protect them.|$|E
5|$|The Australian raven can {{be found}} in a wide range of natural and {{modified}} habitats. It requires available water and trees (or buildings) <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> in or perch on. Preferred habitats include eucalypt-dominated sclerophyll forest, and farmland adjacent to trees. It is also found in heath and mangroves. In areas where it occurs with the little raven, namely over much of central New South Wales, Victoria and into South Australia, the Australian raven is restricted to more forested areas while the latter species prefers more open areas. Similarly, in inland Australia it can share range with the little crow, as the two do not appear to compete. However, the ranges of similar-sized forest raven and Torresian crow only narrowly overlap with the Australian raven as all three compete with each other. In central and western regions, Australian ravens and Torresian crows vie for the scattered uncommon trees and outcrops, and only one or the other are found there. It co-occurs with the forest raven in northeastern New South Wales from Port Stephens northwards. The Australian raven has adapted very well to human habitation in some cities and is the most common corvid in Canberra, Sydney and Perth; in Melbourne and Adelaide it is replaced by the little raven, and by the Torresian crow in Brisbane. Its large range, abundance and increasing population mean it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
