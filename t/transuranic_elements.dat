5|$|Like all {{synthetic}} <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements,</b> isotopes of einsteinium {{are very}} radioactive and are considered highly dangerous to health on ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Noddack was proven {{right after}} all. Fermi had {{dismissed}} {{the possibility of}} fission {{on the basis of}} his calculations, but he had not taken into account the binding energy that would appear when a nuclide with an odd number of neutrons absorbed an extra neutron. For Fermi, the news came as a profound embarrassment, as the <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> that he had partly been awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering had not been <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> at all, but fission products. He added a footnote to this effect to his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.|$|E
5|$|The <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> from {{americium}} to fermium, including berkelium, occurred {{naturally in}} the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium is a {{synthetic}} element with symbol Es and atomic number 99. It is the seventh <b>transuranic</b> <b>element,</b> and an actinide.|$|R
5|$|Mendelevium is a {{synthetic}} element with chemical symbol Md (formerly Mv) and atomic number 101. A metallic radioactive <b>transuranic</b> <b>element</b> in the actinide series, {{it is the}} first element that currently cannot be produced in macroscopic quantities through neutron bombardment of lighter elements. It is the third-to-last actinide and the ninth <b>transuranic</b> <b>element.</b> It can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. A total of sixteen mendelevium isotopes are known, the most stable being 258Md with a half-life of 51days; nevertheless, the shorter-lived 256Md (half-life 1.17hours) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.|$|R
50|$|After him {{was also}} named mendelevium, {{which is a}} {{synthetic}} chemical element with the symbol Md (formerly Mv) and the atomic number 101. It is a metallic radioactive <b>transuranic</b> <b>element</b> in the actinide series, usually synthesized by bombarding einsteinium with alpha particles.|$|R
5|$|There {{is almost}} {{no use for}} any isotope of {{einsteinium}} outside basic scientific research aiming at production of higher <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> and transactinides.|$|E
5|$|It {{was only}} with the {{discovery}} of the first <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements,</b> which from plutonium onward have dominant +3 and +4 oxidation states like the lanthanides, that it was realised that the actinides were indeed filling f-orbitals rather than d-orbitals, with the transition-metal-like chemistry of the early actinides being the exception and not the rule. In 1945, when American physicist Glenn T. Seaborg and his team had discovered the <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> americium and curium, he realised that thorium was the second member of the actinide series and was filling an f-block row, instead of being the heavier congener of hafnium filling a fourth d-block row.|$|E
5|$|Although minute {{quantities}} of some <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> occur naturally, {{they were all}} first discovered in laboratories. Their production has expanded the periodic table significantly, {{the first of these}} being neptunium, synthesized in 1939. Because many of the <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> are highly unstable and decay quickly, they are challenging to detect and characterize when produced. There have been controversies concerning the acceptance of competing discovery claims for some elements, requiring independent review to determine which party has priority, and hence naming rights. In 2010, a joint Russia–US collaboration at Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, claimed to have synthesized six atoms of tennessine (element 117), making it the most recently claimed discovery. It, along with nihonium (element 113), moscovium (element 115), and oganesson (element 118), are the four most recently named elements, whose names all became official on 28 November 2016.|$|E
25|$|Einsteinium is a {{metallic}} synthetic element. On the periodic table, it {{is represented by}} the symbol Es and atomic number 99. It is the seventh <b>transuranic</b> <b>element,</b> and an actinide. It was named in honor of Albert Einstein. Einsteinium was discovered by Albert Ghioirso in December 1952.|$|R
50|$|The menace in {{this story}} {{consists}} of dust from {{the tail of a}} comet. It consists of a colloid, analogous to smoke, that incorporates an unknown <b>transuranic</b> <b>element.</b> That element has a great affinity for metal surfaces and it weakens their surface tension, thereby enabling rapidly moving parts to cold weld themselves into solid rigidity.|$|R
5000|$|The {{time machine}} uses Element-115 {{salvaged}} from the Roswell crash. This <b>transuranic</b> <b>element</b> {{allowed them to}} generate a time distortion field around the Chronosphere. The sphere is teleported away from the hangar and into space, after which the chrononaut, Frank Parker, steers the sphere towards the required space and time coordinates (referred to as [...] "flying the needles").|$|R
5|$|There is {{currently}} {{no use for}} any isotope of berkelium outside basic scientific research. Berkelium-249 is a common target nuclide to prepare still heavier <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> and transactinides, such as lawrencium, rutherfordium and bohrium. It is also useful {{as a source of}} the isotope californium-249, which is used for studies on the chemistry of californium in preference to the more radioactive californium-252 that is produced in neutron bombardment facilities such as the HFIR.|$|E
5|$|Americium is {{produced}} mostly artificially in small quantities, for research purposes. A tonne of {{spent nuclear fuel}} contains about 100grams of various americium isotopes, mostly 241Am and 243Am. Their prolonged radioactivity is undesirable for the disposal, and therefore americium, together with other long-lived actinides, must be neutralized. The associated procedure may involve several steps, where americium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure is well known as nuclear transmutation, {{but it is still}} being developed for americium. The <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> from americium to fermium occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of einsteinium, any primordial einsteinium, that is einsteinium that could possibly be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of einsteinium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, all terrestrial einsteinium is produced in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few years}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis. The <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> from americium to fermium, including einsteinium, occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so. Einsteinium was observed in Przybylski's Star in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Curium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with the symbol Cm and atomic number 96. A radioactive metallic <b>transuranic</b> <b>element</b> of the actinide series, curium {{is produced by}} bombarding plutonium with alpha particles (helium ions) and was named after Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie. Curium was co-discovered by Glenn T. Seaborg, Ralph A. James, and Albert Ghiorso at the University of California at Berkeley in 1944.|$|R
25|$|Mendelevium is a {{synthetic}} element with the symbol Md (formerly Mv) and the atomic number 101. A metallic radioactive <b>transuranic</b> <b>element</b> of the actinides, mendelevium is usually synthesized by bombarding einsteinium with alpha particles {{and was named}} after the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev, {{who was responsible for}} the Periodic Table. Mendelevium was co-discovered by Albert Ghiorso, Bernard G. Harvey, Gregory R. Choppin, Stanley G. Thompson, and Glenn T. Seaborg in 1955.|$|R
50|$|Nishina co-authored the Klein-Nishina formula. His {{research}} {{was concerned with}} cosmic rays and particle accelerator development for which he constructed a few cyclotrons at RIKEN. In particular, he detected {{what turned out to}} be the muon in cosmic rays, independently of Anderson et al. He also discovered the uranium-237 isotope and pioneered the studies of symmetric fission phenomena occurring upon fast neutron irradiation of uranium (1939-1940), and narrowly missed out on the discovery of the first <b>transuranic</b> <b>element,</b> neptunium.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of fermium, any primordial fermium, that is fermium that could be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of fermium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, most fermium is produced on Earth in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few months}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis. The <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> from americium to fermium did occur naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E
5|$|Just {{over one}} gram of {{berkelium}} has been {{produced in the}} United States since 1967. There is no practical application of berkelium outside scientific research which is mostly directed at the synthesis of heavier <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> and transactinides. A 22milligram batch of berkelium-249 was prepared during a 250-day irradiation period and then purified for a further 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This sample was used to synthesize the new element tennessine {{for the first time}} in 2009 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Russia, after it was bombarded with calcium-48 ions for 150 days. This was the culmination of the Russia–US collaboration on the synthesis of the heaviest elements on the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Joe Mayer {{was fired}} in 1937. He {{attributed}} this to the hatred of women {{on the part of}} the dean of physical sciences, which he thought was provoked by Goeppert Mayer's presence in the laboratory. Herzfeld agreed and added that, with Goeppert Mayer, Franck and Herzfeld all at Johns Hopkins, some thought that there were too many German scientists there. There were also complaints from some students that Mayer's chemistry lectures contained too much modern physics. Mayer took up a position at Columbia University, where the chairman of the Physics Department, George B. Pegram, arranged for Goeppert Mayer to have an office, but she received no salary. She soon made good friends with Harold Urey and Enrico Fermi, who arrived at Columbia in 1939. Fermi asked her to investigate the valence shell of the undiscovered <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements.</b> Using the Thomas–Fermi model, she predicted that they would form a new series similar to the rare earth elements. This proved to be correct.|$|E
50|$|At Ceres Ellen reveals {{herself to}} be an agent for Hansen {{investigating}} the mining work, which is plagued with irregularities. In particular, a new element called Arthurium is being mined on Ceres. This is a stable <b>transuranic</b> <b>element</b> of the kind predicted during the 1970s based on the theory of an Island of stability for elements of atomic number 114, 120 and 126. Being super-heavy, these elements sink into the cores of planets and are not accessible, but {{may be found in}} asteroids.|$|R
5|$|In 1871, Dmitri Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} an element between thorium and uranium. The actinide element group was unknown at the time. Therefore, uranium was positioned below tungsten in group VI, and thorium below zirconium in group IV, leaving the space below tantalum in group V empty and, until the 1950s, periodic tables were published with this structure. For a long time chemists searched for eka-tantalum as an element with similar chemical properties to tantalum, making a discovery of protactinium nearly impossible. Tantalum's heavier analogue was later found to be the <b>transuranic</b> <b>element</b> dubnium.|$|R
25|$|Californium is a {{radioactive}} metallic {{chemical element}} with the symbol Cf and atomic number 98. The element was first produced by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium ions) at the University of California, Berkeley. It was the sixth <b>transuranic</b> <b>element</b> to be synthesized. Californium {{is one of}} the highest atomic mass elements to have been produced in weighable amounts. It is named for the U.S. state of California and the University of California. Californium was co-discovered by Stanley G. Thompson, Albert Ghiorso, and Glenn T. Seaborg in 1950.|$|R
5|$|All {{isotopes}} between 242Cm and 248Cm, {{as well as}} 250Cm, {{undergo a}} self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction and thus in principle {{can act as a}} nuclear fuel in a reactor. As in most <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements,</b> the nuclear fission cross section is especially high for the odd-mass curium isotopes 243Cm, 245Cm and 247Cm. These can be used in thermal-neutron reactors, whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for fast breeder reactors since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burn-up increases. The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, which is to be used in power reactors, should contain little or no curium because the neutron activation of 248Cm will create californium. This is strong neutron emitter, and would pollute the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to reactor personnel. Hence, if the minor actinides are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor, the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present.|$|E
5|$|Mendelevium was {{the ninth}} {{transuranic}} element to be synthesized. It was first synthesized by Albert Ghiorso, Glenn T. Seaborg, Gregory Robert Choppin, Bernard G. Harvey, and team leader Stanley G. Thompson in early 1955 at the University of California, Berkeley. The team produced 256Md (half-life of 77 minutes) when they bombarded an 253Es target consisting {{of only a}} billion (109) einsteinium atoms with alpha particles (helium nuclei) in the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory's 60-inch cyclotron, thus increasing the target's atomic number by two. 256Md thus became the first isotope of any element to be synthesized one atom at a time. In total, seventeen mendelevium atoms were produced. This discovery {{was part of a}} program, begun in 1952, that irradiated plutonium with neutrons to transmute it into heavier actinides. This method was necessary as the previous method used to synthesize <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements,</b> neutron capture, could not work {{because of a lack of}} known beta decaying isotopes of fermium that would produce isotopes of the next element, mendelevium, and also due to the very short half-life to spontaneous fission of 258Fm that thus constituted a hard limit to the success of the neutron capture process.|$|E
5|$|A synthetic, {{radioactive}} element, curium is a hard, dense metal with a silvery-white {{appearance and}} {{physical and chemical}} properties resembling those of gadolinium. Its melting point of 1340°C is significantly higher than that of the previous <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> neptunium (637°C), plutonium (639°C) and americium (1173°C). In comparison, gadolinium melts at 1312°C. The boiling point of curium is 3110°C. With a density of 13.52 g/cm3, curium is significantly lighter than neptunium (20.45 g/cm3) and plutonium (19.8 g/cm3), but is heavier than most other metals. Between two crystalline forms of curium, the α-Cm is more stable at ambient conditions. It has a hexagonal symmetry, space group P63/mmc, lattice parameters a = 365 pm and c = 1182 pm, and four formula units per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum. At pressures above 23 GPa, at room temperature, α-Cm transforms into β-Cm, which has a face-centered cubic symmetry, space group Fmm and the lattice constant a = 493 pm. Upon further compression to 43 GPa, curium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-Cm structure similar to that of α-uranium, with no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa. These three curium phases are also referred to as Cm I, II and III.|$|E

5000|$|Most of {{the three}} {{thousand}} tonnes {{of each of the}} [...] "super" [...] Orion's propulsion units would be inert material such as polyethylene, or boron salts, used to transmit the force of the propulsion units detonation to the Orion's pusher plate, and absorb neutrons to minimize fallout. One design proposed by Freeman Dyson for the [...] "Super Orion" [...] called for the pusher plate to be composed primarily of uranium or a <b>transuranic</b> <b>element</b> so that upon reaching a nearby star system the plate could be converted to nuclear fuel.|$|R
25|$|The same year, his {{doctoral}} student James Chadwick discovered the neutron, which was immediately {{recognized as a}} potential tool for nuclear experimentation because of its lack of an electric charge. Experimentation with bombardment of materials with neutrons led Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie to discover induced radioactivity in 1934, which allowed the creation of radium-like elements at much less the price of natural radium. Further work by Enrico Fermi in the 1930s focused on using slow neutrons to increase the effectiveness of induced radioactivity. Experiments bombarding uranium with neutrons led Fermi to believe he had created a new, <b>transuranic</b> <b>element,</b> which was dubbed hesperium.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the many}} {{different}} and unknown radioactive half-lives in the experiment's results showed that several nuclear reactions were occurring, Fermi's group could not prove that element 93 was being created unless they could isolate it chemically. They and many other scientists attempted to accomplish this, including Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner who were among the best radiochemists {{in the world at}} the time and supporters of Fermi's claim, but they all failed. Much later, it was determined that the main reason for this failure was because the predictions of element 93's chemical properties were based on a periodic table which lacked the actinide series. This arrangement placed protactinium below tantalum, uranium below tungsten, and further suggested that element 93, at that point referred to as eka-rhenium, should be similar to the group 7 elements, including manganese and rhenium. Thorium, protactinium, and uranium, with their dominant oxidation states of +4, +5, and +6 respectively, fooled scientists into thinking they belonged below hafnium, tantalum, and tungsten, rather than below the lanthanide series, which was at the time viewed as a fluke, and whose members all have dominant +3 states; neptunium, on the other hand, has a much weaker, more unstable +7 state, with +4 and +5 being the most stable. Upon finding that plutonium and the other <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> also have dominant +3 and +4 states, along with the discovery of the f-block, the actinide series was firmly established.|$|E
5|$|Each fusion {{event in}} the D-T fusion reactor gives off an alpha {{particle}} and a fast neutron with around 14MeV of kinetic energy. This is enough energy to cause fission in U-238, and many other <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> as well. This reaction is used in H-bombs to increase the yield of the fusion section by wrapping it in a layer of depleted uranium, which undergoes rapid fission when hit by the neutrons from the fusion bomb inside. The same basic concept {{can also be used}} with a fusion reactor like LIFE, using its neutrons to cause fission in a blanket of fission fuel. Unlike a fission reactor, which burns out its fuel once the U-235 drops below a certain threshold value, these fission–fusion hybrid reactors can continue producing power from the fission fuel as long as the fusion reactor continues to provide neutrons. As the neutrons have high energy, they can potentially cause multiple fission events, leading to the reactor as a whole producing more energy, a concept known as energy multiplication. Even leftover nuclear fuel taken from conventional nuclear reactors will burn in this fashion. This is potentially attractive because this burns off many of the long lived radioisotopes in the process, producing waste that is only mildly radioactive and lacking most long-lived components.|$|E
