Club gave this episode a [...] "B" [...] rating and commented that [...] "The Simpsons episodes that strive {{to have a little}} heart without going overboard are generally going to work better than the random-gag episodes, at least {{at this point in the}} storied history of The Simpsons, and 'Bart Stops <b>To</b> <b>Smell</b> <b>The</b> Roosevelts' has enough wee little heart to see this episode through", but further wrote that [...] "there were a number of jokes that didn't work, Milhouse's final scene in particular, but the episode had a steady stream of gags to push through the lean times. And that's all we can ask for." [...] Ology's Josh Harrison was also positive and gave the episode a rating of seven out of ten, while commenting that he [...] "thought this was a definite downgrade from the season premiere in terms of sheer comedic value, but the sincerity of Bart's educational experience, combined with the enthusiasm of his mad quest for justice, definitely made this one a winner." ...|$|E

500|$|During preproduction, Webber and cinematographer Eduardo Serra {{studied the}} period's artwork and {{discussed}} the different moods {{they wanted to}} create for each scene. The director was a lover of the Stanley Kubrick period drama Barry Lyndon, but knew that Girl With a Pearl Earring would be different; unlike the former film's [...] "... elaborate and expensive set pieces ...," [...] Webber's production was to be [...] "... about the intimate relationships within a single household." [...] He was not seeking to create a historically accurate biographical film of Vermeer; Webber sought to direct a period film that avoided being [...] "overly slavish" [...] to characteristics of the genre, desiring instead to [...] "... bring the film to life ..." [...] and have viewers [...] "... be able almost <b>to</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> meat in the market." [...] Webber employed little dialogue and drew inspiration from the [...] "... quiet, tense, mysterious, transcendent world ..." [...] of Vermeer's paintings. The director also made {{a conscious effort to}} slow the pace of the film, hoping that by [...] "... slowing things down [...] create these moments in between the dialogue that were full of emotion. And the more silent the film became, the closer it seemed to be to the condition of those Vermeer paintings and the closer it seemed to capture some kind of truth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reading {{the words}} [...] "and it bred worms and rotted" [...] in [...] a Midrash asked whether {{anything}} exists that first produces worms and then rots (implying that surely, rot precedes worms). Answering in the negative, the Midrash taught that God wished to reveal to people the deeds {{of those who}} disobeyed and saved the manna, so God caused many worms to breed during that night so that the sinners should not be able <b>to</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> staleness of the manna {{in the evening and}} throw it out. The Midrash told that Moses became so angry with them that he forgot to tell them to gather two omers for each person on the sixth day. So when they went out and gathered on the sixth day and found a double portion, the princes told Moses, as [...] reports, [...] "And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses." [...] The Midrash noted that Moses told them (in [...] ), [...] "This is that which the Lord has spoken," [...] not [...] "which I have spoken," [...] because Moses had forgotten. For this reason, the Midrash taught, in [...] God asked, [...] "How long will you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws?"
