5|$|The British monarch is Sovereign of the Order of St Patrick. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the monarch's {{representative}} in Ireland, {{served as the}} Grand Master. The office of Lord Lieutenant was abolished in 1922; the last Lord Lieutenant and Grand Master was The 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent. Rather oddly, the statutes of the Order did not provide that the Grand Master be admitted to the Order {{as a matter of}} right. While some Lords Lieutenant were in fact appointed to the Order, this seems to have been the exception rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|E
5|$|Trillium grandiflorum {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular trilliums in cultivation, {{primarily}} because of the size of its flowers and its relative ease of cultivation. Although not particularly demanding, its cultivation is a slow and rather uncertain process, due to usually slow growth, wide variations in growth speed and sometimes capricious germination rates. As a result, the vast majority of plants and rhizomes in commerce are collected in the wild, and such heavy collecting, combined with other pressures such as habitat destruction and grazing, may effectively endanger the plants in some areas. This also creates tensions between Trillium enthusiasts and conservation proponents. Transplantation (as with almost all non-weedy wild plants) is a delicate process, and in many cases results in the death of the plant. In cultivation, T. grandiflorum may flower in as little as 4 to 5 years after germination (compared to the usual 7 to 10 in the wild), but these cases appear to be exceptions rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> One study revealed 20 or so individuals performing so well out of about 10,000 seeds planted, only 20% of which germinated after a year. However, barring plant destruction, T. grandiflorum can continue flowering every year after it has begun.|$|E

25|$|After the Great Schism, {{there existed}} a Catholic Bishopric of Cumania (later, {{separate}} bishoprics in both Wallachia and Moldavia). However, {{this seems to}} be the exception, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> as in both Wallachia and Moldavia the state religion was Eastern Orthodox. Until the 17th century, the official language of the liturgy was Old Church Slavonic. Then, it gradually changed to Romanian.|$|E

25|$|Her work {{makes clear}} that for medieval readers the act of reading itself had an oral phase in which the text was read aloud or sub-vocalized (silent reading was a less common variant, and {{appears to have been}} the {{exception}} rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule),</b> then meditated upon and 'digested' hence making it one's own.

According to Aguirre, decisions to pursue small cases and ignore the much larger ones involving the financial elite are less the exception, <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> and explain why Bernie Madoff was ignored for so long.|$|E
25|$|Gradually, {{the members}} of the National Language Commission came to settle upon the Beijing dialect, which became the major source of {{standard}} national pronunciation due to its prestigious status. In 1932, the commission published the Vocabulary of National Pronunciation for Everyday Use (国音常用字汇/國音常用字彙), with little fanfare or official announcement. This dictionary was similar to the previous published one except that it normalized the pronunciations for all characters into the pronunciation of the Beijing dialect. Elements from other dialects continue to exist in the standard language, but as exceptions rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|E

25|$|In the {{passenger}} airline case, capacity {{is regarded as}} fixed because changing what aircraft flies a certain service based on the demand is the exception rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> When the aircraft departs, the unsold seats cannot generate any revenue and thus {{can be said to}} have perished, or have spoiled. Airlines use specialized software to monitor how seats are reserved and react accordingly. There are various inventory controls such as a nested inventory system. For example, airlines can offer discounts on low-demand flights, where the flight will likely not sell out. When there is excess demand, the seats can be sold at a higher price.|$|E
25|$|All {{three of}} the {{northern}} New England states (Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine) contain some areas that are unincorporated and unorganized, not part of any town, city or plantation. Maine has significantly more such area {{than the other two}} states. While these areas do exist, their importance should not be overstated. They are certainly the exception rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> in the New England system, and the number of New England residents who live in them is extremely small in comparison to those who live in towns and cities, even in Maine. Most such areas are located in very sparsely populated regions. Much of the barely inhabited interior of Maine is unorganized, for example.|$|E
25|$|This can be {{the case}} when {{multiple}} genes act in parallel {{to achieve the same}} effect. For example, when an organism is in need of phosphorus, multiple enzymes that break down different phosphorylated components from the environment may act additively {{to increase the amount of}} phosphorus available to the organism. However, there inevitably comes a point where phosphorus is no longer the limiting factor for growth and reproduction and so further improvements in phosphorus metabolism have smaller or no effect (negative epistasis). Some sets of mutations within genes have also been specifically found to be additive. It is now considered that strict additivity is the exception, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> since most genes interact with hundreds or thousands of other genes.|$|E

25|$|Preparing for {{sea-level rise}} can be {{justified}} in many cases, because the cost of preparing now is small compared {{to the cost of}} reacting later. Examples include wetland protection, flood insurance, long-lived infrastructure, and coastal land-use planning. Nevertheless, preparing for sea-level rise has been the exception rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> Most coastal institutions were based on the implicit assumption that sea level and shorelines are stable. Efforts to plan for sea-level rise can be thwarted by several institutional biases, including government policies that encourage coastal development, flood insurance maps that do not consider sea-level rise, federal policies that prefer shoreline armoring over soft shore protection, and lack of plans delineating which areas would be protected or not as sea level rises.|$|E
25|$|The royal council or witan {{played a}} central but limited role in the Anglo-Saxon period. The main feature of the system was its high degree of decentralisation. The {{interference}} by the king through his granting of charters and the activity of his witan in litigation are exceptions rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> in Anglo-Saxon times. The most important court in the later Anglo-Saxon period was the Shire Court. It is of interest that many shires (such as Kent and Sussex) were {{in the early days}} of the Anglo-Saxon settlement the centre of small independent kingdoms. As the kings first of Mercia and then of Wessex slowly extended their authority over the whole of England they left the Shire Courts with overall responsibility for the administration of law. The Shire met in one or more traditional places, earlier in the open air and then later in a Moot or meeting hall. The meeting of the Shire Court was presided over by an officer, the shire reeve or sheriff, whose appointment came in later Anglo-Saxon times into the hands of the king but had in earlier times been elective. The sheriff was not the judge of the court, merely its president. The judges of the court were all those who had the right and duty of attending the court, the suitors. These were originally all free male inhabitants of the neighbourhood but, over time, suit of court became an obligation attached to particular holdings of land. The sessions of a Shire Court resembled more closely those of a modern local administrative body than a modern court. It could and did act judicially but this was not its prime function. In the Shire Court, charters and writs would be read out for all to hear.|$|E
500|$|For {{the chamber}} repertoire, Ketèlbey {{composed}} a string quartet (c.1896) and a quintet for piano and wind (1896) {{which won the}} Costa Prize and the College Gold Medal. His 1894 Romance for violin and piano was praised as [...] "a charming, musicianly work". His other early works include choral pieces, including the anthems [...] "Every good Gift"; [...] "Behold upon the mountains", and [...] "Be strong, all ye people" [...] (all 1896). After these works he moved professionally into conducting light opera, and serious music became the exception rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> in his compositions.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{principal}} results in the economic theory of litigation is that <b>the</b> English <b>rule</b> of fee allocation (in which the loser pays the winner 2 ̆ 7 s litigation costs) is better at discouraging suits by low-probability-of-prevailing plaintiffs <b>than</b> <b>the</b> American <b>rule</b> (in which each side bears its own costs). This result has been demonstrated {{under the assumption that}} all suits that are filed go to trial. Using a standard asymmetric- information model of litigation, we show that when the settlement process is taken into account <b>the</b> English <b>rule</b> results in more low-probability-of-prevailing plaintiffs going to trial <b>than</b> <b>the</b> American <b>rule.</b> In this sense, <b>the</b> English <b>rule</b> encourages low-probability plaintiffs more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> American <b>rule...</b>|$|R

500|$|In Singapore, an {{applicant}} {{must have a}} [...] "sufficient interest" [...] in {{the subject of the}} application to have standing to apply for a prerogative order, that is, a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order. Previously, the rule of standing for mandatory orders was stricter <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> applicable to prohibiting and quashing orders. To apply for a mandatory order, {{an applicant}} had to show a specific legal right in the matter. In contrast, an applicant only had to show that [...] "there had been an abuse of power which inconvenienced someone" [...] to apply for a prohibiting or quashing order. This rule of standing for prohibiting and quashing orders was relatively easy to satisfy because such orders were often used to ensure good standards of public administration.|$|E
500|$|Ships {{designed}} for coastal warfare, like the floating batteries of the Crimea, or [...] and her sisters, dispensed with masts from the beginning. The British , started in 1869, {{was the first}} large, ocean-going ironclad to dispense with masts. Her principal role was for combat in the English Channel and other European waters; while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the Atlantic, {{she would have had}} little endurance {{on the other side of}} the ocean. The Devastation and the similar ships commissioned by the British and Russian navies in the 1870s were the exception rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> Most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts, and only the Italian navy, which during that decade was focused on short-range operations in the Adriatic, built consistently mastless ironclads.|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} made heavy use of guitars since its inception, and pioneered their {{use during the}} band's early days in Germany. Although not a metal fan, Konietzko said his [...] "infatuation with ripping off metal licks" [...] stemmed from his {{experiments}} with E-mu's Emax sampler in late 1986, adding, [...] "What I always hated most about heavy metal was that the best riffs came only once and were never repeated. So the fascination, actually, was to sample a great riff, loop it, and play {{it over and over}} again." [...] While the album Don't Blow Your Top was more sparse in content, due to the influence of producer Sherwood, it was the exception rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> Ministry founder and frontman Al Jourgensen, on tour with the band in 1989, described KMFDM as [...] "a battalion of guitars marching through Europe." ...|$|E
