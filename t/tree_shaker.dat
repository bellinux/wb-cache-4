40|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>shaker</b> {{is a high}} {{throughput}} hydro-mechanical systems used in nut {{and fruit}} harvest. Many commercial tree shakers use stacked counter rotating eccentric mass energy-wheels to dislodge the crop from the tree by attaching and shaking the trunk. Tree shakers are known to cause tree trunk damage by approach impact, barking, and bruising of the tree trunk. Tree trunk damage, catastrophic or accumulative, could account for a 4 % lifetime production loss, 1408 kg/hectare.;The energy-wheels are commonly known to create planer pulse forces. The pulse is created by the rotation of eccentric mass about a fixed common shaft. The frequency and magnitude of the force {{is determined by the}} weight, angular velocity, and center of gravity location of each energy wheel. The industry has developed pads and slings to conform to the tree trunk and transmit the force while minimizing the potential for trunk damage. Lubrication of the slings reduces the coefficient of friction and allows unwanted force dissipation. Lubrication of the slings reduce the transfer of non-normal forces.;This research discloses the presence of moments and extends the planer equations to allow analysis of moment magnitudes and the introduction of planer losses in the y-axis. Moments and planer forces are always present in stacked counter rotating eccentric mass energy-wheel systems. Moments are non-normal forces and are dissipated in the slings, pads, shaker head suspension system. Moments and y-axis losses reduce the efficiency of the system and require additional hardware and systems to control adverse effects on the tree trunk.;Understanding the magnitude of moments will allow development of new systems to extend the application of mechanical shakers to other crops and applications...|$|E

40|$|An {{effective}} management program for stink bugs (SBs) in pecan groves requires knowledge of: {{stages of the}} pecans susceptible to SB damage; strata of the tree with SB damaged nuts; a practical SB monitoring method; and, effects of landscapes contributing SBs into pecan groves. Stink bugs produced feeding punctures in pecan shucks at all phenological stages. Pecans punctured before the dough stage drop from the tree. Kernel damage occurs in the pecans’ dough stage, whereas mature pecans are not damaged. The pecans collected from the whole tree using the <b>tree</b> <b>shaker</b> had significantly less punctures than the pecans collected from lower limbs. Stink bug feeding damage occurred more in the lower pecan canopy than the middle or upper canopy. Pecans collected in late-September near harvest had significantly more SB punctures and damage in the lower strata of the pecan trees than the middle or the upper strata. The SB counts were compared from four SB monitoring methods (baited yellow pyramid traps, UV-light traps, visual surveys and canopy knock-down sprays). The most practical method for pecan growers was the baited yellow pyramid trap. Yellow pyramid traps baited with Euschistus (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) aggregation pheromone were used to monitor movement of SBs from adjacent landscapes to pecan groves. SB trap counts were compared to percentages of SB punctured or damaged pecans. The grove center acted as a refuge for SBs. The forest tree line and soybean landscape contributed more SBs to a pecan grove than other landscapes. The number of SBs or percentages of SB punctured nuts did not equate to percentages of SB damaged nuts. SB damaged nuts remained relatively low until the water stage. I suggested using baited yellow pyramid traps for making SB pest management decisions during susceptible water through dough pecan nut stages...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade {{considerable}} progress was achieved {{in the theory of}} <b>tree</b> <b>shakers</b> used for fruit harvesting. New calculation methods were developed including the vibrating soil mass which enabled the calculation of effective soil masses on a strictly physical basis. However, these earlier investigations did not treat with the effect of stroke frequency. In these investigations, first of all, the friction behavior of the soil mass is discussed as a function of stroke frequency. It turned out that the decrease and shifting of the soil deformation waves as a function of distance measured from the tree trunk are the main sources of an intensive friction between the neighbouring soil layers. As a consequence, the logarithmic decrement (and not the damping coefficient) of the soil will be more or less constant as a function of stroke frequency, at least in the investigated frequency range. At lower attachment heights the soil friction losses dominate independently on stroke frequency. The virtual spring constant of the soil body is also frequency dependent. Due to the presence of combined frictional and viscous losses, the energy method seems to be the best one to analyze the effect of stroke frequency on the various operational parameters...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the suitable stroke and frequency for the detachment percentage of pistachio nut and cluster off the <b>tree,</b> a mechanical <b>shaker</b> was used. In the three experiments with 125 trees from 10 different varieties of pistachios, a 9 Hz frequency and a 25 mm stroke were found to be the most suitable choice for shaking. In the final experiment, 30 trees, 3 replications of 10 different varieties, were trunk shaken with the above stroke and frequency. The test was carried out at the Pistachio Experimental Station in Rafsanjan. As for the ripe nuts, a detachment rate of 95 % was observed, whereas in the case of clusters only a maximum detachment rate of 21 % was recorded and that was for the Reza-I Zoodras variety. Other varieties, namely Ghazvini, Ohadi, Kalleh Ghoochi, Shah Pasand and Momtaze Tajabadi, showed lower cluster detachment. The nut detachment for different varieties was significantly different (a= 0. 01).

40|$|An inertia type {{limb shaker}} were {{developed}} to mechanically harvest of <b>tree</b> fruits. The <b>shaker,</b> hydraulically powered and driven by the tractor power take off, was used for mechanical harvesting of almond. The study included optimum frequency and amplitude to obtain maximum fruit removal percentage, harvesting rate of the shaker. Harvesting rate was calculated by weighing both the harvested and unharvested almonds. In the tests the limbs of trees were shaken at 40 and 50 mm amplitude of the connecting rod attached to the crankshaft and 10, 15, 20 Hz frequencies. The results were analysed according to the maximum fruit removal percentage. Shaking time was 10 s {{for all of the}} frequency and amplitude tests. Maximum fruit removal (97 and 100 %) was achieved by operating the shaker at amplitude of 50 mm and a frequency of 15 and 20 Hz. Therefore it can be suggested an amplitude of 50 mm and a frequency of 20 Hz for mechanical harvesting of almond. Moreover, the appropriate harvesting time for nonpearl variety of almond was found the second week of August. Because, the ratio of Fruit Detachament Force (FDF) to Weight (W) at different maturity times was found 1. 8 N/g at the second week of August...|$|R
40|$|Biodiesel is a {{renewable}} fuel conventionally generated from vegetable oils and animal fats that conforms to ASTM D 6751. Depending {{on the free}} fatty acid content of the feedstock, biodiesel is produced via transesterification, esterification, {{or a combination of}} these processes. Currently the cost of the feedstock accounts for more than 80 % of biodiesel production cost. The main goal of this project was to evaluate and develop non-conventional feedstocks and novel processes for producing biodiesel. One of the most novel and promising feedstocks evaluated involves the use of readily available microorganisms as a lipid source. Municipal wastewater treatment facilities (MWWTF) in the USA produce (dry basis) of microbial sludge annually. This sludge is composed of a variety of organisms, which consume organic matter in wastewater. The content of phospholipids in these cells have been estimated at 24 % to 25 % of dry mass. Since phospholipids can be transesterified they could serve as a ready source of biodiesel. Examination of the various transesterification methods shows that in situ conversion of lipids to FAMEs provides the highest overall yield of biodiesel. If one assumes a 7. 0 % overall yield of FAMEs from dry sewage sludge on a weight basis, the cost per gallon of extracted lipid would be $ 3. 11. Since the lipid is converted to FAMEs, also known as biodiesel, in the in Situ extraction process, the product can be used as is for {{renewable fuel}}. As transesterification efficiency increases the cost per gallon drops quickly, hitting $ 2. 01 at 15. 0 % overall yield. An overall yield of 10. 0 % is required to obtain biodiesel at $ 2. 50 per gallon, allowing it to compete with soybean oil in the marketplace. Twelve plant species with potential for oil production were tested at Mississippi State, MS. Of the species tested, canola, rapeseed and birdseed rape appear to have potential in Mississippi as winter annual crops because of yield. Two perennial crops were investigated, Chinese tallow tree and tung tree. High seed yields from these species are possible because, there stature allows for a third dimension in yield (up). Harvest regimes have already been worked out with tung, and the large seed makes shedding of the seed with <b>tree</b> <b>shakers</b> possible. While tallow tree seed yields can be mind boggling (12, 000 kg seed/ha at 40 % oil), genotypes that shed seed easily are currently not known. Efficient methods were developed to isolate polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters from bio-diesel. The hypothesis to isolate this class of fatty acids, which are used as popular dietary supplements and prescription medicine (OMACOR), was that they bind transition metal ions much stronger than their harmful saturated analogs. AgBF 4 has the highest extraction ability among all the metal ions tested. Glycerol is a key product from the production of biodiesel. It is produced during the transesterification process by cleaving the fatty acids from the glycerol backbone (the fatty acids are used as part of the biodiesel, which is a fatty acid methyl ester). Glycerol is a non-toxic compound with many uses; however, if a surplus exists in the future, more uses for the produced glycerol needs to be found. Another phase of the project was to find an add-on process to the biodiesel production process that will convert the glycerol by-product into more valuable substances for end uses other than food or cosmetics, focusing at present on 1, 3 -propanediol and lactic acid. All three MSU cultures produced products at concentrations below that of the benchmark microorganisms. There was one notable isolate the caught the eye of the investigators and that was culture J 6 due to the ability of this microorganism to co-produce both products and one in particularly high concentrations. This culture with more understanding of its metabolic pathways could prove a useful biological agent for the conversion of glycerol. Heterogeneous catalysis was examined as an alternative to overcome the disadvantages of homogeneous transesterification, such as the presence of salts in the glycerine phase and the continuous lost of catalyst. A maximum soy biodiesel yield of 85 % was obtained by BaO in 14 minutes, whereas, PbO, MnO 2, CaO and MgO gave a maximum yields of 84 %, 80 %, 78 % and 66 % respectively at 215 °C. The overall reaction order of PbO, MnO 2, BaO, CaO and MgO was found to be 1, 1, 3, 1 and 1 respectively. The highest rate constant was observed for BaO, which was 0. 0085 g 2. mole- 2. min- 1. The performance of biodiesel in terms of type (e. g., NOx, and CO) and quantity of emissions was tested using soy biodiesel, blends of biodiesel and ethanol, and differently aged diesel engines. It was determined that saturated methyl esters, and relatively high oxygen content in the fuel, caused by addition of ethanol, increased the NOx emissions from new diesel engines compared to petroleum diesel...|$|R
