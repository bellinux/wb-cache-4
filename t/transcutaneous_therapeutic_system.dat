40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an illustration of}} how an ecosystemic perspective was used in a family therapy case study. Two ecosystemic concepts were used to discuss the case study. They are: the language determination of the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>system</b> as described by Anderson & Goolishian 1988; and the therapeutic formula: stability/ change/meaningful noise as used by Keeney & Ross 1985. The value of the language determination {{of the system is}} that a system such as a family does not determine the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>system</b> but that the system is determined by a problem. The system exists as long as meaning is given by that problem. A <b>therapeutic</b> <b>system</b> can therefore be described as a problem-determined and a problem-solving <b>system.</b> The <b>therapeutic</b> change is a process of co-construction of ideas/meaning that simultaneously makes the co-construction of new realities possible for all members of the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>system.</b> One possible application of the ecosystemic perspective in social work practice is indicated.

40|$|AbstractHypertension is {{the most}} common {{cardiovascular}} disease worldwide. Moreover, management of hypertension requires long-term treatment that may result in poor patient compliance with conventional dosage forms due to greater frequency of drug administration. Although there is availability of a plethora of therapeutically effective antihypertensive molecules, inadequate patient welfare is observed; this arguably presents an opportunity to deliver antihypertensive agents through a different route. Ever since the transdermal drug delivery came into existence, it has offered great advantages including non-invasiveness, prolonged therapeutic effect, reduced side effects, improved bioavailability, better patient compliance and easy termination of drug therapy. Attempts were made to develop the transdermal <b>therapeutic</b> <b>system</b> for various antihypertensive agents, including β-blockers, an important antihypertensive class. β-blockers are potent, highly effective in the management of hypertension and other heart ailments by blocking the effects of normal amounts of adrenaline in the heart and blood vessels. The shortcomings associated with β-blockers such as more frequent dose administration, extensive first pass metabolism and variable bioavailability, make them an ideal candidate for transdermal <b>therapeutic</b> <b>systems.</b> The present article gives a brief view of different β-blockers formulated as transdermal <b>therapeutic</b> <b>system</b> in detail to enhance the bioavailability as well as to improve patient compliance. Constant improvement in this field holds promise for the long-term success in technologically advanced transdermal dosage forms being commercialized sooner rather than later...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{perception}} and experience of health, illness and health care among Congolese refugees. It discusses the role of education, with a particular emphasis on schools, in promoting health in the Congolese refugee community, alongside {{the role of the}} Home Office, the health care sector and the Congolese refugee community itself. The thesis identifies three <b>therapeutic</b> <b>systems</b> used by Congolese refugees. These are the Congolese traditional <b>therapeutic</b> <b>systems,</b> the Christo-spiritual <b>therapeutic</b> <b>systems</b> and biomedicine. Analyses of the data demonstrate that in the quest for health, Congolese refugees develop six approaches or options. This is due to their perceptions of illness/disease or predicament, their experiences in the British health care sector as well as their concepts of risk. Moreover, analyses of the fieldwork data establish a correspondence between the conditions in exile and the Congolese refugees' health. Thus, to promote Congolese refugees' health in London, the thesis argues that their culture, their socio-economic and political conditions as well as their experiences in British health care sector must be considered. This, however, cannot be the concern of a single group. It requires the intervention of schools, the Home Office, the health care sector, and the Congolese refugees themselves. The thesis ends by evaluating its main arguments in the light of Congolese refugees' therapeutic options as well as its methodological stances...|$|R

Several strategies have been accomplished using anticancer drugs that non-covalently and covalently incorporate onto AuNPs as a drug delivery carrier. Alternatively, AuNPs were developed by regulating host-guest complexation processes inside the cell, allowing control of the therapeutic effect of the AuNP. In addition, by using host-guest chemical events on the AuNPs, exocytosis of the AuNPs was controlled, enabling their prolonged retention inside of the cells, providing new strategies for improving conventional drug delivery systems.
