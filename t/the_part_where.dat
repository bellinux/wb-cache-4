5|$|The {{director}} of the episode, Cliff Bole, was a school friend of makeup supervisor Michael Westmore. The scene with Remmick {{at the end of}} the episode was added in post-production, as it was originally scripted to have Riker and Picard come face to face with a full-sized mother creature. <b>The</b> <b>part</b> <b>where</b> the parasite enters Remmick's throat reportedly took many takes because the bulging effect was made by Westmore blowing into air bladders under a false neck, and Bole kept trying to make Westmore hyperventilate from the exertion. The parasites themselves were created by Makeup & Effects Laboratories from a design by Rick Sternbach. A mold of Paul Newman's face was filled with raw meat and then blown up to create the effect used when Picard and Riker fire on Remmick, but both Rick Berman and Peter Lauritson were concerned that it was too graphic. Dan Curry invited his six-year-old son to watch the episode in order to test how children would react to it; the boy reportedly liked it so much that he suggested the creation of a Remmick action figure whose head would blow up by pressing a button. This resulted in Berman deciding to air the episode uncut with the full sequence included.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{recounts the}} events of the game and offers deeper {{insights}} into its story, explaining that Athena wanted Kratos to kill Ares and explaining how she manipulated the other gods, with the exception of Zeus, into aiding Kratos. After learning of Athena's plans, Zeus decides to aid Kratos (with magic and as the gravedigger) with the intention of Kratos becoming the new God of War after killing Ares. Poseidon is persuaded by Athena when she convinces him that Ares brought the Hydra into his domain. Artemis is persuaded because Ares and his minions are destroying her wilderness and its wildlife, and by aiding Kratos she will prevent future destruction. Athena manipulates Aphrodite into believing that Medusa is plotting against her. Hades, however, is omitted from the book, as Kratos does not meet him or gain his magic. Another omission from the book is <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>where</b> Kratos receives a new set of blades from Athena, and the Blades of Chaos is revealed to have been forged by Hephaestus in Tartarus.|$|E

[...] According to Yokoyama and Satou, elements of the story that exhibited strong elements of Japanese culture included the watermelon eating scene, <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>where</b> Gin hits young Hotaru over the head with a stick, and the scene where young Hotaru gets scared at night when she sees the face of a yōkai in the patterns of the wood panels on the ceiling.|$|E

500|$|Fish {{is shown}} {{preparing}} for Fez March 2011 PAX East booth in the 2012 documentary film Indie Game: The Movie, which chronicles {{the stories of}} several indie developers at various stages of their games' development cycles. As a subplot, the film presents Fish amidst a legal dispute with a former business partner that jeopardizes the game's future. The partner, believed to be Jason DeGroot, is portrayed negatively and does not participate onscreen. The film's end credits were later corrected to reflect that Fish's business partner was not asked for input. Game Informer called Fish the film's [...] "most memorable developer", and Rock, Paper, Shotgun wrote that Fish is portrayed as melodramatic, theatrical, and neurotic, {{in a way that}} exacerbates his outspoken public perception.

500|$|Several {{other critics}} have {{commented on the}} live-action sequence. Mediaite's Tommy Christopher wrote in a column that the episode was [...] "capped off by a pitch-perfect parody of The Muppet Show, but veered into adult humor {{that would make the}} Muppet-inspired pottymouths of Avenue Q blush." [...] He commented that <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>where</b> Moe thinks he is kissing Perry's bellybutton and she tells him not to stop [...] "has got to be a first on network television, {{breaking}} the dual taboos of oral sex and puppet-on-human conjugal bliss." [...] The segment was praised by Germain Lussier of /Film, who gave it {{as an example of how}} the show, [...] "every once in a while, [...] does something so outrageous, we all step back and marvel at their brilliance." [...] Joyce Eng and Kate Stanhope of TV Guide named the sequence the second top television moment of the week.|$|E
500|$|Two authors later {{reviewed}} the short film and documented two central themes. The {{first is a}} [...] "Child/Man" [...] theme; the role of both a boy and an adult, which writer James M. Curtis states Jackson plays throughout the music video for [...] "Say Say Say". Curtis writes that the bathroom scene involving the shaving foam is reminiscent of boys copying their fathers. He adds that the scene marks [...] "the distinction between Michael's roles as a Child and as a Man". The writer also highlights <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>where</b> the singer supposedly becomes strengthened with a miracle potion, a further play on the [...] "Child/Man" [...] theme. Furthermore, Curtis observes that Paul and Linda McCartney seem {{to act as if}} they are Jackson's parents in the short film. The author also notes that in a scene where Jackson is handed a bouquet of flowers from a girl, it is a reversal of one from City Lights, a 1931 film starring Charlie Chaplin, whom the singer greatly adored.|$|E

500|$|This {{episode was}} running {{too long to}} use the normal opening sequence. It {{therefore}} did not feature a chalkboard gag or a couch gag.

David Silverman was the director and was somewhat stressed, because he was doing storyboards for this episode while also directing [...] "Bart the Genius". Originally, he had planned to use the song [...] "War" [...] by Edwin Starr in the episode. The plans were dropped, when they decided that the song did not really fit the story.

Peter Shin and Roy Allen Smith, who have since supervised other episodes of Family Guy, both acted as supervising directors on this episode. Alex Borstein, the voice of Lois, helped write this episode, making her the first female member in the Family Guy writing staff; show creator Seth MacFarlane mentioned that her input {{on the character of}} Lois was particularly helpful. Andrew Gormley and voice actor Mike Henry acted as staff writers for this episode, while Ricky Blitt, Neil Goldman and Chris Sheridan worked as the story editors. The subplot of [...] "The Son Also Draws" [...] that involved Lois losing the car was based on the 1985 comedy film Lost in America. <b>The</b> <b>part</b> <b>where</b> Peter pretends to be an Indian to get the family car back was inspired by real-life instances of people who were [...] "1/64th" [...] Native American receiving money from wealthy casino tribes.|$|E
500|$|According to the Domesday Book in 1086, {{the modern-day}} Cheadle and Cheadle Hulme were a single large estate. Valued at £20, it was {{described}} as [...] "large and important" [...] and [...] "a wood three leagues [...] long and half as broad". One of the earliest owners of the property was the Earl of Chester. It was held by a Gamel, a free Saxon, under Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester, and later became {{the property of the}} de Chedle family, who took their name from the land they owned. By June 1294 Geoffrey de Chedle was Lord of the Manor. Geoffrey's descendant Robert (or Roger) died in the early 1320s, leaving the estate to his wife Matilda who held it until her death in 1326. As there were no male heirs the manor, which was now worth £30 per annum, was divided between her daughters, Clemence and Agnes. Clemence inherited the southern half (which would later become the modern-day Cheadle Hulme), and Agnes inherited the northern half, (latterly Cheadle). The two areas became known as [...] "Chedle Holme" [...] and [...] "Chedle Bulkeley" [...] respectively. Shortly afterwards the Chedle Holme estate was divided and <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>where</b> Hulme Hall is now situated became known as [...] "Holme", and held by the Vernons.

[...] Lacroix also commented [...] "If you missed it, get the replay. Don't think, just do it [...] the main event is well worth the price." [...] The main event was given Lacroix's highest match rating of 10 out of 10 in his review. He gave his lowest rating of 4 out of 10 to the opening Six Man Tag Team match. The NWA World Heavyweight Championship bout was ranked with a 7.5 out of 10, while a 7 out of 10 {{was given to the}} NWA World Tag Team Championship contest. Commenting on the main event, Lacroix spoke of it as a [...] "certified match of the year candidate." [...] Going onto describe in detail: [...] "Unbreakable came to a close with mind-boggling main event, featuring a three-way dance between Samoa Joe against AJ Styles against X Division champion Christopher Daniels for the championship title.
