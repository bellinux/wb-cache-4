5|$|For a few centuries, Europeans had {{experimented with}} American vines and plants in their soil, and many {{varieties}} were imported from America without regulation, disregarding {{the possibility of}} pest transfer, and related problems. Jules-Emile Planchon, a French biologist, who identified the Phylloxera in the 1860s, maintained that this transfer of American vines and plants into Europe greatly increased between roughly 1858 and 1862, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> Phylloxera was accidentally introduced to Europe around 1860, although the aphid did not enter France until around 1863. It is believed that the advent of steamships was a factor as well, as the ships were faster, and the Phylloxera were able to survive the quicker ocean voyage.|$|E
5|$|Harvestmen {{are among}} the {{minority}} of living chelicerates that can take solid food, and the group includes predators, herbivores and scavengers. Horseshoe crabs are also capable of processing solid food, and use a distinctive feeding system. Claws at the tips of their legs grab small invertebrates and pass them to a food groove that runs from between the rearmost legs to the mouth, {{which is on the}} underside of the head and faces slightly backwards. The bases of the legs form toothed gnathobases that both grind the food and push it towards the mouth. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> earliest arthropods are thought to have fed.|$|E
5|$|The name {{derives from}} the British Celtic, meaning 'fair, fine, brisk’. It {{is not to be}} {{confused}} with other rivers in the south west of England with the same name. The historic spelling, Froom, is still sometimes used and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> name of the river is pronounced (as in broom). In the nineteenth and twentieth century the River Frome became known in East Bristol as the Danny. The derivation of this name is uncertain, some suggest a nickname, taken from the Blue Danube Waltz, others that it was derived from the Australian slang word dunny.|$|E

50|$|As {{recognition}} of the outstanding services rendered to the medical profession by Dr Wand and Dr Stevenson, a collection was made for their personal benefit.

25|$|The {{tricarboxylic acid}} (TCA) cycle – or citric acid cycle – is an {{important}} step in cellular respiration. In the TCA cycle, a six carbon sugar will be oxidized.

25|$|The WCML was not {{originally}} {{conceived as}} a single trunk route, but was a number of separate lines built by different companies between the 1830s and the 1880s. After {{the completion of the}} successful Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1830, schemes were mooted to build more inter-city lines. The business practice of the early railway era was for companies to promote individual lines between two destinations, rather than to plan grand networks of lines, as it was easier to obtain backing from investors. And so <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> early stages of the WCML evolved.|$|E

25|$|Like {{the rock}} on which Edinburgh Castle is built, it {{was formed by}} an extinct volcano system of Carboniferous age (lava samples have been dated at 341 to 335 million years old), which was eroded by a glacier moving from west to east during the Quaternary (approximately the last two million years), exposing rocky crags {{to the west and}} leaving a tail of {{material}} swept to the east. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> Salisbury Crags formed and became basalt cliffs between Arthur's Seat and the city centre.

25|$|Rabbi Abin the Levite, {{the son of}} Rabbi Judah the Prince, {{taught that}} the Israelites became wealthy from the plague of blood. If an Egyptian and an Israelite were in a house {{where there was a}} barrel full of water, and the Egyptian went to fill a pitcher from the barrel, the Egyptian would find that it {{contained}} blood, while the Israelite would drink water from the same barrel. When the Egyptian asked the Israelite to give the Egyptian some water with the Israelite's own hand, it still became blood. Even if the Egyptian said to the Israelite that they should both drink from one vessel, the Israelite would drink water, but the Egyptian would drink blood. It was only when the Egyptian bought water from the Israelite for money that the Egyptian was able to drink water. And <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> Israelites became rich.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the {{original}} doctrine of Jainism was contained in scriptures called Purva. There were fourteen Purva. These {{are believed to}} have originated from Rishabhanatha, the first tirthankara. There was a twelve-year famine around fourth century BCE. At that time, Chandragupta Maurya was the ruler of Magadha and Bhadrabahu was the head of Jain community. Bhadrabahu went south to Karnataka with his adherents and Sthulabhadra, another Jain leader remained behind. During this time the knowledge of the doctrine was getting lost. A council was formed at Pataliputra where eleven scriptures called Angas were compiled and the remnant of fourteen purvas were written down in 12th Anga, Ditthivaya by the adherents of Sthulbhadra. When followers of Bhadrabahu returned, there was a dispute between them regarding the authenticity of the Angas. Also, those who stayed at Magadha started wearing white clothes which was unacceptable to the other who remain naked. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> Digambara and Svetambara sect came about. The Digambara being the naked ones where as Svetambara being the white clothed. According to Digambara, the purvas and the angas were lost. In course of time, the cannons of svetambara were also getting lost. About 980 to 993 years after the Nirvana of Mahavira, a Vallabhi council was held at Vallabhi (now in Gujarat). This was headed by Devardhi Ksamashramana. It was found that the 12th Anga, the Ditthivaya, was lost too. The other Angas were written down. This is a traditional account of schism. According to Svetambara, there were eight schisms (Nihvana).|$|E

Benin elders were panic-struck, and 'to appease Prince Idu, the kingdom was divided.'

25|$|For {{positive}} integers, this proof can be geometrized: if {{one considers}} the quantity x'n as {{the volume of the}} n-cube (the hypercube in n dimensions), then the derivative is the change in the volume as the side length is changed – this is x'n1, which can be interpreted as the area of n faces, each of dimension n1 (fixing one vertex at the origin, these are the n faces not touching the vertex), corresponding to the cube increasing in size by growing in the direction of these faces – in the 3-dimensional case, adding 3 infinitesimally thin squares, one to each of these faces. Conversely, geometrizing the fundamental theorem of calculus, stacking up these infinitesimal (n1) cubes yields a (hyper)-pyramid, and n of these pyramids form the n-cube, which yields the formula. Further, there is an n-fold cyclic symmetry of the n-cube around the diagonal cycling these pyramids (for which a pyramid is a fundamental domain). In the case of the cube (3-cube), <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> volume of a pyramid was originally rigorously established: the cube has 3-fold symmetry, with fundamental domain a pyramids, dividing the cube into 3 pyramids, corresponding {{to the fact that the}} volume of a pyramid is one third of the base times the height. This illustrates geometrically the equivalence between the quadrature of the parabola and the volume of a pyramid, which were computed classically by different means.|$|E
