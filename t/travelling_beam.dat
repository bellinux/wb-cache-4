40|$|In this paper, {{the dynamic}} {{response}} of a simply supported <b>travelling</b> <b>beam</b> {{subjected to a}} transverse load is investigated in the super-critical speed range. The well-known axially moving beam theory is considered and a simple viscous damping mechanism has been introduced. The displacement field is expanded {{in a series of}} the buckling modes, a sine series, and different techniques have been used in analyzing the response of the dynamical system. Periodic oscillations are studied by means of continuation techniques, while non-stationary dynamics are investigated through direct simulations. A comparison with the literature and a convergence test on the series expansion are performed. A sample case of a physical beam is developed and numerical results are presented concerning bifurcation analysis and stability, and direct simulations of global postcritical dynamics. A complex scenario of alternate regular and chaotic motions is found in a large range of the main parameters...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of pulley {{eccentricity}} on the vibration of a power transmission belt is experimentally investigated and a theoretical model is developed for validation and identification purposes. This eccentricity gives rise to dangerous operating conditions for the system, especially when it excites the frequency range of the belt resonances. As expected, the system shows a hardening non-linear behavior. Moreover, the fluctuation of the belt tension, due to the pulley eccentricity, {{gives rise to a}} parametric instability that can cause catastrophic failures of the structure. Laser displacement transducers are used to measure transversal vibrations of the belt. An approximate analytical solution of the <b>travelling</b> <b>beam</b> dynamics is developed in order to model the system and reproduce the experimental data. Comparisons between analytical solution and experimental data allow the identification of the unknown parameters of the analytical model. A validation of the identified model is performed by comparing analytical and experimental data in different operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} vibration of a <b>travelling</b> <b>beam</b> {{subjected to}} principal parametric resonance in presence of internal resonance is investigated. The beam velocity {{is assumed to}} be comprised of a constant mean value along with a harmonically varying component. The stretching of neutral axis introduces geometric cubic nonlinearity in the equation of motion of the beam. The natural frequency of second mode is approximately three times that of first mode; a three-to-one internal resonance is possible. The method of multiple scales (MMS) is directly applied to the governing nonlinear equations and the associated boundary conditions. The nonlinear steady state response along with the stability and bifurcation of the beam is investigated. The system exhibits pitchfork, Hopf, and saddle node bifurcations under different control parameters. The dynamic solutions in the periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic forms are captured with the help of time history, phase portraits, and Poincare maps showing the influence of internal resonance...|$|E

Combining imaging and spectra from LOFAR the apparent {{velocity of the}} type III exciter is estimated without the assumption of a density model. The observations suggest that the type IIIs are emitted by an electron <b>beams</b> <b>travelling</b> at relativistic velocities, much faster than predicted from typical coronal models.

Each <b>beam</b> <b>travels</b> a different {{leg of the}} tube, is reflected at the mirror at left, and returns through the opposite leg of the tube. Thus, both <b>beams</b> <b>travel</b> the same path, but one {{in the direction of}} flow of the water, and the other opposing the flow.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to a dynamic {{stability}} analysis of an axially moving elastic web, modelled as a panel (a plate undergoing cylindrical deformation). The results are directly applicable also to the <b>travelling</b> <b>beam.</b> In accordance with the dynamic approach of stability analysis, the problem of harmonic vi- brations is investigated via {{the study of the}} dependences of the system’s nat- ural frequencies on the problem parameters. Analytical implicit expressions for the solution curves, with respect to problem parameters, are derived for ranges of the parameter space where the natural frequencies are real-valued, corresponding to stable vibrations. Both axially tensioned and non-tensioned travelling panels are considered. The special cases of the non-tensioned trav- elling panel, and the tensioned stationary (non-travelling) panel are also dis- cussed, and special-case solutions given. Numerical evaluation of the obtained general analytical results is discussed. Numerical examples are given for panels subjected to two different tension levels, and for the non-tensioned panel. The results allow the development of very efﬁcient, lightweight solvers for deter- mining the natural frequencies of travelling panels and beams. The results {{can also be used to}} help locate the bifurcation points of the solution curves, corre- sponding to points where mechanical stability is lost...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the {{stability}} {{investigation of the}} linear responses of axially <b>travelling</b> <b>beams</b> supported by an intermediate linear spring is performed numerically by means of searching linear complex eigenvalues. The boundary conditions and the dynamic equation of motion are obtained {{by means of the}} Extended Principle of Hamilton for the two-span Euler-Bernoulli beam. Assuming the harmonic solution of the governing differential equations of motion, the dispersion relation is derived. To have a nontrivial solution in conjunction with the dispersion relation, the frequency equation is obtained by letting the determinant of the matrix representing the coefficients of the equations of the boundary conditions be equal to zero. The aim of this contribution is to compute the complex values of the natural frequencies from the nonlinear frequency equation by means of numerical methods for the beam supported by an intermediate spring. The real and imaginary parts of the complex eigenvalues versus the constant axial transport speed curves are depicted in order to show the linear instability. Depending on the signs of the real and imaginary parts of the complex eigenvalues, the boundaries of the instability regions were observed...|$|R
