5|$|Governance of {{the states}} is divided between <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> and the state governments, with {{different}} powers reserved for each, and <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> government has direct administration of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> territories. Lower-level administration is carried out by local authorities, which include city councils, district councils, and municipal councils, although autonomous statutory bodies can be created by <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> and state governments to deal with certain tasks. <b>The</b> <b>federal</b> constitution puts local authorities outside of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> territories under the exclusive jurisdictions of the state government, although in practice <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government has intervened {{in the affairs of}} state local governments. There are 144 local authorities, consisting of 11 city councils, 33 municipal councils, and 97 district councils.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> {{constitution}} {{provided that}} details concerning <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> institutions, {{such as their}} locations, should {{be taken care of}} by <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Assembly (BV 1848 Art. 108). Thus on 28 November 1848, <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Assembly voted in majority to locate the seat of government in Berne. And, as a prototypical federal compromise, to assign other federal institutions, such as <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Polytechnical School (1854, the later ETH) to Zurich, and other institutions to Lucerne, such as the later SUVA (1912) and <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Insurance Court (1917).

5000|$|With {{six games}} {{left in the}} season, Bernhard (who once called <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> [...] "trained gerbils") gave up and sold <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> to Florida real estate {{developer}} Woody Weiser, who announced plans to move <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> to Miami as The Spirit of Miami. Weiser quickly signed up Howard Schnellenberger as part-owner, general manager and head coach after the season ended.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Federals</b> saved {{their best}} game for {{last in the}} 1983 season. Playing at home against the Philadelphia Stars, <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> shocked <b>the</b> league by {{defeating}} the 15-2 Stars 21 to 14. When all was said and done, despite <b>the</b> fact <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> were a mere 4-14, there was one positive, they had defeated both teams who later played in the USFL championship game that year.|$|R
2500|$|As Mosby {{approached}} Leesburg his scouts {{reported to}} him the presence of <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> under Forbes in the town. In response Mosby led the Rangers into camp west of Leesburg on Catoctin Mountain where the Rangers spent <b>the</b> night. <b>The</b> <b>Federals</b> departed from Leesburg the next morning, July 6, and headed south by Oatlands Mill and on to Aldie. At around 6 p.m. <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> arrived at <b>the</b> intersection with the Little River Turnpike and [...] stopped to rest {{for an hour or}} so at the Skinner farm near Mount Zion Church. Meanwhile, Mosby entered Leesburg shortly after <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> left and learned of their withdrawal. He led the Rangers out of town towards Ball's Mill on the Carolina Road, believing that <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> had returned on the same route they had arrived on. At Ball's Mill Mosby was informed by local citizens of his mistake, whereupon he devised a plan to head southeasterly towards Gum Springs (present day Arcola) and intercept <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> as they traveled east on the Little River Turnpike.|$|R

50|$|The Blitz, led {{by former}} Lions and Colts Quarterback Greg Landry, raced out to a 28-0 lead. <b>The</b> <b>Federals</b> were so terrible in the game, the Blitz held Washington to only one first down, and a mere 24 yards total offense in the first half. Chicago led 21-0 before <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> ever {{recorded}} a second first down. By that time, Landry hit 15 of his first 17 pass attempts, including a 23-yard touchdown pass to Trumaine Johnson. Kim McQuilken had a horrible debut as <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> quarterback, {{and was replaced by}} back up Mike Hohensee.

5|$|Citing {{the trust}} {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> {{government and the}} tribes, the Court held that removal treaties could only be enforced against the tribes by <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government, not private parties (whether through self-help or through the courts). In other words, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government retained the discretion not to enforce such treaties. At the same time, the Court held that enrolled treaties are conclusively valid, and refused to consider the plaintiffs claim that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838) was fraudulent.|$|E
5|$|Flournoy {{continued}} {{to expand his}} law practice by winning large contracts. In March 1933, he offered the lowest bid of $3,745 for a contract that supplied certificates of land title in Kanawha and Fayette counties within the Huntington federal engineering district.

50|$|Around {{the same}} time, Weiser {{pulled the plug}} on his deal to buy <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> and move them to Miami. Bandits {{minority}} owner Donald Disney stepped in 5 days later and bought <b>the</b> <b>Federals.</b> Under his ownership, the team was moved to Orlando, where they became the Orlando Renegades.|$|R
50|$|By early dawn, <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> {{had reached}} Broad Run on the Leesburg Pike, and stopped briefly {{at a house}} off the Road to inquire as to the {{whereabouts}} of the Miskel Farm. After receiving the information, they set out towards Miskel Farm and Mosby's unsuspecting men. As fate would have it, Ranger Dick Moran had been in <b>the</b> house <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> stopped at visiting friends. As soon as <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> left, he mounted his horse and took off across the fields to warn Mosby and his fellow Rangers.|$|R

5|$|Germany has a {{civil law}} system based on Roman law with some {{references}} to Germanic law. The Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review. Germany's supreme court system, called Oberste Gerichtshöfe des Bundes, is specialised: for civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice, and for other affairs the courts are <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Labour Court, <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Social Court, <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Finance Court and <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Administrative Court.|$|E
5|$|If <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> {{property}} is an enclave, then <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government has exclusive jurisdiction, unless the state reserved rights when it ceded {{the land to}} <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government. The Assimilative Crimes Act makes it a federal crime to violate a state law while at a federal enclave in that state. The Assimilative Crimes Act only applies to criminal laws (not regulatory laws), and is not applicable if the conduct is already regulated by federal law. Under federal law, military facilities are required to adopt state traffic laws, but the base commander is permitted to institute additional traffic laws.|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately, the 1984 season came unraveled in a hurry. The league {{scheduled}} <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> to open {{against the}} expansion Jacksonville Bulls in a probable {{effort to help}} <b>the</b> get <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> {{off to a good}} start. Unfortunately, that plan backfired when the Bulls crushed <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> 53-14. Hours before <b>the</b> game, <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> cut all three of their starting linebackers, a move which hobbled the defense. The embarrassing loss forced Bernard to act to save face for his franchise. Jauch was fired after the game and replaced by former Maryland Terrapins and Dallas Cowboys running back Dick Bielski. In week 2, James suffered a season-ending injury. At that point, the season became a total fiasco --- even though Hohensee played fairly well for a second year starter finishing the season with a very respectable QB rating (for the USFL) of 72.2.|$|R
5|$|In 2012, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> {{government}} {{accounted for}} about 29% of the jobs in Washington, D.C. This is thought to immunize Washington to national economic downturns because <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government continues operations even during recessions. Many organizations such as law firms, independent contractors (both defense and civilian), non-profit organizations, lobbying firms, trade unions, industry trade groups, and professional associations have their headquarters in or near D.C. {{to be close to}} <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government.|$|E
