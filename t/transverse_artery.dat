40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} periosteal vessels location as intra-operative landmarks in distal femoral osteotomies and focused on the branching pattern of the vascular supply of the medial and lateral femoral condyle, its constancy, and the relationship to the height of distal femoral osteotomies. Anastomoses of relevant vessels were studied to analyze the risk of vascular insufficiency after transection of landmark vessels. METHODS: A human cadaver dissection study on the vascular supply of the medial and lateral side of the distal femur was conducted. Surgical dissection was performed in eight knees in total. Distances between the vascular supply and bony landmarks were calculated. Relation of the vascular structures to the transverse bone cuts of distal femoral osteotomies was described, as well as anastomoses of relevant vessels. RESULTS: On the medial side of the distal femur the periosteum was primarily supplied by the descending genicular artery (DGA) in 87. 5 % of the specimens. In the absence of the DGA, the superior medial genicular artery was the supplier. Vascularization took place through two constant branches, the upper <b>transverse</b> <b>artery</b> (UTA) and the central longitudinal artery. The UTA originated at a mean distance of 6. 9 cm (range 5. 9 - 7. 9 cm) above the knee joint line. On the lateral side of the distal femur the superior lateral genicular artery was the main vessel. In all dissected knees it gave off the lateral <b>transverse</b> <b>artery</b> (LTA). The LTA originated at a mean distance of 6. 9 cm (range 5. 8 - 7. 6 cm) above the knee joint line. Anastomoses between the UTA, LTA and the longitudinal arch of the femoral shaft were found that could prevent vascular insufficiencies after transection of the UTA and LTA. CONCLUSIONS: The vascular supply of the medial and lateral aspects of the femoral condyle is highly constant. Both the UTA, on the medial side, and the LTA, on the lateral side, can serve as a landmark for orthopedic surgeons in determining the height of the osteotomy cuts in distal femoral osteotomies. Transection of these landmark vessels during the osteotomy will not result in vascular insufficiency because of a collateral supply...|$|E

A middle cerebral arterial ramus could provide a collateral source. The septum receives supply exclusively from the anterior cerebral artery. A rostral lesion in the medial septum would most likely involve arteries supplying more caudal structures including hippocampal afferent and efferent fibers. No anastomoses between septal arteries or with middle or posterior cerebral arterial rami were observed. The cingulate cortex receives anterior cerebral arterial branches with the middle cerebral artery being a collateral source. The amygdala and overlying cortex receive branches of the internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries. Transverse arteries in the hippocampal fissure stem from the longitudinal hippocampal artery, a branch of the posterior cerebral artery, to nourish the hippocampus and portions of the fascia dentata. Other branches supply the remainder of the fascia dentata, entorhinal and subicular structures, and certain vessels anastomose with middle cerebral arterial rami.

Cordova A, D'Arpa S, Pirrello R, Brenner E, Jeschke J, Moschella F. Source Cattedra di Chirurgia Plastica e Ricostruttiva, Dipartimento di Discipline Chirurgiche ed Oncologiche, Università degli Studi di Palermo, Via del Vespro, 129 - 90127, Palermo, Italy. adriana. cordova. unipa@gmail. com Abstract BACKGROUND: Vessels in the supraclavicular area and their contribution to skin vascularization have always been studied for flaps planning in head and neck reconstruction and many pedicled flaps have been described based on those vessels. Little has been written instead about the vascularization of the supraclavicular skin itself for the use as a free flap. The purpose of this anatomical study {{was to assess the}} vascularization of the supraclavicular skin and the possibility of finding an adequate pedicle to harvest it as a free flap in order to close the donor site directly. METHODS: A total of 25 cadavers, 10 formalin fixed and 15 fresh, have been studied in cooperation with the Division for Clinical-Functional Anatomy, Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria and the Laboratoire d'Anatomie, Universiteé R. Descartes, Paris, France. RESULTS: The supraclavicular skin was nourished by perforators coming from the <b>transverse</b> cervical <b>artery</b> and constantly present in an average number of four. Venous drainage was accomplished through the superficial cervical vein, and not through the venae comitantes of the <b>transverse</b> cervical <b>artery.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this investigation, a free supraclavicular <b>transverse</b> cervical <b>artery</b> perforator (STCAP) flap seems to be feasible pedicled on perforators from the <b>transverse</b> cervical <b>artery</b> and drained by the superficial cervical vein. Due to its thickness and skin texture, it can be indicated for facial and intraoral defects, with the limitations of a relatively short pedicle. Primary closure of the donor site can be accomplished concealing the scar in the neck creas...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} of the course and {{distribution}} of blood vessels supplying and draining the hippocampus. Such information could be of value in designing and evaluating lesion and ablation experiments and may reflect spatial properties of neurons. This study mapped the distribution of major arteries and veins of the rat hippocampal formation. Arteries and veins of adult female Wistar rats anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital were injected with silicone rubber. Double injections to demonstrate both arteries and veins in the same animal were with India ink and a fluorescent material. Arterial supply to the hippocampus was via <b>transverse</b> hippocampal <b>arteries</b> that stemmed from the longitudinal hippocampal artery, {{a branch of the}} posterior cerebral <b>artery.</b> Internal <b>transverse</b> hippocampal <b>arteries</b> located in the hippocampal fissure supplied small, short branches to the adjacent blade of the fascia dentata, part of the area dentata, and CA 3 fields. Other branches of the longitudinal artery supplied the remaining blade of the fascia and area dentata, subicular fields, and entorhinal structures. Internal transverse hippocampal veins located in the hippocampal fissure alternated in position with the arteries and appeared to be paired with, and to drain fields supplied by, the internal <b>transverse</b> <b>arteries.</b> Deep <b>transverse</b> hippocampal veins, unaccompanied by arteries, received branches in the intraventricular alveus and adjacent stratum oriens of CA 3. The transverse veins drained into longitudinal vessels or the basal vein. Although transversely directed arteries and veins may suggest a hippocampal lamellar neuronal organization, microvascular fields must be mapped before claims are made for a totally segmental vascular architecture in the hippocampus...|$|R

40|$|The {{accessory}} ascending cervical artery (Murakami et al., 1996), which {{arises from}} the subclavian artery and ascends between the scalenus anterior and medius muscles, was studied in 87 Japanese adult cadavers (174 sides), with special attention being given to its origin, distribution, and relationship to other arteries at the cervical or scalenus region. In 154 sides (88. 5 %), the accessory ascending cervical artery was found to originate from the subclavian artery behind the scalenus anterior muscle, and to branch out to the scalenus anterior and medius muscles {{as well as those}} entering the 5 th and 6 th intervertebral foramens along the 6 th and 7 th cervical nerves. This artery arose independently in 105 sides. The accessory ascending cervical artery issued off or formed a common trunk with the <b>transverse</b> cervical <b>artery</b> and/or costocervical trunk in 49 sides. In cases lacking the accessory ascending cervical artery, it was usually compensated for by the costocervial trunk and/or <b>transverse</b> cervical <b>artery</b> (18 sides). Common trunk formation with the vertebral, internal thoracic, or suprascapular arteries was not observed. The authors suggest that the accessory ascending cervical <b>artery,</b> the <b>transverse</b> cervical <b>artery,</b> and the costocervical trunk should be grouped into one arterial system, a system that may be a remnant of the precostal longitudinal anastomoses of intersegmental arteries of the dorsal aorta behind the scalenus anterior muscle. </p...|$|R

The descending {{branch of the}} <b>transverse</b> cervical <b>artery</b> anastomoses with the deep and dorsal scapular artery which in turn links to the subscapular.

40|$|Earlier {{investigations}} in this laboratory demonstrated paired internal <b>transverse</b> <b>arteries</b> and veins {{associated with the}} rat cornu Ammonis (CA), mapped the vessels, and suggested segmental distribution and drainage patterns. Further studies of the smaller branches and capillaries were required to resolve {{the presence or absence}} of structurally segmented or isolated capillary beds common to vertebrate forms having paired intramedullary arteries and veins. Adult Wistar rats were injected with inks to demonstrate the arterial or venous tree or both. Each of the CA 3 internal <b>transverse</b> <b>arteries</b> usually supplies numerous small-diameter branches to the adjacent blade of the fascia dentata. Often a major ramus supplies CA 1 before the artery branches most profusely near the deepest point of the hippocampal fissure to supply the extrahilar CA 3 and portions of the area dentata. Other vessels are located in the subiculum, adjacent regions of CA 1, and the area dentata. Branches of the CA 3 vessels more nearly parallel the lateral hippocampal axis than either of the other two. Numerous microvascular rami distribute obliquely across the longitudinal and transverse axes. As readily observed from thick, cleared India ink tissue sections, the strata molecularelacumosum and oriens are more vascular than the stratum radiatum where the long axis of capillaries tends to be oriented parallel to the apical dendrites. Clearly a subzone of CA 1 stratum pyramidale, but not CA 3, is the least vascular CA region. The outer portion of stratum moleculare of the fascia dentata is more vascular than the inner third. Well-developed capillary plexuses exist adjacent to the vascular poor zone of stratum granulosum and CA 1. Branches of the internal transverse veins, deep veins, and external veins drain CA 3 fields. Evidence of nonexclusive pairing of the internal arteries and veins, multiple systems draining the CA 3 field, and the presence of anastomosing capillary beds indicate that structurally isolated segmental microvascular organizations do not exist for CA 3 of the rat hippocampus...|$|R
