40|$|The {{demand for}} {{portable}} permanent sources of electrical energy increases {{every day to}} power portable or non-accessible devices. Energy harvesting from vibrations offers a non-traditional source of energy. It is renewable and prevailing, since nature around is rich in kinetic energy that can be harvested. In this work, we have developed two mechanisms to harvest energy from low-frequency vibrations present in nature using electromagnetic transduction. The harvesting mechanisms use a mass-on-spring mechanical oscillator <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> from a host body. Prototypes embodying the two harvesting mechanisms were fabricated and tested. We identi ed the system parameters of the harvester prototypes and generated their frequency-response curves. We analyzed the results using and compared them with mathematical models of the system dynamics to characterize the harvesters' performance including their output power, center frequency, and harvesting bandwidth. We were successful in demonstrating energy harvesters that can harvest low-frequency vibration with center frequencies {{in the range of}} 8 - 14 Hz, harvesting bandwidth in the range of 8 - 12 Hz, and output power on the order of 1 mW.

40|$|The {{interest}} in scavenging various energy sources {{from the environment}} is rapidly increasing. Thanks to the advances in developing effective energy harvesters researches. Kinetic energy is a renewable source {{and it can be}} found numerously in the environment. One of the most popular class of the kinetic energy harvesters in this field is vibration energy harvesters (VEH). It is an electrical source that converts the vibrational energy into usable electrical energy to power up low-power portable or unreachable devices. The harvesting system can be self-powered as stand-alone or as alternative power source depending on the application. In this thesis, we have studied and developed two architectures for electromagnetic VEHs: a baseline VEH and a springless VEH. We introduced and studied power management circuits consisting of a full-wave bridge rectifier and a smoothing capacitor. Moreover, electromechanical model was developed and validated by the comparison to the experimental data. The basic electromagnetic VEH uses a mechanical mass-damper-spring oscillator <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> from vibrations. It has an electrical transducer using induction between a moving coil and a fixed magnets. It uses a cantilever suspension and operates at a frequency range of 57 - 59 Hz. We re-designed it using 80 turns coil-chip instead of 30 -turns. The springless VEH works in a frequency range of 13 - 18 Hz. It was redesigned to carry 60 -turns coil-chip. The re-design of the VEHs successfully increased the output voltage and power. The maximum power experimentally measured were 14. 3 mW and 12. 27 mW at optimal loads RL of 40 ohm and 3 ohm, respectively. The power management circuits introduced is consist of a MOSFET-based full-wave bridge rectifier and a smoothing capacitor to convert the VEH AC output waveform into a DC signal. We found that this rectifier can effectively convert the VEHs output with high voltage and power efficiencies > 93 %. The smoothing capacitor trades-in the signal ripples for lower voltage and power e efficiencies > 79 %. We identified the model parameters for the cantilever VEH, namely the natural frequency, mechanical Qm and total Qt quality factors, and effective average magnetic field density B. We solved the model equations numerically and analytically to find the eigenvalues, frequency response, output voltage and power. The model results agree with the obtained experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{harvesters}} {{collect and}} convert energy {{available in the}} environment into useful electrical power to satisfy the power requirements of autonomous systems. Vibration energy is a prevalent source of waste energy in industrial and built environments. Vibration-based energy harvesters, or vibration-based micro power generators (VBMPGs), utilize a transducer, a mechanical oscillator in this application, <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> from environmental vibrations and to convert it into electrical energy using electromagnetic, electrostatic, or piezoelectric transduction mechanisms. A key design feature of all VBMPGs, regardless of their transduction mechanism, {{is that they are}} optimally tuned to harvest vibration energy within a narrow frequency band in the neighborhood of the natural frequency of the oscillator. Outside this band, the output power is too low to be conditioned and utilized. This limitation is exacerbated by the fact that VBMPGs are also designed to have high quality factors to minimize energy dissipation, further narrowing the optimal operating frequency band. Vibrations in most environments, however, are random and wideband. As a result, VBMPGs can harvest energy only for a relatively limited period of time, which imposes excessive constraints on their usability. A new architecture for wideband VBMPGs is the main contribution of this thesis. The new design is general {{in the sense that it}} can be applied to any of the three transduction mechanisms listed above. The linear oscillator is replaced with a piecewise-linear oscillator as the energy-harvesting element of the VBMPG. The new architecture has been found to increase the bandwidth of the VBMPG during a frequency up-sweep, while maintaining the same bandwidth in a frequency downsweep. Experimental results show that using the new architecture results in a 313 % increase in the width of the bandwidth compared to that produced by traditional architecture. Simulations show that under random-frequency excitations, the new architecture collects more energy than traditional architecture. In addition, the knowledge acquired has been used to build a wideband electromagnetic VBMPG using MicroElectroMechanical Systems, MEMS, technology. This research indicates that a variety of piecewise-linear oscillators, including impact oscillators, can be implemented on MPG structures that have been built using MEMS technology. When the scale of the MPGs is reduced, lower losses are likely during contact between the moving oscillators and the stopper, which will lead to an increase in bandwidth and hence in the amount of energy collected. Finally, a design procedure has been developed for optimizing such wideband MPGs. This research showed that wideband MPGs require two design optimization steps in addition to the traditional technique, which is used in all types of generators, of minimizing mechanical energy losses through structural design and material selection. The first step for both regular and wideband MPGs minimizes the MPG damping ratio by increasing the mass and stiffness of the MPG by a common factor until the effect of size causes the rate at which energy losses increase to accelerate beyond that common factor. The second step, which is specific to wideband MPGs, tailors the output power and bandwidth to fit the Probability Density Function, PDF, of environmental vibrations. A figure of merit FoM was devised to quantify the quality of this fit. Experimental results show that with this procedure, the bandwidth at half-power level increases to more than 600 % of the original VBMPG bandwidth...|$|E

In this paper, a flow-induced vibration energy converter (FIVEC) is designed to produce power for the UMPs and extend their operational time.

This system shows, in some centimeter-sized configurations, an electrical conversion efficiency that exceeds 8 % at low wind speed (3. 5 m/s).

40|$|Manufacturers of wind {{turbines}} have observed {{a new phenomenon}} that appears in high power {{wind turbines}}: excessive wear in the teeth located at 0 º in the pitch bearing. In order to design more efficient wind turbines, manufacturers are increasing the rotor diameter <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> more <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> from the wind to generate more energy, therefore the stress in the joints/unions is increased, {{which leads to the}} elastic deformation of the system. These stresses and deformations increase {{in all parts of the}} wind turbine, the foundations and the tower, yaw, nacelle, drive train and blade unions. All these cases are mainly static unions, except the drive train that transmits torque, the yaw system that turns the nacelle and the pitch system that turns each blade around its axis. The weight of the blades under movement, always working in the most efficient position, causes micro-movements allowed by the elastic deformations and the backlash of the gear transmission that induce an excessive wear at the zero degree position. The same phenomenon is observed in the yaw system, though to a lesser extent. Despite the manufacturer's efforts, a solution that could be implemented in the near future or easily retrofitted in the wind turbines does not yet exist. The aim of this PhD project is to improve the lubrication of the pitch and yaw gear systems of wind turbines through the use of a novel lubrication system based on an array of micro-fabricated channels fitted at the gears' root (dedendum). A micro-nozzle to continuously inject fresh grease in between the teeth in contact has been designed, manufactured and installed in a test bench of a 2 MW wind turbine pitch system. The test bench has been used to characterize the fatigue behavior of the gear surface using conventional wind turbine greases under real cyclic loads, showing a delay of 2 x 10 ^ 4 cycles in the appearance of wear. The proposed micro-nozzle is expected to be compatible with and easily implemented into both newly designed and in-market models. This novel lubrication system will inject fresh lubricant to the gear contact area even when the wind turbine is generating electricity. Postprint (published version...|$|R

This paper highlights recent developments to prove capabilities of the DEM and to give some answers to challenges : i) use the present DEM to model damage mechanisms (matrix cracking, debonding, fiber break and delamination) in a composite material ii) deal with impact applications using the DEM. All developments are made in the home made software GRANOO (GRANular Objet Oriented) [2]. The capability of the DEM to model matrix cracking, debonding and fiber break is first demonstrated on a so-called representative elementary volume (REV) made of a fiber flooded in a matrix. Modelize the REV with DEM and retrieve suitable homogenized properties is the first challenge reached. Secondly, the ability of the method <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> matrix cracking, debonding and fiber break is qualitatively demonstrated through basic static simulations performed on the REV. The ongoing developments to improve are presented. Then, the Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) test using Discrete Element (DE) is investigated. Contact cohesive laws are identified from experiments and implemented in GRANOO. Simulations of DCB test using DEM are then performed. Results are discussed and ways of improvements are proposed. Finally, the ability of the DEM to simulate impact damage on textile is pointed out. Numerical investigations are based on Ha-Minh & co. Works in [3, 4] taken for reference. The weaving is exactly reproduced with DE. The contact between yarns is naturally taken into account in the DEM. The promising results are commented and the on going developments are exposed.

40|$|Re-entrance {{is a novel}} feature {{where the}} phase {{boundaries}} of a system exhibit a succession of transitions between two phases A and B, like A-B-A-B, when just one parameter is varied monotonically. This type of re-entrance is displayed by the 1 D Bose Hubbard model between its Mott insulator (MI) and superfluid phase as the hopping amplitude is increased from zero. Here we analyse this counter-intuitive phenomenon directly in the thermodynamic limit by utilizing the infinite time-evolving block decimation algorithm to variationally minimize an infinite matrix product state (MPS) parameterized by a matrix size chi. Exploiting the direct restriction on the half-chain entanglement imposed by fixing chi, we determined that re-entrance in the MI lobes only emerges in this approximate when chi >= 8. This entanglement threshold {{is found to be}} coincident with the ability an infinite MPS to be simultaneously particle-number symmetric and <b>capture</b> the <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> carried by particle-hole excitations above the MI. Focussing on the tip of the MI lobe we then applied, for the first time, a general finite-entanglement scaling analysis of the infinite order Kosterlitz-Thouless critical point located there. By analysing chi's up to a very moderate chi = 70 we obtained an estimate of the KT transition as t_KT = 0. 30 +/- 0. 01, demonstrating the how a finite-entanglement approach can provide not only qualitative insight but also quantitatively accurate predictions.
