5|$|Following the Wehrmacht's {{victory at}} Operation Market Garden, Hitler decided {{to launch a}} last-ditch {{offensive}} in the West aiming to catch the Anglosphere forces by surprise, {{with the objective of}} retaking Antwerp, striking the seam between the British and Americans that leads to political as well as military disharmony between the Allies, isolate the 21st Army Group, thereby allowing their encirclement and destruction before the American leadership (particularly <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>leadership)</b> could react and erasing the enemy ground threat to the Ruhr.|$|E
5|$|In December 1959, Manekshaw was {{appointed}} the commandant of the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington. Soon, {{he was in}} middle of an unwanted controversy that almost ended his career. In May 1961, Thimayya resigned as the COAS, and was succeeded by General Pran Nath Thapar. Earlier in the year, Major General Brij Mohan Kaul was promoted to lieutenant general and appointed as the Quarter Master General (QMG) by Defence Minister Menon against the recommendation of Thimayya. This incident had led to Thimayya's resignation. Within no time, Kaul was made the Chief of General Staff (CGS), the second highest appointment at Army Headquarters after the COAS. Kaul soon became close to Nehru and Menon, and even {{more powerful than the}} chief himself. This was not liked by senior army officials, including Manekshaw. He made a few derogatory comments on <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>leadership,</b> which led him to be marked as an anti-national.|$|E
5|$|The First World War, {{which took}} place between 1914 and 1918, saw the {{extensive}} use of artillery, particularly on the Western Front. Technical advances, combined with the relatively static nature of trench warfare, made these guns {{a key element of}} the conflict: over half the casualties in the war were caused by artillery. Artillery guns and their crews were themselves targets, however, and 49,076 members of the Royal Artillery died during the conflict. In the years after the war, many former servicemen, including gunners, found the scale of the losses difficult to deal with, or felt that the events challenged their trust in <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>leadership</b> that had led them into the war. Visual reminders of the conflict were often avoided: mutilated servicemen, for example, were banned in the 1920s from joining in veterans' marches, and those with facial injuries often hid them in public.|$|E
50|$|Much of <b>the</b> black <b>political</b> <b>leadership</b> in {{this area}} came from the ministry, and from Union Civil War veterans. <b>The</b> white <b>political</b> <b>leadership</b> {{featured}} veterans and lawyers.

25|$|Palmerston built {{a strong}} popular {{following}} among the British electorate, by promoting himself, British nationalism, {{and a sense}} of patriotism.

25|$|Hegemony was a term {{previously}} used by Marxists such as Vladimir Lenin {{to denote}} <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>leadership</b> of the working-class {{in a democratic}} revolution.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to fascism, which advocates one-man dominance, Leninism advocates inner-Party democratic collective leadership. Hence, the ideological justification of collective {{leadership in the}} Soviet Union was easy to justify. The physical insecurity of <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>leadership</b> under Stalin, and the political insecurity that existed during Khrushchev's reign, strengthened the political leadership's will to ensure a rule of the collective, and not that of the individual. Collective leadership was a value that was highly esteemed during Stalin and Khrushchev's reigns, but it was violated in practice.|$|E
25|$|In the 1850s, {{as large}} {{plantation}} owners outcompeted smaller farmers, more slaves were owned by fewer planters. Yet poor whites and small farmers generally accepted <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>leadership</b> of the planter elite. Several factors helped explain why slavery was not under serious threat of internal collapse from any move for democratic change initiated from the South. First, given {{the opening of}} new territories in the West for white settlement, many non-slaveowners also perceived a possibility that they, too, might own slaves {{at some point in}} their life.|$|E
