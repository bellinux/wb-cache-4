5|$|After 1907, Cooke's {{dominance}} of the national basketball scene was greatly reduced. He led the team to two more conference titles (1916–17, 1918–19), and one consensus retroactive national championship for the 1918–19 season, but the team was never the consistent winner <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the first decade under Cooke. He retired after the 1923–1924 season. His successor, Harold Taylor, was Cooke's assistant coach in his final season and had previously a successful high school coach; however, he had little success with the Gophers and was fired after never finishing higher than sixth in the conference in three forgettable seasons.|$|E
5|$|Breaking with tradition, the Fighting Irish {{announced}} in June {{that they would}} be wearing their alternative green jerseys instead of blue against USC; Weis noted <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> honor of the 1977Irish team that switched to green jerseys before defeating the Trojans en route to a national championship (Weis was a student at Notre Dame at the time). Previously, the Irish did not let the public know when they would be wearing their green jerseys.|$|E

In August 2013 the council received a planning application from the Church Converts (Manchester) to repair the building and convert it into apartments; the application was granted in February 2014. The redevelopment by CZero Developments consists of 73 private apartments in both the chapel and the Sunday school, with the redevelopment due to be completed by Summer 2017. The building was used for student accommodation from September 2017, with a gym, cinema room, study areas and a lounge.|$|E
5|$|On 12 February 2014, Channel 5 {{confirmed}} to Broadcast magazine <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> {{the process of}} filming a similar documentary, provisionally titled Living on the Social, in which individuals and families would discuss their lives on welfare. The Hull Daily Mail reported in March that Channel 5 were looking at Hull as a potential location for the series, but that the city council had urged residents not to participate. The Yorkshire Post reported a similar approach to residents in Bridlington in April. Love Productions also announced plans for Famous, Rich and Hungry, a two-part documentary for the BBC's Sport Relief that would see celebrities spending time with families experiencing food poverty in order to explore the issue.|$|E
5|$|Since opening, {{there have}} been reports {{relating}} to an increased number of road traffic incidents at Switch Island, the main terminus of the A5758 road. Some road users have noted that a lack of clear road markings and signage may be a contributing factor towards the traffic collisions, whilst Sefton Council noted that they continue to review the operation of the road and associated junctions. Following continued incidents at the junction with Switch Island, the council confirmed in July 2016 <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> talks with Highways England and Merseyside Police with Bill Esterson, MP for Sefton Central, calling for changes to be considered to the road to improve safety.|$|E

5|$|Station to Station was {{recorded}} in late 1975 at Cherokee Studios, Los Angeles. In 1981, NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray surmised that it was cut—"in 10 days of feverish activity"—when Bowie decided {{that there was no}} hope of his producing a soundtrack for The Man Who Fell to Earth. More recent scholarship contends that the album {{was recorded}} over a couple of months—with the sessions beginning in late September or early October 1975 and ending in late November—so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the can before Bowie began his abortive sessions on the soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|The Author's Farce and the Pleasures of the Town {{was written}} during 1729. The first press {{announcement}} of the play appeared on 18 March 1730 in the Daily Post, stating <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> rehearsal. An advertisement appeared in the same newspaper shortly afterwards mentioning restricted seating and high ticket prices, suggesting that the play {{was expected to be}} a popular entertainment. It opened on Easter Monday, 30 March 1730, at the Little Theatre, Haymarket, and shortly thereafter was billed alongside The Cheats of Scapin. The last act was later made into the companion piece to Hurlothrumbo for one show.|$|E
5|$|The Sweet Track {{was used}} only for about ten years; rising water levels may have engulfed it, and {{therefore}} curtailed its use.

Since its discovery, it has been determined that parts of the Sweet Track were built along the route of an even earlier track, the Post Track, which was constructed thirty years earlier in 3838 BC.|$|E

5|$|The oldest {{annotation}} of {{the stone}} is in a church inventory from 1829, and it says that the stone was illegible. Ljungström documented in 1861 <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the rock fence with the inscription facing the cemetery. When Djurklou visited the stone in 1869, {{it was still in}} the same spot. Djurklou considered its placement to be unhelpful because a part of the runic band was buried in the soil, so he commanded an honourable farmer to select a group of men and remove the stone from the wall. The next time Djurklou visited the location, he found the stone raised in the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The {{provenance}} of {{the manuscript}} before the seventeenth century is unclear. From a signature on the flyleaf we know <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> van Vliet's collection in 1659. It was auctioned in 1666, after his death, and probably was purchased by Franciscus Junius, from whose library {{it came to the}} Bodleian as part of the Junius donation (Holt 1878, pp. liv–lvi).|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Halo Wars 2 {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} professional critics. The campaign cinematics, created by Blur Studio, were lauded for their outstanding animation quality. Reviewers found {{the game to}} be very approachable to beginners but felt <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> need of more strategic depth to gain popularity amongst experienced RTS players. Several nuisances present in the game's keyboard and mouse controls left some critics disappointed, however, enhancements made to the gamepad control scheme from the first Halo Wars were praised. Post-release, the game has been supported with additional content and updates such as support for cross-platform play. A campaign expansion, titled Awakening the Nightmare, was released in 2017.|$|E

5|$|About January 1843, on {{the orders}} of the acting Settlement Engineer, Captain D.H. Stevenson, the slab was blown to pieces to clear and widen the {{passageway}} at the Singapore River mouth to make space for Fort Fullerton and the quarters of its commander. Some sources claim that the Superintendent of Public Works, George Drumgoole Coleman, {{was responsible for the}} Stone's destruction, but he was on leave and not in Singapore {{at the time of its}} blasting. Lieutenant-Colonel James Low had petitioned to have the sandstone slab spared, but had been told <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the way of a projected bungalow. On the explosion taking place, he crossed the river from his office and selected fragments that had letters on them. As the fragments were very bulky, he had them chiselled into small slabs by a Chinese man. He selected some of the smaller fragments bearing the most legible parts of the inscription and sent them to the Royal Asiatic Society's museum in Calcutta (now known as the Indian Museum) for analysis, where they arrived in about June 1848.|$|E
5|$|Astrometric {{observations}} {{with the}} Hubble Space Telescope measured an inclination of 53° {{of the outer}} planet d, though this result relies on the precise orbital parameters which have been substantially revised since this was published. The observed transits of e suggest an orbit normal inclined within 9° to the line-of-light, and a possible detection of the transit of an extended atmosphere around 55 Cancri b would, if confirmed, imply that it too is in an orbit that is close to edge-on. Between them, no measurement of c's nor f's inclination has been made. It had been thought that with five planets, the system cannot deviate far from coplanar {{in order to maintain}} stability. An attempt to measure the spin-orbit misalignment of the innermost planet reported <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a nearly polar orbit, but this interpretation of the data has since been challenged by a subsequent study, with noted inconsistencies between the implied and measured stellar rotation.|$|E
5|$|Believed to {{have been}} {{introduced}} by Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud, although some sources, such as Abdel-Wahab, claim <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> use three centuries earlier, the flag was rectangular in shape and divided into nine stripes, the middle one green and double the size of all other bands, while the others alternated between yellow and red. Featured {{in the center of}} the green stripe was the Zulfiqar, the legendary Islamic sword of Ali, with the blade in white and the hilt multicolored. The red and yellow stripes each contained five equidistant symbols, whose order was alternated between each stripe. These symbols were divided into two categories: one red six-sided star voided with a disk of a different color in the center—either a red star and green disk or a white star and blue disk—, and a large disk voided in its lower right by a small disk of different color, with the combination being either a small red disk within a larger blue disk or a small yellow disk within a larger red disk. The first yellow stripe contains three red stars and two blue disks. The second stripe, red in color, contains three green disksand two white stars. The third stripe (second yellow one) is identical to the first, with the exception that the star in its center is white, while the fourth stripe (second white one) is identical to the second stripe.|$|E

5|$|Darwaza and Hafiz Kanaan—another leading al-Fatat {{member from}} Nablus—lobbied Arab groups in Jerusalem to {{advocate}} Syro-Palestinian unity {{before the arrival}} of the King-Crane Commission on 10 June 1919. They first met with Haj Amin al-Husseini and Kamil al-Husayni of al-Nadi al-Arabi party and they immediately expressed their support. They also suggested that Darwaza meet Raghib al-Nashashibi, Hussam ad-Din Jarallah, and Aref al-Dajani, supporters of independence. Darwaza convinced Nashashibi to gather some of the Older Politicians of Jerusalem to a meeting at his house. When it was made clear that Musa al-Husayni, a leader of the Older Politicians, was now in favor of unity, all of the other Older Politicians followed suit. When the commission arrived in Jaffa, it concluded on 27 June <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> favor of Syro-Palestinian unity under a British Mandate.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{dispute the}} exact meaning of Urban's actions. The {{mainstream}} view, exemplified by British historian Peter Jackson, holds that Urban still regarded the Mongols as enemies at this time. This perception began changing {{a few years}} later, during the pontificate of Pope Clement IV (1265–68), when the Mongols were seen more as potential allies. However, the French historian Jean Richard argues that Urban's act signaled {{a turning point in}} Mongol-European relations as early as 1263, after which the Mongols were considered as actual allies. Richard also argues <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> response to this forming coalition between the Franks, Ilkhanid Mongols and Byzantines, that the Mongols of the Golden Horde allied with the Muslim Mamluks in return. However, the mainstream view of historians is that though there were many attempts at forming an alliance, the attempts proved unsuccessful.|$|E
