40|$|Of {{the major}} systems shaping the social ties {{of the modern}} age, the {{telephone}} is undoubtedly {{the one that has}} been studied the least, {{so much so that the}} first historical and social studies on the telephone appeared almost a century after it was invented, thus earning it the label of "neglected medium". The scanty research carried out into non-technological features of mobile technology stands in stark contrast to the social dimension of the phenomenon and the role it plays in making possible to move from the present dynamics of computer-mediated communication to the future perspectives of <b>terminal</b> <b>portability.</b> It therefore becomes of the most importance to understand how mobile technologies are currently and actually used and made meaningful by the social actors in their daily lives (in other words one must understand who uses mobile technologies, how, where and who with and what significance the users invest mobile technology with), how mobile technologies affect and impact on social and communicative interaction, and to what extent they are rooted in culture. This essay, therefore, sets out to investigate the way in which mobile phones play a part in identity-shaping and user-socialization processes, and how usage models and construction of significance activated by the users define and redifine identity and functionality of the mobile phone, generating specific processes for the social shaping of this new soci-technological artifact...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Resulting in the {{security}} of mobile payment are the two main problems of the mobile terminal itself {{and the process of}} wireless communication. As the mobile <b>terminal's</b> own unique <b>portability,</b> small size and low cost nature，it cause that the mobile terminal weak ability of computing encryption. The emergence of mobile phone virus is also a potential security threat to mobile payment. At the same time, the openness characteristic of wireless communication decide to a radio channel can be easily tapped by illegal user. Illegal user can tamper with, delete the intercepted information or pretend legal user to access communication networks to communication. This article presents a mobile payment implement solution with distributed key based on the current mobile multi-interface. Analyzes the workflow of mobile payment and the reasons that cause {{the security}} in the process of mobile payment. Uses the additional equipment to achieve the secret keys distributed storage to improve the ability of test and verify in system and enhance the computing encryption capability of mobile terminal. At the same time, based on the J 2 ME security architecture using the encryption methods of data encryption, digital signature, identity authentication to ensure the security of wireless communication. Gives the hardware design and software design of multi-interface data encryption equipment. And gives the some processes design of mobile client’s software. This solution realizes the high security and low cost of mobile payment, has good applied value and marketable foreground...|$|R
40|$|Abstract–- The basic {{necessary}} {{service in}} mobile networks is global roaming, where personal mobility, <b>terminal</b> mobility and <b>portability</b> in service provider should be supported for making global roaming seamless in future generation. In the current application if a user moves {{from one country}} to other or to other continent user needs to pay roaming chargers to the operator and as the data resides in the home country which makes delays in the call procedures. But in the proposed application it benefits the user by making the number as a local number where ever the user travels. To implement such a global mobile system, a location independent scheme is needed. This scheme requires a large centralized database to connect all non geographical PTNs in order to capture larger {{number of people who are}} going to subscribe in future. So designing efficient database architecture to support location independent scheme with acceptable loads in future is an important issue in the cellular mobile systems. Firstly, tree structured one-root database architecture is designed to support seamless global roaming but practically it’s inefficient. It gives more loads in updating the current locations of the mobile users and increases delay in location tracking. In this proposed distributed multi-tree database architecture with three-level tree structure helps in reducing the database loading, signal trafficking in location registration and finally in delivery of call procedure which makes the database operations easier because this architecture is based on location independent scheme and also gives support to track location in the global mobile system...|$|R
