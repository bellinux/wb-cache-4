500|$|In November 2002, NCMP Steve Chia {{supported}} a motion by the Minister for Education stating that [...] "this House ... (1) supports the new JC [...] curriculum which will better develop thinking, communication and other process skills and {{engage students in}} greater breadth of learning; and (2) endorses greater diversity and opening of new pathways in JC/Upper Secondary education to cater to the different strengths and interests of students." [...] He suggested {{that there should be}} a focus on [...] "creative spontaneity", expressing the view that the education system in 2002 was one that focused on churning out a production line of workers, managers and instruction takers. Given that Singapore had reached the standards of a First World economy, Singapore should focus on instilling an inquisitive spirit within students, to encourage students to ask questions. He placed most emphasis on the importance of ensuring that the focus of education should be character building, stating: [...] "It will be failure of our education system if we are to train our best and brightest with our best resources only to be told <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be the quitters of our society; or that they lack the compassion for the weak and the down; or that they behave in a snobbish class of their own; or behave condescendingly to their peers and followers; or that the elites only care about their own self-interests." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} after the {{publication}} of Newton's article, Lerone Bennett responded with an essay on the film in Ebony, titled [...] "The Emancipation Orgasm: Sweetback in Wonderland," [...] in which he discussed the film's [...] "black aesthetic". Bennett argued that the film romanticized the poverty and misery of the ghetto and that [...] "some men foolishly identify the black aesthetic with empty bellies and big bottomed prostitutes." [...] Bennett concluded that the film is [...] "neither revolutionary nor black because it presents the spectator with sterile daydreams and a superhero who is ahistorical, selfishly individualist with no revolutionary program, who acts out of panic and desperation." [...] Bennett described Sweetback's sexual initiation at ten years old as the [...] "rape of a child by a 40-year-old prostitute." [...] Bennett described instances when Sweetback saved himself through the use of his sexual prowess as [...] "emancipation orgasms" [...] and stated that [...] "it is necessary to say frankly that nobody ever fucked his way to freedom. And it is mischievous and reactionary finally for anyone to suggest to black people in 1971 <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be able to screw their way across the Red Sea. Fucking will not set you free. If fucking freed, black people would have celebrated the millennium 400 years ago." ...|$|E
