2500|$|The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 {{sought to}} address {{discrimination}} in loans made {{to individuals and}} businesses from low and moderate-income neighborhoods.

2500|$|In February 1963, {{members of}} Operación ELA held another reunion and the {{document}} {{that emerged from}} it applied the modifications proposed by the statehood movement but retained Fernós' postures regarding sovereignty and association. The Resident Commissioner presented this draft to Aspinall, eventually reaching Reis, who presented a series of drafts. The third of these reached Fernós and its liberal postures were consonant with his own, {{and he went on}} to analyze it and propose his own changes. Following extensive debate, the proposal was ultimately presented by Aspinall and received the code H.R. 5945. However, <b>the</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>process</b> of the preliminary proposals was rocky and earned the critics of key figures such as US Sen. Henry M. Jackson. At the urgency of US Rep. Leo W. O'Brien, a member of the United States House Committee on Insular Affairs, who suggested it as a strategy to [...] "facilitate" [...] the approval of the project, Muñoz and Fernós had decided to temporarily put aside the demand of sovereignty. Both Aspinall and O'Brien claimed that the final revision would be clear to include this aspect. However, this did not happen. Fernós was forced to reluctantly accept a replacement -"inherent right and juridic capacity to enter into compacts"- {{in order to keep the}} proposal alive. As was the case when confronted with previous strategic obstacles, Muñoz distanced himself from the demand of sovereignty. His use of the term [...] "permanent union" [...] led to a confusion among Congressmen, who believed that only statehood could offer such option.|$|E

Employment of <b>the</b> bottom-up <b>evaluation</b> <b>process</b> to determine <b>the</b> extent to which the objectives are present in the product is accomplished by the utilization of Design Indicators. Management Indicators are proposed as a counterpart to Design Indicators and enable one to measure the extent to which the objectives are realized in a developed product. While Design Indicators focus on design structure characteristics of the product, Management Indicators focus on the acquisitional, behavioral, and maintenance characteristics. To accomplish the validation of the predictive capability, the correlation between the values obtained by utilizing Design Indicators and those obtained by utilizing Management Indicators must be investigated. The author has chosen to study and present the software engineering objectives of reliability and maintainability as they related to a future validation effort...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to characterize and analyze the different existing methods for <b>the</b> <b>evaluation</b> of food and nutrition programs and services in Brazil, through a systematic review of the literature focused on complete articles published in national indexed journals. We searched the PubMed, MedLine and LILACS databases using the following search terms and Boolean operators: “evaluation and program”; “project”; “intervention”; “servisse”; “actions and nutrition”; “nutritional”. The research was restricted to articles written in Portuguese, English and Spanish and published between 2001 and 2015. Twenty-two studies were selected and the analysis indicates; most were carried out through quantitative approaches and external evaluations based on epidemiological theory; participatory evaluation strategies are still uncommon; Impact assessments and implementation were predominant; there is little diversity in terms of references to the theoretical framework in <b>the</b> field of <b>evaluation</b> of health care programs in the planning and execution of <b>the</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>processes</b> analyzed. <b>The</b> results of this study indicate the need for a more comprehensive <b>evaluation</b> considering <b>the</b> complexity of the interventions evaluated using the theoretical-methodological apparatus available in the literature to understand the importance of the different perspectives of the agents involved in <b>the</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R
