5|$|From these positions, the New Zealanders {{were ordered}} to capture Belhamed, Sidi Rezegh proper and Ed Duda. This was to precede a renewed {{break-out}} offensive by the 70th Division. Scobie had informed Lieutenant-General Alfred Godwin-Austen, the XIII Corps commander, responsible for all operations near Tobruk, that the positions between him and Ed Duda were strongly defended. Godwin-Austen assured Scobie that he was {{under no obligation to}} attack until the New Zealand Division had taken Ed Duda. Undertaking a night assault, the New Zealand infantry captured Belhamed despite strong resistance, but their attacks <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> other objectives were repulsed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the rising musical styles, {{especially}} grunge, began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> places {{as the dominant}} styles in the mainstream, which resulted in heavy metal music losing popularity and going underground for a decade. Many Christian metal musicians began to play extreme metal, and soon death metal replaced thrash metal in popularity. Audiences in many underground metal scenes began favoring more extreme sounds and disparaging the popular styles. As with other glam metal acts of the time, Stryper lost popularity and split up in 1993.|$|E

No pogrom took place, which was unusual in Europe in the 14th century, according to historian Raphael Patai.|$|E

5|$|The K–Pg {{extinction}} had {{a profound}} effect on the evolution of life on Earth. The elimination of dominant Cretaceous groups allowed other organisms <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> place, spurring a remarkable series of adaptive radiations in the Paleogene. The most striking example is the replacement of dinosaurs by mammals. After the K–Pg extinction, mammals evolved rapidly to fill the niches left vacant by the dinosaurs. Also significant, within the mammalian genera, new species were approximately 9.1% larger after the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|All {{four main}} Einsatzgruppen {{took part in}} mass shootings {{from the early days}} of the war. Initially the targets were adult Jewish men, but by August the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderly—the entire Jewish population. Initially there was a semblance of {{legality}} given to the shootings, with trumped-up charges being read out (arson, sabotage, black marketeering, or refusal to work, for example) and victims being killed by a firing squad. As this method proved too slow, the Einsatzkommandos began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> victims out in larger groups and shot them next to, or even inside, mass graves that had been prepared. Some Einsatzkommandos started to use automatic weapons, with survivors being killed with a pistol shot.|$|E
5|$|At 08:30 Robertson and Lalor decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> {{companies}} up Baby 700. Instead {{of going}} round {{to the right}} like Tulloch, they went straight up the centre, crossed over the summit onto the northern slope and went to ground. A spur on their left, leading to Suvla Bay, was defended by a Turkish trench system. At 09:15 Turkish troops started moving down Battleship Hill, {{and for the next}} hour they exchanged fire. Where the spur joined Baby 700, a group of Australians from the 9th, 11th, and 12th Battalions crossed Malone's Gully and charged the Turkish trench. A Turkish machine-gun on Baby 700 opened fire on them, forcing them back, followed by a general withdrawal of Australian troops. The Turks had secured Battleship Hill and were now driving the Australians off Baby 700. From his headquarters at the head of Monash Valley, Maclagen could see the Turks attacking, and started sending all available men towards Baby 700.|$|E

5|$|Back in Uppsala, Linnaeus' {{relations}} with Nils Rosén worsened, and thus he gladly accepted {{an invitation from}} the student Claes Sohlberg to spend the Christmas holiday in Falun with Sohlberg's family. Sohlberg's father was a mining inspector, and let Linnaeus visit the mines near Falun. Sohlberg's father suggested to Linnaeus he should bring Sohlberg to the Dutch Republic and continue to tutor him there for an annual salary. At that time, the Dutch Republic {{was one of the}} most revered places to study natural history and a common place for Swedes <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> doctoral degree; Linnaeus, who was interested in both of these, accepted.|$|E
5|$|Behind this combat, {{other ships}} of the centre {{division}} struck the French line, HMS Valiant under Thomas Pringle passing close to Patriote which pulled away, her crew suffering from contagion and unable <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> ship into battle. Valiant instead {{turned her attention}} on Achille, which had already been raked by Queen Charlotte and Brunswick, and badly damaged her before pressing on sail to join the embattled van division. HMS Orion under John Thomas Duckworth and HMS Queen under Admiral Alan Gardner both attacked the same ship, Queen suffering severely from the earlier actions in which her masts were badly damaged and her captain John Hutt mortally wounded. Both ships bore down on the French Northumberland, which was soon dismasted and left attempting to escape on only the stump of a mast. Queen was too slow to engage Northumberland as closely as Orion, and soon fell in with Jemmappes, both ships battering each other severely.|$|E
5|$|Bruce missed {{several weeks}} of the 1991–92 season when he {{underwent}} an operation on a longstanding hernia problem, in which Leeds United, after a season-long tussle, beat Manchester United to the championship by four points. Bruce helped United win their first-ever League Cup in April 1992, captaining the team in the final {{in place of the}} injured Bryan Robson. Injuries continued <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> toll upon Robson during the 1992–93 season, leading to Bruce captaining the team in the majority of United's matches during the first season of the new Premier League. Bruce scored two late goals in a win over Sheffield Wednesday which proved decisive in United winning the inaugural Premier League title, the first time the club had won the championship of English football since 1967, and he and Robson received the trophy jointly after the home victory over Blackburn Rovers on 3 May.|$|E
