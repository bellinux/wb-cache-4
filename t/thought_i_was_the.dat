500|$|Originally, {{the episode}} was not {{planned to be}} {{produced}} during the seventh season. However, just before the writing crew prepared to take their Christmas break, one of the scheduled scripts {{was removed from the}} line-up. In order to meet the deadline, Frank Spotnitz, John Shiban, and Vince Gilligan decided to write a script about [...] "modern medicine versus backyards supernatural arts". Gilligan later joked that [...] "I think I was enlisted for the fact that I'm Southern, and they <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> closest thing they had to a hillbilly on the staff".|$|E
500|$|Sudeep {{received}} national {{recognition for}} {{his performance in}} Eega; Rajinikanth told him, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best villain to date. But you beat me to it". His performance was appreciated by other celebrities such as Akkineni Nagarjuna, Mahesh Babu, and Ram Gopal Varma; Varma said he recognised Sudeep's potential after watching Eega, adding, [...] "Many take his acting in that film for granted, with respect to his expressions when interacting with the fly, but as a director, I know {{how difficult it is}} to act when you are imagining the fly to be there". Sudeep's performance in Naan Ee impressed filmmaker Chimbu Deven, who cast him as the antagonist in Puli (2015).|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{asked him}} [...] {{when he had}} his first inkling of being a zoophile. 'When you're a kid, you're not really aware of too much sexually,' he says. 'But I was always {{interested}} in animals, starting around age 10. It was an extension of my affection for the dog and of my discovery of sex. He's a male. I'm a male. I wanted {{to make him feel}} good.' His attraction to dogs became stronger in his teens and stronger yet in his 20s. 'For years, I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only one who did this,' James says. 'I felt like there was no one I could talk to about this. I definitely knew I wasn't {{going to be talking to}} my parents or my friends about this.' 'This is not a fetish,' James says of his attractions. 'It's an orientation, a lifestyle.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing <b>the</b> right thing. I {{still think}} so. â€” Gilbert, after {{sentencing}} ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Er--I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> on <b>the</b> lake racing Larry Colby," [...] murmured Tom and hid {{his face}} as if in embarrassment. [...] "What did I do?" [...] he faltered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, he would, if he <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hurting <b>the</b> institution. See {{what they}} did to poor little Combes, who mildly claimed to be able to hypnotize people." ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{her mother}} later began {{suffering}} {{as a result}} of the radiation therapy, Ruiz drove daily from her Phoenix workplace to the hospital in Lordsburg. [...] She developed the same symptoms as her mother, whose death made Ruiz feel that she was going to die also. [...] While she didn't die, she did realized how dependent she had been on her mother. [...] She became determined to succeed in her career and started attending assertiveness-training courses offered at the hospital. [...] The courses helped her to increase her self-esteem, set goals, separate herself from her mother, and feel like she was in control of her life. [...] According to Ruiz, this sense of control was illusory: [...] "I didn't realize that it was God who was in control, I actually <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> one in control, can you believe it?!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Edward {{smiled and}} {{answered}} frankly, [...] "Nay, don't mind me. You <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> heir, perhaps. Whom {{did you take}} my brother for last night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Knew--what I am," [...] she said; [...] "knew the impossibility. What, {{they have}} not told you? I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> invalid, the cripple, with every one." ...|$|E
60|$|During {{the night}} I {{had heard of}} a place over on the Surrey side of the Thames, where the Salvation Army every Sunday morning gave away a breakfast to the {{unwashed}}. (And, by the way, the men who carry <b>the</b> banner <b>are</b> unwashed in <b>the</b> morning, and unless it is raining {{they do not have}} much show for a wash, either.) This, <b>thought</b> <b>I,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> very thing--breakfast in the morning, and then the whole day in which to look for work.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{beg your}} pardon, father,' said Louis, smiling, while a tear {{rose to his}} eyes, 'I little <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> obstructing <b>the</b> {{business}} of the nation. What will Sir Miles do to me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{beginning}} to understand your attitude toward me when I first came. You <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in <b>the</b> ring--one of the people who, knowing how bad it was, led investors into this rotten scheme!" ...|$|R
60|$|LUBIN. Have you now? Thats very interesting; for I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{leader of}} the Liberal Party. However, it is {{very kind of you}} to take it off my hands, if the party will let you.|$|E
6000|$|... "But if {{he wanted}} to be an artist, why didn't he say so?" [...] asked Mrs. Strickland at last. [...] "I should have <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> last person to be unsympathetic to -- to {{aspirations}} of that kind." ...|$|E
6000|$|Gus admired {{it as much}} as I did; for {{since my}} return, and {{especially}} since my venison dinner and drive with Lady Drum, he <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> finest fellow in the world, and boasted about his [...] "West End friend" [...] everywhere.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay; and I too don't feel {{as strong}} as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> when <b>the</b> first drink set me up. Great wonder-worker water is! And {{to get it right}} here on <b>the</b> spot! It <b>was</b> heaven--hey, sir?" ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{better in}} <b>the</b> air. But there's {{no reason why}} you shouldn't ride.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it?" [...] she said. [...] "I {{thought him}} the best and he <b>is</b> <b>the</b> best. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that he <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best; and <b>I</b> wasn't. It shall <b>be</b> as <b>I</b> say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I tried. I {{made the}} woman let me in, and I sat where poor Camilla {{used to talk}} to me, and I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> better for facing it out. The {{question}} is whether Mrs. Poynsett will dislike it. She {{has a right to}} be consulted." ...|$|E
60|$|He put the questions--sharp, suspicious, unbelieving questions, {{which clearly}} showed me, as they proceeded, that he <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{victim of a}} delusion, and that he might even have doubted, but for my {{introduction}} to him by Miss Halcombe, whether I was not attempting the perpetration of a cunningly-designed fraud.|$|E
6000|$|... "Until {{you came}} upon me, I {{had lived in}} a world where I was great--alone. I had made myself a life--for that. I had <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> victim of some strange freak of nature. And now my world has crumbled down, in half an hour, and I see another world, other conditions, wider possibilities--fellowship--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were just}} in time, Philip," [...] Francois said, with a feeble laugh, [...] "another step and <b>I</b> should have <b>been</b> down. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> weaker than <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> and <b>the</b> fresh air <b>is</b> well-nigh {{too much for}} me.|$|R
5000|$|... 13. Hydra [...] "At {{one time}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{victim of a}} {{conspiracy}} myself. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> certain that <b>the</b> Admissions Office had salted my classes with carefully selected students, students who had no native tongue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought as}} much--and knowing your admirable {{tenacity}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> convinced {{that you were}} sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach, waiting for the tenant to return. So you actually <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> criminal?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That shook them a bit, I'll warrant!" [...] he continued. [...] "And you <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> mere stone {{reproduction}} {{of one of}} them. But no. The old order changeth. The little finger of the sham d'Urberville can do more for you than the whole dynasty of the real underneath... Now command me. What shall I do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{charming and}} royal young widow was bright, intelligent, {{and had a}} mind of her own; {{it was easy to}} see that. She had formed a scheme for her deliverance, and she had been waiting to find some one to help her carry it out. Now, she <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> man she had been looking for. I was elderly, {{apparently}} respectable, and she had to trust somebody.|$|E
6000|$|And at last {{he spoke}} to her, and his voice was hard and bitter. 'If in very truth thou art my mother,' he said, 'it had been better hadst thou stayed away, and not come here to bring me to shame, seeing that I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> child of some Star, and not a beggar's child, as thou tellest me that I am. Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thee no more.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm very {{thankful to}} {{you for what you}} have done," [...] were his first words, {{accompanied}} by a look that told plainly he felt what he said. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at <b>the</b> end of my string sure, as they say in these parts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure of nothing--now. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{sure about}} <b>the</b> houseboat, but I wasn't," [...] {{answered}} Tom, bluntly. [...] "I'm all mixed up." ...|$|R
2500|$|This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> final appearance. Because <b>the</b> grotto <b>was</b> barricaded by <b>the</b> local government, Soubirous knelt {{outside the}} fence by the riverbank. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at <b>the</b> Grotto, {{at the same}} {{distance}} as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> other times. All <b>I</b> saw <b>was</b> Our Lady... She was more beautiful than ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not scientist, worse luck," [...] Granet replied impatiently, [...] "but I saw {{enough to}} {{convince}} me that they've got the right idea. Sir Meyville <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> man commanding the escort they've given him,--actually rowed me out to the workshop and showed me the whole thing. I tell you I saw it just as you described it,--saw the bottom of the sea, even the colour of the seaweed, the holes in the rocks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, really!" [...] exclaimed Margery. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{first one}} {{out in the}} world to-day. And now, Martin, don't you want to do {{something}} for me? I did not think it would happen, but I am really dreadfully hungry, and couldn't you give me my breakfast now, by myself, before anybody else? I am not particular what I have--anything that is easy to get ready will do--and I would like it down at the very edge of the lake." ...|$|E
60|$|The noise I made as I landed {{beside her}} {{convinced}} the girl {{that the end}} had come, for she <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> dragon; but finally when no cruel fangs closed upon her she raised her eyes in astonishment. As they fell upon me the expression that came into them {{would be difficult to}} describe; but her feelings could scarcely have been one whit more complicated than my own--for the wide eyes that looked into mine were those of Dian the Beautiful.|$|E
60|$|<b>THE</b> SERPENT. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very subtle; but Man is {{deeper in}} his <b>thought</b> than <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>The</b> woman knows {{that there is}} no such thing as nothing: the man knows {{that there is no}} such day as tomorrow. I do well to worship them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was up till {{three o'clock}} again. Once <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> on <b>the</b> track of it. I {{have come to}} the {{conclusion}} now that it's one of those codes that depend upon shifting quantities. I shall start again to-night on a different idea. Shall I show Captain Granet in, sir?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>thought,</b> Muscari, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> failure {{among our}} schoolfellows," [...] he said, [...] "and {{you thought you}} <b>were</b> <b>the</b> success. But <b>I</b> have succeeded more than you and fill a bigger place in history. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> acting epics while you have been writing them." ...|$|R
