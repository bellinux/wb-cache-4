5|$|A common Palestinian dessert {{reserved}} {{only for}} Ramadan is qatayef, {{which could be}} provided by the numerous street vendors in several major Palestinian cities or towns as well as typical Palestinian households. Qatayef is the general name of <b>the</b> <b>dessert</b> as a whole, but more specifically, the name of the batter that acts as a base. The result of the batter being poured into a round hot plate appears similar to pancakes, except only one side is cooked, then folded. The pastry is filled with either unsalted goat cheese or ground walnuts and cinnamon. It is then baked and served with a hot sugar-water syrup or sometimes honey.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Macedonia {{produced}} {{only a few}} fine foods or beverages that were highly appreciated elsewhere in the Greek world, including eels from the Strymonian Gulf and special wine produced in Chalcidice. The earliest known use of flat bread as a plate for meat was made in Macedonia during the 3rdcenturyBC, which perhaps influenced the later trencher bread of medieval Europe. Cattle and goats were consumed, {{although there was no}} notice of Macedonian mountain cheeses in literature until the Middle Ages. The comedic playwright Menander wrote that Macedonian dining habits penetrated Athenian high society; for instance, the introduction of meats into <b>the</b> <b>dessert</b> course of a meal. The Macedonians also most likely introduced mattye to Athenian cuisine, a dish usually made of chicken or other spiced, salted, and sauced meats served during the wine course. This particular dish was derided and connected with licentiousness and drunkenness in a play by the Athenian comic poet Alexis about the declining morals of Athenians in the age of Demetrius I of Macedon.|$|E
25|$|Ladob is eaten {{either as}} a savoury dish or as a dessert. <b>The</b> <b>dessert</b> version usually {{consists}} of ripe plantain and sweet potatoes (but may also include cassava, breadfruit or even corossol) boiled with coconut milk, sugar, nutmeg and vanilla {{in the form of}} a pod until the fruit is soft and the sauce is creamy.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>dessert</b> is {{believed}} to have been created in honour of the dancer either during or after one of her tours to Australia and New Zealand in the 1920s.

In 2008, Helen Leach published The Pavlova Story: A Slice of New Zealand's Culinary History, in which she argued that the earliest known recipe was published in New Zealand. Later research by Andrew Wood and Annabelle Utrecht suggested <b>the</b> <b>dessert</b> originated in the United States and was based on an earlier German dish.|$|E

25|$|Raw kiwifruit {{contains}} actinidain (also spelled actinidin) {{which is}} commercially {{useful as a}} meat tenderizer and possibly as a digestive aid. Actinidain also makes raw kiwifruit unsuitable for use in desserts containing milk or any other dairy products because the enzyme digests milk proteins. This applies to gelatin-based desserts, as well, as the actinidain will dissolve the proteins in gelatin, either liquefying <b>the</b> <b>dessert</b> or preventing it from solidifying.|$|E
25|$|Because Madeira has a {{very high}} acidity, it can be paired with any food, even citrus or balsamic. Also, {{although}} it is sweet, even the Malmsey has a dry finish, so it does not get killed by the sweetness of desserts and pudding. This makes it the most versatile of all dessert wines. Whereas most sweet wines are rendered dry by the sweetness of <b>the</b> <b>dessert,</b> this does not happen with Madeira.|$|E
25|$|For dessert, Ris á la mande is served. Made out of rice, {{it is not}} to be {{confused}} with rice pudding. The chief difference is the whipped cream added to the rice.

An unchopped almond can also be added and hidden in <b>the</b> <b>dessert.</b> The person who finds it in his portion receives a small prize.|$|E

At a restaurant, patrons are helped to make good food-wine pairings by the restaurant's sommelier or wine waiter. Individuals dining at home may use wine guides to help make food–wine pairings. Wine is also drunk without the accompaniment of a meal in wine bars or with a selection of cheeses (at a wine and cheese party).|$|E
