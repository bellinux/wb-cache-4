25|$|The {{story is}} told by a narrator (a lightly fictionalized version of Pushkin's public image), whose tone is educated, worldly, and intimate.

25|$|At {{the height}} of the People Power Revolution, {{military}} reformists, believing that television would be a powerful tool to aid the revolution, attacked and took over the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center. On February 24, 1986, former ABS-CBN talents put the station back on the air and televised <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unfolding uprising, thereby contributing to the strength of the revolt. BBC-2, on the other hand, ceased operations after reformists shut down its transmitter on the following day as Channel 2 frequency was turned over to the Lopezes on July 16, 1986.|$|E
25|$|Thirdly, his {{integration}} of Italian styles with the German tradition he was trained in is perhaps {{more effective than}} that of any Northern painter since Dürer (with the exception of his friend Rubens). His compositions tend to underplay <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> events they depict (in noticeable contrast to those of Rubens), but often show the start of moments of transformation. His figures are relatively short and stocky, and reflect little of classical ideals. Their poses and gestures are unflamboyant, and their facial expressions resemble those in Early Netherlandish painting rather than the bella figura of most Italian Renaissance work.|$|E

25|$|The {{first result}} of the new {{thinking}} was Gluck's reformist ballet Don Juan, but a more important work was soon to follow. On 5 October 1762, Orfeo ed Euridice was given its first performance, with music by Gluck to words by Calzabigi. The dances were arranged by Angiolini and the title role was taken by Guadagni. Orfeo, which has never left the standard repertory, showed the beginnings of Gluck's reforms. His idea was to make <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work {{more important than the}} star singers who performed it, and to do away with dry recitative (recitativo secco, accompanied only by continuo) that broke up the action. The more flowing and dramatic style which resulted has been seen as a precursor to the music dramas of Richard Wagner.|$|E
25|$|The king is {{depicted}} standing upright, three quarters to the left, his head low {{and his feet}} in view, a pose calculated to presenting {{the greater part of}} his person. The king occupies the central space of the painting whose composition is constructed from vertical lines (column, king, throne) and a pyramid in which the sovereign inscribes, which creates an elevated space. <b>The</b> <b>drama</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scene is accentuated by a heavy draped curtain which traditionally means that the king does not appear but appears. A large marble pillar, traditional evocation of power since the Renaissance (as a stability symbol, the world axis that unites the earthly and heavenly powers) holds the composition left. The massive barrel rests on a stylobate whose two visible sides are decorated with reliefs depicting two royal virtues: The allegories of Justice (front) and strength (left, very difficult to see).|$|E
25|$|A new wing, {{called the}} Millennium Wing, was opened in 2002. Unlike the {{previous}} two extensions, this new wing has street frontage and the English architects Benson & Forsyth gave it an imposing Bowers Whitbed, Portland Stone façade and grand atrium. The design originally involved demolishing an adjoining Georgian terrace house and its ballroom mews; however, the Irish planning appeals authority, An Bord Pleanála, required that they be retained. The Millennium Wing {{is not without its}} critics: it is unforgiving of poor maintenance and the compromise in the design as required by An Bord Pleanala resulted in a final design diluted from the original competition winning building concept. The circulation space also lacks clarity, but it is generally considered that these flaws are trivial details set against <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. In line with its Brutalist style, the interior concrete walls are still unsealed.|$|E
50|$|During the Italian Renaissance, {{there was}} a renewed {{interest}} in <b>the</b> theatre <b>of</b> ancient Greece. <b>The</b> Florentine Camerata crafted the first operas out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intermezzi that acted as comic or musical relief during <b>the</b> <b>dramas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time. These were based entirely on the Greek chorus, as historian H.C. Montgomery argues.|$|R

25|$|The {{music by}} Torrejón conserves {{much of the}} {{character}} and the idiosyncrasies contained in the comedies of Calderón as previously set by Juan Hidalgo. It is speculated that Torrejón {{may have been one}} of Hidalgo's pupils and that his work was possibly a source of inspiration for Torrejón in the composition of his own version. The score makes use of a variety of Spanish song types and Latin American musical influences, incorporating Latin American melodies and rhythms into the overall European dramatic and harmonic structure. The erotic nature of the text is heightened by the use of dance rhythms, musical repetitions, and sensual lyrical lines. The ornamental writing is also used deftly to emphasize <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text. The exact instrumentation has not been found in Torrejón y Velasco's surviving original scores. However, the scores of other late seventeenth century musical plays in Spain suggest that the instruments would include harps, guitars, viols, violins, clarino and regular trumpets, drums, and castanets.|$|E

500|$|Clark's adoptive father.

You're talking about having a situation where whatever the action is or whatever <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movie is, our first priority is to make sure it's rendered in the most realistic way we can get at." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{film the}} aerial dogfight, a [...] "Snakehead" [...] camera was built {{and placed on}} the nose and tail of a Piper Aerostar 700. SolidWorks, who {{provided}} the software used to design the camera, stated [...] "pilots {{for the first time}} can fly as aggressively as they dare without sacrificing <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shot." [...] The camera could turn 360 degrees and was shaped like a periscope. The crew also mounted SpaceCams on helicopters, and placed cameras with 1600mm lenses underground, to cover the action. Forster wanted to film the plane fight as a homage to Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest, and chose planes like the Douglas DC-3 to suit that.|$|E

[...] Parliament voted Leopold £50,000 per year, purchased Claremont House for the couple, and allowed them a generous single payment to set up house. Fearful of a repetition of the Orange fiasco, George limited Charlotte's contact with Leopold; when Charlotte returned to Brighton, he allowed them to meet only at dinner, and never let them be alone together.|$|E

500|$|Coomer wasn't {{the only}} band member that struck a nerve with Tweedy during the {{recording}} sessions.

Although Bennett conceded that O'Rourke did {{a better job of}} mixing the song, animosity arose between the two engineers. O'Rourke continued to remix more songs, and attempted to increase <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album by reducing the contributions by the backing members of Wilco. He removed so many parts on some songs that only music by Tweedy, Kotche, and himself—the three members of Loose Fur—appeared on those pieces.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the score, Bates uses a {{combination}} of techniques [...] "to increase <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game" [...] said Emily McMillan of Game Music Online, who gave the album a 4 out of 5 stars. She said one of Bates's signature techniques is [...] "an intense and simultaneous crescendo and glissando." [...] All of the themes take place on a harmonic minor scale. On the track, [...] "Warriors' Truth", Bates used Gerard Marino's main God of War theme and [...] "twists it for the prequel setting", [...] "taking the harmonic ascending scale and reverting it to a downwards pattern with a harsh choir/brass combination." [...] The track [...] "Visions of Ruin" [...] features the cimbalom, which is rarely used in video game soundtracks. She said overall [...] "The music is powerful, rich, and pulsing", though listening to the whole album can seem repetitive.|$|E

Once Dallas became a hit, series creator David Jacobs proceeded to launch a spin-off series titled Knots Landing, which would feature Valene and Gary prominently. The actress had strong input on how they would create her character outline. She recalled, [...] "I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes.
