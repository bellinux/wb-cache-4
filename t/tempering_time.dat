5000|$|Tempering quenched-steel at {{very low}} temperatures, between 66 and 148 C, will usually not have much effect other than a slight relief {{of some of the}} {{internal}} stresses. Tempering at higher temperatures, from 148 to 205 C, will produce a slight reduction in hardness, but will primarily relieve much of the internal stresses. Tempering in the range of 260 and 340 C causes a decrease in ductility and an increase in brittleness, and {{is referred to as the}} [...] "tempered martensite embrittlement" [...] (TME) range. Except in the case of blacksmithing, this range is usually avoided. Steel requiring more strength than toughness, such as tools, are usually not tempered above 205 C. Instead, a variation in hardness is usually produced by varying only the <b>tempering</b> <b>time.</b> When increased toughness is desired at the expense of strength, higher tempering temperatures, from 370 to 540 C, are used. Tempering at even higher temperatures, between 540 and 600 C, will produce excellent toughness, but at a serious reduction in the strength and hardness. At 600 C, the steel may experience another stage of embrittlement, called [...] "temper embrittlement" [...] (TE), which occurs if the steel is held within the TE temperature range for too long. When heating above this temperature, the steel will usually not be held for any amount of time, and quickly cooled to avoid temper embrittlement.|$|E
40|$|The {{manner of}} {{recirculating}} rice dryers which is extensively used in Taiwanis intermittent drying. Intermittent drying {{is composed of}} heating and tampering. A drying cycle includes heating time and <b>tempering</b> <b>time.</b> In a drying cycle, the drying time is used to be fixed and the <b>tempering</b> <b>time</b> changes and signifcantly affects the drying rate and milling quality of rice. this study focus on the effectof <b>tempering</b> <b>time</b> on drying rate and milling quality of rice for recirculating drying. the testing items of quality includethe percentage of brown rice, polished rice, head yield and germination rate. According to the experimental results, the following conclusions are drawnas below: If the <b>tempering</b> <b>time</b> is not included, the heating time is fixed and the <b>tempering</b> <b>time</b> in a cycle increase, the total heating time become longer. It points out extending the <b>tempering</b> <b>time</b> for drying cycle can increase the average drying rate for only the heating period. On the contrary, if the <b>tempering</b> <b>time</b> is counted, the drying rate will decrease {{with the increase of}} the <b>tempering</b> <b>time.</b> When the drying air temperature is above 50 ℃,the percentage of polished rice for intermittent drying is higher than continuous drying. Tempering process benefits the production of polish rice. The drying air temperture influences more on the head yield than the time ratio of heating and tempering. When the drying air temperature is over 50 ℃, head yield drops obviously for both intermittent drying and continuous drying. The percentage of head yield of intermittent drying is always higher than continuous drying. the percentage of head yield decrease with the decrease of the <b>tempering</b> <b>time.</b> When <b>tempering</b> <b>time</b> is less then 70 minites, the percentage of head yield declines significantly. Therefore, in order to prevent the loss of the percentage of head yield, the <b>tempering</b> <b>time</b> in a drying cycle should not be less then 1 / 7. Drying air temperature influence the percentage of germination more then tempering. When the drying air temperature is above 60 ℃, the percentage of germination drops apparently. The percentage of germination for intermittent drying is higher than continuous drying. 國內常用之循環式乾燥機,其乾燥方式為間歇乾燥,而間歇乾燥包括乾燥 時間與均化時間,在乾燥時乾燥時間常為固定,均化時間的長短對稻榖乾燥 速率與品質有相當重要的影響。本研究乃針對在間歇乾燥作業,進行均化 時間對稻榖乾燥速率與品質影響之研究。量測品質項目包括糙米率、白米 率、完整米率與發芽率。乾燥試驗結果如下列所示﹕(1) 就不包括均化時 間而言,當固定熱風乾燥時間,增加每循環期之均化時間,則每循環乾 燥時間變長,亦即增加每循環乾燥時間,可以提高實際的乾燥速率;就包含 均化時間而 言,乾燥速率隨著均化時間的增長而降低。(2) 在本試驗 條件範圍內,當乾燥溫度超過 50 ℃時,白米率有明顯隨溫度下降的趨勢,間 歇 式乾燥之白米率大於連續式乾燥,故均化作用有助白米率的提升 。(3) 在本試驗條件範圍內,乾燥溫度對完整米率的影響較乾燥/均化時間 為大;當乾燥溫度 超過 50 ℃以上,無論間歇式乾燥或連續式乾燥,完整 米率皆有明顯的下降。(4) 間歇式乾燥之完整米率大於連續式乾燥,並且 隨著均化時間的減少而降低,當乾燥/均 化時間小於 10 / 70 時完整米率 有明顯的下降,每循環乾燥期間乾燥時間與均化時間的比 應大於 1 : 7 。(5) 乾燥溫度對發芽率的影響較乾燥/均化時間為大,當乾燥溫度大於 60 ℃時,發芽率明顯的 下降,間歇式乾燥之發芽率較連續式乾燥為高...|$|E

The aim of {{this work}} is to study the effect of austenizing time, {{tempering}} process and <b>tempering</b> <b>time</b> on corrosion rate of austenitic stainless steel in oxalic acid.

40|$|After tempering, with {{recovery}} of hardness, MANET steels present internal strains; these residual strains increase with quenching rate prior to tempering, and they remain after prolonged <b>tempering</b> <b>times.</b> On {{account of their}} persistence, after thermal treatments which lead to low dislocation and sub-boundary densities, the possibility has been considered that the high swelling resistance of MANET is connected with these centres of strain, probably connected with the formation, in ferrite, of Cr-enriched and contiguous Cr-depleted zones which may act as sinks for interstitials. Comparative observations on the internal strain behavior of cold worked 316 L stainless steel appear consistent with this possibility...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research topic is to determine mechanical properties of Alloy EP- 823 {{and to provide a}} mechanistic understanding of its sensitivity to both thermal treatment and performance temperature. EP- 823 is a leading target material for accelerator-driven waste transmutation applications. Overall, the tensile test results of Alloy EP- 823 indicated a general trend of decreasing mechanical performance with an increase in <b>tempering</b> <b>time.</b> An increase in <b>tempering</b> <b>time</b> had a statistically significant inverse relationship with ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength (YS). An increase in <b>tempering</b> <b>time</b> did not {{have a significant effect on}} elongation and reduction in area. Performance temperature effects, however, were more noticeable, trending UTS and YS values downward with increasing temperature. Elongation values experience a slight reduction up to 300 °C then ramped upwards for increasing temperatures. Reduction of area values appeared unaffected by an increase in temperature up to 400 °C but did experience an increase with greater temperatures beyond 400 °C. With increasing temperature the mechanical properties changed gradually and predictably up to 400 °C, but at 500 °C they changed drastically, implying that a critical temperature can be found between 400 °C and 500 °C. This temperature could be important to design integrity. At performance temperatures beyond this critical temperature the material experiences unstable deformation shortly after reaching the yield strength value, exhibiting severely truncated uniform plastic deformation characteristics...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: Samples taken from investigated steel were austenitized at the temperature of 900 ºC and hardened in oil. Austenitizing time was 20 minutes.
