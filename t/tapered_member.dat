40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis, relates mainly to the current method of design of steel portal frame structures. The study {{is divided into two}} major parts, first being the full-scale test on a 24 metre span frame and the second deals with the problems of lateral-torsional buckling in the haunch region of the frame. Detailed accounts of the full-scale testing on the 24 metre span frame and the experimental results are given. Supplementary tests on beams cut out from the tested frame in order to establish the strain-hardening factor are also presented. A literature survey on the published material pertinent to the lateral torsional-buckling of a <b>tapered</b> <b>member</b> was undertaken. Different methods of treatment for the elastic stability of tapered members and any evidence from previous research in this area were reviewed. Details of an appropriate finite element and the corresponding computer programme are given. This section describes the assumptions and the Finite Element formulations adopted in the computer programme. The earlier work on this analysis dealt only with prismatic members and this was extended to solve tapered sections. Therefore, a full calibration of the finite element formulation for a <b>tapered</b> <b>member</b> was carried out. The stability clauses in BS 5950 are introduced systematically. Theoretical work which leads to the formulation of the clauses in Appendix G is also described. These stability clauses were assessed by the analysis of selected prismatic and tapered members using the finite element formulation. From this assessment some modifications to the clauses are proposed. The results of the modified clauses are compared with those given by the finite element analysis and the original clauses. Lastly, the modified clauses are checked with the results of the portal frame tested, to confirm its validity. This study leads to the proposal for some amendments in the clauses in Appendix G and Clause 5. 5. 3. 5. of BS 5950...|$|E

For prismatic and wedge-shaped members, the governing differential equation is integrated in closed form {{by means of}} confluent hypergeometric functions. For general <b>tapered</b> <b>members</b> (0 <(h(max) -h(min)) /h(max) < 1), {{the solution to the}} boundary value problem is obtained {{in the form of a}} Frobenius' series, which is shown to converge in the interior of the domain and at the boundary if and only if 0 <(h(max) -h(min)) /h(max) < 1 / 2. Therefore, for 1 / 2 <=(h(max) -h(min)) /h(max) < 1 the Frobenius' series solution cannot be used to establish the characteristic equation for the cantilever beam-columns; the problem is then solved numerically by means of a collocation procedure. Some of the analytical solutions (buckling loads) were compared with the results of shell finite-element analyses and an excellent agreement was found in all cases, thus validating the mathematical model and confirming the correctness of the analytical results.

40|$|Many of today's {{low-rise}} building structures consist of thin-walled metal members that form Metal Building Frames (MBFs). Members associated with MBFs typically involve tapered webs. Although use of web-tapered members for MBFs {{are driven by}} economical efficiency, understanding on how these type of members respond under seismic loading is limited. Design of web-tapered members generally is governed by lateral-torsional buckling (LTB) and local buckling. To better understand the seismic response of MBFs that buckle, use of numerical methods that can simulate buckling and post-buckling behavior are desirable. Since it is not inefficient to use elements such as shells or solids for extensive seismic analyses, development of a one-dimensional beam-column element is researched and incorporated to the software OpenSees in order to capture warping and non-prismatic effects. In addition to monotonic correlations, six full-scale web- <b>tapered</b> <b>members</b> cyclically tested at UCSD were analyzed using this proposed beam-column element.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to gain from {{experimental}} tests an insight into the failure mode of slender steel columns subjected to fire. The tests will also be used to validate a numerical model. Design/methodology/approach A series of experimental fire tests were conducted on eight full-scale steel columns made of slender I-shaped Class 4 sections. Six columns were made of welded sections (some prismatic and some <b>tapered</b> <b>members),</b> and two columns were made of hot rolled sections. The nominal length of the columns was 2. 7 meters with the whole length being heated. The load was applied at ambient temperature after which the temperature was increased under constant load. The load was applied concentrically on some tests and with an eccentricity in other tests. Heating was applied by electrical resistances enclosed in ceramic pads. Numerical simulations were performed with the software SAFIR® using shell elements. Findings The tests have allowed determining the appropriate method of application of the electrical heating system for obtaining a uniform temperature distribution in the members. Failure of the columns during the tests occurred by combination of local and global buckling. The numerical model reproduced correctly the failure modes as well as the critical temperatures. Originality/value The numerical model that has been validated has been used in subsequent parametric analyses performed to derive design equations to be used in practice. This series of test results can be used by the scientific community to validate their own numerical or analytical models for the fire resistance of slender steel columns. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{stiffness}} reduction {{method for}} the design of laterally restrained web-tapered steel structures fabricated through the welding of individual steel plates is presented in this paper. Stiffness reduction functions for welded members, accounting fully for the deleterious influence of the spread of plasticity and imperfections on the structural resistance, are developed. The method is implemented through (i) dividing <b>tapered</b> <b>members</b> into prismatic segments along their lengths, (ii) reducing the flexural stiffness of each segment by means of the developed stiffness reduction functions considering the first-order forces and cross-section properties of each segment, (iii) performing Geometrically Nonlinear Analysis and (iv) making cross-section strength checks. Essentially, it is proposed to replace the current typical approach to structural design of conducting a simple elastic (with nominal stiffness) structural analysis followed by elaborate member checks with an integrated process utilising more sophisticated second-order analysis (with stiffness reduction) but very simple design checks. The distribution of internal forces within the structure is captured more accurately due to the allowance for imperfections, residual stresses and plasticity through stiffness reduction and the allowance for frame and member instability effects through the use of second-order analysis. The need for determining effective lengths and for conducting member buckling checks is also eliminated. Verification of the proposed approach against the results obtained from nonlinear shell finite element modelling is presented for various tapering geometries, slenderness values and loading conditions. Assessment of the proposed method against the European and North American steel design codes for tapered steel structures is also provided...|$|R

40|$|Certain {{benefits}} {{in terms of}} the efficiency in material consumption can be achieved by adopting <b>tapered</b> steel <b>members</b> in long-span structures. In this paper, analytical solutions for second-order analysis of non-prismatic steel members by a series of tapered beam-column elements are firstly proposed. The exact stiffness matrices for five common types of sections, e. g. circular solid, circular hollow, rectangular solid, rectangular hollow and symmetric I sections, are derived using the Hermite interpolation shape function and the co-rotational (CR) description to simplify the derivations and formulations. Large deformation is considered by the incremental secant stiffness method based on the updated Lagrangian approach. Descriptions for the kinematic motion using the CR description are elaborated. A distinct feature of the proposed method is to analytically express the flexural rigidity of tapered sections in the stiffness matrices using a series of stiffness factors, such as the αi and βi factors, accurately reflecting the stiffness variation along the member length. Several examples are presented to examine the validity and accuracy of the proposed formulations.

40|$|In {{order to}} fill the lack of {{knowledge}} about slender elements behavior at elevated temperatures, a European research project called FIDESC 4 has been funded by the RFCS. This project involves experimental testing, parametric numerical analyses and development of simple design rules. The present paper reports the characteristics and the results of the FIDESC 4 experimental test campaign performed at the University of Liege on slender steel columns at elevated temperatures. A total of eight columns have been tested, all of them with I shape section. Six columns were made of welded sections (some prismatic and some <b>tapered</b> <b>members)</b> and two columns were with hot rolled sections. The nominal length of the columns was 3 meters with the whole length being heated. The strength of the material (webs and flanges) was measured on sample before the tests. The order of magnitude of the initial geometrical imperfections was recorded. The columns were not restrained against longitudinal thermal elongation. The supports at the ends were cylindrical thus inducing a restrain against rotation in one plane while allowing rotation in the other plane. The allowed direction of rotation was chosen in each test to induce buckling around the strong or the weak axis. The load was applied at ambient temperature and maintained for a period of 15 minutes after which the temperature was increased under constant load. The load was applied concentrically on some tests and with an eccentricity in other tests. The load eccentricity was either applied at both ends, leading to constant bending moment distribution along the length, or at one end only, leading to a triangular bending moment distribution. Heating was applied by electrical resistances enclosed in ceramic pads. The columns and the ceramic pads were wrapped in ceramic wool insulating material. This technique was preferred to gas heating in a standard test furnace because it allows applying a slower and better controlled heating rate and thus obtaining a more uniform temperature distribution in the member. It is also easier to measured lateral displacements of the column. Preliminary blank tests were performed on unloaded specimen {{in order to determine the}} heating range to be used later on the loaded columns. The paper will also report on a modification of the heating technique that was applied and improved significantly the uniformity in the temperature distribution. Numerical simulations were performed before the tests using shell elements of the software SAFIR and assumed values of the material properties in order to predict the failure modes. It was essentially crucial to determine whether lateral supports at intermediate levels should be provided in order to ensure failure in the desired direction. Experience showed that the failure modes developed as predicted by the numerical simulations. Besides a thorough description of the experiments, the paper will also present the obtained results in terms of failure mode, ultimate temperature and evolution of longitudinal and transverse displacement. Some information will also be given about the level of detail that has to be used in the numerical model in order to get accurate results at a reasonable price. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A newly {{developed}} theory {{for the analysis}} of tapered sandwich panels with laminated anisotropic facings is presented. Unlike sandwich panels of uniform depth, the response of tapered sandwich panels is counterintuitive. For example, prior studies have demonstrated that a tapered cantilever sandwich beam having constant dimensions at the clamped edge and subjected to a tip load has an optimum taper angle where the tip deflection is a minimum. The decrease in tip deflection with increasing taper angle, despite the reduction in core thickness, is due to the participation of the facings in resisting transverse shear loads. In the present work, we systematically develop a tapered sandwich theory that is simple to use, yet accurately predicts the stresses and deflection of both symmetric and nonsymmetric tapered sections. A novel feature of the analytical model is that the elastic rigidities of tapered sandwich composites are expressed in terms of the familiar A, B, and D matrices that are widely used to analyze the response of laminated plates and sandwich beams of uniform depth. It is shown that the stiffness matrix for a <b>tapered</b> sandwich <b>member</b> exhibits a total of 12 elastic couplings that are absent in sandwich beams of uniform depth. The analytical model predicts large interlaminar shear and normal stresses near the root of the tapered sandwich beam, which can cause delamination failure between the facings and the core. Numerical results obtained using the tapered sandwich theory and two-dimensional finite element models are in good agreement for several case studies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a {{numerical}} method is presented {{for the free}} vibration and stability analyses of tapered thinwalled beams with arbitrary open cross sections. The proposed method takes the flexural-torsional coupling effect of tapered thin-walled beams with arbitrary open cross sections into account. The total potential energy is derived for an elastic behavior from the strain energy, the kinetic energy and work of the loads applied on the cross section contour. Free vibration is considered {{in the presence of}} harmonic excitations. The effects of the initial stresses and load eccentricities are also considered in stability analysis. The governing equilibrium equations, motion equations and the associated boundary conditions are derived from the stationary condition. As in the presence of tapering, stiffness quantities are not constant; therefore, the power series approximation is used to solve the fourth-order differential equations. Displacement components and cross-section properties are expanded in terms of power series of a known degree. Then, the shape functions are obtained by deriving the deformation shape of <b>tapered</b> thin-walled <b>member</b> as power series form. Finally, stiffness and mass matrices are carried out by means of the principle of virtual work along the member's axis. In order to measure the accuracy and check the validity of this method, the natural frequencies and buckling loads of non-prismatic thin-walled beams with web and flange tapering and various boundary conditions are obtained and compared to the results of finite element analysis using Ansys software and those of other available numerical and analytical ones.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{highlight}} promising methods in current thin metallic shell design practice and to define a future needs framework from which research can launch. Thin shell structural members are a staple in many industries – from aerospace, ship building, to offshore oil and gas to residential and commercial buildings.

For optimized member design providing maximum strength and stiffness at minimum cost, general non-prismatic (tapered and/or stepped cross-sections) as well as singly-symmetric cross-sections have been commonly employed. Fabricators equipped to produce web-tapered members can create a wide range of optimized members from a minimal stock of different plates and coil. Linearly tapered web plates can be nested to minimize scrap. In many cases, the savings in material and manufacturing efficiencies lead to significant cost savings relative to the use of comparable rolled shapes. To employ Design Guide 25 (DG 25) which provides guidance for the application of the provisions of the AISC Specification to the design of frames composed of general non-prismatic members, designers need a robust and general capability for determining the elastic buckling loads. Furthermore, robust tools are needed to facilitate the selection of optimum non-prismatic member designs based on minimum cost. 	This research addresses the calculation of the elastic buckling loads for general non-prismatic members subjected to general loadings and bracing conditions (typically involving multiple brace points along a given member). This research develops an elastic buckling analysis tool (SABRE 2) {{that can be used to}} define general geometries, loadings and bracing conditions and obtain a rigorous calculation of the elastic buckling load levels. The three-dimensional finite element equations using open section thin-walled beam theory are derived and formulated using a co-rotational approach including load height effects of transverse loads, stepped flange dimensions, and bracing and support height effects. In addition, this research addresses an algorithmic means to obtain automatic optimized member and frame designs using the above types of members based on Genetic Algorithms (GA). These capabilities are implemented in the tool SABRE 2 D, which provides a graphical user interface for optimized member and frame design based on updated DG 25 provisions and the elastic buckling load calculations from SABRE 2.

50|$|Internally, the {{building}} has an entrance foyer with terrazzo floor at the southeast. The foyer has planter boxes to the southeast windows with polished granite facings and cappings, and marble cladding to the window reveals. The foyer is split-level, with steps leading to a raised lift foyer, with a central lift around which a terrazzo stair is located. The lift core has circular openings with metal grilles, giving a port-hole effect, and each floor has a terrazzo finished lift foyer. The penthouse plantroom is accessed via a narrow timber stair from the lift foyer below. The Bolsover Street wing is planned to have a central corridor, which is delineated by a row of columns to either side, with partitions dividing the office space. The central corridor has a lower ceiling housing a ventilation system with registers to the adjacent office space. Sections of the original partitioning system survive, with tracks for the location of partitions evident in the ceilings and walls. Toilets, stores and service rooms are located at the northwest end of {{the building}}, and have terrazzo floors and ceramic tiled walls. A second terrazzo dog-leg stair is located fronting Fitzroy Street at the northern corner of the building, with an entrance foyer with terrazzo floor. This stair has a sculptural balustrade consisting of <b>tapered</b> metal vertical <b>members,</b> shaped timber handrail, and solid vertical panels.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} antipsychotic medication use in residents {{of nursing homes}} (NH) {{in the absence of}} psychiatric diagnoses is concerning. To address these concerns, it is essential to explore how these medications are being prescribed and managed in the NH setting. Our objectives were to understand the decision-making process that influences prescribing and factors that trigger administration of antipsychotic medications to residents with dementia in NHs and to explore why residents remain on antipsychotic medications {{over an extended period of}} time. Methods: Interviews with prescribers, caregivers, and family members, on-site observations in study facilities, and review of NH resident medical records. Facilities were selected to obtain a diverse sample of NHs. Results: 204 NH residents with dementia in 26 facilities distributed across five selected Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services regions were included. Problematic behaviors were the dominant reasons offered as influencing prescribing of antipsychotic medications. Providers indicated that they chose an antipsychotic, rather than another drug class, because they believed that antipsychotic medications were more likely to be effective. There was no standard approach to <b>taper</b> attempts. Family <b>members</b> identified a lack of communication as a barrier to their involvement in decision-making. Conclusions: There is widespread perception that antipsychotic medications are effective and beneficial in managing problematic behaviors in NH residents with dementia. Little attention is given to planning for antipsychotic tapering or discontinuation. There may be opportunities to involve family members more fully in decision-making around the use of antipsychotic medications...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} Phase Two of a SHEFC funded project jointly {{carried out by}} the Department of Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering, University of Paisley, the Mackintosh School of Architecture, and Lamp Software. The project aims to build a {{computer-assisted}} learning package on the response of structures to load. The software will be used as an interactive teaching tool for both architectural and engineering students.  The package has four levels: Beginners (Level 1), Intermediate (Level 2) and Advanced (Levels 3 and 4). The first two levels have been completed after continuous feedback from both institutions. Level 1 is geared towards architectural and engineering students to help them understand structural behaviour of building components, such as deflection. Level 2 is a graphical editor that enables students to draw precisely the structure of their designs, investigate the deflection of structural members and identify areas of tension and compression. Levels 3 and 4 are a design tool which is aimed at architectural and civil engineering students where they can design and analyse realistic structures by choosing structural members from a library, and specify materials and multiple loads.   Phase One of DEFLECT was presented in the 14 th ECAADE conference, which was held at the University of Lund, Sweden. In Phase Two, the range of structural examples was expanded to include typological classics. This was accompanied by additional teaching and learning material. The package was enlarged to include bending moment and shear force diagrams, <b>tapered</b> and curved <b>members,</b> and additional materials such as glass...|$|R
