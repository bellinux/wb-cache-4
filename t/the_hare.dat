5|$|Hare {{coursing}} is {{the pursuit}} of hares with greyhounds and other sighthounds, which chase <b>the</b> <b>hare</b> by sight and not by scent.|$|E
5|$|Instead {{of being}} coursed on open land, the Irish form is {{run in a}} secure {{enclosure}} over a set distance. Since 1993, Irish Coursing Club rules have made it compulsory for the greyhounds to be muzzled while they chase <b>the</b> <b>hare.</b> After the coursing event, the hares are transported {{back to where they}} were netted and re-released into the wild. Whereas the UK form of coursing was run with dogs winning points for their running and turning of <b>the</b> <b>hare,</b> the Republic of Ireland form is run on the basis that the first dog to turn <b>the</b> <b>hare</b> wins. This is denoted by either a red flag or a white flag, indicating the colours of the respective dogs' collars.|$|E
5|$|The chased hare {{will then}} run at around 40–45km/h (24–26mph) {{and the course}} will last around 35–40seconds over 0.5km (0.3 miles). The greyhounds which pursue <b>the</b> <b>hare</b> will, being faster, start {{to catch up with}} it. As greyhounds are much larger than hares but less agile, they find it {{difficult}} to follow the hares' sharp turns which they make to evade the dogs. This agility gives <b>the</b> <b>hare</b> an important and often crucial advantage as it seeks to escape. Under some coursing club rules, the dogs are awarded points on how many times they can turn <b>the</b> <b>hare,</b> and how closely they force the hare's progress. In the UK, the contest between the greyhounds was usually judged from horseback, and the winning greyhound proceeded to the next round of a knock-out tournament. The 2003 UK coursing season ran from 1 October to 28 February.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Korean <b>hare</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Thomas in 1892. Apart from the it, five {{other species of}} <b>hare</b> in <b>the</b> genus Lepus occur in eastern Asia, <b>the</b> Chinese <b>hare</b> (L. sinensis), <b>the</b> mountain <b>hare</b> (L. timidus), <b>the</b> Manchurian <b>hare</b> (L. mandschuricus), <b>the</b> Japanese <b>hare</b> (L. brachyurus) and <b>the</b> brown <b>hare</b> (L. capensis). In 1974, <b>the</b> Korean <b>hare</b> {{was considered to be}} a subspecies of L. brachyurus and in 1978, a sub-species of L. sinensis, however, study of mtDNA has now shown that <b>the</b> Korean <b>hare</b> is indeed a valid species, L coreanus.|$|R

5|$|Greyhounds were {{introduced}} in the Americas for sport and pleasure, they helped farmers control jackrabbits, and organised coursing meets were {{taking place in the}} United States in the 19th century, by 1886 according to Gulf Coast Greyhounds. Open field coursing of jackrabbits, which are members of <b>the</b> <b>hare</b> family, now takes place {{in a number of states}} in Western America, including California, Montana and Wyoming, and is said by the North American Coursing Association to take place also in Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah. It takes place with up to four dogs chasing <b>the</b> <b>hare.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beagles were {{developed}} primarily for hunting hare, an activity known as beagling. They {{were seen as}} ideal hunting companions for the elderly who could follow on horseback without exerting themselves, for young hunters who could keep up with them on ponies, and for the poorer hunters who {{could not afford to}} maintain a stable of good hunting horses. Before the advent of the fashion for foxhunting in the 19th century, hunting was an all day event where the enjoyment was derived from the chase rather than the kill. In this setting the tiny beagle was well matched to <b>the</b> <b>hare,</b> as unlike Harriers they would not quickly finish the hunt, but because of their excellent scent-tracking skills and stamina they were almost guaranteed to eventually catch <b>the</b> <b>hare.</b> The beagle packs would run closely together ("so close that they might be covered with a sheet") which was useful in a long hunt, as it prevented stray dogs from obscuring the trail. In thick undergrowth they were also preferred to spaniels when hunting pheasant.|$|E

5|$|In the 16th century, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu of Bengal {{established}} the Bhakti movements of India, now {{known by the}} name <b>the</b> <b>Hare</b> Krishna movement. He spent many years as a devotee of Jagannatha at Puri; {{he is said to}} have merged with the deity. There is also a matha of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu here known as Radhakanta Math.|$|E
5|$|Since the Mantra-Rock Dance brought <b>the</b> <b>Hare</b> Krishna {{movement}} to the wider attention of the American public, Prabhupada's increased popularity attracted {{the interest of the}} mainstream media. Most notably, he was interviewed on ABC's The Les Crane Show and lectured on the philosophy of Krishna consciousness on a KPFK radio station program hosted by Peter Bergman. Prabhupada's followers also spoke about their activities on the San Francisco radio station KFRC.|$|E
5|$|To achieve {{proportional}} representation, {{seat allocation}} was conducted using the largest remainder method, whereby <b>the</b> <b>Hare</b> quota {{was used to}} determine seats automatically secured by individual parties.

40|$|Stress {{may be an}} {{important}} variable affecting the survival of <b>the</b> captured <b>hares,</b> for this reason the Authors studied the effect of the use of a blindfolding hood applied to <b>the</b> <b>hares</b> immediately after net trapping. A total of 119 hares were captured by coursing with 3 - 4 dogs (greyhounds or lurchers) in no hunting areas of Tuscany. Immediately after net trapping 38 hares were blindfolded with a hood and 81 were normally handled to the wooden darkened capture- boxes without blinding their eyes (control). From all <b>the</b> <b>hares</b> a sample of blood was collected within 1 - 2 min by the auricular vein. Blood samples were analyzed for haemocromocytometry and metabolic profile determination. Data were analyzed by ANOVA. Sub-clinically stressed hares were discriminated from nonstressed <b>hares</b> by <b>the</b> use of the discriminant function based on CK, AST and glucose and the differences were tested by  chi 2 c Results showed that body temperature, heart and respiratory rates, glucose, cholesterol, CK, AST, ALT, BUN, total protein and some haemocromo-cytometric parameters were significantly higher in captured <b>hares</b> without blindfold. <b>The</b> incidence of subclinically stressed hares was 26 % in <b>the</b> <b>hares</b> equipped with <b>the</b> blindfold and 81 % in <b>the</b> <b>hares</b> without blindfold (chi 2 c = 32. 98, P< 0. 0001) (presence of subclinical stress discriminated by the use of a discriminant function based on CPK, AST and glucose). For this reason the procedures designed for the translocation of <b>the</b> <b>hares</b> could take advantage by the use of a blindfold which should be applied to <b>the</b> <b>hares</b> immediately after their trapping...|$|R

5|$|In 2004, Harrison was posthumously {{inducted}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist by his former bandmates Lynne and Petty, and into the Madison Square Garden Walk of Fame in 2006 for the Concert for Bangladesh. On 14 April 2009, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded Harrison a star on the Walk of Fame {{in front of the}} Capitol Records Building. McCartney, Lynne and Petty were present when the star was unveiled. Harrison's widow Olivia, the actor Tom Hanks and Idle made speeches at the ceremony, and Harrison's son Dhani spoke <b>the</b> <b>Hare</b> Krishna mantra.|$|E
5|$|In Greek Mythology, Canis Major {{represented}} the dog Laelaps, {{a gift from}} Zeus to Europa; or sometimes the hound of Procris, Diana's nymph; or the one given by Aurora to Cephalus, so famed for its speed that Zeus elevated it to the sky. It was also considered to represent one of Orion's hunting dogs, pursuing Lepus <b>the</b> <b>Hare</b> or helping Orion fight Taurus the Bull; and is referred to in this way by Aratos, Homer and Hesiod. The ancient Greeks refer only to one dog, but by Roman times, Canis Minor appears as Orion's second dog. Alternative names include Canis Sequens and Canis Alter. Canis Syrius was the name used in the 1521 Alfonsine tables.|$|E
5|$|Modern hare {{coursing}} is practiced using {{a number of}} sighthounds: mainly greyhounds but also Borzois, Salukis, Whippets, and Deerhounds that are registered with a governing body such as the National Coursing Club or Kennel Club in Great Britain, the Irish Coursing Club, or the National Open Field Coursing Association (NOFCA) in the US. Events are conducted through local coursing clubs which are regulated by their governing body. The objective of legal formal coursing is to test and judge the athletic ability of the dogs rather than to kill <b>the</b> <b>hare.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the {{resolution}} of all disputes, sixteen parties received at least one seat in the People's Representative Council, while eight received none. The inconsistency {{in the order of}} parties according to votes received and seats allocated arose due to a special rule created to address uneven population distribution between Java and other islands. This rule stipulates that <b>the</b> <b>Hare</b> quota values for the provinces in Java were on average higher than those for the outer islands. A party require fewer votes to automatically secure a seat outside of Java. For example, the National Awakening Party (PKB) received more votes than the National Mandate Party (PAN) but received nearly the same amount of seats. More than half of PKB seats were received in the party's stronghold of East Java, where the quota value was higher. In contrast, only four of PAN seats were automatically secured.|$|E
5|$|Henry Hare (1635–1708) {{settled at}} the Lordship House, {{renaming}} it Bruce Castle {{in honour of}} the area's historic connection with the House of Bruce. Hare was a noted historian {{and author of the}} first history of Tottenham. He grew up at <b>the</b> <b>Hare</b> family house at Totteridge, and it is not known when he moved to Tottenham. At the time of the birth of his first child, Hugh, in 1668, the family were still living in Totteridge, while {{by the time of the}} death of his first wife Constantia, in 1680, the family were living in Bruce Castle. According to Hare, Constantia was buried in All Hallows Church in Tottenham. However, the parish register for the period is complete and makes no mention of her death or burial.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} originated {{during a}} period marked by Harrison's devotion to a Hindu-aligned ascetic life and {{the height of his}} public association with <b>the</b> <b>Hare</b> Krishna movement, which included his donation of Bhaktivedanta Manor for use as an ISKCON temple. In his lyrics, Harrison sings of the falsehood of striving for wealth or power in the material world and advocates a direct relationship with one's deity as a genuine life goal. In doing so, he belittles the role of political leaders, as well as his own status as a celebrated rock musician. The song's Krishna Conscious message was also reflected in Harrison's choice of artwork for the Material World album, specifically the reproduction of a painting from a Prabhupada-published edition of the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
5|$|The {{first trial}} show {{took place in}} November 2010 in Studio HQ2.

BBC employees started transferring to the development in May 2011, a process that took 36 weeks. BBC Director General Mark Thompson confirmed that up to a further 1,000 jobs could be created or transferred to the site. In January 2012 the BBC was accused of not supporting the community by MP, Hazel Blears, after it was reported that only 26 of 680 jobs created at the development had gone to residents of Salford.|$|E
5|$|According to the UK Government review, the Burns Inquiry (published in 2000), hare {{coursing}} {{was taking place}} in Pakistan, Portugal and Spain. Pakistan has officially prohibited the use of dogs or hawks for coursing unless a special licence is issued for carrying out such activity although, according to some reports, {{hare coursing}} is still practised and popular. Hare coursing in Portugal is run in both forms: open (Prova de Galgos a Campo), and closed (park) coursing where it is known as lebre a corricão. Hare coursing in Portugal may only be legally undertaken with two dogs and operates under the same ethos as coursing in the United States. In Spain, <b>the</b> <b>hare</b> coursing is open coursing, and the areas where the activity takes place includes the Medinrua area. Coursing has long been undertaken in Spain, where Spanish galgos rather than greyhounds are used. These dogs have a precarious life after their coursing careers, with World Animal Protection suggesting that many tens of thousands die cruelly each year. Hare coursing also takes place in Russia but is illegal in most European countries and in Australia, where it {{had a long history}} from 1867 until it was banned in 1985 following a long decline in popularity.|$|E
