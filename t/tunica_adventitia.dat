40|$|We used two-photon laser {{scanning}} microscopy (TPLSM) to demonstrate {{for the first time}} its potential in studying relational details at the cellular level of atherogenesis in intact, viable mouse carotid arteries. Isolated and mounted arteries of ApoE-/-mice, aged 15 or 21 weeks (7 and 13 weeks on western diet), were imaged after labeling with specific fluorescent markers for cell nuclei, inflammatory cells, collagen, and lipids. Data were compared with C 57 BL 6 /J mice fed a chow diet. Control vessels had intact endothelium without adhering blood cells or significant intimal collagen labeling. In ApoE-/-mice already at 15 weeks, inflammatory cells adhered to the endothelium and increased labeling of collagen was observed in tunica intima at both lesion-prone and non-lesion-prone sites, indicating endothelium activation. In plaques, internalized inflammatory cell density increased with age and plaque progression in <b>tunicae</b> <b>adventitia</b> and intima, but not media. In the whole plaque, aging or plaque progression did not alter the direct relationship between inflammatory cells and collagen. However, within the fibrous caps specifically, direct contact between inflammatory cells and collagen increased with age.

40|$|To {{explore the}} {{hypothesis}} that air pollution promotes cardiovascular changes, Swiss mice were continuously exposed, since birth, in two open-top chambers (filtered and nonfiltered for airborne particles <= 0. 3 mu m) placed 20 m from a street with heavy traffic in downtown Sao Paulo, twenty-four hours per day for four months. Fine particle (PM(2. 5)) concentration was determined gravimetrically; hearts were analyzed by morphometry. There was a reduction of the PM(2. 5) inside the filtered chamber (filtered = 8. 61 +/- 0. 79 mu g/m(3), nonfiltered = 18. 05 +/- 1. 25 mu g/m(3), p <. 001). Coronary arteries showed no evidence of luminal narrowing in the exposed group but presented higher collagen content in the adventitia of LV large-sized and RV midsized vessels (p =. 001) and elastic fibers in both <b>tunicae</b> <b>adventitia</b> and intima-media of almost all sized arterioles from both ventricles (p =. 03 and p =. 001, respectively). We concluded that chronic exposure to urban air since birth induces mild but significant vascular structural alterations in normal individuals, presented as coronary arteriolar fibrosis and elastosis.

40|$|Atherosclerosis {{has been}} {{identified}} as a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial vessel wall. Accumulating evidence indicates that different cells from the <b>tunica</b> intima, media, <b>adventitia,</b> and perivascular adipose tissue not only comprise the intact and normal arterial vessel wall but also participate all in the inflammatory response of atherosclerosis via multiple intricate pathways. For instance, endothelial dysfunction has historically been considered to be the initiator of the development of atherosclerosis. The migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells also play a pivotal role in the progression of atherosclerosis. Additionally, the fibroblasts from the adventitia and adipocytes from perivascular adipose tissue have received considerable attention given their special functions that contribute to atherosclerosis. In addition, numerous types of cytokines produced by different cells from the arterial vessel wall, including endothelium-derived relaxing factors, endothelium-derived contracting factors, tumor necrosis factors, interleukin, adhesion molecules, interferon, and adventitium-derived relaxing factors, have been implicated in atherosclerosis. Herein, we summarize the possible roles of different cells from the entire arterial vessel wall in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis...|$|R
40|$|Fish have a {{secondary}} vessel system which {{emerges from the}} primary vasculature via large numbers of coiled origins. The precise role of this vessel system is unknown. Vascular casting techniques and scanning electron microscopy reveal that the secondary vessels of the blue catfish, Arius graeffei, originate from dorsal, lateral, and ventral segmental primary arteries and from the caudal dorsal aorta. These vessels anastomose {{with each other to}} form larger secondary arteries which parallel the primary vessels for their entire length. Secondary vessels do not appear to form a capillary bed in the skin in A. graeffei as they do in some fish species. Coiled secondary vessel origins are abundant within the <b>tunica</b> media and <b>adventitia</b> of the primary vessels from which they emerge. The origins of the secondary vessels are surrounded by the extensive cytoplasmic processes of specialized endothelial cells. These processes extend for up to 6 mu m into the lumen of the primary vessel. Ultrastructurally the coiled secondary capillaries consist of an endothelial cell tube which is surrounded by a single layer of pericytes. These endothelial cells extend large numbers of microvilli into the lumen of the coiled secondary capillary. Nerve terminals are commonly associated with the coiled secondary capillaries. Immunohistochemistry has revealed the presence of tyrosine-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in catecholamine synthesis in nerve varicosities close to secondary vessels in A. graeffei. This vessel system could therefore be regulated by adrenergic nerves. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

40|$|The {{immunosuppressive}} drug Cyclosporine A (CsA) {{has been successfully}} used in several diseases with immunological basis and in transplant patients. However, the therapeutic treatment induces several side effects, which include the development of severe hypertension, renal failure and cardiotoxicity {{in the majority of}} the patients. Since the mechanism by which CsA induces hypertension is not well defined, the aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the morphological changes and the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in the thoracic aorta of CsA-treated rats. The study was carried out on 40 male Wistar rats with an average weight of 200 – 250 g. The animals were divided into four groups. Groups I and II were injected subcutaneously (sc) daily with castor oil for 15 or 30 days and used as control; group III and IV were injected sc daily with CsA (15 mg/Kg/day) for 15 or 30 days. After the end of the treatment, the thoracic aortae were removed and treated for morphological (Sirius Red) and immunohistochemical evaluation (HSP 25, aB-crystallin and HSP 47). The results indicate that CsA induces (1) timedependent vascular damage visible as fibrosis mainly in intima-media tunica of aorta, and (2) a clear increase in HSP expression. In fact, after 30 days of treatment, HSP and aB-crystallin are increased in all tunicas, whereas HSP 47 only in <b>tunica</b> media and <b>adventitia.</b> These findings could suggest that these proteins are up-regulated after CsA treatment in order to play a defensive role in vascular damage...|$|R
40|$|Focal accumulations of {{mononuclear}} {{cells in}} the arterial wall of healthy humans at predilection sites for atherosclerotic lesions {{have been described as}} ‘vascular-associated lymphoid tissue’ (VALT). Here we investigated whether pigs (Sus scrofa), a commonly used animal model for studying cardiovascular disease, have VALT. Samples of major arteries were collected from 10 conventional crossbred pigs (age, 2 to 24 mo) and processed for routine light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. Single or small aggregates of mononuclear cells were noted in the intima and occasionally the inner portion of the <b>tunica</b> media and <b>adventitia</b> at branching sites. The infiltrating cells were primarily CD 3 +CD 4 + T cells, with some macrophages. No CD 8 + T cells were present. Infiltrating leukocytes and overlying endothelial cells frequently expressed major histocompatibility class II molecules. Two Ossabaw pigs on low-fat diet had similar leukocytic aggregates at locations where animals of the same breed but fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet developed atherosclerotic lesions. Further, the densities of CD 3 + T lymphocytes and in these areas were decreased in 2 sedentary and 2 exercised Ossabaw pigs on an atherogenic diet compared with conventional crossbred and Ossabaw pigs on a normal diet. This study shows that focal aggregates of lymphocytes occur in the vasculature of pigs at locations predisposed to development of atherosclerotic lesions. These cellular aggregates are similar to the structures described as VALT in human arteries and reinforce the value of the pig {{as a model for the}} study of human cardiovascular disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{ophthalmic}} artery has an anomalous {{origin in}} 2 - 3 % of cases and rarely {{arises from the}} anterior cerebral artery. Herein, we provide the first anatomical, radiological, and histological description of such an anomalous origin, together with a literature review. During the anatomical dissection of an 81 -year-old Caucasian male, {{the absence of the}} right ophthalmic artery in its usual location was evident from an endonasal transsphenoidal perspective. The specimen was then studied in detail, through multiple dissections, corrosion casting, high-resolution CT, and histological analysis. The English literature on anomalous origins of the ophthalmic artery was reviewed, together with reported associated pathologies. Anatomo-radiological analysis documented that the right ophthalmic artery arose from the inferior surface of A 1 tract of the anterior cerebral artery (A 1) and passed over the optic nerve in its subarachnoid tract. A meningo-ophthalmic artery was evident on the same side and reached the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. Histological examination of both internal carotid artery (ICA) walls documented a significantly decreased thickness of the <b>tunica</b> media and <b>adventitia</b> {{on the side of the}} anomalous ophthalmic artery, with a significantly different content of collagen types I and III. The literature review documented an association of aneurysms and anomalous ophthalmic arteries.

40|$|The genes coding for {{the core}} {{proteins}} {{of the small}} chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate proteoglycans (PGs) biglycan and decorin are both expressed in the adult human testis. Northern hybridization of human testicular mRNA indicated the presence of one specific transcript for biglycan at 2. 6 kb and two specific transcripts for decorin at 1. 6 kb and 1. 9 kb. In situ hybridization localized the mRNA for biglycan to the peritubular tissue {{as well as to}} the <b>tunica</b> muscularis and <b>adventitia</b> of arteries. Leydig cells and cells of the seminiferous epithelium both proved to be negative. For decorin mRNA, strong signals were found over single, dispersed interstitial cells (possibly fibroblasts), the adventitious layer of large arteries, and the perivascular tissue cells of small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. In the peritubular cell layers, decorin gene expression was comparably lower and was restricted to the outer fibroblast layers. Germ cells and Sertoli cells were devoid of any positive signal. Immunoblot analysis using specific antisera directed against the core proteins of biglycan and decorin confirmed their presence in chondroitin ABC lyase-treated proteinaceous extracts of the human testis. Immunohistochemistry for biglycan showed a good spatial correlation with the in situ hybridization data and revealed in addition a nonuniform distribution of the antigenic material, which was located predominantly over peritubular myoid cells and the adventitious layer of arteries. Together these results indicate that the expres-sion of both genes in the human testis is differentially regulated, despite the overall similarity of their protein products, and suggest distinct roles for these PGs in testicular function...|$|R
40|$|The ideal {{prosthesis}} {{to replace}} the diseased human aortic valve is not yet available. We have previously shown that porcine acellular aortic-valve conduits, obtained by detergent-enzymatic method, display hemodynamic performances {{similar to those of}} their native counterparts. Hence, it seemed worthwhile to ascertain whether these tissue-engineered prostheses can be successfully xenotransplanted. Porcine acellular conduits, which immunocytochemistry demonstrated to lack MHC class I and II antigens, were implanted in the thoracic aorta of 9 sheep. Two animals died just after surgery, and the other 7 sheep were sacrificed 1 or 5 months after transplantation. A rather favorable outcome of the implant was observed in 4 sheep. In these animals, aortic valves remained pliable and coaptive, and the luminal surface of the conduits was endothelized just after one month from surgery. An intense inflammatory response was present at 1 month, and, although attennuated, it persisted for 5 months, located mainly between the tunica intima and media and at the border of the implant. Vimentin-positive and smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts proliferated within <b>tunica</b> media and <b>adventitia,</b> and an obvious thickening of the tunica intima was also observed. Small vessels were seen in the adventitia, and elastic fibers were well-preserved in both the aorta wall and valve leaflets. In the cases of unfavorable outcome (3 of 7 survived sheep), implants were detached from the aorta recipient and surrounded by a connective mass that almost completely obstructed their lumen. These masses were composed of a fibromyxoid background where proliferating cells, resembling those occurring in human reactive myofibroblastic lesions (proliferative fascitis), were embedded. Collectively, these rather disappointing findings indicate that acellular valve conduits, obtained by the detergent-enzymatic method, are presently not suitable for clinical applications because of the persistent inflammatory response, which conceivably triggers overgrowth mechanisms that lead to implant failure...|$|R

50|$|Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) {{are more}} common than their {{thoracic}} counterpart. One {{reason for this is}} that elastin, the principal load-bearing protein present in the wall of the aorta, is reduced in the abdominal aorta as compared to the thoracic aorta. Another is that the abdominal aorta does not possess vasa vasorum, the nutrient-supplying blood vessels within the wall of the aorta. Most AAA are true aneurysms that involve all three layers (tunica intima, tunica media and <b>tunica</b> <b>adventitia).</b> The prevalence of AAAs increases with age, with an average age of 65-70 at the time of diagnosis. AAAs have been attributed to atherosclerosis, though other factors are involved in their formation.|$|E
50|$|Vasa vasorum {{are more}} {{frequent}} in veins than arteries. Some authorities hypothesize that the vasa vasorum {{would be more}} abundant in large veins, as partial oxygen pressure and osmotic pressure is lower in veins.

The converse argument is that generally artery walls are thicker and more muscular than veins as the blood passing through is of a higher pressure.

[...] Also, in describing the external coat or <b>tunica</b> <b>adventitia</b> of an artery, Gray says: [...] "...consists mainly of fine and closely felted bundles of white connective tissue..." [...] In such classes of connective tissue the felted structure is very important; it is versatile in resisting tearing by distributing localised stresses and it imparts strength together with shock absorption and elasticity {{in two or three}} dimensions at once, irrespective of the shape of the tissue.

50|$|Arterial baroreceptors are stretch receptors {{that are}} stimulated by {{distortion}} of the arterial wall when pressure changes. The baroreceptors can identify the changes in both the average blood pressure or {{the rate of change}} in pressure with each arterial pulse. Action potentials triggered in the baroreceptor ending are then directly conducted to the brainstem where central terminations (synapses) transmit this information to neurons within the solitary nucleus. Reflex responses from such baroreceptor activity can trigger increases or decreases in the heart rate. Arterial baroreceptor sensory endings are simple, splayed nerve endings that lie in the <b>tunica</b> <b>adventitia</b> of the artery. An increase in the mean arterial pressure increases depolarization of these sensory endings, which results in action potentials. These action potentials are conducted to the solitary nucleus in the central nervous system by axons and have a reflex effect on the cardiovascular system through autonomic neurons. Hormone secretions that target the heart and blood vessels are affected by the stimulation of baroreceptors.|$|E

This study aimed at describing the features of atherosclerosis in the <b>tunica</b> <b>adventitia</b> {{of two of the}} commonly afflicted arteries, namely, left anterior descending coronary and common carotid in black Kenyans. Materials and Methods. Specimens from 108 individuals [76 males and 32 females, mean age 34. 6] were processed for paraffin embedding. Seven micron thick sections were stained with Mason’s trichrome and Haematoxylin/Eosin and examined with a light microscope. Results. Features of atherosclerosis were present in the <b>tunica</b> <b>adventitia</b> of 14. 8 % of left anterior descending arteries and 11. 1 % of common carotid arteries. Increase in adventitial thickness was associated with increased density of vasa vasora in 8. 3 % of both arteries.

With some of the above specimens transparent samples were also prepared. By the forced reverse flow of lymph {{it was found that the}} excretory lymph vessel group arising from lymph capillary immediately adjacent to the internal elastic membrane of the aortic wall runs gradually along collagenous fibers through the fenestrations of each elastic membrane of the tunica media, and appears at the <b>tunica</b> <b>adventitia</b> and after confluencing they become a ralatively large excretory lymph vessel, but they further confluence with the excretory lymph vessel arising from the lymph capillary of fat tissue in the <b>tunica</b> <b>adventitia,</b> and they form an aggregative lymph vessel which runs over the exterior layer of the <b>tunica</b> <b>adventitia,</b> and when it comes out of the <b>tunica</b> <b>adventitia</b> it enters into the aortic lymph node.
