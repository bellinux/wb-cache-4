By using the glass device and the voltage stabilized source of direct current, decolorization ratios higher than 78 % were observed {{during a period of}} 5 h. Comparing this value with the sum of the decolorization ratios obtained by a sole application of electrochemical (lower than 3 %) and photochemical (about 23 %) procedures, a significant synergic effect between both processes was observed.

The simulation results are presented in the form of comparisons with the experimental data for the time-averaged gas holdup and the instantaneous and time-averaged air and liquid velocity fields. Overall, the qualitative and quantitative comparisons between experiments and simulations are satisfactory for both uniform and nonuniform aeration.

Materials and Methods: Data obtained using a laboratory pilot in accordance with <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>aeration,</b> temperature and pH and the concentration of the feed inlet to the Ekbatan wastewater treatment plantin Tehran. Changes in microbial growth by measuring MLVSS and COD changes of input substrate in the range of 50 - 500 mg/L was investigated. Results: The results of the ASM 1 model for kinetic coefficients of Ks were determined as 31. 2 gCOD. m- 3, µH as 3. 9 day- 1, bH as 0. 077 day- 1 and YH as 0. 51 gCOD XH (gCOD SS) - 1. The difference between ASM 1 and Common equations in activated sludge processes was 7. 6 %, 9. 2 %, 9. 4 % and 6. 9 % for Ks, µH, bH and YH, respectively.

40|$|When Neurospora {{mycelium}} {{is transferred}} from a medium containing sucrose to one containing acetate as sole source of carbon, a preferential synthesis of many Krebs cycle, glyoxylate cycle, and associated enzymes occurs. Respiration was inhibited during preferential enzyme synthesis in the following ways. (i) <b>The</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>aeration</b> (shaking) was reduced, (ii) cyanide {{was added to the}} culture, (iii) the carbon source, acetate, was removed, (iv) a mutant strain was starved of its Krebs cycle intermediates, and (v) respiration was inhibited by mutation. The effect of this respiratory inhibition on the synthesis of a number of enzymes was measured. It was found that the synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) -linked glutamate dehydrogenase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was significantly less inhibited under conditions of respiratory inhibition than was the synthesis of Krebs cycle, glyoxylate cycle, and most other cell proteins synthesized during the adaptation period. This differential inhibition of enzyme synthesis was almost certainly not due to differential repression by regulatory metabolic end product effectors. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration under these conditions most likely results in a limitation of the energy supply of the cell. Thus, it is suggested that the inhibition of synthesis of most proteins after inhibition of mitochondrial respiration results from a lack of energy in a utilizable form. Possible reasons to account for the relative insensitivity of NAD-linked glutamate dehydrogenase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase to inhibition under these conditions are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{discharge}} rate of coarse powders (mean particle size 500 ¿m) from bunkers without aeration {{can be described}} by both empirical relations and theoretical models. In the case of small particles the {{discharge rate}} is largely overestimated. As the powder dilates during flow a negative pressure gradient develops near the hopper outlet, inducing an air flow into the hopper. This extra drag force decreases the discharge rate for fine particles. Aeration of the hopper through a porous cone section will create an opposite pressure gradient, and thereby increase the discharge rate. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to incorporate the dilation in an ad hoc way into the model of Altiner in order to improve its predictive power. To test the modified model we carried out experiments with a fluid catalytic cracking powder to study its discharge as a function of aeration. As the improved model needs a dilation parameter as input, the local bulk density was measured during flow at the outlet and at the bin/hopper junction using gamma-ray absorption. At the bin/hopper junction the bulk density was found to be independent of the discharge rate and equal to the bulk density at minimum fluidisation. At the outlet the bulk density goes through a maximum when <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>aeration</b> gas is increased. Without aeration gas a large dilation, i. e. a 15 ¿ 35 % lower bulk density, was observed. With these data the model predictions improved from 600 % overestimation error to 25 ¿ 90 % underestimation for pure gravity discharge, and from 100 % to 0 ¿ 20 % error for aerated discharge. However, the bulk density at the outlet cannot be predicted from the powder compressibility, as it seems to depend on dilation at fluidisation...|$|E
40|$|Bioremediation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{cost-effective}} and environmentally friendly methods to remediate many different types of waste materials widely used by many private and public entities. Although the parameters that affect the rate of bioremediation differ for each project, some parameters can be more easily controlled in the field than others. For example, effective microbial action is crucial to the success of bioremediation. However, microbes can be detrimentally affected by an initial contaminant concentration that is too high. In addition, the type of bulking agent or aggregate used affects the ability of the mixture to retain moisture, <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> drainage, <b>aeration</b> and ultimately the length of time for biodegradation. A two-month field study was conducted in Trinidad and Tobago on crude oil contaminated waste. This paper will look at the effect of two parameters, initial concentration and type of bulking agent, on the rate of biodegradation of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) in the oily waste being treated in this tropical environment.

30|$|The {{presence}} of lung disease {{has been reported}} to significantly reduce the functional residual capacity compared with healthy subjects [16, 38]. The increase in functional residual capacity due to the application of PEEP is generated by the recruitment of new lung unit and by the over-distension of already open lung unit, and consequently, the final effect will depend on the balance of these two. Numa et al. [16] found in restrictive patients of 2.0  years old a mean functional residual capacity of 14.1  ±  1.9  ml/kg compared with 26.4  ±  1.8  ml/kg in healthy subjects. In the present study, children with ARDS had a significantly lower functional residual capacity compared with healthy subjects (10.4 [9.1 – 14.3] ml/kg compared with 16.6 [11.7 – 24.6] ml/kg). As the compliance of respiratory system is partially related to <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> lung <b>aeration</b> (i.e., end-expiratory lung volume), compliance was significantly lower in ARDS compared with the healthy subjects. However, compliance did not change with <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> tidal volume and/or the level of PEEP, suggesting a mixed effect of possible simultaneous lung recruitment and over-distension. Fletcher et al. [36] found {{a significant increase in the}} compliance of respiratory system when tidal volume was increased from 3.3 to 9.3  ml/kg only in anesthetized children. In children with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, the increase in PEEP from 0 to 18 cmH 2 O improved the compliance of respiratory system in only 60  % of the patients [18].|$|R
