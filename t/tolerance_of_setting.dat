40|$|We {{introduce}} a straightforward experimental approach {{for determining the}} mean flow velocity of a supersonic jet with very high precision. While time measurements easily can achieve accuracies of Δt/t e 10 - 4, typically the absolute flight distances are much less well-defined. This causes significantly increased errors in calculations of the mean flow velocity and mean kinetic energy. The basic concept to improve on this situation is changing the flight distance in vacuo by precisely defined increments employing a linear translation stage. We demonstrate the performance of this method with a flight path that can be varied by approximately 15 % with a <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> <b>setting</b> of 50 μm. In doing so, an unprecedented accurate value for themean flow velocity ofΔv/Ævæ < 3 10 - 4 has been obtained without prior knowledge of the total distance. This very high precision in source pressure, temperature, and particle speed facilitates an improved energetic analysis of condensation processes in supersonic jet expansions. The technique is also of broad interest to other fields employing the strong adiabatic cooling of supersonic beams, in particular, molecular spectroscopy. In the presented case study, a thorough analysis of arrival time spectra of neutral helium implies cluster formation even at elevated temperatures. The formation and growth of clusters in the gas phase is a common phenomenon in nature and technology. The condensa-tion of supersaturated gases also is of fundamental relevance in...|$|E

Firstly, we clarify and distinguish notions of unethical and improper behavior, and how they change when we move from an organizational to a societal point of view.

Cold tolerant chickpea cultivars are needed to successfully utilize a winter sowing approach. A study was conducted at the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), Tel Hadya, Syria during 1982 to 1983 {{with the objective of}} developing a field screening technique for cold tolerance in chickpea, and to identify sources <b>of</b> <b>tolerance.</b> A <b>set</b> <b>of</b> previously identified tolerant, intermediate, and susceptible lines was sown from mid-fall to early spring.

Each product may be represented uniquely as a certain sequence <b>of</b> the Numbers <b>set</b> by technical requirements, drawings and process charts. The set Number may be realised only with a certain probability, therefore, the Number (N) in the initial engineering data is set with a maximum deviation from a mean value, i. e., the tolerance ±ΔN.

40|$|The {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> to {{analgesic action}} {{is one of}} the disadvantages of the repeated use of opiates in the treatment of chronic pain.

The development <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> to morphine has been investigated in several species of animals and this subject has been comprehensively reviewed by Krueger, Eddy, and Sumwalt (2).

40|$|Salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> higher {{plants is}} {{determined}} by a complex <b>set</b> <b>of</b> traits, the timing and rate of evolution of which are largely unknown. We compared the salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> cultivars of sugar beet and their ancestor, sea beet, in hydroponic studies and evaluated whether traditional domestication and more recent breeding have changed salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> the cultivars relative to their ancestor. Our comparison <b>of</b> salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> crop cultivars is based on values of the relative growth rate (RGR) of the entire plant at various salinity levels. We found considerable salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> the sea beet and slightly, but significantly, reduced salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> the sugar beet cultivars. This indicates that traditional domestication by selection for morphological traits such as leaf size, beet shape and size, enhanced productivity, sugar content and palatability slightly affected salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> sugar beet cultivars. Salt tolerance among four sugar beet cultivars, three {{of which have been}} claimed to be salt tolerant, did not differ. We analysed the components of RGR to understand the mechanism <b>of</b> salt <b>tolerance</b> at the whole-plant level. The growth rate reduction at higher salinity was linked with reduced leaf area at the whole-plant level (leaf area ratio) and at the individual leaf level (specific leaf area). The leaf weight fraction was not affected by increased salinity. On the other hand, succulence and leaf thickness and the net assimilation per unit of leaf area (unit leaf rate) increased in response to salt treatment, thus partially counteracting reduced capture of light by lower leaf area. This compensatory mechanism may form part <b>of</b> the salt <b>tolerance</b> mechanism <b>of</b> sea beet and the four studied sugar beet cultivars. Together, our results indicate that domestication of the halophytic ancestor sea beet slightly reduced salt tolerance and that breeding for improved salt <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> sugar beet cultivars has not been effective. ...|$|R
