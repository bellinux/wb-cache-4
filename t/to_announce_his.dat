5|$|After {{a three-year}} hiatus, Pearson planned {{to come out}} of {{retirement}} in 1989, replacing the injured Neil Bonnett in the Wood Brothers' No. 21 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Following testing for the event, however, he suffered severe neck and back pain, and chose instead <b>to</b> <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> retirement; Tommy Ellis replaced Pearson for the race.|$|E
5|$|Also in the off-season, Luongo {{resigned}} {{his team}} captaincy. As Canucks management {{waited until the}} beginning of the 2010–11 season <b>to</b> <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> replacement, Kesler was seen by media and fans as a strong candidate, alongside Henrik Sedin. Henrik was eventually named captain prior to the season-opener and Kesler retained his alternate captaincy.|$|E
5|$|Cook County Assessor James Houlihan {{announced}} that he would not seek re-election in 2010. Within hours, Berrios said he planned <b>to</b> <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> candidacy for assessor.

5|$|After {{being hurt}} {{in a fall}} in his bathtub after {{slipping}} on a bar of soap, Miller was expected to withdraw and the Republican leadership hoped for a deal as late as May 15, the day Miller was to hold a press conference Ohio political observers thought he would use <b>to</b> <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> withdrawal. However, Miller stayed in the race and the two incumbents faced {{each other in the}} Republican primary on June 2, 1992.|$|E
5|$|In April 1964 Monteux {{conducted}} {{his last}} concert, {{which was in}} Milan with the orchestra of Radiotelevisione italiana. The programme consisted of the overture to The Flying Dutchman, Brahms's Double Concerto and Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique. Unrealised plans included his debut at The Proms, and his 90th birthday concert, at which he intended <b>to</b> <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> retirement. In June 1964 Monteux suffered three strokes and a cerebral thrombosis {{at his home in}} Maine, where he died on 1 July at the age of 89.|$|E
5|$|John Sigismund's rule {{began with}} his mother's death. Rather than {{adopting}} a new title, {{he continued to}} style himself rex electus (king-elect). Mihály Csáky, Christopher and Stephen Báthory, and his mother's other advisors continued to participate in state administration. John Sigismund sent envoys to Ferdinand to propose marriage with one of Ferdinand's daughters, but also <b>to</b> <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> claim to the parts of Hungary under Ferdinand's rule. His demands were rejected, but peace was preserved.|$|E

5000|$|The {{following}} year Timberg married Hazel Rosebloom. [...] In addition <b>to</b> <b>announcing</b> <b>his</b> wedding, Variety said that Timberg was {{to star in}} a play, Davy's Debut by Joe LeBrandt (the play was never produced).|$|R
5|$|The 2008 Orange Bowl {{provided}} an excellent national platform for players from both Kansas and Virginia Tech to impress National Football League scouts {{prior to the}} 2008 NFL Draft, held April 26 and April 27, 2008. Virginia Tech cornerback Brandon Flowers {{was one of the}} first Orange Bowl participants <b>to</b> <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> intent to enter the draft following the game.

5|$|Theophilos, in turn, was {{hesitant}} {{to believe the}} accusations, and was eventually convinced by the protovestiarios (chamberlain) Leo Chamodrakon and the synkellos John the Grammarian of his general's innocence. He therefore resolved to get Manuel to return, and sent John the Grammarian to Baghdad on a diplomatic mission {{in the winter of}} 829/830, ostensibly in order <b>to</b> <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> accession. John was indeed able to see Manuel in private and offered him the Emperor's pardon, which Manuel seemed to accept, although for the time being, Manuel remained publicly loyal to his Abbasid allegiance.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of his 1922 {{re-election}} bid, Barkley was the ranking Democrat on the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. In the election, he carried every First District county, including the Republican strongholds of Caldwell and Crittenden counties. Despite the victory he lacked the political organization needed for higher office. According to Barkley biographer James K. Libbey, the establishment of such an organization, and not necessarily a desire to become governor, may have motivated him <b>to</b> <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> candidacy for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination on November 11, 1922. Critics charged that this was his intent, and he did little to deny it.|$|E
50|$|Prior {{to running}} for office, Michael Williams had no {{previous}} political experience. He {{made his living}} running a franchise chain of 18 Sports Clips hair salons for men. He sold these the year prior <b>to</b> <b>announcing</b> <b>his</b> campaign.|$|R

5|$|Despite being {{hindered}} by knee injuries in {{his senior season}} in high school, Croyle was a highly recruited prospect by Louisiana State University, Florida State University, and the University of Alabama. On the night Croyle was ready <b>to</b> <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> decision to attend Florida State, {{he changed his mind}} and chose Alabama, his father's alma mater, instead. In Croyle's four years playing for the Alabama Crimson Tide football team, he set numerous school records, and was a finalist for the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award. Croyle led the Crimson Tide to the 2006 Cotton Bowl Classic and was named the game's offensive MVP.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, 1851, Henry Clay {{submitted}} {{a letter of}} resignation of his seat in the U.S. Senate, to be effective September 1 of the following year (1852). Clay's announcement came while the Kentucky General Assembly was in session. This was intentional. The majority of the Assembly was Whig, and Clay {{knew that if he}} resigned while the Assembly was in session, the majority would elect a Whig to be his successor. By contrast, if he had waited until September 1 <b>to</b> <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> resignation the Assembly would already have closed its session, and Governor Powell, a Democrat, would appoint a temporary successor until the legislature convened again two years later.|$|E
5|$|On March 27, 1979, Brown {{interrupted}} his honeymoon with Phyllis George <b>to</b> <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> {{candidacy for}} governor of Kentucky. The announcement surprised most political observers because of his prior political apathy and because Brown had spent considerable time {{out of the state}} with his business ventures and lavish lifestyle. Funding his campaign with his own personal fortune, Brown launched a massive media campaign promoting his candidacy to help him overcome his late start in the race. He promised to run the state government like a business and to be a salesman for the state as governor.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2010, Glassman {{entered the}} race for United States Senate {{as a member of}} the Democratic Party.

Even though Savisaar first <b>announced</b> <b>his</b> candidacy, he later {{announced that he would}} not participate the leadership election and instead endorsed Toom.|$|R
50|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>announcing</b> <b>his</b> Senate campaign, Donnelly {{commented that}} he was {{confident}} that a Democrat {{would be able to}} win the district, noting that then-Senator Barack Obama would have received 49% of the vote in the district in the 2008 presidential election had it been held under the newly drawn boundaries.|$|R
5|$|Schiff {{had been}} {{considering}} running {{for mayor of}} Minneapolis in the 2013 Minneapolis mayoral election as early as June 2012, and stated that his ultimate decision would not be contingent upon whether mayor R.T. Rybak opted to run for another term. Speaking from the Harriet Brewing tap room on January 29, 2013, Schiff announced his official candidacy for the position. On the same day, he also held an event in the Dinkytown area near the University of Minnesota with rapper Brother Ali to kick off his campaign. Schiff was the second City Councilmember <b>to</b> <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> candidacy after Betsy Hodges of Ward 13, and Don Samuels of Ward 5 announced his candidacy later.|$|E
5|$|According to his biographer Roland Huntford, the {{references}} to Shackleton's physical breakdown made in Scott's The Voyage of the Discovery, published in 1905, reopened the wounds to Shackleton's pride. It became a personal mission that he should return to the Antarctic and outperform Scott. He began looking for potential backers for an expedition of his own; his initial plans appear in an unpublished document dated early 1906. These include a cost estimate of £17,000 (updated value £) for the entire expedition. He received his first promise of financial backing when early in 1907 his employer, Beardmore, offered a £7,000 loan guarantee (updated value £). With this in hand, Shackleton felt confident enough <b>to</b> <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> intentions to the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) on 12 February 1907. One reason for Shackleton's sense of urgency was {{the knowledge that the}} Polish explorer Henryk Arctowski was planning an expedition, which was announced at the RGS on the same day as Shackleton's. In the event, Arctowski's plans were stillborn.|$|E
5|$|As Bradley's term {{drew to a}} close, {{potential}} Republican {{candidates to}} succeed him were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election as {{a sure sign that}} the state would vote Democratic in 1899. Others were not interested in being on the defensive against the inevitable Democratic attacks on Bradley's administration. Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law. Sitting attorney general William S. Taylor was the first <b>to</b> <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> candidacy and soon secured the support of Senator Deboe. Later candidates included Hopkins County judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state auditor Sam H. Stone. The former was Bradley's choice, but Taylor was a skilled political organizer and was able to create a strong political machine amongst the county delegations. He seemed the favorite to win the nomination.|$|E
5000|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>announcing</b> <b>his</b> {{re-election}} candidacy, Curtis {{commissioned a}} poll of himself versus potential candidate James S.

That consultant, Elizabeth Van Holt of Isaiah Consulting, appeared with McCarter when he <b>announced</b> <b>his</b> congressional candidacy on October 7, 2015. State law prohibits {{the use of such}} campaign funds for federal races. McCarter said the money was paid for work related to his State Senate seat.|$|R
5|$|Beshear was {{the first}} {{candidate}} <b>to</b> <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> bid for the post of Attorney General of Kentucky in the 1979 election. Shortly after declaring his candidacy, he was endorsed by outgoing Attorney General Robert F. Stephens. The central issue of Beshear's campaign was his pledge to be an advocate of the consumer in cases of proposed utility rate hikes. After winning the Democratic primary, he defeated Republican nominee Ron Snyder {{by a vote of}} 471,177 to 302,951. When incumbent Attorney General Stephens resigned in December 1979 to accept an appointment to the Kentucky Supreme Court, Beshear was appointed to fill the vacancy until his term officially began in January. As attorney general, Beshear created the state's first Medicaid fraud division and his office took {{a leading role in the}} Leviticus Project, an eight-state coalition committed to prosecuting organized crime in the country's coal fields.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, {{he joined}} Arsenal; his {{performances}} {{at the club}} were indifferent to begin with and attracted criticism from football pundits and fans alike. By {{the end of his}} first season, Overmars became a focal point of Arsenal's league and cup double success. He scored the winning goal against league rivals Manchester United which set his team on their way to securing the Premier League title and opened the scoring against Newcastle United in the 1998 FA Cup Final. In 2000, he moved to Barcelona in a deal worth £25million and became the most expensive player in Dutch football history. The club failed to win silverware during his stay and numerous managerial changes made him a peripheral player. A persistent knee injury prompted Overmars <b>to</b> <b>announce</b> <b>his</b> retirement in 2004, but he reversed his decision in 2008 and went on to play one season for Go Ahead Eagles before retiring again. In 2012, he was named as Ajax's director of football.|$|E

Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law.
