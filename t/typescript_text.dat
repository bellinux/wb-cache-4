But the case for a new edition is stronger than that. Owing to the extraordinary conditions of its composition and transmission, approximately five hundred corruptions of Pound's <b>typescript</b> <b>text</b> survived into the poem's first English and American publications. Pound's typescript of the Pisan Cantos was prepared during his incarceration in the US Army Disciplinary Training Center (DTC) an American military prison camp near Pisa during the summer and autumn of 1945, and was the product of the harsh conditions of his imprisonment (his wavering memory following a mental breakdown, his lack of books, and the many errors he inevitably produced typing at odd hours on unfamiliar typewriters). Just as seriously, many of Pound's emended carbons never reached his editors at New Directions and he was forced during his continued incarceration in the U. S. to delegate responsibility for many kinds of correction he would normally have made himself. He was also denied access to his originals at every stage proofing. Although there can never be a definitively " corrected edition " of the Pisan Cantos because Pound made inconsistent emendations on different typescript leaves and kept his publishers in the dark about which instances of idiosyncratic spelling, quotation, and punctuation he wished them to correct, {{this does not mean that}} an edition cannot be established that eliminates the corruptions that later crept into the text and that carries out Pound's implicit and explicit expectations for producing the poem, many of which his first editors never fully understood. A critical edition based on the typescripts Pound produced at Pisa and including a complete historical apparatus is currently in preparation with Oxford University Press and will not only achieve these aims but also make it possible to understand the deficiencies of the poem's currently circulating texts.

These expanded lectures were first published in a 1931 French translation by Gabrielle Peiffer and Emmanuel Levinas with advice from Alexandre Koyré. They were published in German, along with the original Pariser Vortrage, in 1950, and again in an English translation by Dorion Cairns in 1960, based on a <b>typescript</b> of the <b>text</b> (<b>Typescript</b> C) which Husserl had designated for Cairns in 1933.|$|R

40|$|The LdoD Archive is {{a dynamic}} digital archive based on Fernando Pessoa’s Livro do Desassossego [“L. do D. ”] [URL] The Archive {{contains}} facsimiles and textual transcriptions of autograph witnesses (manuscripts, <b>typescripts,</b> printed <b>texts)</b> as well as textual transcriptions of four editions of the Book of Disquiet published between 1982 and 2012. All variations across the textual corpus have been marked up in TEI-conformant XML. This granular encoding has enabled us to automate comparisons between any 2, 3, 4 or 5 versions of any given fragment, both at the micro-scale of textual form, and at the macro-scale of bibliographic structure. Besides the set of functionalities related to the scholarly level of the archive, the LdoD Archive provides a set of software tools that allow readers to generate further content by creating their own editions and annotations within the archive’s virtual layer, and by writing their own variations based on specific passages. The research for this project culminated in a dynamic model for a digital archive, which brings collaborative computing techniques into the universe of critical editing and reading in digital media. This article discusses the conceptual and technical virtualization of the Book of Disquiet as a digital simulation of the dynamic nature of textual fields, and presents the project’s workflow from expert encoding to end-user interaction.
