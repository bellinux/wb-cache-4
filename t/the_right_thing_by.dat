40|$|This {{is not the}} 1950 ’s where test pilots {{needed the}} ‘right stuff’ and {{certainly}} not the beginning of aviation where the Wright brother’s early designs needed pilots with more than <b>the</b> <b>right</b> stuff. In those formative years of aviation and jet development, designers and pilots {{did not have the}} same design understanding and knowledge that we have today. In addition, they did not have the same understanding and knowledge of Systems Safety engineering and Human Factors expertise that we have today. Manned suborbital flights of today should be undertaken in vehicles that have been designed effectively with appropriately derived safety requirements including fault-tolerance, safe life and design-for-minimum risk approaches – and all to an acceptable level of safety. Therefore, although initial suborbital pilots will originate from flight test schools and still possess similar traits to their earlier test pilot brethren, they should be protected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> (safe) <b>thing</b> <b>by</b> design and analysis rather than rely on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> stuff due to ineffective design and operating procedures.

This return occurred {{one hundred and}} forty {{four years after the}} Indian Island massacre. This research explores the returning of sacred tribal land in the context of collective apologies and reconciliations after generations of Native genocide. 	The significance of this case study includes a detailed narration of how the land transfer occurred and more importantly why it was labeled ???<b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> to do??? <b>by</b> Eureka City Council members and staff. 	This case study was examined with a grounded theory methodology. Using no hypotheses, the research and the research methodology unfolded in a non-linear process, letting the research speak for itself. Detailed interviews and a review of documents were used to qualify and quantify this unique community based social act. 	The results of this case study include how and why the Eureka City Council returned forty acres of Indian Island to the Wiyot people. <b>The</b> phrase ???<b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> to do??? was the frequent patterned statement made by Eureka City Council members and staff and is their explanation to why the land transfer happened. I have dissected this statement and have identified two main themes which include recognition and acknowledgment and historical features and importance. These two themes are then connected to the research on collective apologies and reconciliations. 	My recommendations for continuing my unique case study are included as well as suggestions for more broad based collective apology and reconciliation processes. In conclusion, it is still my hope and desire that all of Indian Island will be returned to the Wiyot tribe as soon as possible. As my research shows, it is ???<b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> to do???, and I hope actions are made to facilitate that process sooner than later...|$|R

Typically, the contractor submits an initial schedule for approval, however, {{due to the lack}} of experience and knowledge, scheduling software and computer hardware to verify schedule logic, relationships, activity content, and budgeted cost allocation, many construction schedules are approved based on their graphical appearance and the faith in the contractor to do <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing.</b> As required <b>by</b> project specifications, monthly update schedules are normally provided by the contractor, however, many of them either are updated incorrectly or don't accurately reflect the actual work sequence of the project. The current Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) guide specification provides basic guidance, however, it has proven to be an ineffective tool because of unclear and ambiguous directions and guidance. Further, many sections of this specification are obsolete or contradictory to industry standards and court rulings. Claims court journals are filled with case law examples involving suits against the Navy for schedule related issues. The American Arbitration Association has handled many arbitration and mediation cases involving these issues as well. The energy, effort, and intent demonstrated by Contracting Officers and their representatives have been sincere and noteworthy.
