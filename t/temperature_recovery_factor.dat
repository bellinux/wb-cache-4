40|$|ASME LectureIce {{ingestion}} {{has caused}} damage and subsequent failures of a Solar Mars 100 natural gas pipeline gas turbine on two separate occasions in Seligman Arizona. Understanding this phenomenon and the required ambient conditions {{is key to}} preventing ice related failures in the future. This paper investigates the required ambient temperature and relative humidity for inlet ice formation. It presents the data collected from an on site ambient temperature and relative humidity meter {{as well as a}} real time bell-mouth inlet camera. An ambient temperature and relative humidity meter was installed on site and used to protect the turbine by shutting it down (trip) based on high relative humidity and low ambient temperatures. The initial criteria of relative humidity greater then 95 % and ambient temperature less then 35. 5 ?F (1. 9 ?C) used to trip and protect the unit were a combination of an educated guess and values cited in General Electric document Gas Turbine Inlet Air Treatment. [1] To further refine these trip parameters and better understand the inlet icing process, a camera was installed in the turbine inlet housing {{with a view of the}} bell-mouth and inlet guide vanes (IGV). This provided real time images of the inlet icing phenomena that was then correlated with the ambient temperature and relative humidity (RH). Also, the camera images showed, after a significant icing event, that pieces of ice sloughed off the IGVs and were ingested by the turbine. Weather Radar data collected from www. weather. com shows that this can occur without precipitation. The theory of inlet ice formation was investigated using the Magnus equation for dew-point calculations and the ?Ideal Gas Law? with an assumption of constant specific heat for the flowing inlet temperature depression. Using a <b>temperature</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> of. 8 (this has been supported by numerical modeling in previous research by Stewart [2]) the inlet guide vane temperature depression was predicted to be 6. 9 ?F (3. 8 ?C). With this IGV temperature depression, icing was predicted for ambient temperatures less then 38. 9 ?F (32 + 6. 9 ?F) (3. 8 ?C) and RH above 74 to 76 %. Evidence is also given for inlet ice formation on a General Electric model Frame 3 turbine at the same location. The collected RH, ambient temperature data and inlet camera images suggest condensate and not precipitate icing could be the root cause of the past ice ingestion failures. With the ambient temperature, RH data and bell-mouth camera images, the temperature depression at the inlet guide vanes was measured to be about 9. 5 ?F (5. 3 ?C). The <b>temperature</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> (RF) was shown to be 0. 73. A 9. 5 ?F (5. 3 ?C) IGV temperature drop will result in IGV ice when ambient temperatures are below 41. 5 ?F (32 + 9. 5 ?F) (5. 3 ?C) and RH above 67 to 69 %. Setting the trip criteria to guarantee ice free operation will negatively impact the reliability and drop it to unacceptable levels. The original trip criteria of relative humidity greater then 95 % and ambient temperature less then 35. 5 ?F (1. 9 ?C) remain and are now seen as an acceptable compromise. Inlet air heating as a method of preventing inlet ice formation will be discussed. The amount of heat added to the inlet air to guarantee ice free operation is determined to be greater than 250 hp (186 kW). Finally, options for the inlet air heating energy source are suggested...|$|E

The first phase was {{an investigation of}} the viscous effects on measured impact pressures. The second was {{an investigation of the}} temperature recovery characteristics of a singly shielded total-temperature probe. Experimental results are presented for a straight, sharp-lipped, cylindrical, impact-pressure probe and for a flattened-end probe. Impact-pressure data were obtained for a Reynolds number range from 425 to 8, 000, where the Reynolds number was based on free stream conditions and the impact probe outside diameter, The data show that the Rayleigh equation requires corrections for viscous effects at Reynolds numbers less than 6, 000 for the circular sharp-tipped probe and less than 4, 000 for the flattened-end probe. The viscous effects increase with decreasing Remolds numbers. At a Reynolds number of 425, the measured impact pressure is approximately 2. 5 per cent lower than that predicted by the Rayleigh equation. It was concluded that the viscous effects were dependent on Mach number as well as Reynolds number. Temperature recovery factors for the total-temperature probe were obtained throughout a Reynolds number range from 30, 800 to 213, 000, where the Reynolds number was based on the probe entrance outside diameter and the free stream conditions.

40|$|The {{presented}} paper {{regards the}} influence of one of similarity criteria – the Prandtl number of gas (Pr) - on {{the efficiency of the}} machine-less energetic separation device (Leontiev pipe), using numerical modeling in ANSYS software. This device, equally as Rank-Hilsch and Hartman-Schprenger pipes, is designed to separate one gas flow into two flows with different temperatures. One flow (supersonic) streams out of the pipe with a temperature higher than initial and the other (subsonic) flows out with a temperature lower than initial. This direction of energetic separation is true if the Prandtl number is less than 1 that corresponds to gases. The Prandtl number affects the efficiency of running Leontiev pipe indirectly both through a temperature difference on which a <b>temperature</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> has an impact and through a thermal conductivity coefficient that shows the impact of heat transfer intensity between gas and solid wall. The Prandtl number range in the course of research was from 0. 1 to 0. 7. The Prandtl number value equal to 0. 7 corresponds to the air or pure gases (for example, inert argon gas). The Prandtl number equal to 0. 2 corresponds to the mixtures of inert gases such as helium-xenon. The numerical modeling completed for the supersonic flow with Mach number 2. 0 shows that efficiency of the machine-less energetic separation device has been increased approximately 2 times with the Prandtl number decreasing from 0. 7 to 0. 2. Moreover, for the counter-flow scheme this effect is a little higher due to its larger heat efficiency in comparison with the straight-flow one. Also, the research shows that the main problem for the further increase of the Leontiev pipe efficiency is a small value of thermal conductivity coefficient, which requires an intensification of the heat exchange, especially in the supersonic flow. It can be obtained, for example, by using a system of oblique shock waves in the supersonic channel. </p...|$|E
40|$|The paper investigates an {{influence}} of helium fraction (light gases) on the Prandtl number value for binary {{and more complex}} gas mixtures. It is shown that a low value of the Prandtl number (Pr-number) results in decreasing a <b>temperature</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> value and, respectively, in reducing a recovery temperature value on the wall (thermoinsulated wall temperature) with the compressive gas flow bypassing it. This, in turn, allows us to increase efficiency of gasdynamic energy separation in Leontyev's tube. The paper conducts a numerical research {{of the influence of}} binary and more complex gas mixture composition on the Prandtl number value. It is shown that a mixture of two gases with small and large molecular weight allows us to produce a mixture with a lower value of the Prandtl number in comparison with the initial gases. Thus, the value of Prandtl number decreases by 1. 5 - 3. 2 times in comparison with values for pure components (the more a difference of molar mass of components, the stronger is a decrease). The technique to determine the Prandtl number value for mixtures of gases in the wide range of temperatures and pressure is developed. Its verification based on experimental data and results of numerical calculations of other authors is executed. It is shown that it allows correct calculation of binary and more complex mixtures of gases For the mixtures of inert gases it has been obtained that the minimum value of the Prandtl number is as follows: for helium - xenon mixtures (He-Xe) makes 0. 2 - 0. 22, for helium - krypton mixtures (He-Kr) – 0. 3, for helium - argon mixes (He-Ar) – 0. 41. For helium mixture with carbon dioxide the minimum value of the Prandtl number makes about 0. 4, for helium mixture with N 2 nitrogen the minimum value of the Prandtl number is equal to 0. 48, for helium-methane (CH 4) - 0. 5 and helium – oxygen (O 2) – 0. 46. This decrease is caused {{by the fact that the}} thermal capacity of mixture changes under the linear law in regard to the mass concentration of components while the viscosity and heat conductivity change under more complicated laws. Just this mismatch leads to having the local minimum for the Prandtl number value. </p...|$|E

It is shown that using helium binary gas mixtures with low Prandtl number Pr values as working fluids instead of pure helium in closed Brayton cycle gas turbine power plants leads to significant drop in the turbo-machinery aerodynamic loading with retention of the heat transfer coefficients in heat-exchangers and with sustainable growth in the pressure losses along the power plant loop components.

The paper analyses {{the influence of}} different factors on the value r. Shows that using the gas mixtures with low Pr values as working fluids, injecting gas into supersonic flow boundary layer through permeable wall and arranging regular relief on the wall surface are the most promising solutions for decreasing the value r. Examines the methodologies and correlations known from available open sources to calculate the r values depending on Pr, Reynolds number Re x and Mach number M and presents the calculation results obtained through these correlations for Pr 0, 1 … 1, Re x 10 5 … 10 9 and M up to 4. Practically, all the methodologies and correlations examined are in good agreement with experimental data obtained for air with Pr ≈ 0, 7 over the intervals of Re x and M considered. However, with further reduction of Pr value the calculation results for r diverge for different methodologies and correlations with up to 35 – 40 % difference for Pr ≈ 0, 2 for those which are in good agreement with the air experimental data.

30|$|The {{results show}} that the <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> after polymer {{flooding}} is basically same for the heterogeneous cores with same permeability max–min ratio. The cross-linking agent can considerably improve the <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> after polymer flooding. The concentration 100  mg/L obtained the highest rate of EOR effect.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the method {{to estimate the}} true formation <b>temperature</b> using <b>temperature</b> <b>recovery</b> logging data after the well reach to total depth (T. D.). The method designated as ''Curve-fitting method (CFM) '' is based on mathematical model proposed by Middleton (1979, 1982). The accuracy and applicability of this method are evaluated with several field data and compared advantageously with the Horner-plot method. Then, real-time data acquisition system including interpretation software has also been successfully developed. As a conclusion, the followings are confirmed: (1) The developed CFM can be applicable to the estimation of the true formation temperature even using 24 hours <b>temperature</b> <b>recovery</b> data, although the Horner-plot method might need up to 120 hours recovery data, usually. (2) Though depending upon {{the quality of the}} data and/or number of the <b>temperature</b> <b>recovery</b> logging data, {{it might be possible to}} estimate the true formation temperature using less than 24 hours recovery data. Because, the computer program of this system has the function to decide when the measurement of <b>temperature</b> <b>recovery</b> logging should be finished...|$|R

30|$|Previous {{experiences}} and simulations {{have shown that}} well placement affects the <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> and breakthrough time. Some reservoir and operating parameters of three major oil-sand projects in Alberta, Canada were studied by Shin and Polikar (2005) numerically, {{one of which was}} the injector to producer spacing. The results showed that an increase in the injector to producer spacing leads to an increment in the <b>recovery</b> <b>factor,</b> however, it prolongs the breakthrough time. For example, in 5  m well spacing, the <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> was 42  % and increased to 49  % for 15 meter well spacing.|$|R

The recommended value of local subsonic <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> for use in calculating the effective gas temperature for gas turbine blades was 0. 89...|$|R
