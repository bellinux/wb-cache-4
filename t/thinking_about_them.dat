500|$|Kubrick was {{notorious for}} {{demanding}} multiple takes during filming to perfect his art, and his relentless approach was often extremely demanding for his actors. Jack Nicholson remarked that Kubrick would often demand up to fifty takes of a scene. Nicole Kidman {{explains that the}} large number of takes he often required stopped actors from consciously thinking about technique, thereby helping them enter a [...] "deeper place". Kubrick's high take ratio was considered by some critics as [...] "irrational", although he firmly believed that actors were at their best during the filming, as opposed to rehearsals, due to the sense of intense excitement that it generates. Kubrick explained: [...] "Actors are essentially emotion-producing instruments, and some are always tuned and ready while others will reach a fantastic pitch on one take and never equal it again, no matter how hard they try"... "When you make a movie, it takes a few days just {{to get used to the}} crew, because it is like getting undressed in front of fifty people. Once you're accustomed to them, the presence of even one other person on set is discordant and tends to produce self-consciousness in the actors, and certainly in itself". He also told biographer Michel Clement: [...] "It's invariably because the actors don't know their lines, or don't know them well enough. An actor can only do one thing at a time, and when he learned his lines only well enough to say them while he's <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> he will always have trouble as soon as he has to work on the emotions of the scene or find camera marks. In a strong emotional scene, it is always best to be able to shoot in complete takes to allow the actor a continuity of emotion, and it is rare for most actors to reach their peak more than once or twice. There are, occasionally, scenes which benefit from extra takes, but even then, I'm not sure that the early takes aren't just glorified rehearsals with the adding adrenaline of film running through the camera." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2009, Marshall, Mike Hall and Colin Harris {{founded the}} Merseyside Skeptics Society. He commented that {{skepticism}} is [...] "not about just saying 'no' to things, it's about <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> And {{we use the}} American spelling – skeptic – because, in the States, the word isn't as strongly linked to cynicism.

[...] In July that year, they launched the podcast Skeptics with a K, which Marshall described as [...] "a fairly-shambolic, overly-enthusiastic and snarky mix of science, skepticism and sarcasm." [...] The idea for SwaK came from the conversations Mike and Marsh were having in the pub about news and ideas, such as a homeopathy overdose, {{that they wanted to}} share with a wider audience.|$|E

Critics argued that the search was an abuse of taxpayer dollars, as no ordinary citizen would receive similar treatment. Clinton said that afternoon that the Kennedys had [...] "suffered much, and given more", and also called for them to feel [...] "the strength of God, the love of their friends and the prayers of their fellow citizens".|$|E

2500|$|Exposure therapy {{involves}} gradually exposing {{individuals to}} a stimuli they find disturbing or fear inducing until {{it no longer}} provokes an emotional response. [...] The stimuli can range from commonly feared situations and objects, such as heights or speaking publicly, to seemingly mundane objects and places that have become distressing through a traumatic experience. If someone is exposed to a traumatic experience it is common that being exposed to reminders, including memories, of the event will trigger anxiety attacks, emotional distress and flashbacks. A common mechanism {{to deal with these}} potential triggers is to avoid <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> and to avoid situations where they may be exposed to them. This can affect quality of life by limiting where someone feels they can go and what a person feels comfortable doing. Evidence has been found linking early traumatic experiences with agoraphobia, an anxiety disorder where individuals fear having panic attacks outdoors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} I {{challenge}} the widespread {{assumption that the}} conditions for singular reference {{are more or less}} the same as the conditions for singular thought. I claim that we refer singularly to things without <b>thinking</b> singularly <b>about</b> <b>them</b> more often than it is usually believed. I first argue that we should take the idea that singular thought is non-descriptive thought very seriously. If we do that, it seems that we cannot be so liberal about what counts as acquaintance; only perception (and memory) will do. I also briefly discuss and reject semantic instrumentalism. Finally, I argue that while singular reference is cheap, singular thought comes only at a price...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} {{exploring}} various models of spiritual development. It first addresses philosophical dilemmas underpinning {{the concept of}} spiritual development by questioning whether these can be addressed without metaphysical assumptions embedded in religious worldviews and thus understood in any consensual way across different historical and cultural contexts. Traditional models of spiritual development are then reviewed, drawing from indigenous, Eastern, and Western cultures. Integrative-philosophical and scientific models, including those from the psychology of religion, transpersonal psychology, and neurobiology, are then presented. The chapter concludes by noting the complexities involved in understanding spiritual development accompanied by suggestions on future directions for these models by highlighting their commonalities and differences and by providing some evaluative perspectives for <b>thinking</b> critically <b>about</b> <b>them...</b>|$|R

5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily children, who have already developed or {{are in the process}} of developing this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby <b>thinking</b> flexibly <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> Similarly, in order to be cognitively flexible they must overcome centration, which is the tendency for young children to solely focus on one aspect of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely able to focus on one aspect of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, then they will be more cognitively inflexible.|$|R

This thesis makes progress in this area by creating a classification system for the space of interac-tive location-based entertainment experiences.

The theory also guides the birth of a library of interactive design techniques {{and the development of a}} design approach as a series of steps and questions that must be answered to complete an experience. It is proposed that across a variety of experience types (games, rides, theater shows and museum installations), the design approach will be similar. It i...|$|R

Supply chains tend to be rather complex entities, and the act of <b>thinking</b> strategically <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> what we call supply chain 'strategizing', reflects this complexity.

Yet everyone would agree that customers are affected by the work of the IT team, and the best organizations are deliberate in aligning IT priorities with the needs of customers.
