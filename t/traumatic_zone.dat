40|$|Three {{patterns}} of degeneration were distinguished in the Rhesus monkey optic nerve following eye enucleation. (1) A <b>traumatic</b> <b>zone,</b> extending for 1 to 2 mm {{from the site}} of transection and characterized by a rapid infiltration of haematogenous macrophages, the rapid degeneration and removal of all neural elements and the formation of astrocytic scar tissue within 35 days. (2) A conical zone, closely associated with the central retinal blood vessels, in which the pattern of degeneration was similar to the <b>traumatic</b> <b>zone</b> except that the onset was delayed and the removal of debris was slower. There was extensive vesiculation of myelin sheaths in these two zones which was indicative of haematogenous cell infiltration. (3) The remainder of the nerve underwent classical Wallerian degeneration in which endogenous cells slowly phagocytosed the degenerating nerve fibres. These observations are considered relevant to the controversy concerning the identification of the macrophage involved in Wallerian degeneration; many studies have described the macrophage within the area of trauma rather than the macrophage involved at some distance {{from the site of}} trauma...|$|E
40|$|In adults, {{mallet finger}} is a <b>traumatic</b> <b>zone</b> I lesion of the {{extensor}} tendon with either tendon rupture or bony avulsion {{at the base}} of the distal phalanx. High-energy mechanisms of injury generally occur in young men, whereas lower energy mechanisms are observed in elderly women. The mechanism of injury is an axial load applied to a straight digit tip, which is then followed by passive extreme distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ) hyperextension or hyperflexion. Mallet finger is diagnosed clinically, but an X-ray should always be performed. Tubiana's classification takes into account the size of the bony articular fragment and DIPJ subluxation. We propose to stage subluxated fractures as stage III if the subluxation is reducible with a splint and as stage IV if not. Left untreated, mallet finger becomes chronic and leads to a swan-neck deformity and DIPJ osteoarthritis. The goal of treatment is to restore active DIPJ extension. The results of a six- to eight-week conservative course of treatment with a DIPJ splint in slight hyperextension for tendon lesions or straight for bony avulsions depends on patient compliance. Surgical treatments vary in terms of the approach, the reduction technique, and the means of fixation. The risks involved are stiffness, septic arthritis, and osteoarthritis. Given the lack of consensus regarding indications for treatment, we propose to treat all cases of mallet finger with a dorsal glued splint except for stage IV mallet finger, which we treat with extra-articular pinning...|$|E
40|$|The second {{presentation}} {{will describe}} findings {{from a series}} of empirical studies conducted in zones of persistent and cumulative exposure to <b>traumatic</b> stress. The <b>zones</b> under examination include Sri Lanka, India, Sudan, Haiti, Japan, and the West Bank of the Jordan River. The findings are discussed in terms their implications for public health (both “physical” and “mental”), spiritual and emotional wellbeing, and the reciprocal influences of culture and traumatic experiences...|$|R
40|$|Pathogenicity of {{the pine}} wood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, to Japanese larch, Larix kaempferi, {{seedlings}} was tested with inoculation experiments under nursery conditions. Water suspensions of nematodes (mixed stages cultured on Botrytis cinerea or dispersal fourth-stage juveniles (DJ 4) extracted from the adult Japanese pine sawyer, Monochamus alternatus) were injected into the stems of 2 - and 3 -year-old Japanese larch and Japanese black pine, Pinus thunbergii, seedlings growing in a nursery. In another treatment, Japanese pine sawyer adults holding DJ 4 were released under a net that covered {{the upper half of}} the seedlings. Regardless of nematode inoculation method, Japanese larch seedlings were as susceptible as Japanese black pine seedlings to B. xylophilus under nursery conditions. The rate of disease development was similar on larch and pine seedlings. Nematode population densities were lower in the stems of dead larch seedlings than in the stems of dead pine seedlings. Histopathological observations revealed that the distribution of nematodes in the stems of dead larch seedlings was mostly limited to the cortex, phloem and cambial <b>zone.</b> <b>Traumatic</b> resin canal formation {{was one of the most}} characteristic symptoms in larch seedlings which was dissimilar to that in pine seedlings...|$|R
40|$|For a {{large number}} of veterans, war does not end after they are removed from a combat <b>zone.</b> <b>Traumatic</b> stress affects nearly all veterans, but while the {{majority}} of veterans learn to live with their experiences, for some veterans traumatic stress seethes inside. In this dissertation posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Dutch veterans was examined using different neuroimaging techniques and neuropsychological assessment. In the first two chapters, {{a review of the literature}} is reported, in which studies on hippocampal volumetry were examined. From this database the methodology of all original manual tracing protocols of the hippocampus were studied, and discussed in relation to optimizing determination of hippocampal volume. In addition, hippocampal volumetric findings in neuropsychiatric disorders were reported, and possible mechanisms of hippocampal volume loss were discussed. Advances in computational image analysis provide new opportunities to use semi-automatic techniques to determine cortical thickness. Veterans with and without PTSD, were examined with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and individual cortical thickness maps were calculated. Veterans with PTSD revealed reduced cortical thickness in the bilateral frontal gyri, and the left superior temporal gyrus. Differences in the benzodiazepine-GABAA receptor complex in Dutch veterans with and without deployment-related PTSD were examined using [11 C]-flumazenil and PET. Region of interest (ROI) analysis using both template-based and manual ROIs revealed significantly reduced [11 C]-flumazenil binding in PTSD subjects throughout the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. Although clinical studies have described altered pain experience in patients with PTSD, few empirical studies have examined pain processing in PTSD in detail. The neural correlates of pain processing in Dutch veterans with deployment-related PTSD and control veterans were examined with fMRI. Veterans with PTSD revealed increased activation in the left hippocampus, and decreased activation in the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and the right amygdala during stimulation with a fixed temperature compared to controls. The witnessed neural activation pattern is proposed to be related to altered pain processing in patients with PTSD. In another fMRI study, neural correlates of associative learning and memory in veterans with PTSD and control veterans were assessed. Veterans with PTSD revealed underactivation of the frontal cortex, and overactivation of the temporal cortex during encoding of word-pairs compared to control veterans without PTSD. Retrieval of the word-pairs resulted in underactivation of right frontal cortex, bilateral middle temporal gyri, and the left parahippocampal gyrus in veterans with PTSD. Finally, the results of a neuropsychological study on memory performance in PTSD and its relation to social and occupational functioning were reported. Veterans with PTSD had similar total IQ scores compared to veterans without PTSD, but displayed deficits of figural and logical memory. Veterans with PTSD also performed significantly lower on measures of learning and immediate and delayed verbal memory. Memory performance accurately predicted current social and occupational functioning. These neurobiological alterations witnessed in veterans with PTSD show that the problems experienced by them are not just 'figments of the imagination' but very real neurobiological consequences of traumatic stress. It is this neurobiological 'war within' that we should learn to wage and win...|$|R
