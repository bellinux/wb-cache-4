25|$|According to John Quigley, however, it {{is clear}} from the context in which it was adopted, and from the {{statements}} recounted by the delegates, <b>that</b> <b>Resolution</b> 242 contemplates the Palestine Arab refugees only.|$|E
25|$|<b>That</b> <b>Resolution</b> 194 {{resolved}} {{that that}} refugees {{willing to live}} in peace with their neighbors should be allowed to return, and that many Palestinians who fled were unwilling {{to live in peace}} and were responsible for attacks against Jews.

Dakhlallah said that Syria will merely move its troops to eastern Lebanon.

25|$|Caledonian's transatlantic growth {{strategy}} {{focused on}} {{taking advantage of}} strong ethnic ties of overseas Scottish communities in North America {{to the land of}} their ancestors and an obscure International Air Transport Association (IATA) resolution dating from 1953. Under this resolution, airlines were permitted to offer cut-price charter tariffs if these were negotiated with an individual representing a distinct group that shared a common affinity among its members prior to the application for charter transportation. The way independent charter operators like Caledonian, who were not IATA members, interpreted <b>that</b> <b>resolution</b> was that it applied to closed groups only whose primary purpose of travel was their common interest or kinship, rather than securing cheap air fares for its members. IATA imposed further restrictions on airlines seeking to exploit this loophole by insisting that any agent booking these flights had their commission capped at 5%, that the affinity group's membership could not exceed 20,000 and that those seeking to avail themselves of these offers must have been members for at least six months prior to the commencement of travel. These restrictions were designed to protect IATA members' transatlantic scheduled traffic by preventing non-members from undercutting them.|$|E
25|$|A {{protracted}} {{conflict between}} pedestrians and cyclists plagued the seawall for years. Strolling pedestrians {{took issue with}} cyclists speeding by, while cyclists felt they {{had a right to}} cycle the seawall. As traffic increased over time, collisions were becoming more frequent. Cycling on the seawall was consequently outlawed, and by 1976, the Vancouver Police Department had issued 3,000 tickets to offenders. A solution was proposed in 1977 by a Calgary-based group of charitable foundations. It offered to pay $900,000 to widen the path on the English Bay side to six metres in order to accommodate both cyclists and pedestrians on the condition that the city match that amount. The proposal triggered an outcry from environmentalist groups, such as the Save Our Parkland Association. City council nonetheless agreed to the plan, but conflict between user groups persisted. The issue was not resolved until 1984 when the bicycle lane of the seawall was designated one-way in a counterclockwise direction around the park, which it remains today. <b>That</b> <b>resolution</b> brought fewer accidents, but as late as 1993, proposals to ban cycling on the seawall continued to be put forth. The popularity of inline skating in the 1990s also contributed to the debate over seawall use, as well as skateboarders to a lesser extent, until users were divided into wheeled versus non-wheeled camps. It appears unlikely that a consensus will emerge over the most appropriate mode of travelling the seawall, but as long as accidents remain minimal, it is unlikely to re-emerge as a pressing park-use issue. A survey conducted for a 1992 task force on the park found that 65% of park users were opposed to the elimination of bicycle traffic from the seawall compared with 20% who favoured such a ban. Needless to say, the task force's recommendation to phase out cycling went unheeded.|$|E

500|$|In 1915, Germany {{occupied}} western {{parts of}} the Russian Empire. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Germany conceived the geopolitical strategy of Mitteleuropa – a regional network of puppet states that {{would serve as a}} buffer zone – and agreed to allow the Vilnius Conference, hoping that it would proclaim that the Lithuanian nation wanted to detach itself from Russia and establish a closer relationship with Germany. However, this strategy backfired; the conference, held from September 18–22 of 1917, adopted a resolution that an independent Lithuania should be established and that a closer relationship with Germany would be conditional on Germany's formal recognition of the new state. On September 21, the 214 attendees at the conference elected a 20-member Council of Lithuania to codify this resolution. The German authorities did not allow <b>that</b> <b>resolution</b> to be published, but they did permit the Council to proceed. The Vilnius Conference also resolved that a constituent assembly be elected [...] "in conformity with democratic principles by all the inhabitants of Lithuania".|$|E

However, critics note <b>that</b> <b>Resolution</b> 1199 was a call for cessation of hostilities and does not authorize any organization to take military action. Secretary of Defense William Cohen felt that Clark had powerful allies at the White House, such as President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who allowed him to circumvent The Pentagon in promoting his strategic ideas. Clark felt, however, {{that he was not}} being included enough in discussions with the National Command Authority, leading him to describe himself as [...] "just a NATO officer who also reported to the United States". This command conflict came to a ceremonial head when Clark was not initially invited to a summit in Washington, D.C., to commemorate NATO's 50th anniversary, despite being its supreme military commander. Clark eventually secured an invitation to the summit, but was told by Cohen to say nothing about ground troops, and Clark agreed.|$|E
500|$|The process {{leading to}} Namibia's {{independence}} began with UN General Assembly Resolution 2145 (XXI) of 27 October 1966. This {{was followed by}} the passage of UN Security Council Resolution 264, adopted on 20 March 1969. In <b>that</b> <b>resolution</b> the UN assumed direct responsibility for the territory and declared the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia illegal, calling upon the Government of South Africa to withdraw immediately. International negotiations for a peaceful solution to the Namibian problem increased. In December 1978, in what was known as the Brazzaville Protocol, South Africa, Cuba and Angola formally accepted UN Security Council Resolution 435 outlining a blueprint for Namibian independence. The protocol envisioned a phased withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola over a two-year period, set 1 April 1989 as the date for the resolution's implementation and planned to reduce South African forces in Namibia to 1,500 by June 1989. The resolution established UNTAG, approving a report by the Secretary-General and outlining its objective: [...] "the withdrawal of South Africa's illegal administration from Namibia and the transfer of power to the people of Namibia {{with the assistance of the}} United Nations". Resolution 435 authorised a total of 7,500 military personnel as UNTAG's upper limit.|$|E

500|$|After {{the last}} Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Lithuania had {{become part of}} the Russian Empire. During the 19th century, the Poles and the Lithuanians {{attempted}} to restore their independence. They rebelled during the November Uprising in 1830 and the January Uprising in 1863, but the first realistic opportunity came about during World War I. In 1915, Germany occupied Lithuania as its troops marched towards Russia. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, opportunities for independence opened up. Germany, avoiding direct annexation, tried to find a middle path that would involve some kind of union with Germany. In the light of upcoming peace negotiations with Russia, the Germans agreed to allow the Vilnius Conference, hoping that it would proclaim that the Lithuanian nation wanted to be detached from Russia and wished for a closer relationship with Germany. However, the conference, held between 18 and 23 September 1917, adopted a resolution that an independent Lithuania should be established and that a closer relationship with Germany would depend on whether it recognized the new state. On 21 September, the attendees at the conference elected a 20-member Council of Lithuania to establish this resolution. The German authorities did not allow <b>that</b> <b>resolution</b> to be published, but they did permit the council to proceed. The authorities censored the council's newspaper, Lietuvos aidas (Echo of Lithuania), preventing the council from reaching a wider public audience. The conference also resolved that a constituent assembly be elected [...] "in conformity with democratic principles by all the inhabitants of Lithuania".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club reviewed the episode positively, rating it a B. He considered the episode [...] "entertaining to watch" [...] with [...] "nifty direction from Tucker Gates", despite being formulaic {{and with the}} same problems he found in the previous episode penned by John Shiban, season three's [...] "Teso Dos Bichos". Handlen had much praise for the second half, which he noted was filled with dark humor, and featured a [...] "bizarre ending". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it a 2 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode is a disastrous combination of political commentary and stereotypical “Mexican soap opera” caricatures. Mulder and Scully {{have nothing to do}} with the resolution of the episode, and in fact, the writers fail to provide <b>that</b> <b>resolution.</b> There are some good character moments, but they are too far and few between." [...] Author Keith Topping criticized the episode in his book X-Treme Possibilities, calling it an [...] "awful episode with a heavy-handed, clod-hopping attempt at social comment that hardly sits well with the themes on display in the rest of the episode." [...] He called it the worst episode of the fourth season. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five and wrote that it was [...] "trying very hard to be clever". Despite this the two explained that [...] "if cleverness were only about intent, then we could all be geniuses". Shearman and Pearson derided the episode's use of social criticism, referring to it as [...] "rubbish [...] only works if it isn't underlined each time it's made." [...] Furthermore, the two criticized the story's [...] "Mexican soap opera" [...] style, noting that it drowned out the themes in [...] "unengaging melodrama". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. She wrote that [...] "'El Mundo Gira' is so overloaded with ideas that it falls over and can't get up".|$|E
