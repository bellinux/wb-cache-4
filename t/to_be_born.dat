5|$|According to the Harivamsa, Satyavati in her {{previous}} life was Achchhoda, {{daughter of the}} Pitrs (ancestors) and cursed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>born</b> on earth. The Mahabharata, Harivamsa and Devi Bhagavata Purana assert that Satyavati {{was the daughter of}} a cursed apsara (celestial nymph) named Adrika. Adrika was transformed by a curse into a fish, and lived in the Yamuna river.|$|E
5|$|Hagenbeck's modern zoo {{techniques}} proved effective, and Edinburgh quickly {{gained a}} reputation for its good animal conditions. 1934 saw the births in captivity of a sea lion and beaver, and in 1936 a baby chimpanzee followed. A litter of wolves was born in 1938, and soon afterwards the first orangutan <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>born</b> in Britain.|$|E

5|$|A girl born at {{the station}} in 1924 was the first baby <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>born</b> on the Underground network. The Bakerloo line {{building}} remains much as originally constructed and is a typical Leslie Green structure. The Northern line building was designed by Thomas Phillips Figgis, and was rebuilt several times until the current structure opened in 2003. Transport for London (TfL) is currently planning a major upgrade to the station. A Bakerloo line extension south to Camberwell was planned and approved in 1931 but construction never started. Similar proposals have been revived on several occasions; in 2014 TfL ran a consultation on an extension to Hayes and Beckenham Junction, which is still under consideration.|$|E
5|$|A {{traditional}} {{definition is}} {{that to be a}} Cockney, one had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>born</b> within the sound of Bow Bells, situated in Cheapside. In general, the sound pattern would cover most of the City, and parts of the near East End such as Aldgate and Whitechapel, but {{it is unlikely that the}} bells would have been heard in the docklands. In practice, with Royal London the only maternal hospital nearby, few would today be born within earshot.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} home, Houston {{negotiated}} a labor-swap arrangement with Raven Hill's overseer Captain Frank Hatch. In {{lieu of a}} cash payment for his services, the bulk of Houston's slave labor force was engaged to work on Hatch's property at Bermuda Spring. The remaining slaves were retained as house labor for Margaret. Eventually, Houston became the owner of Bermuda Spring when he and Hatch swapped properties, and he set about to build the Woodland home for his wife. The first child <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>born</b> {{in the house was}} Margaret (Maggie) Lea Houston, arriving on April 13, 1848, while Congress was in session and Houston was in Washington.|$|E

5|$|During the Fringe team's search, Fauxlivia {{finds herself}} being put under a {{treatment}} to accelerate her pregnancy, bringing her child near term. She {{is able to}} escape from her captors and contact Fringe division to identify her location, but struggles from labor pains as the child is about <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>born.</b> Henry drives Lincoln to her location, and {{they are able to}} help Fauxlivia to deliver her child, a son, before medical help arrives. Fauxlivia and her child recover under tight security ordered by Walternate, fearing for their safety. The doctors determine the accelerated pregnancy outpaced the virus, thus allowing both Fauxlivia and her child to survive.|$|E
5|$|Edmund {{was born}} either in 1015, 1016 or 1017. Edmund's mother was {{probably}} Ealdgyth, Edmund Ironside's wife; {{it is possible}} that she was only his stepmother, as the king's death in November 1016 left space of only one year for two children <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>born.</b> Although {{there is a possibility that}} Edmund was older than his brother, later known as Edward the Exile, it is also possible that they were twins. At the time, it was customary for posthumous sons to bear their father's name; thus, Edmund could have been the younger, posthumous son.|$|E
5|$|Felix Mendelssohn {{was born}} on 3 February 1809, in Hamburg, at the time an {{independent}} city-state, {{in the same house}} where, a year later, the dedicatee and first performer of his Violin Concerto, Ferdinand David, was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>born.</b> Mendelssohn's father was the banker Abraham Mendelssohn, the son of the German Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn. His mother was Lea Salomon, a member of the Itzig family and a sister of Jakob Salomon Bartholdy. Mendelssohn was the second of four children; his older sister Fanny also displayed exceptional and precocious musical talent.|$|E

5|$|Gian Gastone {{arrived in}} Tuscany, without his wife, in 1708. The Emperor, {{thinking}} {{it unlikely that}} any male heirs were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>born</b> to the Medici, prepared to occupy Tuscany, under the pretext of Medici descent. He intimated that upon the Grand Prince's death the Tuscans would rebel against Cosimo's autocratic government. Cosimo, {{in an act of}} desperation, had Francesco Maria, the Medici family cardinal, renounce his religious vows and marry Eleanor of Gonzaga, the youngest child of the incumbent Duke of Guastalla. Two years later, Francesco Maria died, taking with him any hope of an heir.|$|E
5|$|Her {{introduction}} {{makes her}} the youngest inductee {{of all time}} at age 36, breaking the record of Trish Stratus who was inducted in 2013 at age 37.

Additionally, she and her husband Edge became the first real-life couple to both be inducted.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs {{was summoned}} to Surrey for a trial in April 1903, and {{subsequently}} offered {{a contract with the}} ground staff at the Oval on a basic wage during the season of 30 shillings a week. Hobbs could not immediately play for Surrey owing to the qualification rules in place at the time for the County Championship—a player had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>born</b> in a county or to have lived there for two years in order to represent it. To achieve qualification, he moved to the Surrey area of London. Around this time he played football for local teams as a forward with some success, but struggled financially during the winter months and found it hard to find employment.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Lili's {{remnants}} brought heavy rainfall, peaking at {{four inches}} in Arkansas, to the Southeast, before dissipating near the Arkansas-Tennessee border. Lili's remnants also caused minimal rainfall in the Lower Tennessee Valley. No major damage was reported. In all, Lili caused $820 million in {{damage to the}} United States. Lili also caused a little girl <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>born</b> in Massachusetts 2 weeks before her due date. Her mother named her after the storm, Lilly. This girl has grown with the fury and intensity of this storm.|$|E
5|$|In 1768 {{the family}} finally took up {{residence}} in Steventon. Henry was the first child <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>born</b> there, in 1771. At about this time Cassandra could no longer ignore that little George was developmentally disabled. He was subject to seizures, may have been deaf and dumb, and she chose to send him out to be fostered. In 1773, Cassandra was born, followed by Francis in 1774, and Jane in 1775.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century Johann Georg Kleine, Wilhelm Busch's {{maternal}} grandfather, {{settled in the}} small village of Wiedensahl. There, in 1817, he bought a thatched half-timbered house, where Wilhelm Busch was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>born</b> about 15 years later. Amalie Kleine, Johann's wife and Wilhelm Busch's grandmother, kept a shop in which Busch's mother Henriette assisted while her two brothers attended high school. When Johann Georg Kleine died in 1820, his widow continued to run the shop with Henriette.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not always}} easy to predict a grown Appaloosa's color at birth. Foals of any breed tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>born</b> with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair. In addition, Appaloosa foals do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics. Patterns {{sometimes}} change {{over the course of the}} horse's life although some, such as the blanket and leopard patterns, tend to be stable. Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting as they get older.|$|E
5|$|Matangi {{is often}} {{associated}} with pollution, especially left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta or Ucçhishṭa, उच्छिष्ट) considered impure in Hinduism. She is often offered such polluted left-over food and is in one legend described <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>born</b> from it. Matangi is herself described as the leftover or residue, symbolizing the Divine Self that is left over after all things perish. As the patron of left-over food offerings, she embodies inauspiciousness and the forbidden transgression of social norms.|$|E
5|$|The Angel of the Lord {{stated that}} Manoah's wife was {{to abstain from}} all {{alcoholic}} beverages, and her promised child was not to shave or cut his hair. He {{was to be a}} Nazirite from birth. In ancient Israel, those wanting to be especially dedicated to God for a time could take a Nazirite vow which included abstaining from wine and spirits, not cutting hair or shaving, and other requirements. The wife believed the Angel of the Lord; her husband was not present, so he prayed and asked God to send the messenger once again to teach them how to raise the boy who was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>born.</b>|$|E
