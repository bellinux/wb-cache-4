40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. June 2013. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor:Zongxuan Sun. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 66 pages, appendix A. Automotive transmissions {{are required to}} efficiently transfer energy from the engine to the wheels. Automatic transmissions {{are one of the}} most widely used transmission systems in the United States. This <b>transmission</b> <b>houses</b> a hydraulic system which is used to actuate the clutch system to realize different gear ratios. Currently, these clutches are primarily controlled in open-loop using hydraulic valves in a physical embodiment designed specifically for a given transmission system in order to perform precise pressure and flow control. To meet the increasing demand for higher fuel economy, transmissions with greater number of gear ratios are being introduced. The hydraulic architecture is becoming increasingly complicated with more clutches and control elements. With the advancement of MEMS technology, the sensor-based direct feedback control of clutches becomes possible. This paper first analyzes the current architecture of transmission hydraulic system and then presents a new architecture for the feedback-based clutches. The proposed architecture is further validated through experiments using hardware-in-the-loop system...|$|R

50|$|Until the 1940s, plows {{and other}} tillage {{equipment}} usually {{were connected to}} the tractor via a drawbar. The classic drawbar is simply a steel bar attached to the tractor (or in some cases, as in the early Fordsons, cast {{as part of the}} rear <b>transmission</b> <b>housing)</b> to which the hitch of the implement was attached with a pin or by a loop and clevis. The implement could be readily attached and removed, allowing the tractor to be used for other purposes on a daily basis. If the tractor was equipped with a swinging drawbar, then it could be set at the center or offset from center to allow the tractor to run outside the path of the implement.|$|E

5000|$|The Generation III small block V8 engines {{offered in}} the GMT 800 trucks were {{replaced}} in the GMT 900 series by the Generation IV small block V8 engine family, featuring upgrades such as increased power and Active Fuel Management on the 5.3 L and 6.0 L V8s. A new high performance 6.2 liter V8 (with [...] and 417 lbft Nm of torque) was introduced with the 2007 Cadillac Escalade and 2007 GMC Denali line, and is now available on the Silverado LTZ trim line. After skipping the 2008 model year, with 2007 being the last for the GMT800 hybrid line, a two-mode hybrid model was introduced in late 2008 as a 2009 model.

Transmission errors and internal excitations are {{the root cause of}} vibration and noise. The main objective of this research work is weight calculation and modal analysis of gearbox housing. For weight calculation four different materials have been selected, apart from weight calculation the material mechanical properties influence on natural frequency and mode shape of <b>transmission</b> gearbox <b>housing</b> was also simulated using modal analysis. Grey cast iron FG 260, Grey cast iron HT 200, structural steel and Al alloys are the four materials used for the weight calculation process. Zero displacement constraint based boundary condition was applied for simulation. FEA based numerical simulation method was used to find the natural frequency, mode shapes and weight calculation of housing. The FEA simulation results show that the natural frequency of all materials varies (1669 - 4655) Hz. In weight calculation the weight of Al alloys housing is minimum (21. 102 kg). The housing weight of Grey cast iron HT 200 and FG 260 is same, 54. 85 kg. The density of structural steel is high, which increases the weight of housing as 59. 80 kg. The modal analysis results show the lateral vibration, axial bending vibration, torsional vibration, and axial bending with torsional vibration. The vibration signature patterns for first twenty modes were studied for four different materials. Solid Edge and Pro-E software have good feature suited for complex geometric modeling. FEA based software Ansys 14. 5 is used for modal analysis. The result of this research work has been verified with experimental result available in literature...|$|R

The lower hull rear, which protected the engine, was 38 mm thick, sloped at 0 to 22 degrees from the vertical depending upon the variant. The hull roof was 25.4 mm. The hull floor ranged from 25.4 mm thick under the driver and assistant driver's positions to 12.7 mm thick at the rear.

50|$|The {{design team}} {{set out to}} create a 6 speed {{automatic}} that fits in the same space as a manual gearbox. It measures 358 mm in length and weighs 90 kg. Its combined use of a conventional 5-pinion planetary gearset and a compound Ravigneaux gearset makes it incredibly light and compact. This combination {{is known as a}} Lepelletier arrangement. The shifting of gears is managed by a sophisticated computer programme which oversees a clutch-to-clutch actuation. Gear changes are accomplished by one clutch engaging the instant the clutch from the previous gear disengages. The transmission control module (TCM) is located inside the <b>transmission</b> <b>housing,</b> instead of being located outside it. The advantage of this is to reduce external wiring as well as to provide a constant environment for TCM operation which encourages longevity. One aspect of the advanced nature of the electronics is at idle (along with required foot brake depression on e.g. Opel Astra), it automatically selects neutral gear to reduce internal temperatures and improve fuel economy.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to {{increased interest in}} fuel economy, Dodge offered the [...] "Dart Lite" [...] fuel economy package which weighed at least 150 lb less than the ordinary Dart Sport. The 225 slant-six was the only available engine, equipped with an aluminum intake manifold {{for the first time}} since 1960 and a specially calibrated carburetor and distributor. Bumper reinforcement brackets were aluminum instead of steel, while the hood and trunk lid bracing and inner panels were also aluminum. The slant-six engine block had already been modified for reduced weight in 1975; in the middle of 1976 production its crankshaft was changed from forged steel to lighter cast iron. The high-flow exhaust system included a dual-biscuit catalytic converter, a 2¼" [...] headpipe, and the muffler used on V8 models. The Dart Lite was equipped with a 2.94:1 rear axle rather than the customary 3.21:1 ratio when the car was ordered with a three- or four-speed manual transmission. The A833OD overdrive 4-speed manual <b>transmission</b> <b>housing</b> was made of aluminum.
