From May 2015 until December 2015, to facilitate the electrification of the route from Manchester to Preston a reduced service pattern was in place as only one track through the Farnworth Tunnel could be used. During this period, many TransPennine Express services were re-routed via Wigan North Western avoiding Bolton altogether. At the weekends train services between Manchester and Bolton were replaced by buses.|$|E

50|$|In late August 2010, the {{athletic}} department revealed expansion plans for Albertsons Stadium. The first stages were to include adding a new facility to the north end zone to house the football offices, weight room, training room, equipment room and locker room. Plans also included a 13,200 seat grandstand. The later stages of the expansion plan included removal of the <b>track,</b> <b>lowering</b> of the field, and adding 3,300 seats {{in front of the}} first deck of the stadium, completion of the south end zone horseshoe, building of an east side skybox, and renovation of the east side concourse. The total cost for all planned expansions was around $100 million. The total seating capacity for a fully expanded Albertsons Stadium was estimated to be around 53,000. In April 2012, the university broke ground on a revised expansion which it hoped to complete by June 2013.|$|E

5000|$|Until the 2007 project, {{the tunnel}} {{had been a}} choke point for the {{movement}} of modern autoracks and double stack containers {{into and out of}} Vermont. The 2007 project lowered the trackage to accommodate [...] "Modified double stack containers" [...] through the tunnel, utilizing a modified design build management process to expedite the tunnel work in an efficient, cost effective, and timely manner. On Saturday, August 18 at 4:00 a.m., rail traffic on the eastern side of Vermont was shut down for three days so that the lowering of the track could occur. Crews worked 24 hours each day until the work was completed. A test train ran over the track on Monday August 20. Approximately 750 cubic yards of material was excavated from within the tunnel. Trackage was dropped about 3 feet while the lower tunnel foundation was installed with steel walls and struts in order to enable future <b>track</b> <b>lowering</b> (for full double stack clearance) without necessity of additional foundation underpinning (after the railroad adjusts the elevation of their Canal Bridge).|$|E
40|$|AbstractProjects {{to deliver}} Overhead Line Equipment (OLE) {{electrification}} on the UK rail infrastructure system presents technical challenges which the rail industry in Britain have not traditionally had to consider. Whole Life Cycle assessment provides decision makers with cost {{estimates for the}} installation phase and over the entire service life of the system, including disposal. The OLE projects face a particular problem when analysing the best option for overbridges. Much of the rail infrastructure has not traditionally had to consider overhead clearances and therefore many of the bridges are only a little taller than the rolling stock. In addition to the difficulties in assessing the Life-Cycle costs of assets that have historically been used in very limited scales, the Whole Life Cycle assessment must consider the various engineering options that are available for projects. The three competing options (bridge rebuild, <b>track</b> <b>lowering,</b> reduced clearance) {{are all going to}} have very different capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX) costs. This work presents a model created to predict these costs over the anticipated assessment period. The developed model predicts capital expenditures, maintenance and service disruption costs and links them to the three major assets options involved in OLE underbridges...|$|E
