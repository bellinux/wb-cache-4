5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in {{painting}} trends between the Northern Song period (960–1127) and Southern Song period (1127–1279). The paintings of Northern Song officials {{were influenced by}} their political ideals of bringing order {{to the world and}} tackling the largest issues affecting the whole of their society, hence their paintings often depicted huge, sweeping landscapes. On the other hand, Southern Song officials were more interested in reforming society from the bottom up and on a much smaller scale, a method they believed had a better chance for eventual success. Hence, their paintings often focused on smaller, visually closer, and more intimate scenes, while the background was often depicted as bereft of detail as a realm without substance or concern for the artist or viewer. This change in attitude from one era to the next stemmed largely from the rising influence of Neo-Confucian philosophy. Adherents to Neo-Confucianism focused on reforming society from the bottom up, not the top down, which can be seen in their efforts to promote small private academies during the Southern Song instead of the large state-controlled academies seen in the Northern Song era.|$|E

Male correlations ranged from -0.03 to 0.54. However, an interesting finding was that in the three high ability samples, there was a significant gender difference in SAT-Math scores alone. This difference favored males. In the three high ability samples, males scored higher than females in mental rotation ability. Interestingly enough, for the verbal aptitude test on SAT, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in verbal ability for the low ability college bound sample favoring girls.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between freshmen retention and selected student services in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). A review of literature revealed that student 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of student services are related to student 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in the academic and social systems of the college, which are closely and strongly linked to student retention. The results from this study will help student services 2 ̆ 7 administrators to effectively lead HBCUs in their retention efforts. This study utilized quantitative methods to determine the relationships between freshmen retention and student services. Questionnaires were administered to 2000 students enrolled in freshmen orientation classes at the sampled institutions, 1014 were returned correctly. The dependent and independent variables were analyzed using Pearson Correlation coefficient and Multiple Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) statistical tools. The 0. 05 level of significance was used to test the null hypotheses. The following are the findings of this study: 1. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between freshmen retention and enrollment management. 2. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between freshmen retention and financial assistance. 3. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between freshmen retention and residence life. 4. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between freshmen retention and extracurricular activities. 5. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between freshmen retention and counseling services. 6. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between freshmen retention and academic support services. 7. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between freshmen retention and enrollment management in terms of (a) gender, (b) institution type, and (c) socioeconomic status. 8. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between freshmen retention and financial assistance in terms of (a) gender, (b) institution type, and (c) socioeconomic status. 9. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between freshmen retention and residence life in terms of (a) gender, (b) institution type, and (c) socioeconomic status. 10. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between freshmen retention and extracurricular activities in terms of (a) gender, (b) institution type, and (c) socioeconomic status. 11. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between freshmen retention and counseling services in terms of (a) gender, (b) institution type, and (c) socioeconomic status. 12. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between freshmen retention and academic support services in terms of (a) gender, (b) institution type, and (c) socioeconomic status...|$|R
