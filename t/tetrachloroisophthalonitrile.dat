40|$|Fungi {{tolerant}} to an organochlorine fungicide, <b>tetrachloroisophthalonitrile</b> (TCPN), {{was selected}} and isolated from various soil samples, and examined for the activity to metabolize TCPN. The population of tolerant fungi was extremely {{large in the}} plastic house - soil on which TCPN {{has been used for}} six years to control diseases. This is probably due to the change of soil microflora owing to the decline of TCPN-sensitive competitors. Many tolerant fungi took up TCPN very rapidly from culture filtrate. Of ten tolerant isolates tested, two isolates, C-F- I and V-P- 5, were found to metabolize TCPN. The metabolite was isolated in pure form by preparative TLC, and identified as trichloroisophthalonitrile by mass spectrometry. C-F- 1 was identified as Aspergillus luchuensis and V-P- 5 as Penicillium godlewskii. Namely, these soil fungi dechlorinate from tetrachloroisophthalontrile to trichloroisophthalonitrile...|$|E
40|$|Creeping bentgrass [Agrostis stolonifera L. var. palustris (Huds.) Farw. ] and {{perennial}} ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) are commonly grown fairway grasses that {{are susceptible to}} dollar spot (Sclerotinia homoeocarpa F. T. Bennett; DS) and gray leaf spot [Pyricularia grisea (Cooke) Sacc; GLS. ] diseases, respectively. This field study assessed the influence of two irrigation regimes (light and frequent nighttime versus deep and infrequentmorning irrigation) and six chem-ical treatments including: chlorothalonil (<b>tetrachloroisophthalonitrile),</b> paclobutrazol [(2 RS, 3 RS) - 1 -(4 -chlorophenyl) - 4, 4 -dimethyl- 2 -(1 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 1 -yl) pentan- 3 -ol; PB], wetting agent (polymeric poly-oxyalkylene 95 % oxoalkonyl hydroxyl polyoxlalkane diyl 5 %; WA), chlorothalonil 1 PB, chlorothalonil 1 WA and chlorothalonil 1 PB 1 WA on DS and GLS severity over a 3 -yr period.

40|$|Current {{vegetable}} {{production systems}} use polyethylene (plastic) mulch and require multiple applications of agrochemicals. During rain events, runoff from vegetable production is enhanced because 50 to 75 % {{of the field}} is covered with an impervious surface. This {{study was conducted to}} quantify off-site movement of soil and pesticides with runoff from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mil.) plots containing polyethylene mulch and a vegetative mulch, hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth). Side-by-side field plots were instrumented with automated flow meters and samplers to measure and collect runoff, which was filtered, extracted, and analyzed to determine soil and pesticide loss. Seasonal losses of two to four times more water and at least three times as much sediment were observed from plots with polyethylene mulch (55. 4 to 146 L m- 2 and 247 to 535 g m- 2, respectively) versus plots with hairy vetch residue (13. 7 to 75. 7 L m- 2 and 32. 8 to 118 g m- 2, respectively). Geometric means (±standard deviation) of total pesticide loads for chlorothalonil (<b>tetrachloroisophthalonitrile)</b> and α- and β-endosulfan (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10 -hexachloro- 1, 5, 5 a, 6, 9, 9 a-hexahydro- 6, 9 -methano- 2, 4, 3 -benzodioxathiepin 3 -oxide) for a runoff event were 19, 6, and 9 times greater from polyethylene (800 ± 4. 6, 17. 6 ± 3. 9, and 39. 1 ± 4. 9 μg m- 2, respectively) than from hairy vetch mulch plots (42 ± 6. 0, 2. 8 ± 5. 0, and 4. 3 ± 4. 6 μg m- 2, respectively) due to greater concentrations and larger runoff volumes. The increased runoff volume, soil loss, and off-site loading of pesticides measured in runoff from the polyethylene mulch suggests that this management practice is less sustainable and may have a harmful effect on the environment...|$|E
40|$|Though many {{fungicide}} {{applications are}} made {{on a golf course}} in a year, little consideration is given to possible non-target effects of fungicides on turfgrasses. Since non-target effects are usually subtle and inconsistent, these effects must be better understood to use fungicides safely and effectively. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of four fungicides on creeping bentgrass (Agrostis palustris Huds.) growth and performance. Our hypothesis was that fungicides applied repeatedly and/or at high rates would negatively affect creeping bentgrass growth and/or water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) status. Fungicides used were benomyl (methyl- 1 -(butylcarbamoyl) - 2 -benzimidazolecarbamate), chlorothalonil (<b>tetrachloroisophthalonitrile),</b> iprodione(3 -(3, 5 -dichlorophenyl) -N-(1 -methylethyl) - 2, 4 -dioxo- 1 -imidazolidinecarboximide), and propiconazole (1 -(2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 4 -propyl- 1, 3 -dioxolan- 2 -ylmethyl) - 1 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazole). Single applications of fungicides at recommended rates had no negative side effects {{at any time during the}} studies. All applications of propiconazole consistently caused creeping bentgrass to turn dark green in all studies. Benomyl applied once at 1 X, 3 X, and 9 X the recommended rate increased shoot growth in the greenhouse. Chlorothalonil, iprodione, and propiconazole reduced plant weights and iprodione and propiconazole 3 X reduced WSC in the greenhouse. Repeated applications of propiconazole increased root-to-shoot ratios in the growth chamber. Nine applications of benomyl, chlorothalonil, and propiconazole over a four week period decreased growth whereas, nine applications of benomyl, iprodione, and propiconazole decreased WSC concentrations in the growth chamber. In a field study, 16 applications of fungicides in each of three years had few significant effects on a creeping bentgrass putting green. Fungicide treatments slightly improved rooting in the last year of the study. Propiconazole consistently decreased visual quality but improved color and increased shoot growth. Propiconazole increased snow mold incidence one spring. Three years of chlorothalonil or benomyl applications reduced earthworm populations. If turf is managed properly and fungicides are applied judiciously and at recommended rates, there are few negative non-target effects of fungicides on creeping bentgrass growth and performance. ...|$|E
