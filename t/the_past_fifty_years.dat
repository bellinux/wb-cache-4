5|$|There {{are several}} checks and {{balances}} built into the state constitution that limit {{the power of the}} General Assembly. Other clauses allow the General Assembly to balance and limit the authority of the other branches of the government. Among these {{checks and balances}} is the governor's authority to veto any bill passed by the General Assembly. The General Assembly may in turn override his veto by simple majority vote in both houses. Bills passed by a super majority automatically become law without requiring the signature of the governor. Once the bill is made law, it can be challenged in the state courts which may rule the law to be unconstitutional, effectively repealing the law. The General Assembly could then override the court's decision by amending the state constitution to include the law. The General Assembly has historically been the most powerful branch of the state government, dominating a weak governor's office. Although the governor has gained more power in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>fifty</b> <b>years,</b> the General Assembly still retains the power to remove much of that authority.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{strengthening}} of democratic governance institutions {{is a key}} factor for any development initiative. With these institutions in place, accountability becomes a yardstick to achieve greater results. This article therefore set out to explore the impact that decentralisation has on Public Enterprises. Decentralisation being an instrument of good governance, the article want to investigate if it applicability on state own enterprises could stimulate economic development. A policy of decentralisation could be considered as an important tool for economic development if the process is adequately implemented. Public enterprises {{were put in place}} in many countries to contribute to social development. However, past studies have shown that, public enterprises have not performed well over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>fifty</b> <b>year</b> or so. Many failed because of lack of transparency and accountability. The central question around the thesis is why these public enterprises did not achieve the required results for which they created and what is needed for corrective actions. The article concludes by proposing that, In order to ensure sustainability and economic expediency, {{it is important to consider}} decentralisation as a condition for public enterprises to achieve developmental results. The paper is divided into five major parts: The first part introduces the topic, the second part argues about the rationale of decentralisation for the sustainability of public enterprises...|$|R
40|$|Over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>fifty</b> <b>year,</b> lasers {{have found}} many, often {{groundbreaking}} applications {{in science and}} technology. The most important features of lasers are that photons are inherently free of contamination, extremely high energy densities can be focused in very small areas and the laser beam can be precisely positioned using deflection mirrors. By reducing pulse lengths from a few nanoseconds down to the picosecond or femtosecond range, material ablation is becoming increasingly "a thermal", i. e. structure damage by local heating is reduced to well below a few microns. In view of these outstanding characteristics of lasers, it is very surprising that sample preparation for microstructure diagnostics did not derive the advantages from laser micro-machining. microPREP, is a new laser-micromachining tool developed by 3 D-Micromac capable of making fast, clean, and efficient laser ablation available for the preparation of samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The workflow follows a three-stage approach. First, a supporting basic structure is cut from the feedstock. Second, the supported structure is laser-thinned down to a few microns and third, the supported and laser-thinned structure is thinned using a focused ion beam or an ion broad beam. The examples {{presented in this paper}} support this approach and show it is ready to be applied in different areas of microstructure diagnostics and has very high potential for failure diagnostics...|$|R

50|$|Once the {{organism}} has perished, {{part of the}} siliceous skeletal material dissolves, as it settles through the water column, enriching the deep waters with dissolved silica. Some of the siliceous scales can also be preserved over time as microfossils in deep-sea sediments, providing a window into modern and ancient plankton/protists communities. This biologic process has operated, since at least early Paleozoic time, to regulate the balance of silica in the ocean: Radiolarians (Cambrian/Ordovician-Holocene), diatoms (Cretaceous-Holocene), and silicoflagellates (Cretaceous-Holocene) form the ocean’s main contributors to the global silica biogenic cycle throughout geologic time. Diatoms account for 43% of the ocean primary production, and {{are responsible for the}} bulk of silica extraction from ocean waters in the modern ocean, and during much of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>fifty</b> million <b>years.</b> In contrast, oceans of Jurassic and older ages, were characterized by radiolarians as major silica-utilizing phyla.

In equatorial Pacific waters, for example, about 16,000 specimens per cubic meter can be observed.|$|R

40|$|How animals, {{including}} mammals, {{can respond}} to and utilize the direction and intensity of the Earth’s magnetic field for orientation and navigation is contentious. In this study, we ex-perimentally tested whether the Chinese Noctule, Nyctalus plancyi (Vespertilionidae) can sense magnetic field strengths that were even {{lower than those of}} the present-day geomag-netic field. Such field strengths occurred during geomagnetic excursions or polarity rever-sals and thus may have {{played an important role in}} the evolution of a magnetic sense. We found that in a present-day local geomagnetic field, the bats showed a clear preference for positioning themselves at the magnetic north. As the field intensity decreased to only 1 / 5 th of the natural intensity (i. e., 10 μT; the lowest field strength tested here), the bats still re-sponded by positioning themselves at the magnetic north. When the field polarity was artifi-cially reversed, the bats still preferred the new magnetic north, even at the lowest field strength tested (10 μT), despite the fact that the artificial field orientation was opposite to the natural geomagnetic field (P< 0. 05). Hence, N. plancyi is able to detect the direction of a magnetic field even at 1 / 5 th of the present-day field strength. This high sensitivity to mag-netic fields may explain how magnetic orientation could have evolved in bats even as the Earth’s magnetic field strength varied and the polarity reversed tens of times over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>fifty</b> million <b>years...</b>|$|R
