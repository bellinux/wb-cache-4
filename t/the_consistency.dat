5|$|FreeBSD {{has several}} unique {{features}} related to storage. Soft updates can protect <b>the</b> <b>consistency</b> of the UFS filesystem (widely {{used on the}} BSDs) {{in the event of}} a system crash. Filesystem snapshots allow an image of a UFS filesystem at an instant in time to be efficiently created. Snapshots allow reliable backup of a live filesystem. GEOM is a modular framework that provides RAID (levels 0, 1, 3 currently), full disk encryption, journaling, concatenation, caching, and access to network-backed storage. GEOM allows building of complex storage solutions combining ("chaining") these mechanisms.|$|E

Jagannadh did not cast Brahmanandam and Ali because of Mahesh's specific characterisation; he added that Mahesh's voice had changed when compared to his performance in Pokiri. Mahesh also convinced Jagannadh to give up smoking, since he himself was trying to give up after being a chain smoker.|$|E
40|$|Many {{consistency}} criteria {{have been}} considered in databases and <b>the</b> causal <b>consistency</b> is one of them. <b>The</b> causal <b>consistency</b> model has gained much attention in recent years because it provides ordering of relative operations. <b>The</b> causal <b>consistency</b> requires that all writes, which are potentially causally related, must {{be seen in the}} same order by all processes. <b>The</b> causal <b>consistency</b> is a weaker criteria than <b>the</b> sequential <b>consistency,</b> because there exists an execution, which is causally consistent but not sequentially consistent, however all executions satisfying <b>the</b> sequential <b>consistency</b> are also causally consistent. Furthermore, <b>the</b> causal <b>consistency</b> supports non-blocking operations; i. e. processes may complete read or write operations without waiting for global computation. Therefore, <b>the</b> causal <b>consistency</b> overcomes <b>the</b> primary limit of stronger criteria: communication latency. Additionally, several application semantics are precisely captured by <b>the</b> causal <b>consistency,</b> e. g. collaborative tools. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art of causal consistent databases, discuss the features, functionalities and applications of <b>the</b> causal <b>consistency</b> model, and systematically compare it with other consistency models. We also discuss the implementation of causal consistency databases and identify limitations of <b>the</b> causal <b>consistency</b> model.

At Constantinople, on one occasion, not a few Manicheans, after strict inquisition, were executed in the emperor's very presence: some by burning, others by drowning.|$|E

5|$|An emaki of Murasaki Shikibu's diary is {{mentioned}} in the Meigetsuki ("Record of the clean moon"), the diary of the poet and scholar Fujiwara no Teika. According to this document, in 1233 several aristocrats close to cloistered Emperor Go-Horikawa planned {{to create a new}} emaki of The Tale of Genji (after the 12th century Genji Monogatari Emaki, the best known of these works), accompanied by another of Murasaki's diary. However, there is no conclusive evidence that the extant scrolls correspond to those mentioned by Fujiwara no Teika, even though <b>the</b> <b>consistency</b> of manufacturing dates suggests that this is the case.

5|$|The maximum spacing {{estimator}} is {{a consistent}} estimator {{in that it}} converges in probability to the true value of the parameter, θ0, as the sample size increases to infinity. <b>The</b> <b>consistency</b> of maximum spacing estimation holds under much more general conditions than for maximum likelihood estimators. In particular, {{in cases where the}} underlying distribution is J-shaped, maximum likelihood will fail where MSE succeeds. An example of a J-shaped density is the Weibull distribution, specifically a shifted Weibull, with a shape parameter less than 1. The density will tend to infinity as x approaches the location parameter rendering estimates of the other parameters inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|The number 1,207 appears {{very early}} in the {{historical}} record (472 BC), and the Greeks appear to have genuinely believed they faced that many ships. Because of <b>the</b> <b>consistency</b> in the ancient sources, some modern historians are inclined to accept 1,207 as the size of the initial Persian fleet; others reject this number, with 1,207 being seen as more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliad, and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean. However, very few appear to accept that there were this many ships at Salamis: most favour a number in the range 600-800. This is also the range given by adding the approximate number of Persian ships after Artemisium (~550) to the reinforcements (120) quantified by Herodotus.|$|E
