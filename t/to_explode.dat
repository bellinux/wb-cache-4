5|$|Ironically, Bawdsey {{was ignored}} by the Germans for the entire war, while St Athan was {{attacked}} by a Junkers Ju 88 only weeks after the team arrived. The single bomb struck the runway directly, but failed <b>to</b> <b>explode.</b>|$|E
5|$|The game's ending changes {{depending}} on whether the player has a radio beacon to call for extraction, and when the nuclear device is set <b>to</b> <b>explode.</b> Forgetting to set the bomb, or setting it <b>to</b> <b>explode</b> at any time past the awakening of the dreaming god, results in Earth's destruction. The device's detonation before the player reaches a minimum safe distance results in a pyrrhic victory. The most favorable endings are achieved by leaving the pyramid with a beacon for evacuation at least twenty game minutes before the device is set to go off; if the game ends with enough time for the player to escape on foot, the player survives without a beacon.|$|E
5|$|For four months, negotiators {{shuttled}} between Vienna and Berlin, Dresden and Regensburg, and Zweibrücken, Munich and Mannheim. By {{early spring}} 1778, Austria and Prussia {{faced each other}} with armies several {{times the size of}} their forces during the Seven Years' War, and their confrontation had the potential <b>to</b> <b>explode</b> into another European-wide war.|$|E

50|$|The mine shafts are {{populated}} by spiders, bats and other unknown creatures that are deadly to the touch; these creatures can be destroyed using the laser, or {{will also be}} destroyed if they are close <b>to</b> <b>exploding</b> dynamite.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the oldest}} pieces of tornado {{folklore}} {{is the idea that}} tornadoes do most of their damage due to the lower atmospheric pressure {{at the center of a}} tornado, which causes the house <b>to</b> <b>explode</b> outward. As the theory goes, opening windows helps to equalize the pressure.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese combat air patrol, flying Mitsubishi A6M2 Zeros, made short {{work of the}} unescorted, slow, under-armed TBDs. A few TBDs {{managed to}} get within a few ship-lengths range of their targets before {{dropping}} their torpedoes—close {{enough to be able}} to strafe the enemy ships and force the Japanese carriers to make sharp evasive maneuvers—but all of their torpedoes either missed or failed <b>to</b> <b>explode.</b> Remarkably, senior Navy and Bureau of Ordnance officers never questioned why half a dozen torpedoes, released so close to the Japanese carriers, produced no results. The abysmal performance of American torpedoes in the early months of the war became a scandal. Torpedo after torpedo either missed by running directly under the target, prematurely exploded, or struck targets with textbook right angle hits (sometimes with an audible clang) and failed <b>to</b> <b>explode.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{does not}} have enough mass <b>to</b> <b>explode</b> as a supernova. Instead it will exit the main {{sequence}} in approximately 5 billion years and start to turn into a red giant. As a red giant, the Sun will grow so large that it will engulf Mercury, Venus, and probably Earth.|$|E

5000|$|Blocks: These do not ignite explosions, but {{participate}} in them if {{the color is}} right. Blocks will only <b>explode</b> if next <b>to</b> <b>exploding</b> pieces of the same color. Blocks {{can be used to}} separate Ka-Gloms to architect bigger explosions and get higher scores.|$|R
50|$|The {{statistics}} of this report, however, {{have been the}} subject of some dispute. The V-1 missiles launched from bombers were often prone <b>to</b> <b>exploding</b> prematurely, occasionally resulting in the loss of the aircraft to which they were attached. The Luftwaffe lost 77 aircraft out of 1,200 of these types of sorties.|$|R
5|$|The stolen Ford Escort {{belonged to}} a man from Portadown, who {{according}} to Captain Fred Holroyd, had links {{with one of the}} UVF bombers and the driver of the bomb car which had been left <b>to</b> <b>explode</b> in Parnell Street, Dublin on 17 May 1974. He {{was also one of the}} prime suspects in the sectarian killing of Dorothy Traynor on 1 April 1975 in Portadown.|$|E
5|$|After Cersei {{fails to}} appear, Lancel Lannister {{is sent to}} {{retrieve}} her. Lancel follows one of Cersei's spies beneath the Sept, and finds a wildfire cache about <b>to</b> <b>explode.</b> He is stabbed in the spine before he can disarm the cache. Inside the Sept, Margaery Tyrell, realizing that Cersei has set a trap, warns the crowd to leave, but the High Sparrow prevents anyone from leaving. The wildfire ignites and destroys the Great Sept, killing everyone inside. King Tommen Baratheon witnesses the explosion from the Red Keep and commits suicide by jumping out a window.|$|E
5|$|After {{putting on}} the crown, Finn becomes {{corrupted}} by its power, going mad. He attacks the Destiny Gang—who his family owed a debt as established in the previous episode—and put out the fires that they started, but his uncontrolled power causes the mutagenic bomb that Simon stopped <b>to</b> <b>explode,</b> destroying the surrounding area. Jake, however, falls into a mutagenic puddle and is mutated into a creature similar to the Lich, which attacks Finn.|$|E
50|$|Xenon tetroxide is a {{chemical}} compound of xenon and oxygen with molecular formula XeO4, remarkable {{for being a}} relatively stable compound of a noble gas. It is a yellow crystalline solid that is stable below −35.9 °C; above that temperature it is very prone <b>to</b> <b>exploding</b> and decomposing into elemental xenon and oxygen (O2).|$|R

5|$|Scientists {{estimate}} that a tropical cyclone releases heat energy {{at the rate}} of 50 to 200 exajoules (1018 J) per day, equivalent to about 1PW (1015watt). This rate of energy release is equivalent to 70 times the world energy consumption of humans and 200 times the worldwide electrical generating capacity, or <b>to</b> <b>exploding</b> a 10-megaton nuclear bomb every 20minutes.|$|R
5|$|After the mission, it is {{revealed}} that Sawamura planned to collect bribes from Megatech {{in exchange for}} covering up a defect in the nuclear reactor, which was going <b>to</b> <b>explode,</b> and presenting it as a terrorist attack; however, Zebra seized the reactor to take it over and wanted to extort money from Sawamura. Kusanagi declares the entire experience as at least good training for the Rookie and acknowledges the Rookie's cleverness, but criticizes the overdependence on the Fuchikoma.|$|E
5|$|All three {{ships were}} {{fitted with a}} shallow anti-torpedo bulge {{integral}} to the hull which was intended <b>to</b> <b>explode</b> the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and vent the underwater explosion to the surface rather than into the ship. However, later testing proved {{that it was not}} deep enough to accomplish its task as it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force of the explosion.|$|E
5|$|At 14:47, an unexploded 24-cm shell was reported. The shell {{crashed through}} the port bow {{directly}} below the Wardroom {{and entered the}} stateroom of Warrant Officer M.A. Clark, but failed <b>to</b> <b>explode.</b> The unexploded shell was later disarmed by a Navy bomb disposal officer in Portsmouth and is currently displayed aboard the ship. Throughout the three-hour duel, the Germans straddled and near-missed Texas over sixty-five times, but she continued her mission firing 206 14-inch shells at Battery Hamburg until ordered to retire at 15:01.|$|E

5|$|At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien {{inhabitant}} of the Moon, {{named after}} one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the astronomers and take them to the palace of their king. An astronomer lifts the Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him <b>to</b> <b>explode.</b>|$|E
5|$|Billy and Kathy {{attend a}} pool party where Chuck and Froggy attempt to rape Kathy. When Billy discovers them, a fight breaks out but Kathy stops it; knowing Chuck and Froggy would outmatch Billy. Later that night, Billy uses the laser cannon <b>to</b> <b>explode</b> Chuck's car, and Chuck and Froggy barely escape the {{explosion}} alive. Government official Tony Craig arrives to investigate both the explosion and the desert where Billy found the cannon. Tony informs the local sheriff {{that the town}} must be sealed off.|$|E
5|$|Bond infiltrates the circus, {{and finds}} that Orlov {{replaced}} the Soviet treasures {{with a nuclear}} warhead, primed <b>to</b> <b>explode</b> at a US Air Force base in West Germany. The explosion would trigger Europe into seeking disarmament, {{in the belief that}} the bomb was an American one that was detonated by accident, leaving the West's borders open to Soviet invasion. Bond deactivates the warhead and then he returns to India, joining an assault on Khan's palace.|$|E

5000|$|After trials on the Great Western Railway in 1861 and in London in 1862, the {{locomotive}} {{was considered a}} failure; on its first trial it was near <b>to</b> <b>exploding,</b> and problems with steaming and pressure retention were never overcome. The locomotive was sold in 1865 with the intention to convert it into a conventional steam engine, but it was quietly scrapped in 1895.|$|R
5|$|The {{impactor}} returned {{images as}} late as three seconds before impact. Most of the data captured was stored on board the flyby spacecraft, which radioed approximately 4,500 images from the HRI, MRI, and ITS cameras to Earth {{over the next few}} days. The energy from the collision was similar in size <b>to</b> <b>exploding</b> five tons of dynamite and the comet shone six times brighter than normal.|$|R
5|$|Commander David W. Bagley, the destroyer's commander, {{ordered all}} life rafts and boats launched. As the ship sank, her bow {{raised in the}} air almost {{vertically}} before she began to slip beneath the waves. At this point the armed depth charges began <b>to</b> <b>explode,</b> killing a number of {{men who had been}} unable to escape the destroyer, and stunning many others in the water. The destroyer, the first United States destroyer ever lost to enemy action, sank eight minutes after the torpedo struck the rudder, taking with her two officers and 64 men.|$|E
5|$|Flare: The {{earliest}} recorded use of gunpowder for signalling purposes was the 'signal bomb' {{used by the}} Song Dynasty Chinese as the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty besieged Yangzhou in 1276. These soft-shelled bombs, timed <b>to</b> <b>explode</b> in mid-air, {{were used}} to send messages to a detachment of troops far in the distance. Another mention of the signal bomb appears in a text dating from 1293 requesting their collection from those still stored in Zhejiang. A signal gun appears in Korea by 1600. The Wu I Thu Phu Thung Chih or Illustrated Military Encyclopedia written in 1791 depicts a signal gun in an illustration.|$|E
5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green {{sky with}} tornadoes, {{and though the}} phenomenon {{may be associated with}} severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, {{it is unlikely that the}} pressure drop would be enough to cause the house <b>to</b> <b>explode.</b> Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.|$|E
