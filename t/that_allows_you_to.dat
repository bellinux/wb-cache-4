25|$|The {{prototype}} bus {{was equipped}} with an innovative system of Bombardier PRIMOVE, allowing inductive charging without connecting cables. The drive system uses an electric drive system by Vossloh Kiepe GmbH made in Düsseldorf. The motor was centrally mounted by 4 poles with the asynchronous motor which has a maximum power output of 160kW (1400 Nm) and allows the use of standard axles: ZF AV 132, and the independently sprung axle ZF RL 75 EC. Energy recovered during braking is stored in the lithium-ion batteries with a capacity of 210 kWh. The vehicle is also equipped with a plug-in connector <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> connect additional to an external energy source. All devices in the vehicle, which are usually powered by a diesel engine have been electrified. The air conditioning system has a built-Konvekta UL500EM CO2 heat pump, which is also used for heating the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Holoxica has successfuly {{demonstrated}} {{several generations}} of holographic video displays. The technical approach advocates a simplified approach by starting with basic building blocks and scaling towards higher resolution and performance. The first-generation holographic display demonstrator, built in 2010, had up to nine voxels and could show simple numeric information, icons, symbology etc. This technology {{can be used to}} build segmented 3D displays, similar to the early segmented LCDs found in calculators and clocks. The second-generation display was announced in 2013. This is a planar Head-Up Display (HUD) with hundreds of thousands voxels and freeform images floating in mid-air that can change in real time. Interactivity is added with a Kinect motion sensor <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> 'touch' icons in free space and 'draw' in mid-air. The third generation display builds upon the previous generations to create a volumetric display. The images are bright and visible under indoor lighting conditions, and the approach is scalable, leveraging existing manufacturing techniques and components.|$|E

[...] "Morrowind does have numerous drawbacks .... But they're all generally minor enough that most anyone {{should be able to}} look past them ....

In 2011, Steorn's website was updated to suggest that the Orbo is based on magnetic fields which vary over time. Barry Williams of the Australian Skeptics has pointed out that Steorn is [...] "not the first company to claim they have suddenly discovered the miraculous property of magnetism <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> get free energy" [...] while Martin Fleischmann says that it is not credible that positioning of magnetic fields could create energy.|$|E
500|$|Particularly {{for smaller}} indie developers, {{the nature of}} the procedural-generated world allows teams to deliver many hours worth of game content without having to spend {{resources}} and development time on fleshing out detailed worlds. This also allows developers to devote more time in building out complex gameplay features and their interacting systems {{that are part of the}} enjoyment of roguelike and roguelike-like games. McMillen of The Binding of Isaac stated that incorporating roguelike elements into other game genres can be difficult due to overcoming the complex interfaces roguelikes tend to have, but once a means to do so is found, [...] "it becomes an increasingly beautiful, deep, and everlasting design <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> generate a seemingly dynamic experience for players, so that each time they play your game they're getting a totally new adventure".|$|E

[...] During the tour in support of Freaky Styley, Slovak's health began to deteriorate. Slovak and Flea would wrestle regularly on tour, but Slovak became too weak to participate.

500|$|After the reveal of the film's full cast, many {{outlets and}} fans began {{referring}} to the film as [...] "Avengers 2.5", given the variety and ensemble nature of the cast, usually reserved for the Avengers films, {{and the fact that}} the film no longer felt like a Captain America-centric one, as with The Winter Soldier. In response to this, Feige said, [...] "What's fun about Civil War though is, as you know from the comics, it's a very simple story. And it really has to be, to accommodate that many players. It's very much a Captain America movie and it's very much a sequel to the Winter Soldier in ways I don't think people .... It's a very simple structure <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> have these amazing character interactions in a way that I don't think becomes overwhelming." [...] Feige also revealed that Hope van Dyne / Wasp was in an original draft of the film, after receiving the Wasp costume at the end of Ant-Man, but was cut because [...] "there are so many characters in Civil War that we didn't want to do her a disservice," [...] saying Marvel was [...] "saving" [...] the character for a better environment to reveal van Dyne in the Wasp costume for the first time and see [...] "her dynamic with Scott [...] in a way it could play out".|$|E
