5|$|Initial {{efforts in}} 1995 by Navy and NOAA divers {{to raise the}} warship's {{propeller}} were foiled by an abnormally stormy season off Cape Hatteras. Realizing that raising the whole wreck was impractical for financial reasons {{as well as the}} inability <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> wreck intact, NOAA developed a comprehensive plan to recover the most significant parts of the ship, namely her engine, propeller, guns, and turret. It estimated that the plan would cost over 20 million dollars to implement over four years. The Department of Defense Legacy Resource Management Program contributed $14.5 million. The Navy divers, mainly from its two Mobile Diving and Salvage Units, would perform the bulk of the work necessary in order to train in deep sea conditions and evaluate new equipment.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the famous}} Modernist writers who {{spent time in}} Paris, Ernest Hemingway never made an {{appearance}} at the salon. James Joyce came once or twice but didn't care for it. Marcel Proust never attended a Friday, though he did come to 20, Rue Jacob once to talk with Barney about lesbian culture whilst doing research for In Search of Lost Time. His visit was delayed repeatedly owing to his poor health, and when the meeting finally did happen he was too nervous <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> subject {{he had come to}} talk about.|$|E
5|$|Once the Alien and Sedition Acts were passed, the Federalists {{pushed for}} this letter to be {{printed in the}} Vermont Journal, which Spooner did, thus adding {{additional}} charges against Lyon. One other charge included publishing letters written by the poet Joel Barlow, which Lyon had read at political rallies. These also were published prior to the Acts. Lyon's defense {{was to be the}} unconstitutionality of the Acts, as Jeffersonians saw them as violating the First Amendment to the Constitution. In Lyon's particular case, there was the aforementioned letter to Alden Spooner {{as well as that of}} Barlow, which meant Lyon felt entitled <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Constitution's safeguards against ex post facto laws. This defense was not allowed.|$|E

Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is tasked with {{tracking}} down Robert at a squash court and intercepting the emails before California {{has a chance to}} view them, while Andy, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) head to Schrute Farms, ostensibly to try and change Dwight's mind. However, Pam consistently silences any attempt <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> device, saying she knows Dwight and is confident that he will stop the device on his own. After complimenting Dwight numerous times and having a small meal, Pam makes a joke that emphasizes that everyone is human and makes mistakes.|$|E
5|$|Equality {{in matters}} of public employment: Article 16 of the {{constitution}} lays down that the State cannot discriminate against anyone in the matters of employment. All citizens can apply for government jobs. There are some exceptions. The Parliament may enact a law stating that certain jobs can be filled only by applicants who are domiciled in the area. This may be meant for posts that require knowledge of the locality and language of the area. The State may also reserve posts for members of backward classes, scheduled castes or scheduled tribes which are not adequately represented in the services under the State <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> weaker sections of the society. Also, there a law may be passed that requires that the holder of an office of any religious institution shall also be a person professing that particular religion. According to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2003, this right shall not be conferred to Overseas citizens of India.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Gellibrand {{founded the}} Remembrance Club in Hobart, {{with the aim}} of {{encouraging}} returned servicemen in business. Savige visited Gellibrand in Hobart during August 1923, and Gellibrand urged him to set up a similar club in Melbourne. Soon after Savige's return to Melbourne, a group of ex-servicemen met to say farewell to one of their number who was about to go to England. Savige used this opportunity <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> idea of a club similar to Gellibrand's Remembrance Club. After several informal meetings, the Melbourne club's inaugural meeting was held in Anzac House, Melbourne. Legacy Australia was founded as an ex-servicemen's club, but soon became a charitable organisation focusing on war widows and orphans. For the next 26years, due to his commitment, energy and enthusiasm, Savige's name became inseparable from both the club and the movement.|$|E

In 1966 she founded the University Women's Chorus (which she soon opened to non-graduates; for many years it {{has been called the}} Peninsula Women's Chorus), stressing the value of discipline and learning by insisting that performers worked from memory, even when singing in foreign languages. Both Marge and Bob, in their respective spheres, placed as much emphasis on enjoyment and sociability as on achievement, and the Chorus still maintains a tradition of parties each spring.|$|R

5|$|Johnson then removed Hutton for 57 {{without further}} {{addition}} to the total, caught by Bradman on the run, leaving England at 129/2. The Yorkshire batsman went for a lofted shot and mistimed it {{high in the air}} after being beaten in flight, and the Australian captain ran backwards from mid-on to complete the catch. This meant the two new batsmen at the crease, Edrich and Compton, were still yet to score, and the second new ball was only six overs away, so they had to preserve their wickets while conditions were at their most favourable for Australia's fast bowlers. During a slow period in which only 15 runs came in half an hour, Edrich and Compton were pinned down by defensive field settings with no slips in place. After 45 minutes, Compton premeditated a charge down the pitch and hit Johnson to the leg side for a boundary. The pair accelerated, Compton taking risks in cutting Johnson against the spin. Australia took the new ball and each batsman hit a boundary <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> fifty partnership, which took an hour. Worried by the substantial and hazardous craters he and the other bowlers had created in the pitch while following through on the left-hand side of the crease, Lindwall changed to bowling from around the wicket and was warned by umpire Baldwin for running on the pitch, before reverting to over the wicket, although he delivered {{from the edge of the}} crease to avoid the holes. O'Reilly said Baldwin's warning to Lindwall had played into Australia's hands as the bowler's follow through from around the wicket was accentuating a rough patch outside the right-hander's off stump, which the English bowlers could target when Bradman's men had to chase the target. Compton then hit boundaries with hooks and pulls from Lindwall and Johnston and England went to tea at 209/2. Compton was on 42 and Edrich 33.|$|E

25|$|In 1563 William Cecil {{drafted a}} bill, envisaging the Privy Council having wide powers if the Queen died without an heir; {{but he did}} not put it forward.

India were bowled out for 100, and had lost 7 wickets in 16 overs, for the addition of 25 runs. England won the match by 212 runs, and had levelled the series.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Franco-Batavian {{forces on}} the North Holland front were being reinforced. General Brune brought up a French {{division}} under General Dominique Vandamme and ordered General Dumonceau <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> main part of his 2nd Batavian division in forced marches from Friesland. The latter arrived on 9 September at Alkmaar. The Franco-Batavian army now had about 25,000 men available against about 20,000 for the British. In view of this numerical superiority, {{and the fact that}} reinforcements for the British were expected any day, Brune decided to attack Abercromby's position.|$|E
25|$|Taylor and Marsh {{went on the}} attack, {{sensing the}} {{possibility}} of a humiliating 10 wicket victory. However it was not to be. They made a solid opening stand of 62, but Marsh mistimed Emburey to be caught by Robinson for 31. That left Boon to come in, and he and Taylor mopped up the last few runs. Boon swept Nick Cook to the square leg boundary for four <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> winning runs, and Australia had regained the Ashes by taking an unassailable 3-0 lead with only two tests remaining to be played. Geoff Lawson's match figures of 9 for 153 earned him the man-of-the-match award.|$|E
25|$|On 21 August, {{after the}} Norwegian divers {{confirmed}} {{that no one}} was alive in the ninth compartment, the Chief of Staff of the Russian Northern Fleet, Mikhail Motsak, announced to the public that the Kursk was flooded and all of its crewmembers had died. Additional plans were made to continue to remove the bodies, but the Russian Navy could not agree on a contract with a foreign company, and the families of those who died on the submarine protested that they did not want additional lives put at risk <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> dead. On 22 August, President Putin issued an executive order declaring 23 August a day of mourning.|$|E

25|$|By 2003 {{there was}} a {{gathering}} momentum behind the possibility of Yudhoyono being a presidential candidate. The United Democratic Nationhood Party (PPDK) was the first <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> subject of nomination. In September 2003, Yudhoyono's own party began to make preparations in case Yudhoyono was willing to accept a presidential nomination. The Democratic Party then initiated a publicity campaign to promote Yudhoyono as a candidate. For his part, Yudhoyono was not responsive both to PPDK or the Democratic Party's manoeuvrings to nominate him and continued his duties as Minister. PPDK was disappointed in Yudhoyono's reaction and the Democratic Party continued to wait for Yudhoyono to resign his position as was expected of all presidential candidates apart from the incumbent President and Vice-President.|$|E
25|$|Before the Confederates could {{approach}} Dagwell and his men, Major Remington {{appeared with}} the rest of the detachment. When informed of the situation, Remington did not try to flee but ordered his men in line at the crest of the hill where Dagwell had viewed the 2,000-man Confederate force. Meanwhile, Stuart had heard about the encounter with his staff officers and ordered Brigadier General Wade Hampton III <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> lead regiment quickly to meet the threat. The advance unit of the Confederates, the 1st North Carolina Cavalry, then came over the hill and moved to within 30 yards of the Union line but did not move further forward despite orders which Dagwell could hear. When the Union troops did not surrender after about 15 seconds, the opposing forces began to shoot at each other.|$|E
25|$|At about 14:00, the Nawab's army ceased the cannonade {{and began}} turning back north to their entrenchments, leaving St. Frais and his {{artillery}} without support. Seeing the Nawab's forces retiring, Major Kilpatrick, {{who had been}} left {{in charge of the}} British force while Clive was resting in the hunting lodge, recognised the opportunity to cannonade the retiring enemy if St. Frais' position could be captured. Sending an officer to Clive to explain his actions, he took two companies of the 39th Regiment and two field pieces and advanced towards St. Frais' position. When Clive received the message, he hurried to the detachment and reprimanded Kilpatrick for his actions without orders and commanded <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> rest of the army from the grove. Clive himself then led the army against St. Frais' position which was taken at 15:00 when the French artillery retreated to the redoubt of the entrenchment, setting up for further action.|$|E
