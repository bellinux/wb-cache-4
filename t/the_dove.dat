5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dove</b> Street Festival of Lights – Begun 1990, <b>the</b> <b>Dove</b> Street Festival of Lights {{takes place}} each December. It began when a local {{family on the}} street adopted their {{daughter}} and wanted to dedicate an event to her. Local families on Dove street decorated the entire street with holiday lights, connecting the homes {{together to create a}} light tunnel effect. Previously, the Glee Club of the Miami University of Ohio serenaded residents with holiday songs. Town volunteers collect donations of money, food and toys at the festival that are given to The Deep Well Project, a local charity. In recent years the festival has moved from the original Dove Street to Shelter Cove Lane where the town can assist in the electrical costs.|$|E
5|$|Fincher's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Marla Singer was Janeane Garofalo, who objected to the film's sexual content.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1857, {{the need for}} a {{lighthouse}} on Point Stephens was identified, due to the proximity to the entrance of Port Stephens, and the dangers of the local coastline to ships.

At least twenty four vessels are known to have been wrecked in the area. the most serious being <b>the</b> <b>Dove</b> in 1828 with the loss of seven lives, and the Pandora in 1836 with five lives.

5|$|Woo {{draws on}} animal {{symbolism}} throughout the film. He filled {{the church with}} doves and pigeons, employing doves to represent {{the spirits of the}} people. This was the first film where Woo used <b>the</b> <b>dove</b> symbolism and he has used it to similar effect in Hard Target and Face/Off. A cat appears when Ah Jong first meets Jennie on her visit home, and secondarily when Li's partner Tsang tries to catch Ah Jong in Jennie's apartment. In Chinese culture, a cat coming into a home is an omen of ruin and poverty for its inhabitants. Both Tsang and Jennie meet negative outcomes in the film.|$|E

5|$|As {{numerous}} collectors {{had visited}} Negros prior to 1953 {{and did not}} record the species, {{it is likely that}} it was already very rare by the time of its discovery. It is suspected that the Negros fruit dove was originally a lowland species, but the destruction of forests in northern Negros forced <b>the</b> <b>dove</b> from its ideal habitat and led to its probable extinction. Today, no forest exists in northern Negros at an elevation lower than , and several searches in the 1990s of Mount Kanlaon and the surrounding area failed to discover any sign of the species' continued existence. Ornithological fieldwork has discovered that the nearby island of Panay is home to some species previously thought to be endemic to Negros, including the Negros bleeding-heart. This discovery and the presence of unexplored lowland forests on Panay give hope that the Negros fruit dove may still exist in low numbers on a nearby island. Other than the depiction of the bird on a Philippine environmental education poster in the 1990s, no conservation measures have been enacted to protect any surviving population.|$|E
5|$|At least 27vessels {{were damaged}} by the {{hurricane}} in Boston, with six watercraft having struck the South Boston Bridge, resulting in one death. Winds propelled several boats off of Gloucester out to sea, and their company was presumed to be lost. Ships elsewhere also withstood the hurricane's powerful gusts without much success– <b>the</b> <b>Dove</b> capsized at Ipswich Bar, killing seven people. The captain of the Hannah drowned at Cohasset and the vessel Mary was also beached, but the latter craft's crew survived. At Cape Cod, the Protector was swept inland near Highland Light, losing $100,000 (1804USD) in goods and leading to one death, while the John Harris capsized nearby, its crew perishing with it. Three bodies were also washed ashore at Plymouth, apparently from drowning at sea. Dozens of watercraft were driven aground at Salem, Cape Ann, and Marblehead, causing significant damage. At Abington, the storm's effects to local shipping activities were detrimental, with many vessels shipwrecked by high winds. Despite being heavily occupied, the port at New Bedford experienced no losses of ships or boats.|$|E

5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the specimen was either a runt of either the yellow-breasted fruit dove or a Treron pigeon, or a hybrid instead of a unique species; however, these views are generally considered invalid {{due in part to the}} distinctiveness of the specimen, particularly in the bare skin around the eye, and no proper evidence has suggested that the Negros fruit dove is an invalid species. It is uncertain where <b>the</b> <b>dove</b> should be placed within the genus Ptilinopus as the male's plumage, a key feature used in organizing the Ptilinopus doves, is unknown. It has been suggested that the Negros fruit dove is either most closely related to the black-naped fruit dove or represents an early colonization of the Philippines by the genus that has left no surviving close relatives. It has no known subspecies and is also known as Ripley's fruit dove.|$|E

In a more grim case, the terms war dove and war hawk have been re-purposed as labels for two opposing political factions divided over the ongoing mutual hostility between birds and the human minority: the altruistic Dove Party, who advocate for cooperation and peace between the two groups, and the militant Hawk Party, whose goal is to exterminate humanity altogether. By the time Hatoful Boyfriends narrative begins, <b>the</b> <b>Dove</b> Party, the Hawk Party, and their respective schools of thought dominate much of the world's politics.|$|E
