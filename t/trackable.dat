500|$|Initially {{there was}} {{uncertainty}} in its future track, and the hurricane posed {{a threat to}} Texas; however, Ella turned to the west as its intensification rate slowed. About 24hours before its final landfall, its center became <b>trackable</b> on radar from Brownsville, Texas. As the ridge to the north weakened, Ella slowed its forward motion markedly and quickly strengthened. In the 12hours before moving ashore, the winds increased from [...] to , making Ella a major hurricane (Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale). On September12, the hurricane made landfall near La Pesca, Tamaulipas, about 150mi (220km) south of the Mexico/United States border, with a barometric pressure of [...] This made Ella one of eleven major hurricanes to strike the Atlantic coast of Mexico in the period between 1970 and 2008. It rapidly weakened over land, dissipating early on September13 over western Nuevo Le√≥n.|$|E
5000|$|Geocaching - Locus Map {{is one of}} the {{official}} Geocaching.com API partners. It enables downloading geocaches for offline use by the Geocaching4Locus add-on, navigation to geocaches with map and compass, online and offline logging, supports waypoints, PocketQuery, <b>trackables</b> and spoilers ...|$|R
25|$|For the {{traditional}} geocache, a geocacher will place a waterproof container containing a log book (with pen or pencil) and trade items or <b>trackables,</b> then record the cache's coordinates. These coordinates, {{along with other}} details of the location, are posted on a listing site (see list of some sites below). Other geocachers obtain the coordinates from that listing site and seek out the cache using their GPS handheld receivers. The finding geocachers record their exploits in the logbook and online, but then must return the cache to the same coordinates so that other geocachers may find it. Geocachers are free to take objects (except the logbook, pencil, or stamp) from the cache in exchange for leaving something of similar or higher value.|$|R
5000|$|The {{language}} {{provides an}} extensive API that gives programmers control over nearly {{every aspect of}} the game world. It can, for example, execute simple GUI functions such as giving orders to units, changing the weather and time of day, playing sounds and displaying text to the player, and manipulating the terrain. JASS can also create powerful functions such as <b>trackables,</b> which detect if a mouse goes over or hits a position, GetLocalPlayer (...) , which can cause disconnects if used improperly (such as using handles with GetLocalPlayer (...) [...] ). It has a syntax similar to Turing and Delphi, but unlike those languages, it is case sensitive. JASS primarily uses procedural programming concepts, though popular user-made modifications to Blizzard's World Editor program have since added C++-like object-oriented programming features to the syntax of JASS.|$|R
2500|$|The Internet {{of things}} would encode 50 to 100 {{trillion}} objects, {{and be able}} to follow the movement of those objects. Human beings in surveyed urban environments are each surrounded by 1000 to 5000 <b>trackable</b> objects. In 2015 there were already 83 million smart devices in people`s homes. This number is about to grow up to 193 million devices in 2020 and will for sure go on growing in the near future.|$|E
2500|$|Anti-satellite missile tests, {{especially}} ones involving kinetic kill vehicles {{as in this}} case, {{contribute to}} the formation of orbital space debris which can remain in orbit for many years and could interfere with future space activity (Kessler Syndrome). [...] This event was the largest recorded creation of space debris in history with more than 2,000 pieces of <b>trackable</b> size (golf ball size and larger) officially cataloged in the immediate aftermath, and an estimated 150,000 debris particles. , a total of 3,438 pieces of debris had been detected, with 571 decayed and 2,867 still in orbit nine years after the incident.|$|E
2500|$|To some extent, results {{along these}} lines have been {{achieved}} in trials performed around the globe, making use of GPS, mobile phone signals, and vehicle registration plates. [...] GPS is becoming standard in many new high-end vehicles and is an option on most new low- and mid-range vehicles. In addition, many users also have mobile phones which transmit <b>trackable</b> signals (and may also be GPS-enabled). [...] Mobile phones can already be traced for purposes of emergency response. [...] GPS and mobile phone tracking, however, do not provide fully reliable data. Furthermore, integrating mobile phones in vehicles may be prohibitively difficult. Data from mobile phones, though useful, might even increase risks to motorists as they tend {{to look at their}} phones rather than concentrate on their driving. Automatic registration plate recognition can provide high levels of data, but continuously tracking a vehicle through a corridor is a difficult task with existing technology. Today's equipment is designed for data acquisition and functions such as enforcement and tolling, not for returning data to vehicles or motorists for response. GPS will nevertheless be one of the key components in VII systems.|$|E
2500|$|Typical cache [...] "treasures", {{also known}} in the geocaching world as swag, are not high in {{monetary}} value but may hold personal value to the finder. Aside from the logbook, common cache contents are unusual coins or currency, small toys, ornamental buttons, CDs, or books. Although not required, many geocachers decide to leave behind signature items, such as personal Geocoins, pins, or craft items, to mark their presence at the cache location. Disposable cameras are popular as they allow for anyone who found the cache {{to take a picture}} which can be developed and uploaded to a Geocaching web site listed below. Also common are objects that are moved from cache to cache called [...] "hitchhikers", such as Travel Bugs or Geocoins, whose travels may be logged and followed online. Cachers who initially place a Travel Bug or Geocoins often assign specific goals for their <b>trackable</b> items. Examples of goals are to be placed in a certain cache a long distance from home, or to travel to a certain country, or to travel faster and farther than other hitchhikers in a race. Less common trends are site-specific information pages about the historic significance of the site, types of trees, birds in the area or other such information. Higher-value items are occasionally included in geocaches as a reward for the First to Find (called [...] "FTF"), or in locations which are harder to reach. Dangerous or illegal items, weapons, food and drugs are not allowed and are specifically against the rules of most geocache listing sites.|$|E

50|$|Trackables are {{patterns}} that are searched, recognized and tracked {{in the video}} screen coming from the camera of the device. A wide variety of different tracking technologies exist, including QR codes, Natural features, 3D and Face Tracking. As all these tracking types use different algorithms and technologies, {{the definition of a}} <b>Trackable</b> is abstracted and split into two parts, a Tracker and its associated Trackables. A Tracker describes the technology (or algorithm) with which its associated Trackables should be tracked, using URIs identifying the algorithm. The <b>Trackable</b> itself describes the pattern the algorithm should look for in the video stream.|$|E
