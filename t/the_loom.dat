40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} path of <b>the</b> <b>looms</b> {{is a key}} to study on <b>the</b> <b>looms</b> in ancient China. Based on the studies on historical materials and archeological findings of <b>the</b> <b>looms</b> in ancient China, we found that there were two paths in the development process of <b>the</b> <b>looms</b> in ancient China. Before the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220), plain weave and figure-weave fabrics were produced on similar <b>looms.</b> But after <b>the</b> Han Dynasty, the two kinds of looms evolved into all kinds of <b>the</b> treadle <b>loom,</b> <b>the</b> multi-heald and multi-treadle <b>loom</b> and <b>the</b> draw <b>loom...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>looms</b> were in less demand {{after the}} 1950s as the British cotton {{industry}} declined. One use {{was made possible}} by utilising <b>the</b> <b>looms</b> to weave fibreglass. The resulting cloth was used to create nosecones for fighter aircraft and to create moulds for forming the nosecone of Concorde.|$|R
5|$|Wesley trains under Fox's leadership, {{learning}} endurance, knife {{fighting and}} {{hand to hand}} combat.He also learns to control and use his abilities for firearm marksmanship, including curving bullets around targets. Frustrated by his lack of progress and the brutality of the training, Wesley insists he is ready, but Sloan disagrees. Wesley refocuses on his training and starts to excel. Sloan then shows him <b>the</b> <b>Loom</b> of Fate, which has served for 1,000 years in giving coded names of Fraternity targets through errors in the fabric. <b>The</b> <b>Loom</b> identifies those who will create evil and chaos in the future, with Sloan responsible for interpreting the code.|$|E
5|$|After several {{successful}} missions, including dumping {{his girlfriend}} {{with the help}} of Fox, Wesley has an unexpected shootout with Cross, wherein he accidentally kills the Exterminator, a Fraternity member he had befriended. Cross shoots Wesley in the shoulder. Sloan grants Wesley's wish to avenge his father and sends him after Cross—but then secretly gives Fox a mission to kill Wesley, saying that his name has come up in <b>the</b> <b>Loom.</b>|$|E
5|$|While Mooseheart {{began as}} a school, it soon grew to become a small {{incorporated}} village and hub of the organization, housing the headquarters of <b>the</b> <b>LOOM,</b> {{as well as the}} Women of the Moose. The population of Mooseheart would grow to 1,000 by 1920, reach a peak of 1,300 during the Great Depression and go down to approximately 500, the campus' current maximum capacity, in 1979.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, Providence {{was one of}} the wealthiest cities in the United States. Immigrant labor powered one of the nation's largest {{industrial}} manufacturing centers. Providence was a major manufacturer of industrial products from steam engines to precision tools to silverware, screws, and textiles. Giant companies were based in or near Providence, such as Brown & Sharpe, the Corliss Steam Engine Company, Babcock & Wilcox, the Grinnell Corporation, the Gorham Manufacturing Company, Nicholson File, and the Fruit of <b>the</b> <b>Loom</b> textile company.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{at the end}} of the 14th century, {{no doubt}} on account of the devastation caused mid-century by the Black Death, there was a general shift towards less {{expensive}} techniques. Many things which would have earlier been completely forbidden by the guilds were now commonplace (using low quality wool, carding, etc.). In the silk industry, the use of water-powered mills grew, and by the 15th century, <b>the</b> <b>loom</b> designed by Jean le Calabrais saw nearly universal use.|$|E
5|$|The Jacquard loom was {{immediately}} denounced by workers, who accused it of causing unemployment, but soon {{it had become}} vital to the industry. <b>The</b> <b>loom</b> was declared public property in 1806, and Jacquard was rewarded with a pension and a royalty on each machine. In 1834 there were a total of 2885 Jacquard looms in Lyon alone. The Canut revolt in 1831 foreshadowed many of the larger worker uprisings of the Industrial Revolution. The canuts occupied the city of Lyon, and would not relinquish it until a bloody repression by the army, led by Marshal Soult. A second revolt, similar to the first, took place in 1834.|$|E

5|$|Like {{his father}} before him, Alec Waugh {{went to school}} at Sherborne, and, it was presumed by the family that Evelyn would follow, but in 1915, the school asked Alec to leave, after a {{homosexual}} relationship came to light. Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an officer, and, while awaiting confirmation of his commission, wrote <b>The</b> <b>Loom</b> of Youth (1917), a novel of school life, which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne. The public sensation caused by Alec's novel so offended the school that it became impossible for Evelyn to go there. In May 1917, much to his annoyance, {{he was sent to}} Lancing College, in his opinion, a decidedly inferior school.|$|E
5|$|The encyclopedist Song Yingxing (1587–1666) {{documented}} a {{wide array}} of technologies, metallurgic and industrial processes in his Tiangong Kaiwu encyclopedia of 1637. This includes mechanical and hydraulic powered devices for agriculture and irrigation, nautical technology such as vessel types and snorkeling gear for pearl divers, the annual processes of sericulture and weaving with <b>the</b> <b>loom,</b> metallurgic processes such as the crucible technique and quenching, manufacturing processes such as for roasting iron pyrite in converting sulphide to oxide in sulfur used in gunpowder compositions – illustrating how ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthen furnace with a still-head that sent over sulfur as vapor that would solidify and crystallize – and the use of gunpowder weapons such as a naval mine ignited by use of a rip-cord and steel flint wheel.|$|E
5|$|Wesley {{attacks the}} base using {{explosive}} rats (a tactic {{he learned from}} the Exterminator), killing surviving Fraternity assassins,including The Repairman and the Butcher (who he kills in a knife fight) in a massive shootout. Entering Sloan's office, he is surrounded by Fox, Gunsmith and the remaining assassins. Wesley discloses Sloan's deception, to which Sloan reveals that {{the names of those}} present had legitimately come up in <b>the</b> <b>Loom,</b> and that he had acted to protect them. He gives the members a choice: kill themselves, per the code, or kill Wesley and use their skills to control the world. As the others choose the latter, Fox curves a bullet around the room, choosing to follow the code and kill everyone, including herself, but not before throwing her gun to Wesley. Sloan escapes in the mayhem.|$|E

5|$|Production {{moved to}} the Czech Republic later in May, {{scheduled}} for 12 weeks of shooting, which included a scene in Pernštejn Castle. Using a former sugar factory in Prague, production designer John Myhre constructed a large textile factory {{as part of an}} industrial world, the setting of a mythological environment in which looms create fabrics that weavers interpret as assassination orders. Afterward, filming moved to Budapest, then returned to Chicago in August. While the actors performed many of their own stunts, with free running and parkour in some of the action scenes, and Angelina Jolie being actually strapped to the hood of a moving Dodge Viper, some of the especially high-risk sequences required digital doubles instead. Two full-sized train cars were built, a Chicago 'L' for a training scene where Fox and Wesley run atop a train, and a Czech Pendolino for the derailment, which was stationed in a gimbal equipped with hydraulics to allow the car to tilt and roll as the train crashed. The film originally had both an alternate opening and an alternate ending. The alternate opening, a flashback to ancient times describing the history of the Fraternity and <b>the</b> <b>Loom</b> of Fate, is available on the special edition DVD and Blu-ray.|$|E
25|$|The plain Hattersley Domestic Loom was {{specially}} {{developed for}} cottage or home use {{and designed to}} replace the wooden handloom; the Domestic is similar in construction to a power loom. It was introduced ca.1900 and the makers claimed that a speed of 160 picks per minute could be easily attained with from 2 to 8 shafts weaving a variety of fabrics. Because foot pedals, or treadles, operate <b>the</b> <b>loom</b> it is still classed as a handloom, but {{it is much easier}} and faster to weave as all the motions of <b>the</b> <b>loom</b> are connected via crankshaft and gear wheels. Because <b>the</b> <b>loom</b> is designed to use only one shuttle when weaving, giving a solid colour in the weft, it is termed a plain loom. The cast metal chair, manufactured along with <b>the</b> <b>loom,</b> can be raised or lowered to suit, and the seat rocks forward and back as the weaver treadles <b>the</b> <b>loom.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Tabriz loom, {{named after}} the city of Tabriz, is used in Northwestern Iran.

25|$|The weaving process uses a loom. The lengthway threads {{are known}} as the warp, and the cross way threads {{are known as}} the weft. The warp which must be strong needs to be {{presented}} to loom on a warp beam. The weft passes across <b>the</b> <b>loom</b> in a shuttle, that carries the yarn on a pirn. These pirns are automatically changed by <b>the</b> <b>loom.</b> Thus, the yarn needs to be wrapped onto a beam, and onto pirns before weaving can commence.|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} a weaving shed was to provide spaces for {{rows and rows of}} {{identical}} looms. A standard shed would house 1200 looms, and it was common to think in multiples of 400 looms. These looms would be tentered by weavers who worked from four to eight looms each and were paid on piece-rate. <b>The</b> <b>looms</b> would be maintained by a skilled tackler who would be on hand to gait <b>the</b> <b>looms</b> and effect instant repairs or adjustments. There would be four tacklers for 400 <b>looms.</b> <b>The</b> <b>looms</b> were powered by leather belts from overhead cross-shafts, on bevel gears from the line shaft that ran the length of the shed.|$|R
