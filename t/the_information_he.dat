5|$|On March 7, 1914, he {{returned}} to Veracruz with <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>he</b> had gathered and presented it to his commanders.

5|$|Ernest {{believed}} he could communicate with both extraterrestrials and historical figures, channeling messages from them. In 1954, seeking to popularize his channeling, Ernest and Ruth formed an organization known as Unarius, operating {{from their home in}} California. After their marriage, Ruth served as Ernest's typist, later claiming to have learned the skill while sleeping. She recorded <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>he</b> channeled, writing books about psychic healing and trips into the solar system. In the 1950s and 1960s, they attracted several followers, including two students whom they later taught to channel. One early trainee was Charles Spiegel, who later led the group. Many converts had previous involvement with New Age or mystic groups, making it easy for the Normans to convert them.|$|E
5|$|A {{local radio}} show {{schedules}} {{an interview with}} Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to discuss Dunder Mifflin, but, unbeknown to Dwight, the interview is later canceled. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) suggests they all use this to their advantage, and stage an interview for Dwight's benefit. Dwight believes he is talking to the interviewer through {{the phone in the}} break room, but is actually talking to Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) who is using an American accent. They convince him that <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>he</b> is giving leads to a hostage situation with CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) cornered in his house. Dwight calls David and tries to talk him into surrendering to the police. David is confused but nonetheless responds in a way that leads Dwight to believe he was successful. He emerges from the break room and is greeted by a round of applause from his coworkers.|$|E

5|$|Gabriel {{taps into}} their {{connection}} and reveals {{that he has}} located McClane's estranged daughter, Lucy, and intends to kidnap her. McClane and Farrell race to the Woodlawn facility, where Farrell discovers that Gabriel's men are downloading all <b>the</b> <b>information.</b> <b>He</b> manages to encrypt the data just in time before he is captured. Gabriel kidnaps Farrell and takes him as well as Lucy, who had been kidnapped earlier, with him as his team flees from Woodlawn. McClane pursues Gabriel, hijacking his semi and enlisting Warlock to trace Gabriel's vehicle. Gabriel accesses the communication system of a U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Lightning II and, impersonating an air traffic controller, orders the pilot to attack the truck McClane is driving. McClane barely escapes, then {{makes his way to}} a nearby warehouse where Warlock has tracked Gabriel. There, Gabriel is installing the remaining files and holding Lucy and Farrell. Although McClane kills most of Gabriel's remaining henchmen, Emerson shoots him in the right shoulder.|$|E
5|$|In 2010's {{video game}} , the Queen (voiced by Kyoko Satomi in Japanese and Susanne Blakeslee in English) {{appears in the}} Dwarf Woodlands world. She {{recruits}} the protagonist Terra to kill Snow White and bring back her heart in return for allowing him to use the Magic Mirror to locate Master Xehanort. Terra, like the huntsman, ultimately does not go through with this, and the Queen, learning of his betrayal, forces the Mirror to consume him, but Terra manages to fight the Mirror off and the Queen reluctantly gives him <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>he</b> looks for. She later appears briefly in Ventus's scenario, where she crosses paths with him {{on her way to}} poison Snow White. She drops the poisoned apple, which Ventus returns to her. She notices Ventus's Keyblade and muses that Terra threatened her with a similar weapon. She is then only briefly mentioned in Aqua's storyline, when the Magic Mirror tells Aqua that the Queen is dead and he is no longer under her control.|$|E
5|$|The atlas {{includes}} further 28 maps: 16 of Britain, 4 of Denmark and {{one each}} of the polar regions, Iceland, Norway with Sweden, Prussia, Livonia, Russia, Lithuania, Transylvania and Crimea. This collection of maps is dedicated to Queen Elizabeth of England and in the preface Mercator acknowledges <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>he</b> received from English mariners through Rumold who {{had spent much of}} his working life in London. The full atlas included all the maps of the previous two collections, making in all 102 new maps by Mercator. His heirs added 5 introductory maps before publication: world map and Europe by Rumold, Africa and Asia by grandson Gerard and America by grandson Michael. Nevertheless the atlas was incomplete: Spain was omitted and there were no detailed maps outside Europe. The maps are in a variety of projections.|$|E

5|$|The first biographical {{sketch of}} Friedrich Accum's life {{was written by}} the American {{agricultural}} chemist and historian of science Charles Albert Browne, Jr. in 1925. He studied the life and works of Accum closely for ten years, which {{he was able to}} complement with information from civil and ecclesiastical sources in Bückeburg. His enthusiasm for the subject was so great that he traveled to Germany in July 1930 to meet with Hugo Otto Georg Hans Westphal (August 26, 1873 – September 15, 1934), a great-grandson of Accum's. Brown's last writing on the subject, which appeared in 1948 in Chymia, a journal for the history of chemistry, relied to a great extent on <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>he</b> gathered from Hugo Westphal. Three years later, R. J. Cole published an outline of Accum's life based on English sources. He was particularly concerned with bringing new information to light about the judicial process of 1821. Like Browne, Cole also provided relatively little data about the last part of Accum's life in Berlin. A modern presentation of Accum's life and works that fills in the lacuna in the available biographies has not been written. Lawson Cockroft of the Royal Society of Chemistry in London observed that Friedrich Accum was one of those chemists who, despite significant achievements in his lifetime, was by and large forgotten today.|$|E

25|$|The {{body of the}} Wests' former {{friend and}} housemate, Terrence Crick, was found in his car in the Scarborough {{district}} of Hackness in January 1996. He was 48 years old. Crick had become acquainted with Fred while he had resided at the Lake House Caravan Park in 1969; he had reported Fred to the authorities on several occasions after having been shown both surgical instruments Fred claimed to have used to perform illegal abortions, and Polaroid images of the subjects' genitals {{he claimed to have}} taken immediately after the procedures, before suggesting Crick assist him in recruiting pregnant girls to perform upon. Crick had believed <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>he</b> had provided to police was ignored as Fred was a known police informant. The stress and guilt Crick had felt over the fact <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>he</b> had provided had not resulted in charges being brought apparently led him to take his own life; an inquest later recorded a verdict of suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. His widow later submitted a formal complaint to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.|$|E

25|$|German espionage {{activity}} in Cuba was minor, despite the country's {{importance to the}} Allied war-effort, and was eliminated by Allied counter-intelligence before it could really begin. Shortly after {{the beginning of the}} war, the Germans began operating a clandestine communications network in South America to collect secret information and safely smuggle it out of the region to Occupied Europe. For Cuba, the Abwehr sent a man named Heinz Lüning to Havana with orders to establish a secret radio station and then transmit <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>he</b> collected to agents in South America, where it would then be sent directly to Germany.|$|E
