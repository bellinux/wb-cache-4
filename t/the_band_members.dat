According to the band's tell-all autobiography, Collins pledged in September 1986 he could make Aerosmith the biggest band in the world by 1990 if they all completed drug rehab. Their next album was crucial because of the commercial disappointment of Done With Mirrors, and as <b>the</b> <b>band</b> <b>members</b> became clean, they worked hard to make their next album a success.|$|E

5|$|On the tour's {{opening night}} at the Odeon in Cheltenham, the volume of sound created by the {{screaming}} crowds {{was so great that}} The Beatles' amplification equipment proved unequal to it, so much so that <b>the</b> <b>band</b> <b>members</b> were unable to hear any sounds they were making themselves, whether speaking, singing, or playing their instruments.
