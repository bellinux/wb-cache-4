5|$|By 1704, {{the area}} that is today Elmsford was known as Storm's Bridge, after Abraham Storm, who {{established}} a tavern at the junction of the Saw Mill River and Tarrytown roads (today routes 9A and 119) that is <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> village today. In 1719, one of the Philipse tenant farmers, William Hammond, built his house on land he leased in what is today Eastview, where his house still stands. Along the river to the north, his brother Staats Hammond built two mills along the river; the small settlement of Hammond's Mill became today's Hawthorne.|$|E
5|$|In general, any three {{distinct}} circles {{have a unique}} circle—the radical circle—that intersects all of them perpendicularly; <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> circle is the radical center of the three circles. For illustration, the orange circle in Figure6 crosses the black given circles at right angles. Inversion in the radical circle leaves the given circles unchanged, but transforms the two conjugate pink solution circles into one another. Under the same inversion, the corresponding points of tangency of the two solution circles are transformed into one another; for illustration, in Figure6, the two blue points lying on each green line are transformed into one another. Hence, the lines connecting these conjugate tangent points are invariant under the inversion; therefore, they must pass {{through the center of}} inversion, which is the radical center (green lines intersecting at the orange dot in Figure 6).|$|E

25|$|The Cedula of Population of 1783 {{laid the}} {{foundation}} and growth {{of the population of}} Trinidad. The island's Spanish possessors contributed little towards advancements, with El Dorado the focus; Trinidad's geographical location made it <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> focus. Following the Cedula, French planters (accompanied by their slaves, free coloreds and mulattos) from the French Antilles of Martinique, Grenada, Guadeloupe and Dominica migrated to the Trinidad. This exodus was encouraged due to the French Revolution. The Spanish also gave many incentives to lure settlers to the island, including exemption from taxes for 10 years and land grants in accordance to the terms set out in the Cedula. These new immigrants established local communities of Blanchisseuse, Champs Fleurs, Paramin, Cascade, Carenage and Laventille. Trinidad's population jumped from less than 1,400 in 1777, to over 15,000 by the end of 1789. In 1797, Trinidad became a British crown colony, with a French-speaking population.|$|E
25|$|In 1814 the {{township}} of Elkland, was organized. Its territory, taken from Delmar Township, extended along the New York state {{line from the}} ninety-third to the one hundred and fourth mile-stone—a distance of eleven miles (18km). It extended north and south a distance of ten miles (16km) and embraced within its boundaries the present borough of Elkland and townships of Nelson, Osceola, all of Farmington, and parts of Lawrence, Deerfield, and Middlebury townships. In December 1816, a part of {{the township}} of Lawrence was taken from it, and in September 1822, another portion of its territory went to Middlebury township. In February 1830, the territory of the township of Farmington was taken from it. Those several reductions confined it to a narrow strip, about eight miles (13km) long, from east to west, by two and three-fourths miles wide, from north to south. By an act of the legislature, approved April 10, 1849, its territory was still further reduced by the creation of the borough of Elkland, to which, from time to time, additions have been made. In January 1857, all that part of the township not embraced in Elkland borough limits, lying west of a line extending through <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> borough, from north to south, was erected into the township of Osceola, and in December 1857, all lying east of the same line became the township of Nelson, and Elkland township passed out of existence. By the subsequent extension of the Elkland borough limits south of the Cowanesque river, the townships of Osceola and Nelson both suffered material reductions of area. There is still left, however, a narrow strip between the southern boundary of Elkland and the northern boundary Farmington township, the western half of which belongs to Osceola Township, and the eastern half to the township of Nelson. Some years ago a movement was afoot to annex this strip to Elkland borough and thus give it and Osceola and Nelson townships more symmetrical boundaries, but for some reason the annexation was not made.|$|E

The settlers were not, however, ultimately successful, and many, including Polk himself, purchased land from McCulloh or were otherwise bribed into cooperation. Polk was also given a position as a commissioner for the new town of Charlotte due to McCulloh's influence, and served as McCulloh's land agent in the newly created Mecklenburg County. Charlotte had been founded at the crossroad of a small trail with the Indian Trading Path near where that great thoroughfare entered the lands occupied by the Catawba people.

Filibe became <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> struggle with leaders such as Nayden Gerov, Dr Valkovich, Joakim Gruev and whole families. In 1836 the first Bulgarian school was inaugurated and in 1850 modern secular education began when the [...] "St Cyrill and Metodius" [...] school was opened. On 11 May 1858 the day of Saints Cyril and Methodius was celebrated for the first time, this later became a National holiday which is still celebrated today (but on the 24th May due to Bulgaria's 1916 transition from the Old Style (i.e. Julian) to the New Style calendar, i.e. the Gregorian calendar). In 1858 in the Church of Virgin Mary the Christmas liturgy was served for the first time in the Bulgarian language since the beginning of the Ottoman occupation. Until 1906 there were Bulgarian and Greek bishops in the city. In 1868 the school expanded into the first grammar school. Some of the intellectuals, politicians and spiritual leaders of the nation graduated that school.|$|E

60|$|Exper. 15. The Sun shining {{into a dark}} Chamber {{through a}} little round Hole in the Window-shut, let S [in Fig. 26.] {{represent}} his round white Image painted on the opposite Wall by his direct Light, PT his oblong coloured Image made by refracting that Light with a Prism placed at the Window; and pt, or 2p 2t, 3p 3t, his oblong colour'd Image made by refracting again the same Light sideways with a second Prism placed immediately after {{the first in a}} cross Position to it, as was explained in the fifth Experiment; that is to say, pt when the Refraction of the second Prism is small, 2p 2t when its Refraction is greater, and 3p 3t when it is greatest. For such will be the diversity of the Refractions, if the refracting Angle of the second Prism be of various Magnitudes; suppose of fifteen or twenty Degrees to make the Image pt, of thirty or forty to make the Image 2p 2t, and of sixty to make the Image 3p 3t. But for want of solid Glass Prisms with Angles of convenient Bignesses, there may be Vessels made of polished Plates of Glass cemented together in the form of Prisms and filled with Water. These things being thus ordered, I observed that all the solar Images or coloured Spectrums PT, pt, 2p 2t, 3p 3t did very nearly converge to the place S on which the direct Light of the Sun fell and painted his white round Image when the Prisms were taken away. The Axis of the Spectrum PT, that is the Line drawn through the middle of it parallel to its rectilinear Sides, did when produced pass exactly through the middle of that white round Image S. And when the Refraction of the second Prism was equal to the Refraction of the first, the refracting Angles of them both being about 60 Degrees, the Axis of the Spectrum 3p 3t made by that Refraction, did when produced pass also through the middle of the same white round Image S. But when the Refraction of the second Prism was less than that of the first, the produced Axes of the Spectrums tp or 2t 2p made by that Refraction did cut the produced Axis of the Spectrum TP in the points m and n, a little beyond <b>the</b> <b>Center</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> white round Image S. Whence the proportion of the Line 3tT to the Line 3pP was a little greater than the Proportion of 2tT or 2pP, and this Proportion a little greater than that of tT to pP. Now when the Light of the Spectrum PT falls perpendicularly upon the Wall, those Lines 3tT, 3pP, and 2tT, and 2pP, and tT, pP, are the Tangents of the Refractions, and therefore by this Experiment the Proportions of the Tangents of the Refractions are obtained, from whence the Proportions of the Sines being derived, they come out equal, so far as by viewing the Spectrums, and using some mathematical Reasoning I could estimate. For I did not make an accurate Computation. So then the Proposition holds true in every Ray apart, so far as appears by Experiment. And that it is accurately true, may be demonstrated upon this Supposition. That Bodies refract Light by acting upon its Rays in Lines perpendicular to their Surfaces. But in order to this Demonstration, I must distinguish the Motion of every Ray into two Motions, the one perpendicular to the refracting Surface, the other parallel to it, and concerning the perpendicular Motion lay down the following Proposition.|$|E
