40|$|The {{imposition}} of the insanity defense is a complicated psycho-legal scenario. Globally, definitions of insanity differ from country to country. In a multitude of cases, a determination of insanity {{at the time of}} a criminal act means the offender will not be considered responsible for his or her action(s). In many jurisdictions, concerns have been raised that the insanity defense has been used <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> <b>punishment,</b> usually after a particularly heinous crime. In this review, the authors use three cases - FRENDAK, PHENIS, and BREIVIK to demonstrate how the {{imposition of}} the insanity defense has been used for legal purposes in the past and present. In an effort to give more background to each of the above-mentioned cases, the writers have provided some details to aid comprehension. The authors offer recommendations for the ethical forensic evaluator unburdened by partisan allegiance and invested in the search for truth. This review article relies on peer-reviewed articles available from PubMed, Meharry Online Library and legal dictionaries. We also cross-referenced reputable news sources to ensure the validity of the facts we present...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{presents}} the results of my unique study of 800 criminal cases addressing neuroscience evidence {{over the past two decades}} (1992 – 2012). Many legal scholars have theorized about the impact of neuroscience evidence on the criminal law, but this is the first empirical study of its kind to systematically investigate how courts assess the mitigating and aggravating strength of such evidence. My analysis reveals that neuroscience evidence is usually offered <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> <b>punishments</b> in the way that traditional criminal law has always allowed, especially in the penalty phase of death penalty trials. This finding controverts the popular image of neuroscience evidence as a double-edged sword—one that will either get defendants off the hook altogether or unfairly brand them as posing a future danger to society. To the contrary, my study indicates that neuroscience evidence is typically introduced for a well-established legal purpose—to provide fact-finders with more complete, reliable, and precise information when determining a defendant’s fate. My study also shows that courts accept neuroscience evidence for this purpose, and in fact expect attorneys to raise this evidence when possible on behalf of their clients. This expectation is so entrenched that courts are willing to grant defendants their “ineffective assistance of counsel” claims when attorneys fail <b>to</b> pursue this <b>mitigating</b> evidence. Meanwhile, my study also reveals that the potential future danger posed by defendants is rarely a facet of cases involving neuroscience evidence—again contradicting the myth of the double-edged sword. The cases that do address future danger, however, offer fascinating insight into the complex legal issues raised by neuroscience evidence. As courts continue to embrace neuroscience tools and techniques, the empirical data collected in my study provide a foundation for discussions regarding the use of neuroscience evidence in criminal cases. The findings presented in this Article will ensure that those discussions are grounded in fact rather than hyperbole...|$|R

40|$|In Hiding from Humanity: Disgust, Shame, and thc Law, Martha C. Nussbaum {{critically}} {{examines the}} role of emotions in our legal system. Nussbaum combines insights from child psychology. history, sociology. and legal theory to determine whether shame and disgust are reliable foundations {{on which to base}} law. She concludes that these two emotions serve as repositories of unreasonableness, mediums for abuse of minorities, and reflections of a society 2 ̆ 7 s current anxieties. Thus, they form a portrait of current prejudices and Yllinerabilities, and should not constitute the basis for mitigation. This Book Review applies Nussbaum 2 ̆ 7 s analysis to the case of Gwen Araujo, a transgendered woman killed by four of her friends. In that case, defendants attempted <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> the <b>punishment</b> for their brutal killing through a heat of passion argument called a 2 ̆ 2 trans panic defense. 2 ̆ 2 An examination of the provocation, emotion, and reasonableness elements of a heat of passion claim reveals that trans panic defenses never justifY this type of mitigation.

500|$|The Wehrmacht {{initially}} {{responded by}} rounding up and executing 300 Serbian civilians, described in contemporary documents as [...] "communists, nationalists, democrats and Jews." [...] Over the following several days, all men {{between the ages}} of 14 and 60 were arrested and herded into a makeshift detention centre at the local rolling-stock factory. Once there, their papers were checked and their names entered into a ledger. When the camp was full, the Wehrmacht ordered groups of 100 prisoners to march to pre-dug mass graves, where they were executed with heavy machine guns. The bodies were then examined for any signs of life; victims that had survived the initial volley were dealt a single bullet to the head. Once the first group had been liquidated, the soldiers returned to the factory and collected the next 100 victims. This process continued until all the men that were rounded up had been killed. The reprisals lasted several days.

50|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while interned as a prisoner of war of the enemy Japanese in the city of Makassar, Celebes, Netherlands East Indies, in April 1942. Acting instantly on behalf of a naval officer who was subjected to a vicious clubbing by a frenzied Japanese guard venting his insane wrath upon the helpless prisoner, Comdr. (then Lt.) Antrim boldly intervened, attempting to quiet the guard and finally persuading him to discuss the charges against the officer. With the entire Japanese force assembled and making extraordinary preparations for the threatened beating, and with the tension heightened by 2,700 Allied prisoners rapidly closing in, Comdr. Antrim courageously appealed to the fanatic enemy, risking his own life in a desperate effort <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> the <b>punishment.</b> When the other had been beaten unconscious by 15 blows of a hawser and was repeatedly kicked by 3 soldiers to a point beyond which he could not survive, Comdr. Antrim gallantly stepped forward and indicated to the perplexed guards that he would take the remainder of the punishment, throwing the Japanese completely off balance in their amazement and eliciting a roar of acclaim from the suddenly inspired Allied prisoners. By his fearless leadership and valiant concern for the welfare of another, he not only saved the life of a fellow officer and stunned the Japanese into sparing his own life but also brought about a new respect for American officers and men and a great improvement in camp living conditions. His heroic conduct throughout reflects the highest credit upon Comdr. Antrim and the U.S. Naval Service.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the relationship, {{in theory and}} in practice, between the concepts of justice (iustitia) and mercy (misericordia) in English courts between c. 1100 and c. 1250. During this period English judges (in courts of both common and canon law) were faced with a serious dilemma. The emergence of systematic law had fundamentally altered the pastoral foundations of the act of judgement. On the one hand, judges were incorporated into a system of law in which justice {{was expected to be}} routine and regular. They were bound by procedure, and ‘justice’ was considered to lie in the return of due punishment for injury. On the other, this notion of strict justice coexisted with an alternative way of conceiving of judicial responsibilities, which emphasised that justice was incomplete unless it incorporated within it the principle of mercy. This tradition argued that, both {{for the benefit of the}} offender and the judge’s own soul, it was safer and more virtuous <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> the <b>punishments</b> prescribed by law. English judges were caught in a dilemma, and were, in effect, obliged to choose between two fundamentally opposed ideas of justice, and two starkly contrasting approaches to sentencing. This thesis argues that such a choice was a problem which concerned the schools of theology as much as it did the courts of law. It {{examines the}} attempts of theologians and lawyers to resolve the dilemma and provide practical counsel to judges. Scripture, classical philosophy and patristic texts were the key sources in a discussion of how judicial discretion should be exercised in choosing between punitive and merciful courses of action. Rather than conceiving of justice as a purely procedural exercise, English law, and English judges, appreciated that the act of giving judgement was a complex pastoral challenge.

30|$|The {{inability}} of wind turbines <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> or ride through grid disturbances poses new challenges to operation stability in electric power systems [7]. Small signal or large signal disturbances also cause stability problems in conventional electric power systems. Based on dynamic {{characteristics of the}} load, the process to secure operation stability involves disturbance identification, dynamic control of generations, special protection schemes for system security, etc. Dynamic control of generations responds to disturbances in three ways: active power responses <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> phase disturbance, active power responses <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> frequency disturbance, and reactive power responses <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> voltage disturbance. With large-scale wind generation in the system, the net dynamics of generations exhibits two new features: decreasing ability <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> disturbances and decreasing ability to survive disturbances. The study shows that these features first impact voltage stability at the interconnection and further impact angle and frequency stability of the system when the penetration level grows. Large-scale integration of wind therefore requires a substantial increase of the ability of wind plants <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> and survive grid disturbances.|$|R
