The most prominent of these chieftains was most likely Eshaq Khan, who preserved Torbat-e Heydarieh as his center of operations. In the eastern parts of the Alborz, Kurdish chieftains ruled over several fortresses, such as Bojnord, Quchan, Dargaz, and Kalat.|$|E

50|$|Traditionalism is not {{infrequently}} {{referred to}} as Conservative or even Ultra-conservative theory. Recent multi-dimensional typological attempt presents an ambiguous picture. Some detailed scholarly studies claim that Traditionalism and Conservatism are clearly distinct concepts, be it in case of Spain or in general. The former understands politics as means of achieving missionary Catholic objectives, <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> as a technique of exercising public power. The former is founded on unalterable nucleus, <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> is in principle evolutionary. The former is providential, <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> is deterministic and historicist. The former is incompatible with democracy, <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> is perfectly tailored to operate in a realm founded on sovereignty of the peoples assumption. The former is monarchist, <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> is accidentalist. <b>The</b> former is derived from vernacular cultural tradition, <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> is in principle universal. The former perceives society as based on presumed natural order, <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> as stemming from contractual and voluntaristic principles embodied in a constitution. The former understands society as composed of organic bodies, <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> as composed of free individuals. The former sees public power as united and integral, <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> as divided into legislative, executive and judicial branches. Perhaps a good though obviously simplistic way of summarizing {{the difference between the}} two is noting that while the Conservatives usually have no problem admitting their Right-wing identity, the Traditionalists are uneasy about it, pointing that their concept is rooted in pre-1789 realm, before the Right-Left paradigm had been even born.|$|R
25|$|Agha Mohammad Khan {{subsequently}} demanded Heraclius II {{to renounce}} the treaty with Russia {{of several years}} earlier, and to reaccept Persian suzerainty, in return for peace and the security of his kingdom. The Ottomans, Iran's neighboring rival, recognized <b>the</b> <b>latters</b> rights over Kartli and Kakheti {{for the first time}} in four centuries. Heraclius appealed then to his theoretical protector, Empress Catherine II of Russia, pledging for at least 3,000 Russian troops, but he was ignored, leaving Georgia to fend off the Persian threat alone. Nevertheless, Heraclius II still rejected the Khan's ultimatum. As a response, Agha Mohammad Khan invaded the Caucasus region after crossing the Aras river, and, while on his way to Georgia, he re-subjugated Iran's territories of the Erivan Khanate, Shirvan, Nakhchivan Khanate, Ganja khanate, Derbent Khanate, Baku khanate, Talysh Khanate, Shaki Khanate, Karabakh Khanate, which comprise modern-day Armenia, Azerbaijan, Dagestan, and Igdir. Having reached Georgia with his large army, it culminated in the Battle of Krtsanisi, which resulted in the capture, and sack of Tbilisi, as well as the effective resubjugation of Georgia into Iran. Upon his return from his successful campaign in Tbilisi and in effective control over Georgia, together with some 15,000 Georgian captives that were moved back to mainland Iran, Agha Mohammad was formally crowned Shah in 1796 in the Mughan plain, just like his predecessor Nader Shah was about sixty years earlier.|$|E
