As digital technology proliferated, and the switch from analog to digital record keeping became the new standard in business, a relatively new job description was popularized, <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> clerk.

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} resolving genotypes into haplotypes, under the perfect {{phylogeny}} model, {{has been under}} intensive study recently. All studies so far handled missing <b>data</b> <b>entries</b> in a heuristic manner. We prove that the perfect phylogeny haplotype problem is NP-complete when some of <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>entries</b> are missing, even when the phylogeny is rooted. We define a biologically motivated probabilistic model for genotype generation and for <b>the</b> way missing <b>data</b> occur. Under this model, we provide an algorithm, which takes an expected polynomial time. In tests on simulated data, our algorithm quickly resolves the genotypes under high rates of missing entries...|$|R
50|$|In statistics, {{analysis}} of rhythmic variance (ANORVA) {{is a method}} for detecting rhythms in biological time series, published by Peter Celec (Biol Res. 2004, 37(4 Suppl A):777-82). It is a procedure for detecting cyclic variations in biological time series and quantification of their probability. ANORVA {{is based on the}} premise that the variance in groups of data from rhythmic variables is low when a time distance of one period exists between <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>entries.</b>|$|R

40|$|Sophisticated {{decision}} support systems (DSS) can reduce preventable medical errors. A standalone DSS prototype {{was built to}} identify drug-disease mismatches in the electronic medical record (EMR). When drugs fail to match a known problem on the problem list (drug orphans), either the problem list is deficient or the drug was ordered in error. We tested the performance of an integrated DSS prototype by improving <b>the</b> <b>data</b> exchange with <b>the</b> standalone DSS prototype. By implementing a screen capture tool, {{we were able to}} accelerate <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> into <b>the</b> DSS prototype through the semi-automated operation.

50|$|<b>The</b> role of <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> clerks {{working with}} {{physical}} hand-written documents {{is on the}} decline in the developed world, because employees within a company frequently enter their own data, as it is collected now, instead of having a different employee do this task. An example of this is an operator working in a call center or a cashier in a shop. Cost is another reason for <b>the</b> decline. <b>Data</b> <b>entry</b> is labor-intensive for large batches and, therefore, expensive, so large companies will sometimes outsource the work to third world countries where {{there is no shortage of}} cheaper unskilled labor.|$|R

50|$|Enforcement action {{typically}} rejects <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> {{request and}} requires the input actor {{to make a}} change that brings the data into compliance. This is most suitable for interactive use, where a real person is sitting on the computer and making entry. It also works well for batch upload, where a file input may be rejected and a set of messages sent back to the input source for why the data is rejected.|$|E
50|$|Appraisers {{provide all}} the data needed to input in {{appraisal}} reports. A data entry team does the rest; it searches, consolidates and types the data into reports, such as subject data and comparable grid prior sales history. Most data entry organizations work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. The appraiser sends empty reports, and <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> team works all day and night, even while the appraiser is sleeping.
