500|$|Drake {{appears on}} Pink Moon {{accompanied}} {{only by his}} own carefully recorded guitar save for a single piano overdub on the title track. Wood later said: [...] "He was very determined to make this very stark, bare record. He definitely {{wanted it to be}} him more than anything. And I <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> ways, Pink Moon is probably more like Nick is than the other two records." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} in 1993, Folkvord said his most important commitment if he gained a seat in parliament was giving the National trade union centers more power {{so that they could}} better defend the working class. When asked if it was exhausting to promote socialist reforms Folkvord said, [...] "It is. But I <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> ways easier than before [...] fake socialist regimes have collapsed". Another opinion of his was that [...] "capitalism destroys the natural environment around us making the bourgeois society planners understand that there must be something new in the future. This provides inspiration to win support for socialist beliefs in Norway". Folkvord's first contact with anti-capitalist beliefs came when he joined the Workers' Communist Party. The party told him about [...] "capitalist barbarism" [...] and how the wealthy controlled everything. Folkvord said he believed that [...] " [...] can't be the end of human development", and that he believes humans are destined to create another more-just system.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film a perfect four-star rating, calling it [...] "the most cheerfully exciting, bizarre, goofy, romantic {{adventure}} movie since Raiders, {{and it is}} high praise to say that it's {{not so much a}} sequel as an equal. It's quite an experience." [...] Vincent Canby felt the film was [...] "too shapeless to be the fun that Raiders is, but shape may be beside the point. Old-time, 15-part movie serials didn't have shape. They just went on and on and on, which is what Temple of Doom does with humor and technical invention." [...] Neal Gabler commented that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> ways, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was better than Raiders of the Lost Ark. In some ways it was less. In sum total, I'd have to say I enjoyed it more. That doesn't mean it's better necessarily, but I got more enjoyment out of it." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune called the film [...] "sillier, darkly violent and a bit dumbed down, but still great fun." [...] Pauline Kael, writing in The New Yorker, claimed it was [...] "one of the most sheerly pleasurable physical comedies ever made." [...] Halliwell's Film Guide described the film as a [...] "slow-starting adventure romp with much ingenuity and too much brutality and horror." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{character}} {{is known for}} a number of catchphrases, many of which are chosen not just for comic effect, but to play on a perceived tendency of the self-help movement to talk and <b>think</b> <b>in</b> psychobabble. <b>Some,</b> such as the phrase [...] "stinkin' thinkin'", are taken from common 12-step slogans.|$|R
2500|$|We {{experience}} the world subjectively thus we create subjective representations of our experience. These subjective representations of experience are constituted {{in terms of}} five senses and language. That is to say our subjective conscious experience {{is in terms of}} the traditional senses of vision, audition, tactition, olfaction and gustation such that when we—for example—rehearse an activity [...] "in our heads", recall an event or anticipate the future we will [...] "see" [...] images, [...] "hear" [...] sounds, [...] "taste" [...] flavours, [...] "feel" [...] tactile sensations, [...] "smell" [...] odours and <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> (natural) language. [...] Furthermore it is claimed that these subjective representations of experience have a discernible structure, a pattern. It is in this sense that NLP is sometimes defined as the study of the structure of subjective experience.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 April, Yorke {{wrote on}} Radiohead's website: [...] "Yesterday we {{finished}} recording. I am free and happy and now I'm {{going for a}} walk in the park." [...] Having completed over 20 songs, the band considered releasing them as a series of EPs or a double LP, but struggled to find a track listing that satisfied them. O'Brien felt the material was too dense for a double album and that listeners might skip tracks. Instead, Radiohead saved many songs for their next album, Amnesiac, released the following year. Yorke said Radiohead split the work into two albums because [...] "they cancel each other out as overall finished things. They come from two different places, I <b>think...</b> <b>In</b> <b>some</b> weird way I think Amnesiac gives another take on Kid A, a form of explanation." [...] Kid A was mastered by Chris Blair in Abbey Road Studios, London.|$|E

25|$|I <b>think</b> that <b>in</b> <b>some</b> quarters, {{many parts}} of the country, a white male is really disadvantaged… Because we have {{developed}} this notion of women and minorities being so disadvantaged and we have to help them, that we have, in many cases, twisted the thing so that it's no longer a case of equal opportunity.

60|$|We may now {{return to}} the purpose of our awkward {{parenthesis}} about the praise of the future and the failures of the past. A house of his own being the obvious ideal for every man, we may now ask (taking this need as typical of all such needs) why he hasn't got it; and whether it is in any philosophical sense his own fault. Now, I <b>think</b> that <b>in</b> <b>some</b> philosophical sense it is his own fault, I <b>think</b> <b>in</b> a yet more philosophical sense it is the fault of his philosophy. And this is what I have now to attempt to explain.|$|R
25|$|I am {{sometimes}} {{inclined to}} <b>think</b> that <b>in</b> <b>some</b> parts - not all - of the Commonwealth, the old-fashioned traditional, and almost instinctive, standard of fair play {{to be observed}} by the Crown in dealing with subjects, which I learned a very long time ago to regard as elementary, is either not known or thought out of date.

"I've got a {{very good}} one; I <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> respects it's rather better," [...] said Lord Warburton, who as yet had not spoken, but who had kept an {{attentive}} eye upon Miss Archer.

60|$|Especially {{this is to}} be regretted in {{the effect}} {{produced}} on the schools of line engraving, which had reached in England an executive skill of a kind before unexampled, and which of late have lost much of their more sterling and legitimate methods. Still, I have seen plates produced quite recently, more beautiful, I <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> qualities than anything ever before attained by the burin: and I have not the slightest fear that photography, or any other adverse or competitive operation, will in the least ultimately diminish,--I believe they will, on the contrary, stimulate and exalt--the grand old powers of the wood and the steel.|$|E
5000|$|Farrell is a {{supporter}} of regulation of large banks. In an interview with National Public Radio, she stated: [...] "We have created them, and we're sort of past that point, and I <b>think</b> that <b>in</b> <b>some</b> sense, the genie's {{out of the bottle}} {{and what we need to}} do is to manage them and to oversee them, as opposed to hark back to a time that we're unlikely to ever come back to or want to come back to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is," [...] said my grandmother, [...] "Sister Hagar, of the House of Martha. She was Sylvia Raynor, of New Haven.

As you ascend Kirkstone from Paterdale, you have a bright stream leaping down from rock to rock, on your right, with here and there silent pools. One of Wordsworth's poor neighbours worked all the week over Kirkstone, I <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> mines; and returning on Saturday evenings, used to fish up this little stream. We met him {{with a string of}} small trout. W. offered to buy them, and bid him take them to the Mount. 'Nay,' said the man, 'I cannot sell them, Sir; the little children at home look for them for supper, and I can't disappoint them.' It was quite pleasant to see how the man's answer delighted the Poet. J.T.C.|$|E
60|$|The {{reports of}} the debates in the Houses of Parliament are {{constantly}} growing smaller and smaller in our newspapers. Perhaps this is partly because the speeches are growing duller and duller. I <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> degree the two things act and re-act on each other. For fear of the newspapers politicians are dull, and at last they are too dull even for the newspapers. The speeches in our time are more careful and elaborate, because they {{are meant to be}} read, and not to be heard. And exactly because they are more careful and elaborate, they are not so likely to be worthy of a careful and elaborate report. They are not interesting enough. So the moral cowardice of modern politicians has, after all, some punishment attached to it by the silent anger of heaven. Precisely because our political speeches are meant to be reported, they are not worth reporting. Precisely because they are carefully designed to be read, nobody reads them.|$|E
60|$|My wife {{answered}} in her quiet way, setting forth her doctrine of a plain average {{to go through}} the whole establishment, placing parlors, chambers, kitchen, pantries, and the unseen depths of linen-closets in harmonious relations of just proportion, and showed by calm estimates how far the sum given could go towards this result. There the limits were inexorable. There is nothing so damping to the ardor of youthful economies as the hard, positive logic of figures. It is so delightful to <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> airy way that the things we like best are the cheapest, and that a sort of rigorous duty compels us to get them at any sacrifice. There is no remedy for this illusion but to show by the multiplication and addition tables what things are and are not possible. My wife's figures met Aunt Easygo's assertions, and there was a lull among the high contracting parties for a season; nevertheless, I could see Jenny was secretly uneasy. I began to hear of journeys made to far places, here and there, where expensive articles of luxury were selling at reduced prices. Now a gilded mirror was discussed, and now a velvet carpet which chance had brought down temptingly near the sphere of financial possibility. I thought of our parlor, and prayed the good fairies to avert the advent of ill-assorted articles.|$|E
