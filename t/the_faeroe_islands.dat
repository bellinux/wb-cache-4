40|$|The SRES A 1 B {{scenario}} {{for the period}} 2072 – 2097 with the Bergen Climate Model (BCM) has been downscaled for the marine climate in the North Sea using the Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS). The results are compared to the 20 C 3 M run for the period 1972 – 1997. The results show a warming of the North Sea, with a volume average of 1. 4 ◦C, and a mean SST change of 1. 7 ◦C. The warming is strongest in May–June. Geographically the strongest warming in the North Sea is found towards Skagerrak–Kattegat in the surface waters and in the central North Sea at 50 m depth. The downscaling show a weak increase in the Atlantic inflow to the North Sea. The BCM scenario has {{a change in the}} wind stress pattern in <b>the</b> <b>Faeroe</b> <b>Island</b> region. This strengthens the branch of Atlantic Water flowing west of the Faeroes and weakens the flux through the Faeroe–Shetland Channel.

40|$|Abstract: The kinorhynch genus Paracentrophyes {{currently}} {{consists of}} two species only: P. quadridentatus (Zelinka, 1928) from the Mediterranean Sea and P. praedictus Higgins, 1983 from Belize in the Caribbean. Both species have until now been recorded from their type localities only. In the present contribution a new species of Paracentrophyes, P. anurus sp. nov., is described from the Korea Strait. The species can be recognized by details in the mouth cone morphology, absence of perispinal setae in segment 10, and absence of a midterminal process in both sexes. Female specimens are furthermore characterized {{by the presence of}} an extraordinary long middorsal spine on segment 10, whereas males possess a midterminal type 3 sensory spot. Besides the recording of the new species, the occurrence of P. cf. quadridentatus is reported from two localities in <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean (<b>Faeroe</b> <b>Islands</b> and Spain). <b>The</b> recorded specimens are described in detail, based on combined examinations with LM and SEM, and diagnostic traits for all three species of Paracentrophyes are discussed in light of the newly acquired information.

25|$|Periodically, {{velocities}} {{may increase}} dramatically or even reverse due to atmospheric storms raising the local surface eddy kinetic energy, which gets partially transmitted down to abyssal depths in episodes called benthic storms. These velocities may reach magnitudes well above 40cm/s and vary significantly {{depending on the}} specific location. At the lower continental rise, south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and at the lower slope around <b>the</b> <b>Faeroe</b> <b>Islands</b> these velocities may reach up to 73cm/s and 75cm/s, respectively. Bottom-current flow velocities have been measured as high as 300cm/s in the Strait of Gibraltar. These benthic storms occur only 5 to 10 times per year and usually last between 3 and 5 days, but that is enough to heavily erode benthic sediment and keep the finer grains in suspension even after flow velocities return to normal and the bedload has been deposited. During benthic storms, the eroded sediment may be transported over thousands of kilometers and deposited rather quickly (i.e. ~1.5cm/month) once the storm wanes. However, the net sedimentation rate over thousands of years may be much smaller (i.e. ~5.5cm/year) due to the intense periods of erosion during benthic storms.|$|E

Cunningham took steps to suppress the signal and continued on his way. According to a Norwegian history there were 461 passengers on board and Cunningham showed the signal to King Haakon who asked what his orders were: Cunningham replied, 'to bring you safely to England'. The King later remarked, 'I realised this was not to Admiral Cunningham's liking'. Cunningham was mentioned in despatches on 11 July 1940.|$|E
