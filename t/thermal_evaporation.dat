40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this work}} is {{studying}} surface topography and optical properties of organic thin films of TiOPc and PTCDA blends deposited by <b>thermal</b> vacuum <b>evaporation.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Thin films of blends of organic materials are provided as donor/acceptor couples in bulk heterojunction based organic solar cells. Thin films of TiOPc - PTCDA mixture have been deposited by <b>thermal</b> vacuum <b>evaporation</b> from one source with various ratios of blends components and deposition rates used. Both the chemical composition and technological parameters of the deposition process have appeared to influence on optical properties, UV-Vis absorption spectra in particular, and surface morphology of the as-prepared thin films.
