40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to propose a sound interpretative and policy {{framework}} for ‘Inner Peripheries’ at the EU level. Its ambition is to bridge conceptual approaches to peripherality with the policy objectives set by key documents such as the Territorial Agenda 2020 and other recent reports on economic, social and territorial cohesion. An integrated multi-scalar approach, grounded on the notion of spatial disparity, is therefore connected with a ‘place-based’ approach to policy design. The breakthrough experience of the Italian programme on Inner Areas is an opportunity to broaden the reflection on inner peripheries and policies that are most apt to reconnect them. A more comprehensive analytical framework is proposed here, which looks at the foundational economy, spatial justice and territorial cohesion. The framework deals with both the ‘condition’ of peripherality and the ‘process’ by which endogenous and exogenous drivers determine the marginalisation of specific territories. Such tenets are fleshed out in the development of an original approach bridging theory and practice, analysis and policy, crucially assuming multi-scale governance design as <b>the</b> <b>enabling</b> <b>framework</b> for greater coherence between top-down and community-led initiatives. </p...|$|E

40|$|Rio+ 20 : A {{pledge to}} phase out fossil-fuel {{subsidies}} Fossil-fuel subsidy reform has become an international priority. Already, 53 countries in the G- 20 and APEC forums have committed to phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies over the medium term,  and the European Commission (EC) is recommending that the reform of environmentally harmful subsidies be a priority for the Rio+ 20 Conference. Rio+ 20 —the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development—is scheduled for June 4 – 6, 2012, and negotiating time is running short. Expectations  are low that the conference will deliver a major new agreement or binding commitments. The International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) believes that an innovative approach is required to make Rio+ 20 a success. The IISD recommends that Rio+ 20 focus on a few high-impact initiatives that will help create <b>the</b> <b>enabling</b> <b>framework</b> for sustainable development.

40|$|Brazil, {{the host}} of the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, is known for strong {{competitive}} traditions in sports and games. It is also one of only three G- 20 countries (together with Saudi Arabia and Indonesia) that currently bans non-state provision of gambling products. Bingo was a notable exception to this prohibition, after enabling legislation was enacted in 1993, with the intention that proceeds would help fund national sports development. The game quickly became very popular but there were persistent questions about, and contestations over, the capacity of the regulatory framework to control the dual risks of exploitation of bingo consumers, and corruption of politicians and public officials by bingo entrepreneurs. By the mid- 2000 s <b>the</b> <b>enabling</b> <b>framework</b> had been abandoned and the game returned to the domain of illegality. Brazilian judges played an active and prominent role in the regulation of bingo during the shifts from prohibition to legalisation and back to prohibition. This paper critically and contextually analyses the complexities of judicial engagement with bingo regulation, focusing in particular on the ways that Brazilian judges have deployed social, economic, and political considerations to justify both permission and prohibition of commercial bingo houses. Recognising that contradictory and incoherent judicial decision-making is not unique to bingo law, the paper seeks to understand how the judiciary contributes to the governance of gambling in a setting where corruption is constructed as endemic...|$|E

Today’s transportation operations rely on static procedures instead of being actively controlled to achieve effective synchronization of the actors’ operations, resulting in slow responses to events and long waiting times in the transportation setup. Information availability is a prerequisite to control and plan freight transportation operations. Literature covers several studies on information sharing between suppliers and customers, but studies involving the transport operators are few. Together with the shortcomings of today’s transportation setups, this calls for models on increased use, availability and sharing of information between actors. This thesis {{is based on an}} extensive information requirements study involving all the actors in an international transportation setup. An in-depth study of the involved actors was carried out and the requirements of effective transportation operations were extracted through literature studies, interviews, observations and document studies. The main contribution is a model of effective transportation operations and an enabling framework. Some of the results, including the framework, have previously been published in the three appended papers. The requirements analysis, the model of effective transportation operations and <b>the</b> <b>enabling</b> <b>framework</b> were mainly validated through a demonstration prototype and a validation case. The results indicate that transportation operations have a large potential for improvement in several stages of the setup.

40|$|The {{magnitude}} of the housing problem in Nigeria is immense; the current deficit is around 12 to 16 million units. Government attempts to address housing availability has been a recurring theme throughout Nigeria's history. Yet, many government led interventions of direct provision {{have been unable to}} significantly impact access to and supply of housing for low and moderate income populations. While messy political realities are acknowledged as contributing to the failure of many of these past housing programs, the analysis of the necessary solutions are more focused on financial and property rights institutions, the broad economic environment and physical capital. Articulating the solutions to the challenges around housing production and access in Nigeria in this way, has led to the embrace and official endorsement of the "enabling" framework, which advances private sector participation in the housing market through prioritizing the aforementioned "necessary solutions," as critical to solving Nigeria's housing access issues. This thesis explores the "enabling" approach to housing by investigating one particular program in Nigeria, the Abuja Mass Housing Scheme (MHS). On paper, the MHS seems to adopt this framework as a mechanism for strengthening housing supply and demand in Abuja, Nigeria. This thesis explores the challenges that have been encountered in the MHS with a particular emphasis on understanding why the "enabling" framework as implemented in this case has not worked? The sub-questions include: What might the application of <b>the</b> <b>enabling</b> <b>framework</b> for housing in the Abuja MHS suggest about the challenges of the approach? What is required to actually make "enabling" work in a context like Nigeria? This thesis tries to answer these questions through applying a historical exploration of why and how Abuja was created and an analysis of the land institutions that deeply impact the housing development process in Abuja to an investigation of the MHS. The analysis of the MHS suggests that applications of the "enabling" framework need to aggressively consider the political realities on the ground in order to have any chance at working. This thesis argues that the "enabling" literature seems to have overemphasized market functions to the exclusion of politics, governance and accountability and that if politics are not considered in the framing or embrace of the "enabling approach" the intended impact of the framework cannot be successfully achieved. Moreover, it argues that the attempts to implement an "enabling approach" ought to be grounded in a deep analysis of which actors are being enabled and the potential unintended consequences of this. by Nse Umoh.

40|$|Although since 2000 the Government {{embarked}} on a systematic process to establish building blocks upon which an independent supported living policy framework can be built, this report concludes that to date there is an absence of a cohesive and universal policy for independent supported living for disabled persons towards which the primary stakeholders – that is the Government, Non Government Organisations, the parents and families, and, more importantly, the disabled persons themselves - are working towards to. There is also an absence of data relating to {{all aspects of the}} disability sector – data without which good policy design is difficult to attain. Indeed, the absence of such a cohesive and universal independent living policy framework is, perhaps, best attested by parents of disabled persons who fear what the future holds for their children as they become frailer or pass away. Through Aġenzija Sapport, the Government in the 2000 s adopted an aggressive process to establish independent supported living placements for disabled persons. The focus of Aġenzija Sapport was, primarily to set up state run independent supported living home placements as well as in partnering with church foundations in this regard. There is now a need for a reform of <b>the</b> <b>enabling</b> <b>framework</b> to facilitate, support and simulate supported independent living for disabled persons. There is also a need for reforms to the Social Security Act, the Income Tax Act, or to the handling of Capital Tax Gains of income generated by private trusts established by parents for their disabled children and other policy measures directed to encourage individual parents to finance through their savings the placement of their disabled children in an independent supported living environment. Indeed, the Schedule V of the Social Security Act continues to penalize a disabled person who has means beyond the limited thresholds set – means which the disabled person could be receiving through a private trust. In short, there was no policy-driven change directed to support families to invest in the well being of their disabled children by setting up independent supported living environments for them; and in doing so removing the quasi total dependence that the fulfillment of such an aspiration is solely dependent on a placement, within the Government’s small stock of independent supported living placements, becoming available. The phrase quasi total dependence is carefully chosen. As this report shows an independent supported living environment with a basic level of care – 2 hours of individual personal assisted support – is estimated to cost annually € 17, 854 whilst one with an intensive level of care – 12 hours of individual personal assisted support – is estimated to cost annually € 44, 910. This report concludes that, even at the most basic level of care, private financing of an independent supported living placement for a disabled person, under current legislative conditions and constraints, is beyond the reach of most families. Therefore, for a total financial budget of € 4, 097, 000 between 2002 and 2006, the Agency invested in 441 independent supported living placements. This compares strongly with the investment in 16 independent supported living home placements since 2007, where the total financial budget for the Agency - excluding a constant expenditure base of € 3, 469, 000 for Day Services – stood at € 12, 080, 000. Thus, the Agency between 2002 and 2006 opened a residential independent supported living placement for every € 93, 114 of the budget allocated to it when compared to an independent supported living placement for every € 755, 000 of the budget allocated to it excluding the Day Care financial estimates) since 2007. The report presents the following recommendations with regards to the building of a robust and sustained cohesive and universal policy framework for independent supported living for disabled persons.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{was to develop a}} {{framework}} for modeling relevant environmental performance metrics and objectively simulating the future environmental impacts of aviation given the evolution of the fleet, the development of new technologies, and the expansion of airports. By exchanging fidelity for computational speed, a screening-level framework for assessing aviation's environmental impacts can be developed to observe new insights on fleet-level trends and inform environmental mitigation strategies. This was accomplished by developing per class average ``generic-vehicle" models that can reduce the fleet to a few representative aircraft models for predicting fleet results with reasonable accuracy. The method for Generating Emissions and Noise, Evaluating Residuals and using Inverse method for Choosing the best Alternatives (GENERICA) expands a previous generic vehicle formulation to additionally match DNL contours across a subset of airports. Designs of experiments, surrogate models, Monte Carlo simulations, and ``desirability" scores were combined to set the vehicle design parameters and reduce the mean relative error across the subset of airports. Results show these vehicle models more accurately represented contours at busy airports operating a wide variety of aircraft as compared to a traditional representative-in-class approach. Additionally, a rapid method for assessing population exposure counts was developed and incorporated into the noise tool, and the generic vehicles demonstrated accuracy with respect to population exposure counts for the actual fleet in the baseline year. The capabilities of <b>the</b> <b>enabled</b> <b>framework</b> were demonstrated to show fleet-level trends and explore placement of new runways at capacity constrained airports. Ph. D...|$|R
