5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation: it rotates {{about its}} axis {{in about the}} same <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to orbit Earth.

5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} can {{be placed}} into one of three groups by its elimination half-life, or <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> for the body to eliminate half of the dose. Some benzodiazepines have long-acting active metabolites, such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, which are metabolised into desmethyldiazepam. Desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 36–200 hours, and flurazepam, with the main active metabolite of desalkylflurazepam, with a half-life of 40–250 hours. These long-acting metabolites are partial agonists.|$|E

5|$|Frequency scaling was the {{dominant}} reason for improvements in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004. The runtime {{of a program}} {{is equal to the}} number of instructions multiplied by the average time per instruction. Maintaining everything else constant, increasing the clock frequency decreases the average <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to execute an instruction. An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime for all compute-bound programs.|$|E
5|$|The {{gravitational}} attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth. The {{same effect}} on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period {{is the same as}} the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminator.|$|E

5|$|Adults who {{do believe}} that zero is even can {{nevertheless}} be unfamiliar with thinking of it as even, enough so to measurably slow them down in a reaction time experiment. Stanislas Dehaene, {{a pioneer in the}} field of numerical cognition, led a series of such experiments in the early 1990s. A numeral or a number word is flashed to the subject on a monitor, and a computer records the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> the subject to push one of two buttons to identify the number as odd or even. The results showed that 0 was slower to process than other even numbers. Some variations of the experiment found delays as long as 60 milliseconds or about 10% of the average reaction time—a small difference but a significant one.|$|E

5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} {{only when the}} Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse limit. In the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> for the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E

5|$|If a {{laser beam}} is swept quickly across a distant object, the spot of light can move faster thanc, {{although}} the initial movement of the spot is delayed because of the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> light {{to get to the}} distant object at the speedc. However, the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speedc from the laser to the various positions of the spot. Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move faster thanc, after a delay in time. In neither case does any matter, energy, or information travel faster than light.|$|E

At a demonstration event Tesla showed that a battery swap operation with the Model S takes just over 90 seconds, about half the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to refill a gasoline-powered car used for comparison purposes during the event. The first stations are planned to be deployed along Interstate 5 in California where, according to Tesla, {{a large number of}} Model S sedans make the San Francisco-Los Angeles trip regularly. These will be followed by the Washington, DC to Boston corridor.|$|E
5|$|The Moon makes a {{complete}} orbit around Earth {{with respect to}} the fixed stars about once every 27.3days (its sidereal period). However, because Earth is moving in its orbit around the Sun at the same <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> slightly longer for the Moon to show the same phase to Earth, which is about 29.5days (its synodic period). Unlike most satellites of other planets, the Moon orbits closer to the ecliptic plane than to the planet's equatorial plane. The Moon's orbit is subtly perturbed by the Sun and Earth in many small, complex and interacting ways. For example, the plane of the Moon's orbit gradually rotates once every 18.61 years, which affects other aspects of lunar motion. These follow-on effects are mathematically described by Cassini's laws.|$|E

5|$|A {{white dwarf}} is very hot when it forms, {{but because it}} has no source of energy, it will {{gradually}} radiate its energy and cool. This means that its radiation, which initially has a high color temperature, will lessen and redden with time. Over a very long time, a white dwarf will cool and its material will begin to crystallize (starting with the core). The star's low temperature means it will no longer emit significant heat or light, and {{it will become a}} cold black dwarf. Because the length of <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years), it is thought that no black dwarfs yet exist. The oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvins.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 b is in a 1:2:4 Laplace {{resonance}} {{with the}} inner planet Gliese 876 c {{and the outer}} planet Gliese 876 e: in the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> planet e to complete one orbit, planet b completes two and planet c completes four. This is the second known example of a Laplace resonance, the first being Jupiter's moons Io, Europa and Ganymede. As a result, the orbital elements of the planets change fairly rapidly as they dynamically interact with one another. The planet's orbit has a low eccentricity, similar to the planets in the Solar System. The semimajor axis of the orbit is only 0.208 AU, {{less than that of}} Mercury in the Solar System. However Gliese 876 is such a faint star that this puts it in the outer part of the habitable zone.|$|E
5|$|The account {{published}} in Journal des sçavans {{was based on}} a report that Rømer read to the French Academy of Sciences in November 1676 (Cohen, 1940, p.346). When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from it. The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being the diameter of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference in the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. Rømer observed this effect for Jupiter's innermost moon Io and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's orbit.|$|E

5|$|The two-colored bolete is an edible mushroom, {{although}} some {{may have an}} allergic reaction after ingestion that results in stomach upset. The mushroom has a very mild to no taste although {{it is said to}} have a very distinctive taste like that of the king bolete. It can be cooked several ways, and the varying color of the cap can be used to determine if the mushroom is ready to be eaten. If the cap is a lighter red, then it is less mature and is in a stage where it is often larva infested or it can be soft fleshed, in some cases both. The cap should have a dark brick red color when safe to eat. Drying the two-colored bolete is a good method for storage. It is important to note the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> for the two-colored bolete to bruise when identifying it for consumption; the mushroom should take several minutes to bruise compared to the instant bruising of Boletus sensibilis, which is poisonous and has many of the same visual characteristics of the two-colored bolete.|$|E
5|$|The young may all hatch in {{a single}} night. Crocodilians are unusual among {{reptiles}} {{in the amount of}} parental care provided after the young hatch. The mother helps excavate hatchlings from the nest and carries them to water in her mouth. Newly hatched crocodilians gather together and stay close to their mother. For spectacled caimans in the Venezuelan llanos, individual mothers are known to leave their young in the same nurseries, or crèches, and one of the mothers guards them. Hatchlings of many species tend to bask in a group during the day and disperse at nightfall to feed. The <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> young crocodilians to reach independence can vary. For American alligators, groups of young associate with adults for one to two years, while juvenile saltwater and Nile crocodiles become independent in a few months.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial growth follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the lag phase, a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the log phase, {{also known as the}} logarithmic or exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.|$|E
