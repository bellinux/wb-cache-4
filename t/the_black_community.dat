5|$|One night, {{a pair of}} LAPD {{officers}} come in {{to speak}} to Sweetback's boss, Beetle (Simon Chuckster). A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community</b> {{to bring in a}} suspect. The police ask permission to arrest Sweetback, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence, in order to appease <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community.</b> Beetle agrees, and the officers arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers arrest a young Black Panther named Mu-Mu (Hubert Scales). They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu's wrist, and beat him. In response, Sweetback uses the handcuffs, still hanging from his wrist, to beat the officers into unconsciousness.|$|E
5|$|Race {{relations}} were tense during the Reconstruction era, as whites resisted freedmen {{being allowed to}} choose their labor, vote, and have freedom of movement. Following a fire that damaged many businesses, the riot of 1871 erupted, with whites attacking blacks in the community. <b>The</b> <b>black</b> <b>community</b> had expanded after the war, as people moved to the city for more opportunity and to create community away from white supervision.|$|E

In 2004, a U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ) investigation found that Cracker Barrel discriminated against minority customers; patrons complained of racially segregated seating and service quality. In an agreement with the USDOJ, Cracker Barrel implemented non-discrimination policies and pledged to focus on improving minority representation and civic involvement, particularly in <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community.</b> Company shareholders added sexual orientation to the company's non-discrimination policy in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Fear of a Black Planet {{features}} elaborate sound collages {{that incorporate}} varying rhythms, numerous samples, media sound bites, and eccentric loops, reflecting the songs' confrontational tone.

Fear of a Black Planet explores themes about organization and empowerment within <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community,</b> social issues affecting African Americans, and race relations at the time. The record's criticism of institutional racism, White supremacy, and the power elite was partly inspired by Dr. Frances Cress Welsing's views on color.|$|E

According to Hicks, it is not just that gumbo is a cultural and historical food in <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community,</b> but that it continues to foster that community through its flavors, colors and eating methods, which are usually in large groups where it can be shared among many people.|$|E

However, Georgia law requires a majority; if no majority is reached by a candidate, the two top vote-getters must face {{one another in a}} runoff. On August 5, 2008 Jones lost the run-off election to Jim Martin by a margin of 20 points. Jones unexpectedly lost to Martin in his home base of Dekalb County. Jones had lost support within <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community</b> before the runoff election, and only captured two-thirds of the black vote in the head to head match up against Martin. The black turnout in the run-off was also substantially lower than the initial primary election, further hurting Vernon Jones' chances in the runoff.|$|E

The mob burned the Douglas County Courthouse to get the prisoner, causing more than $1,000,000 damage. They hanged and shot Will Brown, then burned his body.

5|$|While the BPC was {{primarily}} political, Black Consciousness activists also established <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Community</b> Programmes (BCPs) {{to focus on}} improving healthcare and education and fostering black economic self-reliance. The BCPs had strong ecumenical links, being part-funded by a program on Christian action, established by the Christian Institute of Southern Africa and the South African Council of Churches. Additional funds came from the Anglo-American Corporation, the International University Exchange Fund, and Scandinavian churches. In 1972, the BCP hired Biko and Bokwe Mafuna, allowing Biko to continue his political and community work. In September 1972, Biko visited Kimberley, where he met the PAC founder and anti-apartheid activist Robert Sobukwe.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as {{a teacher at the}} ICY, White closely collaborated with Octavius Catto, an {{important}} civil rights activist and long-time friend of White's who shared a similar social group and views on education. Both men, former cricket players at the ICY, believed baseball was another outlet for African Americans to promote social reform and prove their right for full citizenship. In the spring of 1866, White and Catto established the Philadelphia Pythians, a baseball club composed mainly of men from the Knights of Pythias fraternal organization. Catto, a hard-hitting shortstop and second baseman, was the de facto captain on the field, while White became the team's secretary, responsible for scheduling games, arranging festivities, and recording statistics. Soon, Pythian games became a popular fixture of <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E

5|$|Estes' {{organization}} {{attracted a}} $3,000 donation from Anita Bryant, and her pastor traveled to Seattle to give advice on Estes' campaign. However, where Estes {{planned to use}} the network of conservative churches in the city, many members were discouraged from working with {{him because he was}} a Mormon. The tone of the advertising for the campaign was more dire than in Miami; ads claimed homosexuals were responsible for half the murders and suicides in major cities and half the cases of syphilis. Perhaps the most significant factor of the campaign was Estes' co-chair, a police officer named Dennis Falk. Two months before election day, Falk shot and killed a suspect {{who turned out to be}} a black, mentally retarded, young boy. <b>The</b> <b>black</b> <b>community</b> was furious with Falk, and transferred their anger to Initiative Thirteen.|$|E
5|$|The 1970s, however, {{witnessed}} {{the publication of}} revisionist studies that departed from the traditional historiography of slavery.

Genovese's Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made (1974), Peter H.

Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom, 1750–1925 (1976), and Lawrence W. Levine's Black Culture and Black Consciousness: Afro-American Folk Thought from Slavery to Freedom (1977). One of the more controversial of these studies was John W. Blassingame's The Slave Community.|$|E
5|$|Despite Governor Catts' {{change of}} attitude, white mob action {{frequently}} occurred in towns throughout north and central Florida and went unchecked by local law enforcement. Extrajudicial violence against black residents was so common that it seldom {{was covered by}} newspapers. In 1920, whites removed four black men from jail, who were suspects accused of raping a white woman in Macclenny, and lynched them. In Ocoee the same year, two black citizens armed themselves {{to go to the}} polls during an election. A confrontation ensued and two white election officials were shot, after which a white mob destroyed Ocoee's black community, causing as many as 30 deaths, and destroying 25 homes, two churches, and a Masonic Lodge. Just weeks before the Rosewood massacre, the Perry Race Riot occurred on 14 and 15 December 1922, in which whites burned Charles Wright at the stake and attacked <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community</b> of Perry, Florida after a white schoolteacher was murdered. On the day following Wright's lynching, whites shot and hanged two more black men in Perry; next they burned the town's black school, Masonic lodge, church, amusement hall, and several families' homes.|$|E
