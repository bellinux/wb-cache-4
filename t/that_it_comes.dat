5|$|The Hideous Sun Demon (sometimes {{billed as}} The Sun Demon, {{or in the}} UK as Blood on His Lips) is a 1958 science-fiction horror film written, {{directed}} and produced by Robert Clarke, who also starred in the film. It also stars Patricia Manning, Nan Peterson, Patrick Whyte and Fred La Porta. The film focuses on a scientist (portrayed by Clarke) who is exposed to a radioactive isotope and soon finds out <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> with horrifying consequences.|$|E
5|$|The most usual {{explanation}} for {{the origin of the}} name Widnes is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the Danish words vid, meaning wide, and noese, meaning nose and that it refers to the promontory projecting into the River Mersey. However, the Widnes promontory is not particularly wide and another possible explanation is the first part derives from the Danish ved, meaning a wood and possibly referring to a tree-covered promontory. Earlier spellings of the name have been Vidnes, Wydnes and Wydness.|$|E
5|$|Cerium is {{the second}} element of the {{lanthanide}} series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides lanthanum to its left and praseodymium to its right, and above the actinide thorium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness {{similar to that of}} silver. Its 58 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4f15d16s2, of which the four outer electrons are valence electrons. Immediately after lanthanum, the 4f orbitals suddenly contract and are lowered in energy {{to the point that they}} participate readily in chemical reactions; however, this effect is not yet strong enough at cerium and thus the 5d subshell is still occupied. Most lanthanides can use only three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: cerium is an exception because of the stability of the empty f-shell in Ce4+ and the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough until neodymium to allow the removal of the fourth valence electron.|$|E

5|$|Many households, {{and some}} small communities, rely on {{rainwater}} for their drinking water supplies. Roof-fed systems are highly vulnerable to contamination by ashfall, {{as they have}} a large surface area relative to the storage tank volume. In these cases, leaching of chemical contaminants from the ashfall can become a health risk and drinking of water is not recommended. Prior to an ashfall, downpipes should be disconnected so that water in the tank is protected. A further {{problem is that the}} surface coating of fresh volcanic ash can be acidic. Unlike most surface waters, rainwater generally has a very low alkalinity (acid-neutralising capacity) and thus ashfall may acidify tank waters. This may lead to problems with plumbosolvency, whereby the water is more aggressive towards materials <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> into contact with. This can be a particular problem if there are lead-head nails or lead flashing used on the roof, and for copper pipes and other metallic plumbing fittings.|$|E

25|$|The grubber is more {{commonly}} used in a similar play. The grubber kick is commonly performed when close to the in-goal area; the grubber kick causes the ball to roll along the ground which at times, makes the ball jump up into a perfect catching position, easier than catching a punt or other kick. The rolling on the ground gives chasers more opportunities to regather the ball, rather than waiting for the ball to fall back to earth. The rolling also slows down the ball, allowing the kicker to place the kick so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> to rest inside the in-goal area.|$|E
25|$|In {{several of}} Plato's dialogues, Socrates promulgates {{the idea that}} {{knowledge}} {{is a matter of}} recollection, and not of learning, observation, or study. He maintains this view somewhat at his own expense, because in many dialogues, Socrates complains of his forgetfulness. Socrates is often found arguing that knowledge is not empirical, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from divine insight. In many middle period dialogues, such as the Phaedo, Republic and Phaedrus Plato advocates a belief in the immortality of the soul, and several dialogues end with long speeches imagining the afterlife. More than one dialogue contrasts knowledge and opinion, perception and reality, nature and custom, and body and soul.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that food and environmental antigens (bacterial, viral, or plant antigens) have epitopes similar enough to A and B glycoprotein antigens. The antibodies created against these environmental antigens {{in the first years}} of life can cross-react with ABO-incompatible red blood cells <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> in contact with during blood transfusion later in life. Anti-A antibodies are hypothesized to originate from immune response towards influenza virus, whose epitopes are similar enough to the α-D-N-galactosamine on the A glycoprotein to be able to elicit a cross-reaction. Anti-B antibodies are hypothesized to originate from antibodies produced against Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, cross-reacting with the α-D-galactose on the B glycoprotein.|$|E

25|$|Wind {{and water}} {{pollination}} require {{the production of}} vast quantities of pollen because of the chancy nature of its deposition. If they {{are not to be}} reliant on the wind or water (for aquatic species), plants need pollinators to move their pollen grains from one plant to another. They particularly need pollinators to consistently choose flowers of the same species, so they have evolved different lures to encourage specific pollinators to maintain fidelity to the same species. The attractions offered are mainly nectar, pollen, fragrances and oils. The ideal pollinating insect is hairy (so that pollen adheres to it), and spends time exploring the flower so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> into contact with the reproductive structures.|$|E
25|$|This {{purchase}} {{paved the}} way for the founding of the village at Bergen (Bergen Square). Permission was granted by Stuyvesant to the establish a village; the town was officially settled in 1660. There are various opinions as to the origin of the name given by the European settlers. Some say that it so called for any of number of towns in the Netherlands or the city in Norway Others believe it comes from the word bergen, which in the Germanic languages of northern Europe means hills, and could describe a most distinct geological feature of the region, The Palisades. Yet another interpretation is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the Dutch word bergen, meaning to save or to recover, prompted by the settlers' return after they had fled attacks by the native population.|$|E
25|$|The name Burra Burra {{has been}} {{asserted}} {{to have come}} from numerous sources. As early as July 1843, when the locality was already a sheep outstation for pastoralist William Peter of Manoora, it was known as Burrow Creek. Despite that obvious (though misspelt) connection to the indigenous Ngadjuri people, a later theory persistently postulates <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the Hindustani for ‘great great’, used by Indians shepherds working for another early pastoralist, James Stein, to refer to creek. The name could also have come from Stein's home country of Scotland or a number of Aboriginal languages. A so-called '' was discovered in 1851 in Devon in the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape; possibly coincidentally several ancient placenames such as Burrator in Devon and Burraton in Cornwall occur nearby; also possible origins for the name. A Burra Burra mine is located in Tennessee and named after the Australian one.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} this word is {{debatable}} {{as there are}} several possibilities. One is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> from Arabic (faranj) via Malay traders.

As with many Khmer words of foreign origin, ns often change to an ng sound. Such as Aleurmâng (...) (German) which comes from the French word Allemand.|$|R

25|$|The {{provenance}} of {{the helmet}} is unknown, but on stylistic grounds {{it is thought}} likely <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the north of England, {{in the area of}} Britain controlled by the Brigantes tribe. The helmet is first recorded as part of the collection of arms and armour accumulated by Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick (1783–1848), and so must have been discovered some time before 1848. It is possible that the helmet came from the Stanwick Hoard of about 140 bronze objects that was found some time between 1843 and 1845 near Stanwick Camp in North Yorkshire, which may have been the oppidum of the Brigantes. After Meyrick's death the helmet and other items of Iron Age armour, such as the Witham Shield, were left to his cousin, Lt. Colonel Augustus Meyrick, who disposed of them between 1869 and 1872. The helmet was purchased by Augustus Franks, an independently wealthy antiquarian who worked for the British Museum. Franks donated the helmet to the British Museum in 1872.|$|E
25|$|Joglo roof is {{the most}} {{characteristically}} Javanese roof form and the most complex. Joglo roof {{is associated with the}} residences of nobility, traditionally reserved for Javanese palace (kraton, official residence, government estate, and the house of Javanese aristocrats (ningrat). The main roof is much steeper and the four ridge greatly reduced in length. Joglo roof does not use king posts as does the limasan or kampung roof, rather the four innermost main house columns are sometimes taller than the outer ones. These four innermost house columns support a roof that is the steepest of all type of Javanese roof; almost forming a pyramid, except <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> to two points rather than a single one. These four innermost main house columns is surmounted by a unique structural element known as tumpang sari. A tumpang sari is basically layered beams structure; the outermost band of beams support the rafters of both the upper and lower roofs, while the heavily-ornate inner band of beams create a vaulted ceiling {{in the form of an}} inverted stepped pyramid. The basic joglo-type houses can also be increased in size by adding extra columns and extending the roof area outwards.|$|E
25|$|Still he {{maintained}} that virtue alone is valuable in itself, {{and that the}} value of every thing else is conditional. According to this, happiness should coincide with the consciousness of virtue, though its reference to the relations of human life requires the additional condition, that {{it is only in the}} enjoyment of the good things and circumstances originally designed for it by nature that it attains to completion; to these good things, however, sensuous gratification does not belong. In this sense he on the one hand denoted (perfect) happiness as the possession of personal virtue, and the capabilities adapted to it, and therefore reckoned among its constituent elements, besides moral actions conditions and facilities, those movements and relations also without which external good things cannot be attained, and on the other hand did not allow that wisdom, understood as the science of first causes or intelligible essence, or as theoretical understanding, is by itself the true wisdom which should be striven after by people, and therefore seems to have regarded this human wisdom as at the same time exerted in investigating, defining, and applying. How decidedly he insisted not only on the recognition of the unconditional nature of moral excellence, but on morality of thought, is shown by his declaration, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> to the same thing whether one casts longing eyes, or sets one's feet upon the property of others. His moral earnestness is also expressed in the warning that the ears of children should be guarded against the poison of immoral speeches.|$|E
