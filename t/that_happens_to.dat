25|$|The {{penitent}} is {{the subject}} rather than the object of this discourse. Contrition is not something <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> the penitent but is rather an affect he or she creates, as the focus on humility and on the weeping voice suggests. Affectivity is the translation of idea into expressive gesture, and this moment is surely an affective one. If the genuineness of a late-medieval spiritual experience is confirmed by its external signs—by its affectivity, in other words—we should extend the same criterion to the early evidence, where we find that it works just as well.|$|E

25|$|This {{novel is}} notable for its overt use of coincidence, such as Mrs Oliver {{going into a}} café <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> contain the girl she is seeking, and having a key piece of {{evidence}} literally fall into her hands from a drawer as furniture is being removed from a dead woman's flat. This very obvious use of coincidence is known as open authorial manipulation and {{is often used to}} draw the reader's attention to the artificiality of the plot. It is highly appropriate to a detective novel in which a central character writes detective fiction and is an example of metafiction.|$|E
25|$|When kept as a talisman, a {{horseshoe}} is said {{to bring}} good luck. Some believe that to hang it with the ends pointing upwards is good luck as it acts as a storage container of sorts for any good luck <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> be floating by, whereas to hang it with the ends pointing down, is bad luck as all the good luck will fall out. Others believe that the horseshoe should be hung the other way (with the ends pointing down), as it will then release its luck to the people around it. A stylized variation of the horseshoe is used for a popular throwing game, horseshoes.|$|E
25|$|The much fainter {{red dwarf}} Proxima Centauri, or simply Proxima, is about 13,000 astronomical units (AU) away from Alpha Centauri AB.

Due to the large distance between Proxima and Alpha, it was long unknown whether they were gravitationally bound. The true orbital speed is necessarily small, and {{it was necessary to}} measure the speeds of Proxima and Alpha with a great precision. Otherwise it was impossible to ascertain whether Proxima is bound to Alpha or whether it is a completely unrelated star <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> be undergoing a close approach at a low relative speed. Probability suggested that such low speed approaches would be rare and unlikely, but it could not be ruled out.|$|E

25|$|Informally put, the axiom {{of choice}} says that given any {{collection}} of bins, each containing at least one object, {{it is possible to}} make a selection of exactly one object from each bin. In many cases such a selection can be made without invoking the {{axiom of choice}}; this is in particular the case if the number of bins is finite, or if a selection rule is available: a distinguishing property <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> hold for exactly one object in each bin. To give an informal example, for any (even infinite) collection of pairs of shoes, one can pick out the left shoe from each pair to obtain an appropriate selection, but for an infinite collection of pairs of socks (assumed to have no distinguishing features), such a selection can be obtained only by invoking the axiom of choice.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{a variant}} has emerged, {{producing}} what {{is sometimes called}} the steam bagel. To make a steam bagel, the boiling is skipped, and the bagels are instead baked in an oven equipped with a steam injection system. In commercial bagel production, the steam bagel process requires less labor, since bagels need only be directly handled once, at the shaping stage. Thereafter, the bagels need never be removed from their pans as they are refrigerated and then steam-baked. The steam bagel is {{not considered to be}} a genuine bagel by purists, as it results in a fluffier, softer, less chewy product more akin to a finger roll <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> be shaped like a bagel. Steam bagels are considered lower quality by purists as the dough used is intentionally more alkaline. The increase in pH is to aid browning, since the steam injection process uses neutral water steam instead of an alkaline solution bath.|$|E
25|$|Ballads {{dating back}} to the 15th century are the oldest {{existing}} form of the Robin Hood legends, although none of them were recorded {{at the time of the}} first allusions to him, and many are from much later. They share many common features, often opening with praise of the greenwood and relying heavily on disguise as a plot device, but include a wide variation in tone and plot. The ballads are sorted into three groups, very roughly according to date of first known free-standing copy. Ballads whose first recorded version appears (usually incomplete) in the Percy Folio may appear in later versions and may be much older than the mid-17th century when the Folio was compiled. Any ballad may be older than the oldest copy <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> survive, or descended from a lost older ballad. For example, the plot of Robin Hood's Death, found in the Percy Folio, is summarised in the 15th-century A Gest of Robyn Hode, and it also appears in an 18th-century version.|$|E

25|$|The ordinary, familiar, {{everyday}} {{things and}} occurrences we have, constitute occasions {{for the experience}} of God. Such things as one's daily sustenance, the very day itself, are felt as manifestations of God's loving-kindness, calling for the Berakhot. Kedushah, holiness, which is nothing else than the imitation of God, is concerned with daily conduct, with being gracious and merciful, with keeping oneself from defilement by idolatry, adultery, and the shedding of blood. The Birkat Ha-Mitzwot evokes the consciousness of holiness at a rabbinic rite, but the objects employed {{in the majority of}} these rites are non-holy and of general character, while the several holy objects are non-theurgic. And not only do ordinary things and occurrences bring with them the experience of God. Everything <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> a man evokes that experience, evil as well as good, for a Berakah is said also at evil tidings. Hence, although the experience of God is like none other, the occasions for experiencing Him, for having a consciousness of Him, are manifold, even if we consider only those that call for Berakot.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{phenomenon}} of statistical learning was first discovered {{in the context of}} language acquisition and there is much evidence of its role in that purpose, work since the original discovery has suggested that statistical learning may be a domain general skill and is likely not unique to humans. For example, Saffran, Johnson, Aslin, and Newport found that both adults and infants were able to learn statistical probabilities of “words” created by playing different musical tones (i.e., participants heard the musical notes D, E, and F presented together during training and were able to recognize those notes as a unit at test as compared to three notes that had not been presented together). In non-auditory domains, there is evidence that humans are able to learn statistical visual information whether that information is presented across space, e.g., or time, e.g.,. Evidence of statistical learning has also been found in other primates, e.g., and some limited statistical learning abilities have been found even in non-primates like rats. Together these findings suggest that statistical learning may be a generalized learning mechanism <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> be utilized in language acquisition, rather than a mechanism that is unique to the human infant’s ability to learn his or her language(s).|$|E
