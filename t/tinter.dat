Though many reformers {{had left}} the congregation, several reforms in the service were {{nonetheless}} introduced: the congregation abolished most piyyutim and the Priestly Blessing, and, in 1873, introduced a confirmation ceremony for girls, led by the Reverend Dr. <b>Tinter.</b> The confirmation ceremonies, which had initially been held during the holiday of Sukkot, were eventually moved to the holiday of Shavuot (the holiday during which the Reform movement held these ceremonies), and continued for {{both boys and girls}} (in place of Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations) until the 1940s.|$|E

In 1878 <b>Tinter</b> was dismissed for officiating at the marriage of a Jewish woman and Christian man, and Baith Israel was, for a time, the only congregation in Brooklyn that celebrated Jewish holidays for the traditional two days. In 1889 Baith Israel asserted it was [...] "the only orthodox congregation in the city", and that year the board forced the resignation of a Mr. J. Folkart, for transgressing the laws of Yom Kippur. In 1892, when Hyman Rosenberg was expelled as rabbi of Brooklyn's Beth Jacob synagogue for eating ham, the Brooklyn Eagle canvassed local rabbis for their views on the matter. While George Taubenhaus, rabbi of Beth Elohim stated, [...] "I do not believe my congregation would expel me if I ate ham", Baith Israel's rabbi Friedlander responded, [...] "While there are some differences between the reform and orthodox Jews, I do not think it is the place for any Jewish minister to eat ham. The reformers do not so strictly observe the old Mosaic law, but {{it does not seem to}} me a good example for a rabbi to set to his congregation." ...|$|E

After further investigation, he named it as a new species in a new genus, Pseudotheraphosa. In 2001, based on a phylogenetic analysis, Rogério Bertani rejected this genus and placed the species in Theraphosa, a view followed since by other workers.|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} examination {{of data from}} many countries shows that in 1967 - 92, eighty-one percent of the world's population lived in countries where agricultural growth exceeded population growth. Moreover, that growth occurred as agricultural prices declined. Productivity gains are a dominant characteristic of agriculture for the period. Average productivity increased for land and labor. Moreover, agricultural productivity gains were greater than average productivity gains for the economy in 80 percent of the countries studied. Measuring the effects of technology choice on productivity is crucial to understanding the determinants of agricultural growth. After selectively reviewing applied production studies, the authors conclude that the choice-of-technique method, which {{has its roots in}} <b>Tinter's</b> early production function studies, is best suited for examining the determinants of agricultural growth. Investments in technology have yielded large gains for agriculture, and the benefits have been passed on to customers in the form of lower prices. Thus history justifies public spending on agricultural research.

40|$|Linear {{programming}} {{was first}} developed by George B. Dantzig, Marshall Wood, and associates of the U. S. Air Force, in 1947. At that time, the Air Force organized a research group {{under the title}} of project SCOOP (Scientific Computation of Optimum Programs). This project contributed to the developing of a general interindustry model based on the Leontief input-output model, the Air Force programming and budgeting problem, and the problems which involved the relationship between two-person zero sum games and linear programming. The result was the formal development and application of the linear programming model. This project also developed the simplex computational method for finding the optimum feasible program. Early applications of linear programming {{were made in the}} military, in economics, and in the theory of games. During the last decade, however, linear programming applications have been extended to such other fields as management, engineering, and agriculture. As the application of linear programming has extended to many other fields, Dantzig (1955), <b>Tinter</b> (1955), Beale (1955), Madansky (1960), and others have been responsible for the formulation and development of stochastic linear programming. The stochastic linear programming problem occurs when some of the coefficients, in the objective function and/or in the constraint system of the linear programming model, are subject to random variation. In the literature, several methods are indicated for formulating the linear programming problem with random requirements to arrive at a solution. The intention {{of this study is to}} review some of these methods, and to compare one wit another in terms of the optimum value of the objective function which results from each method. There are three methods that will be considered. The first method is to replace the random element with its expected value and solve the resulting linear programming problem (Hadley, 1964). The second method is Dantzig’s two-stage linear programming problem with a random requirement (Dantzig, 1955). Suppose the following linear programming problem is considered: Min. (or max.) C’X X ≥ 0 Subject to: AX ≤ b, Where C and X are n by 1 vectors, b an m by 1 vector, and A an n matrix, and C’ is C transpose. If vector b is random and matrix A is known, then in the first stage, a decision is made on X, the random vector b is observed, and AX is compared with b. In the second stage, inaccuracies in the first decision are compensated for by a new decision variable Y with some penalty cost F. The problem then becomes, E min. (or max.) C’X + F’Y, X ≥ 0, Y ≥ 0, Subject to : AX + BY = b, Where B is an m by 2 n matrix with elements ones, minus ones, and zeroes, and Y is an 2 n by 1 vector with elements yi and y-i. E denotes an expectation. In the third method, the constraints with random requirements are to satisfy a given probability level. The problem then is to find values of the decision variables which optimize the expected objective function without violating the given probability measure (Charnes and Cooper, 1962). This report surveys the literature on basic linear programming and the simplex method of solution, describes random requirements, and illustrates three methods of solution. Finally, the optimal value of the objective function of each method is compared with the others...|$|E
