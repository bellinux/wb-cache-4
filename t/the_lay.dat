5|$|The west range at Netley {{is small}} and does not run {{the full length of}} {{the west side of the}} cloister. It is divided in two by the {{original}} main entrance to the abbey, with an outer parlour where the monks could meet visitors. North of this on the ground floor were cellars for food storage, and to the south was <b>the</b> <b>lay</b> brothers' refectory. The upper floor, reached by a stair from the cloister, was the dormitory for <b>the</b> <b>lay</b> brothers. Netley was a late foundation, built at a time when <b>the</b> <b>lay</b> brothers were a declining part of the Cistercian economy, and it is probable that they were fewer in number, hence the small size of the accommodation needed. By the time the west range was completed in the fourteenth century they were rapidly disappearing, and had all but vanished by the end of the century. During the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries most Cistercian houses took advantage of the large area of the monastery then left empty and converted <b>the</b> <b>lay</b> brothers' quarters to new uses. At some houses, such as Sawley Abbey, a series of comfortable chambers for the use of monastic officials or guests were built; elsewhere, such as Hailes Abbey, the west range was turned into a private dwelling of great elegance for the abbot. The ruins of the west range at Netley are too fragmentary to be sure of their purpose in the latter part of the medieval period.|$|E

40|$|In laying hens, {{behavioral}} responses measured late in <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> period {{are associated}} with decreased performance. If measured early in <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> period, these behavioral responses {{could be used to}} predict performance later in life. The main objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the association of the behavioral response toward a novel object at 23 wk of age with subsequent performance during <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> period. A total of 1, 251 hens from 6 different pure-bred Rhode Island Red lines (208 hens per line on average) were housed in 318 cages (56 cages per line on average). Performance variables included egg production (both per hen-present and hen-housed); BW at 19, 51, and 69 wk of age; mortality; and feather damage at 63 wk. Hens from cages with an approach response realized greater total egg production (hen-day and hen-housed) and greater egg production in the middle (hen-housed) and end of <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> period (per hen present and hen housed) compared with hens from cages with a passive response toward the novel object. Approach responses were also associated with more feather damage, but not with BW or mortality. Low correlations were found between greater egg production and more feather damage. These results suggest that an approach response toward a novel object measured early in <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> period is associated with better performance later in <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> period. <b>The</b> novel object test early in <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> period can be used to predict subsequent performance, although possible causal mechanisms for this association remain to be investigated...|$|R

5|$|After the Union of Lublin, the Senate {{of general}} sejm of the Commonwealth became {{augmented}} by Lithuanian high officials; {{the position of}} <b>the</b> <b>lay</b> and ecclesiastical lords, who served for life {{as members of the}} Senate was strengthened, as the already outnumbered middle szlachta high office holders had now proportionally fewer representatives in the upper chamber. The Senate could also be convened separately by the king in its traditional capacity of the royal council, apart from any sejm's formal deliberations, and szlachta's attempts to limit the upper chamber's role had not been successful. After the formal union and the addition of deputies from the Grand Duchy, and Royal Prussia, also more fully integrated with the Crown in 1569, there were about 170 regional deputies in the lower chamber (referred to as the Sejm) and 140 senators.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time there was a change in castle architecture. Until the late 12thcentury castles {{generally}} had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrowslits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have been dictated by <b>the</b> <b>lay</b> of the land (the result was often irregular or curvilinear structures). The design of castles was not uniform, but these were features that could be found in a typical castle in the mid-12thcentury. By the end of the 12thcentury or the early 13thcentury, a newly constructed castle could be expected to be polygonal in shape, with towers at the corners to provide enfilading fire for the walls. The towers would have protruded from the walls and featured arrowslits on each level to allow archers to target anyone nearing or at the curtain wall.|$|E

5|$|Between 1142 and 1170 the Knights Hospitaller {{undertook}} a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was between two towers {{on the eastern}} side, {{and there was a}} postern gate in the northwest tower. At the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers. <b>The</b> <b>lay</b> of the land dictated the castle's irregular shape. A site with natural defences was a typical location for Crusader castles and steep slopes provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one, where the castle's defences were concentrated. This phase of building was incorporated into the later castle's construction.|$|E
5|$|But reform {{brought with}} it new ways of {{thinking}} about the church and its personnel, derived not only from contemporary continental movements but also from the rich pastoral and canonical literature of the Carolingian renaissance. This disseminated ideas concerning the separation of <b>the</b> <b>lay</b> and religious spheres, the distinction between monks and clergy, and enhanced the authority of bishops as both pastoral and political leaders. Ultimately, these ideas were to strike at deeply entrenched features of the early medieval church, such as hereditary control of churches and the right of the clergy to marry.|$|E
5|$|In 1814, Egan (now {{bishop of}} Philadelphia) {{promoted}} de Barth {{to the position}} of Vicar General. Egan died shortly thereafter. Until a suitable bishop could be found, Carroll, now Archbishop of Baltimore, appointed de Barth as the apostolic administrator. De Barth tried to refuse this assignment, likely due to the ongoing disputes in Philadelphia between the clergy and <b>the</b> <b>lay</b> trustees of the city's parishes over who should control the churches, but he eventually accepted and took temporary control of the diocese. He spent little time in the city, leaving day-to-day control of the parishes there to Terrence McGill, a local priest.|$|E

5|$|In {{supporting}} Calvin's {{proposals for}} reforms, {{the council of}} Geneva passed the Ordonnances ecclésiastiques (Ecclesiastical Ordinances) on 20 November 1541. The ordinances defined four orders of ministerial function: pastors to preach and to administer the sacraments; doctors to instruct believers in the faith; elders to provide discipline; and deacons {{to care for the}} poor and needy. They also called for the creation of the Consistoire (Consistory), an ecclesiastical court composed of <b>the</b> <b>lay</b> elders and the ministers. The city government retained the power to summon persons before the court, and the Consistory could judge only ecclesiastical matters having no civil jurisdiction. Originally, the court had the power to mete out sentences, with excommunication as its most severe penalty. The government contested this power and on 19 March 1543 the council decided that all sentencing would be carried out by the government.|$|E
