A new {{transient}} directional {{unit for}} extra high voltage(EHV) power transmission lines is proposed, which identifies fault direction {{by means of}} comparing the time-domain transient energy of the forward traveling-wave {{with that of the}} backward one in the {{very short period of time}} after fault occurs. The unit algorithm is designed with the technology of adaptive median filtering, which is first employed to process the forward and backward traveling-waves, and then calculates the time-domain transient energy ratio of the forward traveling-wave to the back one, by which the fault direction is discriminated. Numerous ATP-EMTP simulation tests show that this proposed directional unit not only operates reliably, sensitively and ultra-high-speed, but also endure the influences of various factors, including different fault types, fault locations, <b>transition</b> <b>resistances</b> or fault inception angles.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{consider}} the method of constructive parameters calculation of the elastic elements, which are used in electrical connectors of flexible printed cables. Electrical connectors characterized {{by the fact that}} the contact pair is needed to provide pressure. It is also important to know the optimum ratio between stability of the contact connection and the necessary value of the <b>transition</b> <b>resistance.</b> These ratios are studied sufficiently for discrete electrical connectors, however for connectors of flexible printed cables this theme is not explored enough. The purpose of this work is to develop methods that will allow to carry out calculations for elastic elements, which provide communication, and to determine the size of case elements for electrical connectors. We consider two types of connectors. First are removable electrical connections where it is necessary to find a compromise between the resistance value and the separating (engaging) force. Second are permanent connections, where counts only the value of the <b>transition</b> <b>resistance.</b> For the first type of connectors were considered a simple form of the liner, in the shape of a rubber block, as in this case, the pressure should be created only by the compression of the liner and fixing it. It is important to get accurate results of the pressure calculation for removable electrical connections, because in this case we consider especial shape of elastomeric liner, which allows to create the pressure not only by compression of the liner, but by deformation it as a spring. For this task, the engaging force was specified on the basis of already known facts. It was important to set the amount of deformation that defines the shape and size of the liner and the case. We solved the problem of transition from the units of measuring hardness, specified in the technical specifications of rubber, to the value of the Young's modulus used in the calculations of constructive parameters of connectors. We got an analytic dependence that can be used to find the Young's modulus for a known value of hardness on a scale Shore A.

40|$|The {{methods of}} {{determining}} the kind of phase-to-phase short circuit (SC) on the lines of 6 – 35 kV for improvement the technical perfection of their current protections are surveyed. Preference {{is given to the}} method of determining damages according to the relative unbalance the operating currents. The possibility of using the phase currents or their differences for this purpose is demonstrated. The method of computational experiment was used to investigate the influence of the DC load line and <b>transition</b> <b>resistance</b> at the failure site on the relative asymmetry of the currents that ultimately determines the reliability of the establishment of the kind of SC. It is discovered that when the phase currents are used to determine the type of the failure higher sensitivity to remote two-phase SC is achieved. However, in this case, the accuracy {{of determining the}} type of failure is more affected by currents of the line load. Determination of failure with the use of differences of phase currents is less sensitive to remote two-phase SC. However, this provides less impact on the accuracy of determining the type of failure of load line currents. <b>Transition</b> <b>resistance</b> at the failure site shifts the relative unbalance of the currents to the area of twophase SC. It is established that despite the kind of a remote SC in parallel lines the proposed methods provide accurate determination of types of failure that simultaneously occurs on the monitored line. When failures are superpositioned, one of which is on one of the parallel lines near the common bus and the other second on the monitored bus, the kind of the SC, determined by any of the proposed methods may differ from the actual one. It depends on the types of resulting failures, the combinations of shutting phases, the steady-state current distribution in the network and other factors. The proposed methods make it possible to determine the kind of phase-to-phase SC, in the worst case, for a time not exceeding the period of industrial frequency. </p...|$|E
