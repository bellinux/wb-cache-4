5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{depends on}} the underlying cause and whether any complications occur. Rhabdomyolysis complicated by acute kidney impairment in patients with traumatic injury may have a mortality rate of 20%. Admission to <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit</b> {{is associated with a}} mortality of 22% in the absence of acute kidney injury, and 59% if kidney impairment occurs. Most people who have sustained kidney impairment due to rhabdomyolysis fully recover their kidney function.|$|E
5|$|Intravenous {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated in critical care units. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine in <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit</b> (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E

This kind of information we got by anonymous questionnaires, set up from 23 questions with open and closed form. In theoretical part I deal with actual status, explaining term of mobbing, bossing, causes of bullying, characteristic of the participants, bullying in the health service in the Czech republic. In the conclusion I show prevention and tolerance of mobbing and bossing. In practical part I point on assesment of hypothesis and evaluation of the target of my thesis.

5|$|If {{a seizure}} lasts longer than 5minutes {{or if there}} are more than two {{seizures}} in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit</b> and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{head trauma}} {{is thought to}} be influenced in part by the location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding. It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects of traumatic brain injury; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis or whether it is merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred. People with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the risk of dying as those who do not. They also have a higher risk of severe disability and persistent vegetative state, and traumatic SAH has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and longer stays in <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit.</b> However, more than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome.|$|E

Later in the month, he notched his first shutout with the Canucks, stopping 32 shots in a 5–0 {{win over the}} Chicago Blackhawks on October 25. On January 9, 2007, Luongo was voted in as a starting goaltender {{for the first time}} in his career for the Western Conference All-Stars. Six days after the announcement, he was hospitalized after taking a puck to the throat in practice. He spent the night in <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit</b> for fears his windpipe would swell shut. Discharged from the hospital on game day, Luongo {{recorded a}} shutout that night against the Montreal Canadiens on January 16, 2007. During the 2007 NHL All-Star Game in Dallas, Luongo was named the Skills Competition's top goaltender and helped the West to a 12–9 win over the East. Late in the season, Luongo recorded his franchise record-setting 39th win in a 2–1 overtime victory on March 9. He surpassed Kirk McLean's 38-win mark set in 1991–92. He went on to finish with a career-high 47 wins, one shy of league-leader Martin Brodeur, who broke Bernie Parent's thirty-three-year-old NHL record of wins in a season. Luongo and Brodeur are considered, however, to have been given an advantage to Parent with the inauguration of the shootout that season by the NHL, allowing more games to be decided with wins, as opposed to ties.|$|E

40|$|Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is {{associated}} with nosocomial infections worldwide. Here, we used phage as a potential agent to evaluate the efficacy of daily cleaning practices combined with a bacteriophage-containing aerosol against CRAB. A two-phase prospective intervention study was performed at a 945 -bed public teaching hospital. From March to December 2013, we performed terminal cleaning using standard procedures plus an aerosol with active bacteriophage in <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> to evaluate <b>the</b> impact on nosocomial incidence density, carbapenem-resistance rates and antimicrobial drug consumption amounts. Patients with culture proven CRAB infection were transferred to the isolation room when the phage aerosol cleaning had been completed. A total of 264 new acquisitions of CRAB were identified in <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> (191 in <b>the</b> pre-intervention period and 73 in the intervention period).
