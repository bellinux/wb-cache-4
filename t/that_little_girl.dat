500|$|Matt Brassil of Heave Media ranked [...] "Boyz 4 Now" [...] as the seventh-best {{television}} {{episode of}} 2013, {{stating that the}} episode's handling of Louise's crush [...] "cracks through <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> surface into the inevitable woman [...] will become, and the writing starts to show how even the most maniacal girl with a bunny hat can be humanized." [...] Phillip Maciak, writing for the Los Angeles Review of Books, named Kristen Schaal's voice acting as Louise on Bob's Burgers as his favorite television performance {{of the year and}} cited her performance in the episode: [...] "Schaal's handling of the anger and betrayal Louise feels as she finds herself attracting to a boy for the first time is actually quite moving. But, more than that, it opens up a new register of this top-register performance as Louise’s murderous rage turns to murderous romance." ...|$|E
500|$|During filming, David Duchovny {{decided to}} act out the reunion scene in a manner {{contrary}} to what the script called for. Manners later noted, [...] "In the script, it called for his sister to run up and hug him, and Mulder was to start crying. David didn't want to cry. I said, 'David, you're finally realizing your sister is, in fact, dead. [...] He said, 'Just watch what I do; trust me.' And, he held <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> actress—there was a beatific {{smile on his face}} that was absolutely astounding." [...] Manners was very happy with the change and included it in the final cut of the episode. To create the scene featuring the ghosts of the dead children interacting with the characters, various layers of film had to be overlaid onto each other. Many passes of the shot were taken, which took hours to complete. After the shots had been secured, the film of the ghosts had to be made transparent. The scenes wherein Mulder is interacting with the walk-ins was actually shot in daylight. However, specialized [...] "day for night" [...] photography was used to make the finished scene look {{as if it had been}} filmed at night. To achieve this, the subjects were illuminated with bright lights and the sky was completely avoided. The entire scene was shot at 48 frames a second, twice that of normal speed. Rebecca Toolan was flown down from Vancouver specifically for this episode, and [...] "Sein Und Zeit". To create her ghostly apparition, the production staff had to shoot multiple frames, which were then spliced into footage of Duchovny. Manners played the part of the hypnotist in the video which Scully watches of Mulder under hypnosis. Manners later noted that [...] "I only act when you can't actually see my face". Manners was critical of Duchovny's wig—which had been added to make the footage seem older. He sardonically noted that [...] "this is [...] one of the episodes that Cheri Medcalf [...] won an Emmy for." ...|$|E

2500|$|The jury {{took just}} 16 minutes to convict Nodder of Tinsley's abduction. In his summary to the court, Justice Swift paid {{reference}} to Nodder's {{refusal to testify}} at this trial, stating: [...] "Nobody knows what has become of <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl...</b> Whatever happened to her, how she fared, who looked after her, where she slept. There is one person in this court who knows, and he is silent... he is silent! He says nothing to you at all... He sits there and never tells you a word. In passing sentence, Justice Swift added: [...] "What you did with <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> what became of her, only you know. It may be that time will reveal the dreadful secret you carry in your breast. I cannot tell, but, I am determined that, as far as have part or lot in that dreadful tragedy, I will keep you in custody." [...] He was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, to be served at Lincoln Prison.|$|E

The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) recognized these two victories as the 2005 Female Performances of the Year.

2500|$|In 2003, Iranian {{expatriate}} Azar Nafisi {{published the}} memoir Reading Lolita in Tehran about a covert women's reading group. In an NPR interview Nafisi contrasts the sorrowful and seductive sides of Dolores/Lolita's character. She notes [...] "Because {{her name is}} not Lolita, her real name is Dolores which as you know in Latin means dolour, so her real name is associated with sorrow and with anguish and with innocence, while Lolita becomes a sort of light-headed, seductive, and airy name. The Lolita of our novel is both of these {{at the same time}} and in our culture here today we only associate it with one aspect of <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> and the crassest interpretation of her." [...] Following Nafisi's comments, the NPR interviewer, Madeleine Brand, lists as embodiments of the latter side of Lolita, [...] "the Long Island Lolita, Britney Spears, the Olsen twins, and Sue Lyon in Stanley Kubrick's Lolita".|$|E
