50|$|Pollard's espionage nearly came {{to light}} in 1984 when a {{department}} head noted a report on Soviet military equipment and questioned why it was germane to the office. Pollard, whom the report was traced to, was asked about it, and he replied {{that he had been}} working on terrorist networks, which was accepted as valid. In 1985, a co-worker anonymously reported Pollard's removal of classified material from the NIC. The coworker noted that Pollard {{did not seem to be}} taking the material to any known appropriate destination, such as other intelligence agencies in the area. Although Pollard was authorized to <b>transport</b> <b>documents</b> and the coworker said the documents were properly wrapped, it appeared out of place that Pollard would be transporting documents on a Friday afternoon when there was little going on and people seemed to be focused on an upcoming long weekend. Ultimately, that report was not acted upon as it was felt it occurred within business hours and Pollard had business being in other offices.In another instance Pollard's direct superior, having to complete extra work at the office on a Saturday, had walked by Pollard's desk and noticed unsecured classified material. Taking the initiative to secure it, the supervisor glanced over it and saw it was unrelated to antiterrorism matters in the Caribbean, which is what the section focused on. Looking at more unrelated documents, the supervisor believed foreign intelligence might be involved, but was unable to determine which nation might be interested.|$|E
5000|$|An ear tag usually {{carries an}} Animal Identification Number (AIN) or code for the animal, or for its herd or flock. Non {{electronic}} ear tags may be simply handwritten {{for the convenience}} of the farmer (these are known as [...] "management tags"). Alternatively this identification number (ID) may be assigned by an organisation, such as the Meat and Livestock Association (MLA), which is a not-for-profit organisation owned by cattle, sheep and goat producers; funded by a levy on livestock sales with Federal Government input. Electronic tags may also show other information about the animal, including other related identification numbers; such as the Property Identiﬁcation Code (PIC) for the properties the animals have been located. In the case of MLA's NLIS the movement of certain species of livestock (primarily cattle, goats and sheep) must be recorded in the online database within 24 hours of the movement; and include the PICs of the properties the animals are travelling between. The National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) of Australia regulations require that all cattle be fitted with a RFID device {{in the form of an}} ear tag or rumen bolus (a cylindrical object placed in the rumen) before movement from the property and that the movement be reported to the NLIS. However, if animals are tagged for internal purposes in a herd or farm, IDs need not be unique in larger scales. The NLIS now also requires sheep and goats to use an ear tag that has the Property Identiﬁcation Code inscribed on it. These ear tags and boluses are complemented by <b>transport</b> <b>documents</b> supplied by vendors that are used for identification and tracking. A similar system is used for cattle in the European Union (EU), each bovine animal having a passport document and tag in each ear carrying the same number (see British Cattle Movement Service). Sheep and goats in the EU have a tag in one or both ears carrying the official number of their flock and also for breeding stock an individual number for each animal; one of these tags (usually the left) must have a RFID chip (or the chip may instead be carried in a rumen bolus or on an anklet).|$|E

40|$|<b>Transport</b> <b>documents</b> play {{a crucial}} role in {{international}} trade of goods. Their role is particularly evident in the area of massive, rapid and reliable supply of goods worldwide. Among many diversity and heterogeneous issues related to the <b>transport</b> <b>documents,</b> the question of transfer of rights incorporate into a bill of lading has a particular meaning. In this paper we’ll try to make analysis of some legal and economic aspects of <b>transport</b> <b>documents.</b> Through analysis of this issue, we will try to point out their function in international trade, their perception from the banking sector, and ultimately, their contribution to the rapid and stable international trade of goods. The complexity of the issue stems from the existence of multiple legal relations and the participation of multiple stakeholders in the transport and sale agreement. Although the law explicitly governs this issue, the practice raises more contentious situations that generate numerous arbitration and litigation cases. In this sense, the question is: which of the transport document has the status of proprietary document, which of them has the status of security, and finally, which of the issued documents are legal basis for the implementation of the letter of credit, prior to the banking sector!? On the other hand, the question of the reliability of these legal documents, justification and validity of electronic waybill is raised. Attitude towards the practice of <b>transport</b> <b>documents,</b> and resolving the issue of the responsibility of the parties, for the most part are based on the type of bill of lading issued by the carrier. Numerous judicial and arbitral decisions that determine the liability of the carrier, forwarder and logistics provider are based on the status of the <b>transport</b> <b>documents</b> issued by them. Theoretical analysis and positive law are only solutions on paper. In reality, business practice and autonomous commercial law are key instrument for executions of sale contracts. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{legal nature}} {{of the bill of}} lading as a {{negotiable}} document of title has allowed it to provide the basis of a system in which bankers provide credit for the financing of international sales contracts on the strength of the security afforded by the goods represented in the bill.

Multimodal <b>transport</b> <b>documents</b> which may be issued in negotiable or non-negotiable form assume the same legal role as the bill oflading or sea waybill respectively.

50|$|A freight {{forwarder}} offering a consolidation service, will issue its own air waybill or bill of lading. From now on AWB {{will be used}} to refer to both. This is called a Forwarder's or House AWB with its equivalent House BL. These act as contracts of carriage between the shipper and the forwarder, who in this case becomes a Deemed Carrier. The forwarder in turn enters into contracts with one or more carriers, often using more than one mode of transportation. The contract of carriage between the forwarder and carrier is called a Master Air Waybill (MAWB or MBL). A House Air Waybill (HAWB) or Bill of Lading (HBL) could act as a multimodal <b>transport</b> <b>document.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide a comparison between EU and National (Member States) freight transport policies. Emphasis is given to policies aiming to increase co-modality and promote the sustainability of the European Freight Transport System. The results suggest that the intended Member States’ policies to a great extent are aligned with the corresponding EU policies although the degree of alignment varies among Member States and freight transport policy areas. Infrastructure investments and differences among countries in relation to transport taxes, vehicle weights, and dimensions were identified as major barriers for the development of a European Co-Modal Freight Transport System. Policies towards removing existing barriers along with standardization actions, e. g., single <b>transport</b> <b>document,</b> enhancement of the training of the freight transport and logistics personnel, and further adoption and implementation of ICT, can substantially improve the competitive position of European intermodal freight systems...|$|R
