40|$|Estimating {{the number}} of {{distinct}} values in a data stream is a vital problem with many applications such as complex join query over multiple data streams. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} continuous and periodic distinct values estimation over sliding windows. We propose a <b>compound</b> <b>sliding</b> window model to compute the distinct values over basic sliding windows in an incremental way. LDV, HDV and AHDV are the three algorithms that are based on <b>compound</b> <b>sliding</b> windows. <b>The</b> basic idea behind <b>the</b> <b>compound</b> <b>sliding</b> windows is to organize the basic windows into a Hash table according to distinct values. Whenever a new data arrives at the data stream, it is inserted into a basic window. Once the basic window is full, a scan using distinct values is executed and the distinct values number is updated incrementally. Theoretical analysis and experiment results show that the distinct values estimation algorithms based on <b>compound</b> <b>sliding</b> windows have a great performance benefits...|$|R
40|$|Geological {{surveying}} in {{soft rock}} landslide terrain with compound shaped landslides formed by slide prone horizons (SPH) cannot normally be comprehensive without subsurface investigations: the sharp angled shear surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>compound</b> <b>slides</b> result in <b>the</b> complete deformation {{of the in}} situ fabric and prevents exposure of the intact material located just above the SPH. The problem is illustrated {{with respect to the}} coastal outcrop of the Barton Clay in its type area in Christchurch Bay, Hampshire, UK. The extensive historical literature is briefly reviewed to show the difficulties experienced by the geologists seeking to give a comprehensive account of the stratigraphic sequence. Recent drilling through the most prominent SPH and a fortuitous exposure revealing details of a higher SPH has allowed details of the normally obscured part of the sequence to be revealed...|$|R

40|$|The {{tripartite}} {{efflux pump}} AcrAB-TolC {{is responsible for}} the intrinsic and acquired multidrug resistance in Escherichia coli. Its active part, the homotrimeric transporter AcrB, {{is in charge of the}} selective binding of substrates and energy transduction. The mutation F 610 A has been shown to significantly reduce the minimum inhibitory concentration of doxorubicin and many other substrates, although F 610 does not appear to interact strongly with them. Biochemical study of transport kinetics in AcrB is not yet possible, except for some β-lactams, and other techniques should supply this important information. Therefore, in this work, we assess the impact of the F 610 A mutation on the functionality of AcrB by means of computational techniques, using doxorubicin as substrate. We found that <b>the</b> <b>compound</b> <b>slides</b> deeply inside <b>the</b> binding pocket after mutation, increasing the strength of the interaction. During subsequent conformational alterations of the transporter, doxorubicin was either not extruded from the binding site or displaced along a direction other than the one associated with extrusion.

40|$|The {{tripartite}} {{efflux pump}} AcrAB-TolC {{is responsible for}} the intrinsic and acquired multidrug resistance in Escherichia coli. Its active part, the homotrimeric transporter AcrB, {{is in charge of the}} selective binding of substrates and energy transduction. The presence of several phenilalanine residues in the only binding pocket identified by X-ray has inspired an experimental work where the effects of single point Phe->Ala mutations on the MIC and on the efflux of several antibiotics have been determined [1, 2]. Concerning the MICs, interestingly, the mutation F 610 A has been shown to significantly reduce the minimum inhibitory concentration of doxorubicin and many other substrates, although F 610 does not appear to interact strongly with them or to be involved in the squeezing mechanism of the binding pocket suggested as preliminary step of the extrusion process. In this work, we assess the impact of the experimental mutations on the functionality of AcrB by means of computational techniques, using doxorubicin and minocycline as substrates. We found that for F 610 A <b>the</b> <b>compounds</b> <b>slide</b> deeply inside <b>the</b> binding pocket after mutation, increasing the strength of the interaction. During subsequent conformational alterations of the transporter, the substrates were either not extruded from the binding site or displaced along a direction other than the one associated with extrusion.

Our study indicates how subtle interactions determine the functionality of multidrug transporters, since decreased transport might not be simplistically correlated to decreased substrate binding affinity.

In Chapter 1 the problem, aims and the method were established In Chapter 2 a survey of the general bibliography on the subject was given. This study is mainly structural of nature, but preliminary remarks about the T. G. G. on the subject were also taken into account. A broad discussion an the structural view was given In terms of General Linguistics as applied to the African languages. In Chapter 3 language structure and language system was discussed in order to establish a framework wherein <b>the</b> <b>compound</b> could be studied according to the different language disciplines. In Chapter 4 the position of <b>the</b> <b>compound</b> in relation to the other language symbols were established by applying the different word tests of Van Wyk. After it was established that <b>the</b> <b>compound</b> is a word, the linguistic disciplines for example morphology, syntax, semantics and phonology, were appalled in order to describe <b>the</b> <b>compound</b> scientifically. In Chapter 5 <b>the</b> <b>compound</b> was studied morphologically. Its different morphemes were identified. This was followed by describing the syntactic structures o f <b>the</b> <b>compound.</b> It was established that the underlying structure of <b>the</b> <b>compound</b> is a word group. In this process {{it was found that the}} syntactic processes, for example reduction and substitution played a major role In the establishment of <b>the</b> <b>compound.</b> In Chapter 6 the semantics of <b>the</b> <b>compound</b> was studied. Paradigmatic and syntagmatic semantic characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>compound</b> in Northern Sotho were identified. It was established that the paradigmatic semantic characteristics of word correlates are inhibited by the syntagmatic relation in order to bring about an unambiguous interpretation. The metaphor was found t o be even more profound in compounds than in non-compounded words. In Chapter 7 the phonological aspects of <b>the</b> <b>compound</b> were discussed. It was discovered that occlusivation played a major role in the establishment of <b>the</b> <b>compound.</b> In Chapter 8 the statistics of 2472 compounds which were compiled in the appendix, were given. It was found that the noun and the verb stem were the most productive components in <b>the</b> formation of <b>compounds.</b> A summary and conclusions were given in Chapter 9. The conclusion was reached that <b>the</b> <b>compound</b> certainly has a place in the language system and that it belongs to the sub-system of the word on grounds of its morphological, syntactic, semantic and phonological characteristics.
