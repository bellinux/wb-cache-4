5|$|However, the {{aftermath}} of <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>is</b> not always easily erased, {{as many of the}} economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute. The breakdown of state control {{in a number of areas}} formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure.|$|E
5|$|Producing {{plutonium}} in useful quantities for {{the first}} time was {{a major part of the}} Manhattan Project during World War II that developed the first atomic bombs. The Fat Man bombs used in the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945, and in the bombing of Nagasaki in August 1945, had plutonium cores. Human radiation experiments studying plutonium were conducted without informed consent, and several criticality accidents, some lethal, occurred after the war. Disposal of plutonium waste from nuclear power plants and dismantled nuclear weapons built during <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>is</b> a nuclear-proliferation and environmental concern. Other sources of plutonium in the environment are fallout from numerous above-ground nuclear tests, now banned.|$|E
25|$|One interpretation, {{which was}} adopted during <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War,</b> <b>is</b> {{that either the}} PRC or the ROC is the sole {{rightful}} government of all China and that the other government is illegitimate. While much of the western bloc maintained relations with the ROC until the 1970s under this policy, much of the eastern bloc maintained relations with the PRC. While {{the government of the}} ROC considered itself the remaining holdout of the legitimate government of a country overrun by what it thought of as Communist rebels, the PRC claimed to have succeeded the ROC in the Chinese Civil War. Though the ROC no longer portrays itself as the sole legitimate government of China, the position of the PRC remained unchanged until the early 2000s, when the PRC began to soften its position on this issue to promote Chinese reunification.|$|E

500|$|Early in the Cold War era, NATO and the Warsaw Pact {{were created}} by the United States and The Soviet Union, respectively. They were also {{referred}} to as the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc. The circumstances of these two blocs were so different that they were essentially two worlds, however, they were not numbered first and second. The onset of <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>is</b> marked by Winston Churchill's famous [...] "Iron Curtain" [...] speech.

The Bill Clinton administration is often treated {{as an extension of}} the Reagan Era, as is the George W. Bush administration.

He used two dozen charts and a metal pointer during the ad, explaining that [...] "We got into trickle-down economics and it didn't trickle." [...] He later concluded that [...] "our President blames Congress, Congress blames the President, the Democrats and Republicans blame each other. Nobody {{steps up to the}} plate and accepts responsibility for anything." [...] He spent a large portion of the infomercial speaking into the camera while sitting at a desk in front of a bookshelf. Political experts commented that the nature of the ad was groundbreaking. Two days later, an ad campaign was unveiled that included three new 60-second commercials to air on ESPN, CNN and five other cable networks. One commercial entitled [...] "Red Flag" [...] displayed a waving red flag with a background drum roll and the statement: [...] "While <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>is</b> ending another war is upon us. In this new war, the enemy is not the red flag of Communism, but the red ink of our national debt, the red tape of our government bureaucracy.

500|$|General Secretary Gorbachev said of {{his former}} rival's Cold War role: [...] " [...] {{a man who was}} {{instrumental}} in bringing {{about the end of the}} Cold War," [...] and deemed him [...] "a great president." [...] Gorbachev does not acknowledge a win or loss in the war, but rather a peaceful end; he said he was not intimidated by Reagan's harsh rhetoric. Margaret Thatcher, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, said of Reagan, [...] "he warned that the Soviet Union had an insatiable drive for military power... but he also sensed it was being eaten away by systemic failures impossible to reform." [...] She later said, [...] "Ronald Reagan had a higher claim than any other leader to have won the Cold War for liberty and he did it without a shot being fired." [...] Said Brian Mulroney, former Prime Minister of Canada: [...] "He enters history as a strong and dramatic player [...]" [...] Former President Lech Wałęsa of Poland acknowledged, [...] "Reagan was one of the world leaders who made a major contribution to communism's collapse." [...] That Reagan had little or no effect in ending <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>is</b> argued with equal weight; that Communism's internal weakness had become apparent, and the Soviet Union would have collapsed in the end regardless of who was in power. President Harry S. Truman's policy of containment is also regarded as a force behind the fall of the USSR, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan undermined the Soviet system itself.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to political turmoil in Ukraine in early 2014, Paul initially {{said that the}} United States should remain mindful {{of the fact that}} although <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>is</b> over, Russia remains a military power with long-range nuclear missiles. He said that the United States should try to maintain a [...] "respectful relationship with Russia" [...] and avoid taking actions that the Russians might view as a provocation, such as seeking to have Ukraine join NATO or otherwise interfering in Russia's relationship with Ukraine. Two weeks later, after the Russian parliament authorized {{the use of military force}} in Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered military exercises along Russia's border with Ukraine, Paul began taking a different tone. He wrote: [...] "Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is a gross violation of that nation's sovereignty and an affront to the international community... Putin must be punished for violating the Budapest Memorandum, and Russia must learn that the U.S. will isolate it if it insists on acting like a rogue nation." [...] He said that the United States and European allies could retaliate against Russia's military aggression without any need for military action. He urged that the United States impose economic sanctions on Russia and resume an effort to build ]. He also called for the United States to take steps as a counterweight to Russia's strategic influence on Europe's oil and gas supply, such as lifting restrictions on new exploration and drilling for fossil fuels in the United States along with immediate approval of the controversial Keystone Pipeline, which he said would allow the United States to ship more oil and gas to Europe if Russia attempts to cut off its own supply to Europe.|$|E

2500|$|The effect The Beatles had in Russia during <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>is</b> {{an example}} of how music artists and their songs can become political.

2500|$|Soon {{after the}} end of the Second World War, the Cold War (1946–1991) began. The formal onset of <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War,</b> <b>is</b> usually {{credited}} to the 1945 defection of a Soviet cipher clerk working in Ottawa, Igor Gouzenko. This was the first event that led to [...] "PROFUNC", a Government of Canada top secret plan to identify and detain communist sympathizers during the height of the Cold War. As a founding member of NATO and a signatory to the NORAD treaty with the US, Canada committed itself to the alliance against the Communist bloc. Canadian troops were stationed in Germany throughout the Cold War, and Canada joined with the Americans to erect defences against Soviet attack, such as the DEW Line. As a middle power, Canadian policy makers realized that Canada could do little militarily on its own, and thus a policy of multilateralism was adopted whereby Canada's international military efforts would be a part of a larger coalition. This led to Canada choosing to stay out of several wars despite the participation of close allies, most notably the Vietnam War and the Second Iraq War, although Canada lent indirect support and Canadian citizens served in foreign armies in both conflicts.|$|E
