500|$|Rise Against's musical style {{throughout}} the band's {{career has been}} described by most critics as melodic hardcore, punk rock, and hardcore punk. The band has cited numerous punk and hardcore bands as influences to its music. In 2004, drummer Brandon Barnes stated: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of different influences from hardcore like old Cave In, to a lot of punk like Face to Face, Screeching Weasel, and Down By Law." ...|$|E

[...] In the September 9 CNN GOP debate, Huntsman suggested that the country needed more legal immigration, claiming that it will revive America's housing market, citing Vancouver's quickly growing real estate market as evidence. Huntsman also supports granting more H-1B visas to foreigners.|$|E

500|$|After Heppner {{introduced}} his bandmates to progressive rock, the band integrated minor influences from the genre in their songwriting and compositions, including touches of keyboards, while {{trying not to}} deviate too much {{from the sound of}} Hello Master. The change in style was largely adopted so they could challenge themselves musically, but not specifically to be heavier: [...] "I don't think we go in wanting to write a heavier record," [...] guitarist Dan Watchorn stated. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> preconceived notion of what we want, the riffs and melodies just kind of come. The fact that Hello Master was a bit more on the poppy side and Prior to the Fire has a bit more edge to it is just where we're at right now with music." [...] Of the end result, drummer Vince Nudo said, [...] "Our individual tastes came out more [...] [...] It's more organic. We're not holding back so much." ...|$|E

Dario Franchitti and Moreno qualified in the 22nd and 23rd positions, while Castroneves took 24th. Carpentier, who qualified in 25th, was observed speeding after he exited pit road and was limited to one lap time. On his run, he went up onto the track's dirty side in turn two and removed his foot from the accelerator pedal. Fernández qualified {{at the back of}} the grid in 26th position and turned off his engine on the backstretch while {{on his second}} warm-up lap and stopped at the bottom of turn three. After qualifying,Tagliani said: [...] "The car is very fast, the team was very quick earlier this year at Michigan and we're looking good right now. We didn't expect to qualify that fast actually, but the car was free and it was great. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good shot to stay up front with that time." ...|$|E
500|$|After a Week 8 bye, Hester caught four {{passes for}} 42 yards {{and had an}} 11-yard run against the Detroit Lions. He {{eventually}} lost his kick return duties to Danieal Manning, but began receiving more playing time as a wide receiver. Between Week 12 and 15, Hester caught 17 passes for 250 yards and one touchdown. David Haugh of the Chicago Tribune regarded Hester as the team's [...] "biggest threat in the passing game." [...] He concluded the season by catching 51 passes for a team high 665 yards. Unlike his previous two seasons in the NFL, Hester did not record a single touchdown return and only averaged 6.2 yards per punt return. Lovie Smith commented on Hester {{at the end of}} the season by saying, [...] "I know his returns dropped off a little bit this year, but his plate was full there for a while. We <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> happy medium now for him as a punt returner and continuing to develop as a receiver." [...] Hester was also selected to play in the 2009 Pro Bowl as a third alternate.|$|E

500|$|Let the Right One In was an {{international}} success. Critics lauded {{the performances of}} the young leads, often highlighting Leandersson for particular acclaim. According to Karen Durbin of Elle, she [...] "evokes Eli's radical apartness {{with an air of}} watchful caution and a contained stillness of body that not only belies her childish appearance (...)", and [...] "In a performance devoid of sentimentality she perfectly captures the awful solitude of a creature who exists outside time". James Berardinelli also praised Leandersson for [...] "crafting an individual who is both mysterious and compelling", while Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "The youthful actors imbue even the most emotional and disturbing scenes with remarkable complexity. Leandersson is particularly impressive as the conflicted young vampire who wants nothing more than to be an ordinary girl again". Luke Y. Thompson of LA Weekly compared her performance favorably to that of Kirsten Dunst as the child vampire Claudia in Interview with the Vampire. He concluded that, while Dunst [...] "used to be the gold standard; in Leandersson, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> new champion." [...] The Oregonian called Leandersson's performance [...] "incredible", and expressed doubt that any actress in the American remake could top it. While Swedish reviewers generally made positive comments about the two leads, Emma Engström of Göteborgs-Posten felt that Leandersson's character was lacking in depth.|$|E
500|$|According to Vig, Not Your Kind of People evokes ambient vibes of Garbage's {{first two}} albums, Garbage and Version 2.0: [...] "There's lots of {{elements}} of things we've always loved: noisy guitars, big electronic beats, atmospheric film moments", {{adding that the}} band [...] "wanted to make a record sound like something {{that we want to}} hear when we're driving the car." [...] While the record was reminiscent [...] "vibe-wise" [...] of the band's early work, the production aimed for a rawer sound, instead of cleaning up the sound through computers, to [...] "capture a performance" [...] and [...] "sound kind of trashy and for the songs to blow out a little bit." [...] Vig said, [...] "we tried to leave a lot of the performance raw on this album. A lot of the songs, we sort of throw paint at the wall and some of it sticks and some of it drips off." [...] He explained that the group avoided reinventing themselves: [...] "We wanted to just embrace exactly who we are and what we like to do and just sort of update it sonically for 2012. For better or worse, when we approach a song, it's going to end up sounding like Garbage. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> strong sonic identity, and I think that's an asset these days." [...] Manson similarly noted that what mattered most was the record sounding authentic to who they are as a band. Manson considered that while the record recalled the band's classic sound [...] "it fits in with radio programming right now"; She said that they are interested in also reaching a new generation and, regarding their distinct sound, [...] "We don't sound like anyone else on the radio. Much to our surprise there hasn't been another band like ours since we came off the road." ...|$|E

There was a time when an interest in the arts threw doubts on one's masculinity." [...] In 1973, historian Geoffrey Serle, in his 1973 From Deserts the Prophets Come, argued that while Australia had finally arrived at [...] "mature nationhood," [...] until that time that the [...] "most important study of Australia had been found in creative treatments", rather than academic study at universities and schools.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the version}} with Bardot was recorded, the French press {{reported}} {{that it was an}} [...] "audio vérité". France Dimanche said the [...] "groans, sighs, and Bardot's little cries of pleasure [...] the impression you're listening to two people making love". The first time Gainsbourg played it in public was in a Paris restaurant immediately after they recorded it. Birkin said that [...] "as it began to play all you could hear were the knives and forks being put down. 'I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hit record', he said." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band's {{second album}} Live Through This, {{captured}} a less abrasive sound, {{while maintaining the}} group's original punk roots. [...] "I want this record to be shocking {{to the people who}} don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> soft edge, and at the same time, [...] that we haven't lost our very, very hard edge," [...] Love told VH1 in 1994. The group's third album, Celebrity Skin, incorporated power pop into their hard rock sound, and was heavily inspired by California bands; Love was also influenced by Fleetwood Mac and My Bloody Valentine while writing the album. The group's 2010 release, Nobody's Daughter, featured a more folk rock-oriented sound, utilizing acoustic guitar and softer melodies.|$|E

2500|$|It was announced, after airing {{thirteen}} episodes, {{that the}} new run of Iron Chef would be discontinued after the last episode on March 22, 2013. Mr. Tatematsu, General Manager of Editing, explained, "Iron Chef is a high quality show and we can say it is FujiTV's treasure. Currently we are struggling for the ratings. We <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> time slot problem, too, so {{we would like to}} consider about a way to make it as special program and forward it into the next stage." [...] On July 3, 2013 the Iron Chefs reunited for an American Chef Special with beef as the secret ingredient.

2500|$|Live Through This {{marked a}} {{departure}} from the band's noise rock roots toward a more radio-friendly rock format. Love had sought a more mellow sound for Live Through This, stating: [...] "I want this record to be shocking to the people who don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> soft edge, and at the same time, [...] that we haven't lost our very, very hard edge." [...] The resulting music was starkly less aggressive than the band's former work, blending more structured melodies and smoother arrangements with heavy guitar riffs. [...] "During the tour for Pretty on the Inside, we had been going more pop, less journal-entry noise stuff," [...] recalled Erlandson. [...] "The whole industry was going, like, [...] "Look, you can be melodic and punky and be successful!" [...] We never said [...] "Let's do this, let's copy this formula." [...] It was natural." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011, {{days before}} the release of The Hangover Part II, {{director}} Todd Phillips said that [...] "there already are plans for a third film but no script or start date". About the possibility of The Hangover Part III, Phillips stated, [...] "If we were to do a third one, if the audience, if the desire was there, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very clear idea where that would head. It's certainly {{not in the same}} template that you've seen these movies. The third would be very much a finale and an ending. The most I could say about it, what's in my head, and I haven't discussed it with these actors, {{is that it is not}} following that template but very much a new idea. As far as where it takes place, I said I'm very open." [...] Also during May, Craig Mazin, who co-wrote The Hangover Part II, entered early talks to write the script for the third installment.|$|E

[...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> fresh approach because we’d never worked on a campaign before” — and, of course, the power of the logo <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot to do with “the power of the candidate’s message." ...|$|R
2500|$|Guadalajara, due to {{the ongoing}} Mexican Drug War, has seen {{escalating}} violence. Some countries, including the United States and Canada, expressed concerns about the safety and security of the region. Scott Backmun of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) raised concerns about the city's ability to host the games {{in light of the}} drug war. Due to the increased safety issues the USOC had its own security plan for the games. During a meeting of the USOC in March 2011, chief security officer Larry Buendorf gave a report {{to the rest of the}} committee in which he said, [...] "We’re going to prepare for Guadalajara like we would any other Games. A lot of that is just preparing your athletes for the individual environments that they’re going into. Everybody is quite aware of the violence that has happened. We’re obviously concerned about it, and at the end of the day, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good security plan in place to try to protect our athletes". After grenades were thrown near a nightclub entrance in two separate incidents in February 2011, organizers said they were making security a priority and arranged for police and members of the armed forces to patrol in Guadalajara throughout the games.|$|E
2500|$|While analysts {{generally}} {{agree that}} the CPC has rejected orthodox Marxism–Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought (or at least basic thoughts within orthodox thinking), the CPC itself disagrees. Some Western commentators also talk about a [...] "crisis of ideology" [...] within the party; {{they believe that the}} CPC has rejected communism. Wang Xuedong, the Director of the Institute of World Socialism, said in response, [...] "We know there are those abroad who <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> 'crisis of ideology,' but we do not agree." [...] According to Jiang Zemin, the CPC [...] "must never discard Marxism–Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.” He said that “if we did, we would lose our foundation.” He further noted that Marxism in general [...] "like any science, needs to change as time and circumstances advance." [...] Certain groups argue that Jiang Zemin ended the CPC's formal commitment to Marxism with the introduction of the ideological theory, the Three Represents. However, party theorist Leng Rong disagrees, claiming that [...] "President Jiang rid the Party of the ideological obstacles to different kinds of ownership [...] He did not give up Marxism or socialism. He strengthened the Party by providing a modern understanding of Marxism and socialism—which is why we talk about a ‘socialist market economy’ with Chinese characteristics." [...] Marxism in its core is, according to Jiang Zemin, methodology and the goal of a future, classless society, not analyses of class and of the contradictions between different classes.|$|E
2500|$|Jordan Thomas, BioShock 2s {{creative}} director, {{said that}} the first concern with a sequel to BioShock was [...] "where do you go with this? How do you bring people back to an experience and terrify them and shock {{them in a way}} that they’re not expecting, but also fulfill the many expectations they’re projecting onto it?" [...] Early on, Thomas decided that it couldn't be a BioShock game without the city of Rapture, and that there were many unseen locations and untold stories that could remained with the setting. The developers wanted to bring some of the mystery back to the location of Rapture, and maintain a balance of surprising old players while introducing the setting to newcomers. Thomas and environmental artist Hogarth De La Plante agreed that the setting of Rapture was fertile ground for new ideas, and that as they were both veterans of the original game, they were excited to add never-before-seen parts of the city and push the artistic style they had developed. [...] "Any idea was out on the table at that point, and I think nobody has played BioShock more than the developers that made it, so I feel like in one respect we are a pretty good litmus test for whether it’s still an interesting place or not," [...] La Plante recalled. [...] "And if that doesn’t bore us and we’re the people that played it for thousands upon thousands of hours, then I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> pretty good perspective on how interesting that location really is." ...|$|E
