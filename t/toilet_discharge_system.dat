40|$|Indian Railways (IR) {{is a large}} {{transport}} organization running 8700 trains, reaching 7000 {{stations and}} handling about 1. 6 crore passengers per day. IR runs several long distant trains, some of which involve journeys upto three nights. The number of non suburban passengers traveling on IR is about 0. 6 crore per day. There are three sources of fecal matter generation in IR (i) Toilets in trains, (ii) Railway stations; and (iii) Use of railway tracks for open defecation. The existing toilet system in the coaches discharges excreta directly {{to the ground and}} the railway tracks. The consequences include unacceptable hygienic conditions, particularly in the railway stations, and damage to rails. IR is making efforts to introduce environment friendly <b>toilet</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>system,</b> for which three options are being considered; modular, vacuum and chemical. Toilets at stations are a part of amenities being provided, linked to the category of the station. There is an attempt to modernize toilets at important stations. A related socio economic problem is that of people residing near the railway stations, without access to toilet facilities, using tracks for open defecation. The issue of dealing with fecal matter should be viewed in the larger context of waste management. With effective waste management, fecal matter can be recycled and used as liquid fertilizers and quality organic manures. This paper attempts to understand the issues related to fecal matter management on the IR, and provide a framework for solutions. ...|$|E
40|$|Indian Railways {{was being}} roundly criticized for {{creating}} an environment hazard by <b>discharging</b> <b>toilet</b> waste on tracks. IR coaches have toilet {{system that has}} hole on the floor through which human feces and urine is flushed directly on railway tracks. Various types of environment friendly Green toilets have put on outfields trials by Indian Railways to overcome this problem. Controlled <b>Discharge</b> <b>Toilet</b> <b>System</b> (CDTS), Bio-toilet developed by Indian Railways engineers and DRDO biotechnologists, development of Zero <b>Discharge</b> <b>Toilet</b> <b>System</b> (ZDTS) by IIT Kanpur and Research Development and Standards Organization (RDSO) Lucknow, are some efforts in this direction. These technologies are more expensive due to inherent complexities, disposal problem at yards (ZDTS) and requirement of extra infrastructure at the terminal. FFEM approach not only solves these problems but also convert toilet waste into energy which can be utilized further in lighting at platforms or some other useful purposes...|$|R
40|$|Greywater {{consists}} of household wastewater excluding <b>toilet</b> <b>discharges.</b> Three <b>systems</b> were compared for the biological treatment of greywater {{at a similar}} hydraulic retention time of approximately 12 â€“ 13 hours. These systems were aerobic treatment in a sequencing batch reactor, anaerobic treatment in an up-flow anaerobic blanket reactor and combined anaerobic-aerobic treatment (up-flow anaerobic blanket reactor + sequencing batch reactor). Aerobic conditions resulted in a COD removal of 90 %, which {{was significantly higher than}} 51 % removal by anaerobic treatment. The low removal in the anaerobic reactor may have been caused by high concentration of anionic surfactants in the influent (43. 5 mg/L) and a poor removal of the colloidal fraction of the COD in up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors. Combined aerobic-anaerobic treatment accomplished a COD removal of 89 %, similar to the aerobic treatment alone. Greywater methanization was 32 % for the anaerobic system and 25 % for the anaerobic-aerobic system, yielding a small amount of energy. Therefore, anaerobic pre-treatment is not feasible and an aerobic system is preferred for the treatment of greywate...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with the development and thermal design of a fast <b>discharge</b> <b>system</b> for balls for the PR 3000 MW$-{th}$ process heat reactor. The term "fast <b>discharge</b> <b>system</b> for balls" denotes a very short-time discharge procedure of the entire core contents, i. e. the flowing out of the fuel elements due to gravity into a-receiver tank underneath the prestressed-concrete vessel. From a safety-engineering point of view, the fast <b>discharge</b> <b>system</b> for balls constitutes an additional possibility of active decay heat, removal, besides the multiply redundant and diversitary reactor protection system, serving to further reduce the remaining residual risk. A fast <b>discharge</b> <b>system</b> for balls, however, is to be used only in the event of all the other possibilities of active decay heat removal having failed and when the maximum permissible temperatures for particularly exposed primary circuit components have been reached. However, the application range of such a system is restricted exclusively to high-temperature reactors with spherical fuel elements; the procedure cannot be applied tp-other /reactor^systems because ofthe rigidly fixed position of the fuel elements inside the core and for reasons of fuel element geometry. Besides the purpose of application, the influence of in-core temperature development on the possible actuation of the fast <b>discharge</b> <b>system</b> is being described in particular detail. This is followed by a description of the structural and thermal design of three specific major components, i. e. the piping system, shut-off devices and fuel element receiver tank, which will have to be installed additionally for the implementation of a fast <b>discharge</b> <b>system</b> for balls as compared to previous plant concepts...|$|R

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} hold significant {{promise for}} {{a vast number}} of materials applications due to their unique mechanical, electrical, and gas storage properties. Although carbon single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs) have been synthesized since 1993 by the arc discharge method, and numerous other synthesis methods have since been developed, no method has yet produced 100 % pure carbon nanotubes. Instead, a significant amount of impuritiesâ€”various carbon structures and metal catalystsâ€”are present in the raw soot. While arc discharge was the first method for SWNT synthesis, it also produces more impure raw soot in comparison to the more recently developed laser vaporization, which has produced the purest raw soot to date but is much slower. Geometry and thermal gradient are appreciably different between traditional arc <b>discharge</b> <b>systems</b> and laser vaporization systems. We report that, by incorporating some characteristics inherent to a laser vaporization system into an arc <b>discharge</b> <b>system,</b> improvement in the yield of SWNT raw soot may be achieved. This is accomplished by confining the arc within a 50 mm diameter quartz tube, similar to laser vaporization. We find through transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy that SWNTs are made in significant numbers in this confined arc <b>discharge</b> <b>system,</b> comparable to laser vaporization synthesized material. Further study is, however, required to prove reproducibility and attain an exact value for the purity of the produced raw soot...|$|R
