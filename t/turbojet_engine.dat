5|$|Around 1954, NATC {{modified}} the sole surviving XAJ-1 to conduct inflight refueling tests using the probe and drogue configuration. The <b>turbojet</b> <b>engine</b> was removed and the fuel hose and its drogue extended {{out from the}} jet's former exhaust opening. Aircraft in service retained the turbojet and had their bomb bay doors modified to accommodate the hose and drogue. They were refueling aircraft during late 1954.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Republic Aviation's chief designer, Alexander Kartveli, {{began working}} on a turbojet-powered {{replacement}} for the P-47 Thunderbolt piston-engined fighter. The initial attempts to redesign the P-47 to accommodate a jet engine proved futile due to the large cross-section of the early centrifugal compressor turbojets. Instead, Kartveli and his team designed a new aircraft with a streamlined fuselage largely occupied by an axial compressor <b>turbojet</b> <b>engine</b> and fuel stored in rather thick unswept wings.|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{analysis}} of {{performance of a}} ducted-fan power plant designed both for high-output, high-altitude operation at low supersonic Mach numbers and for good fuel economy at lower fight speeds is presented. Performance of ducted fan is compared with performance (with and without tail-pipe burner) of two hypothetical <b>turbojet</b> <b>engines.</b> At maximum power, the ducted fan has propulsive thrust per unit of frontal area between thrusts obtained by <b>turbojet</b> <b>engines</b> with and without tail-pipe burners. At cruise, the ducted fan obtains lowest thrust specific fuel consumption. For equal maximum thrusts, the ducted fan obtains cruising flight duration and range appreciably greater than <b>turbojet</b> <b>engines...</b>|$|R

5|$|When an Iowa class {{battleship}} fired a Harpoon Missile, {{a booster}} propelled the missile {{away from the}} ship; after approximately , the booster dropped away. After the booster was discarded a <b>turbojet</b> <b>engine</b> ignited and propelled the missile to the target. The stabilizing and actuator fins, which helped to guide the missile to its target, were stored folded in the canister and sprang into position after launching. These fins directed the missile to the target through inputs from the AN/SWG-1 Harpoon Fire Control System.|$|E
5|$|The XF6U {{was a small}} {{aircraft}} with tricycle {{landing gear}} and with straight wings and tail surfaces. The wings were short enough {{that they did not}} need to fold. In order to fit more aircraft into crowded hangars, the nose gear could be retracted and the aircraft's weight would rest on a small wheel attached by the ground crew. This raised the tail up so that it could overlap the nose of the aircraft behind it, allowing more aircraft to fit into available hangar space. The <b>turbojet</b> <b>engine</b> was mounted {{in the rear of the}} fuselage and was fed by ducts in each wing root.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, {{in the face}} of the {{emerging}} Cold War scenario, the RAF came to recognise that it would urgently require the development and procurement of fighters equipped with features such as swept wings. By this time, it had also become apparent that newly developed jet propulsion would form the future of fighter aircraft development. Many companies were quick to devise their own designs to harness this means of propulsion. Hawker Aviation's chief designer, Sydney Camm, had proposed the Hawker P.1040 for the RAF, but the demonstrator failed to interest them. Further modifications to the basic design resulted in the Hawker Sea Hawk carrier-based fighter. However, the Sea Hawk possessed a straight wing and was powered by the Rolls-Royce Nene <b>turbojet</b> <b>engine,</b> both features that rapidly became obsolete.|$|E

25|$|Petter {{believed}} that a compact and simplified fighter would offer the advantages of low purchase and operational costs, and that the Gnat should be capable of being manufactured both cheaply and easily. The emergence of new lightweight turbojet engines, several of which were well advanced in their own development process, also enabled the envisioned light fighter concept to be realised. The Gnat was initially intended to be powered by a Bristol BE-22 Saturn <b>turbojet</b> <b>engine,</b> capable of generating 3,800lbf (16.9kN 1,724 kgp) of thrust. However, development of the Saturn was cancelled; in its place, the more capable but not immediately available Bristol Orpheus <b>turbojet</b> <b>engine</b> was adopted instead.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Kh-55 had a drop-down engine; the Kh-65SE had a fixed external <b>turbojet</b> <b>engine,</b> whilst the Kh-SD had {{its engine}} {{inside the body}} of the missile.

25|$|The RAF {{requirements}} {{were subject}} to some changes, mainly in regards to radar equipment and armaments; Gloster also initiated some changes as further research was conducted into the aerodynamic properties of the new swept and delta wings, as well as use of the new Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire <b>turbojet</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1960, the Bell Rocketbelt was {{presented}} to the public.
