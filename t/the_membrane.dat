5|$|As the {{electrons}} pass through this complex, four protons are pumped from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Exactly how this occurs is unclear, {{but it seems}} to involve conformational changes in complex I that cause the protein to bind protons on the N-side of <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> and release them on the P-side of <b>the</b> <b>membrane.</b> Finally, {{the electrons}} are transferred from the chain of iron–sulfur clusters to a ubiquinone molecule in <b>the</b> <b>membrane.</b> Reduction of ubiquinone also contributes to the generation of a proton gradient, as two protons are taken up from the matrix as it is reduced to ubiquinol (QH2).|$|E
5|$|The plasma {{membrane}} is a phospholipid bilayer membrane {{that separates the}} cell from its environment and regulates the transport of molecules and signals {{into and out of}} the cell. Embedded in <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> are proteins that perform the functions of the {{plasma membrane}}. The plasma membrane is not a fixed or rigid structure, the molecules that compose <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> are capable of lateral movement. This movement and the multiple components of <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> are why it is referred to as a fluid mosaic. Smaller molecules such as carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen can pass through the plasma membrane freely by diffusion or osmosis. Larger molecules needed by the cell are assisted by proteins through active transport.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} types of vesicles each with a {{different}} protein configuration. Most are formed from specific regions of membranes. When a vesicle buds off from a membrane it contains specific proteins on its cytosolic surface. Each membrane a vesicle travels to contains a marker on its cytosolic surface.

5|$|Within {{the inner}} {{mitochondrial}} membrane, the lipid-soluble electron carrier coenzyme Q10 (Q) carries both electrons and protons by a redox cycle. This small benzoquinone molecule is very hydrophobic, so it diffuses freely within <b>the</b> <b>membrane.</b> When Q accepts two electrons and two protons, it becomes {{reduced to the}} ubiquinol form (QH2); when QH2 releases two electrons and two protons, it becomes oxidized back to the ubiquinone (Q) form. As a result, if two enzymes are arranged so that Q is reduced {{on one side of}} <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> and QH2 oxidized on the other, ubiquinone will couple these reactions and shuttle protons across <b>the</b> <b>membrane.</b> Some bacterial electron transport chains use different quinones, such as menaquinone, in addition to ubiquinone.|$|E

5|$|As {{coenzyme}} Q {{is reduced}} to ubiquinol {{on the inner side}} of <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> and oxidized to ubiquinone on the other, a net transfer of protons across <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> occurs, adding to the proton gradient. The rather complex two-step mechanism by which this occurs is important, as it increases the efficiency of proton transfer.

5|$|Axons {{transmit}} {{signals to}} other neurons {{by means of}} specialized junctions called synapses. A single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells. When an action potential, traveling along an axon, arrives at a synapse, it causes a chemical called a neurotransmitter to be released.

5|$|In {{addition}} to these universal functions, the plasma membrane has a more specific role in multicellular organisms. Glycoproteins on <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> assist the cell in recognizing other cells, in order to exchange metabolites and form tissues. Other proteins on the plasma membrane allow attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix; a function that maintains cell shape and fixes the location of membrane proteins. Enzymes that catalyze reactions are also found on the plasma membrane. Receptor proteins on <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> have a shape that matches with a chemical messenger, resulting in various cellular responses.|$|E
40|$|Adenyl cyclase {{activity}} in mucous acinar cells and serous demilune {{cells of the}} rat sublingual gland was localized cytochemically. After incubation with adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) as substrate, deposits of reaction product are found along <b>the</b> cell <b>membranes</b> bordering <b>the</b> secretory surfaces of serous demilune cells.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the preparation, characterization and applications of microstructured membranes. Phase Separation MicroFabrication (PSµF) {{is used to}} prepare <b>the</b> <b>membranes.</b> This technique relies on using microstructured silicon or metal templates during the preparation of <b>the</b> <b>membranes</b> and transferring <b>the</b> microstructure of these templates to <b>the</b> <b>membranes</b> during <b>the</b> phase inversion process which forms <b>the</b> <b>membranes.</b> <b>The</b> main focus {{of the work is}} on hollow fiber membranes with microstructured outer or inner surfaces. The fabrication of these <b>membranes</b> and <b>the</b> effect of various parameters on the microstructure, the permeability and separation properties of <b>the</b> <b>membranes</b> are described. <b>The</b> fouling behavior of these membranes is explored in dead-end, cross-flow and submerged and aerated filtration operations.

5|$|Many {{types of}} cells export {{proteins}} produced by ribosomes {{attached to the}} rough ER. The ribosomes assemble amino acids into protein units, which are carried into the rough ER for further adjustments.

Those that reach {{the inside of the}} endoplasmic reticulum are folded into the correct three-dimensional conformation.

40|$|Novel adsorptive {{ultrafiltration}} membranes were manufactured from synthesized polyvinyltetrazole−co−polyacrylonitrile (PVT−co−PAN) by nonsolvent induced {{phase separation}} (NIPS). PVT−co−PAN with various degree of functionalization (DF) was synthesized via a [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction at 60 °C using a commercial PAN. PVT−co−PAN with varied DF was then explored to prepare adsorptive <b>membranes.</b> <b>The</b> <b>membranes</b> {{were characterized by}} surface zeta potential and static water contact angle measurements, scanning electron microscopy as well as atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques. It was shown that PVT segments contributed to alter the pore size, charge and hydrophilic behavior of <b>the</b> <b>membranes.</b> <b>The</b> <b>membranes</b> became more negatively charged and hydrophilic after addition of PVT segments. The PVT segments in <b>the</b> <b>membranes</b> served as <b>the</b> major binding sites for adsorption of Cu(II) ions from aqueous solution. The maximum adsorption of Cu(II) ions by <b>the</b> <b>membranes</b> in static condition and in a continuous ultrafiltration of 10 ppm solution was attained at pH = 5.

5|$|The patagium is {{the wing}} membrane. The patagium is {{stretched}} between {{the arm and}} hand bones, down the lateral {{side of the body}} and down to the hind limbs. This skin membrane consists of connective tissue, elastic fibers, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. The muscles keep <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> taut during flight. The skin on the body of the bat, which has one layer of epidermis and dermis, as well as the presence of hair follicles, sweat glands and a fatty subcutaneous layer, {{is very different from the}} skin of the wing membrane. The patagium is an extremely thin double layer of epidermis; these layers are separated by a connective tissue center, rich with collagen and elastic fibers. <b>The</b> <b>membrane</b> has no hair follicles or sweat glands, except between the fingers. Unlike birds whose stiff wings deliver bending and torsional stress to the shoulders, bats have a flexible wing membrane which can only resist tension. To achieve flight, a bat exerts force inwards at the points where <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> meets the skeleton, so that an opposing force balances it on the wing edges perpendicular to the wing surface. However, this adaptation does not permit bats to reduce their wingspan as birds do, which means they cannot travel over long distances like birds can.|$|E

5|$|When the sinoatrial {{cells are}} resting, {{they have a}} {{negative}} charge on their membranes. However a rapid influx of sodium ions causes the membrane's charge to become positive.

All the ions travel through ion channels in <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> of the sinoatrial cells. The potassium and calcium only start {{to move out of}} and into the cell once it has a sufficiently high charge, and so are called voltage-gated. Shortly after this, the calcium channels close and potassium channels open, allowing potassium to leave the cell. This causes the cell to have a negative resting charge and is called repolarization. When <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> potential reaches approximately −60 mV, the potassium channels close and the process may begin again.|$|E
