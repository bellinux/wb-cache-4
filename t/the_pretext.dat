5|$|An {{important}} event following {{the conquest of}} the Carpathian Basin, the Bavarians' murder of Kurszán, was recorded by the longer version of the Annals of Saint Gall, the Annales Alamannici and the Annals of Einsiedeln.

The three chronicles unanimously state that the Bavarians invited the Hungarian leader to a dinner on <b>the</b> <b>pretext</b> of negotiating a peace treaty and treacherously assassinated him.

40|$|This article aims {{to explore}} and to apply what Gérard Genette refers to as kinds of transtextual {{relationships}} and what Ulrich Luz, in his application of these insights to the Gospel of Matthew, calls the encyclopaedia of the author or the original readers. The former enterprise entails exploring intertextuality at the synchronic level and the latter examines intertextuality at the diachronic level. The first pertains to Matthew’s <b>pretexts.</b> <b>The</b> second enterprise entails an engagement with pragmatical aspects such as {{the context of the}} intended readers and the sedimentation of prior texts designated by the notion intertextuality. In this article the pragmatical aspects concern a discussion of {{the manner in which the}} first readers could be addressed by <b>the</b> <b>pretexts</b> of <b>the</b> use of the word sōzō (‘to save’). It consists of three parts. The first represents a concise reflection on criteria and methods relevant to an investigation of intertextuality. The second exemplifies the ‘encyclopedia’ of Matthew’s intertextuality, that is ‘intertext’, ‘paratext’, ‘hypertext’, ‘hypotext’, ‘architext’, and ‘metatext’. The third part discusses <b>the</b> <b>pretexts</b> of <b>the</b> various occurrences of the word sōzō in Matthew...|$|R

5|$|A new {{fleet and}} army was raised and built under Ali's leadership, and on 31 October 1831, his son Ibrahim Pasha {{launched}} {{an invasion of}} Syria, which initiated the First Egyptian–Ottoman War.

5|$|As discussed, the Chalkidian League {{had made}} peace with Athens in 352 BC, in clear breach of their {{alliance}} with Philip, due to their growing fear of Macedonian power. Cawkwell contends that from that moment on, Olynthos and the League were doomed. However, {{the next few years}} of Philip's reign appear to have been militarily quiet; Diodorus does not mention any activity by Philip until 349 BC. Philip did not yet make any further efforts to intervene in the Sacred War, which was to rumble on until 346 BC. In the meantime, there may have been some unrest in Macedonia; Philip executed one of his stepbrothers (sons of Amyntas III's second wife), and two more fled to Olynthos. According to Justin, this provided Philip with <b>the</b> <b>pretext</b> of attacking Olynthos and the Chalkidian League.|$|E
