Magpies will become accustomed to being fed by humans, and although they are wild, will return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>place</b> looking for handouts. The idea is that humans thereby appear less {{of a threat to}} the nesting birds. Although this has not been studied systematically, there are reports of its success.|$|E

Will and Vince D'Angelo (Bobby Cannavale) have since reconciled, and are raising a son, Ben. Karen and Jack grow tired {{of the fact that}} Will and Grace are not {{speaking}} with each other, so they lure them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>place</b> and force them to make up. The four meet at Will and Vince's apartment, and even though Will and Grace have a pleasant evening together, they find that too much has changed between them, and drift apart.|$|E
5|$|Rudy's {{attraction}} to the veterinarian's wife leads to them having consensual sex {{in front of her}} husband. Humiliated, the vet hangs himself in a motel bathroom. Rudy and Fran move on, barely acknowledging the suicide. They check into an El Paso hotel used by criminals as a safe house because Rudy knows that the McCoys will be heading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>place.</b> When Doc and Carol check in at the hotel, they ask for food to be delivered, but the manager, Laughlin, says he is working alone and cannot leave the desk. Doc soon realizes that Laughlin sent his family away because something is about to happen. He urges Carol to dress quickly so they can escape. An armed Rudy comes to their door while Fran poses as a delivery girl who needs to be paid for the food. Peering from an adjacent doorway, Doc is surprised to see Rudy alive. He sneaks up behind Rudy, knocks him out, and does the same to Fran.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{story to}} feature a beheading game is the 8th-century Middle Irish tale Bricriu's Feast. This story parallels Gawain in that, like the Green Knight, Cú Chulainn's antagonist feints three blows with the axe before letting his target depart without injury. A beheading exchange also {{appears in the}} late 12th-century Life of Caradoc, a Middle French narrative embedded in the anonymous First Continuation of Chrétien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail. A notable difference in this story is that Caradoc's challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. Lancelot is given a beheading challenge in the early 13th-century Perlesvaus, in which a knight begs him to chop off his head or else put his own in jeopardy. Lancelot reluctantly cuts it off, agreeing to come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>place</b> in a year to put {{his head in the}} same danger. When Lancelot arrives, the people of the town celebrate and announce that they have finally found a true knight, because many others had failed this test of chivalry.|$|E

25|$|Gopher {{tortoises}} {{have been}} kept as pets, preventing them from reproducing in their local populations. Captured gopher tortoises can be raced in tortoise races. This practice was banned in Florida in 1989. Moving a tortoise can lead to harmful consequences to the environment from which it came, because the tortoise is often not returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>place</b> where it was found. Also, as tortoise racing involves several tortoises {{in close proximity to}} one another, diseases can easily spread from one tortoise to another. If an infected captive tortoise is then returned to the environment, other tortoises may be infected.|$|E
25|$|A closed timelike curve can {{be created}} if a series of such light cones are set up so as to loop back on themselves, {{so it would be}} {{possible}} for an object to move around this loop and return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>place</b> and time that it started. An object in such an orbit would repeatedly return to the same point in spacetime if it stays in free fall. Returning to the original spacetime location would be only one possibility; the object's future light cone would include spacetime points both forwards and backwards in time, and so it should be possible for the object to engage in time travel under these conditions.|$|E
