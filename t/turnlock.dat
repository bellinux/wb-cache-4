5000|$|Invented and {{patented}} by an American engineer of Ukrainian descent William Dzus (Volodymyr Dzhus) {{in the early}} 1930s, Dzus fasteners are also used to secure plates, doors, and panels that require frequent removal for inspection and servicing. These fasteners are notable {{in that they are}} of an [...] "over-centre" [...] design, requiring positive sustained torque to unfasten. Thus, any minor disturbance to the fastener (e.g. vibration) will tend to correct itself rather than proceed to further loosening as it would in threaded fasteners. <b>Turnlock</b> fasteners are available in several different styles and are usually referred to by the manufacturer's trade name. Some of the most common are DZUS, Camloc, and Airloc.|$|E
