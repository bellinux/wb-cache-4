5|$|Krishna-related {{literature}} {{such as the}} Bhagavata Purana accords {{a metaphysical}} significance to the performances and treats them as religious ritual, infusing daily life with spiritual meaning, thus representing a good, honest, happy life. Similarly, Krishna-inspired performances aim to cleanse the hearts of faithful actors and listeners. Singing, dancing, and performance of any part of Krishna Lila {{is an act of}} remembering the dharma in the text, as a form of para bhakti (supreme devotion). To remember Krishna at any time and in any art, asserts the text, is to worship <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> divine.|$|E
5|$|When King Edward {{died at the}} {{beginning}} of 1066, the lack of a clear heir led to a disputed succession in which several contenders laid claim to the throne of England. Edward's immediate successor was the Earl of Wessex, Harold Godwinson, the richest and most powerful of the English aristocrats. Harold was elected king by the Witenagemot of England and crowned by the Archbishop of York, Ealdred, although Norman propaganda claimed the ceremony was performed by Stigand, the uncanonically elected Archbishop of Canterbury. Harold was immediately challenged by two powerful neighbouring rulers. Duke William claimed that he had been promised the throne by King Edward and that Harold had sworn agreement to this; King Harald III of Norway, commonly known as Harald Hardrada, also contested the succession. His claim to the throne was based on an agreement between his predecessor, Magnus <b>the</b> <b>Good,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> earlier English king, Harthacnut, whereby if either died without heir, the other would inherit both England and Norway. William and Harald at once set about assembling troops and ships to invade England.|$|E
25|$|Meta-ethics is {{the study}} of the {{fundamental}} questions concerning the nature and origins of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> evil, including inquiry into the nature of good and evil, as well as the meaning of evaluative language.

25|$|In the {{earliest}} Vedic literature, all supernatural beings are called Asuras. By the late Vedic period (~500 BCE), benevolent supernatural beings {{are referred to}} as Deva-Asuras.

25|$|Control of or {{at least}} {{inclusion}} {{in the creation of}} a cultural epic is important because the traditional epic poem like The Odyssey or Virgil’s Aeneid is, at its core, a written history. Written history defines <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bad of a culture, the winners and losers, and the author of that history controls the very future by manipulating the knowledge of later generations. For Friedman to deny epic associations to the long poem because they are sometimes written by women is to counter the efforts of many female long poets.|$|E

25|$|The mythical {{stories told}} for Diwali vary {{regionally}} {{and within the}} traditions of Hinduism.

It is a metaphor for resisting evil, for dispelling darkness and for compassion to others.

25|$|An {{important}} {{research problem}} is the controversial question {{of the status of}} the Form of the Good within the metaphysical system derived from a combination of the Theory of Forms and the two principles of the reconstruction. The resolution of this issue depends upon how one interprets the status Plato gives to the Good in his Theory of Forms. Some believe that Plato's Republic sharply contrasts <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> usual Forms, and gives the Good a uniquely high rank. This accords with his conviction that all the other Forms owe their Being to the Form of the Good, and are thus ontologically subordinated to it.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} on his Ethics is scanty. He tried {{to supplement the}} Platonic doctrine at various points, {{and at the same}} time to give it a more direct applicability to life. He distinguished from <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bad something which is neither good nor bad. Following the ideas of his Academic predecessors, he viewed the good as that which should be striven after for itself, that is, which has value in itself, while the bad is the opposite of this. Consequently, that which is neither good nor bad is what in itself is neither to be striven after nor to be avoided, but derives value or the opposite according as it serves as means for what is good or bad, or rather, is used by us for that purpose.|$|E

25|$|The applied {{perspective}} {{views the}} linguistic {{exploitation of the}} Internet {{in terms of its}} communicative capabilities – <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bad. The Internet provides a platform where users can experience multilingualism. Although English is still the dominant language used on the Internet, other languages are gradually increasing in their number of users. The Global Internet usage page provides some information on the number of users of the Internet by language, nationality and geography. This multilingual environment continues to increase in diversity as more language communities become connected to the Internet. The Internet is thus a platform where minority and endangered languages can seek to revive their language use and/or create awareness. This can be seen in two instances where it provides these languages opportunities for progress in two important regards - language documentation and language revitalization.|$|E
25|$|The older {{view that}} Plato's public lecture {{occurred}} late in Plato's {{career has been}} energetically denied by Hans Krämer. He argues that the lecture {{was held in the}} early period of Plato's activity as a teacher. Moreover, he says, the lecture was not given in public only once. It is more probable, he says, that there was a series of lectures and only the first introductory lecture was, as an experiment, open to a broad and unprepared audience. After the failure of this public debut, Plato drew the conclusion that his doctrines should only be shared with philosophy students. The lecture on <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ensuing discussions formed part of an ongoing series of talks, in which Plato regularly over the period of several decades made his students familiar with the unwritten doctrines. He was holding these sessions already by the time of this first trip to Sicily (c. 389/388) and thus before he founded the Academy.|$|E
25|$|However, the 'Bandić problem' {{escalated}} in {{the coming}} months as the media continued to speculate about his potential candidacy. Bandić started to travel throughout Croatia without a stated common agenda, and the press followed his every step and constantly asked him if he would run for the presidency. He consistently refused to comment, drawing more and more media attention with his indecisiveness. Finally, the drama was concluded when he officially announced his candidacy for president in a speech on 5 November at 7am on Sljeme criticizing Zoran Milanović and his former party for turning against him saying {{that he was one of}} the founders of SDP emphasizing that he stood with the party through <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bad times. Bandić was automatically expelled from SDP, losing his position as a member of party's presidency and leader of the Zagreb branch of SDP. Despite that, he declared on Croatian national television HRT that he still finds himself as true Social Democrat and that he'll proudly keep his SDP membership card nr. 2. SDP later made a statement that Bandić's membership card number was 38159.|$|E

25|$|Four {{years later}} (the {{timeline}} of Soulcalibur II, Soulcalibur III and Soulcalibur IV), news reach {{her that the}} Emperor destroyed and massacred Xiwei, the center of government in the Empire's western territory under the public justification of a revolt, believing that the fortress had been withholding Soul Edge from him. He asks Xianghua to investigate the ruins, as her experience could be useful in locating the sword among the rubble. Xianghua finds out the truth behind the attack from Ming spies. Though she believed that she had destroyed Soul Edge, pieces of it are rumored to exist in this place and so Xianghua decides to find every fragment and destroy them. She lefts on a second journey alone, convinced {{that this was a}} burden she has to bear after she failed to destroy Soul Edge completely the first time. During her adventure, Xianghua is reunited with Kilik. While on their journey, they are attacked by Zasalamel, who gravely injures Kilik. Xianghua takes Kilik back to his home, where she hears that he would make full recovery. After leaving a letter for him, she departs seeking an old general whom Edge Master has arranged for her to meet. Training with the general, Xianghua's skills improve significantly but she is unable to shake off an overwhelming feeling of inadequacy due to her failure to help Kilik. On the general's sage advice, she then begins to train her mind to become more fluid and allow her heart to filter in both <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bad. After months of training, she feels that she was ready and bid farewell to the general, beginning her journey anew to fight by herself. While traveling west on the Silk Road, she reunites with Kilik.

500|$|Authors such as Keith Critchlow {{argue that}} Islamic {{patterns}} are created {{to lead the}} viewer {{to an understanding of}} the underlying reality, rather than being mere decoration, as writers interested only in pattern sometimes imply.

[...] Against this, Doris Behrens-Abouseif states in her book Beauty in Arabic Culture that a [...] "major difference" [...] between the philosophical thinking of Medieval Europe and the Islamic world is exactly that the concepts of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> beautiful are separated in Arabic culture.
