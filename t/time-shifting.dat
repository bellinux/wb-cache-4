40|$|We propose new {{classes of}} {{quadratic}} time-frequency representations (QTFRs), e. g. the hyperbolic and power classes, that satisfy {{the scale and}} generalized <b>time-shift</b> covariance properties important in many signal analysis applications. Scale covariance is important for multiresolution analysis; generalized <b>time-shift</b> covariance is important for analyzing signals propagating through systems with group delay-dependent dispersion characteristics. We formulate the generalized QTFRs in terms of two-dimensional kernels, and provide QTFR properties with corresponding kernel constraints. We obtain generalized <b>time-shift</b> covariant QTFRs based on arbitrary group delays by using a generalized warping on Cohen 2 ̆ 7 s time-frequency shift covariant class or the affine class of scale and <b>time-shift</b> covariant QTFRs. We also derive the generalized version of the Wigner distribution that, like the well-known Wigner distribution, satisfies many desirable properties. ^ We can derive the hyperbolic class (HC) axiomatically by satisfying the scale and hyperbolic <b>time-shift</b> covariance properties, or by applying a hyperbolic time-frequency warping to Cohen 2 ̆ 7 s class. We can also derive the family of power classes PCκ, κ= 0, axiomatically by satisfying the scale and power <b>time-shift</b> covariance properties, or by using a power time-frequency warping of the affine class. We provide a formulation for both classes in terms of kernels, desirable QTFR properties and kernel constraints, and important QTFR members. We also study important subclasses with additional properties, simplified formulations and kernel constraints. The localized HC and localized PCκ satisfy a generalized time-frequency localization property. The HC-affine and HC-PCκ subclasses contain HC QTFRs that satisfy <b>time-shift</b> and power <b>time-shift</b> covariances, respectively, and the PCκ-affine subclasses contain <b>time-shift</b> covariant PCκ QTFRs. ^ HC QTFRs {{can be used for}} the detection and estimation of nonstationary signals in noise. We propose a time-frequency formulation for the optimum detection of Gaussian signals in white Gaussian noise based on HC QTFRs, and obtain simple statistics for hyperbolic impulses. We also propose a general class of HC QTFR receivers that (1) unifies classical detectors and (2) provides new, easy to implement structures in the time-frequency plane. We consider the parameter estimation of hyperbolic impulses using high signal-to-noise ratio techniques that result in accurate and fast estimates. We also generalize the estimation techniques to generalized impulse parameters. ...|$|R

500|$|Originally, Blow {{had envisioned}} {{the game to}} be broken into several {{different}} worlds as in the final game, each exploring facets of space, time, and causality, but with each world having very different high-level mechanics. One mechanic {{that he could not}} develop further was a world with no [...] "arrow of time" [...] that would have required the player to traverse the level in a manner that could be repeated in reverse. For example, the player would have been forbidden to jump down from a tall height while moving in forward time, as they {{would not be able to}} jump that height in reverse time. While this idea was not used, Blow discovered the rewind feature could be developed further for other aspects. Another game mechanic that Blow considered was to show the player the expected result of an action they would take; while this concept was informative, he did not find it to be an entertaining game mechanic. Blow had previously explored this in a prototype game called [...] "Oracle Billiards", the game predicting each billiards shot before it was made. He had found the billiards setting too chaotic for this idea and this led him to try out similar ideas in a simpler [...] "Mario-style" [...] setting. After selecting the game mechanics he wanted, he began adding puzzles that made philosophical points on his views on game design in general. After brainstorming more puzzles and concepts, Blow dropped the least interesting puzzles and worlds from the game. Blow wanted to include significant consequences of rewinding time, not found in games such as , , and Timeshift in which rewinding time creates few or no changes to the game's world. While these games immerse the player with these <b>time-shifting</b> effects using a first- or third-person perspective, he decided to use a 2D presentation. Blow noted that some of the puzzles in Braid would have been more difficult or impossible to solve in any other perspective.|$|E
