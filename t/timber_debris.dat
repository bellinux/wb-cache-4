50|$|The snag-clearance {{service was}} mainly {{important}} on the Fraser River {{because of the}} large amount of marine traffic. Passenger and freight-carrying sternwheelers operated out of New Westminster from 1859 until the early 1920s. These lightly built vessels were vulnerable to the woody debris and drift logs that would wash down the river with every spring freshet. After the 1920s, most of the traffic on the Fraser was tug and barge service along with deep sea shipping in the lower reaches of the river, and a greater portion of the snagboat's assignments was in maintenance of government docks and aids to navigation. In northern British Columbia, as on the Fraser River, {{a major part of the}} snagboat service provided by the Canadian federal government was in support of the gillnet salmon-fishing industry and the canneries that were built in and around the estuaries of the major rivers. Huge amounts of <b>timber</b> <b>debris</b> would wash down-river every year creating hazards for fishermen and destroying nets.|$|E

40|$|Torrentiotial rains in Fukui, July 2004 {{resulted}} in heavy damage to {{ground in the}} Asuwa river basin. This paper reports an outline of the matters and causes of the following damage: 1) The dike in the lower reaches of Asuwa river was breached in city area. A detailed survey was undertaken to determine why the dike was breached at that location. 2) Many cases of damage to revetments were observed in {{the upper reaches of}} Asuwa river and its tributary streams, and the damage was worsened by inundation resulting from <b>timber</b> <b>debris</b> and sedimentation. There were many cases of slope failure above revetments, which were thought to be due to scouring. 3) Many slope failures occurred at locations distant from rivers. In many cases they were relatively shallow collapses. 4) Many mud and debris flows occurred along small rivers or in mountain valleys, and large quantities of mud and timber were displaced. 5) At five steel bridges on the JR Line, bridge girders were washed away and bridge supports collapsed or were damaged. Considerable damage was caused to road bridges and to road and rail embankments. Our survey team carried out investigations into these 5 types of damage, to grasp {{the full extent of the}} damage and establish issues for future consideration...|$|E

40|$|Underwater {{acoustic}} imaging {{has emerged as}} a tremendous tool for hydraulic engineers and inspectors performing scour monitoring. This paper will discuss innovative methods for documenting scour and stream stability with “photographic quality” imaging below water. Underwater {{acoustic imaging}} can provide 2 -D and 3 -D visual images of channel bottom contours, waterway embankment slopes, undermined bridge foundations, and culverts potentially clogged with <b>timber</b> <b>debris</b> during flood events. Of the approximately 603, 000 bridges in the National Bridge Inventory (NBI), approximately 502, 000, or 83 %, are built over waterways. Additionally, there are literally millions of culverts that exist across the nation to maintain proper drainage under our vast highway system. When the scour potential is the greatest during a flood event, underwater acoustic imaging can provide underwater vision of existing submerged conditions. The light-weight reliable equipment can easily be used at a site via a boat or waterway crossing structure such as a bridge deck. IowaDOT is one of many state highway agencies that has utilized this technology during flood events to obtain timely hydraulic information. Every asset owner has the responsibility to monitor their assets {{to ensure the safety of}} the public during a flood. Since technology now allows visual documentation to be easily collected for inspection, design, and construction practices, owners can utilize underwater imaging to provide a greater level of reliability and safety. The new technology also provides more accurate measurements thereby reducing public inconvenience due to overly conservative bridge closures, reducing repair contractor risk of a previously unseen submerged site, and reducing project monitoring / repair costs for scour. This presentation will discuss how underwater imaging provides asset owners with new reliable method for collecting channel bottom data next to structures during floods, as well as how hydraulic engineers can benefit from the high definition images to monitor waterways and hydraulic control structures. Case studies will be discussed regarding the successful use of underwater acoustic imaging on waterways in the State of Iowa including Iowa STH 175 over the Missouri River (see attached images) and Interstate I- 29 over Horse Creek in Fremont County, Iowa...|$|E

25|$|While {{both areas}} are {{designated}} wilderness areas, Quetico Provincial Park is often {{considered to be}} more remote and challenging than the Boundary Waters. The Boundary Waters also receives far more visitors than the Quetico. It {{is not unusual for}} crews not to see another person for several days in the Quetico. Whereas the Boundary Waters' portage trails are generally well maintained, Quetico's trails are often unmaintained. This means that in Quetico there are no boardwalks as there are in the BWCAW for swampy portages, and there are fewer park wardens clearing the trails of fallen <b>timber</b> and <b>debris.</b>|$|R

The storm knocked down brick walls and flung signs, pieces of metal, wooden <b>timbers,</b> and other <b>debris</b> through the air and sometimes through buildings. Downtown was piled with rubble. The Nueces Hotel was deemed too badly damaged to be worth saving.|$|R
25|$|Without warning, {{there was}} a large {{deafening}} explosion at 3.25 p.m. just aft of the engine room where the whole after section or {{about a third of the}} vessel had disappeared and the vessel settling by the stern. The explosion resulted in <b>timber</b> and <b>debris</b> being shot into the air as well as oil from the fuel tanks spurted up like a geyser. Luckily the oil didn't catch fire. And seconds later the survivors found themselves in the calm sea struggling around grasping bundles of plywood six feet long and three feet wide which were scattered over a fairly wide expanse of sea. The bundles of plywood acted as life rafts as there had been no chance of even getting near the life-boats, let alone launching any of them. There had been no chance of sending out a wireless distress call.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. -Natural rates ofinput and {{depletion}} oflarge woody debris (LWD) {{in southeast}} Alaska streams were studied {{to provide a}} basis for managing streamside zones to maintain LWDfor fish habitat after <b>timber</b> harvest. <b>Debris</b> was inventoried in a variety of stream types in undisturbed old-growth forest; 252 pieces ofLWD were dated from the age of trees growing on them. Longevity of LWD was directly related to bole diameter: small LWD (10 - 30 cm in diameter) was less than 110 years old, whereas large LWD (> 60 cm in diameter) was up to 226 years old. Assuming equilibrium between input and depletion ofLWD in streams in old-growth forests and exponential decay ofLWD, we calculated input and depletion rates from mean age ofLWD. Input and depletion rates were inversely proportional to LWD diameter and ranged from 1 %/year for large LWD in all stream types to 3 %/year for small LWD in large, high-energy, bedrock-controlled streams. A model ofchanges in LWDafter timber harvest (which accounted for depletion of LWD and input from second-growth forest) indicated that 90 years after clear-cut logging without a stream-side buffer strip large LWD would be reduced by 70 % and recovery to prelogging levels would take more than 250 years. Because nearly all LWD is derived from within 30 m of the stream, the use of a 30 -m wide, unlogged buffer strip along both sides of the stream during timber harvest shoul...|$|R
40|$|Large woody debris (LWD), fine woody debris (FWD), fine organic debris (FOD), and {{sediment}} deposition were measured in 15 steep headwater streams with five management and disturbance regimes. Clear-cut channels logged in 1995 contained large accumulations of logging residue that initially provided sites for sediment storage. Half of the LWD in clear-cut channels was recruited during {{and immediately after}} logging. Woody debris from logging activities remains in young growth conifer channels 37 years after logging. Numbers of LWD in clear-cut and young conifer channels {{were significantly higher than}} in old-growth channels, although numbers of FWD pieces were not significantly different because of higher recruitment from old-growth stands. Channels that experienced recent (1979 and (or) 1993) and earlier (1961 and (or) 1979) scour and runout of landslides and debris flows contained less LWD and FWD, although large volumes of LWD and FWD were found in deposition zones. The volumes of sediment stored in young alder and recent landslide channels were higher than in the other channels. Because of the recruitment of LWD and FWD from young alder stands, the ratio of sediment stored behind woody debris to total sediment volume was higher in young alder channels compared with recent landslide channels. Numbers of LWD and FWD pieces in all streams were significantly correlated with the volumes of sediment stored behind woody <b>debris.</b> <b>Timber</b> harvesting and soil mass movement influence the recruitment, distribution, and accumulation of woody debris in headwater streams; this modifies sediment storage and transport in headwater channels...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} species in northeastern forest ecosystems is the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Browsing by these herbivores can influence patterns of forest regeneration following a <b>timber</b> harvest. Logging <b>debris,</b> or ?slash?, has the potential to inhibit deer browsing and enhance forest regeneration in a cutover area. At two heavily logged sites in the Arnot Forest, NY, study plots containing experimental seedlings and natural vegetation were created in May 2004 and monitored thru November 2006. Each plot received one of three treatments: open - cleared of logging debris; tops ? tree tops and debris-covered; or fenced - cleared of debris and fenced to exclude deer. Levels of deer browsing in experimental seedlings and natural vegetation, tree seedling growth, and natural vegetation richness, were compared among these treatments. We found significantly higher deer browsing on experimental seedlings (p =. 0053) and palatable herbaceous vegetation (p =. 0094) in open plots, than tops-covered or fenced plots. Cumulative deer browsing negatively correlated with mean experimental seedling height at the plot level (p =. 0296), resulting in higher black cherry (Prunus serotina) seedling growth in protected fenced and tops treatments. Additionally, logging debris was found to benefit common management objectives, such as herb richness and relative abundance of desirable timber tree seedlings. We conclude that logging debris left in place after a forest thinning can effectively inhibit deer browsing and promote forest regeneration. The degree of protection afforded by tree tops was intermediate between unprotected and fenced areas. The minimal effort and cost associated with this technique would make it highly preferable to constructing fences to improve regeneration. As white-tailed deer become increasingly overabundant, alternative options for the sustainable regeneration of forests are necessary; the post-harvest retention of logging debris in situ provides such an alternative...|$|R
