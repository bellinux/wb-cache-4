But even among her feminist activist colleagues she felt isolated, {{because she was the}} only black woman there. She had never met another black German, and from her years in the children's home she had learned to think of blacks (including herself) as inferior and immoral. Years later she commented that [...] "the most disastrous <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> at the home was self-hatred." [...] In 1986, she attended a meeting of Afro-Germans; she was 39 years old {{and it was the first}} time she had ever seen [...] "a black face that wasn't my own." [...] She was empowered by the sense of community and became an activist for Afro-Germans, studying their history and asserting their legitimacy in a society that still assumed that all Germans must be white.|$|E
500|$|After being {{attacked}} by the crows, Homer is seen being treated by Dr. Hibbert at the Springfield General Hospital. While there are no visible scars on him, the character instead has a slightly curled hair. During a color screening of the scene, Homer's body looked [...] "a little too bloody" [...] and damaged, prompting the staff to change it. [...] "One <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> {{a long time ago}} is, you gotta be careful how you change [...] basic model pack", Jean said in the episode's DVD commentary. He also said that he was happy that many viewers identify with the characters and don't want to see them get hurt or injured in any way. [...] "They don't mind if [...] falls down a cliff but [...] he should recover." [...] While working on the episode, the series' staff debated what size to make Homer's pupils when he is under the influence of marijuana. Because a common effect of smoking marijuana is to get dilated pupils, the animators initially suggested to widen them, but settled on only dilating Homer's pupils slightly.|$|E

2500|$|Using the Tralfamadorian {{passivity}} of fate, Billy Pilgrim {{learns to}} overlook {{death and the}} shock involved with death. Pilgrim claims the Tralfamadorian philosophy on death to be his most important lesson:The most important <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He {{is still very much}} alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist. [...] When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is [...] "So it goes."Billy Pilgrim continues throughout the novel to use the term [...] "so it goes" [...] as it relates to death. The ideas behind death, fate, time, and free will are drastically different when compared to those of Christianity.|$|E

60|$|Let me say {{also that}} when I speak of {{coeducation}} I speak of what I know. I was coeducated myself some thirty-five years ago, {{at the very}} beginning of the <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> my Greek alongside of a bevy of beauty on the opposite benches that mashed up the irregular verbs for us very badly. Incidentally, those girls are all married long since, and all the Greek they know now you could put under a thimble. But of that presently.|$|E
60|$|I suppose, {{really to}} enjoy such pomp and luxury, {{one should be}} {{positively}} born in the purple; and then, I suppose, one must be careful that the dye does {{not go to the}} bone. Whether or not, I have long since {{come to the conclusion that}} I am vulgar by nature--like my mother tongue. And at times, in spite of my relief at being free of the blackness that had craped in my last days at Beechwood, I often found myself hungering for my Bowater parlour--even for its smell. Another <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> gradually at No. 2 was that I had been desperately old-fashioned; and that is, to some extent, to belong to the dead.|$|E
60|$|This put {{it beyond}} {{a doubt that}} she was partly {{informed}} of my story and peril. How, or just how much, it was more difficult to guess. It was plain she {{knew there was something}} of danger in the name of Alan, and thus warned me to leave it out of reference; and plain she knew that I stood under some criminal suspicion. I judged besides that the harshness of her last speech (which besides she had followed up immediately with a very noisy piece of music) was {{to put an end to}} the present conversation. I stood beside her, affecting to listen and admire, but truly whirled away by my own thoughts. I have always found this young lady to be a lover of the mysterious; and certainly this first interview made a mystery that was beyond my plummet. One <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> long after, the hours of the Sunday had been well employed, the bank porter had been found and examined, my visit to Charles Stewart was discovered, and the deduction made that I was pretty deep with James and Alan, and most likely in a continued correspondence with the last. Hence this broad hint that was given me across the harpsichord.|$|E

60|$|We three, however (almost {{complete}} {{strangers to}} each other), had assumed attitudes of serious amiability round our table. A waiter approached for orders {{and it was}} then, in relation to my order for coffee, that the absolutely first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> of Captain Blunt {{was the fact that}} he was a sufferer from insomnia. In his immovable way Mills began charging his pipe. I felt extremely embarrassed all at once, but became positively annoyed when I saw our Prax enter the café in a sort of mediaeval costume very much like what Faust wears in the third act. I have no doubt it was meant for a purely operatic Faust. A light mantle floated from his shoulders. He strode theatrically up to our table and addressing me as “Young Ulysses” proposed I should go outside on the fields of asphalt and help him gather a few marguerites to decorate a truly infernal supper which was being organized across the road at the Maison Dorée—upstairs. With expostulatory shakes of the head and indignant glances I called his attention to the fact that I was not alone. He stepped back a pace as if astonished by the discovery, took off his plumed velvet toque with a low obeisance so that the feathers swept the floor, and swaggered off the stage with his left hand resting on the hilt of the property dagger at his belt.|$|E

I believe {{sometimes}} also in butter, and, when I can get it, in new wine, particularly the rough sort; but, above all, I believe in wine that's good and old. Mahomet's prohibition of it is all moonshine. I am the son, you must know, of a Greek nun and a Turkish bishop; and the first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> was to play the fiddle. I used to sing Homer to it. I was then concerned in a brawl in a mosque, in which the old bishop somehow happened to be killed; so I tied a sword to my side, and went to seek my fortune, accompanied by all the possible sins of Turk and Greek. People talk of the seven deadly sins; but I have seventy-seven that never quit me, summer or winter; by which you may judge {{of the amount of}} my venial ones. I am a gambler, a cheat, a ruffian, a highwayman, a pick-pocket, a glutton (at beef or blows); have no shame whatever; love to let every body know what I can do; lie, besides, about what I can't do; have a particular attachment to sacrilege; swallow perjuries like figs; never give a farthing to any body, but beg of every body, and abuse them into the bargain; look upon not spilling a drop of liquor as the chief of all the cardinal virtues; but must own I am not much given to assassination, murder being inconvenient; and one thing I am bound to acknowledge, which is, that I never betrayed a messmate." ...|$|E
