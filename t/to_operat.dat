40|$|A {{calculus}} {{for developing}} programs from specifications written as predicates that describe {{the relationship between}} the initial and final state is proposed. Such specifications are well known from the specification language Z. All elements of a simple sequential programming notation are defined in terms of predicates. Hence programs form a subset of specifications. In particular, sequential composition is defined by 'demonic composition', nondeterministic choice by 'demonic disjunction', and iteration by fixed points. Laws are derived which allow proving equivalence and refinement of specifications and programs. The weakest precondition is expressed by sequential composition. The approach is compared to the predicative programming approach of E. Hehner and to other refinement calculi. 1 Introduction We view a specification as a predicate which describes the admissible final state of a computing machine with respect to some initial state. A program is a predicate restricted <b>to</b> <b>operat</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|When {{operating}} systems and hardware manage power and energy, {{they must be}} conservative in order to deliver re-quested resources while maintaining an expected rate of system throughput. Application-level energy management is more flexible, because applications can choose to request fewer resources or expect less performance, effectively trad-ing accuracy or runtime for power. We propose to leverage this flexibility with energy exchanges, a C++ library exten-sion that allows software to dynamically react to measured power and energy use by reducing functionality. 1.

40|$|We {{address the}} area of {{scheduling}} and {{the differences between the}} way operations research and artificial intelligence approach scheduling. We introduce the concept of constraint programming, and describe how operations research techniques can be integrated in constraint programming. Finally, we give a short overview of the results obtained with our approach. 1 Introduction Baker [1974] defines scheduling as the problem of allocating scarce resources to activities over time. Scheduling problems arise in areas as diverse as production planning, personnel planning, computer design, and time tabling. Over the years, the theory and application of scheduling has grown into an important field of research, and an extensive body of literature exists on the subject. For more elaborate introductions to the theory of scheduling, we refer to [Baker, 1974], [Coffman, 1976] and [French, 1982]. Roughly speaking, we can distinguish two fields of research that pay attention <b>to</b> scheduling, viz., <b>operat</b> [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Building energy {{simulation}} {{plays an}} important role in decision makings involving energy conservation measures and choices of renewable energy systems in building designs. Traditional simulation tools rely on weather data sets called Typical Meteorological Year (TMY), representing a typical year of weather at ground weather stations throughout the United States. These data sets are constructed using an algorithm to select the “most typical” month of the many years in the database for each month. Some recent publications suggest that one-year TMY data is no longer sufficient to evaluate long-term performance of PV systems, because a typical year does not taken into account extreme weather, and thus does not address the meteorological uncertainty that might occur. Actual electricity outputs from photovoltaic systems vary from year to year. Having more accurate information about production performance should help facilitate system selections that match building designs and how <b>to</b> <b>operat...</b>|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} symptomatic and asymptomatic herniated discs and root compression in patients with lumbosacral radicular syndrome (LRS) and to correlate clinical localization with MRI findings. METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with unilateral LRS {{were included in the}} study. Using the visual analogue scale, two physicians independently localized the most likely lumbar level of complaints. These clinical predictions of localizations were correlated with the MRI findings. RESULTS: MRI showed abnormalities on the symptomatic side in 42 of 57 patients (74 %). In 30 % of the patients, MRI confirmed an abnormality at the exact same level as determined after clinical examination. On the asymptomatic side, MRI showed abnormalities in 19 of 57 patients (33 %), 13 (23 %) of these patients had asymptomatic root compression. CONCLUSIONS: In {{more than two-thirds of the}} patients with unilateral LRS there was no exact match between the level predicted by clinical examination and MRI findings.

40|$|B-trees with relaxed balance {{have been}} defined to {{facilitate}} fast updating on shared-memory asynchronous parallel architectures. To obtain this, rebalancing has been uncoupled from the updating such that extensive locking {{can be avoided}} in connection with updates. We analyze B-trees with relaxed balance, and prove that each update gives rise to at most blog a (N= 2) c + 1 rebalancing operations, where a is the degree of the Btree, and N is the bound on its maximal size since it was last in balance. Assuming {{that the size of}} nodes are at least twice the degree, we prove that rebalancing can be performed in amortized constant time. So, in the long run, rebalancing is constant time on average, even if any particular update could give rise to logarithmic time rebalancing. We also prove that the amount of rebalancing done at any particular level decreases exponentially going from the leaves towards the root.

40|$|What is the {{connection}} between computers, multiple modalities and people with disabilities? A traditionally scientific chapter might start out with definitions of these terms. However, there is problem in doing that in this case, which is that {{only one of them}} – ‘computer ’ – is at all easy to define. Daily activities of people take the form of interactions between them and their environment (where ‘environment ’ is meant in a broad sense, encompassing other people as well as the physical surroundings). These interactions occur through an ‘interface ’ which uses the physical, cognitive and sensory functions of the person. If any of those functions is impaired {{to the extent that the}} person finds forms of interaction difficult or impossible, then that person is said to be disabled (UN, 1981). The degree to which that disability handicaps the person depends on the extent to which the impaired function can be supported or substituted. Before the discussion becomes too abstract, let us consider some examples. A person with a hearing impairment has difficulty interacting with the auditory component of the environment.

40|$|A recent {{analysis}} of {{southern bluefin tuna}} otoliths presented by Kalish and Johnston indicates that {{a high proportion of}} the large southern bluefin tuna caught during recent years would be very old, between 15 and 30 years. This result is in contradiction with all results presently obtained from the virtual population analysis. The present paper develops a simulation model assuming an underlying population with a fraction of stock which remain partly unavailable to the fisheries. This simple concept and model could easily explain the abundance of very old southern bluefin tuna in the recent catches. This hypothesis of a cryptic biomass may be a realistic one, because of the large area inhabited by the species, because of the present closure of the spawning area to all fisheries and because of the low catch quota which limits the fisheries <b>to</b> <b>operat</b> in the areas of highest tuna densities. This cryptic biomass could introduce significant potential bias in the results obtained from the virtual population analysis, at least for the stocks heavily exploited.

40|$|Under the Barnett formula the UK's {{peripheral}} sub-nations receive {{considerably more}} in public expenditure per head {{than is the}} case in England. Whilst relative need indices provide some justification for this in the case of Northern Ireland {{and to a lesser extent}} Wales, Scotland as a whole benefits very substantially in comparison with the three regions of the North of England- North East, North West, and Yorkshire and Humberside which together have more than three times Scotland's population and are substantially more deprived in total on need indicators. These issues are now on the political agenda as was demonstrated in a House of Commons debate initiated by Graham Stringer, a Manchester MP, in November 2007. The interesting question is who benefits from this comparative largesse towards Scotland? There is clear evidence that the primary beneficiaries in Scotland are middle and higher income households who have access to better health care, free social care, and free higher education. This paper will review the relationship between need indices and resource allocation across English regions, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and then examine available spatial and social structural data on public expenditure to explore just who in Scotland actually benefits from the resource allocation imbalance. The history of this issue goes back to 1888 when the George Goschen introduced a resource allocation formula which gave 80 % of the revenue support grant to local authorities to England and Wales, 11 % to Scotland and 9 % to Ireland.

40|$|The {{main reason}} that {{explains}} the structure of this thesis is simple: the personal archive af {{one of the most}} important architects of Latin America, with works by over half a million square meters, has been lost almost entirely. The historical error that would have meant to lose a material with extraordinary value, not only for Uruguay, but for anyone with an interest in architecture, is what this thesis attempts to rectify, if only partially. Recovering from the past the architectural heritage which represents a substantial part of the cultural identity of the country, and make it available at present, has been the crucial objective of these years of research. The value of the thesis is essentially graphic and, conceptual scaffolds, are just footnotes that collaborate in the structuring and presentation of the first. The main motivation was to try to explain the high quality that have reached several urban areas in Uruguay, formed exclusively, or mostly, by modern architecture. Assumed the decline of the archive, we decided to choose one of its most important buildings and face its graphic reconstruction, based on current and vintage photographs, old photographs of models and site surveys. The "Ciudadela" was selected, at first, because it is considered as one of the buildings with higher design quality in Montevideo. However, I realized that an invaluable resource could be included, that any archive would be able to equal: the commitment of the author of the work, Raul Sichero, to accompany me during graphic reconstruction, from the beginning. The idea of starting this project from the initial premises of the author, without untestable hypotheses, was what led me to extend the thesis to other works. Sichero not only accepted the proposal, but intensified the inltial timetable than we had provided. Sichero's participation was not reduced to visit, review and re-design his buildings, but also has modified subtly some features that did not completely convinced him in the ¡nitial project. This thesis is therefore - besides the reconstruction of a sustancial part of the missing file of an architect who is essential to understand the history of domest¡c architecture Uruguay - the reelaboration of a piece of his work, with graphic tools that allowed him to transform some of its projects and, in some cases, to propose an improved alternative. Consequently, this work was no longer an unfeasible task of collecting historical data, to become its opposite: the active reelaboration, together with the author, of a lost graphic archive, starting from the finished work. On some occasions Sichero studied alternative solutions for his projects, which converged in several lines of formal evolution. The analysis of some versions developed simultaneously with the built version, serves to illustrate the fundamental determinations that structured the final proposals. Even though the fact that it was essential to have the main author of the buidings in Uruguay, close to the investigation, the arguments for increasing the graphic archive were clear. It was, therefore, necessary to travel to Buenos Aires, to Mario Roberto Alvarez 's office, with the aim of expanding the information of several buildings, which had been produced in partnership, in Punta del Este. The thesis will pivot, in summary, around buildings or projects that have been reconstructed in graphic terms, and has been extended to those that were documented only through vintage photographs or by others taken by the author. What constitutes the core of the research, is profusely detailed in graphic terms and commented, on a subsidiary basis, under the logic in which they were treated by the architect, avoiding the distortion of the conceptual center of his thoughts. These always serve visual reasons, supported with technical arguments, that conclude in the specific building, bul also in the gradual construction of the clties in which was able <b>to</b> <b>operat...</b>|$|E
