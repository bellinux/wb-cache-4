5|$|In April, Austrian forces {{approached}} Mantua {{and started}} their siege. At first, the Austrians were content to simply blockade the fortress, {{but with the}} artillery duels and occasional skirmishes, attrition began <b>taking</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on the defenders. The defenders were also weakened by diminishing food supplies, and their morale was undermined by lack of payment.|$|E
5|$|Woods' {{performance}} {{continued to}} suffer in 2011, <b>taking</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on his ranking. After falling to No. 7 in March, he rebounded to No. 5 {{with a strong}} showing at the 2011 Masters Tournament, where he tied for fourth place. Due to leg injuries incurred at the Masters, he missed several summer stops on the PGA Tour. In July, he fired his longtime caddy Steve Williams (who {{was shocked by the}} dismissal), and replaced him on an interim basis with friend Bryon Bell. After returning to tournament play in August, Woods continued to falter, and his ranking gradually fell to a low of #58. He rose to No. 50 in mid-November after a third-place finish at the Emirates Australian Open, and broke his winless streak with a victory at December's Chevron World Challenge.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} moved northward over the Yellow Sea, {{atmospheric}} conditions became increasingly hostile, with significantly lower sea surface temperatures and high wind shear. During the overnight of August2728, the typhoon brushed South Korea as a weakening cyclone. Convection {{on the west}} side of the storm diminished and its feeder bands began to collapse. Increasing shear started <b>taking</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> early on August28 as convection became displaced from the center of circulation, leaving part of the southwestern quadrant exposed. This also indicated that Bolaven had begun to undergo an extratropical transition as it approached the Korean Peninsula. Following structural weakening, the JMA and JTWC downgraded Bolaven to a severe tropical storm and tropical storm, respectively. Hours before moving onshore in North Korea, the majority of the convection had moved over land while the circulation and the center itself had only stratocumulus clouds covering it. Around 1500UTC on August28, Bolaven made landfall in North Korea with winds of 100km/h (65mph). Rapidly moving towards the northeast, the storm became fully embedded within a baroclinic zone near the ChinaNorth Korea border later that day. The JMA continued to monitor Bolaven as a tropical cyclone until early on August29, at which time the system was situated over the southern region of the Russian Far East. The extratropical remnants later turned eastward and were last noted on September1 crossing the International Dateline.|$|E
5000|$|Among other {{initiatives}} {{the group}} has pursued was {{the purchase of the}} Douglas Street Bridge (the first road bridge across the Missouri River) in hopes of <b>taking</b> <b>its</b> <b>tolls</b> off (the bridge was renamed the Ak-Sar-Ben Bridge). From the 1920s through the 1990s, the Knights built and operated a horse racing track and arena complex, also named Ak-Sar-Ben. In 1992 the Knights donated the horse racing track and arena complex to a new legal entity [...] - [...] the Ak-Sar-Ben Future Trust. This organization is developing the property for multi-purpose under the name Aksarben Village,.|$|R
5000|$|The {{decade of}} the 1990s began with an {{economic}} recession, <b>taking</b> <b>its</b> inevitable <b>toll</b> on the automotive industry, and throwing GM into some of its worst losses. As a result, [...] "Jack" [...] Smith (not related to Roger) became burdened {{with the task of}} overseeing a radical restructuring of General Motors. Sharing Roger's understanding of the need for serious change, Jack undertook many major revisions. Reorganizing the management structure to dismantle the legacy of Alfred P. Sloan, instituting deep cost-cutting and introducing significantly improved vehicles were the key approaches. These moves were met with much less resistance within GM than had Roger's similar initiatives as GM management ranks were stinging from their recent near-bankruptcy experience and were much more willing to accept the prospect of radical change.|$|R
2500|$|After that assault, Henry took {{account of}} the desperate {{conditions}} in the Portuguese camp. [...] The army was starving, horses and beasts of burden were eaten. Thirst also began <b>taking</b> <b>its</b> deadly <b>toll</b> – the siege camp contained but a single small well, sufficient to slake only about one hundred men per day. [...] With so many wounded and weakened, Henry {{did not have enough}} men to garrison the full length of the stockade. [...] With the tacit permission of the Moroccan leaders, in an overnight operation on Saturday evening, Henry had his men reduce the circumference of the siege camp (and shift it slightly closer to the sea), allowing the Portuguese to defend themselves more effectively against renegade skirmishers. There were no more assaults on the Portuguese siege camp. [...] The truce was observed from Sunday, October 13 onwards.|$|R
5|$|Audrey and David begin feuding {{over the}} rights to the salon and Lewis notices that the arguing is <b>taking</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on Audrey's health. He {{suggests}} they go to Wales for a few days instead. When Audrey serves David with an injunction to try and reclaim her business, an argument breaks out and Audrey suffers a heart attack. Lewis comforts Audrey until the ambulance arrives and stays with her at the hospital. Lewis and Audrey go on holiday. On her return, Audrey reveals to her family that Lewis disappeared from the Eurostar on the way home. Lewis later turns up at the salon to see Audrey and explains that he disappeared because he saw Penny Thornley (Susan Hanson), a woman he once conned. Lewis asks Audrey to run away with him and she agrees. While they are packing, Audrey's family and Penny arrive. Penny reveals that she is going to call the police, but Audrey stops her and gives her the money Lewis took. When Nick refuses to give Lewis his job back, Gloria Price (Sue Johnston) hires him to work at The Rovers Return.|$|E
5|$|French {{fire was}} <b>taking</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on the British ship, and at 22:20, Amethysts {{mizzenmast}} was shot through and {{collapsed on the}} quarterdeck, smashing the wheel and impeding Seymour's command of his ship. Thétis began to pull ahead and Pinsum attempted to rake Amethyst in her disorganised state, turning sharply to starboard but coming to a sudden halt as her own mizzenmast collapsed. With their ability to manoeuvre severely hindered, Amethyst and Thétis gradually closed on one another, Pinsum ordering the soldiers on his frigate to board the British vessel and capture her, while Seymour prepared for the eventuality by loading his cannon with two roundshot and his carronades with double loads of grapeshot. At 23:00, Pinsum suddenly swung his frigate towards Amethyst, the bows colliding and rebounding and the French stern swinging towards the British. At his signal, the soldiers and sailors crowded onto the deck and railings, ready to leap onto the British ship and engage her crew in hand-to-hand combat. With seconds remaining, Seymour ordered his gunners to fire. The double-shotted broadside, fired at point-blank range, killed or wounded over 100 men, including most of the officers. Only four guns were still serviceable on Thétis, which was set alight in three places due to {{the proximity of the}} British muzzle flashes.|$|E

25|$|By 1978, age was <b>taking</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on the Vikings, {{but they}} still made the playoffs with an 8–7–1 record. There was no more playoff magic as the Rams finally {{defeated}} the Vikings, 34–10 in Los Angeles after having lost in their previous four playoff matchups (in 1969, '74, '76 and '77). Quarterback Fran Tarkenton retired following the season holding league passer records in attempts (6,467), completions (3,686), yards (47,003), and touchdowns (342).|$|E
25|$|Middlesbrough next visited Stoke City's Britannia Stadium {{in another}} {{important}} game. Like {{much of the}} season, the team once again failed to score. As expected, Rory Delap's throw-in's were Stoke's main offensive weapon. Although they dealt with most of them well, Ryan Shawcross headed one home on 84 minutes, giving them a vital 1–0 win over their relegation rivals. The loss left Middlesbrough four points from safety, with the battle against relegation <b>taking</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on the club's morale.|$|E

Saints re-open on 25 December 1918 and are beaten 20 points to nil by St Helens Recs in a friendly fixture at City Road. In the shortened 1918—1919 season, St Helens played only nine times. The clubs lack of success and disappointing league finishes continued for another seven seasons.|$|E
25|$|The {{formaldehyde}} {{surrounding the}} shark, Hirst says, {{is the process}} of death and decay. Though formaldehyde is used as a preservation means, over time, the object being preserved will soon wilt, flake, and wrinkle. Because the sculpture itself was made in 1991, the shark is very much rotting and deformed due to the formaldehyde <b>taking</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on the corpse. With the corpse rotting away, it symbolizes that no matter how well we take care of ourselves or how timeless we think we are, our mind will start to fade away and we slowly will begin to forget.|$|E

Instead, Aldikacti was forced to settle for the already manufactured four-cylinder engine GM produced for the Pontiac, the “Iron Duke,” nicknamed for its heavy iron block. This engine was too blocky to fit into the tiny car so it was equipped with a smaller oil pan, causing the engine to always run a quart low.|$|E

The only safe place in the fort was a ditch on the east side and Fleury would go there to round up men for work details, lashing out at the laggards with his cane. The next in command after Smith was Lieutenant Colonel Giles Russell of Connecticut, but he declined and asked to be recalled. On November 12 Major Thayer accepted command of the fort.|$|E

25|$|After Independence, the {{province}} of Guanajuato was made a state, and the city was made its capital in 1824. However, fighting {{in the state and}} the rest of the country continued as Liberals, who wanted a Federalist government, fought with Conservatives, who wanted a centralized government under a monarch or dictator. Power in the city and state changed hands between the two factions during much of the 19th century, <b>taking</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on mining. The city was the provisional capital of the country in 1858 as Liberal president Benito Juárez fought Conservative rebels. In 1863, the French took the city during the French Intervention in Mexico, receiving a visit from the installed Emperor Maximiliano I and his wife, Carlota. French occupation ended in 1868, when the newly assimilated Mexican General Florencio Antillón captured it on 26 January.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the hope}} that mental illness could be {{ameliorated}} through treatment during the mid-19th century was disappointed. Instead, psychiatrists were pressured by an ever-increasing patient population. The average number of patients in asylums in the United States jumped 927%. Numbers were similar in Britain and Germany. Overcrowding was rampant in France where asylums would commonly take in double their maximum capacity. Increases in asylum populations {{may have been a}} result of the transfer of care from families and poorhouses, but the specific reasons as to why the increase occurred is still debated today. No matter the cause, the pressure on asylums from the increase was <b>taking</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on the asylums and psychiatry as a specialty. Asylums were once again turning into custodial institutions and the reputation of psychiatry in the medical world had hit an extreme low.|$|E
25|$|The Turkish mounted archers {{attacked}} in their usual style - charging in, shooting their arrows, and quickly retreating before the crusaders could counterattack. The archers did little {{damage to the}} heavily armoured knights, but they inflicted heavy casualties on the horses and unarmoured foot soldiers. Bohemond had sent messengers to the other Crusader army and now struggled to hold on until help arrived, and his army was being forced back to {{the bank of the}} Thymbris river. The marshy riverbanks protected the crusaders from mounted charge, as the ground was too soft for horses, and the armoured knights formed a circle protecting the foot soldiers and noncombatants from arrows, but the Turks kept their archers constantly supplied and the sheer number of arrows was <b>taking</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll,</b> reportedly more than 2,000 falling to horse-archers. Bohemond's knights were impetuous - although ordered to stand ground, small groups of knights would periodically break ranks and charge, only to be slaughtered or forced back as the Turkish horses fell back beyond range of their swords and arrows, while still shooting at them with arrows, killing many of the knights' horses out from under them. And although the knights' armour protected them well (the Turks called them 'men of iron') the sheer number of arrows meant that some would find unprotected spots and eventually, after so many hits, a knight would collapse from his wounds.|$|E
