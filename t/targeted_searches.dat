500|$|Smith then {{proceeds}} to discuss {{each of the}} six themes in detail. Smith discusses modern guerrilla and insurgency campaigns, including various civil wars and ethnic conflicts in the Balkans, the Middle East, and Africa. The conflicts he discusses in the second half are almost all [...] "wars amongst the people" [...] and appear intractable to conventional forces. Smith analyses situations in which countries have adapted their tactics in order to respond to [...] "war amongst the people", such as those used by Israeli forces in response to the Palestinian Intifada, in which the Israelis resorted to <b>targeted</b> <b>searches</b> when superior firepower proved ineffective. He points out that modern wars are rarely fought between individual nations, but the parties often consist of supranational coalitions or sub-state entities, and that Western governments in particular fight {{in such a way as}} to keep casualties and material losses to a minimum. Smith is critical of the conduct of the American-led coalition in the Iraq War during the insurgency which followed the initial invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003; he opines that the soldiers undertaking the counter-insurgency operations did not have the proper skills or equipment for the task. He believes that the commanders were working at a tactical rather than a strategic level, and that operations were not sufficiently guided by intelligence—relying too heavily on battlefield strength and assessments of the insurgents' technical capabilities, rather than their political objectives.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Targeted</b> <b>Search</b> Element (TSE) {{performs}} {{one of two}} complimentary search {{strategies of}} the NASA-SETI Microwave Observing Project (MOP) : the <b>targeted</b> <b>search.</b> The principle objective of the <b>targeted</b> <b>search</b> strategy is to scan the microwave window between the frequencies of one and three gigahertz for narrowband microwave emissions eminating {{from the direction of}} 773 specifically targeted stars. The scanning process is accomplished at a minimum resolution of one or two Hertz at very high sensitivity. Detectable signals will be of a continuous wave or pulsed form and may also drift in frequency. The TSE will possess extensive radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation and verification capability as the majority of signals detected by the TSE will be of local origin. Any signal passing through RFI classification and classifiable as an extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) candidate will be further validated at non-MOP observatories using established protocol. The <b>targeted</b> <b>search</b> will be conducted using the capability provided by the TSE. The TSE provides six <b>Targeted</b> <b>Search</b> Systems (TSS) which independently or cooperatively perform automated collection, analysis, storage, and archive of signal data. Data is collected in 10 megahertz chunks and signal processing is performed at a rate of 160 megabits per second.

50|$|As with MIAs {{from the}} First World War, it is a routine {{occurrence}} for {{the remains of}} missing personnel killed during the Second World War to be periodically discovered.

However, sometimes the numbers in a group are considerably larger e.g. the mass grave at Villeneuve-Loubet, which contained the remains of 14 German soldiers killed in August 1944. Others are located at remote aircraft crash sites in various countries.But in eastern Europe and Russia, World War II casualties include approximately two million missing Germans, and many mass graves remain to be found. Almost a half million German MIAs have been buried in new graves {{since the end of}} the Cold War. Most of them will stay unknown. The German War Graves Commission is spearheading the effort.

5000|$|In {{the final}} {{third of the}} book, Smith uses six themes to {{describe}} the new paradigm of war:*The ends for which we fight are changing from the hard objectives that decide a political outcome to those of establishing conditions in which the outcome may be decided *We fight amongst the people, not on the battlefield *Our conflicts tend to be timeless, even unending *We fight so as to preserve the force rather than risking all to gain the objective *On each occasion new uses are found for old weapons and organizations which are the products of industrial war*The sides are mostly non-state, comprising some form of multinational grouping against some non-state party or parties.Smith then proceeds to discuss {{each of the six}} themes in detail. Smith discusses modern guerrilla and insurgency campaigns, including various civil wars and ethnic conflicts in the Balkans, the Middle East, and Africa. The conflicts he discusses in the second half are almost all [...] "wars amongst the people" [...] and appear intractable to conventional forces.

Project Phoenix, under the direction of Jill Tarter, is a continuation of the targeted search program from MOP and studies roughly 1,000 nearby Sun-like stars. From 1995 through March 2004, Phoenix conducted observations at the 64 m Parkes radio telescope in Australia, the 140 ft radio telescope of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, and the 1000 ft radio telescope at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The project observed the equivalent of 800 stars over the available channels in the frequency range from 1200 to 3000 MHz. The search was sensitive enough to pick up transmitters with 1 GW EIRP to a distance of about 200 light-years. According to Prof. Tarter, in 2012 it costs around [...] "$2 million per year to keep SETI research going at the SETI Institute" [...] and approximately 10 times that to support [...] "all kinds of SETI activity around the world." ...|$|E
