25|$|In the classrooms, {{the highest}} {{priorities}} were piety, orthodoxy, and strict discipline. Knowledge {{of the subject}} matter was a minor concern, and in the late 19th century few of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> parochial (or secular) schools had gone beyond the 8th grade themselves. The sisters came from numerous denominations, and there was no effort to provide joint teachers training programs. The bishops were indifferent. Finally around 1911, led by the Catholic University in Washington, Catholic colleges began summer institutes to train the sisters in pedagogical techniques. Long past World War II, the Catholic schools were noted for inferior plants compared to the public schools, and less well-trained teachers. The teachers were selected for religiosity, not teaching skills; the outcome was pious children and a reduced risk of marriage to Protestants.|$|E

2500|$|After the Nazi {{takeover}} in Germany the new Reich's government streamlined {{foreign policy}} according to Nazi ideals, using financial pressure especially.

2500|$|Kugler was {{a leader}} {{among a group of}} AFT delegates who sought to force the {{national}} union to end its practice of chartering segregated locals. The union had amended its constitution in 1953 to bar segregated locals, but had done little to enforce the provision. [...] In 1954, Kugler and others demanded that the union suspend the charters of locals that barred black teachers from membership. Although a resolution passed, president Carl J. Megel and other national union officers argued that the resolution and constitution provision did not [...] "require" [...] suspension. The following year, Kugler led the anti-segregation forces in yet another resolution battle, which led to passage of a policy which unequivocably required ejection of locals which discriminated on the basis of race. A number of locals in the Deep South withdrew from the union rather than be suspended, including Local 89 in Atlanta (the first AFT local where 100 percent of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> the bargaining unit had joined the local).

2500|$|A year later, the Florida Supreme Court {{ruled that}} {{teachers}} had {{a constitutional right}} to bargain collectively. In 1968, two newly employed teachers and the Dade County Education Association, Local 1875, AFT, sued the Board of Public Instruction of Dade County and DCCTA. [...] In an ironic twist, AFT argued that the school board's collective bargaining relationship with DCCTA was unconstitutional under Florida's constitution. The AFT's strategy was to break DCCTA's collective bargaining relationship, then organize <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> Dade County itself. [...] But after the lawsuit had been filed, Florida voters in November 1968 approved a new state constitution. In mid-1969, the Florida Supreme Court held in Dade County Classroom Teachers Association v. Ryan, 225 So. 2d 903 (July 9, 1969), that both the old and new Florida constitutions gave all employees—whether employed in the public or private sector—the right to bargain collectively. The court did not hold that public employees had the right to strike or that the state had a duty bargain with its employees or their organization, but the mere affirmation of public-sector collective bargaining rights was a major victory for FEA.|$|E
2500|$|When {{her husband}} Francis II died in 1560, Mary, now 19, elected {{to return to}} Scotland {{to take up the}} government. She gained an {{agreement}} that she would be the only person to legally partake in Catholic services and did not attempt to re-impose Catholicism on her subjects, thus angering the chief Catholic nobles. Her six-year personal reign was marred by a series of crises, largely caused by the intrigues and rivalries of the leading nobles. The murder of her secretary, David Riccio, was followed by that of her unpopular second husband Lord Darnley, father of her infant son, and her abduction by, and marriage to, the Earl of Bothwell, who was implicated in Darnley's murder. Opposition to Bothwell {{led to the formation of}} a coalition of nobles, who styled themselves as the Confederate Lords. Michael Lynch describes the events of 1567 as [...] "second Reformation crisis". Mary and Bothwell confronted the Lords at Carberry Hill on 15 June 1567, but their forces melted away. He fled and she was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle. Ten days after the confrontation at Carbury Hill, the General Assembly met in Edinburgh with the aim of rooting out [...] "superstition and idolatry". The Reformation settlement of 1567 was much more firmly Calvinist than that of 1560. The Assembly set out a programme of reform that included the ratification of the legislation of 1560, better provision of the ministry, new resources and manpower for the parishes, a purge of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> the universities and schools and a closer relationship with parliament. A parliament was called in December, which allowed the acts passed by the Reformation Parliament to be ratified. The subsequent religious settlement would be worked out over the 1570s against a background of civil war and unstable regencies.|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims to {{identify}} which, if any, {{of the most}} influential language teaching methods are discernible in some teachers’ practices. Using qualitative observation as method, I inspect three English lessons. The theoretical background is a description of four language teaching methods: the Grammar-Translation Method, the Direct Method, Audiolingualism, and Communicative Language Teaching. For each method, I provide a list of its most characteristic features, which are then used to analyse the observed lessons. The analysis indicates that <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>in</b> observation A seems to use a variety of methods. <b>The</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>in</b> observation B seems to lean toward the Direct Method, whereas <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>in</b> observation C uses the Grammar-Translation Method...|$|R
