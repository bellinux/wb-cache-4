5|$|When the {{announcer}} {{at the ball}} asks {{if there is a}} doctor in the house, Mac puts his hand up, to Caroline's embarrassment. Things get more embarrassing when Guy also volunteers, and asks why Caroline is sitting next to Mac when she is Guy's fiancée. A unconscious patient lies on an operating table. Guy touches her breasts, takes pictures of her naked body under the blanket, and kisses her. Caroline alleges <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is transgender, which repels Guy. Sue White then appears in a tutu, claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is stalking Mac, and repeating the assertion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is transgender.|$|E
5|$|After {{the car is}} {{disconnected}} {{from the rest of}} the train on a remote rail siding, Mulder questions the Red-Haired Man, who says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is immune to biological warfare. Zama had tried to sneak the patient out of the country, but the government would rather see it destroyed than let their research fall into Japanese hands; the Red-Haired Man was sent to kill them both. Mulder, however, believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is an alien-human hybrid. With help from Scully, Mulder successfully unlocks the door of the railcar, but he is knocked unconscious by the Red-Haired Man. As the Red-Haired Man is about to leave, X appears and shoots him. Realizing that the bomb is about to explode and that there is not enough time to both save Mulder and secure the patient, X decides to save Mulder. X exits carrying the still unconscious Mulder shortly before the bomb explodes.|$|E
5|$|The hospice team is {{required}} by Medicare to meet every 14 days. During this team meeting, patient needs are discussed and planned {{for the next two}} weeks. Additionally, the team reviews the patient's medical condition to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> still meets criteria for hospice care.|$|E

30|$|The {{categories}} of ‘pain, symptoms and side-effects’, ‘cancer’, ‘treatment’, ‘medical device’ and ‘medical procedure’ formed only 14 % of <b>the</b> Actors <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> construed as acting upon them. This data gives little evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> {{identify themselves as}} grammatical Patients. There is also little evidence to support <b>the</b> hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> were under <b>the</b> influence of the ‘medical gaze’ (Foucault 2012) ideology and <b>the</b> idea <b>that</b> <b>patients</b> primarily saw themselves as being acted upon by the doctors and medical personnel. The number of instances in which <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> construes him/herself as the Goal of an action performed by healthcare personnel is very minimal compared {{to the number of}} instances in which <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> construes him/herself as the Actor of an action related to her or his healthcare.|$|R
5|$|The {{procedure}} {{should not}} be used without a medical indication, such as with a reason to expect that a person is at heightened risk of having deep vein thrombosis. This screening is not effective at diagnosing DVT in the absence of other indications <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> may have this condition. A common example of overuse of this procedure is the practice of performing ultrasonography routinely on patients without indication after knee or hip replacement.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 26 September 2016, Pascu's wife called the {{emergency}} number (112) twice. The first time the artist complained about a panic attack and a 3 days lasting insomnia. The ambulance doctor reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> didn't mention previous illness history (namely his previous stroke), he only mentioned his diabetes and his knee pain that prevented him from sleep. Pascu refused hospitalization. His only request was to be administrated something {{in order to get}} some sleep, and the doctor gave him Diazepam. A second call followed a couple of hours later; this time Pascu was unconscious. Doctors tried to resuscitate, but to no avail. It was determined that Pascu died due to a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice care, a patient must have {{certification}} from two physicians {{that he or she}} has less than six months to live if his or her disease runs its natural course; usually the patient's primary physician and the Hospice Medical Director will provide this certification. Patients can and do stay on hospice longer than six months, {{and as long as the}} hospice team continues to certify with supporting evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is terminal, insurance companies will usually continue to pay for hospice care.|$|E

5|$|Later, Gil {{is taken}} to a {{solarium}} to receive the sun's healing rays. While he naps, he transforms into a reptilian creature, horrifying the other patients. Fleeing from the scene, Gil discovers his new appearance. Stern notifies Ann and Dr. Buckell about the incident, theorizing that the exposure to radiation caused a reversal of evolution, transforming Gil into a prehistoric reptile after exposure to sunlight. Stern suggests that Gil can control his symptoms by staying {{in the dark and}} remaining in the hospital, but admits <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> cannot be held against his will.|$|E
5|$|More global {{behavioural}} abnormalities may be noted, {{such as an}} increase in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or delirium. An inability to sit still might represent akathisia, {{a side effect of}} antipsychotic medication. Similarly, a global decrease in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor retardation, akinesia or stupor) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or delirium. The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is experiencing hallucinations), and the quality of eye contact (which can provide clues to the patient's emotional state). Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism.|$|E
5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} {{is caused}} by either a single instance of acute trauma to the knee, or repeated minor trauma to the knee. The trauma can cause extravasation of nearby fluids into the bursa, which stimulates an inflammatory response. This response occurs in two phases: The vascular phase, in which the {{blood flow to the}} surrounding area increases, and the cellular phase, in which leukocytes migrate from the blood to the affected area. Other possible causes include gout, sarcoidosis, CREST syndrome, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, uremia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Some cases are idiopathic, though these may be caused by trauma <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> does not remember.|$|E

40|$|The case of {{a patient}} with {{cirrhosis}} of the liver suffering from severe haemolysis accompanied by circulating `spur cells' is described. Studies performed {{in an attempt to}} determine the cause for the abnormal shape of <b>the</b> erythrocytes demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> serum could induce spur formation in normal compatible cells. Several lines of evidence pointed to <b>the</b> possibility <b>that</b> <b>the</b> factor inducing the spurs was a protein. By column chromatography and gradient ultracentrifugation it was shown <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> low density lipoproteins could induce spurs to form in normal cells...|$|R
50|$|With the {{intercom}} system, the alert {{can be turned}} off from the nurse's station, allowing staff to avoid entry into <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> room if it is determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> need can be met without doing so.|$|R
5|$|Solar {{urticaria}} can {{be difficult}} to diagnose, but its presence can be confirmed by the process of phototesting. There are several forms of these tests including photopatch tests, phototests, photoprovocation tests, and laboratory tests. All of these are necessary to determine the exact infliction <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is suffering from. Photopatch tests are patch tests conducted when it is believed that a patient is experiencing certain symptoms due to an allergy that will only occur when in contact with sunlight. After the procedure, the patient is given a low dosage of UVA radiation.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Emma, Henry and Mary Margaret {{stop by the}} {{hospital}} to see him, only to discover <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> has left {{on his own and}} might be bleeding. Regina and Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) have also shown up, since Regina is the emergency contact for John Doe. She claims that she had found him {{on the side of the}} road unconscious without any memory of what or who he was. As Regina takes Henry home, Emma, Mary Margaret, and the sheriff decide to investigate what happened and visit the security room. They encounter the janitor Leroy (Lee Arenberg), and the security guard Walter, who was sleeping on the job (since he is actually Sleepy). Emma and the others discover that John Doe went out into the woods.|$|E
5|$|After initiation, {{the child}} {{regularly}} visits the hospital outpatient clinic where {{he or she}} is seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks. A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital dietitian and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet. Urinary ketone levels are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect. This is performed using ketone test strips containing nitroprusside, which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).|$|E

5000|$|Patients {{will produce}} {{conversational}} phrases with melodies <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> {{are familiar with}} to practice <b>the</b> real conversation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> may need in their daily life. This technique leads to more successful outcomes if original lyrics of the melodies are presented before the melodies are associated with conversational phrases. The method was also conducted by therapists more than 40 years ago and indicated to be effective. Keith and Aronson [...] had recorded that their stroke patient rehabilitated from aphasia by singing simple conversational phrases to communicate with people.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to differentiate sterile postoperative inflammation from infectious endophthalmitis as the evaluation and treatment of these patients are markedly different. Patients with TASS will often respond quite rapidly to treatment with intense topical corticosteroids. It {{is important}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> be evaluated often to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> inflammation is clearing and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient’s</b> intraocular pressure is under control. The clearing of the inflammation and eventual patient outcome {{is related to the}} severity of the toxic insult at the time of surgery. Fortunately, most patients reported to date are in the category of a moderate toxic inflammation.|$|R
5|$|As Emma, Mary Margaret, and Graham {{search the}} wooded area for John Doe, they {{are joined by}} Henry. Henry {{believes}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is looking for Mary Margaret. They soon discover the patient lying near the bridge seen in the fairytale flashback, and Mary Margaret revives him. As they take {{him back to the}} hospital, Regina shows up with a woman named Kathryn (Griffith), and states that she is his wife and that the patient's name is David Nolan. This devastates Mary Margaret, as she had begun to develop feelings for the patient. Emma becomes suspicious of Regina's ability to find Nolan's wife and questions why Kathryn never bothered to search for him before. Although Regina claims that past hospital surveillance tapes had David mentioning Kathryn's name in his sleep, Emma still believes that Regina is lying. Later that evening, Emma arrives at Mary Margaret's place and agrees to take up the offer of staying with the teacher.|$|E
5|$|During {{a routine}} liposuction {{operation}} in Winnetka, Illinois, Dr. Harrison Lloyd (John Juliani) suddenly begins to remove so much fat {{from a patient}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> dies. Following the unusual experience, Lloyd tells Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) that he killed the patient because he was possessed. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is skeptical about Lloyd's claims, believing he's only making it up to escape legal consequences. Mulder inspects the operation room and discovers a pentagram burned into the floor; he begins to suspect that witchcraft might have {{played a part in}} the crime. Meanwhile, the staff at Lloyd's clinic are shocked when another plastic surgeon, Dr. Ilaqua (Paul Raskin), murders an elderly patient by burning a hole through her cheek and neck with a surgical laser, severing her brain stem. Scully interviews Ilaqua, who claims that he cannot remember anything of the incident. Mulder's suspicions are strengthened when he reviews the tape of the second murder, and he sees a pentagram-like pattern on the stomach of the victim.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Sadler began hosting Sunday tea gatherings at his home, {{which could}} {{accommodate}} fifty guests. Many attendees {{worked in the}} medical establishment, and typically adhered to a progressive ideology. The group often held a forum to discuss the patient with the sleep issue and devise questions for him. The observers withheld the man's name from the group, but relayed some of his statements. In 1925, the forum, which then had thirty members, closed their meetings to visitors and began to require a pledge of secrecy. Sadler instructed forum members not to publicize what they learned, telling them that they had an incomplete picture of what was occurring. He also feared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> would face criticism if his identity were known. His identity has never been confirmed; Joscelyn Godwin, of Colgate University, and skeptic Martin Gardner posit that the sleeping man was Wilfred Kellogg, the husband of Lena's sister Anna.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{end-of-life}} {{cases in}} Italy and national and comparative data from hospitals {{and nursing homes}} show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient’s</b> refusal of life-prolonging treatment is not always taken seriously. Some legal experts contend <b>that</b> <b>the</b> professional autonomy of doctors encompasses the freedom to administer treatment that is not wanted by <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b> I do not share their views. I argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient’s</b> right to refuse life-prolonging treatment {{is grounded in the}} highest law of the country, the Constitution, at article 32, second paragraph. In support of my argument, I present the results of a research on the Acts of the Constituent Assembly (1947) and a review of case law of the Constitutional Court on informed consent...|$|R

5|$|Treatment of TBI varies {{based on}} the {{location}} and severity of injury and whether the patient is stable or having trouble breathing, but ensuring that the airway is patent so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> can breathe is always of paramount importance. Ensuring an open airway and adequate ventilation may be difficult in people with TBI. Intubation, one method to secure the airway, {{may be used to}} bypass a disruption in the airway in order to send air to the lungs. If necessary, a tube can be placed into the uninjured bronchus, and a single lung can be ventilated. If there is a penetrating injury to the neck through which air is escaping, the trachea may be intubated through the wound. Multiple unsuccessful attempts at conventional (direct) laryngoscopy may threaten the airway, so alternative techniques to visualize the airway, such as fiberoptic or video laryngoscopy, may be employed to facilitate tracheal intubation. If the upper trachea is injured, an incision can be made in the trachea (tracheotomy) or the cricothyroid membrane (cricothyrotomy, or cricothyroidotomy) in order to ensure an open airway. However, cricothyrotomy may not be useful if the trachea is lacerated below the site of the artificial airway. Tracheotomy is used sparingly because it can cause complications such as infections and narrowing of the trachea and larynx. When it is impossible to establish a sufficient airway, or when complicated surgery must be performed, cardiopulmonary bypass may be used—blood is pumped out of the body, oxygenated by a machine, and pumped back in. If a pneumothorax occurs, a chest tube may be inserted into the pleural cavity to remove the air.|$|E
