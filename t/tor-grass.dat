50|$|The site is grazed {{to prevent}} the {{dominant}} growth of upright brome and <b>tor-grass.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{site has}} species-rich {{grassland}} on Jurassic limestone. The dominant grasses are <b>tor-grass</b> and upright brome and flora include rock-rose, salad burnet, yellow-wort and autumn gentian.|$|E
50|$|This is a disused quarry {{which has}} {{grassland}} on Jurassic limestone. The main grasses are <b>tor-grass</b> and sheep's fescue, {{and there are}} the nationally rare plants spotted cat's ear and pasque flower.|$|E
50|$|The {{grassland}} includes upright brome, <b>tor-grass,</b> sheep's fescue and a {{range of}} plants which flourish on calcareous soils. These include autumn gentian, clustered bellflower, common calamint, ploughman's spikenard and rock rose. There are large quantities of kidney vetch on the site.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{a narrow}} {{grassland}} valley, {{which is one of}} the most florally diverse chalk downlands in Berkshire. The dominant plants are upright brome and <b>tor-grass,</b> and it is the only site in the county which has the nationally rare bastard-toadflax (Thesium humifusum).|$|E
50|$|The site {{is notable}} for (in the {{grassland}} areas) Festuca ovina (sheep's fescue), Avenula pratensis (meadow oat-grass), Brachypodium pinnatum (<b>tor-grass),</b> and Polyommatus bellargus (Adonis Blue) - a nationally scarce species of butterfly, {{and in the}} scrub areas, Crataegus monogyna (common hawthorn), and Hedera helix (ivy).|$|E
50|$|The {{limestone}} grassland consists {{largely of}} upright brome with <b>tor-grass</b> on steeper parts where site is ungrazed. The vegetation is tussocky with encroaching scrub while a shorter herb-rich sward {{occurs in the}} grazed area. The neutral grassland community has more abundant false oat-grass and cock's foot.|$|E
50|$|Ungrazed {{calcareous}} grassland {{makes up the}} northern section of the site, which consists mainly of Upright Brome, <b>Tor-grass,</b> Common Rock Rose and Old Man's Beard. Larger trees such as Oak and Ash are regenerating in this area. There is an adjacent Larch plantation which is supporting Juniper.|$|E
50|$|Brachypodium pinnatum, the heath {{false brome}} or <b>tor-grass,</b> is {{a plant in}} the grass family, with a {{widespread}} distribution in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in calcareous grassland, and reaches 70 - 120 cm tall. The flowerhead is open, with 10 to 15 erect spikelets.|$|E
50|$|The pasture faces {{south to}} {{south-east}} and species include Upright Brome, <b>Tor-grass,</b> Red Fescue, Meadow Oat-grass and Quaking-grass. It is herb-rich and includes Common Rock-rose, Dwarf Thistle, Thyme, Salad Burnet and {{several species of}} orchid (notably Pyramidal Orchid, Bee Orchid and Green-winged Orchid. The nationally scarce Bastard Toadflax is recorded.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{an example}} of {{unimproved}} limestone grassland. Among the more notable plants species are bastard-toadflax (Thesium humifusum), Dyer's greenweed (Genista tinctoria), and musk orchid (Herminium monorchis). Other species present include yellow-wort (Blackstonia perfoliata), kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), devil's-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), bee orchid (Ophrys apifera), <b>tor-grass</b> (Brachypodium pinnatum) and upright brome (Bromus erectus).|$|E
50|$|The central plateau {{supports}} a short grassland sward (due to stock grazing) with longer vegetation on the steeper slopes. The grassland includes upright brome, <b>tor-grass,</b> sheep's fescue, quaking grass and crested dog's-tail. Flowering herbs include common rock-rose, harebell, chalk milkwort and field scabious. The area {{has a significant}} population of orchids, including the bee orchid, fragrant orchid and frog orchid.|$|E
50|$|The females {{lay their}} eggs in rows of 5 to 6 (although as many as 15 have been recorded) on the flower-sheath of <b>Tor-grass</b> (Brachypodium pinnatum), preferring the dead sheaths of tall plants. The care taken by females over where to {{lay their eggs}} is {{considered}} the only remarkable part of the Lulworth skipper breeding process, otherwise it is considered common.|$|E
50|$|The main {{species of}} grass is upright brome (Bromus erectus), though <b>tor-grass</b> (Brachypodium pinnatum) is also common. In areas of heavy grazing, sheep fescue (Festuca ovina) and meadow {{oat-grass}} (Helictotrichon pratense) can take over. Blue sedge (Carex flacca), spring sedge (Carex caryophyllea), dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule), salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor), burnet saxifrage (Pimpinella saxifraga), and devil’s bit (Succisa pratensis) are also common.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is an area}} of {{calcareous}} grassland lying over Oolitic (Jurassic) Limestone covered by shallow, well-drained soils. The Tumps is above Congrove Field, and {{is believed to be the}} site of mining activities in the past. The grassland communities present are of the <b>Tor-grass</b> (Brachypodium pinnatum) type showing elements of both the Meadow Oat-grass-wild thyme (Avenula pratensis)-(Thymus praecox) and the Knapweed-Rough Hawkbit (Centaurea nigra)-(Leontodon hispidus) variants.|$|E
50|$|The {{grassland}} {{is dominated}} by grasses such as upright brome, sheep's fescue, {{and there is little}} <b>tor-grass.</b> The latter makes the common different from others in the region. Herbs include rock-rose, common bird's-foot-trefoil, salad burnet and wild thyme. Orchids are in abundance including autumn lady's tresses, green-winged orchid and fragrant orchid, particularly in the quarry areas. There are scrub areas of hawthorn and there some trees such as ash.|$|E
50|$|The {{site is a}} mile long {{narrow strip}} above a rail tunnel, which is rarely used, next to the Midland Main Line between Bedford and Wellingborough. The reserve is grassland, grazed by rabbits, on {{limestone}} deposited during {{the construction of the}} railway. The dominant plant is <b>tor-grass,</b> and flowers include dyer's greenweed and wild liquorice. Scattered scrub provides food and shelter from kestrels and buzzards for small mammals and nesting birds.|$|E
50|$|The {{grassland}} plateau supports <b>tor-grass,</b> upright brome, sheep's fescue and quaking grass. This area {{is relatively}} short {{as it is}} grazed and there is recreational use. The slopes support a higher sward {{and this is the}} area for insect life. Herbs recorded include chalk milkwort, clustered bellflower, kidney vetch and autumn gentian. There are several species of orchid which include frog orchid, bee orchid and musk orchid. The rare pasqueflower is recorded at this site.|$|E
50|$|Eggs {{are laid}} singly on the {{underside}} of foodplant leaves and hatch after about two weeks. They are normally laid on cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata) but they will occasionally use purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea), false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum), <b>tor-grass</b> (B. pinnatum) and wood small-reed (Calamagrostis epigejos). Larvae also feed on various Poaceae, Phalaris arundinacea, Alopecurus pratensis, Calamagrostis purpurea, Deschampsia flexuosa, Phragmites communis and Roegneria canina., but also on Festuca, Triticum, Dactylis glomerata, Molinia, Holcus lanatus, Luzula, etc.|$|E
50|$|Plants which grow on {{the western}} scree include {{pyramidal}} orchid, autumna gentian and wild mignonette. The areas of the quarry which are now grassed support <b>tor-grass</b> and upright brome mixed with other species. These include fairy flax, harebell, dropwort, field scabious, lady's bedstraw, quaking-grass and woolly thistle. It is recorded that the bare limestone rubble, {{which is on the}} face of the main excavation area, used to support the rare perfoliate or Cotswold pennycress. This has not been seen for some time.|$|E
50|$|The {{range of}} plants is wide and {{includes}} bee orchid, horseshoe vetch and chalk milkwort. The site supports an abundant population of pyramidal orchids. Typical plants which flourish {{on the site}} are cowslip, salad burnet, common rock-rose, yellow-rattle, burnet-saxifrage, oxeye daisy, spring-sedge (Carex caryophyllea) and marjoram. Grasses include upright brome, quaking-grass, sweet vernal-grass, crested hair-grass, yellow oat-grass and sheep's fescue. <b>Tor-grass</b> is dominant but in small areas. Devil's-bit scabious is present on the lower slopes. Sainfoin has entered the site from surrounding fields.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{management method}} of sheep grazing {{is used to}} control the growth of <b>tor-grass</b> and upright brome. This encourages the wild flowers to flourish and to spread. Cattle grazing helps to control scrub, the clearance and control of which is important to maintain the open areas of pasture. The correct grazing balance has to be maintained - too much will overgraze the site and too little will allow the vigorous grasses to flourish {{to the detriment of}} the flowers.|$|E
50|$|The North Downs support several {{important}} habitats. The most distinctive {{of these is}} chalk grassland, which is largely limited to steep escarpment and valley slopes. This semi-natural habitat is maintained through sheep, cattle and rabbit grazing which prevents scrub encroachment. Chalk grassland {{to the west of}} the Medway Valley is dominated by upright brome (Bromus erectus) and fescue (Festuca) whilst grassland to the east is dominated by <b>tor-grass</b> (Brachypodium pinnatum). Because of the close proximity of the North Downs to the European continent, the warm climate and the south facing escarpment, several plant species survive on the chalk grassland which are scarce or not found elsewhere in the British Isles.|$|E
50|$|Eggs {{are laid}} in strings on the stems of grasses where they remain over the winter. The Essex skipper's favoured foodplant is cock's-foot (Dactylis glomerata), and it rarely uses the small skipper's favoured foodplant Yorkshire fog. Essex skippers' other foods include {{creeping}} soft grass (Holcus mollis), couch grass (Elymus repens), timothy-grass (Phleum pratense), meadow foxtail (Alopecurus pratensis), false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum) and <b>tor-grass</b> (Brachypodium pinnatum). This skipper's caterpillars emerge {{in the spring and}} feed until June before forming shelters from leaves tied with silk {{at the base of the}} foodplant to pupate. Adults fly from July through August. Like most skippers, they are fairly strictly diurnal, though individuals are very rarely encountered during the night.|$|E
50|$|Habitats are {{primarily}} on unfertilised calcareous grassland; this includes chalk download, coastal grassland and undercliffs in Britain. In {{all of these}} habits <b>Tor-grass</b> (Illustration 2), the butterfly's sole food plant and that on which it lays eggs, is widespread. Tall, ungrazed grass is a favoured habitat due to oviposition and larval development; Lulworth skippers {{have benefited from the}} move away from tight grazing by sheep in the last century and recently outbreaks of myxomatosis among rabbit populations, which otherwise maintain a lower grass height. However, there is evidence to suggest that minimal grazing is not detrimental to the species, and may in fact be beneficial in that it encourages the growth of flowers that act as adult nectar sources.|$|E
50|$|The site {{supports}} {{a range of}} habitats which include unimproved calcareous grassland, woodland and scrub, cliff faces and scree slopes. The grassland is of major importance and it comprises a tall ungrazed sward. This is dominated by <b>tor-grass,</b> upright brome, meadow oat-grass, sweet vernal-grass and quaking grass. It is noted for its range of herbs which include salad burnet, common rock-rose, common bird's-foot-trefoil. The quarry floors support wild thyme, dwarf thistle, yellow-wort and autumn gentian. The site supports many plants which are scarce at a national or county level. These include fly orchid, musk orchid and purple milk-vetch. It {{is one of a}} small number of sites which support meadow clary in the county.|$|E
50|$|Upon hatching, the 2.5 cm (1 in) long larva spins {{a compact}} cocoon {{on the site}} of the eggshell. In this, it will overwinter until around the third week of April, at which point it will eat its way out by making a small hole in the side of the sheath. The {{caterpillar}} will then search for tender <b>Tor-grass</b> blades and feed upon them by chewing out notches from the margin. During this time, it will live separately, within a tube composed of the two edges of a blade bound by cords of silk. Fresh tubes will be made as the caterpillar grows larger. Lulworth skipper caterpillars live in the warmest zone of a grass clump, at a height of 20 to 40 cm.|$|E
50|$|Certain knapweeds have a {{tendency}} to dominate large stretches of landscape together with a few other plants, typically one or two grasses and as many other large herbs. The common knapweed (C. nigra) for example is plentiful in the mesotrophic grasslands of England and nearby regions. It is most prominently found in pastures or meadows dominated by cock's-foot (Dactylis glomerata) as well as either of crested dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus) and false oat-grass (Arrhenatherum elatius). It is also often found in mesotrophic grassland on rendzinas and similar calcareous soils in association with glaucous sedge (Carex flacca), sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), and either <b>tor-grass</b> (Brachypodium pinnatum) and rough hawkbit (Leontodon hispidus), or upright brome (Bromus erectus). In these grasslands, greater knapweed (C. scabiosa) is found much more rarely by comparison, often in association with red fescue (Festuca rubra) in addition to cock's-foot and false oat-grass.|$|E
40|$|Floristic and {{vegetation}} studies {{were conducted in}} an experimental area of the Italian Karst at Basovizza/Bazovica included in the Natura 2000 site “Carso Triestino e Goriziano” to assess {{the effects of the}} reintroduction of grazing on plant species and communities. In the area, partially deforested in 2006, cattle, sheep and goats were introduced in the summer of 2007. A monitoring programme for plant populations was performed focusing on four target species typical of the karst dry grasslands: Rock Knapweed Centaurea rupestris, Green-winged Orchid Orchis morio, Toothed Orchid Orchis tridentata and Mountain Pasqueflower Pulsatilla montana. Three exotic invasive species, detrimental to grazing, were also included: Tree of Heaven Ailanthus altissima, Narrow-leaved Ragwort Senecio inaequidens and Common Ragweed Ambrosia artemisiifolia. For each species, the GPS position was taken both for individuals and large groups of plants; a count of the individuals present at each measured point was performed too. In order to verify the process of re-colonization by species of calcareous dry grasslands, phytosociological relevés were carried out in areas previously occupied by Black Pine (Pinus nigra) plantations, woods with Downy Oak (Quercus pubescens) and Hop Hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia) and thermophilous scrub of Common Juniper (Juniperus communis), documented from vegetation maps made in 2005. For each vegetation type 6 permanent plots were selected, in which phytosociological relevés were carried out to. The study shows that in the areas of the original karst dry grassland more widely distributed species typical of the habitat remain. In overgrazed areas the grassy turf is discontinuous, segetal terophytic species of the class Stellarietea mediae entering into the gaps. Cover of the Musk Thistle (Carduus nutans) has increased significantly, as spiny species are not palatable to animals. The occasional presence of neophytes such as Daisy Fleabane (Erigeron annuus) and Canadian Horseweed (Conyza canadensis) was also found. In undergrazed areas, however, the natural processes of succession and scrubbing over are taking place. In the areas formerly occupied by pine plantations and woods with Quercus pubescens and Ostrya carpinifolia, Autumn Moor Grass (Sesleria autumnalis) and Rock <b>Tor-grass</b> (Brachypodium rupestre) are still able to become covered by a compact herbaceous sward. An abundant presence of Carduus nutans and the entry of Senecio inaequidens, the latter especially abundant on wood chips derived from tree clearing, were encountered as well as the spread of Ailanthus altissima favoured by the opening up of the scrubland...|$|E
