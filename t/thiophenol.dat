25|$|The final {{efforts were}} {{directed}} at placing methyl groups at position 5 and 15. With position 10 sufficiently shielded reaction with chloromethyl benzyl ether produced the di(chloromethyl) adduct which was further converted to the dithiophenyl compound 63 using <b>thiophenol,</b> isolation of which required thin layer chromatography. Desulfurisation took place with Raney nickel and the reduction reaction also opened the lactone ring to the carboxylic acid which was converted to the ester 64 by reaction with diazomethane. At this stage {{the number of}} isomers in the mixture was reduced by HPLC to just two with the racemic propionic acid ester group at C13 (ring C) remaining in 65. Reaction with sulfuric acid converted the cyano group to the amide group in 66, again destroying stereochemistry at C13. The correct isomer 67 (minor yield) was isolated again by HPLC.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{protective}} {{group in}} 26 (acetal, acid hydrolysis) was reconverted to the ketone in 27. The monooxime 28 (at the more hindered ketone group) was synthesised from the dioxime by selective hydrolysis (nitrous acid / acetic acid [...] ). The new nitrogen atom {{is also the}} second nitrogen atom required for the AD building block. Both the cyclopentene ring and the cyclohexenone ring were oxidized next in an ozonolysis (ozone) forming triketone 29, an aldol condensation of the 1,5-dicarbonyl unit (pyrrolidine acetate) formed cyclohexene 30 with tosylation of the oxime group, a second oxidation with periodic acid cleaves the cyclohexene ring and diazomethane esterifies the resulting carboxylic acid group in 31. A Beckmann rearrangement (methanol, sodium polystyrene sulfonate 2 hrs, 170°C) took place next to lactam 32 (not isolated) which reacted further to the tetracycle 33 called alpha-corrnorsterone in an amine-carbonyl condensation - aldol condensation cascade. This compound resisted [...] ring-opening of the lactam group due to incorrect stereochemistry of the propionic ester side-chain. The alpha compound was therefore converted its epimer 34 by first equilibrating in excess base followed by reacidifiying and diazomethane treatment. This epimer was then converted to the 35 by the simultaneous action of methanol and <b>thiophenol.</b> This ensured the differentiation of what will become the imidazole tail. [...] The [...] Ozonolysis gave aldehyde 36 with ammonia converting the thioester into an amide group and aldehyde reduction (sodium borohydride) followed by mesylation and bromination (lithium bromide) gave the bromide 37 with conversion of the amide group into a nitrile group as the completed AD section.|$|E
