5|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>operational</b> {{doctrine}} {{developed by}} the RAF, in the circumstance of deploying a large scale nuclear strike, each Victor would have operated entirely independently; the crews would conduct their mission without external guidance and be reliant upon {{the effectiveness of their}} individual tactics to reach and successfully attack their assigned target; thus great emphasis was placed on continuous crew training during peacetime. Developing a sense of a crew unity was considered highly important; Victor crews would typically serve together for at least five years, and a similar approach was adopted with ground personnel. In order to maximise <b>the</b> <b>operational</b> lifespan of each aircraft, Victor crews typically flew a single five-hour training mission per week. Each crew member was required to qualify for servicing certificates to independently undertake inspection, refuelling and turnaround operations.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{operations}} for the incursion {{got off to a}} slow start.

40|$|Abstract. Constraint Handling Rules (CHRs) are a {{high-level}} rulebased programming language {{commonly used to}} write constraint solvers. <b>The</b> theoretical <b>operational</b> semantics for CHRs is highly non-deterministic and relies on writing confluent programs to have a meaningful behaviour. Implementations of CHRs use an operational semantics which is considerably finer than <b>the</b> theoretical <b>operational</b> semantics, but is still nondeterministic (from the user’s perspective). This paper formally defines this refined operational semantics and proves it implements <b>the</b> theoretical <b>operational</b> semantics. It also shows {{how to create a}} (partial) confluence checker capable of detecting programs which are confluent under this semantics, but not under <b>the</b> theoretical <b>operational</b> semantics. This supports the use of new idioms in CHR programs. ...|$|R
