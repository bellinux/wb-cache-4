50|$|Kaiser's {{hope that}} the Darrin would entice dealers to order more of the company's {{standard}} models did not prove true. By early 1954, many Kaiser franchises had either switched to other auto makers or {{had gone out of}} business. Few ordered any Darrins at all. Since consumer confidence in Kaiser's future had become low, buyers generally did not want to purchase any Kaiser, let alone one that, while attractive, also seemed impractical and was priced as a luxury item. A lack of orders prompted Kaiser in July to reduce the Darrin's wholesale price by about five percent. Later that month, the company's general sales manager, Roy Abernethy, offered substantial dealer incentives on all Kaisers. These included a $700 <b>trade-in</b> <b>allowance</b> on any Darrin.|$|E

40|$|I {{study the}} {{relative}} role of technological and physical obsolescence in {{the determination of}} the timing of adoption and the monopolist s incentives to innovate. I show that depreciation of durable goods (physical obsolescence) makes decisions about the timing of adoption non-trivial. If the monopolist cannot perfectly restrict the timing of purchases (using purchase deadlines, <b>trade-in</b> <b>allowances,</b> etc.) then its optimal pricing policy will inefficiently delay adoption, which in turn will reduce the incentives to innovate.

40|$|To {{survive in}} the ceaseless cycle of competition, {{businesses}} have developed strategies to become sustainable. These strategies include reusing products, which can lead {{not only to the}} creation of economic benefits but also to improvements in a corporation’s social and environmental responsibility. Product reuse can also increase the profit earned on new products by compensating customers who bring in old products to buy new ones, as the ensuing remanufacturing process allows for the reuse of materials and thus drives down costs. As businesses have come to recognize these values, the marketing competition to retrieve used products from customers has intensified. This research focuses on identifying effective compensation strategies to determine the appropriate advertising investment and trade-in value in a market where two homogeneous retailers compete. Retailers advertise to secure more customers to trade in their used products and to generate more trade-in sales than competitors do. A retailer’s results may vary according to its competitor’s investment strategy, which makes it useful to employ information on past competitor investment patterns to plan future investment strategies. However, as competitors using one another’s information may intensify the competition, better investment results could be obtained by ignoring competitor investment information. Therefore, this study suggests four competition strategies that determine the advertisement costs and <b>trade-in</b> <b>allowance</b> spent by retailers and discusses the difference in the profits obtained by the retailers under each of the four strategies...|$|E
40|$|Reimbursement for tax, {{effect of}} collecting, see Regulation 1700. Vehicle Engine Exchanges {{in lieu of}} repairs, see Regulation 1547. (a) BARTER AND EXCHANGE GENERALLY. The terms “sale ” and “purchase ” as defined in {{sections}} 6011 and 6012 respectively, include exchange and barter, and gross receipts and sales price constituting the measure of tax include the amount allowed by a retailer to his customer for property or services of any kind. Thus, the operator of an “exchange ” where customers pay for their purchases of tangible personal property entirely or in part by other property is a retailer and taxable upon his gross receipts, unless his sales are insufficient in number, scope and character to constitute an activity requiring the holding of a seller’s permit. (b) MERCHANDISE TRADED IN. (1) IN GENERAL. When merchandise is “traded in ” on the purchase price of other merchandise, the retailer accepting the trade-in must include in the measure of tax the amount agreed upon between seller and buyer as the allowance for the merchandise traded in. Should, however, the board find that the allowance stated in the agreement {{is less than the}} fair market value, it shall be presumed that the allowance actually agreed upon is such market value. (2) DISCOUNT AND <b>TRADE-IN</b> <b>ALLOWANCE</b> ON SAME TRANSACTION. Although discounts allowed and taken by purchasers are not a part of taxable gross receipts, if there is a trade-in and also a discount, the contrac...|$|E
