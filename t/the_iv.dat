5|$|On 7 May 1915, <b>the</b> <b>IV</b> Scouting Group, {{which by}} then {{consisted}} of Stettin, Stuttgart, , and Danzig, and twenty-one torpedo boats was sent into the Baltic Sea {{to support a}} major operation against Russian positions at Libau. The operation was commanded by Rear Admiral Hopman, {{the commander of the}} reconnaissance forces in the Baltic. <b>The</b> <b>IV</b> Scouting Group was tasked with screening to the north to prevent any Russian naval forces from moving out of the Gulf of Finland undetected, while several armored cruisers and other warships bombarded the port. The Russians did attempt to intervene with a force of four cruisers: Admiral Makarov, Bayan, Oleg, and Bogatyr. The Russian ships briefly engaged München, but both sides were unsure of the others' strength, and so both disengaged. Shortly after the bombardment, Libau was captured by the advancing German army, and Stettin and the rest of <b>the</b> <b>IV</b> Scouting Group were recalled to the High Seas Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Starting on 2 September, <b>the</b> <b>IV</b> Squadron, {{assisted}} by the armored cruiser , conducted a sweep into the Baltic. The operation lasted until 9 September {{and failed to}} bring Russian naval units to battle. From 11 to 20 September, Elsass {{and the rest of}} the division was transferred to the mouth of the Elbe to provide local defense against possible British attacks. Later that month, <b>the</b> <b>IV</b> Squadron ships were transferred back to the Baltic. The army had requested that the navy make a demonstration to keep Russian reserves along the Baltic coast, instead of allowing the Russians to re-deploy them to Galicia. The older battleships of the V Battle Squadron were sent to Danzig to embark ground forces, while Braunschweig and <b>the</b> <b>IV</b> Squadron steamed in advance. The operation was called off early, however, after British submarines were reportedly sighted in the Baltic. The two squadrons rendezvoused off Bornholm before proceeded on to Kiel, arriving on 26 September.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Mecklenburg {{and the rest of}} her class were mobilized to serve in <b>the</b> <b>IV</b> Battle Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt. The squadron was initially allocated to the North Sea, but was temporarily transferred to the Baltic in September. Starting on 3 September, <b>the</b> <b>IV</b> Squadron, assisted by the armored cruiser , conducted a sweep into the eastern Baltic {{in the direction of the}} Svenska Högarna islands. The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle. The squadron participated in a demonstration off Windau the next day. From 5 December to 2 April 1915, Mecklenburg and the rest of the squadron were assigned to guard duty in the North Sea, based in the mouth of the Elbe.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Schwaben {{and the rest of}} her class were mobilized to serve in <b>the</b> <b>IV</b> Battle Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt. After it reached full combat readiness, the Squadron was employed both as a defense force in the German Bight—usually stationed in the mouth of the Elbe—and for operations in the Baltic. Starting on 3 September, <b>the</b> <b>IV</b> Squadron, assisted by the armored cruiser , conducted a sweep into the Baltic. The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle. In May 1915, IV Squadron, including Schwaben, was transferred to support the German Army in the Baltic Sea area. Schwaben and her sisters were then based in Kiel. During this period, she served as the flagship of the second command admiral of the Squadron, KAdm Alberts.|$|E

5|$|After {{the start}} of World War I in August 1914, Wittelsbach was brought back to active duty in <b>the</b> <b>IV</b> Battle Squadron.

By late 1915, crew shortages and the threat from British submarines forced the Kaiserliche Marine to withdraw older battleships like Wittelsbach. The ship then saw service in auxiliary roles, first as a training ship {{and then as a}} ship's tender. After the war, she was converted into a tender for minesweepers in 1919.

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of web services published over the Web highlights {{the need for an}} effective method for users to find appropriate web services. Existing web service discovery methods do not effectively aid a user in finding suitable web services. The current methods provide textual lists of web services that the user is required to explore and manually evaluate. Thus, these methods lead to time-consuming and ineffective web service discovery. The aim of this research was to investigate using information visualization (IV) techniques to effectively support web service discovery. <b>The</b> node-and-link network <b>IV</b> technique was selected as <b>the</b> most appropriate <b>IV</b> technique to visualize web service collections. A prototype, called SerViz, was developed as a tool for interactive visualization of web service collections incorporating <b>the</b> node-and-link <b>IV</b> technique and an alphabetical list-based technique. SerViz used the Programmable Web web service collection as the sample web service collection. A usability evaluation was conducted to compare these techniques. Ninety percent of participants preferred <b>the</b> network <b>IV</b> technique for visualizing web service collections. <b>The</b> network <b>IV</b> technique was also faster for browsing. Several usability problems were identified with <b>the</b> network <b>IV</b> technique. This motivated a need for implementing an alternative IV technique in SerViz. <b>The</b> node-and-link tree <b>IV</b> technique was selected as it was more structured than <b>the</b> network <b>IV</b> technique. A usability evaluation was conducted to compare the network and tree IV techniques. Participants slightly preferred <b>the</b> tree <b>IV</b> technique as <b>the</b> technique to visualize web service collections. <b>The</b> tree <b>IV</b> technique was faster for browsing the web service collection while <b>the</b> network <b>IV</b> technique was faster for searching and filtering. This research has determined that IV techniques can be used to effectively support web service discovery. Future work will involve using IV techniques to support collaborative web service discovery.
