5|$|Broom Pit was {{the deepest}} at , and longest-lasting of the Middleton collieries. In 1896 the Middleton Broom, Little and Middleton Main Pits, all managed by John Neal, {{employed}} over 600 workers. By 1923 just <b>the</b> <b>Broom</b> Pit was working, employing more than 1,000 men and supplying coking, gas and household coal and fireclay to the brickworks. Nearly 900 men were employed there in 1940. At {{the time the}} collieries were nationalised in 1947, the workforce had reduced to 436. Operations at the pit ended in 1968 as the productivity of the colliery declined.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb them before they slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. <b>The</b> <b>broom</b> can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|E

5|$|The {{club was}} founded on 16 October 1878 as an amateur side known as Ipswich A.F.C., under the {{presidency}} of local MP Thomas Cobbold who had played football at Charterhouse School. George S Sherrington & J. M. Franks were elected joint Captains. Ipswich A.F.C.'s first match was a 6–1 home victory over Stoke Wanderers at <b>the</b> <b>Broom</b> Hill ground on 2 November 1878. This {{was followed by a}} 2–0 victory over Harwich in the club's first away match. Losing only one game in 17 in its second season, the club was able to build enough interest to enrol players for a second team. Ipswich recorded their biggest ever victory during the 1880–81 season, a 15–0 defeat of East Stamford with one player, John Knights, registering a treble hat trick; both achievements remain club records. The team moved to Portman Road, the current ground, in 1884, and would share, until 1936, the facilities with the East Suffolk Cricket Club who had played there since 1855. The Cobbold family involvement continued when, in 1885, Nathanael Fromanteel Cobbold was elected as a vice-president of the club. Following his sudden death the following year, the position was then held by his nephew John Dupuis Cobbold.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} royal heraldic badge is a {{sprig of}} common broom, {{said to have}} been worn by Geoffrey of Anjou in his cap. <b>The</b> <b>broom</b> plant or Plantegenest (planta genista in medieval Latin), thus became Geoffrey's nickname; 'Plantagenet'. The heraldic device also became the name of the dynasty that was borne from him, which was to rule England for over 300 years. The Plantagenet kings would use this badge, sometimes combining it with other more personal devices. King Henry II used the 'planta genista' as well as an escarbuncle. King Richard I used a star and crescent device, which was also adopted by his brother King John. King Henry III adopted <b>the</b> <b>broom</b> sprig and the star and crescent. His son Edward I in addition to these, added the golden rose device that he inherited from his mother Eleanor of Provence. King Edward II further added the golden castle of Castile, inherited from his mother Eleanor of Castile.|$|E

25|$|In 1940 Mickey {{appeared}} in his first feature-length film, Fantasia. His screen role as The Sorcerer's Apprentice, set to the symphonic poem {{of the same name}} by Paul Dukas, is perhaps the most famous segment of the film and one of Mickey's most iconic roles. The segment features no dialogue at all, only the music. The apprentice (Mickey), not willing to do his chores, puts on the sorcerer's magic hat after the sorcerer goes to bed and casts a spell on a broom, which causes <b>the</b> <b>broom</b> to come to life and perform the most tiring chore—filling up a deep well using two buckets of water. When the well eventually overflows, Mickey finds himself unable to control <b>the</b> <b>broom,</b> leading to a near-flood. After the segment ends, Mickey is seen in silhouette shaking hands with Leopold Stokowski, who conducts all the music heard in Fantasia. Mickey has often been pictured in the red robe and blue sorcerer's hat in merchandising. It was also featured into the climax of Fantasmic!, an attraction at the Disney theme parks.|$|E

25|$|Three hoops {{are placed}} {{on either side of}} the pitch of differing heights (0.91m, 1.37m and 1.83m), placed two broomsticks apart (2.34 m). Chasers and keepers can score by {{throwing}} the quaffle through any one of the hoops, from either front or back, gaining ten points for their team per score. Any player experiencing a knock-out effect from either dismounting their broomstick or getting hit with a bludger must touch with any part of their body excluding <b>the</b> <b>broom</b> any one of their hoops before returning to play.|$|E
25|$|Chasers are {{responsible}} for passing the quaffle and scoring points by throwing the quaffle {{through one of the}} opponent's goals for 10 points. When a bludger hits a chaser in possession of the quaffle, they must drop the quaffle, remove <b>the</b> <b>broom</b> from between their legs, and touch their own hoops to rejoin play. Chasers not in possession of the quaffle must perform the same knockout procedure when hit by a bludger, but do not have a ball to drop. Chasers may enter into physical contact with opposing chasers or keepers. There are three chasers on the field for each team, identified by a white headband.|$|E
25|$|The {{memorial}} is set {{within a}} garden {{and surrounded by}} iron railings. It is positioned inside the entrance to Martin's Hill, Bromley's first ornamental park. Martin's Hill was ostensibly named after a baker who once resided there. For years, the residents of Bromley promenaded on the hill. In {{the latter half of}} the 1800s, Martin's Hill had a commanding view of the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, London. Bromley itself took its name from <b>the</b> <b>broom,</b> a yellow-flowered shrub, that once grew abundantly in the area. In the 1800s, Martin's Hill was one of the last places that still had flowering broom. In 1878, the site was acquired by the Bromley Council; trees and flower beds were planted, and it became an ornamental park.|$|E
5000|$|In general, spruce broom rust in {{considered}} {{more of a}} cosmetic issue, {{and in many cases}} no serious management measures are required. However, potential economic consequences can be seen in commercial logging areas. In order to manage this, trees with stem cankers or brooms are selectively removed or <b>the</b> <b>brooms</b> are pruned off of the trees. Pruning of <b>brooms</b> is <b>the</b> most effective and economical control option while still reducing the risk of stem breakage and maintaining tree vigor. If the infection occurs on the tree’s main bole, the entire top must be removed, including <b>the</b> <b>brooms.</b> Additionally, since both bearberry and spruce must be in the same area for Chrysomyxa arctostaphyli to survive and complete its life cycle, there is the option to remove all bearberry within 1,000 feet of the spruce. Although effective, this route is often hard to accomplish and expensive. A related control measure would be to attempt to reduce moisture around the bearberry in order to prevent secondary infection, but the logistics of this would also be challenging.No chemical measures like fungicides {{have been found to be}} effective as of yet, so only the mechanical option of physically removing <b>the</b> <b>brooms</b> to prevent <b>the</b> spread of aeciospores is effective. Since spruce broom rust is mostly cosmetic, infections can potentially be left on the tree to provide habitat for birds and small mammals, which use <b>the</b> large, dense <b>brooms</b> for both resting and nesting.|$|R

25|$|In 1865 {{more than}} 80 acres of Ripley's land holding were still undeveloped. The area was dotted with the Bowling Iron Company's former mine workings.

Ripley Ville occupied most of <b>the</b> <b>Broom</b> Hall Estate: Broom Hall was a working farmhouse into the 1860s.

Its central street fell 40 feet over a distance of 300 feet but it was relatively free of old mine workings and contiguous to the urban development along Hall Lane which gave access to the town centre.|$|E
