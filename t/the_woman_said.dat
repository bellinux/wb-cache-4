500|$|On another occasion, {{when she}} visited Bermuda, she {{was invited to}} a {{reception}} and chose to walk rather than be driven. She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy {{for a glass of}} water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>said</b> that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: [...] "Well {{take a good look at}} me now, so you can be sure to know me tomorrow at St. Georges." [...] The Princess clung to her privacy, and enjoyed not being recognised.|$|E
500|$|Although Mary I and Elizabeth I {{differed}} religiously, both performed elaborate Maundy ceremonies. [...] Records from 1556 {{show that}} Mary washed {{the feet of}} forty-one poor women (reflecting her age) while [...] "ever on her knees", and gave them forty-one pence each, as well as gifts of bread, fish, and clothing, donating her own gown to <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>said</b> to be poorest of all. [...] In 1572, disliking the scenes as each woman tried to secure {{a piece of the}} royal gown, Queen Elizabeth granted a sum of £1 to each recipient in lieu of the gown, giving it in a red purse. [...] Contemporary writer William Lambarde noted that the money was substituted for the gown [...] "to avoid trouble of suite, which accustomabile was made for that perferment". [...] In years in which plague was rife, the monarch did not attend, sending an official, usually the Lord High Almoner, to make the distributions and perform the pedilavium. [...] Even though scented water was used to disguise any unpleasant odours from the poor, the feet were washed three times before the monarch performed the pedilavium, once by a menial and twice by Court officials. [...] In later years, sweet-smelling nosegays were used to disguise odours—the nosegays are still carried today.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{depiction of}} carnivorous plants {{in popular culture}} was a case wherein a large man-eating tree {{was reported to have}} consumed a young woman in Madagascar in 1878. The South Australian Register carried the story in 1881. It was accompanied by an illustration of the tree consuming <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>said</b> to be a member from the [...] "little known but cruel tribe" [...] called the Mkodos. The story was attributed to a Dr. Carl Liche who supposedly witnessed the event. The account has been debunked as pure myth as it appears Dr. Liche, the Mkodos, and the tree were all fabrications.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{all good}} Nordic lands, Yell has its trolls (known in the Northern Isles as [...] "trows" [...] or [...] "trowes"). The Trow of Windhouse {{was about as}} {{recently}} as the 1880s, when a shipwrecked sailor claimed he had been attacked by the mythical monster. However, the sailor was courageous enough to fight the creature, and saw it off with an axe. It is said that where he killed the trow, the grass turned a light green. This was not the only trow by any means, and there is another story of a Yell woman coming upon a family of trowes, who later woke up to find one in the house, asking who he was, he said [...] "I am Trippa's son". <b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>said</b> a prayer, and the trowe disappeared.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of Operation Anagram (a police {{investigation}} started in 2006 to trace the movements and life of Tobin), a woman {{said she had been}} raped by Tobin after she had met him at the Barrowland Ballroom in Glasgow in 1968, {{around the time of the}} Bible John killings. More than 40 years later, <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>said</b> that her [...] "legs gave way" [...] when she recognised a magazine picture of a young Tobin and came forward after an [...] appeal by the Crimewatch television programme in December 2009. Another woman also came forward in 2010 who claimed to have had a threatening experience at the Barrowland Ballroom. She said that Tobin introduced himself as Peter and pestered her to go with him to a party in the city's Castlemilk area. When she recently saw pictures of a young Tobin, she said: [...] "It was the man who came up to me so many years ago in Barrowlands. I am 100 per cent certain Tobin is Bible John." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the trial, Mark Scarfo {{attempted}} suicide on November 1, 1988. Mark, then only 17 years old, had been taunted for years by classmates about his father's criminal activities. Increasingly despondent over his father's possible imprisonment, Mark Scarfo hanged {{himself in the}} office of his father's concrete supply company in Atlantic City. He was discovered by his mother, and paramedics were able to resuscitate him. He suffered cardiac arrest and his brain was deprived of oxygen. He entered a coma where he remained until his death in April 2014. [...] On November 4, 1988, just three days after Mark's suicide attempt, Nicky Scarfo Jr. and a friend assaulted a woman in an elevator at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia. <b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>said</b> the two men had looked menacingly at her, and she pretended to reach for a gun in her coat. The two men then punched her, pushed her to the floor, and kicked her several times. Scarfo was arrested for assault, convicted, fined, and put on probation for the incident.|$|E
