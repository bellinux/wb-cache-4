In doing so, the reconstruction error is much smaller than that caused by just using the existing initial condition estimation method especially at low SNR. The reason is that: dividing the whole received signal into several small parts enhances the reconstruction accuracy; using the improved SDM decreases the initial condition estimation error in every divided part.|$|R

50|$|Owing to its {{inherent}} {{single carrier}} structure, a prominent advantage of SC-FDMA over OFDM and OFDMA {{is that its}} <b>transmit</b> <b>signal</b> has a lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), resulting in relaxed design parameters in the transmit path of a subscriber unit.

40|$|When <b>transmitting</b> <b>signals,</b> one of {{the most}} {{important}} issues is to keep the transmission errors as low as possible. Or in other words, to obtain a reliable transmission link, the bit-error-rate (BER) should be kept within certain limits. However, the probability of transmission errors strongly depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>signals.</b> Hence, the power amplifier plays a key role in the sender part: the more power, the higher the SNR, the lower the probability of transmission errors. Unfortunately, this is a too simple vision. One should take care to keep the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>signal</b> low in order not to push the power amplifier into its nonlinear operation region. Classical techniques use clipping or backing-off the input signal to reduce the PAPR of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>signal.</b> However, these techniques have a negative influence on the SNR and hence on the BER. In this paper, we present a technique to reduce the PAPR of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>signals</b> and hence to reduce the BER, by introducing errors into Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals in a controlled way. Channel coding will be used to compensate for the introduced errors...|$|R
