The <b>transmitted</b> <b>signal</b> reconstruction in [1] is just using the existing initial condition estimation method. But here, the <b>transmitted</b> <b>signal</b> reconstruction is using PEM. In doing so, the reconstruction error is much smaller than that caused by just using the existing initial condition estimation method especially at low SNR. The reason is that: dividing the whole received signal into several small parts enhances the reconstruction accuracy; using the improved SDM decreases the initial condition estimation error in every divided part.|$|R

50|$|Owing to its {{inherent}} {{single carrier}} structure, a prominent advantage of SC-FDMA over OFDM and OFDMA {{is that its}} <b>transmit</b> <b>signal</b> has a lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), resulting in relaxed design parameters in the transmit path of a subscriber unit. Intuitively, the reason {{lies in the fact}} that where OFDM transmit symbols directly modulate multiple sub-carriers, SC-FDMA transmit symbols are first processed by an N-point DFT block.|$|E

40|$|When <b>transmitting</b> <b>signals,</b> one of {{the most}} {{important}} issues is to keep the transmission errors as low as possible. Or in other words, to obtain a reliable transmission link, the bit-error-rate (BER) should be kept within certain limits. However, the probability of transmission errors strongly depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>signals.</b> Hence, the power amplifier plays a key role in the sender part: the more power, the higher the SNR, the lower the probability of transmission errors. Unfortunately, this is a too simple vision. One should take care to keep the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>signal</b> low in order not to push the power amplifier into its nonlinear operation region. Classical techniques use clipping or backing-off the input signal to reduce the PAPR of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>signal.</b> However, these techniques have a negative influence on the SNR and hence on the BER. In this paper, we present a technique to reduce the PAPR of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>signals</b> and hence to reduce the BER, by introducing errors into Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals in a controlled way. Channel coding will be used to compensate for the introduced errors...|$|R
