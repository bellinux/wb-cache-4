5|$|Each {{episode of}} Quatermass II was telerecorded onto 35mm film during its live transmission, for a {{scheduled}} repeat the following Monday night at 10:15p.m. All six episodes survive intact in the BBC's archives, although the <b>telerecording</b> copies {{in some cases}} suffer from poor quality sound and vision. Owing to either technical or artistic problems, Cartier had some scenes re-performed by the cast immediately following the live performance on the Saturday evening, and these were telerecorded and used to replace the live versions in the Monday night repeats. Quatermass II {{was one of the}} first BBC drama productions to be repeated from a <b>telerecording,</b> rather than having the production re-performed live for any second showing as had been the norm in the past.|$|E
5|$|As was {{the usual}} method of BBC {{television}} drama production at the time, the play was produced in a multi-camera electronic studio on video cameras, although it was recorded as a 35mm film <b>telerecording</b> rather than on videotape. This 35mm master was released for junking in 1968, and no copy of the play is known to exist.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{destruction}} of these masters, BBC Enterprises held a near-complete archive of the series {{in the form of}} their 16mm film <b>telerecording</b> copies until approximately 1972. From around 1972 to 1978, BBC Enterprises also disposed of much of their older material, including many episodes of Doctor Who.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 a few <b>telerecorded</b> clips were discovered.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{unlikely}} {{that any of the}} episodes still exist, as the BBC rarely <b>telerecorded</b> shows prior to the mid-1950s.|$|R
5000|$|Small Faces {{performed}} [...] "Sha-La-La-La-Lee" [...] {{live for}} the Dick Clark show in the United States, <b>telerecorded</b> from the UK.|$|R
5|$|In 1990, the BBC Two arts {{magazine}} programme The Late Show {{produced an}} edition which featured a retrospective of Cartier's work, {{including a new}} interview with the director discussing his career. This feature was repeated on BBC Two under the title Rudolph Cartier: A Television Pioneer on 1 July 1994, followed by a tribute screening of the surviving <b>telerecording</b> copy of the second performance of Nineteen Eighty-Four.|$|E
5|$|In April 2005 BBC Worldwide {{released}} a DVD box set {{of all their}} existing Quatermass material. This included digitally restored versions of all six episodes of Quatermass II, with the sound and vision of the <b>telerecording</b> copies cleaned up as far as possible, {{and some of the}} existing special effects inserts that survived on their original film elements being re-inserted into the episodes.|$|E
5|$|Levine {{alerted the}} new Film and Videotape Library's archive selector, Sue Malden, who paid her own visit to Villiers House and found every {{remaining}} Jon Pertwee episode (albeit as a 16mm black-and-white <b>telerecording),</b> {{except for two}} from his final season: Death to the Daleks and Invasion of the Dinosaurs, Episodes 1.|$|E
50|$|Episode 6 was {{recorded}} using the 625-line system before the official switchover, {{although it was}} <b>telerecorded</b> onto 35mm film, instead of videotape.|$|R
50|$|Some editions {{were made}} (and {{broadcast}} live) in Melbourne, but many {{were made in}} Sydney, and often <b>telerecorded</b> for Melbourne broadcast (see below).|$|R
5000|$|It is {{unlikely}} {{that any of the}} episodes still exist, as the series aired live, and the BBC rarely <b>telerecorded</b> shows prior to 1953.|$|R
5|$|As often {{happened}} in this era, the colour master tapes of The Year of the Sex Olympics were wiped some time after broadcast and the play was believed lost until the 1980s when {{a black and white}} <b>telerecording</b> was discovered. This copy was released on DVD, with an introduction by film and television historian Kim Newman, a commentary by actor Brian Cox and a copy of the original script, by the British Film Institute in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The Film Library's remit covers {{material}} originated on film, not {{on videotape}} – yet {{two of the}} film-originated episodes of Doctor Who (The Power of the Daleks Episode 6 and The Wheel in Space Episode 5) were junked by the Film Library, while it held such unexplained material as 16mm copies of The Tenth Planet Episodes 1–3, presumably viewing prints which were mistakenly returned to them at some point instead of BBC Enterprises. Most surprisingly of all, they also retained a 16mm <b>telerecording</b> copy of the original untransmitted pilot, presumably a viewing print made in 1963 and subsequently lodged at the Library.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, episode 1 of The Mind of Evil {{contains}} no colour information. In principle, BBC engineers {{were supposed to}} filter out the chroma dots upon <b>telerecording,</b> to create a cleaner and nicer picture. In most cases they {{failed to do so}} properly, allowing the colour recovery process to work. For this one episode, the filter had been correctly applied – so there was no colour to recover. To complete the serial for DVD, the episode was manually colourised by Stuart Humphryes and Peter Crocker – thereby returning the final Pertwee episode to its original colour presentation.|$|E
50|$|The 1949 version {{aired on}} BBC, and {{starring}} Marius Goring, Ivan Craig and Josée Richard. Broadcast live, {{it was likely}} never <b>telerecorded,</b> and is lost.|$|R
50|$|The {{series was}} {{broadcast}} {{live with the}} exception of the episode of 18 July, which was <b>telerecorded.</b> None of the episodes are known to have survived.|$|R
50|$|It {{was based}} on Travers' play Rookery Nook, one of the Aldwych Farces, and is {{believed}} not to have <b>telerecorded</b> as it was transmitted and is therefore lost.|$|R
5|$|For the box set release, Quatermass and the Pit was {{extensively}} restored. A {{process called}} VidFIRE {{was applied to}} all of the scenes originally broadcast live, restoring the fluid interlaced video look they would have had on transmission, but which was lost during the <b>telerecording</b> process. For the pre-filmed scenes, most of the high-quality original 35mm film inserts still existed, as they had been spliced into the 1959–60 compilation repeat version in place of the lower-quality telerecorded versions of the same sequences. As this compilation also survived in the BBC archives, these film sequences were able to be digitally remastered and inserted into the newly restored episodic version for the DVD release. The compilation used a separate magnetic soundtrack, and although the original had decayed a safety copy had survived. This yielded better sound quality than the optical soundtracks accompanying the original episodes, and was therefore the main source for the audio remastering except in the case of scenes that were not in the compilation, and in a few cases where faults on the magnetic tracks necessitated their replacement by the optical versions.|$|E
25|$|BBC2, 3 August 1977, {{repeat of}} 16 December 1954 <b>telerecording.</b>|$|E

50|$|Some colour {{productions}} were <b>telerecorded</b> onto monochrome {{film for}} export to countries {{which did not}} yet have colour television. In some cases, early colour programmes only survive in this form.|$|R
50|$|Two episodes were {{returned}} in 2004 after {{turning up in}} a private collection. Colour episodes from the early 1970s {{are less likely to}} be recovered, as they were never <b>telerecorded</b> for export.|$|R
5000|$|Competition in the {{time-slot}} {{consisted of}} feature films on HSV-7 and varying programs on ABV-2 (depending on the week, this {{ranged from a}} feature film, live variety, <b>telerecorded</b> variety, a documentary, and even swimming coverage).|$|R
25|$|BBC Two, 1 July 1994, {{repeat of}} 16 December 1954 <b>telerecording,</b> commemorating {{the death of}} Rudolph Cartier.|$|E
25|$|Both {{performances}} were broadcast live. A <b>telerecording</b> of the 1954 performance was broadcast on Christmas Eve 1956 but this recording {{seems to have}} been discarded.|$|E
25|$|The second {{production}} was broadcast on December 24, 1959. This version exists as a 35mm <b>telerecording</b> in the BBC Archives. This version was again produced by Christian Simpson and starred Christopher Nicholls as Amahl and Elsie Morison as Amahl's mother. This time music {{was provided by}} the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.|$|E
50|$|The 1953 version also {{aired on}} the BBC, {{and was an}} episode of Wednesday Theatre. It {{featured}} Robert Helpmann and Harold Lang. This version is likely lost, as the BBC rarely <b>telerecorded</b> shows during 1953.|$|R
5|$|Several early 1970s colour serials, {{starring}} Jon Pertwee, {{were retained}} only as black-and-white film prints. In {{addition to the}} motion issue shared by all <b>telerecorded</b> episodes, for years the loss of colour presented a major challenge for restoration.|$|R
5000|$|The Madhouse on Castle Street, a 1963 BBC teleplay {{starring}} a then-unknown Bob Dylan, {{is considered}} lost. It was erased in 1968, and despite {{attempts by the}} British Film Institute to recover it, a <b>telerecorded</b> copy has still not been found [...]|$|R
25|$|The {{first two}} series were {{recorded}} and screened {{in black and}} white, while Series 3 to 9 were recorded and screened in colour. Even so, one episode in Series 3, Room at the Bottom, formerly only survived {{in black and white}} and remains on the official DVDs in this form. This episode has benefited from colour recovery technology, using a buried colour signal (chroma dots) in the black-and-white <b>telerecording</b> to restore the episode back to colour and was transmitted on 13 December 2008 on BBC Two.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of television, the ABC had been using Lissajous figures as fillers {{in-between}} programs. A staff competition was conducted in 1963 to create a new logo for use on television, stationery, publications, microphone badges and ABC vehicles. Graphic designer, Bill Kennard, who had been experimenting with <b>telerecording</b> of the Cathode Ray Oscillograph displays, submitted a design in 1965 which was part of the waveform of an oscilloscope. The letters A-B-C were added to the wavelength design and it was adopted as the ABC's official logo. Mr Kennard was paid twenty five pounds for his design.|$|E

50|$|Women's Viewpoint was a British {{television}} series which aired on the BBC during 1951. It was a discussion programme in which issues were discussed by women. It is unlikely {{any of the}} episodes still exist, given that the BBC rarely <b>telerecorded</b> shows prior to 1953.|$|R
50|$|Don't Spare the Horses was a British {{television}} {{comedy series}} which aired on the BBC during 1952. It featured Jimmy James, Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers, and Spike Milligan. It aired live for three episodes. These live transmissions were not recorded, as the BBC very rarely <b>telerecorded</b> shows {{prior to the}} mid-1950s.|$|R
50|$|The {{play was}} written by Raymond Bowers, an Australian living in London. Scenes were shot on Sydney's North Shore, the Cahill Expressway, a Sydney beach, and the Harbour Bridge. It was <b>telerecorded</b> and later show in London by Associated Radifusion. It {{was the first of}} a series of {{exchange}} programs between the ABC and the British television company.|$|R
