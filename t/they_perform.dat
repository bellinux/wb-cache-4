5|$|This teleonomy is {{the quality}} whereby the process of natural {{selection}} creates and preserves traits that are seemingly fitted for the functional roles <b>they</b> <b>perform.</b> The processes by which the changes occur, {{from one generation to}} another, are called evolutionary processes or mechanisms.

Natural selection and genetic drift sort variation; mutation and gene migration create variation.|$|E
5|$|Ambulance Driver – Some {{services}} employ {{staff with}} no medical qualification (or just a first aid certificate) {{whose job is}} to simply drive the patients from place to place.

In some areas, these drivers would survey and study the local network of routes for better performance of service, as some road routes may be blocked, and the driver must know another route to the patient or to the hospital. The driver would gather the local weather and traffic status reports before and in-between emergencies. They may also have training in using the radio and knowing where medical supplies are stored in the ambulance.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the male}} and female of the species reach sexual {{maturity}} after 1 year of life. The breeding season occurs in the spring and early summer.

5|$|Data {{is written}} to the flash memory in units called pages (made up of {{multiple}} cells). However, the memory can be erased only in larger units called blocks (made up of multiple pages). If the data {{in some of the}} pages of the block are no longer needed (also called stale pages), only the pages with good data in that block are read and rewritten into another previously erased empty block. Then the free pages left by not moving the stale data are available for new data. This is a process called garbage collection (GC). All SSDs include some level of garbage collection, but they may differ in when and how fast <b>they</b> <b>perform</b> the process. Garbage collection {{is a big part of}} write amplification on the SSD.|$|E
