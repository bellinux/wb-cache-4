25|$|On 10 November 2013, an MU-2-2B-25 {{crashed in}} woods near Owasso, Oklahoma. Dr. Perry Inhofe, the solo occupant, was killed. He was {{a son of}} Senator Jim Inhofe, a Senior Republican Senator from Oklahoma. The NTSB factual report states that Inhofe had no {{previous}} experience flying <b>turbine-powered</b> <b>aircraft,</b> {{and that this was}} his first solo flight after completing 11.5 hours of training. A subsequent lawsuit filed by his family alleged that one of the aircraft's engines failed just as Dr. Inhofe was attempting to make his first-ever solo landing in an MU-2.|$|E
25|$|A <b>turbine-powered</b> <b>aircraft's</b> takeoff {{procedure}} is designed around ensuring that an engine failure will not endanger the flight. This {{is done by}} planning the takeoff around three critical V speeds, V1, VR and V2. V1 is the critical engine failure recognition speed, {{the speed at which}} a takeoff can be continued with an engine failure, and the speed at which stopping distance is no longer guaranteed {{in the event of a}} rejected takeoff. VR is the speed at which the nose is lifted off the runway, a process known as rotation. V2 is the single-engine safety speed, the single engine climb speed. The use of these speeds ensure that either sufficient thrust to continue the takeoff, or sufficient stopping distance to reject it will be available at all times.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of their}} lower {{efficiency}} and larger bulk, air cycle coolers are not often used nowadays in terrestrial cooling devices. However, the {{air cycle machine}} is very common on gas <b>turbine-powered</b> jet <b>aircraft</b> as cooling and ventilation units, because compressed air is readily available from the engines' compressor sections. Such units also serve the purpose of pressurizing the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|On 25 June 1945, the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) asked Douglas <b>Aircraft</b> for a <b>turbine-powered,</b> propeller-driven <b>aircraft.</b> Three {{proposals}} were put {{forth in the}} next year and a half: the D-557A, to use two General Electric TG-100s (T31s) in wing nacelles; the D-557B, the same engine, with counter-rotating propellers; and the D-557C, to use the Westinghouse 25D. These were canceled, due to engine development difficulties, but BuAer continued to seek an answer to thirsty jets.|$|R
25|$|Early flight trials, however, {{showed the}} qualities of a turboprop, {{resulting}} in a February 1949 order from the Ministry of Supply for a prototype of a stretched version with more powerful engines, the Type 700. Meanwhile, the first prototype Type 630 was awarded a restricted Certificate of Airworthiness on 15 September 1949, followed by a full certificate on 27 July 1950, which allowed the aircraft to be placed into trial service with BEA on 29 July to familiarise the pilots and ground crew with the new aircraft. It flew scheduled flights between London and Paris, and London and Edinburgh until 23 August 1950. 29 July 1950 flight between Northolt and Paris – Le Bourget Airport with 14 paying passengers was the first scheduled airline flight by any <b>turbine-powered</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
25|$|Turbine {{engines in}} use on today’s <b>turbine-powered</b> <b>aircraft</b> are very reliable. Engines operate {{efficiently}} with regularly scheduled inspections and maintenance. These units can have lives ranging {{in the thousands}} of hours of operation. However, engine malfunctions or failures occasionally occur that require an engine {{to be shut down}} in flight. Since multi-engine airplanes are designed to fly with one engine inoperative and flight crews are trained to fly with one engine inoperative, the in-flight shutdown of an engine typically does not constitute a serious safety of flight issue. Following an engine shutdown, a precautionary landing is usually performed with airport fire and rescue equipment positioned near the runway. Once the airplane lands, fire department personnel assist with inspecting the airplane to ensure it is safe before it taxis to its parking position. Turboprop-powered aircraft and turboshaft-powered helicopters are also powered by turbine engines and are subject to engine failures for many similar reasons as jet-powered aircraft. In the case of an engine failure in a helicopter, it is often possible for the pilot to enter autorotation, using the unpowered rotor to slow the aircraft's descent and provide a measure of control, usually allowing for a safe emergency landing even without engine power.|$|E

50|$|Staggerwing {{production}} {{ended in}} 1946, replaced by general aviation's first successful, fully modern light aircraft, the V-tailed, four-seat, single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza. Approximately 750 were built {{and sold in}} the first year, despite a recession and a devastating aviation industry shakeout. In various forms, the Bonanza has now become the world's longest continuously produced aircraft, still in production in a straight-tailed, six-seat version. Other models evolved from the Bonanza, ultimately culminating in the twin-turboprop Beechcraft King Air and Beechcraft Super King Air, the world's most popular <b>turbine-powered</b> business <b>aircraft.</b> The Beech line added imported business jets from Britain and Japan, a military trainer from Switzerland, and also produced military drones.|$|R
50|$|The Airborne {{wind shear}} {{detection}} and alert system, fitted in an aircraft, detects and alerts the pilot both visually and aurally of a wind shear condition. In case of reactive wind shear detection system, the detection takes place when the aircraft penetrates a wind shear condition of sufficient force, which can pose a hazard to the aircraft. In case of predictive wind shear detection system, the detection takes place, if such wind shear condition {{is ahead of}} the aircraft. In 1988 the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandated that all <b>turbine-powered</b> commercial <b>aircraft</b> must have on-board windshear detection systems by 1993. Airlines successfully lobbied to have commercial turbo-prop aircraft exempted from this requirement.|$|R

The significance of disk loading in V/STOL concept application is discussed, and preliminary design configuration studies for three different business-aircraft-sized V/STOLs, using three concepts covering a range of disk loading, are presented as examples. Finally, a discussion of operational aspects of interest to future users of V/STOL business aircraft is presented which centers around the requirements for routine IFR terminal-area operations...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} more birds collide with communication towers equipped with red warning lights than with towers equipped with lights of shorter wavelengths. We used the U.

Federal Aviation Administration’s National Wildlife Strike Database {{to determine if a}} similar relationship exists for <b>turbine-powered</b> jet <b>aircraft</b> with 2 underwing- or fuselage-mounted engines and bird strikes. We compared bird strikes reported to engine # 1 (left side = red lighting) or to engine # 2 (right side = green lighting) using chi-square tests (α = 0. 05). For both underwing- and fuselage-mounted engines, more (P ≤ 0. 04) strikes were reported for engine # 1 compared to engine # 2 during Day, Night, and Dawn/Dusk flights. These findings suggest that modifying red navigation lights to include shorter wavelengths and the use of supplemental lights specifically designed for avian vision could enhance detection and reduce bird strikes...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of ice on wings and other control surfaces of airplanes {{is one of}} the oldest and most vexing problems that aircraft engineers and scientists continue to face. While no easy, comprehensive answers exist, the staff at NASAs Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) at the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland has done pioneering work to make flight safer for experimental, commercial, and military customers. The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) initiated government research on aircraft icing in the 1930 s at its Langley facility in Virginia. Icing research shifted to the NACA's Cleveland facility in the 1940 s. Initially there was little focus on icing at either location, as these facilities were more concerned with aerodynamics and engine development. With several high-profile fatal crashes of air mail carriers, however, the NACA soon realized the need for a leading research facility devoted to icing prevention and removal. The IRT began operation in 1944 and, despite renovations and periodic attempts to shut it down, has continued to function productively for almost 60 years. In part because icing has proved so problematic over time, IRT researchers have been unusually open-minded in experimenting with a wide variety of substances, devices, and techniques. Early icing prevention experiments involved grease, pumping hot engine exhaust onto the wings, glycerin soap, mechanical and inflatable "boots," and even corn syrup. The IRT staff also looked abroad for ideas and later tried a German and Soviet technique of electromagnetism, to no avail. More recently, European polymer fluids have been more promising. The IRT even periodically had "amateur nights" in which a dentist's coating for children's teeth proved unequal to the demands of super-cooled water droplets blown at 100 miles per hour. Despite many research dead-ends, IRT researchers have achieved great success over the years. They have developed important computer models, such as the LEWICE software, and made significant contributions to prevent ice buildup on <b>turbine-powered</b> commercial <b>aircraft,</b> helicopters, and military planes...|$|R

50|$|Air {{has been}} used for residential, automobile, and <b>turbine-powered</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{air-conditioning}} and/or cooling. The reason why air is not more widely used as a general-purpose refrigerant is because there is no change of phase, and is therefore too inefficient to be practical in most applications. It has been suggested that with suitable compression and expansion technology, air can be a practical (albeit not the most efficient) refrigerant, free of the possibility of environmental contamination or damage, and almost completely harmless to plants and animals.|$|E
