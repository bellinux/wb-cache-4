5|$|Members of the red-breasted {{nuthatch}} superspecies excavate their own tree holes, although most other nuthatches use natural holes or old woodpecker nests. Several species {{reduce the size}} of <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> hole and seal up cracks with mud. The {{red-breasted nuthatch}} makes the nest secure by daubing sticky conifer resin globules around <b>the</b> <b>entrance,</b> the male applying the resin outside and the female inside. The resin may deter predators or competitors (the resident birds avoid the resin by diving straight through <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> hole). The white-breasted nuthatch smears blister beetles around <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities.|$|E

5|$|Next to the apse is a {{mural of}} Saint Cyril of Alexandria, captioned as “Saint Cyril the Philosopher”, the 9th-century missionary to the Slavs. Although the {{position}} and iconography of the portrait clearly identify it as an image of Cyril of Alexandria, the caption hints that the local population confused the two saints and Cyril the Philosopher was still well-remembered at the time. Other images painted in the church include these of the Dormition of the Mother of God (above <b>the</b> <b>entrance),</b> the Transfiguration of Jesus (under the vault), John Damascene, Cosmas of Maiuma, Archangel Michael (south of <b>the</b> <b>entrance),</b> Saint Constantine and Saint Helena (right of <b>the</b> <b>entrance).</b>|$|E

5|$|A few {{accounts}} {{exist that}} describe females defending their newborn litters. Wharten (1960, 1966) reported several cases where females found near their young stood their ground and considered these to be examples of guarding behavior.

50|$|During {{the early}} {{period of the}} Moreton Bay penal settlement, vessels entered Moreton Bay {{primarily}} through <b>the</b> South <b>Entrance,</b> which was <b>the</b> passage between Moreton and North Stradbroke Islands.

Despite the hazards however, <b>the</b> southern <b>entrance</b> remained <b>the</b> main <b>entrance</b> to <b>the</b> Moreton Bay settlement as it better suited <b>the</b> colony, <b>the</b> <b>entrances</b> were already marked, and the pilot station was already established at Amity Point.|$|R

5|$|After {{the ride}} was renovated in 1990, a new space theme was given. The {{story of the}} ride was the {{passengers}} had been to deliver cargo from a suborbital factory to a station in Alaska. Large screen projections, simulated lasers, mist, and recordings {{were added to the}} ride. In the queue, guests would go through three rooms including Rocket Recovery, Mission Control and Repair Bay. The original entrance to the ride was located next to Troika. During HalloWeekends, the park would change <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> of Disaster Transport to under the lift hill, leaving the one next to Troika to be used for the Halloween Haunt. For the 2009 season, <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> was permanently changed to under the lift hill.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1857, {{the need for}} a {{lighthouse}} on Point Stephens was identified, due to the proximity to <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> of Port Stephens, and the dangers of the local coastline to ships. Another reason was that mariners were mistaking <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> to Fingal Bay for that of Port Stephens. At least twenty four vessels are known to have been wrecked in the area. the most serious being the Dove in 1828 with the loss of seven lives, and the Pandora in 1836 with five lives. Another notable wreck was the Florence Irving in 1877.|$|E
