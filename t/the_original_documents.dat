5|$|At that point, a {{group of}} aristocrats persuaded the Despot Andronikos to seek the {{assistance}} of the Republic of Venice, an initiative probably taken without consulting Constantinople. In spring 1423, via the Venetian colony of Negroponte, he informed the Venetians of his intention. The only conditions Andronikos attached to his offer were that the property, customs and privileges of the city's inhabitants, their right to trade and come and go freely, and the position of the city's Orthodox Church, were respected, and that Venice would pledge to defend the city against the Ottomans. Pseudo-Sphrantzes claims that Andronikos sold the city for 50,000 ducats, and this statement was often accepted by more recent scholars until the mid-20th century. However, this is not mentioned by any other source, nor is it found in <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>documents</b> pertaining to the affair, as shown by the scholars Konstantinos Mertzios and Paul Lemerle. On the other hand, the Venetian envoys appointed to oversee the handover were authorised to provide a sum of between 20,000 and 40,000 aspers from the revenue of the city as a yearly subsidy to Andronikos, should he request it.|$|E

25|$|After {{the revelation}} about the affidavit, {{a series of}} grand jury {{investigations}} were begun into the cover-up activities of Jefferson County officials. The investigation revealed that high-ranking county officials had met {{a few days after}} the massacre to discuss the release of the affidavit to the public. It was decided that because the affidavit's contents lacked the necessary probable cause to have supported the issuance of a search warrant for the Harris household by a judge, it would be best not to disclose the affidavit's existence at an upcoming press conference, although the actual conversations and points of discussion were never revealed to anyone other than the grand jury members. Following the press conference, the original Guerra documents disappeared. In September 1999, a Jefferson County investigator failed to find the documents during a secret search of the county's computer system. A second attempt in late 2000 found copies of the document within the Jefferson County archives. The documents were reconstructed and released to the public in September 2001, but <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>documents</b> are still missing.

500|$|In 1902, Edson S. Jones, a {{descendant}} of Thomas Arnold of Watertown and Providence mentioned earlier, visited England in search of records pertaining to his family. [...] Thinking that Thomas Arnold was connected with William Arnold (which, it turned out, he was not), he visited Northover and Ilchester, finding the original parish registers, {{as well as other}} important source documents. [...] He discovered that every entry in the Arnold record that could be compared with entries in the parish registers matched perfectly. [...] He also discovered that the Somerby pedigree of the Arnold family had serious discrepancies with original documents. [...] As he checked the source documents from which Somerby supposedly compiled the pedigree, he found that some of the generations in the Somerby pedigree had been shuffled from <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>documents,</b> some members of the lineage came from unrelated families, and some place names seemed to have been totally made up. [...] It had earlier been believed that a Thomas Arnold was the father of William Arnold, and Somerby stated that this Thomas Arnold came from a place called Northover near Cheselbourne in County Dorset. [...] No such place exists. [...] The Somerby pedigree of the Arnold family published in 1879 was riddled with misinformation, and it had been accepted as fact for over three decades by even prominent genealogists such as John Osborne Austin. [...] Fred Arnold wrote in 1921, [...] "The most regrettable feature in Somerby's work is, that {{in the absence of any}} English record, known here to disprove it, so reliable a genealogist as Mr. John O. Austin was led to accept and use it in his dictionary, although neither give any record evidence. [...] Very rarely has Mr. Austin accepted another's statement, unless he has himself seen evidence to support it." [...] This fabricated research was not an isolated incident; Mr. Somerby had also been implicated in other fraudulent research and was out to please his clients regardless of the veracity of his work.|$|E
