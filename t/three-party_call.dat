50|$|The {{basic form}} of CTC (Request-a-Call) {{technology}} currently in general use is {{just exactly what}} Request-a-Call sounds like: an end user enters her phone number through a web dialog box, then an intermediary service calls both that end user and the merchant or other respective third party, and connects the two together for an ordinary telephone conversation. It is instructive {{to think of this}} implementation as the familiar <b>three-party</b> <b>call,</b> or conference call. The user wants to talk to a website representative, so the CTC provider calls the user and the representative and then bridges the call between them in one way or another. As to cost, typically the website operator or its client pays for CTC services. It is comparatively rare for a consumer to be charged for CTC services in typical web commerce, except of course in designedly pay-per-call implementations, as may be found on adult websites or other sites with business models involving payment for media presentation. Regardless of who pays, three way calls are more expensive than 2 way calls, so the most cost effective CTC providers drop off after the desired connection is made, preventing pass through of any 3-way call charges.|$|E

30|$|Authenticated key {{exchange}} protocols {{are important}} and have been widely applied in network communication. By a pre-registration, two communication parties share a secret symmetric key with a trusted server correspondingly. When the two participants try to exchange any information with authentication property confidentially in an insecure environment, they must be in agreement on a new secret session key by {{the help of a}} server. This kind of key exchange method is <b>called</b> <b>three-party</b> authenticated key exchange (3 PAKE), and the 3 PAKE protocols typically are employed for mutual authentication and secure communication in various applications.|$|R
50|$|In 1920 the RSFSR by {{agreement}} with the communists, social revolutionists and social democrats formed a <b>three-party</b> coalition government <b>called</b> the Far Eastern Republic (F.E.R.). The Chairman of the F.E.R. was Alexander Krasnochekoff. In September 1920 this government ordered its Central Postal Administration to collect all stocks of the remaining Tsarist postage stamps from all post offices {{in the area of}} the F.E.R. Large supplies of the Imperial Russian 1909-1917 'Arms' issue were on hand at the main post office of Khabarovsk and also at Vladivostok. At first mail was franked with these 'Arms' stamps and the still current Kolchak (Siberia) overprinted stamps. This introduced the danger of revenue loss due to imported 'Arms' stamps. The decision was hence made to overprint all the 'Arms' stamps with the Russian initials 'DBP' meaning Far Eastern Republic (Dalne-Vostochnaya Respublika), and to accept only these for franking within the F.E.R. It remains uncertain what the exact issue date was; sources mention November 23 as well as December 12, 1920.|$|R
