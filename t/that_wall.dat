25|$|From 1850 to 1890, {{city limits}} in the West and the South mainly {{followed}} another wall called Linienwall {{at which a}} road toll called the Liniengeld was charged. Outside this wall from 1873 onwards a ring road called Gürtel was built. In 1890 {{it was decided to}} integrate 33 suburbs (called Vororte) beyond <b>that</b> <b>wall</b> into Vienna by 1 January 1892 and transform them into districts no. 11 to 19 (district no. 10 had been constituted in 1874); hence the Linienwall was torn down beginning in 1894.

The 52-50 vote established the Provisional Government of Oregon that would last until the Oregon Territory's government superseded it in 1849.

The south wall of his house marked the boundary line between the Yamhill and Champooick districts, and though the house is no longer standing, the location of <b>that</b> <b>wall</b> currently marks the line between Yamhill and Polk counties.

25|$|Byrne {{initiated}} a Dutch auction IPO of Overstock.com in 2002. The company {{was one of}} the first to go public under a system advanced by WR Hambrecht + Co to retain a greater share of capital within the company rather than going to the investment bank underwriters used in conventional public offerings. Byrne has said that competing banks reacted against this, attempting to obstruct the success of the offering through negative reports and by shorting the company's stock. When Google later in 2004 went public via a Dutch auction IPO, Byrne commented <b>that</b> <b>Wall</b> Street firms similarly pushed negative stories, but did not keep it from going forward successfully. Four years after the OpenIPO, one official of Hambrecht, its now former co-CEO Clay Corbus was added to Overstock's board of directors.|$|E

25|$|The Great Wall of China is {{a series}} of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, {{generally}} built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were being built as early as the 7th centuryBC; these, later joined together and made bigger and stronger, are collectively referred to as the Great Wall. Especially famous is the system of fortifications built in 220–206BC by Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. Little of <b>that</b> <b>wall</b> remains. The Great Wall has been rebuilt, maintained, and enhanced over various dynasties; the majority of the existing wall is from the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644).|$|E
25|$|Brock {{made his}} major league debut with the Cubs on September 10, 1961, {{at the age}} of 22. In his rookie season of 1962, Brock became one of four players to hit a home run into the center-field bleachers at the old Polo Grounds in New York since its 1923 reconstruction. His blast came against Al Jackson in the first game of a June 17 doubleheader against the New York Mets and was one of two that would clear the wall in {{consecutive}} days, with Hank Aaron's coming the very next day. Joe Adcock was the first to hit a ball over <b>that</b> <b>wall,</b> in 1953. Babe Ruth reached the old bleachers (a comparable distance) before the reconstruction. Brock was not known as a power hitter, but he did display significant power from time to time.|$|E
25|$|Alternative {{methods of}} rupture {{assessment}} have been recently reported. The {{majority of these}} approaches involve the numerical analysis of AAAs using the common engineering technique of the finite element method (FEM) to determine the wall stress distributions. Recent reports have shown that these stress distributions {{have been shown to}} correlate to the overall geometry of the AAA rather than solely to the maximum diameter. It is also known <b>that</b> <b>wall</b> stress alone does not completely govern failure as an AAA will usually rupture when the wall stress exceeds the wall strength. In light of this, rupture assessment may be more accurate if both the patient-specific wall stress is coupled together with patient-specific wall strength. A non-invasive method of determining patient-dependent wall strength was recently reported, with more traditional approaches to strength determination via tensile testing performed by other researchers in the field. Some of the more recently proposed AAA rupture-risk assessment methods include: AAA wall stress; AAA expansion rate; degree of asymmetry; presence of intraluminal thrombus (ILT); a rupture potential index (RPI); a finite element analysis rupture index (FEARI); biomechanical factors coupled with computer analysis; growth of ILT; geometrical parameters of the AAA; and also a method of determining AAA growth and rupture based on mathematical models.|$|E
