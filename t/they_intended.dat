5|$|On 31 July, Contador's agent {{announced}} that Contador had {{turned down an}} offer to remain with Astana under a new four-year contract because he had felt uncomfortable being caught between the Kazakhs {{on one side and}} Bruyneel on the other, and he was hoping to leave Astana before his contract expired in 2010. However, on 11 August, Contador's close friend Sergio Paulinho accepted a two-year contract with Team RadioShack, indicating that Contador {{might not be able to}} leave Astana as he and his agent wished. This was confirmed on 15 August, when a spokesperson for the Kazakh sponsors of Astana said that <b>they</b> <b>intended</b> to sponsor the Astana team on the UCI ProTour through 2013 and that <b>they</b> <b>intended</b> to enforce the last year of Contador's contract with Astana in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Remedy planned Bright Falls as a free-roaming, sandbox-style open world city, {{similar to}} those seen in the Grand Theft Auto series.

5|$|Ahead of the 2011 season, NFF and NTF {{stated that}} Superfinalen would be discontinued, {{stating that the}} {{championship}} was interesting neither from a sports nor from a commercial aspect. However, the two would-be qualified teams, league winner Rosenborg and cup winner Strømsgodset, were free to play a pre-season friendly, although {{it would not be}} regarded as an official match. Rosenborg has traditionally played its final pre-season game against Viking and stated that <b>they</b> <b>intended</b> to take up that tradition following the abandoning of Superfinalen.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 73 BC, Spartacus and Crixus were {{in command}} of {{a large group of}} armed men with a proven ability to {{withstand}} Roman armies. What <b>they</b> <b>intended</b> to do with this force is somewhat difficult for modern readers to determine. Since the Third Servile War was ultimately an unsuccessful rebellion, no firsthand account of the slaves' motives and goals exists, and historians writing about the war propose contradictory theories.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{a popular}} protest flag, {{the leaders of}} the Umbrella Movement {{requested}} that participants of the movement not use the flag, as <b>they</b> <b>intended</b> to protest without intentionally provoking Chinese authorities or the Hong Kong Police Force. The flag has also been used outside of Hong Kong; in the United Kingdom, the blue ensign {{has been used as a}} symbol of protest to pressure the government of the United Kingdom to ensure the Sino-British Joint Declaration is fulfilled.|$|E

5|$|Hester {{began his}} {{professional}} {{career in the}} National Football League with the Chicago Bears, who selected him {{in the second round}} of the 2006 NFL Draft with the 57th overall pick. The team originally drafted Hester as a cornerback, but <b>they</b> <b>intended</b> to play him as a return specialist, following the retirement of Jerry Azumah, and departure of Bobby Wade. The team's decision to draft Hester was initially criticized by fans and sports analysts, who believed the Bears should have spent their early picks on offensive prospects.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore, {{attempted}} suicide, abetment of suicide, and abetment {{of attempted}} suicide are criminal acts. This applies to physicians who aid patients in ending their lives. Such physicians {{are unable to}} claim a defence under section 88 of the Penal Code since <b>they</b> <b>intended</b> to cause the patients' deaths. However, physicians are absolved of liability if patients refuse treatment for terminal illnesses by issuing advance medical directives.|$|E

5|$|Poedjangga Baroe {{was closed}} {{with the fall}} of the Dutch East Indies {{government}} after the Japanese invaded the Indies in February 1942; the last issue published covered the period of December 1941 to February 1942. The editors wrote in that issue that <b>they</b> <b>intended</b> to continue publication as long as feasible; this did not happen, although later writers used a similar style. Until its closing, the original run of Poedjangga Baroe published about ninety issues.|$|E
5|$|Sons of Soul was {{produced}} entirely by the group, {{who worked with}} various session musicians and utilized both vintage and contemporary recording equipment. <b>They</b> <b>intended</b> {{to pay homage to}} their musical influences—classic soul artists of the 1960s and 1970s—and incorporated live instrumentation, funk, and hip hop elements such as samples and scratches. Lead singer and bassist Raphael Wiggins handled most of the songwriting, which featured quirky, flirtatious lyrics.|$|E

5|$|The year of Ali's {{ascension}} {{also saw}} {{the signing of the}} Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty between Britain and Germany. This treaty officially demarcated the spheres of interest in East Africa and ceded Germany's rights in Zanzibar to the United Kingdom. This granted the British government more influence in Zanzibar, which <b>they</b> <b>intended</b> to use to eradicate slavery there, an objective they had held as early as 1804.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the series}} fictionalises {{the world of}} MI5, several storylines are based on truth. The series had advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The writers also {{research}} heavily on each episode. The producers were keen in world events that Britain and America were directly or indirectly responsible for, where the consequences of an operation are worse than what <b>they</b> <b>intended</b> to resolve in the first place, known as blowback. One example includes the two powers aiding the Afghan Mujahideen in 1989 before {{pulling out of the}} country; this ultimately lead to the rise of Al-Qaeda.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} Iraqi column {{crossed the}} Saudi border to the East, although still along the coast, towards {{the city of}} Khafji. These Iraqi tanks were screened by the 5th Mechanized Battalion of the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade. This battalion withdrew when it came under heavy fire, {{as it had been}} ordered to not engage the Iraqi column. Elements of the 8th and 10th Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigades also conducted similar screening operations. Due to the order to not engage, the road to Khafji was left open. At one point, Iraqi T-55s of another column rolled up to the Saudi border, signaling that <b>they</b> <b>intended</b> to surrender. As they were approached by Saudi Arabian troops, they reversed their turrets and opened fire. This prompted air support from a nearby AC-130, destroying 13 vehicles.|$|E

5|$|An initial {{meeting on}} May 30 nearly ended in disaster. Waite and several local civic leaders called union {{president}} Calderwood and mine owners Hagerman and Moffat {{to a conference}} in a meeting hall {{on the campus of}} Colorado College in Colorado Springs. Talks were under way and proceeding well when a mob of local citizens attempted to storm the building. Blaming Calderwood and Waite for the violence in Cripple Creek, <b>they</b> <b>intended</b> to lynch both men. As a local judge distracted the mob, Calderwood and Waite escaped out a rear door and onto the governor's waiting train.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of these}} works, the Peddars Way was redirected. It had {{previously}} run straight across the de Warenne estates, but it was now diverted so that travellers coming from the south {{had to leave the}} main road, progress west around the priory and the castle fishpond, before reaching {{the southern end of the}} walled town and the route to the north. If <b>they</b> <b>intended</b> to enter the castle, they would have needed to enter through the town's western gate, then the castle's gatehouse, before probably passing through a ceremonial sequence of rooms in order to finally meet the lord. The route was designed to highlight the important symbols of the de Warenne lordship of the region and provide a dramatic view of the castle, and may have been a response to the political uncertainties of the Anarchy years.|$|E
5|$|By 1944, Skelton {{was engaged}} to actress Muriel Morris, who was also known as Muriel Chase; the couple had {{obtained}} a marriage license and told the press <b>they</b> <b>intended</b> to marry within a few days.

She later recanted the story about marrying the businessman, but continued to say that her relationship with Skelton was over. The actress further denied {{that the reason for}} the breakup was Edna's continuing to manage her ex-husband's career; Edna stated that she had no intention of either getting {{in the middle of the}} relationship or reconciling with her former husband.|$|E
