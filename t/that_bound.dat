All legends that were attributed to Kartikeya were also attributed to Murukan. The syncretic deity has six major temples in Tamil Nadu and countless many other smaller temples. Legends developed <b>that</b> <b>bound</b> the worship of syncretic Skanda-Murukan to Tamil Nadu as a god of the Tamils. It included his marriage of Valli from Toṇṭaināṭu.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the cathedral}} began in about 1175, {{to the design of}} an unknown architect. Wells is the first cathedral in England to be, from its foundation, built in the Gothic style. According to art {{historian}} John Harvey, it is the first truly Gothic cathedral in the world, its architects having entirely dispensed with all the features <b>that</b> <b>bound</b> the contemporary east end of Canterbury Cathedral and the earlier buildings of France, such as the east end of the Abbey of Saint Denis, to the Romanesque. Unlike these churches, Wells has clustered piers rather than columns and has a gallery of identical pointed arches rather than the typically Romanesque form of paired openings. The style, with its simple untraceried lancet arches and convoluted mouldings, is known as Early English Gothic.|$|E
5|$|On December 12, 2001, Ryder {{was arrested}} on {{shoplifting}} charges in Beverly Hills, California. She was accused of stealing $5,500 worth of designer clothes and accessories at a Saks Fifth Avenue department store. In the security offices of the store, before Ryder was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department, she signed two civil demands <b>that</b> <b>bound</b> her {{to pay for the}} stolen and surrendered merchandise, as permitted under California's Statute for Civil Recovery for Shoplifting. Los Angeles District Attorney Stephen Cooley produced a team of eight prosecutors, and filed four felony charges against her. Ryder hired noted celebrity defense attorney Mark Geragos. Negotiations for a plea bargain failed at the end of summer 2002. As noted by Joel Mowbray from National Review, the prosecution was not ready to offer the actress an open door to a no-contest plea on misdemeanor charges.|$|E

5|$|Seeds of Evil {{begins with}} the new Turok, Joshua Fireseed, {{appearing}} through a portal to face a female alien named Adon. She explains he has been called by the Elders of the Lost Land, the Lazarus Concordance, to defeat the Primagen, a powerful alien entity that was imprisoned in the wreckage of his own Lightship after attempting to witness {{the creation of the}} universe. This incident {{led to the creation of}} the Lost Land, a bizarre and barbarian world where time has no meaning. Awakened by the events of Dinosaur Hunter, the Primagen mobilizes several races of primitive creatures from the Lost Land to destroy five Energy Totems, powerful devices <b>that</b> <b>bound</b> the Primagen to his Lightship. The destruction of these Energy Totems would allow the Primagen to escape the confines of his Lightship, and the resulting shockwave would destroy the known universe.|$|E
5|$|Tensional forces {{forming the}} Basin and Range physiogeographic {{province}} {{to the west}} about 20 to 25million years ago in Tertiary time created the two faults <b>that</b> <b>bound</b> the Markagunt Plateau (which underlies the park): the Sevier Fault on {{the east and the}} Hurricane Fault on the west. The Hurricane fault zone is a major, active, steeply west-dipping normal fault that stretches at least 155miles (250km) from south of the Grand Canyon northward to Cedar City, Utah. Along the southern boundary of the park, tectonic displacement along this fault is about 3,600ft (1,098m). Several other normal faults also developed on the plateau.|$|E

He also cited a verse in the New Testament that said there would not be marriage in heaven. In addition, he required members to adopt similar clothing and haircuts, possibly to reinforce that they were a non-sexual family.|$|E

Examples of rituals identified by Confucius as important to cultivate a ruler's de include: sacrificial rites held at ancestral temples to express thankfulness and humility; ceremonies of enfeoffment, toasting, and gift exchanges <b>that</b> <b>bound</b> nobility in complex hierarchical relationships of obligation and indebtedness; and, acts of formal politeness and decorum (i.e. bowing and yielding) that identify the performers as morally well-cultivated.|$|E

25|$|The {{influx of}} Chinese indentured {{immigrants}} aimed {{to replace the}} outlawed system of black slavery. It entailed signing a five-year contract <b>that</b> <b>bound</b> the labors physically to specific planters and their estates, and subjected them to physical and financial penalties whenever any contractural conditions were broken. The contracts consisted of a $4 wage for a 12-hour work day, also including food, clothing, medical care, and housing, although these contracts were regularly violated. Chinese immigrants could also arrive independent of the indentured system. These independent immigrants could come by paying their own way as an individual free migrant, or they could come sponsored and have their passage paid for reimbursement later. In 1917, the entire indentured immigration system was outlawed, largely due to pressure from Gandhi, who was then leading the nationalist movement in India.|$|E
25|$|The soliton {{model of}} a ball {{lightning}} was further developed. It was suggested that a ball lightning is based on spherically symmetric nonlinear oscillations of charged particles in plasma – the analogue of a spatial Langmuir soliton. These oscillations were described in both classical and quantum approaches. It {{was found that the}} most intense plasma oscillations occur in the central regions of a ball lightning. It is suggested <b>that</b> <b>bound</b> states of radially oscillating charged particles with oppositely oriented spins – the analogue of Cooper pairs – can appear inside a ball lightning. This phenomenon, in its turn, can lead to a superconducting phase in a ball lightning. The idea of the superconductivity in a ball lightning was considered earlier. The possibility of the existence of a ball lightning with a composite core was also discussed in this model.|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} the three guides came back, {{traversing}} the face from a hole near the Eigerwand station and risking their lives under incessant avalanches. Toni Kurz was still alive but almost helpless, {{with one hand and}} one arm completely frozen. Kurz hauled himself off the cliff after cutting loose the rope <b>that</b> <b>bound</b> him to his dead teammate below and climbed back onto the face. The guides were not able to pass an unclimbable overhang that separated them from Kurz. They managed to give him a rope long enough to reach them by tying two ropes together. While descending, Kurz could not get the knot to pass through his carabiner. He tried for hours to reach his rescuers who were only a few metres below him. Then he began to lose consciousness. One of the guides, climbing on another's shoulders, was able to touch the tip of Kurz's crampons with his ice-axe but could not reach higher. Kurz was unable to descend further and, completely exhausted, died slowly.|$|E
