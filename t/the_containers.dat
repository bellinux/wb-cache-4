5|$|Captain John Hart appears {{through the}} Cardiff space-time Rift using a vortex {{manipulator}} and asks Jack Harkness {{for help in}} locating three radioactive cluster bombs, apparently scattered across Cardiff. Jack Harkness tells his team that John cannot be trusted but agrees to help him. True to Jack's word, Captain John is lying and seizes <b>the</b> <b>containers,</b> trying to kill Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) using a paralyzing lip gloss, shooting Owen Harper (Burn Gorman), punching Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) and pushing Jack {{off the top of}} a building, thinking he's dead. However <b>the</b> <b>containers,</b> which are supposed to contain the location of a valuable diamond hidden by the lover he murdered, instead contain an explosive which latches on the DNA signature of her killer. As insurance against Torchwood leaving him to die, John handcuffs himself to Gwen and swallows the key. After superficially altering his DNA using that of the Torchwood staff, Jack and Owen are able to save John's life before banishing him. Spurned by his former lover, John leaves by means of his Vortex Manipulator.|$|E
5|$|The Hershey brothers, Jacob, Isaac, John, Paris, and Eli, founded Hershey Creamery Company in 1894, {{with the}} company {{originally}} operating out of the Hershey family's Lancaster County farmhouse. The ice cream was packed in metal-lined wooden containers that the Hershey brothers designed and built. <b>The</b> <b>containers</b> were loaded into trucks with ice packed around them to keep the ice cream fresh and cold. Salesmen traveled daily routes to deliver product to customers in the county and in surrounding areas.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternate}} way {{of conducting}} the experiment: after the charged object C is lowered into <b>the</b> <b>container</b> in Procedure 2, the outside surface of <b>the</b> <b>container</b> is momentarily grounded. The charge {{on the outside}} of <b>the</b> <b>container</b> all drains off to ground, and the charge detector declines to zero, leaving the charge on the inside of <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> equal but opposite to that on C. Then the object C is removed from <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> Since C is no longer present to hold the induced charge on the inside surface of <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> it migrates to the outside of <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> so <b>the</b> charge detector registers an equal but opposite charge from its previous reading. This new charge can be proved to be equal and opposite to the charge on C by touching C to the exterior surface of <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> <b>The</b> two charges exactly neutralize each other, so both the exterior of <b>the</b> <b>container</b> and C are found to be uncharged.|$|R
50|$|The charged object C is touched to {{the inside}} of <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> <b>The</b> charge {{detector}} reading does not change. However, if the object is now withdrawn from <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> <b>the</b> reading stays the same, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>container</b> now has a net charge. If the object is then tested with the charge detector, it is found to be completely uncharged, and the inside of <b>the</b> <b>container</b> is also found to be uncharged. This indicates that all the charge on C has been transferred to <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> and has exactly neutralized the opposite charge on the inside surface of <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> leaving only <b>the</b> charge on the outside. So the charge on the inside of <b>the</b> <b>container</b> was exactly equal to the charge on C.|$|R
40|$|Apparatus for gauging {{the amount}} of liquid in a {{container}} of liquid and gas under flow or zero gravity net conditions includes an accumulator and appropriate connector apparatus for communicating gas between the accumulator and <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> In one form of the invention, gas is removed from <b>the</b> <b>container</b> and compressed into the accumulator. The pressure and temperature of the fluid in <b>the</b> <b>container</b> is measured before and after removal of the gas; the pressure and temperature of gas in the accumulator is measured before and after compression of the gas into the accumulator from <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> These pressure and temperature measurements are used in determining the volume of gas in <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> whereby <b>the</b> volume of liquid in <b>the</b> <b>container</b> can be determined from {{the difference between the}} known volume of <b>the</b> <b>container</b> and <b>the</b> volume of gas in <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> Gas from <b>the</b> accumulator may be communicated into <b>the</b> <b>container</b> in a similar process as a verification of the gauging of the liquid volume, or as an independent process for determining the volume of liquid in <b>the</b> <b>container...</b>|$|R
5|$|To {{obtain the}} {{greatest}} operational efficiency, ML constructed two dedicated container terminals {{with their own}} gantry cranes, spreaders etc. The Manchester terminal was built on an open site next to {{the western end of}} No. 9 Dock. A second container berth was added in 1972. The other terminal was created at Montreal, with similar equipment, where <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> were trans-shipped to a dedicated liner train operated by Canadian National Railways, which carried them onwards to Toronto and further destinations.|$|E
5|$|The Zoios' clandestine {{transaction}} with Turp initially progressed well, {{but fell}} apart in March 1966, when Turp discovered he {{would actually be}} arming Rhodesia rather than Pakistan, reacted with alarm and informed the British government. The British Board of Trade tightened its control over arms transactions, and encouraged its NATO counterparts to do the same, while the Zoios {{turned their attention to}} Belgian, Italian and West German arms dealers. In October 1966, a huge consignment of army and air force equipment arrived in Rhodesia from the seaports of Mozambique, with many of <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> bearing metropolitan Portuguese markings. Prominent among the European weapons were FN FAL battle rifles from Belgium, which allowed an unofficial Rhodesian trade delegation to operate quietly in spite of the sanctions.|$|E
5|$|She is then tasked {{to escort}} Dr. Otto Schenker, an East German scientist, to England. Later on, as Cate and Dr. Schenker {{fly back to}} England, he is {{captured}} by H.A.R.M., led by Magnus Armstrong, who knocks Cate unconscious. Armstrong decides to spare Cate's life, believing {{that she is a}} fellow Scot. Cate awakens and is soon thrown from the plane as it explodes. After surviving the fall via parachute, Cate is later introduced to a new partner, Tom Goodman, a UNITY agent from the American branch. After meeting him in a nightclub in Hamburg, they are ambushed by H.A.R.M. but manage to escape. The nightclub is owned by a German singer named Inge Wagner, whom Cate suspects is connected with H.A.R.M. The two are then tasked to investigate a cargo freighter containing several suspicious chemical containers that UNITY believes are linked to Dr. Schenker. Cate gets in the freighter, and after taking photos of <b>the</b> <b>containers,</b> is knocked unconscious by Armstrong, who spares her life by locking her in a cargo hold, thus ignoring Wagner's insistence that she must be liquidated. As the freighter heads out to sea, it slowly begins to sink, due to a huge explosion. Wagner and Armstrong escape immediately, but Cate has to fight her way out of the bowels of the freighter. Because Cate could not obtain the required information, she and Tom must return to the sunken freighter to finish gathering intelligence aboard. Cate goes scuba diving, and after investigating the shipwreck and obtaining the captain's log and the cargo manifest, she is ambushed by H.A.R.M. divers sent from a submarine commanded by Armstrong and Wagner but manages to escape.|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} for calibrating {{an acoustic}} sensor is described. The apparatus includes a transmission material having an acoustic impedance approximately matching the acoustic impedance {{of the actual}} acoustic medium existing when the acoustic sensor is applied in actual in-service conditions. An elastic <b>container</b> holds <b>the</b> transmission material. A first sensor is coupled to <b>the</b> <b>container</b> at a first location on <b>the</b> <b>container</b> and a second sensor coupled to <b>the</b> <b>container</b> at a second location on <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> <b>the</b> second location being different from the first location.

40|$|The {{transmission}} {{measuring cell}} determines the {{optical absorption of}} a sample fluid. A light passage opening introduces light in <b>the</b> <b>container</b> (12). A reflector unit (26) aligns the light in such a manner, relative to <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> that {{a large part of}} the light passes through <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> without multiple reflections at a wall of <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> <b>The</b> substrate (10) is made of silicon. <b>The</b> <b>container</b> has an elongated shape. <b>The</b> <b>container</b> is closed by a cover (20). The reflector unit is a wall, inclined relative to the longitudinal direction of <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> A beam transformation of fed light is effected by a lens (6), whilst a further lens effects the reverse operation. ADVANTAGE - With small consumption of sample fluid or reagent, facilitates high determination accuracy...|$|R

25|$|The copepods can {{be added}} to water-storage {{containers}} where the mosquitoes breed. Copepods, primarily of the genera Mesocyclops and Macrocyclops (such as Macrocyclops albidus), can survive for periods of months in <b>the</b> <b>containers,</b> if <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> are not completely drained by their users. They attack, kill, and eat the younger first- and second-instar larvae of the mosquitoes. This biological control method is complemented by community trash removal and recycling to eliminate other possible mosquito-breeding sites. Because the water in these containers is drawn from uncontaminated sources such as rainfall, the risk of contamination by cholera bacteria is small, and in fact no cases of cholera have been linked to copepods introduced into water-storage containers. Trials using copepods to control container-breeding mosquitoes are underway in several other countries, including Thailand and the southern United States. The method, though, would be very ill-advised in areas where the guinea worm is endemic.|$|E

30|$|To {{solve the}} above problem this paper proposes a {{feasible}} scheme. A dynamic vector container is {{created in the}} memory to hold the current data, and the old data from <b>the</b> <b>container</b> are saved in files. At the beginning the filtered data (a sample per 50 ms) are allowed to get into <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> When <b>the</b> amount (samples) of data in <b>the</b> <b>container</b> exceed a threshold (5 samples), the data are allowed to simultaneously flow out of <b>the</b> <b>container</b> in first-in-first-out order and saved into a file in the hard disk. When a pause operation is needed, no data are allowed to flow out of <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>container</b> is almost full, the outflow of data from <b>the</b> <b>container</b> is controlled to be faster than the inflow {{in order to keep}} the data in <b>the</b> <b>container</b> newest. To make the play-back operation rapidly, each file will not exceed the size of 1 megabyte. When a file reaches 1 megabyte, a new file is created. In addition, in routine operation <b>the</b> <b>container</b> can not be empty to keep the output data continuous. With these skills, the current data can be decoded and displayed in time, and the old data are saved perfectly and can be selectively played back at any time.|$|R
