5|$|During the Voldemort Can't Stop the Rock! tour, Paul and Joe DeGeorge {{received}} a letter from Warner Brothers that stated that the brothers were breaking copyright laws. Although Paul sent a letter to Warner Brothers in an attempt to smooth <b>things</b> <b>over,</b> Marc Brandon, the company representative, asked to speak to Paul personally. The two later settled upon a Gentlemen's agreement that, in essence, would allow Harry and the Potters to continue to sell music online and tour, but all other merchandise could only be sold at live shows.|$|E
5|$|The episode starts {{where the}} {{previous}} one ended, at Kaitlin (Kristin McGee) and Floyd DeBarber's (Jason Sudeikis) wedding. Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), who is scheduled to do a reading at the ceremony, wastes time so that her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), after sending her a text message to stall for time, can talk <b>things</b> <b>over</b> with Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore). He has admitted to Nancy {{that he is in}} love with both her and Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks), but she cannot cope with what Jack has told her. The two talk the situation over, and Jack eventually tells Nancy that he cares for her and decides he wants to be with her.|$|E
5|$|Bart gladly accepts Martin's offer, {{as there}} is no other way he could win over Nelson. Homer, however, feels betrayed by Bart's choice to drive Martin's racer instead of the one he helped Bart to make. When Bart tries to {{apologize}} to Homer, he selfishly denounces both Bart and Martin, telling Bart to do whatever he wants. Marge steps in and tells Homer that she has defended him through a lot of <b>things</b> <b>over</b> the years, but his latest actions prove that he is a bad father. As Bart gets ready to race in the final match with Martin's newly tuned racer, Homer thinks to himself about how selfish he has been, realizing that Bart needs his support regardless of whose racer he is using, and he rushes off to the race. At the starting line, Homer wishes Bart good luck and tells him that no matter how the race ends he will still be proud of him. The race is tough as Nelson pulls every dirty trick in his arsenal, but eventually through his skill Bart finishes first and the team enjoys their victory.|$|E

5|$|Liz {{attempts}} to make amends by talking to Tracy during a rehearsal, during which she makes negative remarks about Jenna {{and the other members}} of her staff. Liz is notified by Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) that her chat with Tracy was aired over the studio's monitors, which meant that everyone heard and saw her making the comments. Liz's staff show their displeasure by throwing food and other objects at her. Liz and Tracy discuss an idea to get everyone together to try and smooth <b>things</b> <b>over,</b> and Tracy decides to invite Liz and the staff to a party aboard a yacht. Tracy gets along well with everyone at the party, including Jenna, and things appear to be going very well. Liz soon discovers that the yacht does not belong to Tracy, and the yacht's real owner shows up with the NYPD. The following day Liz learns that Jack paid the newspapers to keep Tracy out of the press but left a photo of Jenna passing out on the yacht in their pages, which Jenna sees as exciting and flattering.|$|E

25|$|The English {{were again}} {{exploiting}} the precious woods of the region, in Yucatan and Belize. A Spanish privateer seized an English sloop and frigate carrying logwood off Cape Catoche, Yucatan (now in Quintana Roo). Acuña y Manrique sent an armed expedition {{consisting of two}} pirogues of war, one galleon and 300 men to dislodge the English. However, upon arrival the Spanish discovered that the English were numerous and well armed, with 800 men and large warships. The Spanish expedition was not successful. Parallel diplomatic negotiations also came to nothing. The viceroy let the matter drop, preferring to concentrate on <b>things</b> <b>over</b> which he had control. These included the garrisons at San Juan de Ulúa, Isla del Carmen, Veracruz, and the bays of Espíritu Santo and Pensacola.|$|E
25|$|For the site's {{first few}} years, this {{practice}} of self-policing ensured {{a high level}} of quality and allowed Haughey to use a light touch in moderating the site; however, as the community has grown, Haughey has expanded the site's staff and taken a more active role. In 2004, Jessamyn West began assisting him with moderation duties; in 2007, user Josh Millard ("cortex") was appointed as an additional moderator. In 2008, London user Ricardo Vacapinta assumed off-hours moderator duties, and in April 2011 Jeremy Preacher (restless_nomad) came on {{to keep an eye on}} <b>things</b> <b>over</b> the weekend. A flagging feature allows members to call moderator attention to substandard, offensive, or outstanding posts, allowing users continued input towards shaping the site while quickly alerting site staff to potential trouble spots.|$|E

25|$|People rely on compulsions as {{an escape}} from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the {{intrusive}} thoughts will soon return. Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain <b>things</b> <b>over</b> and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on {{the context in which}} the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.|$|E
25|$|Savil, realizing Vanyel needs special assistance, {{takes him}} to the Tayledras, human beings who live in K'Treva, an {{environment}} immersed in magic. They {{teach him how to}} control his abilities, and convince him that being gay is not wrong or sinful. Vanyel {{does not want to be}} a Herald or a Mage, and suspects the people around him value his powers, not himself. He runs away, but as he thinks <b>things</b> <b>over</b> he realizes that Savil and the others have shown that they care about him. Just when he realizes that and moves to return he discovers a village being terrorized by a colddrake, a type of dragon. Before he can even think to do anything, he witnesses the dragon killing an elderly man. He pulls himself together and kills the dragon, but the unfortunate timing gives Vanyel the impression that he is a coward. The Tayledras later explain that he is not at all cowardly and that his reactions were normal.|$|E

In 1603, James fought with Anne over the proposed composition of her English household, sending her a message that [...] "his Majesty took her continued perversity very heinously." [...] In turn, Anne took exception to James' drinking: in 1604 she confided to the French envoy that [...] "the King drinks so much, and conducts himself so ill in every respect, that I expect an early and evil result." ...|$|E

[...] Hendricks said that Joan's motivation was [...] "protection [...] her child." [...] Hendricks felt that Joan saw herself as an equal in a way to the other partners after going through with the deal, as Joan had seen them do worse <b>things</b> <b>over</b> her thirteen years in employment.|$|E
