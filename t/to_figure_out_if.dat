500|$|Most of Martha's storylines were {{central to}} her on-off {{relationship}} with Jack Holden (Paul O'Brien). Viewers saw the couple go through marriage, divorce, a second marriage and Martha being widowed. Holy Soap said that Martha and Jack {{proved to be}} one of the [...] "best loved couples", before they married for the first time. However, their marriage does not last long and they split. Martha and Jack start to lead separate lives, but Jack is there for Martha after she has an abortion. Martha is feeling low at this point and kisses him; Jack's girlfriend Sam Tolhurst (Jessica Chapnik) sees this. O'Brien stated: [...] "I think Jack felt like 'Oh this is nice, but I've moved on, I've finally moved on and found someone', but deep down he still wants Martha." [...] Martha is left [...] "shattered" [...] after Jack plans to marry Sam. Martha was caught trying on Sam's wedding dress as she tried <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> she still had feelings for Jack. Gordon said that from day one, Jack and Martha have wanted to be together, but [...] "they're never in the same headspace". O'Brien added that he believes Jack was always in love with Martha, even whilst he was in a relationship with Sam. Both O'Brien and Gordon agreed that when Jack and Martha first broke up it was a bad time for Jack, as his life was spiraling out of control, he needed her, but she left him when he needed her the most. They later become friends; O'Brien believed it was hard to understand how Jack could be so forgiving toward her.|$|E

30|$|As {{crude oil}} supply {{all over the}} world is {{becoming}} heavier and inferior in quality and the demand for middle distillate is larger, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process is still the key process in oil refinery and is now in rapid development [6]. The retardation effects of nitrogen compounds and condensed aromatics in FCC process have <b>to</b> be <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> shale oil is used to produce clean fuel. The retarding effects of basic nitrogen compounds may be explained by two mechanisms [7, 8, 9]. First, the basic nitrogen compounds reversibly absorb on the Brønsted or Lewis acid centers and then poison the acid centers, thus weaken other hydrocarbons cracking ability. Second, since their big size and aromatic nature, the basic nitrogen compounds may be the precursors of coke. Li et al. [10] found that the retarding effects of non-basic compounds and condensed aromatics in catalytic cracking of coker gas oil are not as serious as those of basic nitrogen compounds.|$|R

40|$|Neural growth {{inhibitory}} factor (GIF), {{a member}} of metallothionein family (metallothionein- 3, MT 3), was well known by its distinct neural growth inhibitory activity, which is not shown by other MT isoforms. However, till now, people still did not know clearly how GIF exerts its biological functions. Since {{it has been reported}} that GIF might serve as NO scavenger and was related to the release of zinc, our study was focused on the interaction of GIF and NO. By studying the reactions of human GIF and human MT 1 g with SNOC - a type of NO donor, it was found that GIF was more reactive than MT- 1 g toward SNOC. In order <b>to</b> further <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> the high reactivity of GIF in this reaction resulted from the acid-base catalysis, several mutants were constructed: E 23 K, E 41 G/E 43 A, E 23 K/E 41 G/E 43 A. By studying their basic properties and the reactions toward SNOC, it was found that the S-nitrosylation of GIF was not only related to the acid-base catalysis, but also to the accessibility of metal-thiolate clusters. © 2005 SIOC, CAS, & Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|Relapse {{prevention}} {{in clean}} addicts {{is a great}} challenge for addiction-therapy. As strong cravings often precede relapse, anti-craving drugs {{seem to be a}} promising way for addicts to stay clean. Naloxone and acamprosate are two candidates for anti-craving drugs that are already used for relapse prevention in alcoholic patients. However, it has <b>to</b> be <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> both drugs are also effective in opiate-addicts. In order to evaluate their effectiveness, a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm was used in rats conditioned to 10 mg/kg, i. p., morphine. As acamprosate and naloxone have been suggested to selectively affect different types of craving (withdrawal-craving versus reward-craving), we have tried to modulate craving-behaviour by maintaining two groups of rats under different conditions (isolated versus group-housed). Thereafter, the effectiveness of acamprosate (200 mg/kg, i. p.) and naloxone (2 mg/kg, i. p.) in reducing morphine-CPP expression was evaluated. As a result, isolation produced a weak reduction in morphine-CPP development. Furthermore, acamprosate and naloxone had no effect on morphine-CPP expression. Based on the present results, we assume that the anti-craving drugs acamprosate and naloxone may not be effective for relapse prevention in opiate-addicts. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|The Voting Rights Act (“VRA”), {{the most}} {{successful}} civil rights statute in American history, is dying. In the recent Shelby County decision, the U. S. Supreme Court signaled that the anti-discrimination model, long understood {{as the basis for}} the VRA as originally enacted, is no longer the best way to understand today’s voting rights questions. As a result, voting rights activists need to face up to the fact that voting rights law and policy are at a critical moment of transition. It is likely the case that the superstatute we once knew as the VRA is no more and is never to return. If so, we need <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what, <b>if</b> anything, can, will, or should replace it. But before <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> where <b>to</b> go from here, we need to understand first how we arrived at the moment of the VRA’s disintegration so as not to repeat the mistakes of the not too distant past. In this Article, we argue that the VRA is dying because the consensus over the existence and persistence of racial discrimination in voting has dissolved. From this premise, we outline three paths for the future of voting rights policy: (1) rebuilding a new consensus over the racial discrimination model; (2) forging a new consensus over what we call an autonomy model; or (3) reconceiving voting rights in universal terms...|$|R

I offer an alternative theory, called provocation as akrasia, which I suggest can solve the puzzle. According to this theory, the basic elements of the defense work in concert to achieve the normatively attractive goal of sorting actors who kill in defiance of the law (and who should therefore be convicted of murder) from those who kill in a moment of culpable ignorance of law or weakness of will (and who should therefore be convicted of the lesser crime of manslaughter). Insofar as this theory justifies and so defends the basic contours of existing provocation doctrine, it challenges those who view the doctrine, in some or all of its formulations, as a pernicious presence in the criminal law...|$|R
