50|$|The Board of Tea Appeals was a United States {{federal agency}} under the {{jurisdiction}} of the Food and Drug Administration. From its establishment in 1897 until its abolishment in 1996, it adjudicated the claims of tea importers whose products were denied entry into the United States by federal <b>tea-tasters.</b> The Board was authorized to permit delivery or order destruction or exportation of substandard teas.|$|R
5000|$|Tea Importation Act of 1897 was a United States {{public law}} forbidding {{the import of}} tea into the United States with {{excessive}} levels of fluoride, heavy metals, oxalate, and pesticides. The Act of Congress established a uniform standard of purity and quality while attempting to achieve the optimal health effects of tea and phenolic content in tea. The statute declared it unlawful to import into the United States [...] "any merchandise as tea which is inferior in purity, quality, and fitness for consumption to the standards kept at customhouses..." [...] For nearly a century, Congress provided that no imported tea could enter the United States unless federal <b>tea-tasters</b> decided that it measured up to preselected standard samples. The law restricted the International trade of camellia sinensis.|$|R
40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{philosophical}} anxiety has fixated on the notorious fact that the world does not always match our experience of it. Conversely, {{little attention has been}} paid to the equally interesting and similarly difficult phenomenon of expert perception—the ability to train one’s perceptual sensitivity. In this essay, I analyze the perceptual expertise of <b>tea-tasters</b> and argue that their privileged gustatory standing reveals episodes of perception to be the potentially skilled exercises of a power to take in how things are with the sensible world. This view of expert perception poses an explanatory challenge for both internalist and externalist pictures of mentality—the two of which grow up out of a concern with preserving our perceptual access to the world while simultaneously accounting for the fallibility of this access. This gestures at the possibility that a satisfying account of expert perception requires explanatory work to be done by both the ‘internal’ development of our perceptual mental states and by the world figuring as a constituent of those states. I contend that, should naïve realism adopt the notion that perceptual experience is conceptually articulated, it will be furnished with the resources necessary to answer expert perception’s challenge to externalism...|$|R
50|$|Bridges visited England between 1879 and 1880. During {{that time}} she visited her brother Henry, who worked there as a <b>tea-taster</b> and {{traveled}} to China in the commission of his work. Her works, which reflected an Oriental aesthetic with plain background and asymmetrical compositions, were exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts. Some of her compositions are {{similar to that of}} the Flower and Bird series of Japanese woodblock print artist, Hiroshige.|$|E
5000|$|Vernon {{was born}} in Collins Street, Melbourne, {{and grew up in}} that city. His name was {{originally}} John Lett, and {{he was the son of}} Richard Lett, a brickmaker, and his wife Jane Catherine, née Williamson. He worked as a clerk at the age of 15 and the next year as a <b>tea-taster</b> and blender. He made his stage debut at the age of eighteen, at Ballarat, Victoria, in a farce, Turn Him Out. [...] On 2 February 1870, aged 21, as Norman Letville, he married an actress, Mary Jane Walker (d. 1905). They had nine children.Vernon developed a pleasing light tenor voice. In 1872-73, he played in a season of opera bouffes in Australia with the Alice May company. In their production of Cox and Box, he played Mr. Box. [...] With that company, he then toured New Zealand and India. In 1874, with the Lyster Opera Company, he was successful as Myles na Coppaleen in a production of The Lily of Killarney.|$|E
40|$|Tea is {{probably}} the most popular drink worldwide. Among all the beverages consumed worldwide, tea is a very popular one and used by all strata of people. There are several types of tea like black tea, green tea, Oolong tea etc., and out of these, black tea is the most common beverage. Black tea has got two major varieties, viz., [1] orthodox and [2] CTC (Cut–Tear– Curl operations are performed during production of this type of tea). For measurement of tea quality, unfortunately no instrumental methods are deployed on regular basis in the industry and for the assessment of Quality, traditional methods of employing professional tea tasters are still being practiced. These tasters, based on their experience and judgment, assess the quality of tea and the pricing of tea is made accordingly. The <b>tea-tasters</b> give a mark in the range of 1 to 10 each for leaf quality, infusion and liquor of the sample [1]. This method is purely subjective and error-prone. Thus there is a demand in the industry to have low-cost, portable solutions for quality evaluation of black tea. In this regard, electronic nose has been demonstrated to be an appropriate candidate [2] for the same. The flavour in different commercial organic products like Tea, Coffee, Wine, etc. arises from Volatile organic compounds (VOC) emitted during infusion. VOCs are commonly used as ingredients in household products or in industrial processes where they normally get vaporized at room temperature and can be breathed, and unfortunately, many VOCs can cause adverse health effects[3]. Other synthetic products such as paints, wax or fuels can release toxic vapors when they are stored; even some foods, such as beverages, fish and meat products, emit organic vapours[4]. VOCs are also present in some workplaces, especially in the chemical industries; in these cases, it is important to monitor the concentration of the vapors to safeguard the health of the workers, and also to keep atmospheri...|$|R
