Substrate specificity is directed exclusively towards the cognate transfer origin: the RP 4 -specified TraJ protein cannot recognize the closely related oriT of plasmid R 751. After nicking, TraI protein remains attached to the 5 '-terminal 2 '-deoxycytidyl residue at the nic site [Pansegrau, W., Ziegelin, G. & Lanka, E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10637 - 10644].

We have examined the unequal crossover event that was responsible for a number of intergeneric merodiploids.

We found that when the S. typhimurium donor had its <b>transfer</b> <b>origin</b> closely linked to metB and argH, all recombinants examined were merodiploid, and they generally arose as F-prime factors. Many of these F-prime factors had been created by recombination between flanking rrn genes in the donor. When the S. typhimurium Hfr <b>transfer</b> <b>origin</b> was more distant from the selected markers, quite different results were obtained. (1) Depending on the donor, 19 – 47 % of the recombinants that acquired the donor argH+ or metB+ genes were merodiploid for these loci, but none of the recombinants were F-prime. (2) A majority of the merodiploids had a novel (nonparental) rrn gene, indicating that unequal recombination between nonidentical rrn genes was a prevalent mechanism for establishing the merodiploidy.

Consequently, Tn 5 induced auxotrophic mutations could be equated with or distinguished from previously mapped mutations, and closely linked markers ordered, on the basis of marker recovery using the two classes of Hfr donor.

We have now identified the <b>transfer</b> <b>origin</b> (oriT) region of one of the Bacteroides conjugative transposons, TcrEmr DOT, and have shown that it is located near the middle of the conjugative transposon. We have also identified a 16 -kbp region of the conjugal transposon which is necessary and sufficient for conjugal transfer of the element and which is located near the oriT. This same region proved to be sufficient for mobilization of coresident plasmids and unlinked integrated elements as well as for self-transfer, indicating that all of these activities are mediated by the same transfer system. Previously, we had reported that disruption of a gene, rteC, abolished self-transfer of the element. rteC is one of a set of rte genes that appears to mediate tetracycline induction of transfer activities of the conjugative transposons. On the basis of these and other data, we had proposed that RteC activated expression of transfer genes. We have now found, however, that when the transfer region of TcrEmr DOT was cloned as a plasmid that did not contain rteC and the plasmid (pLYL 72) was tested for transfer out of a Bacteroides strain that did not have a copy of rteC in the chromosome, the plasmid was self-transmissible without tetracycline induction. This and other findings suggest that RteC is not an activator transfer genes but is stimulating transfer in some other way...|$|E

5000|$|Although gene {{comparisons}} and phylogenetic {{studies are}} helpful in investigating horizontal gene transfer, the DNA sequences of genes {{are even more}} revelatory of their origin and ancestry within a genome. Bacterial species differ widely in overall GC content, although the genes in any one species' genome are roughly identical with respect to base composition, patterns of codon usage, and frequencies of di- and trinucleotides.

For example, many of the S. enterica genes that are not present in E. coli have base compositions that differ from the overall 52% GC content of the entire chromosome. Within this species, some lineages {{have more than a}} megabase of DNA that is not present in other lineages.
