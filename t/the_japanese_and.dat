5|$|Allied forces sent {{to disarm}} <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>and</b> {{repatriate}} {{prisoners of war}} arrived in Indonesia in September 1945. In Semarang, {{this led to a}} conflict between Japanese forces and Indonesian rebels, that began on 15October; the Indonesians aimed to confiscate the Japanese weapons. Allied forces began landing in the city on 20October 1945; a small group was sent to Gedangan to speak with Soegijapranata. Concerned with civilian suffering, the vicar apostolic told the Allies that they must stop the battle; the Allies could not comply as they did not know the Japanese commander. Soegijapranata then contacted <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>and,</b> that afternoon, brokered a cease-fire agreement in his office at Gedangan, despite Indonesian forces' firing at the Gurkha soldiers posted in front of the building.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>and</b> the U.S. {{elected to}} {{completely}} withdraw their warships from the area, ending the battle. The Japanese naval forces lingered near the northern Solomons, {{out of range}} of the U.S. aircraft based at Henderson Field, before finally returning to Truk on 5 September.|$|E
5|$|Collecting centres {{for native}} {{foodstuffs}} and tracks {{leading from the}} coast were bombed by the US Fifth Air Force.

5|$|From Pusan a good {{railroad}} system {{built by}} <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>and</b> well ballasted with crushed rock and river gravel extended northward. Subordinate rail lines ran westward {{along the south}} coast through Masan and Chinju and northeast near the east coast to P'ohang-dong. There the eastern line turned inland through the east-central Taebaek Mountains area. The railroads were {{the backbone of the}} UN transportation system in Korea.|$|E
5|$|In November, Herring flew {{across the}} {{mountains}} {{to take control of}} the fighting around Buna, leaving Blamey to control operations elsewhere in New Guinea. Herring planned the systematic reduction of the Japanese positions at Buna and Sanananda.

5000|$|The Moro Muslims of Mindanao and Sulu took up {{arms and}} fought hard against <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> {{invasion}} <b>and</b> helped defeat <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> occupation. Some of the Moros {{had been fighting}} the Americans just weeks before <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> invaded <b>and</b> proceeded to direct their fight against the new invaders as well. Sultan Jainal Abirin II of Sulu opposed <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> invasion. <b>The</b> violent armed struggle against <b>the</b> <b>Japanese,</b> Filipinos, Spanish, <b>and</b> Americans is considered by current Moro Muslim leaders {{as part of the}} four centuries long [...] "national liberation movement" [...] of the Bangsamoro (Moro Nation). The 400-year-long resistance against <b>the</b> <b>Japanese,</b> Americans, <b>and</b> Spanish by the Moro Muslims persisted and morphed into their current war for independence against the Philippine state.|$|R

5|$|The British {{government}} {{proposed that}} British Lieutenant General Sir Charles Keightley be given command of a Commonwealth Corps for Operation Coronet, the proposed invasion of Honshu, the main island of Japan, but the Australian government {{had no intention}} of concurring with the appointment of an officer with no experience fighting <b>the</b> <b>Japanese,</b> <b>and</b> counter-proposed Morshead for the command. The war ended before the issue was resolved.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch accused Sukarno and Hatta of {{collaborating with}} <b>the</b> <b>Japanese,</b> <b>and</b> denounced the Republic as a {{creation}} of Japanese fascism.

5|$|The Huks {{began their}} anti-Japanese {{campaign}} as five 100-man units. They obtained needed {{arms and ammunition}} from Philippine army stragglers, which were escapees from the Battle of Bataan and deserters from the Philippine Constabulary, in exchange of civilian clothes. The Huk recruitment campaign progressed more slowly than Taruc had expected, due to competition with U.S. Army Forces Far East (USAFFE) guerrilla units in enlisting new soldiers. The U.S. units already had recognition among the islands, had trained military leaders, and an organized command and logistical system. Despite being restrained by the American sponsored guerrilla units, the Huks nevertheless took to the battlefield with only 500 men and much fewer weapons. Several setbacks {{at the hands of}} <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>and</b> with less than enthusiastic support from USAFFE units did not hinder the Huks growth in size and efficiency throughout the war, developing into a well trained, highly organized force with some 15,000 armed fighters by war's end. The Huks attacked both <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>and</b> other non-Huk guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|The Library was patronised {{mainly by}} <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>and</b> {{captured}} European staff from the Department of Information, who created propaganda for the Japanese invasion of India and Australia. More than 13,000 volumes were also circulated to civil internees at the Maxwell Road Customs House and prisoners-of-war at Changi Prison. Among these volumes were prayer books, hymnals, music sheets and children's books.|$|E
5|$|A {{civilian}} government {{was established in}} 1922 with its headquarters at Koror, replacing the military administration. The {{civilian government}} initiated a programme to identify and collectivise unused land between 1923 and 1932 for redevelopment. Much of these land were used to build new industrial estates and expand towns to accommodate immigrants from Japan and Okinawa. In Japan, the government actively encouraged <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>and</b> Okinawans to resettle in Micronesia, including Palau, and began establishing farming settlements. The first farming settlement was established at Ngaremlengui in 1926, but the settlers encountered problems with its humid tropical environment and abandoned it by 1930, although later settlements were established more successfully.|$|E
50|$|After {{decades of}} {{intervention}} in Korean affairs, Japan formally annexed Korea in 1910. Annexation meant that Koreans became subjects of <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> Emperor <b>and</b> were considered <b>Japanese</b> nationals by <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> government. Despite this seemingly equal status, colonial policy facilitated differential treatment of Koreans. At the same time, it constituted an increasingly coercive program of assimilation into <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> state <b>and</b> <b>Japanese</b> cultural norms.|$|R

5|$|Another seven internees were {{executed}} by the Japanese authorities. These internees had possessed a radio set which they used to pass messages {{in and out of}} camp. The radio was discovered by <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>and</b> the internees were arrested. The other internees were forced to watch their public torture. Military trials were subsequently held and on 29 October 1943, some of the internees {{were executed}} by being shot and at least one, John Fraser, was beheaded. Aside from this, the Japanese authorities had executed by decapitation, three Chinese policemen for bringing cigarettes and tobacco to the camp's internees.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} caught in the harbour during the Battle of Weihaiwei in early 1895, with Zhenyuan only {{partially}} seaworthy. They were unable to prevent the capture of the port's fortifications by <b>the</b> <b>Japanese,</b> <b>and</b> underwent nightly attacks by torpedo boats. Dingyuen was hit by a torpedo and began to sink. She was quickly beached, where she settled into the mud, and continued {{to be used as a}} defensive fort. Admiral Ruchang's flag was subsequently moved across to Zhenyuan. Following Ruchang's suicide, the surrender of the port and the fleet was arranged. Dingyuen was blown up by the Japanese forces, as they were unable to salvage her, although there is a suggestion following an eye witness account that she may have been mined by the Chinese.|$|E
5|$|By early 1943 the Australian Army's focus {{had shifted}} to {{operations}} in the Pacific theatre against <b>the</b> <b>Japanese,</b> <b>and</b> the 9th Division received orders to return to Australia to join the other two 2nd AIF divisions, the 6th and 7th, which had departed earlier in 1942. A divisional parade was held in Gaza, after which the 2/15th embarked upon the transport Acquitania and sailed with a large convoy established under Operation Pamphlet {{as part of the}} final stage in the withdrawal of the 2nd AIF divisions from the Middle East. After a journey of just over a month, the Acquitania berthed at Sydney in late February 1943. During this time the battalion was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Raymond Barham.|$|E

5|$|Development {{continued}} through late 2002, with targeted release dates of December in Japan and early 2003 in North America. During the final stages, two planned dungeons that fell behind schedule were cut {{and replaced with}} a quest to recover Triforce pieces around the Great Sea. Elements of these dungeons were recycled for later Zelda games. On October 15, 2002, Nintendo revealed the game's official Japanese subtitle, Kaze no Takuto (Wind Baton), to emphasize the role of wind in the game. The company announced the official English version, The Wind Waker, on December 2, 2002. In the gap between <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>and</b> North American releases, the designers reworked some troublesome segments, notably shortening the lengthy Triforce quest.|$|E
5|$|During the {{exchange}} of gunfire, Farenholt received several damaging hits from both <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>and</b> American ships, killing several men. She escaped from the crossfire by crossing ahead of San Francisco and passing to the disengaged side of Scott's column. Duncan—still engaged in her solitary torpedo attack on the Japanese formation—was also hit by gunfire from both sides, set afire, and looped away in her own effort to escape the crossfire.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} epoch, the Chinese lost their secret to the Koreans, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese,</b> <b>and,</b> later, the Indians, as these {{cultures}} discovered {{how to make}} silk. Allusions to the fabric in the Old Testament show that it was known in western Asia in biblical times. Scholars believe that starting in the 2nd century BCE the Chinese established a commercial network aimed at exporting silk to the West. Silk was used, for example, by the Persian court and its king, Darius III, when Alexander the Great conquered the empire. Even though silk spread rapidly across Eurasia, {{with the possible exception}} of Japan its production remained exclusively Chinese for three millennia.|$|E
