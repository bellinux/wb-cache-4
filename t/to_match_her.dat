5|$|Rinuccini used {{numerous}} classical {{sources as}} the basis for his libretto, in particular works of Ovid—the Heroides and the Metamorphoses—and poems from Catullus. After a prologue, the main action begins as Venus tells Cupid that Ariadne and her lover Theseus, fleeing from Crete after his slaying of the Minotaur, will shortly arrive in Naxos. Theseus, she reports, will then abandon Ariadne, as he believes her to be unacceptable to the people of Athens as their queen. Venus plans <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>her</b> instead with the god Bacchus, and asks Cupid to arrange this. Theseus and Arianna arrive; Theseus agonises over his decision to abandon her, but is advised by his counsellor that he is wise in his resolve, and departs. In the morning Ariadne, finding herself abandoned, searches vainly for Theseus on the shore, where she sings her lament. A fanfare indicates an imminent arrival; Ariadne hopes this is Theseus returning, but it is Bacchus and his entourage. Jupiter speaks from the heavens, and amid festive scenes Bacchus promises Ariadne immortality with the gods in return for her love.|$|E

The 2008 Xiamen Marathon provided an opportunity to qualify for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but her time of 2:25:10 hours was only enough for third as her younger compatriots Zhang Yingying and Bai Xue took the top two spots.

In December 2012, in her first half Ironman distance event, she took first place at Ironman 70.3 in Canberra and then she took first place at the Ironman 70.3 Asia-Pacific Championship in Auckland in February 2013. Luxford continued her strong 2013 season with a second-place finish at the Ironman 70.3 European Championship in Wiesbaden and a third place a month later at the 2013 Ironman 70.3 World Championship. The following year, in 2014, against strong, competitive fields she took 2nd place at both the Ironman 70.3 Asia-Pacific Championship and at the Abu Dhabi International Triathlon. She also claimed the Ironman 70.3 Australian Championship title in Mandurah; however, a collision with a car whilst training meant that in her second 70.3 World Championship appearance she was unable <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>her</b> finish from the previous year, finishing 11th in Mont-Tremblant. In 2015, Luxford began working part-time in digital communications at the National Australia Bank in Melbourne whilst continuing training and competing. That year she competed in her first Ironman, finishing 6th at Ironman Asia-Pacific Championship in Melbourne and raced as a rookie at the Ironman World Championships in Kona, finishing 12th.

25|$|The race {{had several}} attacks, the first {{meaningful}} one coming in only lap five from Aksana Papko of Belarus {{in an early}} bid <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>her</b> countryman Aliaksandr Lisouski's victory in the men's race on day one. She was chased down by a small group that included Svetlanan Paulikaite of Lithuania, Svitlana Halyuk of Ukraine and Ellen van Dijk of the Netherlands. The rest of the bunch was very attentive {{at this early stage}} and they were soon back together. Paulikaite struck out alone, but her effort did not come to anything. A crash in the middle period of the race took down Catherine Cheatley of New Zealand and Spain's Gema Pascual Torrecilla after a touch of wheels near the back. Cheatley rejoined after a few minutes, but Torrecilla pulled out having fallen more heavily. More attacks continued, but all were reeled. With less than eight laps to go, Van Dijk struck out alone and no one else reacted. She overtook the Danish rider Trine Schmidt from an earlier escape and had soon almost half lap lead. The rest of the riders did not react and looked to each other. Despite having almost half a lap {{on the rest of the}} bunch, Van Dijk refused to start getting complacent and kept going. When a chase did materialise, it was too late and Van Dijk finished alone with a considerable gap to take the gold medal and the rainbow jersey. Behind Van Dijk the sprint was won by the 2007 champion Yumari Gonzalez Valdivieso of Cuba, ahead of Belinda Goss from Australia. Annalisa Cucinotta of Italy was fourth and Rebecca Quinn from the United States of America finished fifth.|$|E

Chapman had received the microphone from Kennedy as a loan, as a [...] "try this for a while" [...] experiment. Although he previously had tested numerous microphones on Swift, {{he had not been}} able to find one <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>her</b> voice perfectly. When Swift came to Chapman's home to record a radio edit for one of the singles from Taylor Swift, she immediately grew fond of the microphone. [...] "When she put on the headphones and said, 'Test,' completely unprompted, she said, 'This is my mic. I love this mic. I just wanna use this one from now on!' She had no idea what it was, just loved it, and I went along with something that felt right for her. We've been using it ever since, and it sounds great on her voice," [...] Chapman said.|$|E

Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter also gave it a positive review calling the film: [...] "A tender, often humorous tale with sparkling performances."

Her crew, {{and that of the}} , joined the Kronstadt Rebellion of March 1921. After it was bloodily crushed, those ships were given proper 'revolutionary' names. The other two serviceable vessels were recommissioned and renamed in 1925–26 while some work was done to repair Frunze, as Poltava was now known, but the money quickly ran out for her repairs. Parizhskaya Kommuna, the former Sevastopol, was modified in 1928 to improve her sea-keeping abilities so that she could be transferred to the Black Sea Fleet which had nothing heavier than a light cruiser available. This proved to be {{the first of a series}} of modernizations where each ship of the class was progressively reconstructed and improved. A number of proposals were made in the 1930s to rebuild Frunze <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>her</b> sisters or even as a battlecruiser by removing one turret, but these came to naught and she was hulked preparatory to scrapping.|$|E
500|$|The North Jersey Media Group {{gave the}} DVD 2.5starts out of five, saying that Madonna {{felt to be}} [...] "overly" [...] {{attached}} to her contemporary songs than her classic releases. They added [...] "that plodding through overlong arrangements of inconsequential songs— from the annoyingly vocoder-treated 'Revolver' early to the throwaway dance cut 'Celebration' at the end— will leave listeners wondering why so many substantial hits were given only a nod, if anything at all." [...] A review by Kevin Taft in online website [...] "Edge on the Net" [...] was overall negative. Taft noticed that Madonna's vocals were altered and mixed {{so much that it}} sounded disembodied and did not match the singer's lips. He was [...] "shocked" [...] to find that the audio CDs also contained the badly mixed songs. The reviewer explained that [...] "The choice to have the backing track turned down so low doesn't help much either. In fact, it makes it sound as if Madonna is on a cabaret stage with a five-piece band... For the six months it took Madge to edit her concert, one would wish she got her vocals <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>her</b> lips." [...] However, Taft commended the overall show and the technical brilliance accompanying it.|$|E

In Entertainment Weekly, Danyel Smith wrote that [...] "what began on Butterfly as a departure ends up on Rainbow a progression – perhaps the first compelling proof of Carey's true colors as an artist." [...] Arion Berger from Rolling Stone viewed it as a genuine R and hip hop album, a [...] "sterling chronicle {{of the state of}} accessible hip-hop balladeering at the close of 1999." [...] Aside from calling some of the ballads [...] "banal", Berger concluded his review that [...] "Rainbow is at its best—and Carey at her most comfortable—when urbane hip-hop stylings and faux R coexist in smooth middle-of-the-road harmony." [...] Elysa Gardner from the Los Angeles Times wrote in her review: [...] "Exhibiting an emotional authority <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>her</b> technical prowess, Carey gives us a vision of love that's dynamic without being ostentatious". Steve Jones from USA Today deemed the record [...] "colorful" [...] and [...] "some of her most compelling work." [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau gave the album a two-star honorable mention, indicating a [...] "likable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy".
