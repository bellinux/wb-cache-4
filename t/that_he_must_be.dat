5|$|During {{the winter}} {{solstice}} meeting, the gods are finally convinced by Artemis {{to take action against}} the Titans. Thalia is also asked by Artemis to become an immortal Huntress, and her acceptance {{is the only thing that}} prevents the onset of the Great Prophecy. Percy is told by his father that Luke is somehow not dead, and he and Annabeth return to Camp Half-Blood worried about the future. Before he can relax, however, Percy is forced to explain Bianca's death to Nico. Nico blames Percy, and when a group of spartoi arrive to attack the son of Poseidon, Nico banishes them to the realm of Hades, and Percy realizes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> a son of Hades. Nico runs away, and the only people Percy tells the truth are Annabeth and Grover. They promise to hide this fact from everyone else, especially the Titan's army.|$|E
5|$|Graham visits Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) and {{describes}} his visions, to which Henry replies <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> the queen's Huntsman. The Huntsman {{was hired by}} the Evil Queen to remove Snow White's heart and bring it back to her, but when he does not do so, she removes his heart. Graham later attempts to explain to Emma that he could not feel anything with Regina because he does not have a heart. Graham and Emma then encounter the wolf from Graham's visions, and follow it to a graveyard and vault marked with a symbol Graham saw in his visions and in Henry's book. Looking for his heart, Graham fervently searches the vault, which {{turns out to be the}} tomb of Henry Mills. Regina arrives to place flowers on her father's grave and is furious to find them there.|$|E

25|$|On August 26, 2011, the Constitutional Court ruled <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> extradited to the United States. He {{would then}} be the first former Guatemalan President to stand {{prosecution}} in the United States. He was extradited to the United States on May 24, 2013 to face money laundering charges. He is accused of laundering US$70 million of Guatemalan money through US banks.|$|E
25|$|Some years later, a {{prominent}} Muslim leader and scholar, Ahmed Raza Khan, was {{to travel to}} the Hejaz to collect the opinions of the religious scholars of Mecca and Madina. He compiled these opinions in his work Hussam ul Harmain (The sword of two sanctuaries on the slaughter-point of blasphemy and falsehood); in it, Ghulam Ahmad was again labelled an apostate. The unanimous consensus of about thirty-four religious scholars was that Ghulam Ahmad's beliefs were blasphemous and tantamount to apostasy and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> punished by imprisonment and, if necessary, by execution.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, Goring had {{no desire}} to lose the {{independent}} command that he had extorted at Stow-on-the-Wold in May. Still, it was clear <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> disposed of, as quickly as possible. On 26 June, Fairfax requested the Houses to take other measures against the King. This, they did by paying up the arrears due to Leven's army, and bringing it to the Severn valley. On 8 July, Leven reached Alcester, bringing with him a Parliamentarian force from Derbyshire, under Sir John Gell. The design was to besiege Hereford.|$|E
25|$|Protagoras {{was born}} in Abdera, Thrace, {{opposite}} the island of Thasos (today part of the Xanthi regional unit). According to Aulus Gellius, he originally made his living as a porter, but one day he was seen by the philosopher Democritus carrying a load of small pieces of wood he had tied with a short cord. Democritus realized that Protagoras had tied the load together with such perfect geometric accuracy <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> a mathematical prodigy. Democritus promptly took him into his own household and taught him philosophy. Protagoras became well known in Athens and even became a friend of Pericles.|$|E
25|$|After {{meeting with}} Pizarro, Rocco reenters and tells Fidelio that Pizarro {{will allow the}} marriage, and Fidelio will also be {{permitted}} to join Rocco on his rounds in the dungeon (Nun sprecht, wie ging's?—"Speak, how did it go?"). Rocco and Fidelio prepare to go to Florestan's cell, with the knowledge <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> killed and buried within the hour. Fidelio is shaken; Rocco tries to discourage Fidelio from coming, but Fidelio insists. As they prepare to leave, Jaquino and Marzelline rush in and tell Rocco to run, as Pizarro has learned that the prisoners were allowed to roam, and is furious (Ach, Vater, Vater, eilt!—"O, father, father, hurry!").|$|E

25|$|Carlos flees by {{shifting}} to the timeline that the copies of Diana and Sigma had been transported to. Diana and Sigma reach {{a room with}} sleeping pods, where they find and wake up Eric and Sean, and find the dead bodies of the remaining participants. Armed with a shotgun, Eric demands to know who killed Mira; Carlos says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> innocent {{as he was in}} the C Ward, but Diana realizes that the wards are not separate: there is only one lounge, which changes its appearance using projection mapping. They realize that only one team is active at a time, while the rest are kept asleep in the pods. Sean reveals Zero's true identity: he is Delta, an elderly man thought to be wheelchair-bound, deaf, blind and mute, who had been with Q-Team the entire time, but off-camera from the player's perspective. He admits that he killed Mira, and prevents the participants from escaping by using his esper abilities to make Eric shoot everyone but Diana.|$|E
25|$|Hoyos did {{not look}} any closer, but rushed to the station and took a special train to Vienna. He hurried to the Emperor's Adjutant General, Count Paar, and {{requested}} him to break the appalling news to the Emperor. The stifling protocol that characterized every movement in the Hofburg swung ponderously into action; Paar remonstrated that only the Empress could break such catastrophic news to the Emperor. Baron Nopcsa, Controller of the Empress's Household, was sent for, and he in turn sent for Countess Ida Ferenczy, Empress Elisabeth's favorite Hungarian lady-in-waiting, to determine how Her Majesty should be informed. Elisabeth was at her Greek lesson, and was impatient at the interruption. White to the lips, Ferenczy announced that Baron Nopcsa had urgent news. Elisabeth replied that he must wait and come back later. The countess insisted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> received immediately, finally being forced to add that there was grave news about the Crown Prince. This account comes from Ferenczy herself and Archduchess Marie Valerie, to whom Elisabeth dictated her memory of the incident, {{in addition to the}} description in her diary.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses {{who came}} forward {{said that on}} the evening of 30 November, they had seen an {{individual}} resembling the dead man lying on his back in the same spot and position near the Crippled Children's Home where the corpse was later found. A couple who saw him at around 7pm noted that they saw him extend his right arm to its fullest extent and then drop it limply. Another couple who saw him from 7:30pm to 8pm, during which time the street lights had come on, recounted that they did not see him move during the half an hour in which he was in view, although they did have the impression that his position had changed. Although they commented between themselves <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> dead because he was not reacting to the mosquitoes, they had thought it more likely that he was drunk or asleep, and thus did not investigate further. One of the witnesses told the police she observed a man looking down at the sleeping man {{from the top of the}} steps that lead to the beach. Witnesses said the body was in the same position when the police viewed it.|$|E

25|$|Good fortune came to {{the rescue}} when Casanova, unhappy with his lot as a musician, saved the life of a Venetian nobleman of the Bragadin family, who had a stroke while riding with Casanova in a gondola after a wedding ball. They {{immediately}} stopped to have the senator bled. Then, at the senator's palace, a physician bled the senator again and applied an ointment of mercury to the senator's chest (mercury was an all-purpose but toxic remedy of the time). The mercury raised his temperature and induced a massive fever, and Bragadin appeared to be choking on his own swollen windpipe. A priest was called as death seemed to be approaching. However, despite protests from the attending physician, Casanova ordered the removal of the ointment and the washing of the senator's chest with cool water. The senator recovered from his illness with rest and a sensible diet. Because of his youth and his facile recitation of medical knowledge, the senator and his two bachelor friends thought Casanova wise beyond his years, and concluded <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> in possession of occult knowledge. As they were cabalists themselves, the senator invited Casanova into his household and became a lifelong patron.|$|E
25|$|On October 28, 2010, the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals {{overturned}} two of {{the three}} remaining mail fraud counts. It left Black convicted of one count of mail fraud, of which his portion was $285,000 (USD), and one count of obstruction of justice. The court also ruled <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> resentenced. On December 17, 2010, Black lost an appeal of his remaining convictions for fraud and obstruction of justice. The three-person panel did not provide reasons. On May 31, 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to grant Black leave to appeal his two remaining convictions without any comment. Resentencing on the two remaining counts by the original trial judge occurred on June 24, 2011. Black's lawyers recommended that he be sentenced to the 29 months he has already served, while the prosecution argued for Black to complete his original 6 1/2 year sentence. The probation officer's report recommends a sentence of between 33 and 41 months. On that date, Judge St. Eve resentenced him to a reduced term of 42 months and a fine of $150,000 returning him to prison to serve the remaining 13 months of his sentence.|$|E
25|$|Stacey {{decides not to}} tell Ryan <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> {{the father}} of her baby. He {{exhibits}} a romantic interest in her, which is later revealed {{to be part of a}} bet with his girlfriend Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). Upset by this revelation, Stacey's waters break. Ryan stays with her as she gives birth to a daughter, whom she names Lily. When Ryan later rescues them from a fire at The Queen Victoria pub, Stacey admits that he is Lily's father. Ryan initially refuses to act as a parent to her, but bonds with her when Stacey and a jealous Janine are arrested for fighting during a night out. Janine's jealousy escalates to kidnapping Lily, but Ryan convinces her to return her. Stacey and Ryan grow closer, spending time together, and they passionately kiss. During this time, Lauren (now Jacqueline Jossa) discovers Stacey's guilt in Archie's death and records a confession on her phone. Stacey attempts to flee to Palma, Majorca, but Ryan stops her, telling her he has feelings for her and wants to date her. They start an affair, but unbeknownst to them, Janine finds out, who poisons Ryan in revenge. Ryan is hospitalised and on his return, he convinces Janine he loves her but publicly declares his love for Stacey in The Queen Victoria. Janine walks in as they are in a passionate embrace. She concedes defeat until Lauren, who still believes Max is emotionally involved with Stacey, gives Janine the recorded confession. The next day, Janine attempts to play the recording in front of punters in The Queen Victoria, but it has been recorded over because Lauren warned Max. Janine says that Stacey killed Archie but no one believes her. Stacey leaves the pub in tears, followed by Ryan. She then breaks down and tells Ryan that Janine said the truth.|$|E

500|$|While Superman is busy saving others, Lois's car ends up {{falling into}} a crevice that opens {{from one of the}} aftershocks. It fills with dirt and debris and she suffocates to death. Angered at being unable to save her, Superman defies Jor-El's earlier warning not to {{manipulate}} human history, preferring to heed Jonathan's advice <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> here for [...] "a reason". He accelerates around Earth, rewinding time, to save Lois. After bringing Luthor and Otis to prison, he flies into the sunrise for further adventures.|$|E

500|$|Owing to Kurosawa's {{popularity}} with European and American audiences {{from the early}} 1950s onward, he has not escaped the charge of deliberately catering to the tastes of Westerners to achieve or maintain that popularity. Joan Mellen, recording the violently negative reaction (in the 1970s) of the left-wing director Nagisa Oshima to Kurosawa and his work, states: [...] "That Kurosawa had brought Japanese film to a Western audience meant [...] <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> pandering to Western values and politics." [...] Kurosawa always strongly denied pandering to Western tastes: [...] "He has never catered to a foreign audience" [...] writes Audie Bock, [...] "and has condemned those who do".|$|E
