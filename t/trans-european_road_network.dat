Speeds are represented in octilinear cartograms which constitutes one of the novelties of this study. Octilinear cartograms {{have the advantage of}} simplifying the geographical representation of transport networks, while emphasizing the connections (nodes) and the links between those nodes. The geographical accurateness is no longer important in this type of map; thus, the actual length of links does not correspond to the link's real value, directions are roughly preserved and scale factor is not constant for the entire map. Results show a general improvement of speeds in the Core Network. During {{the first years of the}} analysed period, speeds increased in Western European countries, while in the latest years, this improvement was extended to peripheral countries. By 2012, travel speeds presented a more homogeneous pattern all over Europe, generally ranging between 100 and 110  km/h.

40|$|Abstract:- To {{provide more}} {{reliable}} service for drivers, {{it is necessary}} to establish an optimization framework in which a reliability index is adopted as a performance index to evaluate <b>road</b> <b>networks.</b> First, a modified four-level model of unblocked reliability (link, path, Origin-Destination pair and entire <b>road</b> <b>network)</b> is proposed, in which the unblocked reliabilities of the Origin-Destination pair and the entire <b>road</b> <b>network</b> are formulated by the law of total probability when the unblocked reliability of path is a conditional probability. Then, a bi-level program is established based on the new model of unblocked reliability since planners design the <b>road</b> <b>network</b> and drivers respond the change in the <b>road</b> <b>network.</b> The objective function of the upper-level program is the maximized balance between the unblocked reliability of the entire <b>road</b> <b>network</b> and the <b>road</b> <b>network</b> expansion ratio which implies cost of improving the <b>road</b> <b>network.</b> The program equivalent of Stochastic User Equilibrium is adopted as the lower-level model so as to achieve consistency in route choices and to model the congestion effect in the <b>road</b> <b>network.</b> Next, a set of link capacity expansions is determined as a planning scheme by solving the bi-level program. This planning scheme not only improves the link of lower reliability but also takes into account the performance of the Origin-Destination pair and the entire <b>road</b> <b>network.</b> The proposed optimization framework is capable of improving the <b>road</b> <b>network</b> to its highest possible reliability level with a minimum scale of <b>road</b> <b>network</b> expansion...|$|R

40|$|<b>Road</b> <b>network</b> {{robustness}} is {{the ability}} of a <b>road</b> <b>network</b> to operate correctly under a wide range of attacks. A structural robustness analysis can describe the survivability of a city <b>road</b> <b>network</b> that is under attack and can help improve functions such as urban planning and emergency response. In this paper, a novel approach is presented to quantitatively evaluate <b>road</b> <b>network</b> robustness based on the community structure derived from a city <b>road</b> <b>network,</b> in which communities refer to those densely connected subsets of nodes that are sparsely linked to the remaining <b>network.</b> First, a <b>road</b> <b>network</b> is reconstructed into a set of connected communities. Then, successive simulated attacks are conducted on the reconstructed <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> to test the performance of the networks under attack. The performance of the networks is represented by efficiency and the occurrence of fragmentation. Three attack strategies, including a random attack and two intentional attacks, are performed to evaluate the survivability of the <b>road</b> <b>network</b> under different situations. Contrary to the traditional road segment-based approach, the community-based robustness analysis on a city <b>road</b> <b>network</b> shows distinct structural diversity between communities, providing greater insight into network vulnerability under intentional attacks. Six typical city <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> on three different continents are used to demonstrate the proposed approach. The evaluation results reveal an important feature of the structure of city <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> from a community-based perspective, i. e., that the structure is robust under random failure but fragile under intentional attack. This result is highly consistent in different city <b>road</b> <b>network</b> forms. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|With {{the share}} of over 80%, the road freight and {{passenger}} transport constitutes the largest part of transport in Slovenia. Personal cars are much more popular than public road passenger transport, which has significantly declined. Motorways and expressways, operated by the Motorway Company in the Republic of Slovenia, are the state roads of the highest category. On motorways and express ways, cars must have a toll sticker. Slovenia has a very high motorway density compared to the European Union average. The first highway in Slovenia, the A1 motorway connecting Vrhnika and Postojna, was opened in 1972, but the construction was really speed up in 1994, when the National Assembly enacted the first National Motorway Construction Programme. Till February 2012, a network consisting of 528 km of motorways, expressways and similar roads has been built. Its essential section, the Slovenian Motorway Cross, {{which is part of}} the <b>Trans-European</b> <b>Road</b> <b>network,</b> was completed in October 2011. It comprises the motorway route heading from east to west, in line with the Pan-European Corridor V, and the motorway route heading in the north-south direction, in line with the Pan-European Corridor X, part of which is considered the Slovenian transport backbone. The newly built road system slowly, but steadily transforms Slovenia into a large conurbation and connects it as a unitary social, economic and cultural space, with links to neighbouring areas. In contrast, other state roads, managed by the Slovenian Infrastructure Agency (until January 2015 named Slovenian Roads Agency), have been rapidly deteriorating due to neglection and the overall increase in traffic. About half of them are in a bad condition. The urban and suburban network served by buses is relatively dense.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{reference}} law for {{the construction}} of new tunnels belonging to the <b>Trans-European</b> <b>Road</b> <b>Network</b> currently calls for the implementation of emergency exits when the expected traffic in the tunnel is larger than 2000 vehicles/hour per lane and the length of the tunnel is more than 1000 m. Emergency exits must allow the road users to abandon the tunnel afoot and in safety and to reach a safe place in case of accident or fire. Apart from allowing pedestrian flow outside the tunnel, such exits also have to provide a pedestrian route for access to the tunnel by first aid services. Emergency exits can provide a path toward an emergency tunnel which leads pedestrians to the outside or to shelters with escape routes separated by the tube of the tunnel. The Italian legislative decree n. 264, published on October 5 th, 2006, imposes that the distance between emergency exits must not exceed 500 m. Sizing emergency exits can be submitted to the application of the technical norms of prevention and protection by fires. The legislation related to the minimum safety requirements for tunnels of the <b>Trans-European</b> <b>Road</b> <b>Network</b> does not clearly state anything concerning this aspect. This paper proposes a methodology for the verification of correct spatial positioning and sizing of the width of emergency exits of road tunnels, considering such width {{as a function of the}} expected vehicular flow for the tunnel, the distance between two emergency exits, the number of lanes in the tunnel and the average coefficient of occupation of the transiting vehicles...|$|E
