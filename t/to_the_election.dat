5|$|Baxter had {{now been}} {{governor}} {{for a year}} and was following an independent course. He began dismantling the systems put in place by the Minstrels. He appointed honest Democrats and Republicans <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Election</b> Commission, reorganized the militia by placing it {{under the control of the}} State, rather than the governor, and pushed for an amendment to the state constitution to re-enfranchise ex-Confederates.|$|E

5|$|Bolivia's U.S. embassy {{had become}} {{publicly}} {{highly critical of}} Morales; just prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia Manuel Rocha issued a statement declaring that U.S. aid to Bolivia would be cut if MAS won the election. However, exit polls revealed that Rocha's comments had served to increase support for Morales. Following the election, the U.S. embassy maintained this critical stance, characterising Morales as a criminal and encouraging Bolivia's traditional parties to sign a broad agreement to oppose the MAS; Morales himself began alleging that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was plotting to assassinate him.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{campaign}} faltered as {{the race}} {{drew to a}} close. Two weeks prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> Brown was injured in a fall at Leitchfield; {{as a result of}} the injury, he was confined to his home and unable to deliver campaign speeches, despite several attempts to allow him to speak from a chair or wheelchair. The final vote count gave Republican William S. Taylor a small plurality with 193,714 votes to Goebel's 191,331; Brown garnered only 12,140 votes.|$|E

5|$|Chapman left Portland in 1853 for Fort Umpqua in Southern Oregon. There he {{engaged in}} cattle {{ranching}} while keeping his Portland law practice. He {{served as a}} lieutenant colonel in the militia during the Rogue River War that was fought from 1855 to 1856 against the Native Americans in Southern Oregon. After the war he returned to Corvallis in 1856 before moving to Eugene in 1857. Chapman was appointed as surveyor general of Oregon and served from 1857 to 1861 {{when he returned to}} Portland. He left this federal government position due to his opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. President. Oregon entered the Union as the 33rd state in 1859.|$|E
5|$|During {{the general}} election, Humphrey faced former Vice President Richard Nixon of New York, the Republican Party nominee. Nixon led in most polls {{throughout}} the campaign, and successfully criticized Humphrey's role in Vietnam, connecting {{him to the}} unpopular president and the general disorder in the nation. Humphrey experienced a surge in the polls in the days prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> largely due to incremental progress {{in the peace process}} in Vietnam and a break with the Johnson war policy, but was defeated by Nixon on Election Day.|$|E
5|$|Emanuel's {{eligibility}} for office was challenged {{on the basis}} of his lack of residency in Chicago for one year prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> The Board of Elections and the Cook County Circuit Court affirmed his eligibility. A divided Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court, holding on January 24, 2011, that residency for purposes of a candidate is different from residency for purposes of being a voter. A further appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court resulted in a unanimous decision reversing the Court of Appeals and affirming Emanuel's eligibility.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Powell {{was elected to}} the U.S. Senate. Before he could assume office, President James Buchanan {{dispatched}} Powell and Major Benjamin McCulloch to Utah to ease tensions with Brigham Young and the Mormons. Powell assumed his Senate seat on his return from Utah, just prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> of Abraham Lincoln as president. Powell became an outspoken critic of Lincoln's administration, {{so much so that the}} Kentucky General Assembly asked for his resignation and some of his fellow senators tried to have him expelled from the body. Both groups later renounced their actions.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Taylor/Fillmore ticket won narrowly, with New York's {{electoral votes}} again key <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> The Whig ticket won {{the popular vote}} by 1,361,393 (47.3 percent) to 1,223,460 (42.5 percent), and triumphed 163 to 127 in the Electoral College. Minor party {{candidates}} took no electoral votes, but {{the strength of the}} burgeoning anti-slavery movement was shown by the vote for Van Buren, who though he won no states earned 291,501 votes (10.1 percent) and finished second in New York, Vermont and Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Brooks ran for {{governor}} representing the Brindle Tails. Brooks was a very vocal supporter of civil rights for former slaves, but also a supporter of re-enfranchisement for ex-Confederates, which was the sentiment nationally of Liberal Republicans. When the Democrats met, they agreed not only to not run a candidate, but even to support Joseph Brooks, {{as long as the}} election was fair and legal, since elections in the state had been wrought with fraud for five years. The issue of re-enfranchisement of Confederates was central <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E

In 1153, Osbert deposed Murdac's choice as abbot of Selby and appointed another abbot. Originally, Osbert had supported Elias Paynel, Murdac's choice for abbot, but then changed his stance and helped with the deposition.|$|E

A poll conducted in May by the Republican Governors Association showed Brown leading Jeanne Shaheen by 5 points. In late August, a WMUR/UNH poll showed Shaheen leading Brown by two points, 46 to 44. Polling {{in the final}} few weeks of the election suggested Brown had pulled ahead of Shaheen, with weekly polls by NH1 News, New England College, and Vox Populi showing Brown leading {{by a margin of}} 1–4 percentage points for the three consecutive weeks leading up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> Dato' Onn Ja'afar {{had changed}} his approach, forming the Parti Negara after IMP {{suffered}} crushing losses to the Alliance in local elections. Advocating stronger pro-Malay policies recognising Malay political dominance, the Parti Negara failed to shake the Alliance's grip on power. However, some believe Parti Negara's proposals helped sway UMNO politicians towards more radically pro-Malay policies. The British themselves insisted on handing over power only to a multiracial government, and the Alliance was considered to meet this requirement.|$|E

After {{employees of the}} Liquor Control and Licensing Branch told Ince that the art installation would likely result in the refusal of a special event liquor licence, the party asked for judicial review. Both a provincial court and an appeal court refused the review because an actual application had not been submitted for a decision to be reviewed, and the fundraiser went ahead with the serving of alcohol.|$|E

With victories in 2006 and in 2010, Reinfeldt was the Moderate Party's longest-serving prime minister and the only person to lead the party to two consecutive general election victories. His Government compromised four parties (including his own) which prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> had formed a coalition named Alliance for Sweden, later turned into the Alliance.|$|E
