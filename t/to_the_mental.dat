Lois continues to make crazy excuses, still wanting to believe her brother is a sane person, but ultimately she snaps out of her denial and realizes that Patrick is dangerous. Lois and Brian pursue Patrick and Peter into the woods, where Patrick is strangling Peter. Patrick quickly releases Peter after Lois threatens to stab Marion, his imaginary wife.

Afterwards, Thor and Jane discover another portal in a nearby cave and reunite in London with Darcy and Jane's mentor Dr. Erik Selvig — who was briefly institutionalized due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> trauma he suffered during Loki's attack on Earth. They learn that Malekith plans to restore the Dark Elves to dominance by unleashing the Aether {{at the center of}} the Convergence in Greenwich. Thor battles Malekith through various portals and across multiple worlds until one portal separates them, leaving Malekith unopposed on Earth. Thor returns in time to help his mortal comrades use their scientific equipment to transport Malekith to Svartalfheim, where he is crushed by his own damaged ship.|$|E

40|$|Abstract, The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyze Edgar Allan Poe’s Annabel Lee. <b>The</b> writer intends <b>to</b> {{describe}} <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> state which <b>the</b> narrator endures upon Annabel Lee’s death. The writer discusses figurative language, namely symbol and irony, <b>to</b> describe <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> state in <b>the</b> poem. The writer adopts Sigmund Freud’s theory of levels of mental life and id ego superego, and John lee’s theory of obesessive love <b>to</b> describe <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> state. <b>The</b> methods of her intrinsic and the extrinsic discussion are applied through book observation, library research, and the internet browsing. The result shows that in a love relationship {{there are two kinds}} of moments, happy and sad one. This final academic paper shows that the death of the beloved one greatly affects the narrator’s life; he loses his self control and becomes deppressed...|$|R
