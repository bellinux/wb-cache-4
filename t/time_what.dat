5|$|Æthelberht built Justus {{a cathedral}} church in Rochester; the {{foundations}} of a nave and chancel partly underneath the present-day Rochester Cathedral may date from that <b>time.</b> <b>What</b> remains of {{the foundations of}} an early rectangular building near {{the southern part of}} the current cathedral might also be contemporary with Justus or may be part of a Roman building.|$|E
5|$|NY345 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, it originally followed a different alignment south of the hamlet of Madrid. At the <b>time,</b> <b>what</b> is now NY345 between Madrid and Potsdam was part of NY56A. The NY56A designation was eliminated in 1980. NY345 was realigned two years later to follow old NY56A to Potsdam {{as a result of a}} highway maintenance swap between the state of New York and St. Lawrence County. Ownership and maintenance of NY345's original routing south of Madrid was transferred from the state to the county and the village of Canton {{as part of the}} exchange.|$|E

5|$|The {{section of}} the present route between New Castle and Wilmington was {{constructed}} as the New Castle and Wilmington Turnpike, a private turnpike, in 1813. What would become DE 9 originally existed as a county road by 1920. Four years later, the road between Leipsic and Smyrna was upgraded to a state highway. In addition, the current alignment of DE9 around Taylors Bridge and between Delaware City and Wilmington was paved. In 1931, what would become DE9 was upgraded to a state highway between Bay Road and Little Creek and between Port Penn and Delaware City. A year later, the road became a state highway between Delaware City and Wilmington. By this <b>time,</b> <b>what</b> would become DE 9 between Little Creek and Leipsic was upgraded to a state highway.|$|E
5|$|By 1920, {{what would}} {{originally}} become DE 404 was an unimproved county road, with the section east of Bridgeville under contract {{as a state}} highway. The entire route of what would become DE 404 was completed as a state highway to a point northwest of Bridgeville by 1924. By 1931, the road was built as a state highway northwest to the Maryland border. DE 404 was designated to run from the Maryland border, where it connected to MD 404, southeast to DE 18 southeast of Bridgeville by 1936. The route followed its current alignment to Bridgeville, where it passed through the town on Market Street and South Main Street before picking up its current alignment east of US 13. At this <b>time,</b> <b>what</b> is now DE 404 past its then-eastern terminus was designated as part of DE 18. By 1987, DE 404 was extended east to DE 1 in Five Points, following DE 18 to Georgetown and US 9 (which had replaced a portion of DE 18) from Georgetown to Five Points. DE 404 Alt. was created to bypass Bridgeville {{to the north and}} east by 1990, following Newton Road and US 13. The alternate route became a part of mainline DE 404 by 1999, with the former DE 404 through Bridgeville becoming DE 404 Bus.|$|E
5|$|On {{the table}} are various {{other pieces of}} {{equipment}} that the natural philosopher would have used during his demonstration: a thermometer, candle snuffer and cork, {{and close to the}} man seated to the right is a pair of Magdeburg hemispheres, which would have been used with the air pump to demonstrate the difference in pressure exerted by the air and a vacuum: when the air was pumped out from between the two hemispheres they were impossible to pull apart. The air pump itself is rendered in exquisite detail, a faithful record of the designs in use at the <b>time.</b> <b>What</b> may be a human skull in the large liquid-filled glass bowl would not have been a normal piece of equipment; William Schupbach suggests that it and the candle, which is presumably lighting the bowl from behind, form a vanitas—the two symbols of mortality reflecting the cockatoo's struggle for life.|$|E

5|$|The first {{segments}} of M-114 were completed by January 1, 1930, and {{ran along the}} west side of Grand Rapids, on what is now Wilson Avenue between Lake Michigan Drive and Leonard Street. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>what</b> would become a spur was also finished from the town of Cascade to US131 (Division Avenue). By July 1 that same year, the southern segment was extended west to Clyde Park Avenue in Wyoming Township. By the end of 1936 M-114 was a three-legged trunkline around the Grand Rapids area. It started at US16 in Walker Township and ran south to Grandville where it turned to run eastward to the community of Cascade. The third leg was shown on maps as under construction from a junction in Paris Township north to a junction with US16 in East Grand Rapids; the trunkline continued north from US16 to a junction with US131 in Plainfield Township north of Grand Rapids.|$|E

In record <b>time,</b> <b>what</b> once was the most pro-nuclear German government in decades prepared comprehensive legislation to phase out the remaining nine reactors by 2022 at the latest, starting in 2015.

25|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda-affiliated hijackers flew two Boeing 767 jets into the North and South Towers within minutes of each other; two hours later, both had collapsed. The attacks killed 2,606 people in and within the {{vicinity}} of the towers, as well as all 157 on board the two aircraft. Falling debris from the towers, combined with fires that the debris initiated in several surrounding buildings, led to the partial or complete collapse of all the other buildings in the complex and caused catastrophic damage to ten other large structures in the surrounding area. The cleanup and recovery process at the World Trade Center site took eight months, during which <b>time</b> <b>what</b> remained of the other World Trade Center buildings was demolished.|$|E
