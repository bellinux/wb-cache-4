5000|$|Trandolapril is a prodrug that is de-esterified to <b>trandolaprilat.</b> It is {{believed}} to exert its antihypertensive effect through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Trandolapril has a half-life of about 6 hours, and <b>trandolaprilat</b> has a half life of about 10 h. <b>Trandolaprilat</b> has about eight times the activity of its parent drug. About one-third of trandolapril and its metabolites are excreted in the urine, and about two-thirds of trandolapril and its metabolites are excreted in the feces. Serum protein binding of trandolapril is about 80%.|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to investigate the mechanism underlying the endothelium-dependent relaxation to <b>trandolaprilat,</b> a converting enzyme inhibitor, in canine coronary arteries previously exposed to bradykinin. Rings suspended in organ chambers were exposed to bradykinin for 3 min and washed repeatedly for 150 min. <b>Trandolaprilat</b> caused relaxations [IC 50 (- log M) 8. 59] in rings with endothelium previously exposed to bradykinin. This response was observed already at concentrations where <b>trandolaprilat</b> did not augment relaxations to bradykinin. When the rings were exposed to acetylcholine or to Des-Arg 9 -bradykinin (B 1 agonist) <b>trandolaprilat</b> caused only a minimal response. Carboxypeptidase B but not aprotinin impaired the relaxation to <b>trandolaprilat,</b> suggesting a contribution of bradykinin. After exposure to [3 H]-bradykinin, no detectable amounts of the peptide were released by <b>trandolaprilat</b> or found in the preparations. The relaxation to <b>trandolaprilat</b> was not affected by the B 1 antagonist Leu 8 -des-Arg 9 - bradykinin. HOE- 140, a B 2 antagonist impaired the maximal response to <b>trandolaprilat,</b> while exhibiting competitive antagonism against bradykinin (pA 2 9. 00). The maximal relaxation to <b>trandolaprilat</b> was impaired {{in the presence of}} nitro-L-arginine and methylene blue. The potency, but not the maximal effect of bradykinin was reduced by these inhibitors. Exogenous bradykinin, but not <b>trandolaprilat,</b> caused an endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization. At equipotent submaximal concentrations, bradykinin released both nitric oxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor although <b>trandolaprilat</b> stimulated the production of nitric oxide only. These findings suggest that acute endothelium-dependent relaxations to <b>trandolaprilat</b> in preparations previously exposed to bradykinin are mediated by nitric oxide and may be due partially to protection of bound bradykinin but also to some other unresolved mechanism(s) as well. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to {{study the effects of}} <b>trandolaprilat</b> on endothelium-dependent responses in isolated blood vessels. Rings of either femoral or left circumflex coronary arteries of the dog or thoracic aortas of normotensive rats were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. During contractions induced by prostaglandin F(2 α), <b>trandolaprilat</b> did not cause direct endothelium-dependent or independent relaxation. However, when given to preparations incubated with angiotensin I or bradykinin, the compound evoked significant endothelium-dependent relaxation. By contrast, <b>trandolaprilat</b> failed to cause any change in tension when given in the presence of acetylcholine (ACh). In rings of femoral arteries, <b>trandolaprilat</b> potentiated the endothelium-dependent relaxation evoked by bradykinin and adenosine diphosphate: it did not modify the endothelium-dependent relaxations, induced by ACh, substance P, or thrombin. In rings of femoral arteries without endothelium, <b>trandolaprilat</b> augmented relaxation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) but not by adenosine. In perfused coronary arteries with but not those without endothelium, <b>trandolaprilat</b> caused relaxation in the absence of exogenous bradykinin (or ADP). These experiments suggest that <b>trandolaprilat</b> does not directly release endothelium-derived relaxing factor from the endothelial cells, does not interfere with the ability of the endothelium to release endothelium-derived relaxing factor, augments the endothelium-dependent responses to bradykinin (given exogenously or produced locally) and angiotensin I by direct interaction with converting enzyme, and potentiates the relaxation induced by ADP by augmenting its direct effect on vascular smooth muscle. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|In canine {{coronary}} arteries, bradykinin evokes endothelium-dependent relaxations {{that are}} mediated by nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). The converting-enzyme inhibitor <b>trandolaprilat</b> potentiates the endothelium-dependent relaxations evoked by bradykinin in this tissue. The present experiments {{were designed to}} determine whether or not facilitated release of EDHF contributes to the augmented response to bradykinin in the presence of <b>trandolaprilat.</b> Organ-chamber studies were performed to measure changes in isometric tension in rings of canine coronary arteries. In the presence of nitro-L-arginine, an inhibitor of NO synthase, <b>trandolaprilat</b> augmented the endothelium-dependent relaxations evoked by bradykinin. These relaxations were not inhibited by the K+-channel inhibitors tetraethylammonium, 4 -aminopyricine, or glibenclamide, but were abolished in high-potassium solution. The membrane potential in individual smooth-muscle cells of coronary artery was measured by means of glass microelectrodes. <b>Trandolaprilat</b> potentiated the endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizations evoked by a subthreshold concentration of bradykinin, and these endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizations were inhibited by high- potassium solution. These experiments demonstrate that EDHF contributes to the relaxation evoked by bradykinin in the canine coronary artery and that <b>trandolaprilat</b> potentiates the release of this factor. This effect of <b>trandolaprilat</b> may contribute to its vasodilator properties. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has two natural {{substrates}} and two catalytic domains: one cleaving angiotensin I and one inactivating bradykinin. The aim of {{this study}} was to investigate the comparative binding affinity of ACE inhibitors for the two binding sites of human endothelial ACE. In vitro binding assays were performed to test the ability of bradykinin, angiotensin I, or various ACE inhibitors (enalaprilat, perindoprilat, quinaprilat, ramiprilat, and <b>trandolaprilat)</b> to displace a saturating concentration of [(125) I] 351 A, a radiolabeled lisinopril analogue, from ACE binding sites. The calculated IC(50) values for the ACE inhibitors were in the nanomolar range, while those for the natural substrates were in the micromolar range. The bradykinin/angiotensin I selectivity ratios calculated from double displacement experiments were: perindoprilat, 1. 44; ramiprilat, 1. 16; quinaprilat, 1. 09; <b>trandolaprilat,</b> 1. 08; enalaprilat, 1. 00. The ACE inhibitors generally had higher affinity for the bradykinin than the angiotensin I binding sites, supporting the idea that these agents are primarily inhibitors of bradykinin degradation, and secondarily inhibitors of angiotensin II production. Perindoprilat had the highest selectivity for bradykinin versus angiotensin I binding sites, and enalaprilat has the lowest. These results indicate that there are differences in the affinity of ACE inhibitors toward sites for bradykinin degradation, which could lead to differences in efficacy in cardiovascular disease...|$|E
40|$|Binding {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Ins) have high chemical affinity for binding sites of human somatic ACE (hsACE). The enzyme has 2 natural substrates and catalytic domains: one cleaving angiotensin-I (Ang-I) and the other inactivating bradykinin 1 - 9 (Bk). AIM: To test binding selectivity of various ACE-Ins - namely Enalaprilat (E), Perindoprilat (P), Quinaprilat (Q), Ramiprilat (R), <b>Trandolaprilat</b> (T) – for specific Ang-I and Bk binding sites of hsACE. Single displacement binding assays showed the following IC 50 for ACE-Ins and hsACE natural substrates: Q: 0. 35 nM, T: 0. 57 nM, R: 0. 76 nM, P: 1. 05 nM, E: 1. 94 nM, Ang-I: 2. 65 microM and Bk: 1. 31 microM. The order of binding affinity of ACE-Ins to hsACE is: Q>T>R>P>E; (2) All ACE-Ins have a higher affinity for Bk respect to Ang-I binding sites, the order of binding affinity being E>Q>T>R>P for Ang-I and Q>E>T>R>P for Bk binding sites, respectively; (3) P is the ACE-In with the highest selectivity for Bk versus Ang-I binding sites, (the order of Bk/Ang-I selectivity being P>R>Q>T>E). These results {{support the hypothesis that}} affinity differences of ACE-Ins towards sites for Bk degradation exist and may constitute the biochemical grounds in explaining differences obtained in secondary prevention of coronary artery disease...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{level of}} {{renal blood flow}} (RBF) is {{controlled}} by opposing vasoconstrictor and vasodilator influences. In a recent investigation in normotensive dogs, we found that combined blockade of endothelin type A (ETA) receptors and angiotensin II formation induces marked increases in RBF that were {{much larger than the}} effects of blocking either system alone. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the contribution of nitric oxide (NO) to this vasodilator response. Experiments were made in 6 conscious, chronically instrumented dogs subjected to 5 different experimental treatments on separate days. Blockade of ETA receptors alone by the selective antagonist LU 135252 had only minor effects on RBF compared with time-control experiments. Additional blockade of angiotensin II formation by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with <b>trandolaprilat</b> caused a substantial increase of RBF by ' 50 %. This vasodilation was entirely suppressed when NO formation was prevented by inhibition of NO synthase with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester HCl. However, when during NO synthase inhibition renal vascular NO concentrations were clamped at control levels by infusing the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine, the vasodilator response to combined blockade of ETA receptors and angiotensin II formation was completely restored (DRBF ' 60 %). These results indicate that the vasodilation after combined ETA receptor blockade and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition is not mediated by an increase in NO release but results from the unmasking of the tonic influence that is normally exerted by constitutively released NO. Accordingly, the tonic activity of endothelial NO synthase appears t...|$|E
