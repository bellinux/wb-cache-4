Basil of Ancyra and his party declared that <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> <b>was</b> of similar substance to the Father, following a (Homoiousian) Creed of Antioch from 341, and deposed the opposing party. Acacius of Caesarea declared that <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> <b>was</b> like <b>the</b> Father, introducing a new (Homoian) creed. <b>The</b> <b>Son</b> <b>was</b> begotten - generated from God's own substance.|$|R

25|$|In {{mainstream}} Christianity, Jesus Christ as God <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} Person of the Holy Trinity, {{due to his}} eternal relation to the first Person (God as Father).

25|$|Since early Christianity, {{a number}} of titles have been {{attributed}} to Jesus, including, Messiah (Christ) and the Son of God. Theologically, these are different attributions: Messiah refers to his fulfilling the expected Old Testament prophecies, while Son of God refers to a paternal relationship. God <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> <b>is</b> distinct from both Messiah and Son of God and its theology as part of the doctrine of the Trinity was formalized well over a century after those.|$|E

The angel tells Mary that Jesus will speak in infancy, and when mature, will be a companion to the most righteous. Mary, responding how she could conceive and have a child when no man had touched her, {{was told by the}} angel that God can decree what He wills, and it shall come to pass.|$|E
25|$|The Christology of {{the second}} section is more {{detailed}} {{than that of the}} Nicene Creed, and reflects the teaching of the First Council of Ephesus (431) and the definition of the Council of Chalcedon (451). The Athanasian Creed uses the term substantia (a Latin translation of the Nicene homoousios: 'same being' or 'consubstantial') not only with respect to the relation of the Son to the Father according to his divine nature, but also says <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> <b>is</b> substantia of his mother Mary according to his human nature.|$|E

5000|$|Origen {{seems to}} have been the first ecclesiastical writer to use the word [...] in a nontrinitarian context, but it is evident in his {{writings}} that he considered <b>the</b> <b>Sons</b> divinity lesser than the Fathers, since he even calls <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> a creature. It was by Athanasius of Alexandria and the Nicene Council that <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> <b>was</b> taken to have exactly the same essence with the Father, and in the Nicene Creed <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> <b>was</b> declared to be as immutable as his Father.|$|R
25|$|Orthodox Christians {{believe in}} the Holy Trinity, three distinct, divine persons (hypostases), without overlap or {{modality}} among them, who share one divine essence (ousia Greek οὐσία)—uncreated, immaterial and eternal. These three persons are typically distinguished by their relation to each other. The Father is eternal and not begotten and does not proceed from any, <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> <b>is</b> eternal and begotten of the Father, and the Holy Spirit is eternal and proceeds from the Father. Orthodox doctrine regarding the Holy Trinity is summarized in the Symbol of Faith.|$|E
25|$|Typically, a Bulgarian person {{inherits}} {{the last}} name of his father's family (family name), {{as well as a}} patronymic based on his father's given name, with a gender-agreeing suffix usually added. For example, Stoyan Georgiev Draganov would be the son of Georgi Petkov Draganov. The same person's daughter would bear the names Georgieva Draganova. Another way of preserving the family name and the name of a specific ancestor would be the following circulating of the names: if the father's name is Ivan Petrov Mihailov, <b>the</b> <b>son</b> <b>is</b> named Petar Ivanov Mihailov. Than if Petar has a son, his name will be Ivan Petrov Mihailov, and so on.|$|E
25|$|Major {{themes in}} the novel are reincarnation, the {{immortality}} of the soul, and telepathy. Hamilton Felix {{is the product of}} generations of genetic engineering. He is almost but not quite the perfect human. In {{the second half of the}} book his genetically engineered son is born. <b>The</b> <b>son</b> <b>is</b> the climax of generations of genetic engineering and selective breeding, and is a genetically perfect human. As the son grows he begins to develop almost superhuman mental abilities and a surprising telepathic ability. As the novel draws to a close, it becomes apparent that the son senses that Hamiton Felix's second child, a daughter, is the reincarnation of a wise elderly government official who foresaw her own death and arranged to die shortly before Felix's daughter was born. This official understood that the soul is reincarnated, and in preparation for her own death and reincarnation she was instrumental in the genetic engineering of the son and daughter.|$|E

500|$|The poet W. H. Auden called Kafka [...] "the Dante of {{the twentieth}} century"; the novelist Vladimir Nabokov placed him among the {{greatest}} writers of the 20th century. Gabriel García Márquez noted the reading of Kafka's [...] "The Metamorphosis" [...] showed him [...] "that {{it was possible to}} write in a different way". A prominent theme of Kafka's work, first established in the short story [...] "Das Urteil", is father–son conflict: the guilt induced in <b>the</b> <b>son</b> <b>is</b> resolved through suffering and atonement.

500|$|The [...] "rest" [...] {{that the}} Holy Spirit waits for and finally finds in <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> <b>is</b> {{also found in}} gnostic speculations.

[...] "Rest" [...] is not only to be understood as the ultimate goal of the seeker after truth, which leads to salvation; it is also descriptive of a unity with the wisdom which {{lies at the heart of}} the Godhead.

500|$|The Mahabharata narrates that Vashishtha meets Kalmashapada {{at the end}} of the 12-year {{period and}} frees the king of the curse.

The king requests Vashishtha to inseminate Madayanti, following the practice of niyoga. The queen becomes pregnant by the sage but does not deliver for 12 years. Finally, the frustrated queen breaks her womb with a stone and her son is born. Since <b>the</b> <b>son</b> <b>is</b> born with the aid of a stone (Ashman), he is named Ashmaka ("the child born of a stone").
