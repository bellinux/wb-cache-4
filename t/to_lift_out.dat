25|$|One {{problem that}} arose during the {{conversion}} was a dispute between land-based and maritime unions over conversion jobs. The United States Coast Guard had final say. Queen Mary was deemed a building, {{since most of}} her propellers had been removed and her machinery gutted. The ship was also repainted with its red water level paint at a slightly higher level than previously. During the conversion the funnels were removed, as this area was needed <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>out</b> the scrap materials from the engine and boiler rooms. Workers found that the funnels were significantly degraded and they were replaced with replicas.|$|E
25|$|In both cases, {{having a}} crew member lift {{the end of the}} mast out of the water may help speed the process, as the {{greatest}} challenge of righting a capsized boat is shedding the weight of the water from the sails. A helpful step, where possible (on a loose footed sail), is to disconnect the clew of the sail from the boom, which prevents the sail from scooping up water as the sail lifts out of the water. The bow of the capsized vessel should be pointed towards the wind so that when the sail starts <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>out</b> of the water the wind can catch underneath the sail and help right the boat.|$|E

60|$|They were on {{the shady}} side of a great rock {{overhung}} by a beautiful creeping plant, and with a spring near at hand, and Yusuf, in leisurely fashion, squatted down, caused Arthur <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>out</b> the child, who was fast asleep again, and the mules {{to be allowed to}} feed, and distributed some dried goat's flesh and dates; but Ulysse, somewhat to Arthur's alarm, did not wake sufficiently to partake.|$|E

60|$|At {{last the}} fish became tired, and the fisher drew it {{slowly to the}} bank--a four- or five-pound trout at the very least! Unfortunately the bank was steep, and the boy found, to his distress, that the hook had only caught hold {{slightly}} of the fish's lip. <b>To</b> <b>lift</b> <b>out</b> the heavy creature with the line was therefore impossible, to catch hold of it with the hand was almost equally so; for when he lay down and stretched out his arm as far as possible, he could scarcely touch it {{with the end of}} his finger.|$|E
6000|$|Smash! came a vast {{explosion}} in the forward part of the flagship, and a huge piece of metalwork seemed <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>out</b> of her and dump itself into the sea, dropping men and leaving a gap into which a prompt drachenflieger planted a flaring bomb. And then for an instant Bert perceived only too clearly in the growing, pitiless light a number of minute, convulsively active animalcula scorched and struggling in the Theodore Roosevelt's foaming wake. What were they? Not men--surely not men? Those drowning, mangled little creatures tore with their clutching fingers at Bert's soul. [...] "Oh, Gord!" [...] he cried, [...] "Oh, Gord!" [...] almost whimpering. He looked again and they had gone, and the black stem of the Andrew Jackson, a little disfigured by the sinking Bremen's last shot, was parting the water that had swallowed them into two neatly symmetrical waves. For some moments sheer blank horror blinded Bert to the destruction below.|$|E

60|$|No sooner was {{the bark}} {{on her way}} than the privateersmen set to work <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>out</b> their injured mainmast, and {{to replace it with}} that they had brought on board from the bark. When {{daylight}} broke anxious glances were cast round the horizon; but although a few distant sails were seen, none of these were following a course that would bring them near the brig, and the latter without sail and with her foremast alone standing would not be likely to be noticed. Ralph could not help admiring the energy with which the crew worked. Ordinarily they were by no means a smart crew, and did their work in a slow and slovenly manner; but each man now felt the importance of getting everything into order before an enemy appeared, and so well did they work that by midday the new mast was in its place, and before sunset the topmast with all its yards and gear was up and the sails ready for hoisting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that is not}} so easy. But I may {{say that}} the {{friendly}} ironies began for us {{as soon as we}} were out of the more single-minded keeping of the ship's stewards, who had brought our hand-baggage ashore, and, after extracting the last shilling of tip from us, had delivered us over to the keeping of the customs officers. It began with the joking tone of the inspectors, who surmised that we were not trying to smuggle a great value into the country, and with their apologetic regrets for bothering us to open so many trunks. They implied that it was all a piece of burlesque, which we were bound mutually to carry out for the gratification of a Government which enjoyed that kind of thing. They indulged this whim so far as <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>out</b> the trays, to let the Government see that there was nothing dutiable underneath, where they touched or lifted the contents with a mocking hand, and at times carried the joke so far as to have some of the things removed. But they helped put them back with a smile for the odd taste of the Government. I do not suppose that an exasperating duty was ever so inexasperatingly fulfilled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When the dikes {{enclosing}} {{the lake}} were completed, the engineers set up three very powerful steam engines, and gave {{to each one}} ten or twelve enormous pumps to work. These pumping engines were made on such a grand scale that they lifted over sixty tuns of water at every stroke. But yet so large was the lake, and so vast the quantity of water to be drained, that though {{there were three of}} the engines working at this rate, and though they were kept at work night and day, it took them {{a year and a half}} to lay the ground dry. The work was, however, at last accomplished, and now, what was the bottom of the lake is all converted into pastures and green fields. But they still have to keep the pumps going all the time <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>out</b> the surplus water that falls over the whole space in rain. You may judge that the amount is very large that falls on a district thirty miles round. They calculate that the quantity which they have to pump up now, every year, in order to keep the land from being overflowed again, is over fifty millions of tuns. And that is a quantity larger than you can ever conceive of.|$|E

60|$|The {{night before}} he sailed, Ned, after {{retiring}} to his room {{for the last time}} in his friend's house, locked his door, and went through a variety of little pieces of business that would have surprised his hosts had they seen him. He placed a large strong-box on the table, and cautiously drew from under his bed a carpet-bag, which, from the effort made to lift it, seemed to be filled with some weighty substance. Unlocking the bag, he proceeded <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>out</b> handful after handful of shining dollars and gold pieces, interspersed here and there with massive nuggets. These he transferred into the wooden box until it was full. This was nearly the whole of Ned's fortune. It amounted to a little more than 3000 pounds sterling. Having completed the transfer, Ned counted the surplus left in the bag, and found it to be about 500 pounds. This he secured in a leather purse, and then sat down to write a letter. The letter was short when finished, but it took him long to write, for he meditated much during the writing of it, and several times laid his head on his hands. At last it was completed, put into the box, and the lid screwed down above it. Then Ned read a chapter in the Bible, as was his wont, and retired to rest.|$|E

5000|$|The {{shape and}} weight of the bridge made it {{extremely}} strong at the top, but incredibly weak from underneath. To address concern that flood waters rushing along the river would destroy the bridge in its entirety, the bridge was designed so that the wooden pathway merely [...] "floats" [...] on top of its frame using mortise and tenon joints.

5000|$|Culture {{guides the}} act of {{recognizing}} a feeling by proposing what's {{possible for us to}} feel. In The Managed Heart Hochschild cites the Czech novelist Milan Kundera, who writes that the Czech word [...] "litost" [...] refers to an indefinable longing, mixed with remorse and grief—a constellation of feelings with no equivalent in any other language. It is not that non-Czechs never feel litost, she notes; it is that they are not, in the same way, invited <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>out</b> and affirm the feeling—instead of to disregard or suppress it.|$|E
