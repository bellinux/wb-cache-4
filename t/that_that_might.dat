2500|$|There {{has been}} a mill at Bacton Wood since the Domesday Book was {{produced}} in 1086. The present building was reconstructed in 1747, and extensively modified in 1825, {{in anticipation of the}} canal opening, and the increase in trade <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> bring. It was made of white rendered brick, with a roof of slates, although the adjoining mill house had a pantiled roof, but was subsequently reroofed in slate. The cast iron waterwheel was [...] in diameter and [...] wide, providing enough power to turn three sets of stones. The water supply was not always adequate in the summer, and a Dodman steam plant was installed in the late nineteenth century. Its boiler exploded around 1910, and an [...] hot bulb engine manufactured by Richard Hornsby & Sons replaced it. The mill was last used commercially in 1944, by which time it was powered by a diesel engine. It was sold for conversion to a house in 1967. The Hornsby engine was sold to enthusiasts when the mill was restored in 1984, and the mill was bought by Laurence Ashton in 1994, who is hoping to run it using water power once his Old Canal Company has rewatered the canal. There are four sets of stones on the milling floor. Sir William Cubitt, who invented the self-regulating windmill sail in 1807 and the prison treadmill in 1818, lived in the mill house during his childhood.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hasn't it {{occurred}} to you <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> have been political strategy?" [...] Tallente suggested. [...] "They might have maneuvered for the very situation which has arisen--that is, if I am really worth anything to anybody." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Her own {{way into}} the bargain," [...] said Ned. Whereupon Tom Spooner winked, and {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> be as things turned out after the marriage. He was quite willing to run his chance for that.|$|E
60|$|Lady Staveley {{had known}} it, but up to <b>that</b> moment {{she had hoped}} <b>that</b> <b>that</b> {{knowledge}} <b>might</b> have remained hidden {{as though it were}} unknown.|$|R
60|$|Montmorency {{does not}} lack pluck; {{but there was}} {{something}} about the look of <b>that</b> cat <b>that</b> <b>might</b> have chilled the heart of the boldest dog. He stopped abruptly, and looked back at Tom.|$|R
60|$|Oh! <b>that</b> blessed hailstorm <b>that</b> {{drove us}} in! I drew Harold into a seat by the door, keeping {{between him and}} <b>that,</b> <b>that</b> he <b>might</b> not escape. But I need not have feared.|$|R
6000|$|Montague had {{intended}} to tell all,--almost all. There was a something about the journey to Lowestoft which {{it would be impossible}} to make Hetta understand, and he thought <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> be omitted. 'It was on account of her health.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will I be traitor to my knight, dost think? That were dishonor. I may {{not part}} from thee until in knightly {{encounter}} in the field some overmatching champion shall fairly win and fairly wear me. I were to blame an I thought <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> ever hap." ...|$|E
60|$|The most {{astonishing}} subscription was {{one from}} Aunt Matilda herself. One day she handed to Kate a ten-cent piece--silver, old style--and desired <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> {{be put into}} the company for her. Where she got it, nobody knew, but she had it, and she put it in.|$|E
50|$|The White House {{originally}} {{released a}} statement opposing the bill, but changed its mind and supported the bill. Speaker of the House John Boehner indicated <b>that</b> <b>that</b> House <b>might</b> consider the Senate bill.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Goffe remarked <b>that</b> all <b>that</b> <b>might</b> be very well, but <b>that,</b> as {{so large}} a {{property}} was at stake, {{the friends of}} the lady, according to all usage, were bound to interfere. A settlement had already been made in regard to the Earl.|$|R
25|$|The draft {{statement}} further asserts <b>that</b> any clones <b>that</b> <b>might</b> be created should have full acceptance {{as human beings}} and access to rites of the church.|$|R
6000|$|... 3. Here also is {{a design}} of Satan set on foot; for these carnal gospellers are his tares, the {{children}} of the wicked one; those that he hath sowed among the wheat of purpose, if possible, <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> be rooted up by beholding and learning to be vile and filthy of them. (Matt. 13:36-43) ...|$|E
60|$|As for the {{statement}} {{relating to the}} destruction of the will, the prisoner had formerly practiced at the Bar, and was perfectly well aware that the will made in his favour a year before was automatically revoked by his stepmother's remarriage. He would call evidence to show who did destroy the will, and it was possible <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> open up quite a new view of the case.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew her}} {{when she was a little}} child and used to climb about my knees; I love her as I love my own, and now--oh, poor thing, poor thing, I cannot bear it!--she's gone and lost her heart to this mangy materializee! Why didn't we see <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> happen? But how could we? Nobody could; nobody could ever have dreamed of such a thing. You couldn't expect a person would fall in love with a wax-work. And this one doesn't even amount to that." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{search of}} the body {{revealed}} two pieces of circumstancial evidence <b>that</b> suggested <b>that</b> Mallory <b>might</b> have reached the summit: ...|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the song}} was performed, Phil Collins would talk to the {{audience}} about the Domino Principle and demonstrate it by stating <b>that</b> something <b>that</b> <b>might</b> happen {{to the people in}} one section, might affect the people in another section (with the lights lighting up <b>that</b> section of the audience) multiple times.|$|R
60|$|He put it <b>that</b> way <b>that</b> she <b>might</b> {{not think}} he had yielded to an impulse of which his head would disapprove.|$|R
60|$|Both Jack and {{the others}} {{would have been more}} {{concerned}} had they known the truth, which was that Ruth had already been placed in the care of an eye specialist and been removed to that physician's private sanitarium. Pressed to tell the exact truth by Mr. Stevenson, the specialist had admitted that Ruth's eyes had suffered exceedingly, and that she was in danger of losing the sight of one of them and <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> possibly affect the other. As Mrs. Stevenson was very nervous already, the doctor had advised her husband to keep the truth to himself for the present and hope for the best.|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] he said, with a shake in his voice, [...] "is {{something}} very special. China figure, said to {{date back to}} the Ming Dynasty. Unique. Nothing like it {{on either side of the}} Atlantic. If I were selling this at Christie's in London, where people," [...] he said, nastily, [...] "have an educated appreciation of the beautiful, the rare, and the exquisite, I should start the bidding at a thousand dollars. This afternoon's experience has taught me <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> possibly be too high." [...] His pince-nez sparkled militantly, as he gazed upon the stolid throng. [...] "Will anyone offer me a dollar for this unique figure?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you {{are only}} a man, and you need not be amazed," [...] said his sister. [...] "This is the way I have been {{thinking}} of it: if you ever do want to get married, I hope you will not marry Dora Bannister. I used sometimes to think <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> {{be a good thing}} to do, though I changed my mind very often about it, but I do not think so, now, at all. Dora is an awfully nice girl in ever so many ways, but since I have been at Barport with her, I am positive that I do not want you to marry her." ...|$|E
25|$|Bretha Cr√≥lige {{also goes}} into the {{importance}} of keeping a proper environment for the victim during his sick-maintenances. Largely this means <b>that</b> anything <b>that</b> <b>might</b> cause loud noise was prohibited in the vicinity. This included fights by men {{as well as by}} dogs, the playing of games and even the disciplining of children.|$|R
50|$|In May, {{one of the}} Kitchener {{committee}} members {{got in touch with}} a real estate agent. Many properties were available including the land where African Safari (a well known open air zoo in Ontario) is now located. A message arrived a few days later <b>that</b> something <b>that</b> <b>might</b> be suitable was for sale.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes. But {{he first}} {{asked me what}} I was. He was an oldish man, and I met him just as I {{was coming out of}} the bath-house. He had a basket of clams on his arm, and I asked him where he caught them. That made him laugh, and he said he dug them out of the sand under the wharf. Then he asked me if my name was Cisneros, and when I told him it was not, he said that I looked like a Spaniard, and he thought <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> be my name. And so, as he had asked me about myself, I asked him if he was a Minorcan, and he said 'yes.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{to account}} for the {{likeness}} between Andrews, an American adventurer, and Jones, reared and educated in the mysterious island of Sangoa. Ajo's father must have left some near relatives in this country when he became a recluse in his far-away island. Why did he become a recluse? That's a subject I must consider carefully, for {{he was a man of}} money, a man of science, a man of affairs. Jones has told us he has no relatives here. He may have spoken honestly, if his father kept him in ignorance of the family history. I'm not going to jump at the conclusion that the man who calls himself Jack Andrews is a near relative of our Ajo--a cousin, perhaps--but I'll not forget <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> explain the likeness between them.|$|E
6000|$|AND TO KNOW THE LOVE OF CHRIST WHICH PASSETH KNOWLEDGE. These {{words are}} {{the second part}} of the text, and they deal mainly about the love of Christ, who is the Son of God. We have spoken already briefly of God, and {{therefore}} now we shall speak also of his Son. These words are a part of the prayer afore-mentioned, and have something of the same strain in them. In the first part, he prays that they might comprehend that which cannot absolutely by any means be comprehended: and here he prays <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> be known, which yet in the same breath he saith, passeth knowledge, to wit, the love of Christ. And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge. In the words we are to take notice of three things: ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Woodward, {{trying to}} smile through her tears, could only say <b>that</b> she would pray <b>that</b> <b>that</b> time <b>might</b> soon come; and so, bidding God bless him, {{as a mother}} might bless her child, she left him and {{returned}} to Hampton, not with a light heart.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Tryan {{might well}} rejoice when his eye rested {{on her as}} he entered his desk; but he rejoiced with trembling. He could {{not look at the}} sweet hopeful face without remembering its yesterday's look of agony; and there was the {{possibility}} <b>that</b> <b>that</b> look <b>might</b> return.|$|R
6000|$|... "They often {{discussed}} the price I would bring, and <b>that</b> <b>that</b> price <b>might</b> not lessen, they guarded me jealously {{from one another}} so the journeys were made as little fatiguing for me as possible. I was given the best food at their command and I was not harmed.|$|R
6000|$|The Serjeant {{told his}} wife the promise which he had made on her behalf, and she, of course, {{undertook}} to go to Keppel Street on the following morning. [...] "You had better bring her here," [...] said the Serjeant. Mrs. Bluestone remarked <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> be sooner said than done. [...] "She'll be glad of an excuse to come," [...] answered the Serjeant. [...] "On such an occasion as this, of course they must see each other. Something must be arranged about the property. In a month or two, when she is of age, she will have the undisputed right {{to do what she}} pleases with about three hundred thousand pounds. It is a most remarkable position for a young girl who has never yet had the command of a penny, and who professes that she is engaged to marry a working tailor. Of course her mother must see her." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{there must}} be some nous in your advertisements; {{there must be}} a system, and {{there must be some}} wit in your system. It won't suffice now-a-days to stick up on a blank wall a simple placard to say that you have forty {{thousand}} best hose just new arrived. Any wooden-headed fellow can do as much as <b>that.</b> <b>That</b> <b>might</b> have served in the olden times that we hear of, twenty years since; but the game to be successful in these days must be played in another sort of fashion. There must be some finish about your advertisements, something new in your style, something that will startle in your manner. If a man can make himself a real master of this art, we may say that he has learnt his trade, whatever that trade may be. Let him know how to advertise, and the rest will follow.|$|E
60|$|When {{the giant}} had thus far {{proceeded}} in his work, {{in the next}} place, he betook him to build some strongholds in the town, and he built three {{that seemed to be}} impregnable. The first he called the Hold of Defiance, because it was made to command the whole town, and to keep it from the knowledge of its ancient King. The second he called Midnight Hold, because it was built on purpose to keep Mansoul from the true knowledge of itself. The third was called Sweet-Sin Hold, because by that he fortified Mansoul against all desires of good. The first of these holds stood close by Eye-gate, that, as much might be, light might be darkened there; the second was built hard by the old castle, to the end <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> be made more blind, if possible; and the third stood in the market- place.|$|E
6000|$|Therefore, as capital increases, more labor can be employed. When [...] the Pittsburg rioters, in 1877, {{destroyed}} property, or {{the product}} [...] of past labor, {{they did not}} realize then <b>that</b> <b>that</b> property <b>might,</b> [...] but now could never again, be employed for productive purposes, [...] and thereby support laborers.|$|R

5000|$|There is a {{difference}} between the concepts of [...] "inequality" [...] and [...] "inequity." [...] An inequality implies there is some comparison being made. For example, if a boss doesn't listen attentively to an employee, <b>that</b> in and of itself is not a micro-inequality. However, if the boss listens attentively to all of an employee's coworkers but not <b>that</b> employee, <b>that</b> <b>might</b> be a micro-inequality.|$|R
