5|$|During the Han Dynasty, silk became {{progressively}} more valuable {{in its own}} right, and became more than simply a material.

The wealth that silk brought to China stirred envy in neighboring peoples. Beginning in the 2nd century BCE, the Xiongnu regularly pillaged the provinces of the Han Chinese for around 250 years. Silk was a common offering by the emperor to these tribes in exchange for peace.|$|E

Many of these preparations were similar to those which had been made {{on the occasion of the}} king's coronation. There was a castle and tower, with young girls at the top throwing down a shower of golden snow, and fountains at the sides flowing with wine, with fancifully-dressed pages attending to offer the princess drink from golden cups.

Gamezebo reviewer instead faulted the series and wrote that after three games, its formula felt repetitive. TouchArcade concluded that, unlike the other Go games, Deus Ex Go was less creative overall and did not subvert the themes of its parent series quite like the others.|$|E
5|$|Though it is {{the least}} {{reactive}} of the halogens, iodine {{is still one of}} the more reactive elements. For example, while chlorine gas will halogenate carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, and sulfur dioxide to phosgene, nitrosyl chloride, and sulfuryl chloride respectively, iodine will not do so. Furthermore, iodination of metals tends to result in lower oxidation states than chlorination or bromination; for example, rhenium metal reacts with chlorine to form rhenium hexachloride, but with bromine it forms only rhenium pentabromide and iodine can achieve only rhenium tetraiodide. By <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>token,</b> however, since iodine has the lowest ionisation energy among the halogens and is the most easily oxidised of them, it has a more significant cationic chemistry and its higher oxidation states are rather more stable than those of bromine and chlorine, for example in iodine heptafluoride.|$|E

5|$|Theophrastus {{was barely}} known to western Europe in the Middle Ages; his {{writings}} were popularized there {{only in the}} 15th century, when Greek manuscripts in the Vatican, possibly, like many other ancient Vatican Greek manuscripts, brought from the Byzantine Empire during its fall to the Ottomans in the 15th century, were translated into Latin by the Byzantine Greek refugee Theodorus Gaza {{at the request of}} pope Nicholas V. The effect was to stimulate Renaissance scholars to restart the exploration of plant taxonomy. The science of botany was founded as these scholars engaged with the accounts of plants, and especially of their medicinal uses, together with a newly critical reaction to mediaeval pharmacology, which was based on unthinking acceptance of the Natural History of Pliny the Elder and the De Materia Medica of Dioscorides. By <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>token,</b> however, Theophrastus (and Aristotle) fell abruptly out of use around 1550, as classical botany and zoology were effectively assimilated into Renaissance thought in the form of illustrated encyclopedias—which were still heavily based on classical writings.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen may be usefully {{compared}} to its horizontal neighbours carbon and oxygen {{as well as}} its vertical neighbours in the pnictogen column (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth). Although each period 2 element from lithium to nitrogen shows some similarities to the period 3 element in the next group from magnesium to sulfur (known as the diagonal relationships), their degree drops off quite abruptly past the boron–silicon pair, so that the similarities of nitrogen to sulfur are mostly limited to sulfur nitride ring compounds when both elements are the only ones present. Nitrogen resembles oxygen far more than it does carbon with its high electronegativity and concomitant capability for hydrogen bonding and the ability to form coordination complexes by donating its lone pairs of electrons. It does not share carbon's proclivity for catenation, with the longest chain of nitrogen yet discovered being composed of only eight nitrogen atoms (PhN=N–N(Ph)–N=N–N(Ph)–N=NPh). One property nitrogen does share with both its horizontal neighbours is its preferentially forming multiple bonds, typically with carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen atoms, through pπ–pπ interactions; thus, for example, nitrogen occurs as diatomic molecules and thus has very much lower melting (−210°C) and boiling points (−196°C) than the rest of its group, as the N2 molecules are only held together by weak van der Waals interactions and there are very few electrons available to create significant instantaneous dipoles. This is not possible for its vertical neighbours; thus, the nitrogen oxides, nitrites, nitrates, nitro-, nitroso-, azo-, and diazo-compounds, azides, cyanates, thiocyanates, and imino-derivatives find no echo with phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth. By <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>token,</b> however, the complexity of the phosphorus oxoacids finds no echo with nitrogen.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about brain {{mechanisms}} recruited during the monitoring and appraisal of social conflicts-for instance, when individuals {{compete with each other}} for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> resources. We designed a novel experimental task inducing resource conflicts between two individuals. In an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design, participants played with another human participant or against a computer, who across trials chose either different (no-conflict) or <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>tokens</b> (conflict trials) in order to obtain monetary gains. In conflict trials, the participants could decide whether they would share the token, and the resulting gain, with the other person or instead keep all points for themselves. Behaviorally, participants shared much more often when playing with a human partner than with a computer. fMRI results demonstrated that the dorsal mediofrontal cortex was selectively activated during human conflicts. This region might {{play a key role in}} detecting situations in which self- and social interest are incompatible and require behavioral adjustment. In addition, we found a conflict-related response in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex that correlated with measures of social relationship and individual sharing behavior. Taken together, these findings reveal a key role of these prefrontal areas for the appraisal and resolution of interpersonal resource conflicts...|$|R
40|$|The "delayed hypersensitive" {{reactivity}} {{induced by}} antigen-antibody complexes {{has been studied}} from the standpoints {{of the role of}} such complexes in establishing this state, and the relationship of this state to classical delayed hypersensitivity. It has been shown that the reactivity established by antigen-antibody complexes appears early after injection, disappears within a few days, and is characterized by several properties which make it appear similar to true delayed hypersensitivity, including its appearance, its relative persistence for 48 hours, and its occurrence in the absence of antibodies. By <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>tokens,</b> it may be distinguished from hypersensitive reactions of the immediate type. It is referred to here as reactivity of the Jones-Mote type. Antigen alone stimulates exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> kind of early reactive state, but with larger doses of antigen this is later replaced by other immunologic responses including circulating antibodies and Arthus reactivity. If sufficiently small doses of antigen are employed, however, the "monophasic" reaction which follows antigen-antibody complexes consisting of the Jones-Mote type of skin responsiveness may be seen. The dermal reactivity under discussion is unlike classical delayed hypersensitivity chiefly in its evanescent character; it is present only during a few days early after antigen administration. It is suggested that this kind of reactivity, which may perhaps require a category of its own, {{may be related to the}} "tissue immunity" to tumor transplants which has been observed in mice...|$|R

There had not been a more delicious afternoon than this in all the train of summer, the air being a sunny perfume, made up of balm and warmth, and gentle brightness. The oak and walnut trees over my head retained their deep masses of foliage, and the grass, though for months the pasturage of stray cattle, had been revived with the freshness of early June by the autumnal rains of the preceding week. The garb of autumn, indeed, resembled that of spring. Dandelions and butterflies were sprinkled along the roadside like drops of brightest gold in greenest grass, and a star-shaped little flower of blue, with a golden centre. In a rocky spot, and rooted under the stone walk, there was one wild rose-bush bearing three roses very faintly tinted, but blessed with a spicy fragrance. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>tokens</b> would have announced that the year was brightening into the glow of summer.

40|$|Research on {{the second}} {{language}} acquisition (SLA) of Spanish has identified grammatical structures for which an analysis of errors for second-language (L 2) learners is inappropriate (Geeslin, 2003; Geeslin & Guijarro-Fuentes, 2006; Gudmestad, 2006). This is because the norms of use for such structures are changing, and prescriptive grammars do not coincide with actual language use. Thus, {{in order to examine}} such sociolinguistically-variable grammatical features in learner language, researchers have shifted to an analysis of the predictors of use of a given variant, rather than an assessment of accuracy (Geeslin, 2000). Investigations following this approach on structures such as copula choice and mood choice have been largely based on written contextualized tasks (WCT), where use is contextualized and participants indicate a preference for one of the two possible variants. The advantage of this type of task is twofold. First, in comparison with grammaticality judgment tasks, participants are not forced to select one (presumably the only) grammatical sentence from the options provided. Consequently, the WCT is more in line with the idea that variation is indeed an acceptable, and even irrefutable, part of native-like speech. Secondly, in comparison with tasks that elicit less directed production, the WCT assures that each participant will respond to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>tokens</b> (both lexically {{and in terms of the}} contextual features that predict selection of a given variant) and that eac...|$|R

40|$|The present {{high-density}} ERP {{study on}} 13 adults aimed {{to determine whether}} number conservation relies {{on the ability to}} inhibit the overlearned length-equals-number strategy and then imagine the shortening of the row that was lengthened. Participants performed the number-conservation task and, after the EEG session, the mental imagery task. In the number-conservation task, first two rows with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> number of <b>tokens</b> and <b>the</b> <b>same</b> length were presented on a computer screen (COV condition) and then, the tokens in one of the two rows were spread apart (INT condition). Participants were instructed to determine whether the two rows had an identical number of tokens. In the mental imagery task, two rows with different lengths but <b>the</b> <b>same</b> number of <b>tokens</b> were presented and participants were instructed to imagine the tokens in the longer row aligning with the tokens in the shorter row. In the number-conservation task, we found that the amplitudes of the centro-parietal N 2 and fronto-central P 3 were higher in the INT than in the COV conditions. In addition, the differences in response times between the two conditions were correlated with the differences in the amplitudes of the fronto-central P 3. In light of previous results reported on the number-conservation task in adults, the present results suggest that inhibition might be necessary to succeed the number-conservation task in adults even when the transformation of the length of one of the row is displayed. Finally, we also reported correlations between the speed at which participants could imagine the shortening of one of the row in the mental imagery task, the speed at which participants could determine that the two rows had <b>the</b> <b>same</b> number of <b>tokens</b> after the tokens in one of the row were spread apart and the latency of the late positive parietal component in the number-conservation task.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Davidson’s {{anomalous}} monism, {{his argument}} for the identity between mental and physical event tokens, has been frequently attacked, usually demanding {{a higher degree of}} physicalist commitment. My objection runs in the opposite direction: the identities inferred by Davidson from mental causation, the nomological character of causality and the anomaly of the mental are philosophically problematic and, more dramatically, incompatible with his famous argument against the third dogma of empiricism, the separation of content from conceptual scheme. Given the anomaly of the mental and the absence of psychophysical laws, there are no conceptual resources to relate mental and physical predicates. We fall in the third dogma if we claim that <b>the</b> very <b>same</b> <b>token</b> event is mental and physical. One of the premises must be rejected: I will claim that we do not need a law to subsume cause and effect to be entitled to speak of causation. Davidson has never offered an argument to back this premise. Against such a dogma I will sketch some ideas pointing towards a different conception of causality, singularist and undetachable from explanatory practices. 1...|$|R

Linear logic has pointed out the fact that resources had to be handled with a restricted set of logical rules and that they could not easily be handled concurrently with classical logic propositions.
