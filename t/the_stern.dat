5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{attempts}} to dismantle or tow <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> to sea failed, the State of Oregon still intended {{to see the}} remainder of the vessel removed from the beach. In 2006, the state's lawsuit against the ship's owners was settled, clearing the legal obstacles that prevented removal and providing the funds necessary to finance the project. Removal plans were {{complicated by the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> had become deeply embedded in the sand in the seven years since the wreck, with some portions of <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> estimated to be 2030feet (69m) below the sand line.|$|E

50|$|On March 27, 1986, Mary Beth {{gave birth}} to a daughter, who she named Sara Elizabeth Whitehead. 3 days later, Mary Beth handed the baby over to Betsy and Bill, who renamed her Melissa Elizabeth Stern. However, within 24 hours of {{transferring}} physical custody to <b>the</b> <b>Sterns,</b> Mary Beth went to them and demanded that the baby be given back to her, allegedly threatening suicide. Mary Beth subsequently refused to return baby Melissa to <b>the</b> <b>Sterns</b> and left New Jersey, taking the infant with her. <b>The</b> <b>Sterns</b> had <b>the</b> Whitehead family's bank accounts frozen and sought warrants for their arrest.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stern</b> section {{remained}} aground, but did {{not pose}} a significant oil spill threat as {{the majority of the}} oil on board had already leaked or burned. Some remaining oil that was found on board was skimmed or pumped out manually. In June 1999, Green Atlas awarded a ship breaking contract to Donjon Marine Co. and Fred Devine Diving and Salvage. Although the two companies were able to remove approximately one-third of <b>the</b> <b>stern,</b> their attempts to dismantle the largest section or tow it to sea were unsuccessful and had to be abandoned over the winter. However, work did not resume in the spring of 2000, and in 2001, a salvage expert hired by Green Atlas claimed <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> should not be removed because it would create a dangerous work environment. The state later accused Green Atlas of sabotaging <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> removal effort in order to save money; a protracted legal battle ensued.|$|E

Jack dies of hypothermia but Rose is saved.|$|E
5|$|Astrid had two deckhouses: one at <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> with navigational {{equipment}} and maps, and another forward containing a bar. The lower deck had twelve 2-person cabins (of which three {{could be used}} as 3-person cabins) as well as showers, toilets and a galley.|$|E

2500|$|In 1817 the British naval {{architect}} Sir Robert Seppings first introduced {{the concept of}} the round or circular <b>stern.</b> <b>The</b> square <b>stern</b> had been an easy target for enemy cannon, and could not support the weight of heavy stern chase guns. But Seppings' design left the rudder head exposed, and was regarded by many as simply ugly—no American warships were designed with such <b>sterns,</b> and <b>the</b> round <b>stern</b> was quickly superseded by <b>the</b> elliptical <b>stern.</b> <b>The</b> United States began building <b>the</b> first elliptical <b>stern</b> warship in 1820, a decade before the British. [...] became the first sailing ship to sport such a stern. Though a great improvement over <b>the</b> transom <b>stern</b> in terms of its vulnerability to attack when under fire, elliptical sterns still had obvious weaknesses which <b>the</b> next major <b>stern</b> development—the iron-hulled cruiser stern—addressed far better and with much different materials.|$|R
5|$|Blackwood rapidly gained on {{the ship}} {{of the line and}} by 00:30 the frigate was within range, pulling up under <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> of Guillaume Tell and {{beginning}} a steady fire to which Decrés could only respond with his stern-chasers, light cannon situated in <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> of the ship. Decrés recognised that if he stopped to engage Penelope then the rest of Berry's squadron, visible on the horizon to the south, would soon overwhelm him. He therefore continued sailing to the northeast, hoping his heavy ship of the line could outrun the light and speedy frigate. However, Penelope was too fast, and Blackwood handled his ship with considerable skill, managing to pass Decrés' stern repeatedly and pour several raking broadsides into the French ship.|$|E

5|$|The Admiralty ordered Captain Warburton-Lee {{to attack}} German {{shipping}} in Narvik, Norway on 9 April. The following morning Hardy led four of her half-sisters down Ofotfjord in a surprise dawn attack on Narvik harbour during a blinding snowstorm. A torpedo from Hardy blew off <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> of the German flagship, , {{and killed the}} German flotilla commander, Commodore Friedrich Bonte. Heidkamp sank the next day. Another hit a merchant ship in <b>the</b> <b>stern.</b> A second salvo of four torpedoes was fired at two other German destroyers, but missed and badly damaged the ore docks. After regrouping, Captain Warburton-Lee led another attack on the harbour later that morning, but inflicted little additional damage due to poor visibility.|$|E

Many buildings on Mamilla's eastern end were in shambles from the fighting and lack of maintenance. Several historic buildings were condemned. One was <b>the</b> <b>Stern</b> House, which housed Zionist leader Theodor Herzl on his 1898 visit. However, popular outcry brought Supreme Court involvement {{which led to the}} temporary dismantling and reassembly nearby of this historical landmark.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} October 1943, Howe and King George V had {{returned}} to Britain. At the end of year, Howe underwent a long overhaul at Devonport, where a number of alterations were made.

Modifications were accomplished in the officers and crew quarters for operations in tropical climates; these included changes in insulation, and the extensive use of air-conditioning equipment.|$|E
