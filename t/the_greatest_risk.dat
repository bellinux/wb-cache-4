5|$|FreeFall Stage {{discouraged}} {{people under the}} age of fifteen from attending because of {{the subject matter of the}} play, but encouraged older teenagers to attend because teenagers are at <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> of being trafficked. Several human trafficking survivors attended the performances, and other survivors sent the Eldridges messages about their personal experiences with human trafficking. Quandt said that he encountered many audience members who, because of watching the play, became determined to do something to combat human trafficking.|$|E
5|$|Gedi {{was made}} a {{historic}} monument in 1927. The site was declared a protected monument in 1929, after looters began removing Chinese porcelain inset as architectural decoration. In 1939, the Kenya Public Works Department began restoring structures that were at <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> of collapse. Further site restoration, primarily clearing vegetation overgrowth, was conducted in 1948–1959 by James Kirkman, who was appointed warden of the site after Gedi and the surrounding forest was declared a national park in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Hurricanes are an ever-present threat {{during the}} summer and fall season, which puts Galveston in Coastal Windstorm Area. Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula are {{generally}} at <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> among the communities near the Galveston Bay. However, though the island and peninsula provide some shielding, the bay shoreline still faces significant danger from storm surge.|$|E

5|$|The blast {{caused by}} a sudden release of the gas {{pressure}} inside a diving cylinder makes them very dangerous if mismanaged. <b>The</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> of explosion exists while filling, but cylinders have also been known to burst when overheated. The cause of failure can range from reduced wall thickness or deep pitting due to internal corrosion, neck thread failure due to incompatible valve threads, or cracking due to fatigue, sustained high stresses, or overheating effects in aluminum.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> in flying is in takeoff and landing, {{meaning that}} longer {{aircraft}} trips are safer per mile. Commuter planes used on shorter flights have higher risk than larger jet aircraft. Driving on U.S. Interstate highways, which {{are almost always}} controlled-access divided highways, is safer than driving on most other roads and highways.|$|E
5|$|In general, avian {{influenza}} {{is a disease}} of birds caused by bird-specific influenza A virus that is not normally transferred to people; however, people in contact with live poultry are at <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> of becoming infected with the virus and this is of particular concern {{in areas such as}} Southeast Asia, where the disease is endemic in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can become infected. The virus possibly could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an influenza pandemic.|$|E

5|$|Radioisotopes of caesium {{require special}} precautions: the {{improper}} handling of caesium-137 gamma ray sources {{can lead to}} release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries. Perhaps the best-known case is the Goiânia accident of 1987, in which an improperly-disposed-of radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic {{in the city of}} Goiânia, Brazil, was scavenged from a junkyard, and the glowing caesium salt sold to curious, uneducated buyers. This led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure. Together with caesium-134, iodine-131, and strontium-90, caesium-137 was among the isotopes distributed by the Chernobyl disaster which constitute <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> to health. Radioisotopes of francium would presumably be dangerous as well due to their high decay energy and short half-life, but none have been produced in large enough amounts to pose any serious risk.|$|E
5|$|Heat {{waves are}} a common feature of summers in the city. These heat waves place extra demand on {{electricity}} usage, leading to shortages. In extreme cases, these power shortages during heat waves can cause traffic jams and protests, such as the December 2013 heat wave (longest heat wave ever recorded in Buenos Aires) where increased energy demand lead to energy shortages and power cuts, protests against the government over the lack of service, and traffic jams {{as a result of}} these protests. However, most heat waves are of short duration (usually less than a week), and are followed by the passage of the cold, dry Pampero wind, which brings violent and intense thunderstorms with strong gusts and hail followed by cooler temperatures and lower humidity. Occasionally, a tornado can form, which can strike the city although most tornadoes are relatively weak and rarely cause deaths. <b>The</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> for tornadoes occurs in the summer season due to the favourable conditions. These severe storms can damage cars, houses and disrupt public services such as transportation and collection and disposal of urban solid waste.|$|E

25|$|Childhood obesity can {{be brought}} on by a range of factors which often act in combination. “Obesogenic environment” is the medical term set aside for this mixture of elements. <b>The</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> factor for child obesity is the obesity of both parents.

Almost 30% said that they were concerned with their child's weight. 35% of parents thought that their child's school was not teaching them enough about childhood obesity, and over 5% thought that childhood obesity was <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> to their child's long term health.|$|E
