5|$|Alboin's {{decision}} {{to create a}} duchy and designate a duke were both important innovations; until then, the Lombards had never had dukes or duchies based on a walled town. The innovation adopted was part of Alboin's borrowing of Roman and Ostrogothic administrative models, as in Late Antiquity the comes civitatis (city count) was the main local authority, with full administrative powers in his region. But the shift from count (comes) to duke (dux) and from county (comitatus) to duchy (ducatus) also signalled the progressive militarization of Italy. The selection of a fortified town as the centre for the new duchy was also an important change from the time in Pannonia, for while urbanized settlements had previously been ignored by the Lombards, now a considerable part of the nobility settled itself in Forum Iulii, a pattern that was repeated regularly by the Lombards in <b>their</b> <b>other</b> duchies.|$|E

Although the Jets drew just over 100,000 fans to the Polo Grounds in seven home games, they quickly sold 17,500season tickets for the first season in Shea Stadium. Running back Matt Snell was drafted by both New York teams, and the Jets were able to sign him.|$|E
