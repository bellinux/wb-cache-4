25|$|Eton Society: {{commonly}} known as Pop. Over the years its power and privileges have grown. Pop is the oldest self-electing society at Eton. The rules were altered in 1987 and again in 2005 so that the new intake are not elected solely by the existing year and a committee of masters. Members of Pop are entitled to wear checked spongebag trousers, and a waistcoat designed as they wish. Historically, only members of Pop were entitled <b>to</b> <b>furl</b> their umbrellas or sit on the wall on the Long Walk, {{in front of the}} main building. However, this tradition has died out. They perform roles at many of the routine events of the school year, including School Plays, parents' evenings and other official events. Notable ex-members of Pop include Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, Eddie Redmayne and Boris Johnson.|$|E
2500|$|That evening a {{snowstorm}} began {{and the ship}} anchored in 18 fathoms of water. [...] Due to the weather conditions {{it was not possible}} <b>to</b> <b>furl</b> all the sails. [...] On 3 January a violent gale began to blow from east of northeast. [...] The crew cut the anchor cable so the ship could run out to sea. At noon that day they met a brig, who took the pilot, then continued westward down the channel. In the evening the wind increased in strength, now coming from the south.|$|E
60|$|The most {{terrific job}} {{of all was}} <b>to</b> <b>furl</b> the main-sail, which, at the {{commencement}} of the squalls, had been clewed up, coaxed and quieted {{as much as possible}} with the bunt-lines and slab-lines. Mad Jack waited some time for a lull, ere he gave an order so perilous to be executed. For <b>to</b> <b>furl</b> this enormous sail, in such a gale, required at least fifty men on the yard; whose weight, superadded to that of the ponderous stick itself, still further jeopardised their lives. But there was no prospect of a cessation of the gale, and the order was at last given.|$|E
60|$|After losing {{sight of}} the Morea the weather changed, clouds banked up rapidly in the southwest, and the captain ordered the great sails <b>to</b> be <b>furled.</b>|$|R
50|$|Supporting - Halyards raise sails {{and control}} luff tension. Topping lifts hold booms and yards aloft. On a gaff sail, brails {{run from the}} leech to the spar <b>to</b> {{facilitate}} <b>furling.</b>|$|R
50|$|The sail {{must also}} have a fairly {{straight}} edge to lie along the furling roller, and be flat enough to form a neat, compact roll. If the sail meets these conditions, then it may be suitable for use with a roller furling system; if the sail is not, then {{it may be possible}} to replace the sail with one of a design more conducive <b>to</b> <b>furling.</b> Jibs and genoas, for example, are generally suitable for furling, as they are relatively flat, while a gennaker, with its larger degree of camber, is probably not suitable for furling.|$|R
60|$|I {{never found}} out what was the dodge that Tom, in his wisdom, was to have put me up to, for {{at that moment the}} captain came on deck, and gave orders <b>to</b> <b>furl</b> the top-gallant sails.|$|E
60|$|Every eye on deck {{was fixed}} on the four seamen as, rapidly but steadily, they {{proceeded}} <b>to</b> <b>furl</b> and stow the sail. There was still not a breath of wind, but a low humming noise was heard.|$|E
60|$|She moved away, and Grahame, calling {{one of the}} men <b>to</b> <b>furl</b> the awning, {{went into}} the {{deckhouse}} and deliberately pored over a chart. There were times when it was not safe to permit himself to think of Evelyn.|$|E
6000|$|It {{seemed that}} I {{and the morning}} world [...] Were pressed cup-shape to take this reiver [...] Bird who was weary <b>to</b> have <b>furled</b> [...] Her wings in us, [...] As we were weary to receive her.|$|R
2500|$|This {{photograph}} shows {{well the}} auxiliary sail rig of the Anderson. [...] There appear <b>to</b> be <b>furled</b> sails on the forestay and foremast. [...] The image also shows the later version of Anderson when her passenger deck had been extended {{all the way}} to her bow.|$|R
50|$|The buntlines {{are small}} lines {{fastened}} {{to the bottom of}} the sails, in the middle part of the bolt rope, to the cringle; and so are passed through a small block, seized to the yard. Their use is to trice up the bunt of the sail, <b>to</b> better <b>furl</b> it up.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Because of the gold--because of our gold. Gold changes men altogether. Thorkild of Borkum did not change. He {{laughed at}} Witta for his fears, and at {{us for our}} {{counselling}} Witta <b>to</b> <b>furl</b> sail when the ship pitched at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep {{her dead}} away!" [...] added the still calm but deeply {{authoritative}} {{voice of the}} young Commander [...] "Stand by <b>to</b> <b>furl</b> the fore-topsail--let it hang a moment to drag the ship clear of the wreck--cut cut--cheerily, men--hatchets and knives--cut with all, and cut off all!" ...|$|E
60|$|With all haste we {{proceeded}} <b>to</b> <b>furl</b> the sails, which, {{owing to}} the calm, had been hanging loose in the brails. And by help of a spare boom, used on the forecastle-deck sit a sweep or great oar, we endeavored to cast the brigantine's head toward the foe.|$|E
50|$|Supporting - Halyards {{raise and}} lower the yards. Brails run from the leech to the spar <b>to</b> {{facilitate}} <b>furling.</b> Buntlines serve <b>to</b> raise the foot up for shortening sail or for furling. Lifts adjust the tilt of a yard, to raise or lower the ends off the horizontal. Leechlines run to the leech (outer vertical edges) of a sail and serve to pull the leech both in and up when furling.|$|R
5000|$|David OConnell has {{described}} Conquered Banner as echoing Ralph Waldo Emersons extremely popular [...] "Concord Hymn". According to OConnell, readers would have unconsciously {{have thought of}} Emersons poem about [...] "Concord" [...] when Ryan used the word [...] "conquered", and by echoing Emersons reference <b>to</b> a <b>furled</b> flag, Ryan would have enhanced the patriotic resonance his poem had among Southern readers brought up reciting Emersons [...] "Concord Hymn". The final verse reads: ...|$|R
50|$|Mast aft rigs {{depend on}} a large {{foresail}} which, like any sail, becomes more difficult to manage with its size. This is particularly true when sailors do not want <b>to</b> use roller <b>furling,</b> e.g., {{because they do not}} want to compromise speed.|$|R
60|$|As we came still nearer, {{distinctly}} beholding their faces, we loudly hailed them, {{inviting them}} <b>to</b> <b>furl</b> their sails, and {{allow us to}} board them. But no answer was returned; their confusion increasing. And now, within less than two ships'-lengths, they swept right across our bow, gazing at us with blended curiosity and fear.|$|E
60|$|Here we lay forty-eight hours, {{during which}} the cold was intense. I {{wondered}} at the liquid sea, which refused to freeze in such a temperature. The clear, cold sky overhead looked like a steel-blue cymbal, that might ring, could you smite it. Our breath came and went like puffs' of smoke from pipe-bowls. At first {{there was a long}} gauky swell, that obliged us <b>to</b> <b>furl</b> most of the sails, and even send down t'-gallant-yards, for fear of pitching them overboard.|$|E
60|$|But the inventions {{of science}} have now very much lessened {{the danger of}} these storms. The barometer, by the sudden fall of its column of mercury, tells, as plainly and {{certainly}} as if it spoke with an audible voice, that a storm is approaching, even though all nature should appear to contradict the fact by its calm and serene aspect; so that the crew thus warned have time <b>to</b> <b>furl</b> the sails, fasten down the hatches, and otherwise prepare to face the impending danger.|$|E
5000|$|Willis {{enlisted in}} the Navy from his birth state of Massachusetts {{and served as a}} coxswain aboard the [...] during the search for the missing {{exploration}} ship Polaris. When an Arctic gale struck Tigress off the coast of Greenland on the night of September 22, 1873, Willis volunteered <b>to</b> single-handedly <b>furl</b> (lower, roll up and secure) the loose fore topgallant sail, an act which prevented damage to the ship. For his conduct on that occasion, he was awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|R
50|$|The Shenandoah was {{launched}} as Sea King on August 17, 1863, and would {{become one of}} the most feared commerce raiders in the Confederate Navy. She surrendered on the River Mersey, Liverpool, England, on November 6, 1865. Her flag was the last sovereign Confederate flag <b>to</b> be officially <b>furled.</b>|$|R
50|$|In square rigged ships the staysails {{can help}} in tacking, {{overcoming}} the lumbering square sails' tendency to prevent bearing up to windward, especially in light winds. Where a ship attempts to tack but fails and has to bear away again on the original tack, {{she is said to}} have missed her stays. In cutter rigged yachts the genoa will often need <b>to</b> be <b>furled</b> before changing tack due to the difficulty in passing the big sail between the two forestays. Here the staysail can help bring the bow through the wind more effectively.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all, mother. It is {{only that}} you are now captain of the ship, and have got to give your orders instead of {{carrying}} them out yourself. Father did not pull up the ropes or go aloft <b>to</b> <b>furl</b> the sails, while I have no doubt he had plenty to do in seeing that his orders were carried out. You will be worse off than he was, for he had John Wilkes, and others, who knew their duty, while I have got almost everything to learn." ...|$|E
60|$|The first infraction of our {{agreement}} {{was on the}} main-lower-topsail. This they attempted <b>to</b> <b>furl.</b> The carrying away of the crojack and the blowing away of the mizzen-lower-topsail gave me freedom to see and aim, and when the tiny messengers from my rifle began to spat through the canvas and to spat against the steel of the yard, the men strung along it desisted from passing the gaskets. I waved my will to Bert Rhine, who acknowledged me and ordered the sail set again and the yard trimmed.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true, madam," [...] {{returned}} the captain with an approving nod. [...] "I see you've got a mechanical eye--there's {{a difference of}} elevation 'tween the box and the bed of three inches or more, but bless you, that's nothin' to speak of. If you'd {{ever been in a}} gale o' wind at sea you'd know that we seadogs are used to considerable difference of elevation between our heads an' feet. My top-coat stuffed in'll put that to rights. But you'll have <b>to</b> <b>furl</b> the flummery tops'ls--to lower 'em altogether would be safer." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>To</b> be {{successfully}} <b>furled,</b> a sail must be {{flexible enough to}} wrap around a tight radius. Sail stiffening devices such as battens can be accommodated by roller furling systems when they lie parallel to the mast; otherwise furling must be stopped at the lowest batten or the battens must be removed.|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} furlable antenna particularly {{suited for}} use in a celestial space environment is described. The antenna is characterized by an actuator comprising an elastomeric member of an annular configuration, an annular array of uniformly spaced antenna ribs rigidly affixed at the base ends to an actuator which enables it to be supported for pivotal displacement from a deployed configuration. The ribs are radially extended from the actuator <b>to</b> a <b>furled</b> configuration. The ribs are extended parallel to the axis of the actuator with flexible reflecting web affixed to the ribs, with angularly spaced bearing blocks...|$|R
5000|$|The Furlings are {{revealed}} {{as one of}} the alliance of four great races in , but virtually nothing else has been revealed about them in the series. In [...] "Paradise Lost", Harry Maybourne leads SG-1 <b>to</b> a <b>Furling</b> teleportation arch that leads to an intended Utopian colony. Furling skeletons were originally planned to be featured in the episode, but the production of such proved to be too expensive. Jack O'Neill concludes that the Furlings must be cute and cuddly creatures, based solely on their name. In [...] "Citizen Joe", another character equates the Furlings to Ewoks based on their name.|$|R
6000|$|... "Neither Neb, nor the cook, nor I, {{am a man}} {{of other}} times, but are all men of to-day; so you must call us but three, after all. I know we can do much; but a gale may come that would teach us our insignificance. As it is, we are barely able <b>to</b> <b>furl</b> the main-top-gallant-sail in a squall, leaving one hand at the wheel, and another to let go rigging. No, no, Moses; we must admit we are rather short-handed, putting the best face on the matter." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{went toward}} them--a solitary figure, {{in a blue}} and gray striped {{sleeping}} suit and a pipe-clayed cork helmet on its head. Their disgust was extreme. They had expected surgical cases. Each one had brought his carving tools with him. But they soon got over their little disappointment. In {{less than five minutes}} one of the steam launches was rushing shoreward to order a big boat and some hospital people for the removal of the crew. The big steam pinnace went off to her ship to bring over a few bluejackets <b>to</b> <b>furl</b> my sails for me.|$|E
60|$|On {{a voyage}} to India, {{they had a}} fever aboard, which carried off nearly half the crew {{in the space of}} a few days. After this the men never went aloft in the night-time, except in couples. When topsails were to be reefed, phantoms were seen at the yard-arm ends; and in tacking ship, voices called aloud from the tops. The {{carpenter}} himself, going with another man <b>to</b> <b>furl</b> the main-top-gallant-sail in a squall, was nearly pushed from the rigging by an unseen hand; and his shipmate swore that a wet hammock was flirted in his face.|$|E
50|$|The furling {{system itself}} {{is very simple}} in concept. The {{leading edge of the}} sail (luff) <b>to</b> be <b>furled</b> is {{stiffened}} in some way, such as by attaching it to a length of plastic pipe or by sewing in a stiff material such as foam. This stiffened edge serves to spread the force of the furler {{along the edge of the}} sail, so that the sail will furl along its full length. This stiffened edge is then attached to the source of energy for furling, which may be a handle that is turned, a spool containing a line that is pulled, or a motor.|$|R
50|$|Furling {{works by}} {{decreasing}} {{the angle of}} attack, which reduces the induced drag from the lift of the rotor, {{as well as the}} cross-section. One major problem in designing wind turbines is getting the blades <b>to</b> stall or <b>furl</b> quickly enough should a gust of wind cause sudden acceleration. A fully furled turbine blade, when stopped, has the edge of the blade facing into the wind.|$|R
25|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} steampowered {{vessels in the}} world's merchant marine services {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries radically altered the economics of seafaring. Without acres of canvas <b>to</b> be <b>furled</b> and unfurled, the demand for unskilled labor (and, by extension, crimping) greatly diminished. The sinking of the RMS Titanic, followed by onset of World War I (which made the high seas a much more dangerous place due to the threat of submarine attack) provided the final impetus to stamp out the practice. In 1915, Andrew Furuseth and Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr. pushed through the Seamen's Act of 1915 that made crimping a federal crime, and finally put an end to it.|$|R
