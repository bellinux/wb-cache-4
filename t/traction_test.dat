Six pigs’ jaws were used and three implants were placed on each side of them for a total of 36 fixtures. Twelve bars were connected to the abutments (each bar on three implants) by using, on one side, laser welding and, on the other, resistance spot welding. Temperature variations were recorded by thermocouples and by thermal camera while the strength of the welded joint was analyzed by a <b>traction</b> <b>test.</b> Results.

Sixty-five cases were retrieved. Seventy-four surgeries were required. The IO myectomy and simultaneous groups included 48 and 17 cases, respectively. Pre-operative vertical deviation was significantly lower in the IO myectomy (11. 8 prism diopters) than in the simultaneous (27. 2 prism diopters; Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0. 001) group. The mean induced changes were 9. 4 prism diopters and 21. 6 prism diopters in the IO myectomy and simultaneous groups, respectively, and the postoperative vertical deviation was not significantly different.

The most widely accepted method is lateral bending radiographs, but this is limited by patient cooperation and intertechnician variability. Therefore, Hirsch et al. [28] investigated a new standardized technique, the EOS® suspension test, for evaluating spinal flexibility in 50 AIS patients scheduled for operation. In it, the patient is subjected to progressive traction forces through a rigid collar attached to cables until they are on tiptoes, at which level the EOS® radiographs are taken. They compared the reduction achieved by this technique to that of the supine <b>traction</b> <b>test</b> on a Cotrel frame. Compared to the <b>traction</b> <b>test,</b> higher forces were applied during the EOS® suspension test, and these forces were more standardized. However, the tolerance of the patient was lower in the EOS® suspension test. The major advantage of this technique is the ability to analyze coronal, sagittal, and axial reduction in a single standardized setting.|$|E

The following cements were tested: Compolute composite cement (Espe), C/B Crown & Bridge Luting Composite (Bisco), Diamond Link cement (DRM) with Harvard cement as a control. The cementing procedures laid down by the manufacturers were followed in the case of each cement.

40|$|SUMMARY A 49 -year-old {{woman with}} {{generalised}} lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and morphoea developed bilateral Brown's syndrome. Some {{of the skin}} lesions were {{in the vicinity of}} the trochlea. A characteristic feature of morphoea is subcutaneous fibrosis, so we postulate that the cause of the Brown's syndrome was mechanical tethering of the superior oblique tendon by deep subdermal fibrosis. Histopathological diagnosis was made from biopsies of similar lesions on the patient's face. In 1950 HW Brown ' first published his series of seven cases with the following clinical features: slight downdrift of the affected eye on adduction; limita-tion of elevation on adduction; widening of the palpebral fissure on adduction; no overaction of the ipsilateral superior oblique; V exo pattern; positive <b>traction</b> <b>test.</b> He suggested that this syndrome was due to congenital paralysis of the inferior oblique muscle resulting in a short anterior superior oblique tendon sheath. In a further publication 2 he divided his cases of superior oblique tendon sheath syndrome into two types-true and simulated cases. The true cases were those with a congenitally short anterior sheath of the superior oblique tendon. These patients had a positive <b>traction</b> <b>test.</b> The simulated cases were all others, either congenital or acquired. The congenital simulated cases were postulated to have a thick posterior tendon or firm attachment of the posterior sheath to the tendon. The acquired cases were of inflammatory origin. In 1975 Parks and M Brown ' reviewed the theories of true Brown's syndrome and were unable to demonstrate H W Brown's findings of a short anterior sheath except in two of the 24 patients in whom they had surgically explored the orbit. They suggested that the usual cause of Brown's syndrome was a restrictive connective tissue band situated posteriorly and inferiorly to the globe. In 1977 Parks 4 suggested that Brown's syndrome was due to a tau...|$|E
