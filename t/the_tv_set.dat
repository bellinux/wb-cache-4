25|$|Internet {{television}} {{should not}} to be confused with Smart TV, IPTV or with Web TV. Smart television refers to <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>set</b> that has an inbuilt operating system. Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. Web television is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.|$|E
25|$|The SITE {{transmissions}} had a {{very significant}} impact in the Indian villages. For the entire year, thousands of villagers gathered around <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>set</b> and watched the shows. Studies were conducted on the social impact of the experiment and on viewership trends. It was found that general interest and viewership were highest {{in the first few}} months of the program (200 to 600 people per TV set) and then declined gradually (60 to 80 people per TV set). This decline was due to several factors, including faults developing in the television equipment, failure in electricity supply, and hardware defects, as also the villagers' pre-occupation with domestic or agricultural work. Impact on the rural population was highest in the fields of agriculture and family planning. Nearly 52% of viewers reported themselves amenable to applying the new knowledge gained by them.|$|E
25|$|Kupcinet {{apparently}} {{went straight}} home after dining with her friends. She was visited by freelance writer Edward Stephen Rubin shortly afterward. The two were then joined by actor Robert Hathaway around 9:30 pm. They told detectives they watched TV, including The Danny Kaye Show, with Kupcinet. They all drank coffee until she fell asleep, {{sitting next to}} them on the couch. She awoke and went to her room. The men either turned <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>set</b> off or simply lowered the volume (three days later it was still playing with a low volume), and made sure the door was locked behind them before departing at about 11:15 pm. Hathaway said Rubin and he returned to his place and were later joined by Kupcinet's boyfriend, Andrew Prine, who was also Hathaway's neighbor. The three young men watched television and talked until around 3:00 am.|$|E

5000|$|Uruguayan URSEC {{authorities}} {{provided no}} information on which road {{they would go}} until late in 2007. On August 27, 2007, Ursec settled on DVB-T and DVB-H. <b>The</b> <b>TV</b> <b>sets</b> being sold in Uruguay seem {{to be closer to}} ATSC HDTV-based standards (60 Hz systems, with ATSC tuners in some cases). Most of the DVD-based content in the country is NTSC/60 Hz-based, while <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> standard in use is PAL/50 Hz-based. Most of <b>the</b> analog <b>TV</b> <b>sets</b> sold are PAL-N, PAL-M and NTSC-capable, while most DVD players are multiregion. Authorities are not asking retailers to identify which standard the HDTV sets sold adhere to. It seems that most HDTV standards support both 60/50 streams, so that should not be an issue since <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>sets</b> will have to also support both standards to be certified.|$|R
25|$|The DRS {{undertook}} {{terrestrial broadcasting}} for large cities and direct broadcasting to SITE television sets for remote villages. However, {{it did not}} provide for small towns where <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>set</b> density was {{higher than in the}} villages while not as much as in a city. The concept of a low-power limited rebroadcast (LRB) TV transmitter system was evolved to overcome such situations. The LRB consisted of a simple receiver system having a 4.5m chicken-mesh parabolic antenna with a low-noise block converter, that served as the front-end for a low-power TV transmitter at the same location. Two suitable locations, Sambalpur in Orissa (75 villages) and Muzaffarpur in Bihar (110 villages), were tentatively identified for implementing LRB transmitter systems. This experiment was expected to provide useful data on the trade-off between DRS and LRB. However, due to financial constraints, these two LRBs had to be shelved, and instead an LRB was set up at SHAR, Sriharikota.|$|E
25|$|Saorview, {{founded by}} 2RN, {{is the name}} for the Irish FTA DTT. The service was {{launched}} as a trial service on 31 October 2010 to 90% {{of the population and}} it was officially launched on 26 May 2011. Set-top boxes for the service are available By legislation it must be available nationwide by December 2011. The service is free although a MPEG-4 DVB-T box and a UHF aerial will be needed although some newer TV sets have MPEG-4 DVB-T decoders built into <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>set</b> which do not need a separate box. 2RN can provide for commercial DTT capacity on its network for any pay TV service that can agree terms with it and the BAI. However that is likely until 2013 according to the BAI following on from a de-briefing exercise the BAI held with the three consortia involved in the 2008 failed license process. The BAI said the Authority now considers that it will not be feasible to introduce commercial DTT as originally intended until after Analogue Switch Off (ASO) at the earliest. The position will be reviewed towards the end of 2011 and the Authority may seek expressions of interest in the provision of commercial DTT at that point. A competition could potentially be held during 2012 with a view to commercial DTT being operational in 2013. It continued it is the considered view of the Authority that as part of the preparation for the successful launch of commercial DTT in the future, legislative change will be necessary to enable the Authority to have formal relationships with the applicants, as obtains at present, and with RTÉNL.|$|E
