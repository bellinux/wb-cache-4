5|$|Some {{critics have}} {{compared}} 30 Rock to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, with parallels drawn between {{the relationship of}} Liz and Jack and that of Mary Richards and Lou Grant. It has also been compared to <b>That</b> <b>Girl.</b> Like <b>That</b> <b>Girl</b> and Mary Tyler Moore, 30 Rock is a sitcom centering on an unmarried, brunette career woman living {{in a big city}} where she works in the television industry. <b>That</b> <b>Girl</b> was parodied in the opening segment of 30 Rocks pilot.|$|E

There were unconfirmed sightings of Girl Pat in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere. As weeks passed with no definite news, the Marstrand directors assumed that the vessel was lost, either through foundering or barratry, and claimed insurance. They had already received sums totalling £2,400 from the underwriters, when they were surprised by the arrival of bills from Corcubión, together with the news <b>that</b> <b>Girl</b> Pat had sailed from the port on 24 April, her destination unknown.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, Madonna was {{shooting}} for her third motion picture Who's <b>That</b> <b>Girl,</b> {{known at the}} time as Slammer. Needing songs for the soundtrack of the movie, she contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, who had written and produced her third studio album True Blue in 1986. Madonna explained to them that she needed an uptempo song and a downtempo song. She came to the studio one Thursday as Leonard developed the chorus of the song. He handed over that cassette to Madonna, who went to the backroom and finished the melody and the lyrics of the song, while Leonard worked on the other parts of the song.|$|E
5|$|Madonna {{embarked}} on the Who's <b>That</b> <b>Girl</b> World Tour in July 1987, which continued until September. It broke several attendance records, including over 130,000 audience in a concert near Paris, which remains her biggest concert attendance ever. Later that year, she released a remix album of past hits, titled You Can Dance, which reached number14 on the Billboard 200.

5|$|Madonna's 1987 Who's <b>That</b> <b>Girl</b> World Tour was a {{critical}} and commercial success, earning US $25million and playing {{in front of an}} audience of 1.5million. When the time came for the video release of the tour, Warner Bros. decided to release it only in Japan, where Madonna's previous video albums had not been released. This decision was also backed by the profit that the Who's <b>That</b> <b>Girl</b> World Tour had achieved from its Japanese leg. Named as Who's That Girl: Live in Japan, the video contained a live date from the tour, filmed at Korakuen Stadium in Tokyo, Japan on June 22, 1987. It was also aired as a television special in Japan only and was the first television broadcast there, using Dolby Surround sound. The release was a commercial success, prompting Warner to release a different version of the tour video, for the rest of the world. Although the Japanese concert was released on VHS and LaserDisc, Warner Music Japan has never officially made it available on DVD.|$|E

5|$|The {{album was}} {{promoted}} on Madonna's second concert tour, the Who's <b>That</b> <b>Girl</b> World Tour, which visited cities of North America, Europe and Asia in 1987.

The album's singles and their accompanying music videos have sparked debates among scholars and social groups. She became the first female artist to receive the Video Vanguard Award at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards in recognition of her impact on popular culture.

5|$|The {{music video}} portrayed a {{different}} persona of Madonna, rather than her film character {{for which it}} was released.

Madonna has performed the song on her Who's <b>That</b> <b>Girl</b> World Tour (1987) and on the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–2016). The song has been covered by many artists and has appeared in compilations and tribute albums.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In Egypt, {{girls have}} {{traditionally}} been educationally disadvantaged. This disadvantage, however, {{has been focused on}} the failure to enter school. Increasingly it is recognized <b>that</b> <b>girls</b> who ever-enroll are at least as likely to complete primary and secondary education as boys. Still the belief persists <b>that</b> <b>girls,</b> especially those from poor families, will be disadvantaged in terms of school expenditures and the transitions to secondary and higher education. We examine expenditures on tutoring during the final year of preparatory school, and the transition to specific tracks of secondary education. Tests during the last year of preparatory largely determine a student’s educational future. Results show <b>that</b> <b>girls,</b> even girls from poor families, are not disadvantaged in terms of expenditures, whether for tutoring, fees or general expenses. Moreover, girls are more likely than boys to advance to general secondary education, the track that leads to higher education...|$|R

5|$|Ciao Italia: Live from Italy (credited as Madonna: Ciao, Italia! Live from Italy in {{the video}} sequence) is a video album by American singer-songwriter Madonna and was {{released}} by Warner Reprise Video and Sire Records on May 24, 1988. It contained footage from a previous TV special of the Who's <b>That</b> <b>Girl</b> World Tour, Madonna in Concerto, broadcast in Europe in 1987, filmed at the Stadio Comunale in Turin, Italy. The video release also contained footage from shows recorded in Florence, Italy and Tokyo, Japan, the latter having previously been released as a Japanese TV special and home video release, Who's That Girl: Live in Japan. The decision to release Ciao Italia was spurred {{by the fact that}} this previous release became a commercial success in Japan. A re-release of the video took place in 1999, when it was released in DVD format, with a stereo soundtrack containing the songs only.|$|E

She is almost won over, until she sees Dr. Dillamond, who has lost the power of speech. She vows to fight the Wizard until the end. Fiyero and the guards enter, followed by Glinda. Fiyero helps Elphaba escape, and decides to escape with her, leaving Glinda behind. Though she was broken-hearted, Glinda reminds the Wizard and Madame Morrible that the way to recapture Elphaba is to make her think her sister is in trouble, and she will be sure to come to her rescue. She mourns that Fiyero does not love her ("I'm Not <b>that</b> <b>Girl,</b> Reprise").|$|E
