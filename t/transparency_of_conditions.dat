The research of entrepreneurs’ opinions about business environment in Czech Republic was carried out in 2015. We found that financial risk intensively impacts business environment, while only a small group of entrepreneurs stated they are able to properly manage those risks. Entrepreneurs agreed that the importance of credit risk increased during the crisis. Small and medium enterprises demonstrated better knowledge <b>of</b> credit <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> commercial banks and gave more positive assessment <b>of</b> the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> these <b>conditions</b> as compared to micro-enterprises. © CSR, 2015...|$|R

40|$|Following John Rawls, {{writers like}} Bernard Williams and Christine Korsgaard have {{suggested}} that a transparency condition should be put on ethical theories. The exact nature <b>of</b> such a <b>condition</b> and its implications is however not anything on which there is any consensus. It is argued here that the ultimate rationale <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> <b>conditions</b> is epistemic rather than substantively moral, but also that it clearly connects to substantive concerns about moral psychology.

40|$|Breakfast is {{purported to}} confer {{a number of}} {{benefits}} on diet quality, health, appetite regulation, and cognitive performance. However, new evidence has challenged the long-held belief that breakfast {{is the most important}} meal of the day. This review aims to provide a comprehensive discussion of the key methodological challenges and considerations in studies assessing the effect of breakfast on cognitive performance and appetite control, along with recommendations for future research. This review focuses on the myriad challenges involved in studying children and adolescents specifically. Key methodological challenges and considerations include study design and location, sampling and sample section, choice of objective cognitive tests, choice of objective and subjective appetite measures, merits of providing a fixed breakfast compared with ad libitum, assessment and definition of habitual breakfast consumption, <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> treatment <b>condition,</b> difficulty <b>of</b> isolating the direct effects of breakfast consumption, untangling acute and chronic effects, and influence of confounding variables. These methodological challenges have hampered a clear substantiation of the potential positive effects of breakfast on cognition and appetite control and contributed to the debate questioning the notion that breakfast is the most important meal of the day...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{studies are}} not {{conclusive}} {{in favor of}} a strong relationship between the financial literacy and the ability to take better borrowing decisions. Results are quite heterogeneous and often point out the relevance of other factors, such as socio-demographic features or practical experience gained with daily use of financial products. The impact of (the amount and quality of) information available at the time of consumer choice is still unexplored. The objective {{of this paper is to}} fill in this literature gap and explore a large set of possible drivers of borrowing decisions in the consumer finance framework, with a specific focus on the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> price <b>conditions.</b> We interviewed a sample of 299 consumers. They were asked to select the best option between five series of credit alternatives. In order to explore the role <b>of</b> <b>transparency,</b> each series <b>of</b> loans was presented with three different sets of information, with an increasing level of detail. The ability to select the best alternative was measured calculating a score based on the Net Present Value criterion, and analysed as the dependent variable of a regression model with demographic, socioeconomic and financial characteristics as predictors. Our findings show that the amount and quality of available information strongly influence the choice. At the same time, an high level of education do not seem to play a significant role. Financial maturity results to positive influence the ability to select the best alternative and employed people perform better than non-working respondents. ...|$|R
40|$|Mental {{capacity}} and autonomy are often {{understood to be}} normatively neutral - the only values or other norms they may presuppose are those the assessed person does or would accept. We show how mental disorder threatens normatively neutral accounts of autonomy. These accounts produce false positives, {{particularly in the case}} of disorders (such as depression, anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia) that affect evaluative abilities. Two normatively neutral strategies for handling autonomy-undermining disorder are explored and rejected: a blanket exclusion of mental disorder, and functional tests requiring consistency, expression of identity, reflective non-alienation or lack of compulsion. Finally, we suggest ways in which substantivist alternatives to neutrality can be made more promising through increased <b>transparency,</b> democratic contestability <b>of</b> <b>conditions</b> for {{capacity and}} autonomy, and a historically sensitive caution concerning restrictions of liberty.

40|$|Regarding the {{organisation}} of the railway in Croatian ports, the institutional framework {{on which the}} railway within the port operates is relatively uncertain with potential conflicts of the national and EU legislation as well as diversities in practical approaches from the governing institutions towards empirical solutions on the field. This paper develops possible models for organisation of the management of rail transport services within the port area in order to research governance mechanism and provide standards of quality of railway operations, which are {{in accordance with the}} existing legal framework and on best practice solutions. This models are developed in order to enable several main principles important for port operations and business development such as <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> the access <b>conditions</b> and service prices, single entry point, services in the rail terminal fully coordinated with the capacity allocation, performance scheme as part of the infrastructure charging system, performance targets in the form of indicators, access to topical reports on the service quality of the service in the port terminal, and implementation of the use-it-or leave-it rule...|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} two period model of {{political}} competition in which voters imperfectly observe the electoral promises made to other voters. Imperfect observability generates {{an incentive for}} candidates to offer excessive transfers even if voters are homogeneous and taxation is distortionary. Government spending is larger than {{in a world of}} perfect observability. Transfers are partly financed through government debt, {{and the size of the}} debt is higher in less transparent political systems. The model provides an explanation of fiscal churning; it also predicts that groups whose transfers are less visible to others receive higher transfers, and that imperfect <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> transfers may lead to underprovision of public goods. From the policy perspective, the main novelty of our analysis is a separate evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> spending and the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> revenues. We show that the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> the political system does not unambiguously improve efficiency: <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> spending is beneficial, but <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> revenues can be counterproductive because it endogenously leads to increased wasteful spending. 1...|$|R

DSSC can be transparent with various degrees <b>of</b> <b>transparency,</b> which makes it suitable for window application in buildings. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the <b>transparency,</b> the efficiency <b>of</b> DSSC and the overall energy efficiency of a building when DSSC is applied as window system. It is shown that while the efficiency of less transparent DSSC is generally higher due to higher short circuit current density (J(sc)) from the thick electrode, it does not necessarily maximize the overall energy efficiency of a building. This is because lighting <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> the building varies with the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> the window. The optimum condition should be carefully considered with the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> window as computationally simulated in terms of energy generation and consumption. We also find that different orientations of window in the building affect the optimum <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> DSSC. close 332...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the degree <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> the Web pages of {{organizations}} that belong to the world of sports, specifically golf courses in Andalusia. Design/methodology/approach: We performed a descriptive analysis <b>of</b> the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> 92 Web pages of golf clubs registered on the official website of the Royal Golf Federation of Andalusia (RFGA). A questionnaire created/adapted ad hoc is used for this study having as a reference the questionnaire used by Barrio and Martin (2012) that analyze the performance <b>of</b> the 4 <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> Web pages. Findings: To reflect a high degree <b>of</b> <b>transparency,</b> they show a higher compliance than 75 % in 8 of the 10 variables. The Web page becomes an element to quantify the performance of the field without investing too much in other promotional channels to attract as many customers as possible. Research limitations: In some Web pages, the access to information entailed a significant investment of time because they did not have the characteristic of being intuitive. In some cases was not available all required information. Practical implications: Knowledge of this information allows the director or manager identifies possible areas of improvement to optimize their management, while transparency offered by the golf courses is improved. Social implications: This study highlights the need for teaching the user to evaluate the quality, transparency and being critical with the information found on Web pages. Originality/value: The analysis <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> allows clubs to be reflective of its golf courses. It becomes the tool that the manager can use to display part of all its virtues and to evaluate the social behavior of their customers, to attract possible clients and perform actions with the stakeholders in the golf industry...|$|R
