She tells Don the client ultimately went with the same ad as before, only in a Paris setting. Don says Ginsberg will take over once the Jaguar pitch is finished, prompting Peggy to reply {{that she is not}} in charge of everything. Don pulls some money from his wallet and condescendingly <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> in Peggy's face, telling her that if she wants to go to Paris, she should just go. Ken tries to comfort her, saying that Don is just upset about Jaguar, to which she replies that she does not care.|$|E

6000|$|Norah's {{self-control}} {{began to}} show signs of failing her. Her dark cheeks glowed, her delicate lips trembled, before she spoke again. Magdalen paid more attention to her parasol than to her sister. She <b>tossed</b> <b>it</b> high in the air and caught it. [...] "Once!" [...] she said--and <b>tossed</b> <b>it</b> up again. [...] "Twice!"--and she <b>tossed</b> <b>it</b> higher. [...] "Thrice--" [...] Before she could catch it for the third time, Norah seized her passionately by the arm, and the parasol dropped to the ground between them.|$|R

5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E

25|$|The slam of Cox's {{dressing}} room door awakens Box, who suddenly remembers his bacon. When {{he sees a}} mutton chop on the gridiron, he assumes it is Bouncer's, and throws it out the window, hitting a pedestrian outside. He once again puts the bacon on the fire, and goes to his {{dressing room}} to retrieve his breakfast utensils. The slam of Box’s dressing room door sends Cox scurrying back in, assuming it {{is the sound of}} someone knocking. Seeing the bacon on the gridiron once again, he <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> out the window, hitting the pedestrian for a second time.|$|E

They can be seen when Frodo is {{captured}} by the orcs of Cirith Ungol and his mithril shirt leads to a confrontation between Shagrat, a Black Uruk of Mordor, and an orc from Minas Morgul called Gorbag. Gorbag threatens to stab Shagrat if he tries to steal the shirt, but he <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> aside and throws Gorbag down a long flight of stairs, where he falls on top of several other Uruk-hai. A huge brawl between orcs and Uruk-hai spreads all over the fortress, allowing Sam to enter the tower with ease.|$|E

500|$|Bryan Ryan (Neil Patrick Harris), {{a former}} McKinley High glee club member, arrives as an auditor {{from the school}} board.

Having failed to realize his own dreams, he intends to cut the glee club. Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) convinces him that it is not too late to pursue his dreams and sings [...] "Piano Man" [...] with him.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Ironic" [...] was {{directed}} by Stéphane Sednaoui.|publisher=Allmusic. Rovi Corporation|accessdate=April 14, 2011}} In {{the beginning of the}} video, Morissette is at a gas station, walking to her automobile {{with a cup of coffee}} in her hand. Then, she drives her car through a winter landscape, and she begins to sing the song's first verse. When it comes to the chorus, a second Morissette comes in. She is in a green sweater and sits in the backseat on the passenger side. When the first chorus ends, a third Morissette comes in, and she is in a yellow sweater with braided hair, also in the backseat, but on the driver's side. Along the way, the yellow Morissette is singing and eating at the same time, and when it comes to the second verse, a fourth and last Morissette comes in, she is in a red sweater sitting in the front passenger seat. During the second chorus, she climbs out of the window when they are still driving and almost gets knocked out by a bridge, but still manages a smile after doing so. The camera comes back to the driving Morissette, after the breakdown, and she takes off her hat, <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> into the back seat, and becomes as loud as the other three while singing the song. When Morissette sings the outro, she is still driving through the winter landscape, and suddenly the car breaks down (possibly having run out of gas, which may be [...] "ironic" [...] in itself since the video started with her at a gas station). Morissette (as the driver) gets out of the car, and all her [...] "passengers" [...] have disappeared.|$|E
500|$|The film {{opens with}} an inter-title that reads [...] "Poor little rich girl has {{no one to}} play with" [...] and cuts to Baby Helen with her doll, looking out the window. A group of {{children}} play Ring a Ring o' Roses in the yard. Next, Baby Helen goes to tea party {{set up on the}} yard and holds her doll, all by herself, with a lonely expression. The neighbor's dog, Shep comes out of his dog house and barks, and Baby Helen rises with a joyful expression. She takes a piece of a muffin and <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> through the boxwood hedge separating the two yards. Shep eats the muffin and Helen invites him to her tea party. Shep runs along the hedge and passes through to join her. Helen instructs Shep with her finger and Shep barks in understanding, Helen takes her seat and shares a muffin with Shep. An inter-title announces that a week later, Helen is out on an errand. Helen passes through the hedge and skips down the sidewalk and Shep barks at her. As Helen crosses the street, she is struck by a passing automobile and Shep races to the rescue. He tugs at her dress at the waist and finding that he is unable to move her, runs to Helen's home and jumps against the screen door, barking repeatedly. As Helen's parents are summoned, Shep leads them to Helen, where a passerby has scooped up Helen {{from the middle of the}} street. All three depart and the scene changes to a dimly lit room with Helen laid on a bed, seemingly dead. Her parents watch over her, with sad faces as a doctor inspects her and folds her arms across her chest. Beyond saving, her parents bury their heads in the pillow next to Helen as the doctor pens a note. Then Shep is shown resting against the side of the door in a feeble and sorrowful looking position.|$|E
