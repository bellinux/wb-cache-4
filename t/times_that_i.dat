[...] His parents were German ethnics from Ukraine which had immigrated to Saskatchewan from the Ukraine in 1911. [...] Growing up, his first language was Low German. [...] In the 1700s, Catherine the Great encouraged Central European farmers to settle in Russia. [...] As the rights afforded to these settlers by Catherine were gradually diminished, many of the settlers headed to North America, with Saskatchewan offering good farmland, and other incentives for immigrants. Taube reflected fondly on his experiences growing up in Saskatchewan, noting: [...] "Certainly, there is nothing about my first 21 years in Saskatchewan, taken {{in the context of}} those <b>times</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would wish to be changed. [...] The advantages that I enjoyed include: [...] the marvelous experience of growing up on a farm, which taught me an appreciation of nature, and taught me also to discipline myself to get necessary jobs done..." ...|$|E

I think it's important to show that other people go through it. [...] I hope [...] see what I say in the song is, 'I love you,' so many <b>times,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> need him and the crazy things in my life. I hope he sees the positive side of the video rather than the negative. The video is kind of offensive, but it is very raw. He's my father. I need someone to walk me down the aisle when I get married." [...] The single's b-side, [...] "My Innocence", features a similar message to Lohan's father.|$|E

Of course, that depends on their expertise. As an independent producer, I {{have to be a}} type of skilled laborer. There were many <b>times</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had to make a film quickly. At those times, I kept entertainment-value in mind. Not once have I made a film for the sake of making the film itself. My taste is in looking through the camera. Filming happens to correspond with that taste. Art films are what Yu Hyun-mok makes. That's because director Yu wants to make art films. I just make films by following my heart, so the analysis I leave to all of you." [...] Kim Ki-youngAlthough a critically acclaimed, financially successful independent filmmaker, Kim was not immune from governmental pressure. He filmed Ban Geum-ryeon in 1975, but it was banned at the time, and not released until 1981, with 40 minutes of footage censored. The government also coerced Kim into making an anti-Communist propaganda film. The resulting film, Love of Blood Relations (1976), transcended the bounds of propaganda by portraying the communist agent as one of Kim's typical femme fatale characters. Kim later commented, [...] "North or south, capitalist or communist, ideology is far less interesting to me than the things that divide the sexes." ...|$|E
