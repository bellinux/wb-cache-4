A 2003 study from Cornell University found that cocoa contains {{large amounts of}} antioxidants <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> prevent cancer. Also, it has been demonstrated that the cocoa bean helps with digestion. From the 16th to 19th centuries, {{hot chocolate}} was valued as a medicine {{as well as a}} drink.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{suggestions}} that leaf shedding {{may be a}} response that provides protection against diseases and certain kinds of pests such as leaf miners and gall forming insects. Other responses such as the change of leaf colors prior to fall have also been suggested as adaptations <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> undermine the camouflage of herbivores. Autumn leaf color has also been suggested {{to act as an}} honest warning signal of defensive commitment towards insect pests that migrate to the trees in autumn.|$|E
5|$|It was {{confirmed}} on June 8, 2015, at Apple's WWDC that the iPad 2 would support iOS 9. This makes the iPad 2 the first iPad and only iOS device to support six major versions of iOS. As with previous releases, though, many headline features are unavailable on the iPad 2, including predictive Siri, translucency effects, split-view, slide-over and picture-in-picture multitasking, Low Power Mode and the Health app. iOS 9 {{is said to}} feature performance improvements <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> the aging device function more smoothly, and initial tests suggest {{that it did not}} significantly impact available space. Other A5-based devices will also support iOS 9 including the iPhone 4S (five major iOS versions), the iPad Mini (four major iOS versions) and iPod Touch 5G (four major iOS versions).|$|E

5|$|Relatively new {{cells in}} a groove {{on the edges}} of the mantle secrete {{material}} that extends the periostracum. These cells are gradually displaced to the underside of the mantle by more recent cells in the groove, and switch to secreting the mineralized material of the shell valves. In other words, {{on the edge of the}} valve the periostracum is extended first, and then reinforced by extension of the mineralized layers under the periostracum. In most species the edge of the mantle also bears movable bristles, often called chaetae or setae, <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> defend the animals and may act as sensors. In some brachiopods groups of chaetae help to channel the flow of water into and out of the mantle cavity.|$|E
5|$|Stuttering (alalia syllabaris), {{also known}} as {{stammering}} (alalia literalis or anarthria literalis), is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases, and involuntary silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The exact etiology of stuttering is unknown; both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech-language pathology techniques available <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> increase fluency in some stutterers {{to the point where}} an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present.|$|E

25|$|Restless leg {{syndrome}} may resolve if {{the underlying}} problem is addressed. Otherwise treatment includes lifestyle changes and medication. Lifestyle changes <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> include stopping alcohol and tobacco use, and sleep hygiene. Medications used include levodopa or a dopamine agonist such as pramipexole. RLS affects an estimated 2.5â€“15% of the American population. Females are more commonly affected than males and it becomes more common with age.|$|E

25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of tinnitus is usually {{based on the}} person's description. A number of questionnaires exist <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> to assess how much tinnitus is interfering with a person's life. The diagnosis is commonly supported by an audiogram and a neurological examination. If certain problems are found, medical imaging, such as with MRI, may be performed. Other tests are suitable when tinnitus occurs with the same rhythm as the heartbeat. Rarely, the sound may be heard by someone else using a stethoscope, in which case it is known as objective tinnitus. Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions, which are sounds produced normally by the inner ear, may also occasionally result in tinnitus.|$|E
25|$|Some {{birds are}} {{excellent}} vocal mimics. In some tropical species, mimics {{such as the}} drongos may {{have a role in}} the formation of mixed-species foraging flocks. Vocal mimicry can include conspecifics, other species or even man-made sounds. Many hypotheses have been made on the functions of vocal mimicry including suggestions that they may be involved in sexual selection by acting as an indicator of fitness, help brood parasites, or protect against predation, but strong support is lacking for any function. Many birds, especially those that nest in cavities, are known to produce a snakelike hissing sound <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> deter predators at close range.|$|E

25|$|When {{patients}} are taking multiple medications, the discontinuation of drugs suspected of causing myoclonus {{and treatment of}} metabolic derangements may resolve some cases of myoclonus. When pharmacological treatment is indicated anticonvulsants are the main line of treatment. Paradoxical reactions to treatment are notable. Drugs which most people respond to may in other individuals worsen their symptoms. Sometimes {{this leads to the}} mistake of increasing the dose, rather than decreasing or stopping the drug. Treatment of myoclonus focuses on medications <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> reduce symptoms. Drugs used include sodium valproate, clonazepam, the anticonvulsant levetiracetam, and piracetam. Dosages of clonazepam usually are increased gradually until the patient improves or side effects become harmful. Drowsiness and loss of coordination are common side effects. The beneficial effects of clonazepam may diminish over time if the patient develops a tolerance to the drug.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 Maine, At Chantley's Lobster House, {{the last}} {{location}} where both baby Emma and Pinocchio arrived in 1983, an adult Emma {{has begun a}} quest to find her birth family, and joined by a bondswoman named Cleo Fox, who has been tracking her down since Emma robbed a few convenience stores. Over time, both Cleo and Emma bond, and helps Emma gain access to records <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> her, but come up empty handed. When they arrived in Phoenix, Emma attempts to escape as she is wanted for robberies there only to have Cleo talk her out of it. When they stop at a government record office, Emma breaks in to get information but Cleo helps her escape by breaking a window and jumping out but ends up with a shard of glass cut into her stomach. As Emma helps a dying Cleo, she tells Emma the only family member she has left is her daughter that she gave up a ten years ago. Cleo then dies after telling Emma to run away.|$|E
25|$|Some clinicians {{suggest that}} {{assessment}} of the construct of psychopathy does not necessarily add value to violence risk assessment. A large systematic review and meta-regression found that the PCL performed the poorest out of nine tools for predicting violence. In addition, studies conducted by the authors or translators of violence prediction measures, including the PCL, show on average more positive results than those conducted by more independent investigators. There are several other risk assessment instruments which can predict further crime with an accuracy similar to the PCL-R {{and some of these}} are considerably easier, quicker, and less expensive to administer. This may even be done automatically by a computer simply based on data such as age, gender, number of previous convictions and age of first conviction. Some of these assessments may also identify treatment change and goals, identify quick changes <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> short-term management, identify more specific kinds of violence that may be at risk, and may have established specific probabilities of offending for specific scores. Nonetheless, the PCL-R may continue to be popular for risk assessment because of its pioneering role and the large amount of research done using it.|$|E

25|$|Geometric matching/ shape {{complementarity}} methods {{describe the}} protein and ligand {{as a set}} of features that make them dockable. These features may include molecular surface / complementary surface descriptors. In this case, the receptorâ€™s molecular surface is described in terms of its solvent-accessible surface area and the ligandâ€™s molecular surface is described in terms of its matching surface description. The complementarity between the two surfaces amounts to the shape matching description <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> finding the complementary pose of docking the target and the ligand molecules. Another approach is to describe the hydrophobic features of the protein using turns in the main-chain atoms. Yet another approach is to use a Fourier shape descriptor technique. Whereas the shape complementarity based approaches are typically fast and robust, they cannot usually model the movements or dynamic changes in the ligand/ protein conformations accurately, although recent developments allow these methods to investigate ligand flexibility. Shape complementarity methods can quickly scan through several thousand ligands {{in a matter of seconds}} and actually figure out whether they can bind at the proteinâ€™s active site, and are usually scalable to even protein-protein interactions. They are also much more amenable to pharmacophore based approaches, since they use geometric descriptions of the ligands to find optimal binding.|$|E
500|$|Treatments <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> with {{symptoms}} include simple pain medication and medications for fevers such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol). It, however, {{is not clear}} if acetaminophen helps {{with symptoms}}. [...] It is not known if over the counter cough medications are effective for treating an acute cough. Cough medicines are not recommended for use in children {{due to a lack}} of evidence supporting effectiveness and the potential for harm. In 2009, Canada restricted the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medication in children six years and under due to concerns regarding risks and unproven benefits. The misuse of dextromethorphan (an over-the-counter cough medicine) has led to its ban in a number of countries. Intranasal corticosteroids have not been found to be useful.|$|E
