While {{traveling}} {{down a long}} corridor, the dragon surrounds Keil in a force field, lifting him from the saddle and suspending him in the hallway. Keil watches as the dragon continues on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> the tower, then a blinding light is seen and the tower explodes. Keil wakes up some time later in a desert area abutting the ocean. Looking down, he sees the foot prints of the blue dragon around him, indicating that after the explosion, the dragon carried him to safety and flew away.|$|E
5|$|While {{several new}} {{buildings}} have been planned, {{many of the}} changes that had been proposed to the Ghetto in the previous master plan are no longer included in the new plan. The largest feature affecting the student neighborhoods is a new building to the east of Alberta Street, between Chambers Street and Obell Court, on the Darkside. According to the draft of the master plan, the building is intended to be a sustainable residence hall, a 75- to 90-bed facility that would also include an educational wing. The proposed building would use technologies such as solar energy, geothermal heating and cooling, compost piles and low-flow showers. The plan also calls for a walk/bike greenway to link the neighborhood <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> campus and the athletic complex.|$|E
5|$|On the moon, {{the party}} meets the sage Fusoya, who {{explains}} that Cecil's {{father was a}} Lunarian. Fusoya also explains that a Lunarian named Zemus plans to destroy life on the Blue Planet so that the Lunarians can take over, using Golbez to summon the Giant of Babil, a colossal robot. The party returns to Earth and {{the forces of the}} two worlds attack the Giant, including Palom and Porom, who have been revived. After the party breaks the robot, Golbez and Kain confront them, only to have Fusoya break Zemus' control over Golbez, in turn releasing Kain. Cecil learns that Golbez is his older brother. Golbez and Fusoya head <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> the moon to defeat Zemus, and Cecil's party follows. In the moon's core, the party witnesses Golbez and Fusoya kill Zemus, but then quickly fall to his resurrected form, the spirit Zeromus, the embodiment of all of Zemus' hatred and rage. Back on Earth, the Elder of Mysidia commands all of Cecil's allies and friends to pray for the party, which gives Cecil and his allies the strength to fight and slay Zeromus. Following the battle, Fusoya and Golbez opt to leave Earth with the moon. Cecil, at last accepting the truth, acknowledges Golbez as his brother, and bids him farewell.|$|E

25|$|The first open {{opposition}} to Malcolm came in November 1153, from family rivals, {{the sons of}} Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair. They mounted their challenge {{with the aid of}} a neighbour, Somerled of Argyll. This threat soon dissipated, because Somerled was beset with more pressing concerns: his war with Guðrøðr Óláfsson, King of the Isles lasted until 1156 and a possible conflict with Gille Críst, Mormaer of Menteith, over Cowal, loomed large. Support for the sons of Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair may also have come from areas closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> the kingdom; two conspirators are named by chroniclers, one of whom died in trial by combat in February 1154.|$|E

25|$|As a {{young man}} the Utrecht-born artist Hendrick de Keyser was apprenticed to master Cornelis Bloemaert the elder. At the age of 26 he {{followed}} Bloemaert to Amsterdam. Soon he set to work as an independent artist. When his talent became generally appreciated he was appointed city stonemason and sculptor. In fact his duties included all of the tasks now associated with the job of city architect. De Keyser is famous {{for a number of}} important buildings which belong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> Dutch historic sites. Today the Zuiderkerk (1603-1611) and accompanying tower (1614), the Delft Town Hall (1618-1620), the Westerkerk (1620-1631) and Westertoren (built in 1638 but in a modified version) are among the historic buildings which provide important insights into De Keyser’s work. His Commodity Exchange of 1608-1613 was pulled down in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Several {{researchers}} {{proposed a}} solution to these problems by introducing space into the initial model either explicitly or {{in the form of}} a spatial segregation within compartments. Bresch et al. proposed a package model as a solution for the parasite problem. Later on, Szathmáry and Demeter proposed a stochastic corrector machine model. Both compartmentalized systems proved to be robust against parasites. However, package models do not solve the error threshold problem that originally motivated the idea of the hypercycle. A few years later, Maarten Boerlijst and Paulien Hogeweg, and later Nobuto Takeuchi, studied the replicator equations with the use of partial differential equations and cellular automata models, methods that already proved to be successful in other applications. They demonstrated that spatial self-structuring of the system completely solves the problem of global extinction for large systems and, partially, the problem of parasites. The latter was also analysed by Robert May, who noticed that an emergent rotating spiral wave pattern, which was observed during computational simulations performed on cellular automata, proved to be stable and able to survive the invasion of parasites if they appear at some distance from the wave core. Unfortunately, in this case, rotation decelerates as the number of hypercycle members increases, meaning that selection tends toward decreasing the amount of information stored in the hypercycle. Moreover, there is also a problem with adding new information into the system. In order to be preserved, the new information has to appear near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> the spiral wave. However, this would make the system vulnerable to parasites, and, as a consequence, the hypercycle would not be stable. Therefore, stable spiral waves are characterized by once-for-ever selection, which creates the restrictions that, on the one hand, once the information is added to the system, it cannot be easily abandoned; and on the other hand, new information cannot be added.|$|E

Phra Candasaro devoted {{the rest of his life}} to teaching and furthering the depth of knowledge of Dhammakaya meditation, a meditation method which he also called [...] "Vijja Dhammakaya", 'the direct knowledge of the Dhammakaya'. Temples in the tradition of Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen, together called the Dhammakaya Movement, believe that this method was the method the Buddha originally used to attain Enlightenment, but was lost five hundred years after the Buddha passed away. The event of the attainment of the Dhammakaya is usually described by the Dhammakaya movement in miraculous and cosmic terms. For example, it is mentioned that heavy rains preceded the event.|$|E

500|$|Structure and agency, {{sometimes}} referred to as determinism versus voluntarism, form an enduring ontological debate in social theory: [...] "Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency?" [...] In this context 'agency' refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices, whereas 'structure' relates to factors that limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, and so on). Discussions over the primacy of either structure and agency relate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> sociological epistemology ("What is the social world made of?", [...] "What is a cause in the social world, and what is an effect?"). A perennial question within this debate is that of [...] "social reproduction": how are structures (specifically, structures producing inequality) reproduced through the choices of individuals? ...|$|E

500|$|Highway 61 Revisited has {{remained}} {{among the most}} highly acclaimed of Dylan's works.

[...] Michael Gray calls Highway 61 [...] "revolutionary and stunning, not just for its energy and panache but in its vision: fusing radical, electrical music... with lyrics that were light years ahead of anyone else's; Dylan here unites the force of blues-based rock'n'roll {{with the power of}} poetry. The whole rock culture, the whole post-Beatle pop-rock world, and so in an important sense the 1960s started here." [...] In the opinion of PopMatters critic Hank Kalet, the album was the most [...] "electrifying" [...] rock and roll record ever and [...] "one of a handful of albums (including the Beatles' Rubber Soul and Revolver) that gave literate rockers the green light to create a kind of intelligent, probing rock music that had not existed before". [...] "This seminal folk-rock classic" [...] showcased [...] "Dylan's seething, not-quite-out-of-control vocal delivery and a rough-and-tumble instrumental attack", as well as his [...] "transformation from a folk singer to a rock and roller", Sam Sutherland wrote in High Fidelity.|$|E
