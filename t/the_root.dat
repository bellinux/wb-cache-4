5|$|Cementum is a {{specialized}} bone like substance covering <b>the</b> <b>root</b> of a tooth. It is approximately 45% inorganic material (mainly hydroxyapatite), 33% organic material (mainly collagen) and 22% water. Cementum is excreted by cementoblasts within <b>the</b> <b>root</b> of the tooth and is thickest at <b>the</b> <b>root</b> apex. Its coloration is yellowish {{and it is}} softer than dentin and enamel. The principal role of cementum is {{to serve as a}} medium by which the periodontal ligaments can attach to the tooth for stability. At the cementoenamel junction, the cementum is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least ⅔ of <b>the</b> <b>root.</b> The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about ⅓ of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> apex.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} of binary search {{can be analyzed}} by reducing the procedure to a binary comparison tree, where <b>the</b> <b>root</b> node is the middle element of the array. The middle element of the lower half is the left child node of <b>the</b> <b>root</b> and the middle element of the upper half is the right child node of <b>the</b> <b>root.</b> The rest of the tree is built in a similar fashion. This model represents binary search; starting from <b>the</b> <b>root</b> node, {{the left or right}} subtrees are traversed depending on whether the target value is less or more than the node under consideration, representing the successive elimination of elements.|$|E

50|$|In complex analysis, {{a branch}} of mathematics, the Gauss-Lucas theorem gives a {{geometrical}} relation between <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> of a polynomial P and <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> of its derivative P. <b>The</b> set of <b>roots</b> of a real or complex polynomial {{is a set of}} points in the complex plane.

40|$|Plant <b>roots</b> are <b>the</b> most {{important}} part for taking up nutrients and water to <b>the</b> main stems. <b>Roots</b> grow in <b>the</b> path of minor resistance and they extend in the porous spaces of soil. <b>The</b> <b>roots</b> change their directions when they find Peds that are aggregates of resistant soil.

The leaves of the Cartesian tree represent the vertices of the input graph, and the minimax distance between two vertices equals the weight of the Cartesian tree node that is their lowest common ancestor. Once the minimum spanning tree edges have been sorted, this Cartesian tree can be constructed in linear time.|$|E
