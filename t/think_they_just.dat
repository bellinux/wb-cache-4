500|$|A fan of Fringe, Pearl Jam {{musician}} Mike McCready {{talked with}} series composer Chris Tilton about writing some music for [...] "Northwest Passage". McCready said he started [...] "throwing ideas back and forth. And I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> wanted a northwest guy to do it, {{because they were}} shooting it in the northwest". He elaborated that [...] "My role was smaller than someone who wrote all the music for it, but I think I was none the less integral in there. I mean, it was fun. Chris sent me his cues, and I just kind of rearranged them into guitar ideas".|$|E
500|$|During {{her early}} {{appearances}} on the show, Billie Jenkins {{is identified as}} the Charmed Ones' protégée. Cuoco viewed Billie as a [...] "little sister" [...] to the Halliwell sisters, and attributed her as [...] "very naive and always getting in trouble". She described the character's wardrobe as [...] "cute and fun", and felt that it matched her own personal style. When discussing the casting process, Cuoco stated that Billie's initial characterization was based solely on her physical appearance, explained, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> wanted a blonde on the show". Co-executive producer James L. Conway believed Billie's identity as a novice witch added a new dynamic to the show, while Pam Shae called the character [...] "demanding", [...] "spunky", and [...] "very, very confident" [...] despite her inexperience with magic. Keri Blakinger of New York Daily News felt that Billie developed into a [...] "powerful witch in her own right" [...] {{over the course of}} the season.|$|E

[...] I don't think they did it as a stunt to get people back to watching after the strike. I really think that they wanted to develop these two characters, and that you could see a closeness with them way before they ever decided any kind of— I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> have a chemistry together, as actresses, too.

500|$|In 1999, Sony and Capcom greenlit a Resident Evil {{film with}} George A. Romero {{signed on as}} the film's {{director}} and screenplay writer. Romero's association with Capcom, the Resident Evil video game series creators, had extended from 1998 when Romero directed an ad campaign for Biohazard 2 (Resident Evil 2) in Japan. Romero stated in an official appearance in Universal Studios' Talk City chatroom that he had his secretary play the entire game through and record the gameplay so he could study it as a resource. [...] Romero's screenplay {{was based on the}} first Resident Evil game and included characters from the video games. Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine were the lead characters, involved in a romantic relationship. Barry Burton, Rebecca Chambers, Ada Wong, and Albert Wesker were to also appear. [...] The ending to the film would have been {{similar to that of the}} best ending to the first Resident Evil game. Romero's script was disapproved of and production was placed into development hell. Capcom producer Yoshiki Okamoto explained to the editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly that [...] "Romero's script wasn't good, so Romero was fired". [...] In February 2000, Romero revealed in an interview with DGA magazine that [...] "I don't think they were into the spirit of the video game and wanted to make it more of a war movie, something heavier than I thought it should be. So I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> never liked my script." [...] As Romero's script was a close, but not full, adaptation of the game, Capcom believed fans would feel that the film had been altered too much from the game and that newcomers would dislike the premise.|$|E
500|$|She {{explained}} that {{in developing the}} relationship between the two: [...] "we wanted it to be real– not some stunt to get people talking. We wanted {{to see what would happen}} if a woman suddenly had feelings for another woman." [...] The two characters shared a kiss at the end of the season four finale, with which D. Williams of After Ellen noted: [...] "Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television. This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship." [...] Before continuing with the storyline, the show's producers consulted with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation to ensure they maintained realism throughout. Trish Doolan, star of April's Shower was invited to consult in the workshop sessions which took place, and surmised that; [...] "They were really wanting to be truthful to the two characters they're focusing on in the woman-woman relationship", with Nikki Weiss, who also consulted, adding: [...] "they didn't want to stereotype anything either, and write from a place where they didn't understand it.

There ain't a white man in this house, except you and Miss Barbara and me, Major. Jeekie learnt all that in servant's hall palaver. No, not now, other time.

The song featured the lyrics, [...] "I hate the radio but I like Fungus. The only punk-rock station, it's humongous. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> play Misfit's Walk among us.

It’s nothing but a concrete slab. It’s very close if not in an avalanche path. It’s not safe and nobody in the region wants it. End it."

5000|$|On May 16, 2009, ESPN {{baseball}} analyst Peter Gammons {{claimed that}} an unnamed major league player corroborated Merloni's claim.

In no way did I think Boston was trying to push steroids; I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> wanted to educate us on the subject. But you could tell by the faces on the training staff that they didn't think the doctor would say the things he did".|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the New Yorker, von Spakovsky cited two scholars who could substantiate that voter-impersonation fraud was a significant threat: Robert Pastor of American University and Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia. Von Spakovsky said that Pastor had personally experience voter impersonation, but Pastor refuted Von Spakovsky's claim, saying, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> mistakenly checked my name when my son voted—it was just a mistake. I don’t think that voter-impersonation fraud is a serious problem." [...] Both Pastor and Sabato said that they would only support voter ID laws if voter IDs were made free and easily available to all, which is not what Republicans have tried. Sabato also described voter impersonation as [...] "relatively rare today." ...|$|E
5000|$|Stahl {{also said}} [...] "every couple months we'd {{be told that}} they {{accepted}} how we had designed things and it was okay, because {{it was going to}} be a game inspired by the movie. But they were sort of deciding where that line was. At a certain point I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> wanted us to build stuff, and they thought it would all match up and then when it became an issue they sort of accepted the fact that the game was going to be an 'inspired by,' then I think they tried to put other stuff and other scenarios in that weren't going to be in the film. It just sort of became sort of smushed together, and ended up losing momentum." [...] Stahl said another challenge was creating the illusion that the game's levels were larger than they actually were.|$|E

5000|$|Unknown to Marnie, Aggie {{is intent}} on {{training}} Marnie as a witch.

Gwen insists Marnie will be raised as a normal person and not a witch. Aggie says she disagrees, but actually she is there for another reason: people have suddenly started mysteriously disappearing in her hometown. Gwen <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> moved, but Aggie says it is not that simple. Aggie desperately asks for Gwen's help, but Gwen declines. Marnie overhears the argument.|$|R

5000|$|The {{interview}} {{had come}} about after Buscema, at his brother's urging, had first written to Marvel production manager Sol Brodsky to introduce {{himself and his}} work. Brodsky had no assignments {{for him at the}} time, and Buscema [...] "called him a couple of times just to bug him a little bit and let him know that I was still alive, and eventually the first job came through" [...] in June 1968. That job, from Brodsky, was a 10-page Western feature, [...] "Gunhawk". [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> said, 'Sal, here's the plot, go to it,'" [...] Buscema recalled in 2003. That story, [...] "The Coming of Gunhawk", by writer Jerry Siegel and penciler Werner Roth, was eventually published in the omnibus title Western Gunfighters #1 (cover-dated Aug. 1970). Buscema's first published comics work had come before that: inking John Buscema's pencil art on four 39- to 40-page stories in the superhero comic The Silver Surfer #4-7 (Feb.-Aug. 1969); and inking Larry Lieber's pencils on the regular-sized, 20-page Western The Rawhide Kid #68 (Feb. 1969).|$|E
