5|$|The John Dory, {{though of}} uninviting appearance, is {{considered}} by some persons as the most delicious fish that appears at table; in the general estimation, however, it ranks next to the <b>turbot,</b> but it is far less abundant in our waters, and is not commonly to be procured of sufficient size for a handsome dish, except in some few parts of our coast which are celebrated for it. It may easily be known by its yellow gray colour, its one large dark spot on either side, the long filaments on the back, a general thickness of form, and its very ugly head. It is dressed in the same manner, and served usually with the same sauces as a <b>turbot,</b> but requires less time to boil it. The fins should be cut off before it is cooked.|$|E
5|$|Both species eat {{primarily}} squid. The whales make seasonal inshore {{and offshore}} movements {{in response to}} the dispersal of their prey. Fish that are consumed include Atlantic cod, Greenland <b>turbot,</b> Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic herring, hake, and spiny dogfish in the northwest Atlantic. In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, but will also eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting. However, Faroe whales do not seem to feed on cod, herring, or mackerel even when they are abundant.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the capture, growth, {{migration}} and diet of hatchery-released <b>turbots</b> (Psetta maxima) {{were examined in}} the southeastern Black Sea region for six years (2009 - 2014). A total of 9933 <b>turbots</b> were marked with individual serial-numbered T-bar anchor tags and released at Trabzon, Turkey. The mean TL and weight of the released <b>turbots</b> were 12. 91 cm (± 1. 25) and 35. 41 g (± 12. 38) and the same measurements for the captured <b>turbots</b> were 31. 17 ± 0. 86 cm and 878. 08 ± 69. 47 g, respectively. A total of 2. 7 % (270 fishes) of the tagged individuals were captured {{during the study period}} and the age of the captured tagged fishes was between 0 + and 5 + years. Growth of the captured <b>turbots</b> was analytically examined. Movements of the tagged <b>turbots</b> were expressed as “resident” and “migratory”. Three prey groups showed the majority of forage organisms; teleost fishes, crustaceans and mollusks in the stomach of the captured <b>turbots.</b> The hatchery-released <b>turbots</b> might be used for stock enhancement due to their high growth rate and commercial value, and their relatively limited migration range...|$|R

25|$|In {{the second}} division's inaugural season, Valenciennes {{finished}} in 7th place in its group. In the following season, the league table was {{converted into a}} single table and Valenciennes finished in 2nd-place position earning promotion to Division 1 as a result. During this period, the club was notably led by foreign players such as Englishmen Peter O'Dowd and George Gibson and the German-born attackers Édouard Waggi and Ignace Kowalczyk. In the club's first season in Division 1, Valenciennes finished 15th place falling back to Division 2. The club finished equal on points with Red Star Olympique, but due to having less wins and a lesser goal difference, Valenciennes were relegated. After suffering relegation, the club brought in a new president known by the surname of <b>Turbot.</b> Soon after arriving, <b>Turbot</b> released several of the club's international players and brought in the likes of Ernest Libérati to replace them. The transition was a success with the club earning promotion back to Division 1 in 1937. However, Valenciennes stint back in Division 1 {{was the equivalent of}} its first. The club finished in last place in the 1937–38 season and relegated back to Division 2. Due to World War II, Valenciennes reverted to amateur status and spent three of the six seasons in wartime playing amateur league football.|$|E

40|$|The {{eggs and}} larvae of very few marine fishes of this coast have been described.

40|$|Abstract The {{capability}} of <b>turbots</b> to use self-feeders was studied using 3 groups of 100 juveniles. Feeding activity reached a plateau after 20 days. Almost al 1 feeding activity was observed during the photophase, and the acrophase {{was associated with}} dawn. The proportion of nocturnal demands was {{the highest in the}} replicate with the lowest feed efficiency, suggesting that feed waste was mainly occurnng during nocturnal feeding activity. During the last 30 days of the experiment, demands wcre only rewarded during two periods of 2. 5 h. day-'. Feed efficiency was improved and was homogeneous between the three tanks, but the voluntary feed intake was reduced. It is concluded that <b>turbots</b> are able to use self-feeders but they do not adapt quickly, and they are notable to compensatc a reduction of feed access by increasing demand activity during the access period...|$|R

50|$|The flounders and spiny <b>turbots</b> eat smaller fish, {{and have}} {{well-developed}} teeth. They sometimes seek prey in the midwater, {{away from the}} bottom, and show fewer extreme adaptations than other families.

500|$|The {{day before}} the operation, Pine Coffin and his staff began {{to plan for the}} mission. The twentynine Dakotas that were to {{transport}} the battalion would take off from Maison Blanche and follow the coast until they reached the harbour at Bône. The leading Dakota would then turn southeast and fly low over the airfield to ascertain its status. If it was unoccupied the paratroopers would be dropped onto the airfield, but if the Fallschirmjaeger were present then the Dakotas would drop the companies a mile away; there they would form up and launch an attack on the airfield. The planning was completed by 16:30, and at 20:00 the American pilots were briefed on the operation, which was briefly interrupted when a German aircraft flew over the area and dropped a stick of bombs. The aircraft took off at 08:30 the next day and experienced an uneventful flight to the airfield, although two aircraft experienced mechanical problems and ditched into the ocean, causing three casualties. The lead Dakota flew over the airfield, and after observing the airfield to be unoccupied, dropped its paratroopers, followed in succession by the remaining transport aircraft. The drop was reasonably accurate, with a few containers and paratroopers being dropped three miles from the airfield. Thirteen men were injured during the drop, primarily when they landed, and one was killed when he accidentally shot himself with his Sten gun. One officer was knocked unconscious during landing and remained so for the next four days, on occasion being heard to murmur [...] "I'll have a little more of the <b>turbot,</b> waiter!". Unknown to the British force, their drop had been observed by a flight of German Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft, carrying the battalion of Fallschirmjaegers; having seen that the airfield was already occupied, the aircraft turned back towards Tunis. When it had secured the airfield, the battalion came under attack from Stuka divebombers, and was initially defenceless. However, once No.6 Commando had secured Bône a number of Oerlikon antiaircraft guns were salvaged from sunken vessels in the port's harbour and these, in combination with a squadron of Spitfires that arrived on the evening of 11 November, were used to fend off future attacks. [...] The battalion held the airfield in conjunction with No.6 Commando until 15 November, when it withdrew and linked up with 'A' Company and the rest of 1st Parachute Brigade at Maison Blanche.|$|E
