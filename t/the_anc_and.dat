5|$|The Ipsos Pulse of the People survey {{undertaken}} in October and November 2013 {{showed that a}} number of provinces would be closely contested. The ANC will continue to dominate in the Eastern Cape, Limpopo, North West, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and Free State. The DA will keep the Western Cape while control of the Northern Cape and Gauteng will be contested between <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> <b>and</b> DA, with other parties holding the balance of power, so coalitions may be decisive. In Limpopo and North West the EFF could become the official opposition.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{also found}} {{evidence}} that Mandela had been {{an active member of}} the South African Communist Party during the late 1950s and early 1960s, something that was confirmed after his death by both <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> <b>and</b> the SACP, the latter of which claimed that he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee. His membership had been hidden by the ANC, aware that knowledge of Mandela's former SACP involvement might have been detrimental to his attempts to attract support from Western countries. Mandela's view of these Western governments differed from those of Marxist-Leninists, for he did not believe that they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.|$|E
5|$|United Nations Security Council Resolution 161 of 21 February 1961, {{called for}} the {{withdrawal}} of Belgian officers from command positions in <b>the</b> <b>ANC,</b> <b>and</b> the training of new Congolese officers with UN help. The various efforts made by ONUC to retrain the ANC from August 1960 to their effective end in June 1963 are described in Arthur House's book , pages 145-155. By March 1963 however, after the visit of Colonel Michael Greene of the United States Army, and the resulting 'Greene Plan,' the pattern of bilaterally agreed military assistance to various Congolese military components, instead of a single unified effort, was already taking shape.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, Botha {{suffered}} a stroke; although he would retain the state presidency, {{he stepped down}} {{as leader of the}} National Party, to be replaced by F. W. de Klerk. In a surprise move, Botha invited Mandela to a meeting over tea in July 1989, an invitation Mandela considered genial. Botha was replaced as state president by de Klerk six weeks later; the new president believed that apartheid was unsustainable and released a number of ANC prisoners. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, de Klerk called his cabinet together to debate legalising <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> <b>and</b> freeing Mandela. Although some were deeply opposed to his plans, de Klerk met with Mandela in December to discuss the situation, a meeting both men considered friendly, before legalising all formerly banned political parties in February 1990 and announcing Mandela's unconditional release. Shortly thereafter, {{for the first time in}} 20 years, photographs of Mandela were allowed to be published in South Africa.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{evidence from}} a recent national post-election study concerning South Africa's prospects for developing into either a truly competitive multi-party system or the one-party-dominant system characteristic of so many other emerging democracies. Focusing on long-term party identification, the evidence indicates that the African National Congress (ANC) not only commands an overwhelming, but also intense, share of partisan loyalty. The potential sources of fluidity and electoral uncertainty- independent voters and those with weak party loyalties- are not large enough to threaten <b>the</b> <b>ANC's</b> re-election prospects. Surprisingly, the source of <b>the</b> <b>ANC's</b> (<b>and</b> <b>the</b> National Party's) support base is not an explicitly racial or ethnic one. Neverthe-less, {{the prospects for a}} one-party-dominant system are high...|$|R

25|$|Founded on 8 January 1912 by John Langalibalele Dube in Bloemfontein as the South African Native National Congress, {{its primary}} mission was give voting rights to black and mixed race Africans and, from the 1940s, to end Apartheid. The ANC {{originally}} attempted to use nonviolent protests to end apartheid, however, the Sharpeville massacre {{resulted in the}} deaths of 69 black Africans and contributed to deteriorating relations with the South African government. On 8 April 1960, the administration of Charles Robberts Swart, banned <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> <b>and</b> forced the party to leave South Africa. After the ban, the ANC formed the Umkhonto weSizwe (Spear of the Nation) to fight against apartheid utilizing guerrilla warfare and sabotage. On 3 February 1990, State President F. W. de Klerk lifted the ban on <b>the</b> <b>ANC</b> <b>and</b> released Nelson Mandela on 11 February 1990. On 17 March 1992, the apartheid referendum was passed by the voters removing apartheid and allowing the ANC to run in the 1994 election. Since the 1994 election the ANC has performed better than 60% in all general elections, including the most recent 2014 election.|$|E
25|$|He {{felt that}} {{religious}} leaders like himself should stay outside of party politics, citing {{the example of}} Abel Muzorewa in Zimbabwe, Makarios III in Cyprus, and Ruhollah Khomeini in Iran as examples in which such crossovers proved problematic.

25|$|The ANC holds a {{historic}} {{alliance with the}} South African Communist Party (SACP) and Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), known as the Tripartite Alliance.

25|$|The ANC {{represented}} the main {{opposition to the}} government during apartheid and therefore they {{played a major role}} in resolving the conflict through participating in the peacemaking and peace-building processes.
