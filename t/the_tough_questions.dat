Since 1973, there have been 157 death row exonerations. That is approximately one exoneration for every ten executionsin this country. Recent research suggests that the rate of wrongful convictions in capital cases where a death sentence was imposed is approximately four percent, which means that approximately 120 of the roughly 3, 000 inmates on death row in this country are not guilty.

40|$|This chapter {{investigates the}} idea of Asia– Pacific regionalism, a rival to {{the idea of}} pan- Asianism. ‘Asia– Pacific’ and ‘East Asia’ are the two core terms around which {{different}} regional identities are constructed (He 2004). Conceptualised as ‘Asia– Pacific regionalism’ and ‘pan- Asianism’, they offer different ideas of regional order and vary in scope, boundaries and directions (Wesley 2009). In contrast to the geographic idea of the Asia– Pacific, the idea of pan- Asianism is supported by Asian- affinitive cultures with Asian religions and cultures underlining their perceptions of an Asian region. In dealing with the challenge of pan- Asianism, Australia has consistently promoted a version of regionalism which encompasses the Pacific Oceans or the Indo– Pacific Oceans. In other words, Australian engagement with Asia is through the Pacific and/ or Indian Oceans. This approach creates a regional space in which Australia has a comfortable position within the regional imagination. However, this vision of regionalism has the potential to undermine the exclusive nature of Asianism and dilute the identity of Asianism. While the idea of Asia- Pacific regionalism has the advantage of constructing a broader regional identity and consciousness, it does not address <b>the</b> <b>tough</b> <b>question</b> of whether Australia is a part of Asia. On this, Australia is in a culturally awkward position...|$|R
5000|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> <b>question</b> {{was where}} <b>the</b> {{competition}} {{games of the}} Third European Basketball Championship should be played. First European Championship was held in a primitively adapted exhibitions hall, second - in adapted former factory premises. Firstly, there was a thought to organize it in an open-court with a hanging tarpaulin roof, protecting from the rain, in the that time State Court (currently Darius and Girėnas Stadium). Although, such building wasn't suitable nor for the Lithuania, nor for the FIBA. It was decided to build completely new sports hall for the basketball games. Anatolijus Rozenbliumas projected the new basketball hall with capacity of 11.000 people (3.500 seats). It cost around 400.000 LTL, however nobody complained about its necessarily and its building progress. Kaunas Sports Hall was built in time. Many helpers participated in construction. One of them, Donatas Banionis, remembers: [...] "I remember 1939 European Championship in Kaunas. Then the Kaunas Sports Hall was built. On {{the eve of the}} tournament I learned from friends that helpers are required to number the benches. Free observation of the games was promised for that. This, for us - boys, was a staggering thing. The cheapest ticket to all the games cost 10 LTL. So I numbered the sports hall benches with dye honestly".|$|R
