5|$|The {{performance}} of Rebecca {{seems to me}} to have <b>taken</b> <b>us</b> further into the danger area instead of showing any improvement. I am unable to defend at a time when departmental costs and scene loads are in an acute state the load imposed by Rebecca on Design and Supply and the expenditure upon extras and costumes... the vast area of the hall and the stairway never justified the great expenditure of effort required in building and one is left with a very clear impression of reaching a point where the department must be accused of not knowing what it is doing.|$|E
25|$|So there’s no real choice this year, {{but what}} the Occupy {{movement}} has done has <b>taken</b> <b>us</b> back to the era when Martin Luther King was in the Sixties said ‘This is unacceptable!’ We cannot {{have a situation where}} everything is owned by the 1% {{in the same way that}} Martin Luther King said in the Riverside Church that we have a government that is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today, we are exploiting the planet, and that is unacceptable. So the memory of Martin Luther King – it’s about dreams, but it’s also about the courage to draw a line right there and say ‘We cannot go on crossing this line. This is a moral line, this is a line concerning power and the world’. And there today America is on that line. And people know that what we got to – these years after Martin Luther King was murdered – is completely unacceptable, and it’s his example that will inspire us as we go forward into this year.|$|E

I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology, and Tom {{is doing a good job}} following the tradition.|$|E

Writing for the same publication, Andrew Hampp thought that their collaboration was very [...] "surprising" [...] because Martin had been working with a lot of artists, including the Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and Britney Spears; however, [...] "Your Body" [...] was the first song Martin wrote for Aguilera, as Aguilera had previously wanted to differentiate herself from the aforementioned acts. During an interview with the magazine, she commented on the Swedish producer, saying [...] "Max is legendary in the business. He's known about me but we haven't crossed paths...

500|$|Using the new system, results improved. In September 1954 City beat Arsenal to go {{top of the}} league, {{though not}} without {{personal}} cost for Paul, as an elbow from Arsenal's Tommy Lawton resulted {{in the loss of}} four teeth. City could not sustain their title challenge, finishing seventh, but Paul's team enjoyed a successful run in the FA Cup, reaching the final, where they faced Newcastle United. An early goal by Jackie Milburn and an unfortunate injury to Jimmy Meadows on 18 minutes left City playing with 10 men and gave them an uphill task. Paul took the responsibility of changing tactics: [...] "Like certain generals I believe that in dire emergency it is often better to attack. I clapped my hands and yelled [...] "Let's show these Geordies the stuff that's <b>taken</b> <b>us</b> to Wembley"". The performance in the remainder of the first half was improved, resulting in an equalising goal by Bobby Johnstone, but in the second half Newcastle scored twice to win 3–1. Publicly, Paul vowed to take his team to Wembley again, but privately he blamed himself for the defeat, questioning whether he had failed as captain.|$|E

In an interview with Rolling Stone, Aguilera said that the album was a [...] "very multi-layered, very heartfelt record" [...] reflecting different sides of her personality. On Lotus, Aguilera worked with new producers, notably Alex da Kid and Max Martin. Alex da Kid, who first teamed with Aguilera in the song [...] "Castle Walls" [...] from T.I.'s No Mercy (2010), commented about Aguilera's approach [...] in recording Lotus, [...] "She definitely had a strong opinion, but she'll go with the best idea in the room. That's really rare for someone that's had so much success." [...] Speaking about working with Max Martin, Aguilera said, [...] "Max is legendary in the business.

500|$|Early {{traditions and}} stories explain this verse as a miracle {{performed}} by Muhammad, following requests of {{some members of}} the Quraysh. Most Muslim commentators accept the authenticity of those traditions. The following verse 54:2, [...] "But if they see a Sign, they turn away, and say, 'This is (but) transient magic'" [...] is taken in the support of this view. The classical commentator Ibn Kathir provides a list of the early traditions mentioning the incident: A tradition transmitted on the authority of Anas bin Malik states that Muhammad split the moon after the pagan Meccans asked for a miracle. Another tradition from Malik transmitted through other chains of narrations, mentions that the mount Nur was visible between the two parts of the moon (Mount Nur is located in Hijaz. Muslims believe that Muhammad received his first revelations from God in a cave on this mountain, Cave Hira'). A tradition narrated on the authority of Jubayr ibn Mut'im with a single chain of transmission says that the two parts of the moon stood on two mountains. This tradition further states that the Meccan responded by saying [...] "Muhammad has <b>taken</b> <b>us</b> by his magic... If he was able to take us by magic, he {{will not be able to}} do so with all people." [...] Traditions transmitted on the authority of Ibn Abbas briefly mention the incident and do not provide much details.
