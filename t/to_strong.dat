5|$|The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) and Macau's Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau both hoisted {{strong wind}} signal 1 on August1 {{as the system}} was located within 800km (497mi) of their {{respective}} cities. As Prapiroon neared the southern coast of China, the signal was raised <b>to</b> <b>strong</b> wind signal 3 as strong winds were expected to strike the area. In Macau in particular this was further increased <b>to</b> <b>strong</b> wind signal 8 SE on August3, as gale-force winds were expected in the southeastern areas. All signals were cancelled the next afternoon as Prapiroon moved inland.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the numbers}} of dogs killed each year are {{relatively}} low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs. In many cultures, there are strong social and emotional bonds between humans and their dogs {{that can be seen}} as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead <b>to</b> <b>strong</b> emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E
5|$|Divergent {{evolution}} of active site residues is slow, due <b>to</b> <b>strong</b> chemical constraints. Nevertheless, some protease superfamilies have evolved from one nucleophile to another. This {{can be inferred}} when a superfamily (with the same fold) contains families that use different nucleophiles. Such nucleophile switches have occurred several times during evolutionary history, however the mechanisms by which this happen are still unclear.|$|E

5|$|Gliese 876 c is in a 1:2:4 Laplace {{resonance}} {{with the}} outer planets Gliese 876 b and Gliese 876 e: for every orbit of planet e, planet b completes two orbits and planet c completes four. This leads <b>to</b> <b>strong</b> gravitational {{interactions between the}} planets, causing the orbital elements to change rapidly as the orbits precess. This is the second known example of a Laplace resonance, the first being Jupiter's moons Io, Europa and Ganymede.|$|E

5|$|RNA {{interference}} genes, as {{components of}} the antiviral innate immune system in many eukaryotes, are involved in an evolutionary arms race with viral genes.
