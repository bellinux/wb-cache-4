5|$|In April 1972 Van der Byl {{sparked a}} row over <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> which Rhodesia and the United Kingdom {{had made in}} November 1971. Under this agreement, Rhodesia had agreed to certain {{concessions}} to African nationalism {{in return for the}} prospect of recognition of its independence; however, implementation of <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> was to be delayed until the Pearce Commission reported on whether the settlement proposals would be approved by the people of Rhodesia. Van der Byl insisted that Rhodesia would not implement any part of <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> unless Rhodesia's independence was first acknowledged, regardless of the answer from the Pearce Commission. When the Pearce Commission reported that the European, Asian and Coloured (mixed race) populations of Rhodesia were in support but the African population were opposed, <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> was ditched. Many outside and inside Rhodesia had hoped that the government would implement some of <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> even if Pearce reported against it.|$|E
5|$|Leaders of {{the main}} rebel coalition, the Syrian National Coalition, were angered by <b>the</b> <b>agreement.</b> The U.S., without {{consulting}} the coalition, had changed its mind about striking Syria. Rebels furthermore worried <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> might be a considered a de facto admission of the Bashar al-Assad government's legitimacy.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>agreement</b> {{put an end}} to {{hostilities}} {{between the}} JNA and Slovene forces in the Ten-Day War. Slovenia and Croatia agreed to suspend activities stemming from their 25 June declarations of independence for a period of three months. The document also resolved border control and customs inspection issues regarding Slovenia's borders, resolved air-traffic control responsibility and mandated an exchange of prisoners of war. The Brioni Agreement also formed the basis for an observer mission to monitor implementation of <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> in Slovenia. Eleven days after <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> was made, the federal government pulled the JNA out of Slovenia. Conversely, <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> made no mitigating impact on fighting in Croatia.|$|E

50|$|The Swiss {{government}} and parliament approved the accession of Switzerland to <b>the</b> <b>agreements</b> in 2003 but the Swiss People's Party collected 86,000 signatures {{in order to}} force a referendum on <b>the</b> <b>agreements.</b> <b>The</b> government sold <b>the</b> <b>agreements</b> as a security arrangement which {{had nothing to do}} with membership of the European Union.

5|$|Under {{pressure}} from the League of Nations, Poland agreed to negotiate, hoping to buy time and divert attention from the upcoming Żeligowski's Mutiny. The Lithuanians sought to achieve as much protection for Vilnius as possible. <b>The</b> <b>agreement</b> resulted in a ceasefire and established a demarcation line running through the disputed Suwałki Region up to the Bastuny railway station. The line was incomplete and did not provide adequate protection to Vilnius. Although neither Vilnius or the surrounding region was explicitly addressed in <b>the</b> <b>agreement,</b> numerous historians have described <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> as allotting Vilnius to Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{international}} pressure on Croatia {{to end the}} siege of the JNA garrison in Zagreb, Croatian authorities and the JNA signed an agreement on 22 November to evacuate all remaining JNA forces from Croatia. <b>The</b> <b>agreement</b> was signed in Zagreb, by HV Colonel Imra Agotić and Lieutenant Colonel General Andrija Rašeta in presence of the ECMM monitors. <b>The</b> <b>agreement</b> was confirmed {{the next day in}} Geneva when the Geneva Accord was signed by Tuđman, Milošević and the Yugoslav defence minister, JNA General Veljko Kadijević.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{evaluates the}} implementation of <b>the</b> Framework <b>Agreements</b> on Telework and Work-related Stress in Belgium, Denmark, UK, and Czech Republic and in the banking and local Government sectors within these countries. Further, it evaluates the various factors that explain divergent implementation outcomes in countries and sectors. It develops two benchmarks to assess the efficacy of <b>the</b> <b>Agreements</b> as modes of European social partner ‘soft’ law governance; a benchmark that assesses the procedural implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Agreements,</b> and a benchmark that assess the substantive implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Agreements.</b> A multi-level governance theoretical approach is also adopted. It emerged that ‘effective’ procedural implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Agreements</b> largely occurred in Belgium and Czech Republic, but did not occur {{to the same degree}} in Denmark and UK. It also emerged that the substantive effect of <b>the</b> <b>Agreements</b> was patchy and that the substantive impact of <b>the</b> Telework <b>Agreement</b> was greater than that of <b>the</b> Work-related Stress <b>Agreement.</b> Although structural factors were important in explaining divergent implementation outcomes, it also emerged that it was primarily policy and actor related factors that explained divergent national and sectoral implementation outcomes. The research ends with a rather skeptical evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>Agreements</b> as modes of European social partner ‘soft’ law governance.

40|$|On June 30, 2015, in United States v. Apple, Inc., the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit {{held that}} Apple’s {{agreements}} with five publishing companies violated the Sherman Act. With Apple as a retailer and the publishers as manufacturers, <b>the</b> <b>agreements</b> between <b>the</b> {{two groups were}} vertical. This classification is significant because in 2007 in Leegin Creative Leather Products v. PSKS, Inc., the Supreme Court held that all vertical agreements should be analyzed {{under the rule of}} reason. Rather than looking at the structure of <b>the</b> <b>agreements,</b> however, <b>the</b> Second Circuit focused on the type of market restraint that <b>the</b> <b>agreements</b> imposed. Because <b>the</b> vertical <b>agreements</b> facilitated a horizontal conspiracy to raise and set ebook prices, the court reasoned that <b>the</b> <b>agreements</b> were per se illegal. This Comment argues that the Second Circuit erred in finding that <b>the</b> <b>agreements</b> were per se illegal. By ignoring the rule of reason analysis, the Second Circuit’s holding prevented Apple from demonstrating the procompetitive justifications for its agreements...|$|R
50|$|In September 1996 Ariston Berhad signed three {{agreements}} with CPP's minister Sok An, without Ranariddh's knowledge {{or that of}} other FUNCINPEC ministers. <b>The</b> <b>agreements</b> provided for <b>the</b> leasing of land to Ariston to develop a golf course, holiday resort and an airport in Sihanoukville. These actions angered Ranariddh, who in a February 1997 letter to Ariston's president Chen Lip Keong, declared <b>the</b> <b>agreements</b> null and void. Subsequently, Ariston claimed that they had tried unsuccessfully to contact FUNCINPEC officials, {{with a view to}} getting them to jointly sign <b>the</b> <b>agreements.</b> Hun Sen was offended by Ranariddh's actions, and in April 1997 wrote to Mahathir assuring him of the validity of <b>the</b> <b>agreements.</b>|$|R
5|$|Both Warren and Brown stated {{early in}} the race {{that they would not}} accept {{television}} advertisement assistance from Super PACs and interest groups. On January 23, 2012, both candidates signed <b>the</b> <b>agreement,</b> or People's Pledge. While no outside groups were obligated by <b>the</b> <b>agreement,</b> both candidates agreed to donate a sum equal to 50% of an advertisement run by any groups to a charity of the other candidate's choice. The pledge was broken twice, by Brown supporters. In March the American Petroleum Institute and Coalition of Americans for Political Equality launched ads supporting Brown, and as a result, the Brown campaign agreed to make donations of $1,000 and $34,545, respectively, to the charity of Warren's choice: the Autism Consortium.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain and Daladier {{returned}} to their hotel and informed the Czechoslovaks of <b>the</b> <b>agreement.</b> The two Prime Ministers urged quick acceptance by the Czechoslovaks of <b>the</b> <b>agreement,</b> since the evacuation by the Czechs was to begin the following day. At 12:30pm the Czechoslovak government in Prague objected to the decision but agreed to its terms.|$|E
5|$|D.C. United and {{the city}} signed a final {{construction}} agreement on June 8. <b>The</b> <b>agreement</b> required that the facility seat a minimum of 17,000 people, and established the term of the lease at 30 years for a minimal $1 per year. <b>The</b> <b>agreement</b> also contained a clause governing land: If the cost of land acquisition rose above $150 million, D.C. United was required to reimburse the city 50 percent of the excess (although the club's commitment was capped at $10 million). The club was also barred from playing more than an occasional home game away from the Buzzard Point stadium, prohibiting the team from relocating during the term of the lease. Mayor Bowser then submitted <b>the</b> <b>agreement,</b> as well as land purchase agreements and a revised developer agreement, to the City Council for approval; the council approved the land purchase agreements on June 30, 2015.|$|E

5|$|IMF members {{signed the}} Jamaica Agreement in January 1976, which {{ratified}} {{the end of}} the Bretton Woods system and reoriented the Fund's role in supporting the international monetary system. <b>The</b> <b>agreement</b> officially embraced the flexible exchange rate regimes that emerged after the failure of the Smithsonian Agreement measures. In tandem with floating exchange rates, <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> endorsed central bank interventions aimed at clearing excessive volatility. <b>The</b> <b>agreement</b> retroactively formalized the abandonment of gold as a reserve instrument and the Fund subsequently demonetized its gold reserves, returning gold to members or selling it to provide poorer nations with relief funding. Developing countries and countries not endowed with oil export resources enjoyed greater access to IMF lending programs as a result. The Fund continued assisting nations experiencing balance of payments deficits and currency crises, but began imposing conditionality on its funding that required countries to adopt policies aimed at reducing deficits through spending cuts and tax increases, reducing protective trade barriers, and contractionary monetary policy.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, an American {{company had}} gained a {{concession}} for a railroad between Hankow and Szechuan, but the Chinese revoked <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> in 1904 {{after the company}} (which was indemnified for the revocation) breached <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> by selling a majority stake outside the United States. The Chinese imperial government got {{the money for the}} indemnity from the British Hong Kong government, on condition British subjects would be favored if foreign capital was needed to build the railroad line, and in 1909, a British-led consortium began negotiations. This came to Knox's attention in May of that year, and he demanded that U.S. banks be allowed to participate. Taft appealed personally to the Prince Regent, Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and was successful in gaining U.S. participation, though agreements were not signed until May 1911. However, the Chinese decree authorizing <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> also required the nationalization of local railroad companies in the affected provinces. Inadequate compensation was paid to the shareholders, and these grievances were among those which touched off the Chinese Revolution of 1911.|$|E
