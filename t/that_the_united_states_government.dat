Kentucky's natural resources, manpower, and the L Railroad made both the North and South respect Kentucky's neutrality. President Lincoln and Confederate President Jefferson Davis both maintained hands-off policies when dealing with Kentucky, hoping not to push the state into one camp or the other. From the L depot on Ninth and Broadway in Louisville and the steamboats at Louisville wharfs, supporters of the Confederacy sent uniforms, lead, bacon, coffee and war material south. Although Lincoln {{did not want to}} upset Kentucky's neutrality, on July 10, 1861, a federal judge in Louisville ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>government</b> had the right to stop shipments of goods from going south over the L railroad.|$|E
