25|$|TK1 is {{synthesized}} by {{the cell}} during the S phase of cell division. After cell division is completed, TK1 is degraded intracellularly {{and does not}} pass to body fluids after normal cell division. There is a feed-back regulation of the action of thymidine kinase in the cell: thymidine triphosphate (TTP), {{the product of the}} further phosphorylation of thymidine, acts as an inhibitor to thymidine kinase. This serves to maintain a balanced amount of TTP available for nucleic acid synthesis, not oversaturating the system. 5'-Aminothymidine, a non-toxic <b>analogue</b> of <b>thymidine,</b> interferes with this regulatory mechanism and thereby increases the cytotoxicity of <b>thymidine</b> <b>analogues</b> used as antineoplastic drugs. The reaction kinetics of <b>thymidine</b> and <b>thymidine</b> <b>analogues</b> phosphorylation is complicated and only partly known. The overall phosphorylation of thymidine to thymidine triphosphate does not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the various phosphates of thymidine and uridine interfere with the phosphorylation of each other.

50|$|A non-radioactive {{assay method}} has been {{developed}} by the company Dia-Sorin. In this technique 3'-azido-2',3'-deoxythymidine (Zidovudine, AZT) is first phosphorylated to AZT 5'-monophosphate (AZTMP) by TK1 in the sample. AZTMP is measured in an immunoassay with anti-AZTMP antibodies and AZTMP-labeled peroxidase. The assay runs in a closed system on the laboratory robot from DiaSorin. The DiviTum assay from Biovica International uses another <b>thymidine</b> <b>analogue,</b> bromodeoxyuridine, as substrate to the enzyme. The product of the reaction is further phospholylated to tri-phosphate and incorporated in DNA-strings of polythymidine. The polythymidine binds to strings of polyadenine coupled {{to the bottom of}} the wells in microtiter plates. There it is detected with ELISA technique: The wells are filled with a solution of a monoclonal antibody to bromo-deoxyuridine. The monoclonal antibody has been bound (conjugated) to the enzyme alkaline phosphatase. After the unbound antibody with attached alkaline phosphatase has been washed away, a solution of a substrate to the alkaline phosphatase, para-nitrophenylphosphate, is added. The product of the reaction, para-nitrophenol, is yellow at alkaline pH and can be measured by photometry. This method has been evaluated against the previous radioactive technique. It gives a considerably more sensitive determination than the previous methods and is therefore suitable for use with solid tumors that give less elevation of the thymidine kinase in body fluids. Comparisons of the methods have been published. A variation of the technique is using homogeneous ELISA for the measurement. Direct determination of the thymidine kinase protein by immunoassay has also been used. This method does not correlate well with the methods measuring the enzymatic activity. One explanation is that the method also measures protein that is enzymatically inactive and that the degree of inactivation varies for different sources of thymidine kinase in the body.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{validate}} {{the use of}} the <b>thymidine</b> <b>analogues</b> as local perfusion markers in human tumors (no labeling indicates no perfusion) by comparison with the well-characterized perfusion marker Hoechst 33342. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Human tumor xenografts from gliomas and head-and-neck cancers were injected with iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd) or bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) and the fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342. In frozen sections, each blood vessel was scored for the presence of IdUrd/BrdUrd labeling and Hoechst in surrounding cells. The percentage of analogue-negative vessels was compared with the fraction of Hoechst-negative vessels. Collocalization of the two markers was also scored. RESULTS: We found considerable intertumor variation in the fraction of perfused vessels, measured by analogue labeling, both in the human tumor xenografts and in a series of tumor biopsies from head-and-neck cancer patients. There was a significant correlation between the Hoechst-negative and IdUrd/BrdUrd-negative vessels in the xenografts (r = 85, p = 0. 0004), despite some mismatches on a per-vessel basis. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Thymidine</b> <b>analogues</b> can be successfully used to rank tumors according to their fraction of perfused vessels.

The ability to investigate, in detail, the structure, function and the interplay between the two has driven the development of novel approaches for the investigation of these concepts. Fluorescence spectroscopy, a technique that protein chemists have utilized for many years due to the inherent favorable photophysical properties of select naturally occurring amino acids, has gained tremendous interest by nucleic acids scientists in recent decades. The lack of naturally occurring nucleosides with favorable photophysical properties has driven the design and application of novel fluorescent nucleosides. Towards this pursuit, we have described guidelines that {{will enable us to}} systematically identify novel heterocycles with both favorable photophysical and structural properties. Utilizing our design principles, we have explored the idea of conjugating small five membered ring heterocycles, namely furan, thiophene, oxazole and thiazole, to both the pyrimidine and purine nuclei.
