40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} financial restatements on the debt market. Specifically, {{we focus on the}} secondary loan market, which {{has become one of the}} largest capital markets in the US, and ask the following: (1) whether financial restatements increase restating firm’s cost of debt financing and (2) whether the information about restatements arrives at the secondary loan market earlier than at the stock market? Using 176 restatement data, we find significant negative abnormal loan returns and increased bid-ask spreads around restatement announcements. Furthermore, this negative loan market reaction is more pronounced when the restatement is initiated by either the SEC or auditors, and when the primary reason for restatement is related to revenue recognition issues. Additionally, we find restatement information arrives at the secondary loan market earlier than at the equity market, and that such private information quickly flows into the equity market. We also show that stock prices begin to decline approximately 30 days prior to the restatement announcements for firms with <b>traded</b> <b>loans.</b> However, we do not find such informational leakage for firms without <b>traded</b> <b>loans.</b> Collectively, the results of this paper suggest: (1) increased cost of debt financing after restatements and (2) superior informational efficiency of the secondary loan market to the stock market...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I exploit a {{syndicated}} loan market {{to explore the}} impact of information asymmetry on debt pricing and maturity. As a measure of information asymmetry associated with a borrowing firm, I utilize the bid-ask spread on the firm’s loans traded on the secondary loan market. There are two primary findings. First, I find that, ceteris paribus, the interest rate spread on a borrower’s syndicated loan is positively related to the average bid-ask spread on its previous loans traded on the secondary loan market. Second, I show, ceteris paribus, a negative relation between the syndicated loan’s maturity and the average bid-ask spreads on the borrower’s <b>traded</b> <b>loans.</b> This empirical evidence demonstrates that information asymmetry increases the cost of debt capital and reduces the debt maturity...|$|E
40|$|The {{main issue}} is to {{determine}} when {{and under what circumstances}} loans that are traded become debt securities. This is an important issue because virtually all loans are potentially tradable and trading has increased. Classifying <b>traded</b> <b>loans</b> as securities also has consequences for valuation as positions on debt securities are valued at market prices and those on loans at nominal values. BOPTEG Background Paper for Issues # 12 / 13 reviews existing statistical standards and discusses some possible options. BOPTEG Issues Paper # 12 deals with a related issue of the classification of securities between portfolio investment and other investment within the functional classification of financial assets/liabilities. 1. Current international standards The 1993 SNA (para. 11. 75) states that “Loans which have become negotiable de facto should also be classified under securities other than shares”. MFSM 2000 uses the same sentence (para. 134). ESA 95 (para. 5. 79) mentions that “Secondary trade in loans exists. However, individual loans are only traded incidentally. In cases where a loan becomes negotiable on an organized market, it is to classify in the category securities other than shares”. Para. 5. 62. j explains that “loans that hav...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the {{secondary}} loan market has developed into an over-the-counter market where loans {{are not only}} sold but also subsequently traded. This shift away from traditional banking is altering the business of lending. Loan sales are valuable to banks because they free up capital, generate fee-based income and facilitate risk management; {{but they may be}} costly to borrowers because they negatively affect bank monitoring incentives. In this paper, however, we argue that there is another potential benefit to borrowers from loan sales. Borrowers with <b>trading</b> <b>loans,</b> in particular those with liquid loans, may "demand" a share of bank benefits from loan sales when they take out new loans as it will be easier for banks to sell these loans afterwards. We investigate this potential benefit of {{the secondary}} loan market by comparing the interest rates borrowers pay before their <b>loans</b> start to <b>trade</b> with the interest rates they pay on loans originated post-trading. Our results show that, on average, borrowers pay higher spreads on the loans they take out after the onset of <b>trading</b> on their <b>loans.</b> Importantly, our results also show that borrowers with liquid <b>trading</b> <b>loans</b> are able to borrow at lower interest rates after the onset of <b>trading</b> on their <b>loans.</b> Thus, while the banks' decision to sell loans may initially impose a cost on borrowers, those whose loans enter the secondary loan market and become liquid benefit from an interest rate discount on their subsequent loans.

Three different policies, Loan Deficiency Payments (LDP), transportation costs and export taxes are considered in the analysis. The results indicate that Brazil benefits from a reduction in transportation costs and becomes more competitive in the global soybean market. Brazilian exports of soybeans increase due to relatively lower export prices. However, Brazil gains little improvement in the export competitiveness of the soybean joint products, soybean meal and oil. A lower U. S. LDP rate results {{in the loss of}} competitiveness for the United States in the world soybean market. Furthermore, the results show that an Argentine export tax reduction increases soybean exports from Argentina, but it reduces the global supply of soybean meal and soybean oil.

40|$|Studies {{of trading}} firm finance {{focus on the}} various credit {{instruments}} used by general trading companies and uncover new knowledge {{about the relationship between}} trade credit (i. e. inter-company credit) and loans (i. e. credit from financial institutions). Theories concerning trade credit granted by industrial firms and loans by financial institutions are broadly divided into those that focus on the differences between the key players, i. e. businesses and financial institutions, and those that focus on the differences between methods, i. e. <b>trade</b> credit and <b>loans.</b> However, empirical studies such as that conducted by Petersen and Rajan (1997) do not necessarily validate theories based on differences in either credit players or credit methods.

5000|$|Banks’ asset {{categories}} are mostly {{made up of}} loans and leases, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, and <b>trading</b> assets. <b>Loans</b> and leases comprise {{the biggest and most}} important category for most banks.

Ultimately, most of the assets held by financial institutions were either not subject to fair value, or did not impact the income statement or balance sheet accounts. [...] However, a large minority of the assets were “held-for-sale” or <b>trading</b> assets. The <b>loans</b> and securities in the held-for-sale classification are tested for impairment and, if impaired, written down to the present value of future cash flows.

In the political area author is investigating the changes in international relations in connection with advent of Ronald W. Reagan and Mikhail S.

In the eighties the core of relations had been shifted into the economic sphere and <b>trade,</b> <b>loans</b> and investment units which were often discussed and also were sources of disputes.
