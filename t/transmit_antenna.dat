25|$|Spatial {{multiplexing}} requires MIMO antenna configuration. In spatial multiplexing, a high-rate {{signal is}} split into multiple lower-rate streams and each stream {{is transmitted from}} a different <b>transmit</b> <b>antenna</b> in the same frequency channel. If these signals arrive at the receiver antenna array with sufficiently different spatial signatures and the receiver has accurate CSI, it can separate these streams into (almost) parallel channels. Spatial multiplexing {{is a very powerful}} technique for increasing channel capacity at higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The maximum number of spatial streams is limited by the lesser of the number of antennas at the transmitter or receiver. Spatial multiplexing can be used without CSI at the transmitter, but can be combined with precoding if CSI is available. Spatial multiplexing can also be used for simultaneous transmission to multiple receivers, known as space-division multiple access or multi-user MIMO, in which case CSI is required at the transmitter. The scheduling of receivers with different spatial signatures allows good separability.|$|E

30|$|The {{proposed}} L-SM {{scheme is}} a combination of a multi-layered coding scheme and the spatial modulation. The codeword of the multi-layered coding scheme contains a number of layers with the same number of active <b>transmit</b> <b>antennas.</b> A number of phase shifts are inserted in the codeword among the layers and symbols to maximize the diversity and coding gains. When all <b>transmit</b> <b>antennas</b> are active, one codeword is transmitted over one codeword period.

In order to allow for more complex scenarios {{in terms of the number}} of <b>transmit</b> <b>antennas</b> and users supported, CIR-related tap prediction-filtering-based parallel interference cancellation (PIC) -assisted decision-directed channel estimation (DDCE) is investigated. New explicit expressions are derived for the estimator’s mean-square error (MSE), and a new iterative procedure is devised for the offline optimization of the CIR-related tap predictor coefficients. These new expressions are capable of accounting for the estimator’s novel recursive structure. In the context of our performance results, it is demonstrated, for example, that the estimator is capable of supporting L = 16 <b>transmit</b> <b>antennas,</b> when assuming K = 512 subcarriers and K 0 = 64 significant CIR taps, while LS-optimized DDCE would be limited to employing L = 8 <b>transmit</b> <b>antennas.</b> Index Terms—Decision-directed channel estimation (DDCE), multiple <b>transmit</b> <b>antennas,</b> orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), parallel interference cancellation (PIC).

40|$|Abstract — Space-time block codes from square complex {{orthogonal}} designs (SCOD) {{have been}} extensively studied {{and most of}} the existing SCODs contain large number of zeros. The zeros in the designs result in high peak-to-average power ratio and also impose a severe constraint on hardware implementation of the code while turning off some of the <b>transmitting</b> <b>antennas</b> whenever a zero is transmitted. Recently, SCODs with no zero entry have been constructed for 2 a <b>transmit</b> <b>antennas</b> whenever a + 1 is a power of 2. Though there exists codes for 4 and 16 <b>transmit</b> <b>antennas</b> with no zero entry, there is no general method of construction which gives codes for any number of <b>transmit</b> <b>antennas.</b> In this paper, we construct SCODs for any power of 2 number of <b>transmit</b> <b>antennas</b> having all its entries non-zero.
