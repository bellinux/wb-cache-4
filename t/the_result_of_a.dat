5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing electropositive cations and basic anions ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Other ionic compounds are known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. If the compound is <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reaction between a strong acid and a weak base, {{the result is an}} acidic salt. If it is <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reaction between a strong base and a weak acid, the result is a basic salt. If it is <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reaction between a strong acid and a strong base, the result is a neutral salt. Weak acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the conjugate base ion and conjugate acid ion, such as ammonium acetate.|$|E
