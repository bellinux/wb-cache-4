40|$|The book summarises {{the history}} of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to water and {{examines}} its main content and the obligations that derive from this right.

This book discusses whether <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to water is recognised as a derivative right or as an independent right at three levels – universal, regional and domestic - where <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> are acknowledged and enforced. For national law a case study approach has been used with focus on Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Colombia. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to water is examined in a transboundary water context, where the use and management of an international watercourse in one riparian state can directly or indirectly affect <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to water in another riparian state.

40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} on health as a <b>human</b> <b>right.</b> Health {{has been recognized}} as a <b>human</b> <b>right</b> in various international documents and {{every country in the}} world is a part to at least one <b>human</b> <b>right</b> treaty that deals with health related rights. However, it is arguable that <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to health (as part of economic, social and cultural rights) is hardly given the same degree of importance as civil and political rights. The question explored in this thesis is as such: are we moving towards a universal recognition of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to health; and accordingly, what does a right to health really entail under current international law; and how is the development of this <b>human</b> <b>right</b> in light of globalization? The overall aim is to explain the content and meaning of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to health and explore the significance and development of this right. Globalization is used to provide a reality platform to illustrate the daily struggle for <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to health, especially in the context of developing countries. Of particular importance is the conclusion that significant progress has been made in <b>the</b> field of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> and health. However, global health challenges and threats are real and they can seriously endanger the realization of all <b>human</b> <b>rights,</b> not just <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to health...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{provided}} {{a justification for}} <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to <b>the</b> Internet access by using Beitz’s theory of <b>human</b> <b>rights.</b> Contrasting to <b>the</b> naturalistic <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> theory that place the normativity of rights {{on a group of}} basic values that are derived from <b>the</b> universal <b>human</b> nature, <b>the</b> practical concept of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> proposed by Beitz grounds <b>the</b> normativity of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> concept on both the basic interests that are supposed to protect and the political role it is expected to play in current <b>human</b> <b>right</b> practice.
