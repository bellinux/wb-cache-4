40|$|Although a {{large number}} of medical error <b>taxonomies</b> have been published, there is little {{evidence}} to suggest that these <b>taxonomies</b> have been systematically compared. This paper describes a study comparing 26 medical error <b>taxonomies</b> using a human factors perspective. The <b>taxonomies</b> were examined to determine if they classified systemic factors of medical errors and if they utilized theoretical error concepts in their classifications. Scope of classification was also examined. It was found that two-thirds of the <b>taxonomies</b> classified systemic factors of medical errors and only a third utilized theoretical error concepts. Medical error <b>taxonomies</b> based on theoretical error concepts {{were more likely to be}} generic in applicability and also more likely to classify systemic factors and psychological error mechanisms of medical errors.

40|$|Taxonomically {{organized}} data pervade science, {{business and}} everyday life. Unfortunately, <b>taxonomies</b> are often under-specified, limiting their utility in contexts such as data inte-gration, information navigation and autonomous agent com-munication. This work formalizes <b>taxonomies</b> and relation-ships between them as formulas in logic. This formalization concretizes notions such as consistency and inconsistency of <b>taxonomies</b> and articulations (inter-taxonomic relations) between them, enables the derivation of new articulations {{based on a}} given set of <b>taxonomies</b> and articulations and provides a framework for testing assumptions about under-specified <b>taxonomies.</b> Given the typical intractability of reasoning with tax-onomies and articulations, this research investigates many optimizations: from those that reduce the search space, to those that leverage parallel processing, to those investigat-ing logics more tractable than first-order logic (e. g., monadic first-order logic, propositional logic, description logics, and subsets of the RCC- 5 spatial algebra). Finally, in addition to reasoning with <b>taxonomies</b> and articulations, this research investigates how to repair inconsistent <b>taxonomies</b> and ar-ticulations, how to explain inconsistencies and discovered relations, and how to merge <b>taxonomies</b> given articulations. Critical to this research {{is the development of}} a framework for testing logics and support for the development of tax-onomies and articulations.

5|$|Recent {{concerns}} {{have focused on}} international communication on cultivated plant <b>taxonomy,</b> organisation of international symposia, and general communication on topics of interest. In 1988 a Horticultural <b>Taxonomy</b> Group (Hortax) was formed in the UK and a parallel organisation, the Nomenclature and Registration Working Group of the Vaste Keurings Commissie in the Netherlands. One development promoting discussion was the newsletter Hortax News which was superseded in February 2006 by {{the first issue of}} Hanburyana, a journal produced by the Royal Horticultural Society in London and dedicated to horticultural <b>taxonomy.</b> This filled a gap left when the American journal Baileya ceased publication in the early 1990s.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Taxonomies</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} numerous times in the literature in order to encode semantic relationships between classes. Such <b>taxonomies</b> {{have been used to}} improve classification results by increasing the statistical efficiency of learning, as similarities between classes can be used {{to increase the amount of}} relevant data during training. In this paper, we show how data-derived <b>taxonomies</b> may be used in a structured prediction framework, and compare the performance of learned and semantically constructed <b>taxonomies.</b> Structured prediction in this case is multi-class categorization with the assumption that categories are taxonomically related. We make three main contributions: (i) We prove the equivalence between tree-structured covariance matrices and taxonomies; (ii) We use this covariance representation to develop a highly computationally efficient optimization algorithm for structured prediction with taxonomies; (iii) We show that the <b>taxonomies</b> learned from data using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) often perform better than imputed semantic <b>taxonomies.</b> Source code of this implementation, as well as machine readable learned <b>taxonomies</b> are available for download fro...|$|R
40|$|<b>Taxonomies</b> play an {{increasingly}} important role in knowledge management of business best practices, providing a basis by which to index, find and communicate knowledge. However, knowledge continues to evolve over time. As a result, <b>taxonomies</b> must also continue to evolve as organizations innovate and change. Reportedly, firms customize best-practice <b>taxonomies</b> to meet their unique organization needs. Accordingly, we might expect organizations to generate dissimilar best-practice <b>taxonomies.</b> However, <b>taxonomies</b> must also reflect the state of knowledge in the area being categorized, and thus {{are likely to be}} similar in many ways in different organizations. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to study how <b>taxonomies</b> change in different organizations and how they stay the same. In order to explain the parallels in organizational <b>taxonomies,</b> the notion of ‘knowledge artefact efficiency’ (or knowledge efficiency) is suggested to capture the concept that new knowledge is rapidly adopted by many organizations in their knowledge management systems.

40|$|Mining {{generalized}} association rules among {{items in}} the presence of <b>taxonomies</b> has been recognized as an important model for data mining. Earlier work on mining generalized association rules, however, required the <b>taxonomies</b> to be static, ignoring the fact that the <b>taxonomies</b> of items cannot necessarily be kept unchanged. For instance, some items may be reclassified from one hierarchy tree to another for more suitable classification, abandoned from the <b>taxonomies</b> if they will no longer be produced, or added into the <b>taxonomies</b> as new items. Additionally, the analysts might have to dynamically adjust the <b>taxonomies</b> from different viewpoints so as to discover more informative rules. Under these circumstances, effectively updating the discovered generalized association rules is a crucial task. In this paper, we examine this problem and propose two novel algorithms, called Diff_ET and Diff_ET 2, to update the discovered frequent itemsets. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed algorithms are very effective and have good linear scale-up characteristics. 2 Keywords: Data mining, generalized association rules, frequent itemsets, evolving <b>taxonomies.</b> 1...|$|R

A limit of this language {{is that it does}} not incorporate negations, thus the union of <b>taxonomies</b> is never inconsistent, though it is meaningful to consider that their merging does not coincide with their union. Thus, a way to extend the taxonomies' language is presented to allow the definition of a merging operator. This operator is algorithmically simple for the part of their contents on which the <b>taxonomies</b> agree, confining complexity to the part on which they do not. So it allows a low time and space complexity merging on similar <b>taxonomies...</b>|$|R

5|$|Systematic botany {{is part of}} {{systematic}} biology, which {{is concerned with the}} range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as determined by their evolutionary history. It involves, or is related to, biological classification, scientific <b>taxonomy</b> and phylogenetics. Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species. Biological classification is a form of scientific <b>taxonomy.</b> Modern <b>taxonomy</b> is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common descent – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called Linnaean <b>taxonomy.</b> It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and administered by the International Botanical Congress.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{the work}} on {{albatross}} genera, Robertson and Nunn went on in 1998 to propose a revised <b>taxonomy</b> with 24 different species, compared to the 14 then accepted. This expanded <b>taxonomy</b> elevated many established subspecies to full species, but was criticised for not using, in every case, peer reviewed information to justify the splits.
