5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E

25|$|The first {{match of}} the event was a Two-Ring King of the Hill Battle Royal. The match {{consisted}} of two rings. The rules were that once a competitor was tossed {{out of the first}} ring, he would battle in the second ring. The last competitor standing in the first ring would be the winner of the first ring and the eliminated participants would compete in the second ring. The last competitor of the second ring would compete against the winner of the first ring in a standard wrestling match. The participants of the match were Eddie Gilbert, Terry Gordy, Scott Hall, Bill Irwin, Brian Pillman, Ranger Ross, Mike Rotunda, Ron Simmons, Rick Steiner, Scott Steiner, Steve Williams, Kevin Sullivan, Sid Vicious and Dan Spivey. Ross and Simmons were the first two participants to be tossed out of the first ring and battle each other in the second ring. All <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> the exception of Pillman and Vicious were tossed out of the first ring and battled in the second ring. Pillman and Vicious fought against each other in the first ring, with Sid eventually eliminating Pillman by avoiding a Diving Crossbody and tossing him over the top rope. As a result, Sid won the Battle Royal of the first ring. The action continued in the second ring as Williams eliminated Irwin and Rotunda and Spivey eliminated Pillman by double-teaming him. Williams delivered a Powerslam to Rotunda and eliminated him. He battled Spivey until Rotunda distracted Williams. This allowed Spivey to deliver a Clothesline to Williams and eliminate him to win the Battle Royal in the second ring. This set up a match between Vicious and Spivey but their manager Teddy Long announced that the two would split the reward of $50,000.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} match that aired, Raw's Edge, Randy Orton, and Jeff Hardy Smackdown!'s King Booker (with Queen Sharmell), Mr. Kennedy, Matt Hardy and Dave Finlay and ECW's CM Punk {{competed in the}} third annual Money in the Bank ladder match. The match {{featured}} many notable spots, including points where Edge performed the Spear on all the other opponents, followed by Randy Orton doing the same by leveling many of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> his RKO later in the match. Mr. Kennedy missed a Kenton Bomb and landed on a ladder {{on the back of}} his neck. He instead received a Swanton Bomb from Jeff Hardy. Several dangerous ladder spots were also featured, including Orton performing an RKO on CM Punk whilst standing on the ladder, and King Booker performing his Book End to Orton from the top of the ladder as well. Midway through the match, Jeff Hardy climbed a fifteen-foot-high ladder inside the ring and on his brother, Matt Hardy's urging, he performed a leg drop off of that ladder onto Edge, who was lying prone on another ladder outside the ring, set-up on the ring apron and the barricade. Due to the impact, the ladder on which Edge was placed, broke in half and he, along with Jeff, were severely injured. They were carried off on stretchers by the paramedics. Later, when Booker was about to retrieve the contract briefcase, Matt Hardy held Booker's wife, Queen Sharmell as a hostage, threatening to perform his Twist of Fate on her. Booker went to her aid and received the Twist of Fate from Matt. Finlay fought Matt for sometime in the ring, and also performed his Celtic Cross to Matt onto a ladder. Finlay's associate Hornswoggle emerged from under the ring and attempted to retrieve the briefcase for Finlay. He was stopped by Kennedy, who performed his Green Bay Plunge on Hornswoggle. Kennedy went on to win the match, only after knocking CM Punk off a ladder by hitting him with another ladder.|$|E
2500|$|The A-Team is a {{naturally}} episodic show, with few overarching stories, except the characters' continuing motivation to clear their names, with few references to events in past episodes and a recognizable and steady episode structure. In describing the ratings drop {{that occurred during}} the show's fourth season, reviewer Gold Burt points to this structure as being a leading cause for the decreased popularity [...] "because the same basic plot had been used over and over again for the past four seasons with the same predictable outcome". Similarly, reporter Adrian Lee called the plots [...] "stunningly simple" [...] in a 2006 article for The Express (UK newspaper), citing such recurring elements [...] "as BA's fear of flying, and outlandish finales when the team fashioned weapons from household items". [...] The show became emblematic of this kind of [...] "fit-for-TV warfare" [...] due to its depiction of high-octane combat scenes, with lethal weapons, wherein <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> (<b>with</b> the notable exception of General Fulbright) are never killed and rarely seriously injured (see also On-screen violence section).|$|E

Persons, {{who are unable to}} control their eye muscles (e. g. in the completely locked-in state) or have severe visual impairments for other reasons, need BCI systems that do not rely on the visual modality. For this reason, BCIs that employ auditory stimuli were suggested. In this study, a multiclass BCI spelling system was implemented that uses animal voices with directional cues to code rows and columns of a letter matrix. To reveal possible training effects with the system, 11 healthy participants performed spelling tasks on two consecutive days. In a second step, the system was tested by a <b>participant</b> <b>with</b> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in two sessions. In the first session, healthy <b>participants</b> spelled <b>with</b> an average accuracy of 76 % (3. 29 bits/min) that increased to 90 % (4. 23 bits/min) on the second day.
