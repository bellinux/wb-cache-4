500|$|Cartwright's normal {{speaking}} {{voice is}} said to have [...] "no obvious traces of Bart". The voice came naturally to Cartwright; prior to The Tracey Ullman Show, she had used elements of it in shows such as My Little Pony, Snorks, and Pound Puppies. Cartwright describes Bart's voice as easy to perform, saying, [...] "Some characters <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more effort, upper respiratory control, whatever it is technically. But Bart is easy to do. I can just slip into that without difficulty." [...] She usually does five or six readings of every line in order to give the producers more to work with. In flashforward episodes, Cartwright still provides the voice of Bart. For [...] "Lisa's Wedding", (season six, 1995) Bart's voice was electronically lowered.|$|E
500|$|On November 16, 2013, it was {{revealed}} that West would be premiering the music video for [...] "Bound 2" [...] on The Ellen DeGeneres Show the following week. The Nick Knight-directed music video was released on November 19, 2013. The video features his then-fiancée Kim Kardashian, topless, riding atop West's motorbike through Monument Valley and other landscapes. Eric Diep of XXL described it as, [...] "a confident display of love and passion with little to no narrative." [...] Spin felt that [...] "a pretty bad idea seen through so completely that it stops being a bad idea". Tom Breihan from Stereogum found the video confusing, saying [...] "it'll <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> to figure out what all's going on there". Lanre Bakare of The Guardian described it as [...] "self-indulgent, idiosyncratic and a bit weird".|$|E
500|$|In 1985 Dylan sang on USA for Africa's famine relief single [...] "We Are the World". He {{also joined}} Artists United Against Apartheid {{providing}} vocals for their single [...] "Sun City". On July 13, 1985, he {{appeared at the}} climax at the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia. Backed by Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, he performed a ragged version of [...] "Hollis Brown", his ballad of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people: [...] "I hope {{that some of the}} money... maybe they can just <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of it, maybe... one or two million, maybe... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks." [...] His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but they did inspire Willie Nelson to organize a series of events, Farm Aid, to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.|$|E

McGuinness would sporadically draw 11 more issues of the series until issue #30 (April 2011). Loeb characterized McGuinness' art style thus: [...] "He <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of Kirby, <b>a</b> taste of Arthur Adams, and then adds his own unique spin and it's awesome." ...|$|R
30|$|In the {{simulation}} results, the packet delivery ratio is improved by 80 - 85 % than AODV when under black hole attack, and 60 % when traffic load increases. The advantage of DPRAODV {{is that it}} achieves an obviously higher packet delivery ratio than the original AODV, except for it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> higher routing overhead and end-to-end delay. But DPRAODV simply detects multiple black holes rather than cooperative black hole attack.|$|R
500|$|Connor Trinneer (who played Commander Trip Tucker), {{felt that}} the finale {{should have had a}} memorable {{farewell}} that he described as a [...] "M*A*S*H moment", but that the producers did not want to focus on such an element. Anthony Montgomery (who played Ensign Travis Mayweather) was similarly displeased with the finale and said [...] "I feel there could have been a more effective way to wrap things up for our show as well as the franchise as a whole. It just seemed to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> away from what the Enterprise cast and crew worked so diligently to achieve over the past four years." [...] While Frakes enjoyed working with Sirtis again, he said that [...] "the reality is {{it was a bit of}} a stretch to have us shut down [...] show," [...] and that in hindsight it was a disservice to them. The early criticism forced the show's producers to hold a conference and address the issue. Braga admitted there was cast unrest, but defended the episode as a way to close not just Enterprise but Star Trek as a whole.|$|E
2500|$|Scott has {{developed}} a method for filming intricate shots as swiftly as possible: [...] "I like working, always, {{with a minimum of}} three cameras. [...] So those 50 set-ups [...] might only be 25 set-ups except I'm covering in the set-up. So you're finished. I mean, if you <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more time to prep on three cameras, or if it's a big stunt, eleven cameras, and– whilst it may take 45 minutes to set up– then when you're ready you say 'Action!', and you do three takes, two takes and is everybody happy? You say, 'Yeah, that's it.' So you move on." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Publishers Weekly article, {{publicist}} Linda Rienecker of New Page Books {{says that}} she sees the film's success {{as part of a}} wider phenomenon, stating [...] "A large part of the population is seeking spiritual connections, and they have the whole world to choose from now". Author Barrie Dolnick adds that [...] "people don't want {{to learn how to do}} one thing. They'll <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of Buddhism, a little bit of veganism, a little bit of astrology... They're coming into the marketplace hungry for direction, but they don't want some person who claims to have all the answers. They want suggestions, not formulas."

5000|$|After {{finishing}} seventh, Kyle Busch locked {{himself into}} the Chase. [...] "We weren’t looking so good after Michigan,’’ Busch said of the 43rd-place finish in the June race. [...] "It was really doom and gloom. I was bumming. I just wasn’t sure what to do. I wasn’t sure what was going on. It <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of that {{time to get the}} rust knocked off, I guess. It’s probably the longest I’ve been out of the race car in my life.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Chris Edwards, for Offshore Echoes, Rosko explained: [...] "I used {{to listen to a}} guy named Roscoe, who used to listen to a guy called Boscoe and the double-syllable name ending in [...] "o" [...] was synonymous with rhythm and rhyme which was a precursor to rap. I also used to listen to several other people like Wolfman, Tom Donahue, etc. So I <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of everybody and became Emperor Rosko to distinguish myself from all the others." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a November 2011 interview, Dan Houser of Rockstar Games {{said that}} {{despite what the}} general public might think, Rockstar likes to [...] "spend a bit of time" [...] {{at the end of}} {{projects}} before deciding what to do next. [...] "Basically we have been meaning to start [...] for a while, but we have limited bandwidth and limited studios, and more games to make than we've started. So suddenly it was a good slot," [...] Houser said, explaining why it took eight years to follow up [...] [...] "Also, contrary to a lot of people, we like to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of time {{at the end of a}} game before starting a sequel, so we can wait for the excitement or disappointment and everything else of the experience to shake down and really see what we should do in the next game." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2011, in an {{interview}} with Gamasutra, Rockstar executive Dan Houser revealed the studio may focus on a sequel for Bully once Max Payne 3 is released.

[...] "So we knew that we didn't want to start doing the Bully sequel instantly at that second with those guys -- even though it is a property that, like Max, we adore and might come back to in the future. There was just no impetus to do that then. So we said, 'You can do Max, and then we will see what we can do with Bully." ...|$|E

5000|$|Concerning Alice's bridesmaid dress, its {{designer}} remains unknown, {{however it}} was presumably designed by Wilkinson. Ashley Greene described the dress as [...] "magical and beautiful" [...] and {{spoke about the}} design process, saying, [...] "We wanted {{to have all the}} bridesmaids fit together and also have their own identity. So, we <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of Alice's past and put it into her dress."

60|$|The cab, {{the lobster}} salad, the frank and good-humoured look of Pendennis, as he smilingly invited the worthy matron, subdued her suspicions and her anger. Since {{he would be}} so obliging, {{she thought she could}} <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of lobster, and so they all marched away to a box; and Costigan called for a waither with such a loud and belligerent voice, as caused one of those {{officials}} instantly to run to him.|$|E
6000|$|In general, {{for this}} reason, a shadow, or, at any rate, {{the part of}} the shadow nearest the object, is darker than {{the dark side of the}} object. I say in general, because a {{thousand}} accidents may interfere to prevent its being so. <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of glass, as a wine-glass, or the ink-bottle, and play it about a little on the side of your hand farthest from the window; you will presently find you are throwing gleams of light all over the dark side of your hand, and in some positions of the glass the reflection from it will annihilate the shadow altogether, and you will see your hand dark on the white paper. Now a stupid painter would represent, for instance, a drinking-glass beside the hand of one of his figures, and because he had been taught by rule that [...] "shadow was darker than the dark side," [...] he would never think of the reflection from the glass, but paint a dark grey under the hand, just as if no glass were there. But a great painter would be sure to think of the true effect, and paint it; and then comes the stupid critic, and wonders why the hand is so light on its dark side.|$|E
6000|$|... § 15. And now, farther, let us <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of the Turnerian tree {{in light}} and shade. I said above I would better {{the drawing of}} that pine trunk, which, though it has {{incipient}} shade, and muscular action, has no texture, nor local color. Now, I take about {{an inch and a}} half of Turner's ash trunks (one of the nearer ones) in this same drawing of Bolton Abbey (fig. 3. Plate 5.), and this I cannot better; this is perfectly finished; it is not possible to add more truth to it on that scale. Texture of bark, anatomy of muscle beneath, reflected lights in recessed hollows, stains of dark moss, and flickering shadows from the foliage above, all are there, as clearly as the human hand can mark them. I place a bit of trunk by Constable (fig. 5.),[41] from another plate in Leslie's Life of him (a dell in Helmingham Park, Suffolk), for the sake of the same comparison in shade that we have above in contour. You see Constable does not know whether he is drawing moss or shadow: those dark touches in the middle are confused in his mind between the dark stains on the trunk and its dark side; there is no anatomy, no cast shadow, nothing but idle sweeps of the brush, vaguely circular. The thing is much darker than Turner's, but it is not, therefore, finished; it is only blackened. And [...] "to blacken" [...] is indeed the proper word for all attempts at finish without knowledge. All true finish is added fact; and Turner's word for finishing a picture was always this significant one, [...] "carry forward." [...] But labor without added knowledge can only blacken or stain a picture, it cannot finish it.|$|E

Lloyd also criticised Nasser Hussain and Andy Caddick; Hussain as poor in his preparation for Test matches, and Caddick as insecure about his cricket.

5000|$|From {{retrospective}} reviews, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{gave the}} album five stars, stating that [...] "the razor-thin production and waves of noise {{mean that it}} <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of effort {{to pick out the}} melodies, but more often the furious noise and melodies fuse together to create an overwhelming sonic force" [...] and that Grant and Mould [...] "both turn in songs that are catchy, clever, and alternately wracked with pain or teeming with humor.
