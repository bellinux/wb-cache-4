5|$|James Charles Taylor (born September 20, 1935) is {{a former}} American {{football}} fullback who played professionally in the National Football League (NFL) for ten seasons, with the Green Bay Packers from 1958 to 1966 and with the expansion New Orleans Saints in 1967. With the Packers, Taylor was invited to five straight Pro Bowls and won four NFL championships, including a victory in Super Bowl I over the Kansas City Chiefs. He was recognized as the NFL Most Valuable Player after winning the rushing title in 1962, the only season in which Jim Brown did not lead the league in rushing yards during his career. An aggressive player and fluent trash <b>talker,</b> Taylor developed several personal rivalries throughout his career, most notably with New York Giants linebacker Sam Huff. This confrontational attitude, combined with his tenacious running style, a penchant for contact, and ability to both withstand and deliver blows, earned him {{a reputation as one}} of the league's toughest players.|$|E

25|$|The exemplar-based {{approaches}} claim listeners {{store information}} for both word- and talker-recognition. According to this theory, particular instances of speech sounds {{are stored in}} the memory of a listener. In the process of speech perception, the remembered instances of e.g. a syllable stored in the listener's memory are compared with the incoming stimulus so that the stimulus can be categorized. Similarly, when recognizing a <b>talker,</b> all the memory traces of utterances produced by that <b>talker</b> are activated and the talker's identity is determined. Supporting this theory are several experiments reported by Johnson that suggest that our signal identification is more accurate when we are familiar with the <b>talker</b> or when we have visual representation of the talker's gender. When the <b>talker</b> is unpredictable or the sex misidentified, the error rate in word-identification is much higher.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} assess whether voices of familiar <b>talkers</b> are simulated while silently reading utterances from those <b>talkers.</b> In addition it was tested, whether talker-contingent simulation of voices in silent reading can occur after familiarization by reading utterances in context. After being familiarized with two <b>talkers</b> by watching video sequences alternatively by reading dialogues featuring those <b>talkers,</b> {{participants were asked to}} rate ambiguous ironic/non-ironic written utterances ascribed to these <b>talkers.</b> Participants rated the ambiguous utterances talker-contingent, i. e. utterances made by <b>talkers</b> who were ironic in study were rated as ironic even in test.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the extent to which}} language familiarity affects the perception of the indexical properties of speech by testing listeners’ identification and discrimination of bilingual <b>talkers</b> across two different languages. In one experiment, listeners were trained to identify bilingual <b>talkers</b> speaking in only one language and were then tested on their ability to identify the same <b>talkers</b> speaking in another language. In the second experiment, listeners discriminated between bilingual <b>talkers</b> across languages in an AX discrimination paradigm. The results of these experiments indicate that there is sufficient language-independent indexical information in speech for listeners to generalize knowledge of talkers’ voices across languages and to successfully discriminate between bilingual <b>talkers</b> regardless of the language they are speaking. However, the results of these studies also revealed that listeners do not solely rely on language-independent information when performing these tasks. Listeners use language-dependent indexical cues to identify <b>talkers</b> who are speaking a familiar language. Moreover, the tendency to perceive two <b>talkers</b> as the “same” or “different” depends on whether the <b>talkers</b> are speaking in the same language. The combined results of these experiments thus suggest that indexical processing relies on both language-dependent and language-independent information in the speech signal...|$|R

Results: Lower lip peak speeds were significantly lower in <b>talkers</b> with mild ALS than in healthy <b>talkers</b> suggesting a lower lip speed constraint in <b>talkers</b> with mild ALS.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was the {{development}} and assessment of a novel method for recording speech produced under varying degrees of articulatory precision in the laboratory. Three conditions were designed to elicit reduced, citation, and careful speaking styles. In the first condition, <b>talkers</b> read sentences while simultaneously carrying out a distractor task. In the second condition, <b>talkers</b> simply read the same set of sentences {{in the absence of any}} other task. In the third condition, <b>talkers</b> read the sentences but were frequently prompted by the computer to re-read the last sentence more carefully. Recordings from six <b>talkers,</b> three female and three male, were made and measurements were carried out along a number of dimensions that have been used in the literature to distinguish careful from reduced speech or that have been linked to differences in intelligibility between <b>talkers.</b> Using acoustic analysis, measures of word duration, sentence duration, overall sentence energy, word energy, sentence energy range, word energy range, pitch range of the sentence, and two measures of F 1 -F 2 vowel space dispersion were obtained for all six <b>talkers.</b> Overall, we observed consistent effects of speaking mode across most <b>talkers</b> for many of the measured dimensions.

25|$|Navajo was an {{attractive}} choice for code use because few {{people outside the}} Navajo had learned to speak the language. Virtually no books in Navajo had been published. Outside of the language, the Navajo spoken code was not very complex by cryptographic standards. It would likely have been broken if a native speaker and trained cryptographers could have worked together effectively. The Japanese {{had an opportunity to}} attempt this when they captured Joe Kieyoomia in the Philippines in 1942 during the Bataan Death March. Kieyoomia, a Navajo sergeant in the U.S. Army, but not a code <b>talker,</b> was ordered to interpret the radio messages later in the war. However, since Kieyoomia had not participated in the code training, the messages made no sense to him. When he reported that he could not understand the messages, his captors tortured him. The Japanese Imperial Army and Navy never cracked the spoken code.|$|E
25|$|An {{epidemic}} of parasites occurs on base forcing Snake to personally kill {{many of his}} own men to contain it. To honor them, he has their cremated remains turned into diamonds to carry into battle. Huey is accused of causing the epidemic while attempting to mutate the parasites to sell as weapons. Alongside suspicion of his role in MSF's destruction, and evidence that he murdered his wife Dr. Strangelove while arguing over using their son in experiments, Snake exiles him from Diamond Dogs. Following this event, Quiet disappears in Afghanistan. Code <b>Talker</b> reveals that Quiet was infected with the English strain parasite {{with the intention of}} joining Diamond Dogs in order to spread it, but her allegiance shifted to Snake and so she remained silent to prevent an outbreak. Huey's mutation of the parasite convinced Quiet that she could not guarantee the safety of Diamond Dogs. Snake finds her and helps her fight fight an onslaught of vehicles. They defeat the wave but as another one approaches they're forced to hide in a sandstorm. She is then forced to speak to summon help when Snake is bitten by a venomous snake. Quiet flees to avoid causing another epidemic.|$|E

His reception at Leiden was all that he could have wished for. He received a handsome income; he was treated with the highest consideration. His supposed rank as a prince of Verona (a sensitive issue for the Scaligeri; see below) was recognized.
