40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the factors {{affecting}} the <b>trade</b> <b>flow</b> on forestry products within the European Union. A gravity model was used to estimate the factors affecting the <b>trade</b> <b>flow.</b> The study used a panel data set with observations of two forestry commodities between 28 EU member countries over the years 2005 to 2014. The commodities are Wood chips and particles and Industrial roundwood. The parameters are estimated with fixed effects, the result indicated for Wood chips and particles that exporting countries GDP affect the <b>trade</b> <b>flow</b> positivly (0. 64) and the importing countries GDP affect positively aswell (0. 36). For Industrial roundwood the exporting countries GDP affect the <b>trade</b> <b>flow</b> negatively (- 0. 69) and the importing countries GDP affect positively (0. 80).

25|$|An {{important}} part of the foreign exchange market comes from the financial activities of companies seeking foreign exchange to pay for goods or services. Commercial companies often trade fairly small amounts compared to those of banks or speculators, and their trades often have little short-term impact on market rates. Nevertheless, <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> are an important factor in the long-term direction of a currency's exchange rate. Some multinational corporations (MNCs) can have an unpredictable impact when very large positions are covered due to exposures that are not widely known by other market participants.|$|E

The largest <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> are with Germany, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, Netherlands and China. Trade policy is managed by the European Union, where Finland has traditionally been among the free trade supporters, except for agriculture. Finland is the only Nordic country to have joined the Eurozone; Denmark and Sweden have retained their traditional currencies, whereas Iceland and Norway are not members of the EU at all.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} World War II, much of Europe was devastated. Sustained aerial {{bombardment}} {{during the}} war had badly damaged most major cities, and industrial facilities were especially hard-hit. The region's <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> had been thoroughly disrupted; millions were in refugee camps living on aid from United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and other agencies. Food shortages were severe, especially in the harsh winter of 1946–47. From July 1945 through June 1946, the United States shipped 16.5 million tons of food, primarily wheat, to Europe and Japan. It amounted to one-sixth of the American food supply, and provided 35 trillion calories, enough to provide 400 calories a day for one year to 300 million people.|$|E

40|$|With globalization, {{countries}} are more connected than before by <b>trading</b> <b>flows,</b> which amounts {{to at least}} 36 trillion dollars today. Interestingly, around 30 - 60 percents of exports consist of intermediate products in global.

The problem is weather we can discriminate between these products from their unique flow network structure? This paper applies the flow analysis method developed in ecology to 638 <b>trading</b> <b>flow</b> networks of different products. We claim that the allometric scaling exponent η can be used to characterize the degree of hierarchicality of a flow network, i. e., whether the <b>trading</b> products <b>flow</b> on long hierarchical chains. Then, it is pointed out that the flow networks of products with higher added values and complexity like machinary, transport equipment etc. have larger exponents, meaning that their <b>trade</b> <b>flow</b> networks are more hierarchical.

25|$|Reflecting re-orientation of <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> in the 1950s and 1960s, Britain {{had decided}} in the late 1960s to re-orientate its trade and {{economic}} policy from the Commonwealth of Nations to the European Economic Community, and the 1960s and early 1970s saw a corresponding further reduction in the economic relationship between Britain and the major realms, including Australia. In 1967, the pound sterling was devalued, but Australia did not follow suit, instead moving to a peg between the Australian dollar and the pound sterling at a different rate. In 1971, Australia switched its peg altogether, to the United States dollar, and in June 1972 Britain responded to this and other changes resulting from Britain's shrinking economic presence {{in the world by}} shrinking the sterling area, effectively ending the former monetary union.|$|E
25|$|A {{liberalisation}} of import tariffs in 1797 {{marked the}} end of mercantilism and further liberalisation in the 19th {{and the beginning of the}} 20th century established the Danish liberal tradition in international trade that was only to be broken by the 1930s. Even when other countries, such as Germany and France, raised protection for their agricultural sector because of increased American competition resulting in much lower agricultural prices after 1870, Denmark retained its free trade policies, as the country profited from the cheap imports of cereals (used as feedstuffs for their cattle and pigs) and could increase their exports of butter and meat of which the prices were more stable. Today, Denmark is part of the European Union's internal market, which represents more than 508 million consumers. Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among European Union (EU) members and by EU legislation. Support for free trade is high among the Danish public; in a 2007 poll 76% responded that globalisation is a good thing. 70% of <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> are inside the European Union. , Denmark's largest export partners are Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Norway.|$|E
25|$|Around June 220, Qu Yan (麴演) rebelled {{again in}} Xiping Commandery {{and managed to}} garner support in two {{neighbouring}} commanderies, Zhangye and Jiuquan. His allies, Zhang Jin (張進) and Huang Hua (黃華), rebelled against Du Tong (杜通) and Xin Ji (辛機), the Administrators of Zhangye and Jiuquan respectively, and declared themselves the new Administrators. Zhang Jin even took Du Tong hostage. To make things worse, the non-Han Chinese tribes in Wuwei Commandery {{seized the opportunity to}} start raiding and pillaging counties, while other local elites (both Han Chinese and non-Han Chinese) throughout Yong and Liang provinces wanted to jump on the bandwagon and join the rebels. The rebellions caused a major disruption in <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> along the Hexi Corridor. Guanqiu Xing (毌丘興), the Administrator of Wuwei Commandery, sent an urgent report to Su Ze in Jincheng Commandery and sought his aid in dealing with the rebels. At the time, Su Ze had with him two military officers, Hao Zhao and Wei Ping (魏平), who were in command of Jincheng Commandery's armed forces. However, they were not allowed to lead the troops into battle without authorisation from the Han central government.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{faced with}} an {{increasingly}} globalized economy, China has carried out the strategy of free trade area, drawing {{the eyes of the}} entire world. In this paper, trading statistics of China and its 14 trading partners from 2000 to 2010 is taken as sample and a gravity model is expanded by adding variables including the access to free trade agreement to conduct a case analysis to the influence of international <b>trade</b> <b>flow.</b> According to the statistics, the economic size, population, culture and trading regime are all imposing much impact on China’s international trade.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of ACFTA {{is believed to}} be able to foster closer trade relationship among ASEAN member states and China. However, the spike of exports by China to the world after its accession into WTO in 2001 has caused fears across the world. Although ACFTA facilitates trade access into China’s huge market for ASEAN member states, the great line up of Chinese manufacturers do not only make this access challenging, the existing trade activities among ASEAN member states might also be affected by the Chinese competitors. This study examines the <b>trade</b> <b>flow</b> of parts and components and final goods from Malaysia to other ASEAN member states after the implementation of ACFTA. The workhorse of studying bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>flow,</b> gravity model, is employed.

Spite of this impoverishment of the ordinary shareholder, this railway system has evidently paid too much profit in the past for efficiency; the rolling stock is old and ageing--much of it is by modern standards abominable--the trains are infrequent, and the shunting operations at local stations, with insufficient sidings and insufficient staffs, produce a chronic dislocation and unpunctuality in the traffic that is exaggerated by the defects of direction evident even in the very time-tables. The trains are not well planned, the connections with branch lines are often extremely ill managed. The service is bad to its details. It is {{the exception rather than the}} rule to find a ticket-office in the morning with change for a five-pound note; and, as a little indication of the spirit of the whole machine, I discovered the other day that the conductors upon the South-Eastern trams at Hythe start their morning with absolutely no change at all.
