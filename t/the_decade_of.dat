During <b>the</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> 20012011, India's annual population growth rate has slowed down from 2.15 percent to 1.76 percent. Based on decennial census data, Dadra and Nagar Haveli have the fastest growth rate of 55.5percent, followed by Daman and Diu (53.5percent), Meghalaya (27.8percent) and Arunachal Pradesh (25.9percent). Nagaland recorded the lowest growth rate of -0.5percent.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} growth rate was higher during <b>the</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> 1981–90 {{due to increased}} provision of social, economic and recreational facilities that caused the rural population to migrate to urban areas. The overall growth rate had declined {{over the last two}} decades due to poor returns in agriculture and increased migration of agricultural labourers to other urban centres. The population density of the town is high in the centre and low in the peripheral regions.|$|E

5|$|Despite segregationist {{and racist}} attitudes, St. Louis {{acted as a}} haven during the 1917 East St. Louis Riot, as St. Louis police shepherded fleeing blacks across the Eads Bridge to shelter and food {{provided}} by the city government and the American Red Cross. Leonidas C. Dyer, who represented part of St. Louis in the U.S. House, led a Congressional investigation into the events and eventually sponsored an anti-lynching bill in response. Due to an influx of refugees from East St. Louis and the general effects of the Great Migration of blacks from the rural South to industrial cities, the black population of St. Louis increased more rapidly than the whole during <b>the</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> 1910 to 1920.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} dengue recover without any ongoing problems. The {{fatality}} rate is 1–5%, {{and less than}} 1% with adequate treatment; however those who develop significantly low blood pressure may have a fatality rate of up to 26%. Dengue is common in more than 110 countries. In 2013 it causes about 60 million symptomatic infections worldwide, with 18% admitted to hospital and about 13,600 deaths. The worldwide cost of dengue case is estimated US$9 billion. For <b>the</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> the 2000s, 12 countries in Southeast Asia were estimated to have about 3million infections and 6,000 deaths annually. It is reported in at least 22 countries in Africa; but is likely present {{in all of them}} with 20% of the population at risk.

5|$|Women's role in Pre-colonial social {{structures}} reveals that feminism was theorised differently in India {{than in the}} West. In India, women's issues first began to be addressed when the state commissioned {{a report on the}} status of women to a group of feminist researchers and activists. The report recognised the fact that in India, women were oppressed under a system of structural hierarchies and injustices. During this period, Indian feminists were influenced by the Western debates being conducted about violence against women. However, due to the difference in the historical and social culture of India, the debate in favour of Indian women had to be conducted creatively and certain Western ideas had to be rejected. Women's issues began to gain an international prominence when <b>the</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> 1975–1985 was declared the United Nations Decade for Women.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s, various {{computer}} games {{were created in}} the context of academic computer and programming research and for demonstrations of computing power, especially after the introduction later in <b>the</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> smaller and faster computers on which programs could be created and run in real time as opposed to being executed in batches. A few programs, however, while used to showcase the power of the computer they ran on were also intended as entertainment products; these were generally created by undergraduate and graduate students and university employees, such as at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where they were allowed on occasion to develop programs for the TX-0 experimental computer. These interactive graphical games were created by a community of programmers, many of them students and university employees affiliated with the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) led by Alan Kotok, Peter Samson, and Bob Saunders. The games included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and Mouse in the Maze, which used a light pen to set up a maze of walls for a virtual mouse to traverse.|$|E
