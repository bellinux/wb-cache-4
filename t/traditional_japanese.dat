5|$|At studio {{practices}} in New Hope, Pennsylvania and Tokyo, he explored <b>traditional</b> <b>Japanese</b> building techniques {{combined with the}} latest In American building innovations.

5|$|Raymond {{purchased}} {{land in the}} Nishi Azabu {{district of}} Tokyo to build his new office and living quarters. The office was built using the <b>traditional</b> <b>Japanese</b> post and lintel type construction using unplaned timber logs. The office served as a proving ground for the latest American building innovations including veneered plywood and suspended metal ductwork for forced air heating. Taking influence from Le Corbusier's modulor, Raymond used the <b>traditional</b> <b>Japanese</b> module of the ken (based upon the size of tatami mats) as a unit of measure to set out the building's structure. Again he used fusuma partitions and shoji screens, but in a modern way to divide up the spaces.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Tokugawa shogunate Sakakibara was {{instrumental}} in preserving <b>traditional</b> <b>Japanese</b> sword techniques in the early Meiji Era. Despite his eventual opposition to the practice of sword fighting for sport, his work during this period laid the foundations for the modern sport of kendo. In his later years he taught a number of noted martial artists, and was honoured by the All Japan Kendo Federation after his death.|$|E

5|$|One day I chanced {{to see a}} {{performance}} of the Bunraku puppet theater and was very surprised by it. It was in the tone quality, the timbre, of the futazao shamisen, the wide-necked shamisen used in Bunraku, that I first recognized the splendor of <b>traditional</b> <b>Japanese</b> music. I was very moved by it and I wondered why my attention had never been captured before by this Japanese music.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Gold and Silver {{are set in}} {{the region}} of Johto, {{situated}} {{to the west of the}} Kanto region from the previous Red and Blue games, and three years after the conclusion of the previous games. The design of Johto was inspired by Japan's Kansai and Tōkai regions, with many of the region's temples and more <b>traditional</b> <b>Japanese</b> aesthetics finding their way into Johto.|$|E
5|$|The Peace Plaza is the {{backdrop}} for the museum. The plaza was designed to allow 50 thousand people to gather around the peace monument in the centre.

The American version contained 13 exclusive tracks and remixes.|$|E
5|$|Zero: Tsukihami no Kamen, {{commonly}} {{referred to in the}} West as Mask of the Lunar Eclipse, has players taking control of four different character navigating a variety of different environments, including <b>traditional</b> <b>Japanese</b> houses and a Meiji-era sanatorium-turned-hotel. Environments are navigated from a third-person perspective using the Wii Nunchuk. During exploration, the characters are regularly attacked by hostile spirits, who take away the characters' health through touch.|$|E
5|$|Around the mid-1980s, German and Japanese representatives {{decided to}} rebuild the old Japanese embassy in Berlin from 1938. Its remains had {{remained}} unused after the building was largely destroyed during World War II. In addition to the original complex, several changes and additions were made until 2000, like moving the main entrance to the Hiroshima Street, which was named in honour of the Japanese city, {{and the creation of}} a <b>traditional</b> <b>Japanese</b> Garden.|$|E

5|$|Blood-C was {{designed}} to share only thematic similarities with earlier Blood projects. CLAMP was brought on board to both design the characters and help create the scenario. It featured several new elements to the Blood franchise, such as being primarily set within a high school environment. The Elder Bairns were inspired by the Great Old Ones from H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and modeled after <b>traditional</b> <b>Japanese</b> monsters. Its bloody violence, a stylistic choice following the series' themes, resulted in censorship in Japan and eventual blacklisting in China. The series has received mixed to positive reviews from journalists.|$|E
5|$|Del Rey Manga {{published}} the English {{translation of the}} first 16 volumes of School Rumble in physical format. In the translation, Del Rey Manga maintained the <b>traditional</b> <b>Japanese</b> name order to preserve puns based on the characters' names. Kodansha USA {{published the}} English translation in digital format. Funimation published {{the first and second}} anime seasons and the Extra Class OVAs in English. School Rumble has been translated into additional languages, although the final two episodes, the video games, and guidebooks have yet to be released outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{culture has}} evolved greatly from its origins. Contemporary culture {{combines}} influences from Asia, Europe and North America. <b>Traditional</b> <b>Japanese</b> arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games. Japan has a developed {{system for the}} protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures. Nineteen sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, fifteen of which are of cultural significance.|$|E

5|$|The {{illustrations}} {{provide insight}} into life and festivities at the Heian Palace; which sometimes consisted of {{something as simple as}} games on the lake although those might have been perceived differently at the time of manufacture. Like other picture scrolls on court life such as the Genji Monogatari Emaki or the Pillow Book Emaki (Makura no Sōshi Emaki) they provide valuable information on the architectural shinden-zukuri style (particularly on interiors) which is characterized by a mixture of Tang and <b>traditional</b> <b>Japanese</b> influences.|$|E
5|$|The {{tree sparrow}} {{has long been}} {{depicted}} in Chinese and Japanese art, often on a plant spray or in a flying flock, and representations by oriental artists including Hiroshige have featured on the postage stamps of Antigua and Barbuda, Central African Republic, China and the Gambia. More straightforward illustrations were used on the stamps of Belarus, Belgium, Cambodia, Estonia and Taiwan. The fluttering of the bird {{gave rise to a}} <b>traditional</b> <b>Japanese</b> dance, the Suzume Odori, developed in Sendai, which was depicted by artists such as Hokusai.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Trigger {{features}} standard role-playing {{video game}} gameplay. The player controls the protagonist {{and his companions}} in the game's two-dimensional fictional world, consisting of various forests, cities, and dungeons. Navigation occurs via an overworld map, depicting the landscape from a scaled-down overhead view. Areas such as forests, cities, and similar places are depicted as more realistic scaled-down maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. Chrono Triggers gameplay deviates from that of <b>traditional</b> <b>Japanese</b> RPGs in that, rather than appearing in random encounters, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the map rather than on a separate battle screen.|$|E

5|$|Founded in 1962, Tatsunoko Production {{celebrated their}} 40th year of {{animated}} film production by releasing Karas in 2005, their first production being Space Ace in 1965. Keiichi Sato {{joined the company}} as the project director after he pitched its concept of a life-sized dark hero to the management. He researched production and direction techniques from kabuki, a form of <b>traditional</b> <b>Japanese</b> theater; and Japanese staged sword fights as materials for the project. Choreographed sword fights rendered with 3D animation were rare at that time, and Sato felt this would help distinguish the show. The use of theatrical elements and movie shooting techniques in its presentation sets Karas apart from its contemporaries. Producer Kenji Nakamura felt the team's lack of experience in this area pushed them to ignore their previous animation work experience and break free of restrictions influenced by traditional animation production.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s, Takemitsu {{began to make}} use of <b>traditional</b> <b>Japanese</b> {{instruments}} in his music, and even took up playing the biwa—an instrument he used in his score for the film Seppuku (1962). In 1967, Takemitsu received a commission from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, to commemorate the orchestra's 125th anniversary, for which he wrote November Steps for biwa, shakuhachi, and orchestra. Initially, Takemitsu had great difficulty in uniting these instruments from such different musical cultures in one work. Eclipse for biwa and shakuhachi (1966) illustrates Takemitsu's attempts to find a viable notational system for these instruments, which in normal circumstances neither sound together nor are used in works notated in any system of Western staff notation.|$|E
5|$|In Garden Rain (1974, for brass ensemble), {{the limited}} and pitch-specific {{harmonic}} vocabulary of the Japanese mouth organ, the shō (see ex. 3), and its specific timbres, are clearly emulated in Takemitsu's writing for brass instruments; even similarities of performance practice can be seen, (the players are often required to hold notes {{to the limit}} of their breath capacity). In A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden, the characteristic timbres of the shō and its chords (several of which are simultaneous soundings of <b>traditional</b> <b>Japanese</b> pentatonic scales) are emulated in the opening held chords of the wind instruments (the first chord is in fact an exact transposition of the shō's chord, Jū (i); see ex. 3); meanwhile a solo oboe is assigned a melodic line that is similarly reminiscent of the lines played by the hichiriki in gagaku ensembles.|$|E
