However, it is challenging to accurately predict <b>the</b> remaining <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> in practical aerospace applications due to the presence of various uncertainties that affect prognostic calculations, and in turn, render <b>the</b> remaining <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> prediction uncertain. It is challenging to identify and characterize the various sources of uncertainty in prognosis, understand how each of these sources of uncertainty affect the uncertainty in <b>the</b> remaining <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> prediction, and thereby compute the overall uncertainty in <b>the</b> remaining <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> prediction. In order to achieve these goals, this paper proposes that the task of estimating <b>the</b> remaining <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> must be approached as an uncertainty propagation problem.

40|$|International audienceIn this work, we {{consider}} the problem of predicting <b>the</b> remaining <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> {{of a piece of}} equipment, based on data collected from a heterogeneous fleet working under different operating conditions. When the equipment experiences variable operating conditions, individual data-driven prognostic models are not able to accurately predict <b>the</b> remaining <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> during <b>the</b> entire equipment life. The objective of this work is to develop an ensemble approach of different prognostic models for aggregating their remaining <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> predictions in an adaptive way, for good performance throughout the degradation progression. Two data-driven prognostic models are considered, a homogeneous discrete-time finite-state semi-Markov model and a fuzzy similarity‚Äìbased model. The ensemble approach is based on a locally weighted strategy that aggregates the outcomes of the two prognostic models of the ensemble by assigning to each model a weight and a bias related to its local performance, that is, the accuracy in predicting <b>the</b> remaining <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> of patterns of a validation set similar to the one under study. The proposed approach is applied to a case study regarding a heterogeneous fleet of aluminum electrolytic capacitors used in electric vehicle powertrains.

Various research topics as data acquisition, fusion, diagnostics, prognostics and decision {{are involved in}} this domain. This paper presents an approach to estimate <b>the</b> Remaining <b>Useful</b> <b>Life</b> of equipment based on shapelet extraction. This approach makes use, in an offline step, of a history of run-to-failure data to extract discriminative rul-shapelets, i. e. patterns that are correlated with the RUL of the considered equipment. A library of rul-shapelets is hence extracted at this step. Then, in an online step, these rul-shapelets are compared to testing units and the ones that match these units are used to estimate their RULs. Therefore, the RUL estimation of a testing unit is based on patterns that have been selected for their high correlation with the RUL. This approach is hence different from classical similaritybased approaches that attempt to match complete testing units (or only late instants of testing units) with training ones to estimate the RUL.
