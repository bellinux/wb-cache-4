5|$|Ryzhkov's Plan and The 500 Days Programme were broadly similar, {{with both}} {{supporting}} price liberalisation, decentralisation and privatisation. The main {{difference between the}} two was Ryzhkov's desire to retain much of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>system,</b> free education for all and the continuance of a strong central government apparatus. The 500 Days Programme did not mention political union with the other Soviet republics, but instead weakened the authority of the central government by establishing a market economy. In other words, they left the question of continuing or dissolving the Soviet Union open. On 17 September in a meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev openly supported the 500 Days Programme, claiming it would not lead to the reestablishment of capitalism, but instead to a mixed economy where private enterprise played an important role.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} Germany’s {{fiscal policy}} position. Half of GDP {{passes through the}} hands of government, a high debt to GDP ratio limits the maneuvering, and the revenue sharing mechanism prevents a competitive federalism. Most importantly for the future, the federal finance minister has {{to pick up the}} deficits that <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems</b> leave behind. Transfers from the public budget to <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems</b> are large, and since 1998 the elasticity of transfers to nominal GDP is 4. This trend will intensify in an aging society. All these factors weaken the prospects for reform that Germany must undertake in its taxation and expenditure system in view of the changed international conditions.

Finally, we estimate what difference {{it would have made}} to the extent and incidence of poverty if <b>the</b> post-Beveridge <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>system</b> had been in place during the inter-war period. Our main conclusions are that <b>the</b> inter-war <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>system</b> had played a greater role in averting poverty than it has sometimes been given credit for, even though substantial poverty remained. <b>The</b> post-Beveridge <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>system,</b> if applied in the inter-war period, would have reduced poverty still further, but would not have eliminated it.

25|$|Social Security {{affects the}} saving {{behavior}} {{of the people in}} three different ways. The wealth substitution effect occurs when a person saving for retirement recognizes that <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>system</b> will take care of him and decreases his expectations about how much he needs to personally save. The retirement effect occurs when a taxpayer saves more each year in an effort to reduce the total number of years he must work to accumulate enough savings before retirement. The bequest effect occurs when a taxpayer recognizes a decrease in resources stemming from the Social Security tax and compensates by increasing personal savings to cover future expected costs of having children.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>system,</b> which {{expanded}} rapidly {{during the}} prosperous 1950s and 1960s, includes a medical system, unemployment insurance coverage, child allowances, invalid benefits, {{and other benefits}} and pensions. With the onset of a recession in the 1970s, this system became an increasing burden {{on the economy and}} accounted for much of the government budget deficits. The national unemployment figures mask considerable differences between Flanders and Wallonia. Unemployment in Wallonia is mainly structural, while in Flanders it is cyclical. Flanders' unemployment levels are generally only about half those of Wallonia. The southern region continues a difficult transition out of sunset industries (mainly coal and steel), while sunrise industries (chemicals, high-tech, and services) dominate in Flanders.|$|E
25|$|Critics of Social Security {{have said}} that the {{politicians}} who created Social Security exempted themselves from having to pay the Social Security tax. When the federal government created Social Security, all federal employees, including the president and members of Congress, were exempt from having to pay the Social Security tax, and they received no Social Security benefits. This law was changed by the Social Security Amendments of 1983, which brought within <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>system</b> all members of Congress, the president and the vice president, federal judges, and certain executive-level political appointees, as well as all federal employees hired in any capacity on or after January 1, 1984.
