5|$|The game's {{campaign}} received mixed impressions from reviewers. USgamer editor Jaz Rignall <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> {{for teaching}} {{the mechanics of}} the game and the progression of difficulty was reasonable. GameSpot reviewer Kallie Plagge thought the highest points of the campaign missions were the sequences that borrowed elements from the main Halo games. Brown stated that while the campaign was brief, he felt it had good pacing and there was a decent variety of objectives and scenarios. Stapleton agreed that the campaign missions offered enough variety to prevent them from becoming repetitive. However, overall he was unimpressed by the campaign missions, which he perceived as unambitious in their design. He was also surprised by the frequent bugs, which included crashing and mission events failing to trigger, that he experienced during his playthrough of the campaign on the Xbox One.|$|E

[...] Hillhouse rated the main event eight out of ten and the overall event six out of ten. When the Canadian Online Explorer polled its readers on the event, 26% did not watch the event, 5% thought it was disappointing, 6% thought it was okay and 63% <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>great.</b>|$|E

I didn't have any brothers, and I thought that's {{something}} I can do, one way I can make a contribution. My sisters <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>great,</b> but they were not interested. There was too much discipline and routine involved. I felt like it would be a challenge, to step forth and do it, to see what it was all about. It gave a sense of confidence. At the time girls just didn't join the WAVES or go into the military. But my Dad, he said, you'll be OK".|$|E
500|$|In March 1980 Sellers {{asked his}} fifteen-year-old {{daughter}} Victoria {{what she thought}} about Being There: she reported later that, [...] "I said yes, I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>great.</b> But then I said, 'You looked like a little fat old man'.... he went mad. He threw his drink over {{me and told me}} to get the next plane home." [...] His other daughter Sarah told Sellers her thoughts about the incident and he sent her a telegram that read [...] "After what happened this morning with Victoria, I shall be happy if I never hear from you again. I won't tell you what I think of you. It must be obvious. Goodbye, Your Father." ...|$|E
500|$|Her first project {{there was}} to reprise her role as Clear Rivers in the sequel to Final Destination {{entitled}} Final Destination 2. In an interview with IGN, Larter explained her return to the franchise: [...] "When New Line {{asked me to come}} back, I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>great.</b> They showed me the script and let me have some input, and it was really terrific." [...] The film made US$90 million worldwide, to a mixed critical reception. A year later, Larter served as an associate producer of and starred in the thriller Three Way, and in 2005, she appeared in the independent political thriller Confess, and had a role in the romantic comedy A Lot Like Love, starring Amanda Peet and Ashton Kutcher.|$|E

500|$|The {{protagonist of}} the prior film, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), was killed {{off-screen}} in the film. Rumors indicated that Sawa had a contract dispute with New Line concerning the deduction of his salary; however, Perry resolved {{the issue with}} the statement that [...] "it had everything to do with narrative, and nothing to do with money or Devon’s unwillingness to come back." [...] Despite this, New Line reinstated Ali Larter to reprise her character as Clear Rivers. [...] "When New Line asked me to come back, I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>great.</b> They showed me the script and let me have some input, and it was really terrific," [...] Larter revealed.

500|$|After {{working with}} the cover for the album, {{provisionally}} titled Runaway Train, Levy went on vacation and travelled with Pearl Jam on their 2008 tour. After a concert in Washington D.C., Levy {{came up with the}} idea [...] "to do it all graphic black on black" [...] and sketched what would become the yellow artwork. The record company liked it and requested he do two more in the same style, which became the red and white versions. During the promotional photography sessions, Levy made the deluxe edition art. The tracks on the album did not have much influence on the artwork as Levy had heard [...] "maybe 5 songs at that point", but he found it curious that his artwork fit the title track [...] "Black Ice", which was not among the tracks he had heard. Levy said that since the album had many similarities with Back in Black – [...] "Black" [...] in the title, dark covers, and AC/DC resurfacing with a sound based on the band's early work – the art was [...] "like a time travel, which is why there are so many psychedelic drawings". The artwork's resemblance to a train, echoing lead single [...] "Rock N' Roll Train", was a coincidence, given Levy [...] "never thought of it that way". Atop the image there is a cog with an image of Angus with his fist in the air resembling the statue on Stiff Upper Lip, because Levy [...] "just <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> as a continuing icon." [...] The photographs for the booklet and promotional photography were taken by music photographer Guido Karp, in August 2008 in London.|$|E
2500|$|Beatles biographer Nicholas Schaffner {{describes}} the song as [...] "a showbizzy send-off". The lyrics allow Starr to farewell the listener, as he sings: [...] "Me and the band, babe, all <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> / To entertain you / But it's getting late and it's time to leave." [...] Author Ian Inglis notes {{the similarity between}} [...] "You and Me (Babe)" [...] and the Beatles songs [...] "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" [...] and [...] "Good Night", through its incorporation of a songwriting device whereby the performer directly addresses his audience.|$|E

60|$|No {{more of this}} {{operation}} was necessary than the assurance that Miss Underwood was going, and that Mrs. Harewood would {{be a sort of}} chaperon. Alice Knevett was happy and grateful; and if anything were wanting to the universal enthusiasm of anticipation, it was supplied by Lance. The boy, with his musical talent, thorough trustworthiness and frank joyous manners, was a favourite with the organist, and was well versed in the programme; and his eagerness, and fulness of detail, were enough to infect every one. Geraldine <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> proof of his unspoilableness, that he took quite as much pleasure in bringing them to these services, where he would be but a unit in the hundreds, {{as if it had been}} one of the anthems, of which every one said, 'Have you heard little Underwood?' In the charm of the general welcome and the congratulation on Lance's arrangement, Geraldine had quite forgotten both her alarms and her tiny pang of surprise at not having been Felix's prime thought. Lance, by dint of a judicious mixture of hectoring and coaxing, obtained leave for Angela to be of the party, though against Wilmet's judgment; and Bernard and Stella were to spend the day with Mrs. Froggatt, which they regarded as an expedition quite as magnificent as that to St. Mary's Minster.|$|E
