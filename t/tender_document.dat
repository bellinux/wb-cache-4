Over 30 builders were contacted, with William Brown & Son of Manchester winning the contract to construct the new building. Work began in 1904, with {{the first nine months of}} construction focusing on laying the building's foundations, which were dug to a depth of [...] below ground level. The building's frame was built from reinforced concrete, which was then clad in Portland Stone, a design that meant the building was more fire resistant than with other structural forms. It was completed in 1907 at a cost of approximately £250,000, although when the cost of furniture, fittings and professional fees was taken into account, the total cost was nearer £350,000. Staff from the MDHB headquarters officially moved into the building on 15 July 1907, with staff from departments located in other areas of the city moving in throughout the rest of the year.|$|E

The construction industry can gain much benefit from automation, especially in automatic document generation and recognition. In this paper, an automatic system for recognizing tables in construction <b>tender</b> <b>documents</b> is introduced. <b>Tender</b> <b>documents</b> contain {{a special kind of}} forms. The object-oriented attributed relationship graph (OO-ARG) is introduced to be the representation scheme for structuring the information contained in forms. The OO-ARG representation scheme is the core of the computer system for recognizing and interpreting <b>tender</b> <b>documents.</b> The system consists of two main modules: table modeler and table reader. The table modeler assists users to construct form models, and the table reader recognizes the input tables from the model database and re-generates electronic tables. Experimental results indicate that the system is efficient and applicable in recognizing construction <b>tender</b> <b>documents.</b> Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R

40|$|Tendering {{is one of}} {{the stages}} in {{construction}} procurement that requires extensive information and <b>documents</b> exchange. However, <b>tender</b> <b>documents</b> are not always clear in practice. The aim {{of this study was to}} ascertain the clarity and adequacy of <b>tender</b> <b>documents</b> used in practice. Access was negotiated into two UK construction firms and the whole tender process for two projects was shadowed for 6 - 7 weeks in each firm using an ethnographic approach. A significant amount of tender queries, amendments and addenda were recorded. This showed that quality of tender documentation is still a problem in construction despite the existence of standards like Co-ordinated Project Information (1987) and British Standard 1192 (1984 and 1990) that are meant to help in producing clear and consistent project information. Poor quality <b>tender</b> <b>documents</b> are a source of inaccurate estimates, claims and disputes on contracts. Six recommendations are presented to help in improving the quality of tender documentation. Further research is needed into the recommendations to help improve the quality of <b>tender</b> <b>documents,</b> perhaps in conjunction with an industry-wide investigation into the level of incorporation of CPI principles in practice...|$|R

This fact also enabled Foster Yeoman to reduce its requirement from the original six locomotives to four.|$|E

50|$|The {{decision}} of the Karnataka High Court was accepted by the Government of India at the highest level, viz. the Union Cabinet, in its meeting held on 27 July 2006. The Company Court was informed accordingly by the Ministry of Mines in a sworn affidavit in December 2006. The proposal {{of the government to}} hand over the mines to the employees' federation at a price to be determined through a global tender was approved by the High Court in July 2009 and confirmed in a Review petition filed by government a few months later. However, after that the picture became blurred. All movement on the revival front from the Ministry of Mines came to a halt and {{there was no sign of}} the tender. It was speculated in some circles that the rise in the price of gold could be inducing government to go back on its decision to let the unions run the mines. Others saw the hidden hand still at work since no matter how high the price of gold goes the resources are too meagre to make mining operations viable enough to justify government intervention through the public exchequer. In early 2010, the Ministry of Mines suddenly decided to go in appeal to the Division Bench seeking changes in the <b>Tender</b> <b>Document</b> approved by the single bench. In February 2010, in the course of hearing before the Division Bench the advocate of the Ministry of Mines informed the Karnataka High Court that the Government has decided to revive the mines on its own. In the light of this decision the Division Bench quashed the single bench order. However, since there was no further progress in the matter even after several months the unions filed a Review Petition in which they challenged the very authenticity of the statement made on behalf of the Ministry in the court but the court would have none of it. The plea of the unions was turned down without obtaining any kind of commitment from the government about revival.|$|E
