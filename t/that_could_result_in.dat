5|$|Nest size {{depends on}} species of bumblebee. Most form colonies of between 50 and 400 individuals, but colonies have been {{documented}} as small as ~20 individuals and as large as 1700. These nests are small compared to honeybee hives, which hold about 50,000 bees. Many species nest underground, choosing old rodent burrows or sheltered places, and avoiding places that receive direct sunlight <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> overheating. Other species make nests above ground, whether in thick grass or in holes in trees. A bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs {{like that of a}} honeybee; the cells are instead clustered together untidily. The workers remove dead bees or larvae from the nest and deposit them outside the nest entrance, helping to prevent disease. Nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter.|$|E
5|$|Szilard {{drafted a}} {{confidential}} {{letter to the}} President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning of a German nuclear weapon project, explaining the possibility of nuclear weapons, and encouraging {{the development of a}} program <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> their creation. With the help of Eugene Wigner and Edward Teller, he approached his old friend and collaborator Albert Einstein in August 1939, and convinced him to sign the letter, lending his prestige to the proposal. The Einstein–Szilard letter resulted in the establishment of research into nuclear fission by the U.S. government. An Advisory Committee on Uranium was formed under Lyman J. Briggs, a scientist {{and the director of the}} National Bureau of Standards. Its first meeting on 21 October 1939, was attended by Szilard, Teller and Wigner. The scientists persuaded the Army and Navy to provide $6,000 for Szilard to purchase supplies for experiments—in particular, more graphite.|$|E

5|$|When DC comics relaunched its {{universe}} in 2011, many of Batman's stories were erased or altered, but The Killing Joke story was still intact. In the new continuity, Barbara Gordon {{recovered from the}} paralysis inflicted upon her by the Joker's bullet, which lasted for four years. Although she resumes her work as Batgirl one year after recovering her mobility, she continues to suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder when exposed to gunfire <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> receiving new spinal damage. During Batman Eternal, Batgirl refers to her paralysis when she tracks a villain to the carnival where the Joker took Gordon after he had shot her, although she only confronts the Joker's Daughter rather than the Joker himself as Joker is currently presumed dead.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Wallace {{published}} the book Island Life as {{a sequel to}} The Geographical Distribution of Animals. It surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands. Wallace classified islands into three different types. Oceanic islands, such as the Galapagos and Hawaiian Islands (then known as the Sandwich Islands) formed in mid-ocean and never part of any large continent. Such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and their inhabitants (with the exceptions of migratory birds and species introduced by human activity) were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution. He divided continental islands into two separate classes depending on whether they had recently {{been part of a}} continent (like Britain) or much less recently (like Madagascar) and discussed how that difference affected the flora and fauna. He talked about how isolation affected evolution and how <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> the preservation of classes of animals, such as the lemurs of Madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas. He extensively discussed how changes of climate, particularly periods of increased glaciation, may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands, and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of these great ice ages. Island Life was considered a very important work {{at the time of its}} publication. It was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence.|$|E

The prosecutor handling the investigation said he would bring commercial fraud charges <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> imprisonment for the violators. The producers in question were suspected of adding wine made from non-approved grapes {{in order to make it}} more appealing to the international market. In response the U.S. government blocked imports of Brunello that did not have proof that they were in fact 100% Sangiovese. The scandal was coined Brunellopoli by the Italian wine press.|$|E
25|$|All of {{the most}} common types of acro {{footwear}} provide both traction and cushioning. In addition, acro performance surfaces are frequently rough, so acro footwear must protect the bottom of the foot from skin abrasion. Abrasion protection is particularly important on the ball of the foot, which is subjected to a great deal of friction during dance turns and leaps. Traction is essential to prevent lateral slipping <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> dangerous falls to the hard floor. Cushioning serves to soften the impact when performing tricks such as tucks and layouts, in which a dancer's feet may strike the floor at high velocity. Cushioning is especially important when a Marley floor is unavailable, because uncovered performance surfaces have no cushioning whatsoever and thus may be extremely hard and unyielding.|$|E

25|$|In June 2012, Israeli State Comptroller Micha Lindenstrauss {{released}} {{a report on the}} decision-making process leading to the flotilla raid. It found major fault with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision-making process over the events, stating that he failed to organize an orderly and coordinated discussion with other Israeli leaders, instead consulting Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman in undocumented meetings. Netanyahu was also criticized for his failure to call a cabinet meeting to discuss the matter, despite the requests of Defense Minister Ehud Barak, IDF Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi, and Strategic Affairs Minister Moshe Yaalon. He instead consulted the forum of seven, a group of seven cabinet ministers with no constitutional basis, once before leaving to visit North America. The meeting took place five days before the raid, and relevant officials, including the Justice and Internal Security Ministers, were not invited, and the discussion was not in line with national security-related decision-making protocols. The report also found fault with Netanyahu failing to hold a discussion with the defense and foreign ministers to start a dialogue <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> a diplomatic and political effort to prevent the flotilla from leaving or prevent it from getting as far as it did.|$|E
25|$|The {{roots of}} the modern Champagne {{industry}} were laid during the Industrial Revolution which saw vast leaps in understanding the method of making sparkling wine and improvements in the technology needed to make production more financially feasible. The French scientist Jean-Antoine Chaptal popularized the understanding that Champagne sparkled because it was sealed in a bottle before fermentation was complete. He further noted {{that it was the}} sugar in the wine that facilitated this fermentation process resulting in bubbles. Along with the bubbles came intense pressure from the carbon dioxide gas <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> the bottles exploding. The disturbance caused by one bottle's disintegration could cause a chain reaction, with it being routine for cellars to lose 20–90% of their bottles to instability. The British method of coal fired glassmaking contributed to stronger wine bottles being available that could withstand the pressure of the carbon dioxide gas better. In the 1830s, a pharmacist from Châlons-sur-Marne named André François outlined formulas with precise measurements of how much sugar is needed to make a wine sparkle without producing more pressure than the wine bottle could withstand. Corking machines and improved corks made sealing the wine easier with less opportunity for the precious gas to seep out of the bottle.|$|E
