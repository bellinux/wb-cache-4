5|$|The cathedral was {{constructed}} {{over a period}} of over two centuries, between 1573 and 1813. Its design is a mixture of three architectural styles that predominated during <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period,</b> Renaissance, Baroque and Neo-classic.|$|E
5|$|As in <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period,</b> the Pine Bush {{continued}} to be tapped for its natural resources, with water becoming a target for development. The Patroon Creek, roughly where three feeder streams joined {{in the heart of}} the Pine Bush along Albany's northern border, was dammed in 1850 to form Rensselaer Lake waterworks.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period,</b> present-day Argentina offered fewer {{economic}} advantages {{compared to}} other parts of the Spanish Empire such as Mexico or Peru, which caused it to assume a peripheral position within the Spanish colonial economy. It lacked deposits of gold or other precious metals, nor did it have established native civilizations to subject to the encomienda.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century Madagascar had {{the most}} {{developed}} and modern school system in pre-colonial Sub-Saharan Africa. Access to schooling was expanded in coastal areas during <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period,</b> with French language and basic work skills becoming the focus of the curriculum. During the post-colonial First Republic, a continued reliance on French nationals as teachers, and French as the language of instruction, displeased those desiring a complete separation from the former colonial power.|$|E
5|$|Clemuel Ricketts, the {{architect}} of the stone house, was very interested in architecture from <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period</b> and had traveled widely. In the 1840s he published a book which examined the British and European sources of colonial architecture in the United States. Clemuel designed the house in the colonial or Georgian style in the early 1850s; construction began in either 1851 or 1854 and finished the next year.|$|E

5|$|Indigenous {{resistance}} was stubborn, and Montejo {{did not complete}} the conquest of western and central Honduras until 1539. Once he had established Spanish control there, he headed east to pacify the Olancho valley. Although the conquest {{of the west and}} centre of the territory was difficult, and the natives were well organised, resistance in the east took much longer to put down, and rebellions there lasted throughout <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mogadishu is a {{multi-ethnic}} city. Its original core population {{consisted of}} Bushmen aboriginals, and later Cushitic, Arab and Persian migrants. The mixture of these various groups produced the Benadiri or Reer Xamar (“People of Mogadishu”), a composite population {{unique to the}} larger Benadir region. In <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period,</b> European expatriates, primarily Italians, would {{also contribute to the}} city's cosmopolitan populace.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, the Portuguese {{presence}} on the Angolan coast remained limited for much of <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period.</b> The degree of real colonial settlement was minor, and, with few exceptions, the Portuguese did not interfere by means other than commercial {{in the social and}} political dynamics of the native peoples. There was no real delimitation of territory; Angola, to all intents and purposes, did not yet exist.|$|E

5|$|Only {{two-thirds of}} its present {{territory}} were occupied during <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period,</b> as the remaining third consisted of the Patagonian Plateau, which remains sparsely populated to this day. The agricultural and livestock sector's output was principally consumed by the producers themselves and by the small local market, and only became associated with foreign trade {{towards the end of}} the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The Vicinage clause has {{its roots}} in medieval English {{criminal}} procedure, the perceived abuses of criminal vicinage and venue during <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period</b> and Anti-federalist objections to the United States Constitution. The clause {{is one of the few}} constitutional criminal procedure provisions that has not been incorporated to apply to proceedings in state courts, along with the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment and (possibly) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the start}} of <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period,</b> the region of South Kasai formed part of the Luba Empire, a {{federation}} of local kingdoms {{with a degree of}} cultural uniformity. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Baluba spread across large parts of the Kasai-Katanga savannah along the Kasai river basin and eventually developed into a number of ethnic subgroups, notably the Luba-Kasai and the Luba-Katanga. Although never united into a single centralised state, the groups retained a degree of emotional attachment based around shared origin myths and cultural practices. Other groups, like the Songye and the Kanyok, also had long histories in the Kasai region.|$|E
5|$|Charles Atangana (c. 1880 – 1 September 1943), {{also known}} by his birth name, Ntsama, and his German name, Karl, was the {{paramount}} {{chief of the}} Ewondo and Bane ethnic groups during much of <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period</b> in Cameroon. Although from an unremarkable background, Atangana's loyalty and friendship with colonial priests and administrators secured him successively more prominent posts in the colonial government. He proved himself an intelligent and diplomatic administrator and an eager collaborator, and he was eventually named paramount chief of two Beti-Pahuin subgroups, the Ewondo and Bane peoples. His loyalty and acquiescence to the German Empire was unquestioning, and he even accompanied the Germans on their escape from Africa in World War I.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period,</b> in the 19th century, Kanaks were {{recruited}} or enslaved, to perform unfree labour {{in places such}} as Australia, California, Canada, Chile and Fiji (with the inter-Asian slave trade to India, Japan, South Africa, and what is now Malaysia). During the 3,000 years that Kanaks lived in the remote islands, they were unprepared for the arrival of European viruses and bacteria. The Kanaks were uprooted from the land and were employed as forced labour on French plantations, ranches and public works.|$|E

5|$|Grammars and {{dictionaries}} {{of indigenous}} languages were composed throughout <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period,</b> but their quality was {{highest in the}} initial period. The friars found that learning all the indigenous languages was impossible in practice, so they concentrated on Nahuatl. For a time, the linguistic situation in Mesoamerica remained relatively stable, but in 1696, Charles II of Spain issued a decree banning {{the use of any}} language other than Spanish throughout the Spanish Empire. In 1770 another decree, calling for the elimination of the indigenous languages, did away with Classical Nahuatl as a literary language. Until Mexican Independence in 1821, the Spanish courts admitted Nahuatl testimony and documentation as evidence in lawsuits, with court translators rendering it in Spanish.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period,</b> {{most of the}} {{surviving}} Chajoma were forcibly settled in the towns of San Juan Sacatepéquez, San Pedro Sacatepéquez and San Martín Jilotepeque {{as a result of}} the Spanish policy of congregaciones; the people were moved to whichever of the three towns was closest to their pre-conquest land holdings. Some Iximche Kaqchikels seem also to have been relocated to the same towns. After their relocation some of the Chajoma drifted back to their pre-conquest centres, creating informal settlements and provoking hostilities with the Poqomam of Mixco and Chinautla along the former border between the pre-Columbian kingdoms. Some of these settlements eventually received official recognition, such as San Raimundo near Sacul.|$|E
5|$|The first pol in Ahmedabad {{was named}} Mahurat Pol. Old city also houses the main railway station, the main post office, and some {{buildings}} of the Muzaffarid and British eras. <b>The</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>period</b> saw {{the expansion of the}} city to the western side of Sabarmati, facilitated by the construction of Ellis Bridge in 1875 and later the relatively modern Nehru Bridge. The western part of the city houses educational institutions, modern buildings, residential areas, shopping malls, multiplexes and new business districts centred around roads such as Ashram Road, C. G. Road and Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Highway.|$|E
