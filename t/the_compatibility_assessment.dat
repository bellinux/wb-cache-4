40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Compatibility</b> <b>Assessment</b> Method (CAM), a new {{structured}} {{process for}} assessing compatibility between parent systems and child subsystems is proposed {{and applied to}} several cases where subsystems are being replaced in legacy systems. CAM is a screening process intended {{to be used by}} project managers who need to replace components of complex systems. The functional model-based process uses an extension of the Integrated Definition Modeling Language of IDEFO. The IDEFO method is used for defining compatibility measures based on each of the four constituent arrows that show inputs, controls, outputs, and mechanisms (ICOM). In this extension, the control constituents are replaced with constraints. Each of the ICOM constituents is expanded with parameters which include metrics and values. The ICOMs with their parameters and metrics are then used to characterize two or more subsystems in a matrix format. The differences between these matrices are entered into the sparse "Delta Matrix" which shows analysts the differences between the systems. These differences can be assigned to the appropriate levels of technical expertise to be analyzed and to determine feasibility of the child subsystem in the parent system. The process is compared to current practices in government unmanned aircraft system program offices to determine the usefulness of adopting this compatibility assessment process. This dissertation outlines the need for and development of the method for application by practitioners responsible for replacing subsystems on legacy systems. The development includes evaluations of the method and an experiment with cohorts of student system engineers to compare the output of <b>the</b> <b>Compatibility</b> <b>Assessment</b> Method to less-structured methods. This research contributes additional insight into system architecting theory and proposes a structured method for practitioners to use to improve the processes to perform part replacement in legacy systems. While others have offered methods to measure aspects of system architecture, this proposed method moves beyond the extant literature with tools for practitioners. by David Scott Andrew Long.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a system of}} {{numerical}} models for <b>the</b> <b>compatibility</b> <b>assessment</b> of reservoir sediment flushing and protection of downstream river environments. The model system {{is made up of}} two simulation models. The first model simulates soil erosion in watershed slopes and sediment transport in the tributary of the reservoir by means of a weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) method, which is conservative and fourth-order accurate in space and time. The second model simulates velocity and suspended solid concentration fields in the reservoirs. This model is based on the three-dimensional (3 D) numerical integration of motion and concentration equations, expressed in contravariant form on a generalized boundary-conforming curvilinear coordinate system by using a conservative and higher-order accurate numerical scheme. The proposed system of models is applied to the Pieve di Cadore (Veneto, Italy) reservoir and to its catchment area. By comparing suspended solid concentrations that are discharged through the bottom outlets during flushing operations with suspended solid concentrations in the main river during natural flooding, we perform an assessment of the compatibility between sediment flushing and the protection of the river ecosystem downstream.

40|$|The EU State aid reform The {{implementation}} of the State aid action plan This work {{is divided into three}} sections. The first section defines State aid under the Article 107 (1) of the Treaty of Functioning of the EU. In this regard, {{on the basis of the}} EU Courts case law, it is explained what the "State resources" are, under which conditions the State intervention is "imputable to the State", what can be considered as "an undertaking" and "an advantage" as well as under which conditions an aid can have "an effect on trade and distort (or threaten to distort) the competition on the internal market". Consequently, Article 107 (2) and (3) of the TFEU is examined and the difference is highlighted between the State aid that is compatible per se on the basis of the TFEU and the State aid that may be declared compatible with the TFEU by the Commission. The second section is first dedicated to the principles on which the Action plan of was based. The role of the "refined economic approach" in general and the importance of "incentive effect of aid", "market failure" and "proportionality" for <b>the</b> <b>compatibility</b> <b>assessment</b> of State aid in particular is discussed.

In particular, it exposes Mexicos relevant AD facts and trends; and asserts that some empirical studies suggest that Mexicos AD measures pursue political purposes other than remedying unfair trade practices. In order to conduct a WTO compatibility assessment of the Mexican anti-dumping system, this thesis lays down, first, the WTO anti-dumping agreement or ADA, and the jurisprudence interpreting the rules and principles disciplining the activities of the WTO Members concerning anti-dumping measures.

Testing performed on highly volatile liquids such as cleaning solvents has proven problematic due to inconsistent test results (non-ignitions).

The research focuses {{on the topic of}} structural interaction in collisions involving passenger vehicles, a phenomenon describing the efficiency of energy dissipation within existing deformation-zones of a passenger vehicle during a collision. A new definition for structural interaction was developed and several metrics to evaluate structural interaction and compatibility in car-to-car collisions were proposed, based on the commonly known Equivalent Energy Speed (EES) metric. The new EES metrics describe equivalent closing velocities for a given collision based on the energy dissipated within the front-ends (EESFF) and the entire structure (EESVV) of both vehicles involved in a head-on collision. These metrics form the basis of the new knowledge generated by this research. Additionally, a new method was developed to measure the amount of energy dissipated through structural deformation in a collision, based on accelerometer readings. This method was applied to several experimental and simulationbased car-to-car collisions and the validity of the method was proven. Based on the energy dissipation which occurred in the car-to-car collisions analysed, <b>the</b> degree of <b>compatibility</b> reached and <b>the</b> level of structural interaction which occurred in each collision was evaluated by applying the newly developed EESFF and EESVV metrics.

This is particularly so for many military air- craft {{and is likely to}} become a more pressing issue for both new military systems with highly embedded engines as well as for novel civil aircraft configurations. During the late 1960 s with the advent of turbo-fan engines, industry became in- creasingly aware of issues which arise due to inlet total pressure distortion. Since then, inlet-engine <b>compatibility</b> <b>assessments</b> have become a key aspect of any new development. In addition to total temperature and total pressure distortions, flow angularity and the associated swirl distortion are also known to be of notable con- cern. The importance of developing a rigorous methodology to understand the effects of swirl distortion on turbo-machinery has also become one of the major concerns of current design programmes. The goal of this doctoral research was to further the current knowledge on swirl distortion, and its adverse effects on engine performance, focusing on the turbo-machinery components (i. e. fans or compressors). This was achieved by looking into appropriate swirl flow descriptors and by correlating them against the compressor performance parameters (e. g loss in stability pressure ratios). To that end, a number of high-fidelity three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models have been developed using two sets of transonic rotors (i. e. NASA Rotor 67 and 37), and a stator (NASA Stator 67 B). For the numerical purpose, a boundary condition methodology for the definition of swirl distortion patterns at the inlet has been developed. Various swirl distortion numerical parametric studies have been performed using the modelled rotor configurations. Two types of swirl distortion pattern were investigated in the research, i. e. the pure bulk swirl and the tightly-wound vortex. Numerical simulations suggested that the vortex core location, polarity, size and strength greatly affect the compressor performance. The bulk swirl simula- tions also showed the dependency on swirl strength and polarity. This empha- sized the importance of quantifying these swirl components in the flow distortion descriptors. For this, a methodology have been developed for <b>the</b> inlet-engine <b>compatibility</b> <b>assessment</b> using different types of flow descriptors.

Neighbouring land uses can produce externalities and negative impacts on other land uses because of inter-land use interaction. These externalities may be undesirable effects such as noise, air and visual pollution or may be caused by hazardous facilities. The main objective of this research is to propose a new multi-criteria evaluation model for land use <b>compatibility</b> <b>assessment.</b> Considering <b>the</b> fact that a considerable number of factors affect <b>the</b> <b>compatibility</b> degree of neighbouring land uses, a multi-criteria evaluation approach is employed to address the aforementioned problem. This research employs the integration of Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) methods to facilitate land use compatibility evaluation with respect to optimism degree. The applicability of the proposed model is illustrated by the problem of land use <b>compatibility</b> <b>assessment</b> for elementary schools in Tehran. The results indicate that most of the current schools are situated in a location which is incompatible for the land use type of elementary school especially in the southern and central parts of the city...|$|R
40|$|Health {{effects from}} Martian dusts {{will be a}} concern for any manned Mars missions. Nuisance dusts plagued the Apollo astronauts, but dusts of more {{hazardous}} mineralogy, in habitats occupied by Mars astronauts weakened by a long-duration mission, {{may be more than}} a nuisance. Chemical hazards in Martian regolith attributable to S, Cl, Br, Cd, and Pb are known or strongly suspected to be present, but terrestrial studies of the health effects of dusts indicate that accurate determination of mineralogy is a critical factor in evaluating inhalation hazards. Mineral inhalation hazards such as the Group-I carcinogenic zeolite erionite, which is demonstrated to cause mesothelioma, cannot be identified by chemical analysis alone. Studies of palagonite analogs raise the possibility that erionite may occur on Mars. In addition to health effects concerns, environmental mineralogy has significant importance in resource extraction, groundwater use, and sustained agriculture. The high sulfur and chlorine content of Martian regolith will affect all of these uses, but the nature of mineralogic reservoirs for S and Cl will determine their uptake and concentration in extracted groundwater and in agricultural applications of regolith. Wet chemistry experiments planned for <b>the</b> Mars Environmental <b>Compatibility</b> <b>Assessment</b> (MECA) will define some of the consequences of water/soil interaction, but an understanding of the mineralogic basis for water-rock reactions is needed to understand the mechanisms of reaction and to apply the results of a few experiments to larger scales and different conditions...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> Mars Environmental <b>Compatibility</b> <b>Assessment</b> (MECA) is an {{instrument}} suite that will {{fly on the}} Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander Spacecraft. MECA {{is sponsored by the}} Human Exploration and Development of Space (HEDS) program and will evaluate potential hazards that the dust and soil of Mars might present to astronauts and their equipment on a future human mission to Mars. Four elements constitute the integrated MECA payload: a microscopy station, patch plates, an electrometer, and the wet chemistry laboratory (WCL). The WCL consists of four identical cells, each of which will evaluate a sample of Martian soil in water to determine conductivity, pH, redox potential, dissolved C 02 and 02 levels, and concentrations of many soluble ions including sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and the halides. In addition, cyclic voltammetry will be used to evaluate reversible and irreversible oxidants present in the water/soil solution. Anodic stripping voltammetry will be used to measure concentrations of trace metals including lead, copper, and cadmium at ppb levels. Voltammetry is a general electrochemical technique that involves controlling the potential of an electrode while simultaneously measuring the current flowing at that electrode. The WCL experiments will provide information on the corrosivity and reactivity of the Martian soil, as well as on soluble components of the soil which might be toxic to human explorers. They will also guide HEDS scientists in the development of high fidelity Martian soil simulants. In the process of acquiring information relevant to HEDS, the WCL will assess the chemical composition and properties of the salts present in the Martian soil...|$|R
40|$|Scale {{formation}} and well plugging {{due to the}} incompatibility of injected wastewaters is a critical field problem in wastewater disposal wells. When different wastewaters are mixed, {{it is necessary to}} evaluate their <b>compatibility</b> prior to <b>the</b> injection into disposal wells. The individual wastewaters may be quite stable at all system conditions and present no scale problems. However, once they are mixed, reaction between ions dissolved in the individual wastewaters may form insoluble products that cause permeability damage {{in the vicinity of the}} wellbore. In this paper, the composition of different wastewaters, collecting from a few disposal wells of southwest Iranian crude oil desalting plants, were analyzed critically. Laboratory studies as well as field experience have shown that formation damage in wastewater disposal wells may occur mainly due to the conception of Iron Sulfide in the case of mixing a wastewater, which contains Iron ions with a wastewater containing H 2 S. In this repect, a new correlation has been developed for estimating the critical concentration of Iron ions, Fe(2 +) (ferrous ion), which will stay in solution at various pH values and a wide range of H 2 S concentration in crude oil desalting plants’ disposal wastewaters. This correlation eliminates <b>the</b> need for <b>compatibility</b> <b>assessment,</b> which is usually assessed either by solubility calculations or by experimental testing, for water mixtures that contains Iron ions and dissolved H 2 S. Finally, a real case field problem was analyzed and based on the correlation’s results, three different potential solutions were recommended for further field trial implementation...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>assessment</b> of <b>compatibility</b> in frontal impacts has {{to address}} the {{importance}} of different vehicle structures. A critical component in the assessment is to identify, quantitatively, what constitutes good performing structures. In particular, the concepts of structural alignment and structural interaction need to be investigated. Structural alignment is incorporated in <b>the</b> FIMCAR candidate <b>compatibility</b> <b>assessments</b> to achieve geometric alignment of identifiable crashworthiness structures. Structural interaction is also a global assessment of how structures interact with a collision partner during the crash. The performance of lower vehicle structures in a crash {{has been identified as}} important as they may not be evaluated in a structural alignment assessment, but can contribute to structural interaction and thereby improve collision outcome. There has been, however, no clear definition of the characteristics for lower load paths that improve vehicle safety and how these structures manifest themselves in proposed test procedures. FIMCAR has developed a vehicle crash test program that investigates the performance of vehicle structures using three different test series. The first test series used Super mini vehicles with different front end architectures. These tests with, and without, geometric alignment allowed the effectiveness of a lower load path to be compared to a case without a lower load path. A second set of tests investigated the importance of lower load paths for SUV type vehicles where the main front structures may not align with the main structures in a collision partner, but a lower load path may offset the consequences of this initial misalignment. A final test series investigated how the lower load paths in higher SUV type vehicles influence safety in side impact conditions and thus identify potential side effects of a new assessment procedure. Results of the test program show that the presence of a lower load path contributes to a more robust performance of the vehicle. The rearward offset of a lower load path could be reviewed and used to quantify when a lower structure design can contribute to structural interaction in both frontal and side impact configurations...|$|R
40|$|Using our {{previous}} experience with <b>the</b> Mars Environmental <b>Compatibility</b> <b>Assessment</b> (MECA) electrometer, we have designed {{a new type}} of aerodynamic electrometer. The goal of the research was to measure the buildup of electrostatic surface charge on a stationary cylindrical insulator after windborne granular particles have collided with the insulator surface in a simulated dust storm. The experiments are performed inside a vacuum chamber. This allows the atmospheric composition and pressure to be controlled in order to simulate the atmospheric conditions near the equator on the Martian surface. An impeller fan was used to propel the dust particles at a cylindrically shaped insulator under low vacuum conditions. We tested the new electrometer in a 10 mbar CO 2 atmosphere by exposing two types of cylindrical insulators, Teflon (1. 9 cm diameter) and Fiberglass (2. 5 cm diameter), to a variety of windborne granular particulate materials. The granular materials tested were JSC Mars- 1 simulant, which is a mixture of coarse and fine (< 5 microns diameter) particle sizes, and some of the major mineral constituents of the Martian soil. The minerals included Ottawa sand (SiO 2), iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3), aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3) and magnesium oxide (MgO). We also constructed a MECA-like electrometer that contained an insulator capped planar electrode for measuring the amount of electrostatic charge produced by rubbing an insulator surface over Martian and lunar soil simulants. The results {{of this study indicate that}} it is possible to detect triboelectric charging of insulator surfaces by windborne Martian soil simulant, and by individual mineral constituents of the soil simulant. We have also found that Teflon and Fiberglass insulator surfaces respond in different ways by developing opposite polarity surface charge, which decays at different rates after the particle impacts cease...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> Mars Environmental <b>Compatibility</b> <b>Assessment</b> (MECA) {{electrometer}} is {{an instrument}} that was designed jointly {{by researchers at the}} Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Kennedy Space Center, and is intended to fly on a future space exploration mission of the surface of Mars. The electrometer was designed primarily to study (1) the electrostatic interaction between the Martian soil and five different types of insulators, which are attached to the electrometer, as the electrometer is rubbed over the Martian soil. The MECA/Electrometer is also capable of measuring (2) the presence of charged particles in the Martian atmosphere, (3) the local electric field strength, and (4) the local temperature. The goal of the research project described in this report was to test and evaluate the measurement capabilities of the MECA/Electrometer under simulated Martian surface conditions using facilities located in the Labs and Testbeds Division at the Kennedy Space Center. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the Martian soil simulant can triboelectrically charge up the insulator surface. However, the maximum charge buildup did not exceed 18 % of the electrometer's full-range sensitivity when rubbed vigorously, and is more likely to be as low as 1 % of the maximum range when rubbed through soil. This indicates that the overall gain of the MECA/Electrometer could be increased by a factor of 50 if measurements at the 50 % level of full-range sensitivity are desired. The ion gauge, which detects the presence of charged particles, was also evaluated over a pressure range from 10 to 400 Torr (13 to 533 mbar). The electric field sensor was also evaluated. Although the temperature sensor was not evaluated due to project time constraints, it was previously reported to work properly...|$|R
