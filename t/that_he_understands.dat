Lisa refuses the money and rips up the cheque. This causes Homer to have four simultaneous heart attacks. While in the hospital, Lisa apologizes to Homer for not accepting the money. He tells her <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> what she did, but says that the $12,000 would have been a big financial help. Lisa replies that 10% of $120 million is actually $12 million. The hospital's public address system announces a code blue, signifying that Homer has entered cardiac arrest.|$|E

Before the operation, Rex's doctor suggests that Bree may have been poisoning him, citing their marital issues as a possible motive. Rex writes a note informing Bree <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> and forgives her and dies soon after. During Carlos's trial, John informs Carlos that he had been having an affair with Gabrielle, sending Carlos into a violent outburst in the courthouse. Elsewhere, Lynette learns that Tom has quit his job as a result of Lynette's betrayal. He then decides that she will go back to work and he will be a stay-at-home father.|$|E

25|$|That Heidegger did {{not write}} this second part of Being and Time, and that the existential {{analytic}} was {{left behind in the}} course of Heidegger's subsequent writings on the history of being, might be interpreted as a failure to conjugate his account of individual experience with his account of the vicissitudes of the collective human adventure <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> the Western philosophical tradition to be. And this would in turn raise the question of whether this failure is due to a flaw in Heidegger's account of temporality, that is, of whether Heidegger was correct to oppose vulgar and authentic time. There are also recent critiques in this regard that were directed at Heidegger's focus on time instead of primarily thinking about being in relation to place and space, and to the notion of dwelling, with connections too to architectural theory as impacted by phenomenology.|$|E
25|$|In {{the myth}} of Inanna's descent, Inanna, in order to console her grieving sister Ereshkigal, who is {{mourning}} {{the death of her}} husband Gugalana (gu, bull, gal, big, ana, sky/heaven), slain by Gilgamesh and Enkidu, sets out to visit her sister. She tells her servant Ninshubur (Lady Evening), a reference to Inanna's role as the evening star, that if she does not return in three days, to get help from her father Anu, Enlil, king of the gods, or Enki. When she does not return, Ninshubur approaches Anu only to be told <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> that his daughter is strong and can take care of herself. Enlil tells Ninshubur he is much too busy running the cosmos. Enki immediately expresses concern and dispatches his Galla demons, Galaturra or Kurgarra, sexless beings created from the dirt from beneath the god's finger-nails, to recover the young goddess. These beings may be the origin of the Greco-Roman Galli, androgynous beings of the third sex, similar to the American Indian berdache, who played an important part in early religious ritual.|$|E
500|$|Favorable {{reviews of}} Eragon often {{focused on the}} book's {{characters}} and plot. IGN's Matt Casamassina called the book [...] "entertaining", and added that [...] "Paolini demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> how to hold the reader's eyes {{and this is what}} ultimately separates Eragon from countless other me-too fantasy novels." [...] Chris Lawrence of About.com thought the book had all the [...] "traditional ingredients" [...] that make a fantasy novel [...] "enjoyable". The book was a [...] "fun read" [...] for him because it is [...] "quick and exciting" [...] and [...] "packed" [...] with action and magic.

They accepted and made him producer for the album because of the immediate rapport that developed between the two parties.

500|$|Michael is {{initially}} {{worked up about}} China after reading an article in Newsweek, an American weekly news magazine. Michael notes that {{he was forced to}} read Newsweek in the waiting room at his dentist's office because some [...] "kid had the magazine I wanted to read", hinting that the magazine Michael wanted to read was the children's magazine Highlights for Children. Andy sends Darryl a text that only reads [...] "Megan Fox", a reference to the actress. Creed notes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understands,</b> but cannot speak, Pirate slang. Andy attempts to motivate Michael with a pep talk taken from the 1979 movie Rocky II. During Michael and Oscar's discussion {{in the lobby of the}} office building, a copy of Call of Duty can be seen behind the counter. Fans have speculated that this may be a reference to the third season episode [...] "The Coup", which used the game as a plot device.|$|E

When the show wants to give Jim, or Pam, or Dwight, or now Andy a quiet, emotional moment, it's usually still able to do so very well, and that includes most of Andy and Darryl's interaction here in 'Lotto. He was, however, more critical of the episode's humor, noting that many of gags had been done before. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt called the episode superior to the previous episode commenting that [...] "While perhaps not monumentally better than last week's outing and damaged by a weak B-story, 'Lotto' had a greater sense of purpose that holds greater value to the season as it moves forward". He also complimented the writers for not focusing too much on Andy. He ultimately gave the episode a [...] "B".|$|E

500|$|A further {{charter of}} Alan Durward is dated 1250 [...] announces {{that he has}} granted to the {{brothers}} of the hospital at Kincardine O'Neil two davachs of land called Sudluyth and Kincardine O'Neil (together with two lands within the davach of Kincardine O'Neil, called Pathkellok and Garslogay). An interpretation of the text is that Alan Durward {{is the founder of}} the hospital, and the boundaries of the lands are described in detail, mainly by reference to streams. It also mentions that with the consent of Bishop Peter of Aberdeen and the Cathedral chapter the hospital has received a grant of the church of Kincardine O'Neil with all its pertinents, and two acres containing the church of Lumphanan, with the right of patronage and its chapel of Forthery. These grants are apparently made in return {{for the establishment of a}} chantry for the salvation of Alan himself, his forebears and heirs. Alan undertakes a forinsec service to the King for these lands, for which the remainder of his land of O'Neil is to answer in perpetuity. He also prescribes brief rules for replacing the brothers and the master of the hospital (leaving it largely to them, but subject to subsequent presentation to himself for his heirs). The document is sealed at Inverurie. A subscription by Alexander, Bishop of Aberdeen, in 1330 on the creation of a cathedral prebend, states <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> none of the above to have been vitiated or abolished ('non viciatam nec in aliqua sui parte abolitam').|$|E
500|$|Max is an {{anthropomorphic}} [...] "hyperkinetic, three-foot rabbity thing" [...] {{with white}} fur, but prefers {{being called a}} lagomorph. Max retains few characteristics consistent with a rabbit, with permanently rigid ears set in an excited posture and a huge jaw normally stuck in a crazed grin. Unhinged, uninhibited and near psychotic, Max enjoys violence and tends to prefer the aggressive way of solving problems, seeing the world {{as little more than}} a vessel for his [...] "pinball-like stream of consciousness". This creates a seeming disregard for self-preservation; Max will revel in dangerous situations with little impression <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> the risks he faces. As a result, Max is usually enthusiastic to engage in any activity, including being used by Sam as a cable cutter or an impromptu bludgeon. Despite this, Max possesses a sharp mind and an observational nature, and enjoys interpreting new experiences in as unpredictable manner as possible. However, Max has a distaste for long stories and occasionally loses focus during lengthy scenes of plot exposition; by his own admission, Max possesses a particularly short attention span. Despite his seemingly heartless personality, he believes strongly in protecting Sam. However, Max can still act violently towards his friend, stating that when he dies he will take Sam with him. Moreover, Max is extremely possessive of Sam and their status as partners and best friends. Max traditionally carries a Luger pistol, but as he wears no clothes, other characters often make comments as to where Max keeps it on his person. Purcell considers Max to be representative of pure id, the uncoordinated instinctual trends of the human psyche.|$|E

He goes {{to the top of a}} hill {{overlooking}} the city, while a dog appears from behind a bush and barks at him. Michael notices human flesh in him, and goes to investigate, where he finds a corpse sitting against a tree. Michael goes to the police station, and shows Captain Harper similar cases starting in 1999. In each case, a killer, nicknamed Gemini (Salvator Xuereb), vertically slashed the victim's wrists and carved a Roman numeral in their chests. The murders have taken place all across the United States, but everyone believes that Gemini is dead after an FBI agent Elizabeth Santoro (Megan Dodds) had shot him. Michael wants to cover the area as much as they can and Captain Tricia Harper (Laura Innes) agrees, telling Michael to pick up the profiler that the FBI has sent. Michael goes to Brentwood and meets with FBI agent Elizabeth Santoro. They discuss his history and she admits that she has been focused solely on the [...] "Gemini Killer" [...] for the last 12 years. Michael confirms that they did not find one on the body, so she figures that it is a copycat. Michael goes to the crime scene, while Bird is already there. The partners go over the hillside and find the dog. They take him to Dr. Banks (Chris McGarry) and have him check his stomach, where he finds a United States two-dollar bill in it. When Michael takes the evidence to Harper and Santoro, Santoro insists that it only means that someone with classified information to the case is involved. She suggests they check anyone who has recently laid off law enforcement officers with psych problems. Bird and Santoro create a database if the killer is alive. Santoro lets Harper decide and she tells the detectives to pull the files on law officers. As Santoro leaves, Michael approaches her and says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> the implications if the man she shot was Gemini. Meanwhile, the killer prepares a set of medical tools, a wad of two-dollar bills, and a syringe.|$|E
