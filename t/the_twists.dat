25|$|The {{official}} {{cause of}} the Sultana disaster {{was determined to be}} mismanagement of water levels in the boiler, exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} vessel was severely overcrowded and top heavy. As the steamboat made her way north following <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> and turns of the river, she listed severely to one side then the other. Her four boilers were interconnected and mounted side-by-side, so that if the boat tipped sideways, water would tend to run out of the highest boiler. With the fires still going against the empty boiler, this created hot spots. When the boat tipped the other way, water rushing back into the empty boiler would hit the hot spots and flash instantly to steam, creating a sudden surge in pressure. This effect of careening could have been minimized by maintaining high water levels in the boilers. The official inquiry found that the boat's boilers exploded due to the combined effects of careening, low water level, and a faulty repair to a leaky boiler made a few days earlier.|$|E

40|$|Let E be a flat complex vector bundle over {{a closed}} {{oriented}} odd dimensional manifold M endowed {{with a flat}} connection ∇. The refined analytic torsion for (M,E) was defined and studied by Braverman and Kappeler. Recently Mathai and Wu defined and studied the analytic torsion for <b>the</b> <b>twisted</b> de Rham complex with an odd degree closed differential form H, other than one form, as a flux and with coefficients in E. In this paper we generalize {{the construction of the}} refined analytic torsion to <b>the</b> <b>twisted</b> de Rham complex. We show that the refined analytic torsion of <b>the</b> <b>twisted</b> de Rham complex is independent of the choice of the Riemannian metric on M and the Hermitian metric on E. We also show that <b>the</b> <b>twisted</b> refined analytic torsion is invariant (under a natural identification) if H is deformed within its cohomology class. We prove a duality theorem, establishing a relationship between <b>the</b> <b>twisted</b> refined analytic torsion corresponding to a flat connection and its dual. We also define <b>the</b> <b>twisted</b> analogue of <b>the</b> Ray-Singer metric and calculate <b>the</b> <b>twisted</b> Ray-Singer metric of <b>the</b> <b>twisted</b> refined analytic torsion.

500|$|Among {{non-traditional}} productions, [...] Luca Ronconi, in 1996 at La Scala, used distorted and fractured scenery {{to represent}} <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> of fate {{reflected in the}} plot. Jonathan Miller, in a 1986 production for the 49th Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, transferred the action to Nazi-occupied Rome in 1944, with Scarpia {{as head of the}} fascist police. In Philipp Himmelmann's production on the Lake Stage at the Bregenz Festival in 2007 the act 1 set, designed by Johannes Leiacker, was dominated by a huge Orwellian [...] "Big Brother" [...] eye. The iris opens and closes to reveal surreal scenes beyond the action. This production updates the story to a modern Mafia scenario, with special effects [...] "worthy of a Bond film".|$|E
500|$|Frankenstein, {{like much}} Gothic fiction of the period, mixes a [...] and alienating subject matter with {{speculative}} and thought-provoking themes. Rather {{than focusing on}} <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> and turns of the plot, however, the novel foregrounds the mental and moral struggles of the protagonist, Victor Frankenstein, and Shelley imbues the text with her own brand of politicised Romanticism, one that criticised the individualism and egotism of traditional Romanticism. Victor Frankenstein is like Satan in Paradise Lost, and Prometheus: he rebels against tradition; he creates life; and he shapes his own destiny. These traits are not portrayed positively; as Blumberg writes, [...] "his relentless ambition is a self-delusion, clothed as quest for truth". He must abandon his family to fulfill his ambition.|$|E
500|$|Bennion commended the writing, {{saying that}} Pemberton and Shearsmith {{were able to}} subvert {{expectations}} of séances several times; [...] "just as you're smugly congratulating yourself for working out every twist and turn, they pull it from your grasp". Owen praised the writing and subversion of expectations, and, though he found some of <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> predictable and felt that the ending needed more groundwork, felt that the final sequence [...] "was worth it for another brown-trouser moment". Bennion felt that the [...] "genius" [...] of the episode was the way that tension was [...] "undercut" [...] with humour, but felt that the humour actually served to raise the tension. He highlighted the joke involving blue paint as particularly funny. Patrick Mulkern, of Radio Times, also praised the mix of humour and horror.|$|E

500|$|Sonnets are {{particularly}} {{associated with high}} poetic diction, vivid imagery, and romantic love, {{largely due to the}} influence of Petrarch as well as of early English practitioners such as Edmund Spenser (who gave his name to the Spenserian sonnet), Michael Drayton, and Shakespeare, whose sonnets are among the most famous in English poetry, with twenty being included in the Oxford Book of English Verse. However, <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> and turns associated with the volta allow for a logical flexibility applicable to many subjects. Poets from the earliest centuries of the sonnet to the present have utilized the form to address topics related to politics (John Milton, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Claude McKay), theology (John Donne, Gerard Manley Hopkins), war (Wilfred Owen, e. e. cummings), and gender and sexuality (Carol Ann Duffy). Further, postmodern authors such as Ted Berrigan and John Berryman have challenged the traditional definitions of the sonnet form, rendering entire sequences of [...] "sonnets" [...] that often lack rhyme, a clear logical progression, or even a consistent count of fourteen lines.|$|E

Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that the [...] "tone change" [...] in the episode was [...] "a bit abrupt", but noted that [...] "viewers who can handle <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> and turns will be intrigued".

James Poniewozik of Time magazine strongly praised [...] "Li'l Sebastian", and called {{it one of the}} best episodes of the season. He said Li'l Sebastian's funeral brought out the best in the characters, and that the episode [...] "combined slapstick, authentic stakes and a holistic picture of the oddball history and commonalities that bond the folks we've come to know in Pawnee". Henry Hanks of CNN called it [...] "one of the funniest half-hours of any show this season", and compared the Li'l Sebastian funeral to the funeral scenes in the Mary Tyler Moore Show episode [...] "Chuckles Bites the Dust". The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow called the episode a [...] "triumphant exclamation point at the end of Parks and Recreations third season", and described every moment as [...] "uproariously funny".

500|$|The {{character}} was portrayed by Phillip Jeanmarie {{over the course}} of the series, while Valerie was played by two actors: Daphnée Duplaix (2004 to 2008) and Siena Goines (2007). Jeanmarie and Duplaix were both originally unaware of the story arcs planned for Vincent Clarkson while they performed the role. Jeanmarie had originally auditioned for the part of a peeping tom, which would be expanded into the character of Vincent. In a retrospective interview, he praised the soap's creator and head writer James E.

Jeanmarie stated that he enjoyed portraying the antagonist, and described Vincent as a [...] "surprising and challenging" [...] character to portray given <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> in his narrative. Reilly and the series' writing teams did not inform Jeanmarie about any of their intended developments until the read-through and the shooting of his scenes.

[...] Murray also said, [...] "Yet for all my griping, I was quite taken with {{the theme of this}} episode, and the motifs that writers Robert Chiappetta and Glen Whitman and director Joe Chappelle used to support it. From the tinfoil Peter Pan hats that Walter and Astrid wear to Tyler popping the medication that grants him his powers out of a Pez dispenser, there's a lot in 'Of Human Action' about childish things." [...] Ramsey Isler from IGN graded the episode 8.0/10, explaining that despite it being a [...] "standalone" [...] episode, it was [...] "a high-intensity, action-filled tale that kept the adrenaline flowing.

Also positive was Chanel Reeder of Newsarama, who believed Fringe [...] "totally deliver in its most recent episode. <b>The</b> <b>twists</b> are back, along with the dramatic high intensity moments that the show is known for."
