5|$|The {{pollution}} {{issue is}} a main concern of citizens of Calhoun County, and has attracted demonstrations against industry in Point Comfort. However, Alcoa has worked with state and federal officials, spending $110million {{to reduce the size}} of <b>the</b> <b>superfund</b> site, as part of a 2005 settlement. Cooperation aims to create 70 additional acres of salt marsh and 11 acres of oyster reef habitat.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency {{added the}} Basin mining area to <b>the</b> <b>Superfund</b> National Priorities List because of mining-waste {{problems}} in and near town. The mining area comprised the watersheds of Basin and Cataract Creek {{and part of}} the Boulder River. Contaminants included arsenic, copper, cadmium, lead and other metals. Cleanup of the mining wastes at the Buckeye-Enterprise, Crystal and Bullion mines in the Basin Creek and Cataract watersheds was completed in 2002, and the removal of mine waste from Basin was completed in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Superfund {{sites are}} {{designated}} as {{being among the}} nation's worst areas with respect to toxic and hazardous waste. The Environmental Protection Agency is the federal agency that determines if a particular site is hazardous, prepares {{a course of action}} to reduce the hazard, and finds the parties responsible for the pollution. If a site is listed with <b>the</b> <b>Superfund</b> program, federal dollars are available for cleanup.|$|E
25|$|Tissue residue {{guidelines}} were developed for tributyltin (TBT) for <b>the</b> Harbor Island <b>Superfund</b> site, Lower Duwamish <b>Superfund</b> site and <b>the</b> Portland Harbor <b>Superfund</b> site.

Tissue residue toxicity reference value (TRV) was developed for TBT regarding mortality and growth at <b>the</b> Lower Duwamish <b>Superfund</b> site.

5|$|Industry {{is heavy}} along the bay, with an {{abundance}} of natural gas and oil wells at all corners. Natural gas was discovered at the site in 1934, and oil was discovered the next year. Point Comfort is home to several industrial plants along the shore, including Alcoa, Union Carbide, Du Pont, and Formosa Plastics Corp, which contribute to the local economies. Despite the restrictions on the bay that prevent the production of fish and shellfish along <b>the</b> <b>superfund</b> site, seafood harvesting is a major industry. However, it is not as prominent {{as it was in the}} 1920s, when Port Lavaca led the nation in shrimp production, leading to the construction of a quick-freezing plant. Today, shrimping is only allowed south of the Port Lavaca Causeway, due to the north's classification as a nursery location. Shellfish production is allowed in Keller Bay and Lavaca Bay south of Point Comfort, but is restricted along the eastern and northern coast and Chocolate Bay, and is conditionally approved in the remaining locations, including along the shore of Port Lavaca. A small tourism industry also fuels economic growth, spurred by the Port Lavaca State Fishing Pier found alongside the Port Lavaca Causeway. The pier once served as the causeway across the bay but was replaced in the 1960s and converted into a fishing pier of , billed as the longest in the world.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, federal {{officials}} announced that <b>the</b> <b>superfund</b> cleanup has ended, although the actual cleanup ended years earlier. The entire process took 21 years and $400 million. About 260 homes {{north of the}} canal have been renovated and sold to new owners, and about 150 acres east of the canal have been sold to commercial developers for light industrial uses.

50|$|The {{concentration}} of manganese in Saint Johns Creek above one of <b>the</b> former <b>superfund</b> sites {{on it was}} 38 parts per million in 1985.

25|$|Originally {{intended}} as a model planned community, Love Canal served as a residential area before being purchased by Hooker Chemical Company, now Occidental Chemical Corporation. After its sale to the local school district, Love Canal attracted national attention for the public health problem originated from the massive dumping of toxic waste on the grounds. This event displaced numerous families, leaving them with long-standing health issues and symptoms of high {{white blood cell counts}} and leukemia. Consequently, the federal government passed <b>the</b> <b>Superfund</b> law. The resulting cleanup operation under <b>the</b> <b>Superfund</b> law demolished the neighborhood, wrapping up in 2004.|$|E
25|$|A nonbinding {{allocation}} of responsibility (NBAR) is a device, established in <b>the</b> <b>Superfund</b> Amendments and Reauthorization Act, {{that allows the}} EPA to make a nonbinding estimate of the proportional share {{that each of the}} various responsible parties at a Superfund site should pay toward the costs of cleanup.|$|E

25|$|Starting in 1991, legal {{proceedings}} by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established the General Electric/Housatonic River Site. Initial cleanup work began in 1996 when EPA issued a unilateral order to GE {{that required the}} removal of highly contaminated sediments and bank soils. EPA added the site to <b>the</b> <b>Superfund</b> list in September 1997.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Superfund</b> Innovative Technology Evaluation (SITE) program {{supports}} {{development of}} technologies for assessing and treating waste at Superfund sites.

40|$|The {{cleanup of}} {{hazardous}} waste sites under <b>the</b> Federal <b>Superfund</b> program has received much attention since Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act in 1980. As Congress debates reauthorization and possible expansion of the program, it is instructive to examine the “lessons learned ” from <b>the</b> initial <b>Superfund</b> program. <b>The</b> objectives of this OTA study are, as requested by the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Science and Technology Committee: 1) to understand future Superfund needs and how permanent cleanups can be accomplished in a cost-effective manner for diverse types of sites; 2) to describe the interactions among many components of <b>the</b> complex <b>Superfund</b> system; and 3) to analyze the consequences of pursuing different strategies for implementing the program. The study brings together {{a great deal of}} information on what can be learned from <b>the</b> initial <b>Superfund</b> program in order to improve it. In particular, the study focuses on the choice between continuing and improving the current program and adopting a new strategy on the basis of improved information. Such a new strategy has been defined and analyzed by OTA in considerable detail to provide Congress with an understanding of critical policy trade-offs, As Congress and the Nation attempt to address major economic and budgetary issues, it i...|$|R

25|$|From 2000-2015, Congress {{allocated}} about $1.26 {{billion of}} general revenue to <b>the</b> <b>Superfund</b> program each year.

25|$|The most {{discussed}} {{pollution of}} the Hudson River is General Electric's {{contamination of the}} river with Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) between 1947 and 1977.
