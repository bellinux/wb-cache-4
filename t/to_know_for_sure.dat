Dr. Vucetich said that it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure,</b> but the Isle Royale wolves might have disappeared completely.

2500|$|After {{returning}} to the country in 1931, he was made editor of the PCdR's main gazette, [...] As later noted by researcher Victor Frunză, the PCdR's clandestine nature and inner struggles make it impossible <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> {{who was in charge}} of [...] by that moment in time.

Another fellow communist, Belu Zilber, later noted that Roller was already designated the PCdR historian, and promised an official post in the event of a communist takeover. Such historiographic ambitions prompt historian Adrian Cioroianu to call Roller a [...] "fantasizer" [...] in the field. According to political scientist Vladimir Tismăneanu, Roller was also one of the Jewish and Bessarabian [...] "déclassés" [...] who gained top PCdR positions in the Chișinevschi–Răutu faction, and in fact a staunch anti-intellectual.|$|E

The 40-year-old Illingworth was tired himself, took the advice of his bowlers and chose not to enforce the follow on, instead batting Australia out of the game. This caused great surprise to the pundits and old Test cricketers at the ground who felt that he had let Australia off the hook, This was a situation made for Geoff Boycott and ignoring the furore caused by his first innings he made 119 not out, making another century opening stand with John Edrich (40). Thomson (3-79) took three quick wickets to help reduce 103/0 to 151/4, but Ray Illingworth (48 not out) added 82 with Boycott before declaring on 233/4.|$|R

5000|$|There {{is another}} option: {{the belief that}} both ideals and [...] "reality" [...] exist. Dualists {{commonly}} argue that {{the distinction between the}} mind (or 'ideas') and matter can be proven by employing Leibniz' principle of the identity of indiscernibles which states that if two things share all exactly the same qualities, then they must be identical, as in indistinguishable from each other and therefore one and the same thing. Dualists then attempt to identify attributes of mind that are lacked by matter (such as privacy or intentionality) or vice versa (such as having a certain temperature or electrical charge). One notable application of the identity of indiscernibles was by René Descartes in his Meditations on First Philosophy. Descartes concluded that he could not doubt the existence of himself (the famous cogito ergo sum argument), but that he could doubt the (separate) existence of his body. From this, he inferred that the person Descartes must not be identical to the Descartes body since one possessed a characteristic that the other did not: namely, it could be <b>known</b> <b>to</b> exist. Solipsism agrees with Descartes in this aspect, and goes further: only things that can be <b>known</b> <b>to</b> exist <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> should be considered to exist. The Descartes body could only exist as an idea {{in the mind of the}} person Descartes. Descartes and dualism aim to prove the actual existence of reality as opposed to a phantom existence (as well as the existence of God in Descartes' case), using the realm of ideas merely as a starting point, but solipsism usually finds those further arguments unconvincing. The solipsist instead proposes that his/her own unconscious is the author of all seemingly [...] "external" [...] events from [...] "reality".|$|R
