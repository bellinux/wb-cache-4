5|$|Frequency scaling was the {{dominant}} reason for improvements in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004. The runtime {{of a program}} {{is equal to the}} number of instructions multiplied by the average time per instruction. Maintaining everything else constant, increasing the clock frequency decreases the average <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> execute an instruction. An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime for all compute-bound programs.|$|E
5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation: it rotates {{about its}} axis {{in about the}} same <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> orbit Earth. This results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards Earth. However, due {{to the effect of}} libration, about 59% of the Moon's surface can actually be seen from Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{gravitational}} attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth. The {{same effect}} on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period {{is the same as}} the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminator.|$|E

Symantec funded the benchmark test and provided scripts used to benchmark each participating antivirus software. Tests {{were conducted in}} Windows Vista running on a dual core processor. PC Magazine found the suite added 15 seconds to the boot time, with a baseline of 60 seconds.

5|$|Tesla Motors {{designed}} its Model S {{to allow}} fast battery swapping. In June 2013, Tesla announced their goal to deploy a battery swapping station {{in each of}} its supercharging stations. At a demonstration event Tesla showed that a battery swap operation with the Model S takes just over 90 seconds, about half the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> refill a gasoline-powered car used for comparison purposes during the event. The first stations are planned to be deployed along Interstate 5 in California where, according to Tesla, {{a large number of}} Model S sedans make the San Francisco-Los Angeles trip regularly. These will be followed by the Washington, DC to Boston corridor.|$|E
5|$|Protein folding {{does not}} occur in one step. Instead, {{proteins}} {{spend most of their}} folding time, nearly 96% in some cases, waiting in various intermediate conformational states, each a local thermodynamic free energy minimum in the protein's energy landscape. Through a process known as adaptive sampling, these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a set of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a Markov state model (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are discrete-time master equation models which describe a biomolecule's conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov state model method significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on GPUGRID) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories. The amount of <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> construct a Markov state model is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run, i.e., the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear parallelization, leading to an approximately four orders of magnitude reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein's phase space (all the conformations a protein can take on) and the transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e., routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a coarse-grained representation of the otherwise highly detailed model. They can use these MSMs to reveal how proteins misfold and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments.|$|E

50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1990s, OSI started to package {{applications}} to help reduce the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> develop adapters.

A policy framework called Distributed Management Policies (DMP) introduced after the year 2000 added automation to the existing NetExpert framework.
