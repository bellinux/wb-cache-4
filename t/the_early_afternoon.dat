5|$|The afternoon, {{especially}} <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoon,</b> {{is associated}} with a dip in a variety of areas of human cognitive and productive functioning. Notably, motor vehicle accidents occur more frequently in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoon,</b> when drivers presumably have recently finished lunch. A study of motor accidents in Sweden between 1987 and 1991 found that the time around 5 pm had by far the most accidents: around 1,600 at 5 pm compared to around 1,000 each at 4 pm and 6 pm. This trend may have been influenced by the afternoon rush hour, but the morning rush hour showed a much smaller increase. In Finland, accidents in the agriculture industry are most common in the afternoon, specifically Monday afternoons in September.|$|E
5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoon</b> hours, forecasters at {{both the}} SPC and the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Norman, Oklahoma, {{realized}} that a major event was likely to take place based solely on observational data from radar and weather satellite imagery and balloon soundings, as the computer models remained uncooperative in helping meteorologists determine where the greatest threat of severe storms would occur.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoon</b> Burke and McDougal {{pleaded not}} guilty to the murder of Docherty. The first {{witnesses}} were then called from a list of 55 that included Hare and Knox; not all the witnesses on the list were called and Knox, with three of his assistants, avoided being questioned in court. One of Knox's assistants, David Paterson—who had been the main person Burke and Hare had dealt with at Knox's surgery—was called and confirmed the pair had supplied the doctor with several corpses.|$|E

5|$|On 25 May 2015, {{all three}} Queens met, once again, at Liverpool, {{in order to}} {{celebrate}} the 175th anniversary of the shipping line. After arriving at Liverpool the previous day, Queen Mary 2 made a brief excursion {{to the entrance of}} the River Mersey to welcome her two fleetmates into port in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoon.</b> The three Cunarders then sailed, in formation, towards Liverpool. The ships spent several hours together, before the departure of Queen Mary 2 to Saint Peter Port, Guernsey.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoon</b> of 3 April, Moore {{considered}} {{conducting a}} further raid on Kaafjord the next day. He decided against doing {{so as the}} preliminary assessment of photos taken during the attack had concluded that Tirpitz was badly damaged. Moore was also aware that his aircrew were fatigued, and was reluctant to expose them to what would now be alert defences. Accordingly, he ordered that the fleet return to base, and it arrived at Scapa Flow in the afternoon of 6 April. King George VI and Prime Minister Winston Churchill sent congratulatory messages to the fleet, but both Churchill and Cunningham were concerned that Tirpitz could be returned to service. Cunningham also regretted Moore's decision not to launch a further strike on 4 April.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the {{regiment}} undertook basic training including weapons handling, ceremonial drill, mounted and dismounted tactics and regimental manoeuvres. In late April, they marched through {{the centre of}} Sydney {{as part of a}} farewell before deploying overseas. On 11 June, after the brigade had concentrated, {{the regiment}} embarked upon the troopship SS Suevic. After four days steaming, the ship put into Adelaide, South Australia, where the regiment disembarked their horses due to concerns about death rates among horses travelling at that time of year. The men continued on their journey three days later, undertaking rifle and signals training on deck during the day. They crossed the equator in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoon</b> on 5 July; a short time later an epidemic of measles broke out.|$|E
50|$|While {{living in}} New York City, Cheng often spent several hours in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoons</b> {{studying}} or teaching classes {{of three or}} four students in the C. V. Starr East Asian Library in Columbia University, usually in a small, mahogany-panelled loft above the main floor. For relaxation, he raised orchids.|$|R
50|$|Following the war, For the Children recommenced on Sunday 7 July 1946, with a twenty-minute slot every Sunday {{afternoon}} {{and the addition}} of programmes for pre-school children under the banner For The Very Young, and over the years they became an established feature of <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoons</b> on <b>the</b> BBC's main channel BBC One.|$|R

5|$|In Pennsylvania, Governor Ed Rendell {{declared}} a disaster emergency {{across the entire}} state on the 15th. PPL Electric Utilities Corporation reported 1,542 customers were without power for a time during the storm in the Lancaster, Harrisburg and Allentown areas. Snow began across between 6 AM and 7 AM EST on the 13th in Philadelphia, Delaware, Chester, Montgomery and Berks counties. The snow then overspread Bucks, Northampton, Lehigh, Carbon, Berks, and most of Schuylkill counties between 8 AM and 10 AM EST, but held off in Monroe County until <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoon</b> hours. There was a lull in the precipitation during the evening hours of the 13th especially across southeastern Pennsylvania, however the precipitation became widespread overnight and during {{the early morning hours}} of the 14th.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoon,</b> an eye feature {{began to}} form; subsequently, Hernan was nearing {{hurricane}} status. However, by the nighttime hours, a microwave satellite {{found that the}} center of Hernan was located to the west-southwest of the eye feature, and the intensification ceased {{for the rest of}} the day and into the morning of August 8. Later in the morning, the center of Hernan was determined to be located underneath the eye and was determined to have become a hurricane, the fifth of the season, during the afternoon of August 8. Throughout the day, the eye became better defined, indicating that moderate northeasterly wind shear had already begun to diminish. Despite a cloud-filled eye, meteorologists showed Hernan peaking as a category 2 hurricane overnight.|$|E
5|$|In the lead-up to {{the opening}} night, the station promised at least two movies a week, as well as men's {{interest}} programs each Saturday afternoon between 3pm and 4pm – a commitment successfully met, along with female-targeted programming in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoon,</b> and children's programming from 4.30pm to 6.30pm weekdays and mature programming thirty minutes before closedown each night.

5|$|On 17 July the Soviet Southwestern and Southern Fronts {{launched}} a major offensive across the Mius and Donets Rivers against the southern wing of Army Group South, pressing upon the 6th Army and 1st Panzer Army. In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoon</b> of 17 July, Operation Roland was terminated with {{an order for}} the II SS-Panzer Corps to begin withdrawing from the Prokhorovka sector back to Belgorod. The 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf anticipated the order and began executing it {{as early as the}} evening of 16 July. Leibstandartes tanks were distributed between Das Reich and Totenkopf, and the division was hastily redeployed to Italy, while Das Reich and Totenkopf were dispatched south to meet the new Soviet offensives.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} of the day between noon and evening. It {{is the time}} when the sun is {{descending}} from its zenith in the sky to somewhat before its terminus at the horizon in the west direction. In human life, it occupies roughly {{the latter half of the}} standard work and school day. It is also associated with a number of concerns related to health, safety, and economic productivity: generally, <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoon,</b> after most people have eaten lunch, corresponds to decreased work performance, decreased alertness, and a higher incidence of motor vehicle accidents. It is usually from 12 PM to 6 PM, but during winter it may be from 12 PM to 4 PM and during summer it may be from 12 PM to 8 PM.|$|E
5|$|In diurnal animals, it {{is typical}} for {{blood levels of}} the hormone cortisol—which is used to {{increase}} blood sugar and aid metabolism and is also produced in response to stress—to be most stable in the afternoon after decreasing throughout the morning. However, cortisol levels are also the most reactive to environmental changes unrelated to sleep and daylight during the afternoon. As a result, {{this time of day}} is considered optimal for researchers studying stress and hormone levels. Plants generally have their highest photosynthetic levels of the day at noon and in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoon,</b> owing to the sun's high angle in the sky. The large proliferation of maize crops across Earth has caused tiny, harmless fluctuations in the normal pattern of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, since these crops photosynthesize large amounts of carbon dioxide during these times and this process sharply drops down during the late afternoon and evening.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoon</b> of 1 November, {{a combat}} patrol from the US 5th Cavalry Regiment, rear guard of the 8th Cavalry Regiment, was intercepted by PVA 343rd Regiment of the 115th Division at Bugle Hill. With the trap discovered, the Chinese {{immediately}} launched their attacks at 17:00. Supported by rocket artillery, the 117th Division attacked the ROK 15th Infantry Regiment {{in full force}} while four Chinese battalions from the 116th Division struck {{the gap between the}} 1st and 2nd Battalions of the US 8th Cavalry Regiment. By 23:00, the heavy fighting destroyed the ROK 15th Infantry Regiment while the US 1st and 2nd Battalions were running out of ammunition. As the UN forces began to buckle around Unsan, Milburn finally ordered the garrison to withdraw after learning the destruction of the ROK 6th Infantry Division on the right flank.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July 1806, {{the small}} British brig HMS Rattlesnake under Commander John Bastard was {{cruising}} off the Southern {{coast of the}} British colony of Ceylon in search of French privateers that had been attacking small British traders, known as country ships, in the region. Most notorious of these was the Bellone, known to be operating in the area. In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoon,</b> lookouts on Rattlesnake spotted sails near the Little Basses Reef and approached the ship, which turned with the wind and fled to the southwest. Bastard immediately gave chase, and soon came close enough to identify the vessel as the Bellone. Although Bellone was {{much larger than the}} British warship, Captain Perroud was unwilling to risk his vessel in an unprofitable confrontation with Rattlesnake and seemed to be making an effective withdrawal when, at 15:15, a large ship came within sight directly ahead.|$|E
5|$|On May 5, the SPC {{issued a}} high risk of severe weather for Central Kansas and central Nebraska, while {{moderate}} and slight risks for severe weather extended for areas far beyond. The low pressure system in place moved northward, but the extending front had barely moved. The storms were quick to develop. Severe weather reports were already coming in by late morning, and the first tornado reports came in during <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoon</b> hours. The most intense activity took place during the late afternoon and evening hours as supercells developed along a long line from South Dakota to North Texas. Over 80 tornadoes were confirmed that day, along with hail as large as softballs and straightline winds as strong as 90mph (145km/h). The activity weakened in the late evening, but not before the last tornadoes were reported in Iowa in the overnight hours.|$|E

50|$|The central {{post office}} in Luxembourg {{received}} rumours {{of the strike}} in the morning, and received formal confirmation of <b>the</b> strike by <b>early</b> <b>afternoon,</b> which disrupted <b>the</b> distribution of mail that evening and the following day.|$|R
5|$|The first {{air attack}} {{was carried out}} by the Vildebeests of Nos. 36 and 100 Squadrons and the Hudsons of Nos. 1 and 8 Squadron RAAF. Twelve Vildebeests and nine Hudson bombers took off from Singapore in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoon</b> of January 26, with a fighter escort {{composed}} of twelve Brewster F2A Buffalos and nine Hawker Hurricanes. The Japanese landings on Endau had been in progress for over four hours by the time the planes arrived at 15:00. The Japanese naval force had air cover consisting of 19 Nakajima Ki-27s from the 1st and 11th Squadrons and a single Nakajima Ki-44 fighter. Despite heavy opposition, the two transports were bombed, and men and equipment on the beach were strafed. Five Vildebeests were lost in the attack, including the commanding officer of No. 100 Squadron, while one Ki-27 was shot down.|$|E
5|$|The first storm-related {{power outages}} {{took place in}} <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoon</b> on October 17 as weather {{conditions}} worsened. At {{the height of the}} storm, about 31,000 out of 36,000 electricity customers were without power, including the 1,500outages left unresolved after Fay. Backup CARILEC crews helped with specialty assignments, such as commercial outages and homes without power since before Gonzalo's onslaught. Service was not fully restored until November 3, and BELCO ultimately spent US$2.9million on system repairs after hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo. The company replaced 228utility poles, 80transformers, and over 4mi (6.5km) of wire. Other utilities, such as television and Internet services, also suffered, and technicians handled individual outages deep into the month of November. About 600streetlights on main roads and several hundred more on side-streets were inoperative following the hurricane; some remained unmended through January 2015.|$|E
5|$|Vitgeft {{made another}} attempt {{to break through the}} Japanese {{blockade}} on 10 August in accordance to a direct order from the Tsar. The squadron was spotted relatively quickly and the Japanese main fleet intercepted the Russians in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>afternoon.</b> During the Battle of the Yellow Sea, Poltava and Sevastopol were the last battleships in the Russian column and Poltava, which was slowed by engine problems, became the primary target of the Japanese battleships and armored cruisers when Vitgeft maneuvered the squadron past the Japanese and forced them into a stern chase. Shortly before sunset, a lucky hit killed Vitgeft and threw the squadron into confusion. The squadron second-in-command, Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky, eventually gained control of the squadron and led most of them back to Port Arthur. Poltava had been hit by 12–14 shells, eight or 12 inches in caliber, and suffered 12 killed and 43 wounded; Sevastopol was only hit by several shells that killed one crewman and wounded 62 men.|$|E
