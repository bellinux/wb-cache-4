5|$|Burial mounds {{in present-day}} Indian Mounds Park {{suggest that the}} area was {{originally}} inhabited by the Hopewell Native Americans about two thousand years ago. From the early 17th century until 1837, the Mdewakanton Dakota, a tribe of the Sioux, lived near the mounds after fleeing <b>their</b> <b>ancestral</b> home of Mille Lacs Lake from advancing Ojibwe. They called the area I-mni-za ska dan ("little white rock") for its exposed white sandstone cliffs.|$|E

5|$|Narendra's father's {{sudden death}} in 1884 left the family bankrupt; {{creditors}} began demanding the repayment of loans, and relatives threatened to evict the family from <b>their</b> <b>ancestral</b> home. Narendra, once {{a son of}} a well-to-do family, became one of the poorest students in his college. He unsuccessfully tried to find work and questioned God's existence, but found solace in Ramakrishna and his visits to Dakshineswar increased.|$|E
5|$|The House of Seljuk was {{a branch}} of the Kınık Oğuz Turks who resided on the {{periphery}} of the Muslim world, in the Yabgu Khaganate of the Oğuz confederacy, to the north of the Caspian and Aral Seas, in the 9th century. In the 10th century, the Seljuks started migrating from <b>their</b> <b>ancestral</b> homeland into Persia, which became the administrative core of the Great Seljuk Empire, after its foundation by Tughril.|$|E
5|$|After humans {{migrated}} out of <b>their</b> <b>ancestral</b> {{environment of}} eastern Africa, they {{were exposed to}} new climates and challenges. Thus, Wade argues, human evolution did not end with behavioural modernity, but continued to be shaped by the different environments and lifestyles of each continent. While many adaptations happened in parallel across human populations, Wade believes that genetic isolation – either because of geography or hostile tribalism – also facilitated a degree of independent evolution, leading to genetic and cultural differentiation from the ancestral population and giving rise to different human races and languages.|$|E

5|$|Ezra Manning Meeker {{was born}} in Butler County, Ohio, near Huntsville, on December 29, 1830, the son of Jacob (1804–1869) and Phoebe (Baker) Meeker (1801–1854). His {{paternal}} ancestors had been among the early settlers of Elizabeth, New Jersey, where <b>their</b> <b>ancestral</b> home was located. In the American Revolutionary War, about twenty Meekers fought for the new nation. Ezra was the fourth of the six children Jacob and Phoebe had together, with older brothers John, Manning (died at age one week) and Oliver, and a younger sister Hannah and brother Clark.|$|E
5|$|Rama Raghoba Rane {{was born}} on 26 June 1918 {{in the village of}} Haveri in the Dharwar {{district}} of Karnataka. He was the son of R. P. Rane, a police constable from Chendia village of North Kanara district in Karnataka. Rane's early education, mostly in district school, was chaotic due to his father's frequent transfers. In 1930, he became influenced by the Non-Cooperation Movement, which agitated for Indian independence from Great Britain. His involvement with the movement alarmed his father, who moved the family back to <b>their</b> <b>ancestral</b> village at Chendia.|$|E
5|$|Some {{suggested}} that the non-Malays did not feel loyal to Malaya {{because they did not}} consider themselves to be of Malayan nationality and adhere strictly to their own ethnic cultural backgrounds. To counter this, in 1952 citizenship was granted to nearly all local-born non-Malays, and dual citizenship prohibited, forcing non-Malays to choose between <b>their</b> <b>ancestral</b> homeland and Malaya. In contrast to the Malay's hypothesis, a majority of the non-Malays remained, thus proving their allegiance to Malaya. They are the ancestor of modern-day non-Malay Malaysian.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} known inhabitants {{from about}} 400 A.D. {{were members of}} the Hopewell tradition who buried their dead in mounds (now Indian Mounds Park) on the bluffs above the river. The next known inhabitants were the Mdewakanton Dakota in the 17th century who fled <b>their</b> <b>ancestral</b> home of Mille Lacs Lake in central Minnesota in response to westward expansion of the Ojibwe nation. The Ojibwe would later occupy the north (east) bank of the Mississippi River.|$|E
5|$|Thơ's {{government}} halted Nhu's Strategic Hamlet Program. Nhu had trumpeted {{the program}} as the solution to South Vietnam's difficulties with Việt Cộng insurgents, believing that the mass relocation of peasants into fortified villages would isolate the Viet Cong from their peasant support base. Thơ contradicted Nhu's earlier reports {{on the success of}} the program, claiming that only 20% of the 8,600 existing strategic hamlets were under Saigon's control, with the rest having been taken over by the communists. Those hamlets that were deemed to be tenable were consolidated, while the remainder were dismantled and their inhabitants returned to <b>their</b> <b>ancestral</b> land.|$|E
5|$|According to E. P. Sanders, {{the birth}} {{narratives}} in Matthew and Luke are the clearest case of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, {{in accordance with}} Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to <b>their</b> <b>ancestral</b> cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads {{as though it was}} invented to identify Jesus as like a new Moses, and the historian Josephus reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred little boys.|$|E
50|$|After {{the sale}} of the circus, he moved to Europe, where he lived in Switzerland and Belgium. In the early 1960s, North and his brother, Henry Ringling North, who had bought <b>their</b> father's <b>ancestral</b> home in County Galway, became Irish citizens.|$|R

5|$|Ashot III {{established}} the Kingdom of Lori (Tashir-Dzoraget Kingdom) in Gugark for strategic reasons and enthroned Gurgen in 982. Gurgen {{along with his}} brother Smbat are depicted on the sculptures of the patrons in both Sanahin and Haghpat. When the Tashir-Dzoraget kingdom fell {{as a result of}} Seljuk raids the Kyurikids migrated to Tavush and Metsnaberd yet they maintained ties with <b>their</b> <b>ancestral</b> fortress and compound in Akhtala. The fortress was built on an elevated rocky outcrop surrounded by deep canyons from three sides forming a natural protection. The somewhat accessible parts between the cliffs are reinforced by towers and walls. The only entrance to the compound is on the northern side protected by bell-shaped towers and walls. The walls and towers of the fortress are built of bluish basalt and lime mortar. The Kyurikids gradually lost their influence under the Seljuk grasp {{by the end of the}} 12th century.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war there were about 35,000 people who had been born in either Germany or Austria-Hungary living in Australia. Due to large-scale German migration in the late 19th century, there were also an inestimable number of people of German origin, many of whom maintained an affinity for <b>their</b> <b>ancestral</b> roots. Many of these were naturalised Australians, and indeed it is believed that many men of German origin enlisted in the AIF. However, due to concerns about the loyalties of some members of the German and Austrian communities, internment camps were set up where those suspected of unpatriotic acts were sent. In total it is believed that 4,500 people were interned under the provisions of the War Precautions Act, of which 700 were naturalised Australians and 70 Australian-born. Following the end of the war, 6,150 were deported.|$|E
5|$|He became {{active in}} an armed {{struggle}} against the Ottoman government and Kurdish irregulars in the late 1880s. Andranik joined the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktustyun) party and, along with other fedayi (militias), sought to defend the Armenian peasantry living in <b>their</b> <b>ancestral</b> homeland, an area known as Western (or Turkish) Armeniaat the time part of the Ottoman Empire. His revolutionary activities ceased and he left the Ottoman Empire after the unsuccessful uprising in Sasun in 1904. In 1907, Andranik left Dashnaktustyun because he disapproved of its cooperation with the Young Turks, a party which years later perpetrated the Armenian Genocide. Between 1912 and 1913, together with Garegin Nzhdeh, Andranik led a few hundred Armenian volunteers within the Bulgarian army against the Ottomans during the First Balkan War.|$|E

5|$|Ivan Bagramyan {{was born}} to Armenian parents {{in the village of}} Chardakhlu, near Yelizavetpol (modern Ganja, Azerbaijan), then a part of the Russian Empire. Chardakhlu was one of the largest Armenian {{settlements}} in the South Caucasus populated almost entirely by migrants from the village of Maghavuz in Nagorno Karabakh who continued keeping a connection with <b>their</b> <b>ancestral</b> land. Hamazasp Babadzhanian, a fellow Armenian who was to become the chief marshal of the Soviet Armor corps, was born in the same village. While Bagramyan's father, Khachatur, went to work all day at the railway station in Yelizavetpol, his mother, Mariam, stayed at home {{to take care of her}} seven children. Because his parents could not afford to send him to the local gymnasium, they decided to enroll him at a recently opened two-year school in Yelizavetpol.|$|E
5|$|On 11 September 1926, Shamrock Rovers {{played their}} first game at Glenmalure Park, Milltown against Dundalk, having {{previously}} played at Ringsend Park, Shelbourne Park, Windy Arbour {{and a different}} pitch behind the famous Milltown one. The official opening took place on Sunday, 19 September 1926 as Belfast Celtic provided the opposition in an exhibition game. When the Cunninghams acquired the club in the 1930s, the stadium was named Glenmalure Park in honour of <b>their</b> <b>ancestral</b> home in Glenmalure. They completed the stadium {{with the addition of}} terraces, one of which was covered. The stadium remained essentially unaltered from then until its demolition in 1990, excluding the destruction of a small terrace and the erection of floodlights in the 1980s. Its capacity was approximately 20,000 for most of its existence, its largest recorded attendance being 28,000, set against Waterford in 1968. Larger, unreported, attendances were present at the venue before then.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary {{with the beginning of}} the Bronze Age in the late 4th millennium BC. The Sumerian archaic cuneiform script and the Egyptian hieroglyphs are generally considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of <b>their</b> <b>ancestral</b> proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with the earliest coherent texts from about 2600 BC. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of cultural diffusion. A similar debate exists for the Chinese script, which developed around 1200 BC. The pre-Columbian Mesoamerican writing systems (including among others Olmec and Maya scripts) are generally believed to have had independent origins.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} Americans of Scottish descent today is {{estimated}} to be 20 to 25 million (up to 8.3% of the total US population), and Scotch-Irish, 27 to 30 million (up to 10% of the total US population), the subgroups overlapping and not always distinguishable because of <b>their</b> shared <b>ancestral</b> surnames.|$|R
