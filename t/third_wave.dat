5|$|Everything in Time (B-sides, Rarities, Remixes) is a {{compilation}} album comprising B-sides, remixes, and rare songs by the American <b>third</b> <b>wave</b> ska band No Doubt, first released on November 23, 2003 as disc three of No Doubt's box set, Boom Box, which also contained The Singles 1992–2003, The Videos 1992–2003 and Live in the Tragic Kingdom. Everything in Time was later released separately on October 12, 2004.|$|E
5|$|Tragic Kingdom uses {{elements}} {{of a variety of}} musical genres. <b>Third</b> <b>wave</b> ska and ska punk (a fusion of ska and punk rock) are the genres most prominent on the album. The album also uses {{elements of}} new wave, pop, and post-grunge, and dance rhythms influenced by reggae, ska, flamenco, and Tejano, among others. Apart from No Doubt's instrumentation, the album uses horn sections on several songs.|$|E
5|$|Two further {{attacks were}} made on Belgrade by the Germans {{on the first day}} of the invasion. The <b>third</b> <b>wave</b> struck at 14:00, {{consisting}} of 94 twin-engined bombers flying from airfields near Vienna, escorted by 60 fighters. This attack was confronted by eighteen fighters of the 6th Fighter Regiment, who claimed four German aircraft shot down. The fourth attack of the day approached Belgrade at 16:00, comprising 97 dive bombers and 60 fighters.|$|E

50|$|Eventually, three beachheads were {{established}} at Patoniemi, Volossula, and Kelja. Finnish artillery {{was able to}} repel the second and <b>third</b> <b>waves</b> of reinforcements, however a battalion had already landed {{at each of the}} three beachheads.|$|R
5000|$|MS Louis Majesty (Mediterranean Sea, March 2010) {{was struck}} by three {{successive}} 8 m waves while crossing the Gulf of Lion on a Mediterranean cruise between Cartagena and Marseille. Two passengers were killed by flying glass when a lounge window was shattered by the second and <b>third</b> <b>waves.</b> The waves, which struck without warning, were all abnormally high in respect to the sea swell {{at the time of}} the incident.|$|R
5|$|Each {{soldier in}} the first two waves had been issued a total of 200 rounds of {{ammunition}} for his rifle, along with rations for one day, and miscellaneous equipment including a gas mask. The <b>third</b> <b>wave</b> had received the same amount of ammunition, but was also issued entrenching equipment that would be used to construct positions to defend the initial gains against the inevitable Ottoman counterattack. In support, each battalion had four Vickers medium machine-guns, which had been issued with 3,500 rounds, and contributed a platoon whose job would be to throw the 1,200 grenades that the brigade had been allocated for the attack. A small section of engineers was also allocated to undertake demolitions.|$|E
5|$|Having first {{established}} {{themselves in}} the West Coast <b>third</b> <b>wave</b> ska scene, the Daddies ultimately broke into the musical mainstream with their 1997 swing compilation Zoot Suit Riot. Released {{at the onset of}} the late 1990s swing revival, Zoot Suit Riot sold over two million copies in the United States while its eponymous single became a radio hit, launching the Daddies to the forefront of the neo-swing movement. By the end of the decade, however, the Daddies' mainstream popularity declined with that of the swing revival's, and the resulting commercial failure of their ska-flavored follow-up Soul Caddy led to an abrupt hiatus in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In {{the light}} of {{lessons learned from the}} partial Canadian success during Operation Windsor, Charnwood was to be {{launched}} on a broad front to increase the pressure on the German defences and disperse their defensive fire. SHAEF planners had advised, on 10 June, {{that the best way to}} break a stalemate was to use air power to support an attack; this method was to be used for Charnwood as Montgomery enlisted the aid of RAF Bomber Command. Heavy bombers would attack Caen on the night preceding the assault, with 15% of the total bomb load being delayed action bombs set to explode when the ground attack was launched. A second wave of light bombers would follow the heavies and a <b>third</b> <b>wave</b> of American bombers would attack on the morning of the operation.|$|E

40|$|Since March 2013, three {{waves of}} human {{infection}} with avian influenza A(H 7 N 9) virus {{have been detected}} in China. To investigate virus transmission within and across epidemic waves, we used surveillance data and whole-genome analysis of viruses sampled in Guangdong during 2013 - 2015. We observed a geographic shift of human A(H 7 N 9) infections from the second to the <b>third</b> <b>waves.</b> Live poultry market interventions were undertaken in epicenter cities; however, spatial phylogenetic analysis indicated that the third-wave outbreaks in central Guangdong most likely resulted from local virus persistence rather than introduction from elsewhere. Although the number of clinical cases in humans declined by 35 % from the second to the <b>third</b> <b>waves,</b> the genetic diversity of third-wave viruses in Guangdong increased. Our results highlight the epidemic risk to a region reporting comparatively few A(H 7 N 9) cases. Moreover, our results suggest that live-poultry market interventions cannot completely halt A(H 7 N 9) virus persistence and dissemination. 27869613 PMC 518913...|$|R
5|$|The American {{carriers}} {{launched an}} airstrike shortly after dawn; Zuikaku {{was struck by}} three bombs and one torpedo that started fires in both hangars, damaged one propeller shaft, {{and gave her a}} 29.5° list to port. Fifteen minutes later, the fires were extinguished and the list was reduced to 6° by counterflooding. She was mostly ignored by the second wave of attacking aircraft, but was a focus of the <b>third</b> <b>wave</b> that hit her with six more torpedoes and four bombs. The bombs started fires in the hangars, the torpedoes caused major flooding that increased her list, and the order to abandon ship was issued before Zuikaku sank by the stern. Lost with the ship were 49 officers and 794 crewmen, but 47 officers and 815 crewmen were rescued by her escorting destroyers.|$|E
5|$|The second wave, {{scheduled}} for 06:35, consisted of 32 LCVPs carrying four more companies of 8th Infantry, {{as well as}} combat engineers and naval demolition teams that were to clear the beach of obstacles. The <b>third</b> <b>wave,</b> {{scheduled for}} 06:45, consisted of eight LCTs bringing more DD tanks plus armored bulldozers to assist in clearing paths off the beach. It was to be followed at 06:37 by the fourth wave, which had eight Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM) and three LCVPs with detachments of the 237th and 299th Combat Engineer Battalions, assigned to clear the beach between {{the high and low}} water marks.|$|E
5|$|During the {{fighting}} around Broodseinde on 4 October, the 39th formed the <b>third</b> <b>wave</b> of the 10th Brigade's attack, which went in around 6:00am. Following up the 37th and 38th Battalions, they advanced against strongly held pill-boxes towards the Gravenstafel Switch. After digging-in, a party from the 39th joined the 40th Battalion as it launched the final wave in the brigade's attack. As the 40th came up against stiff opposition, more {{men from the}} 39th were pushed forward and the objective was finally secured around 11:00am. After the battle, the 39th remained in the line until 6 October, when it was withdrawn back to Morbecque for reorganisation and rest. A couple of days later, the battalion was recommitted to {{the fighting}} and ordered to advance towards Passchendaele Ridge, attacking {{on the morning of}} 12 October despite heavy rain the previous evening. In the heavy fighting that followed, the battalion managed to secure its first objective, but was forced to withdraw when its flanks became threatened as neighbouring units had been unable to advance with them through the thick mud.|$|E

50|$|Rachel died on April 16, 1931 in Tel Aviv, {{at the age}} of 40. She {{is buried}} in the Kinneret {{cemetery}} in a grave overlooking the Sea of Galilee, following her wishes as expressed in her poem If Fate Decrees. Alongside her are buried many of the socialist ideologues and pioneers of the second and <b>third</b> <b>waves</b> of immigration. Naomi Shemer was buried near Rachel, according to Shemer's wish.|$|R
5|$|With the {{breakthrough}} of <b>third</b> <b>wave</b> ska into the American mainstream by late 1996, the Daddies seemed poised for commercial success, landing {{a spot on}} a well-publicized national tour with popular ska bands Reel Big Fish and Let's Go Bowling. Although the band were mainly playing ska shows at the time, they soon began drawing a sizable following for their swing material when the coincident success of the film Swingers and its featured band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy started drawing public and media attention towards the formerly underground swing revival movement. When fans regularly began approaching the band's merchandise table asking which of their albums contained the most swing, the Daddies realized they lacked an album fully representing their swing side, prompting the band's manager to convince them to compile all of their swing songs onto one CD until {{they could afford to}} make a new album, using their available finances to record several bonus tracks for inclusion. The result, , became an unexpectedly popular item as the band went on tour, reportedly selling as many as 4,000 copies a week through their Northwest distributors.|$|E
5|$|The first Allied {{action of}} D-Day was Operation Deadstick, a glider assault at 00:16 at Pegasus Bridge over the Caen Canal and the bridge (since renamed Horsa Bridge) over the Orne, {{half a mile}} (800 metres) to the east. Both bridges were quickly {{captured}} intact, with light casualties, {{by members of the}} 5th Parachute Brigade and the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion. The five bridges over the Dives were destroyed with minimal difficulty by the 3rd Parachute Brigade. Meanwhile, the pathfinders tasked with setting up radar beacons and lights for further paratroopers (scheduled to begin arriving at 00:50 to clear the landing zone north of Ranville) were blown off course, and had to set up the navigation aids too far east. Many paratroopers, also blown too far east, landed far from their intended drop zones; some took hours or even days to be reunited with their units. Major General Richard Gale arrived in the <b>third</b> <b>wave</b> of gliders at 03:30, along with equipment, such as antitank guns and jeeps, and more troops to help secure the area from counter-attacks, which were initially staged only by troops in the immediate vicinity of the landings. At 02:00, the commander of the German 716th Infantry Division ordered Feuchtinger to move his 21st Panzer Division into position to counter-attack. However, as the division was part of the armoured reserve, Feuchtinger was obliged to seek clearance from OKW before he could commit his formation. Feuchtinger did not receive orders until nearly 09:00, but in the meantime on his own initiative he put together a battle group (including tanks) to fight the British forces east of the Orne.|$|E
25|$|Let's Go Bowling is an American <b>third</b> <b>wave</b> ska band hailing from Fresno, California. Since the band's {{inception}} in 1986, the band's traditional ska style, barbershop harmonies, wisely crafted instrumentals, and its frantic live performances, helped {{set the standard}} for dress and culture for West Coast Ska, which in turn, set the groundwork for the <b>Third</b> <b>Wave</b> Movement in 1995.|$|E
50|$|The repetitious {{nature of}} the {{previous}} evening's strike profiles had allowed North Vietnamese air defense forces to anticipate strike patterns and to salvo 34 missiles into the target area. Four B-52Gs and three B-52Ds {{were lost in the}} first and <b>third</b> <b>waves</b> of the mission. A fourth D model, returning to Thailand, crashed in Laos. Only two of the eight downed crews were recovered by search and rescue aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|Feminist {{scholars}} such as Shira Tarrant {{object to}} the [...] "wave construct" [...] because it ignores important progress between the so-called waves. Furthermore, if feminism is a global movement, she feels {{the fact that the}} [...] "first-, second-, and <b>third</b> <b>waves</b> time periods correspond most closely to American feminist developments" [...] raises serious problems about how feminism fails to recognize the history of political issues around the world.|$|R
5000|$|... {{knowledge}} {{relationships are}} being transformed {{with respect to}} availability. As Toffler states, never before have we been able to instantly access virtually unlimited amounts {{of any kind of}} information for virtually zero cost. Unlike the foundations of past wealth revolutions, the <b>Third</b> <b>Wave's</b> foundation defies traditional economics in that knowledge is not scarce; knowledge is infinite and exponentiates itself. An economy based on knowledge also defies classical economics due to the non-rival property of knowledge.|$|R

25|$|Music historians {{typically}} {{divide the}} history of ska into three periods: the original Jamaican scene of the 1960s (First Wave), the English 2 Tone ska revival of the late 1970s (Second Wave) and the <b>third</b> <b>wave</b> ska movement, which started in the 1980s (<b>Third</b> <b>Wave)</b> and rose to popularity in the US in the 1990s.

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 19 mm. The forewings are dark brown, crossed by three fine waved yellowish-white lines. The third line, outer margin {{and part of}} the inner margin bordered by a metallic steel blue band. The hindwings are crossed by two yellowish-white lines from the costal to the inner margin. There is a <b>third</b> <b>waved</b> line. Both the outer and inner margins are bordered with metallic steel blue. Adults are on wing in July, September and December.|$|R
50|$|Troops, {{along with}} the civilians, used heavy fog to their advantage. The first wave managed to {{surprise}} the waiting Soviet soldiers and artillery; their sheer numbers allowed many to escape. The second and <b>third</b> <b>waves</b> were less fortunate. Soviet artillery and rocket batteries bracketed the escape area, with deadly results that killed thousands. Despite heavy losses, five to ten thousand people managed to reach the wooded hills northwest of Budapest and escape towards Vienna, but only 600-700 German soldiers reached the main German lines from Budapest.|$|R
