50|$|By 2011, {{the site}} was the fourth largest of the sewage {{treatment}} works operated by Thames Water, and served a population equivalent of 885,000. Much of the equipment {{was in need of}} renewal, and levels of suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand and <b>total</b> <b>ammonia</b> allowed in treated effluent were to be lowered from 31 March 2017, {{under the terms of the}} Freshwater Fish Directive and the Water Framework Directive. A major reconstruction project was begun, which involved increasing the capacity of the works to cater for a population equivalent of 941,000 and a peak inlet flow of 497 Megalitres per day (Mld). Because of the constrained nature of the site, consideration was given, during the design phase, to building part of the new works at a separate location. 22 sites within a 2 mi radius of Deephams were initially identified, and these were then reduced to a short-list of five. An assessment of the whole life cost of using a separate site was then undertaken, and concluded that developing the existing site would be the best way forwards. Any solution required that the works could continue to treat 209,000 tonnes of sewage per day to the existing standards while the work was progressing.|$|E

To determine whether changes in potassium concentration would alter ammonia transport in the medullary thick ascending limb (MAL), tubules from rats were perfused in vitro {{and effects of}} changes in K concentration within the physiological range (4 - 24 mM) were evaluated. Increasing K concentration from 4 to 24 mM in perfusate and bath inhibited <b>total</b> <b>ammonia</b> absorption by 50 % and reduced the steady-state transepithelial NH+ 4 concentration gradient. The inhibition of <b>total</b> <b>ammonia</b> absorption was reversible and occurred when K replaced either Na or N-methyl-D-glucamine. Increasing K concentration in the luminal perfusate alone gave similar inhibition of <b>total</b> <b>ammonia</b> absorption. At 1 - 2 nl/min per mm perfusion rate, increasing K concentration in perfusion and bathing solutions had no significant effect on transepithelial voltage. With either 4 or 24 mM K in perfusate and bath, an increase in luminal perfusion rate markedly increased <b>total</b> <b>ammonia</b> absorption. Thus, both potassium concentration and luminal flow rate are important factors capable of regulating <b>total</b> <b>ammonia</b> transport by the MAL.
