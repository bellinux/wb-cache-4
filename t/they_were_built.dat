5|$|The Baths of Zeuxippus {{were popular}} public baths {{in the city}} of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>built</b> between 100 to 200, {{destroyed}} by the Nika revolt of 532 and then rebuilt several years later. They were so called because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>built</b> upon the site where a Temple of Jupiter (Zeus) had formerly existed. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>built</b> around 500 yards south of the much older baths of Achilles of the earlier Greek Acropolis in Byzantion. The baths were famed primarily for the many statues that were built within, and the famous people they each represented. However, they were later used for military purposes, during the seventh century. Excavations of the site and the Baths were made in 1928.|$|E
5|$|Albany has had {{multiple}} buildings dedicated {{to being the}} seat of city government over its history. However, historians disagree on details {{of many of the}} earlier structures, namely, when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>built.</b>|$|E
5|$|Buena Vista {{features}} an early architectural style that {{differs from that}} at Motul de San José, consisting of platforms built from unworked stone, with wide front stairways and probably without superstructures. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>built</b> in the Middle to Late Preclassic periods and then reused in the Late Classic. The differences in style between Buena Vista and Motul probably results from differing epochs of construction.|$|E

One ship was lost after a collision in 1941, but the remaining ships were in service until broken up in the early 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Spain {{commissioned}} three {{ships of}} the , {{with the first}} laid down in 1909. The three ships were the smallest dreadnoughts ever built. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>built</b> in Spain, with assistance; construction on the third ship, , took nine years from its laying down date to completion because of non-delivery of critical material, especially armament, from the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Synagogues {{like the}} First Roumanian-American Congregation, more familiarly {{known as the}} Rumanische shul, were the first spiritual homes for {{successive}} waves of European immigrants. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>built</b> more than 100 years ago, and just like the bridges and tunnels of New York City, they're bound to fail if not attended to.|$|E

5|$|The Menara {{gardens are}} located {{to the west}} of the city, at the gates of the Atlas mountains. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>built</b> around 1130 by the Almohad ruler Abd al-Mu'min. The name menara derives from the {{pavilion}} with its small green pyramid roof (menzeh). The pavilion was built during the 16th century Saadi dynasty and renovated in 1869 by sultan Abderrahmane of Morocco, who used to stay here in summertime.|$|E
5|$|The six Regioni-class cruisersso {{named as}} all vessels save Elba were named for regions of Italywere the first {{protected}} cruisers designed by Italian naval architects. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>built</b> by four different shipyards, and so varied slightly in size, speed, and armament. They {{proved to be}} a disappointment in service, owing to their slow speed and weak armor protection.|$|E
5|$|Estate {{houses in}} Scotland or Scottish country houses, are large houses usually on landed estates in Scotland. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>built</b> from the sixteenth century, after {{defensive}} castles {{began to be}} replaced by more comfortable residences for royalty, nobility and local lairds. The origins of Scottish estate houses are in aristocratic emulation of the extensive building and rebuilding of royal residences, beginning with Linlithgow, under the influence of Renaissance architecture. In the 1560s the unique Scottish style of the Scots baronial emerged, which combined features from medieval castles, tower houses, and peel towers with Renaissance plans, in houses designed primarily for residence rather than defence.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen {{buildings}} {{are open to}} the public as part of the Rancho Camulos Museum, all of which were built before 1930 and are still in their original locations. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>built</b> mostly in Spanish Colonial or Mission Revival styles (the latter is derived from the former). Later buildings were designed in differing architectural styles, more representative of their period of construction. Landscaping features, such as lawns, flower gardens, ornamental trees, and walkways, separate the residential areas from the working portions of the ranch.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{acceptance}} of heliocentrism and equal hours, as well as advances in trigonometry, sundials appeared in their present form during the Renaissance, when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>built</b> in large numbers. In 1524, the French astronomer Oronce Finé constructed an ivory sundial, which still exists; later, in 1570, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Padovani published a treatise including instructions for the manufacture and laying out of mural (vertical) and horizontal sundials. Similarly, Giuseppe Biancani's Constructio instrumenti ad horologia solaria (c.1620) discusses how to construct sundials.|$|E
5|$|From 1911 to 1917, {{money was}} {{collected}} for interior furnishings, which were relatively sparse {{apart from the}} impressive main altar. (These original furnishings remained until the 1930s.) Parts of the draft plan were abandoned: the floor was not constructed from marble as intended, but poured from plain concrete; outside there were no pinnacles on the façade. Writings vary on when the pinnacles were built: some claim <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>built</b> in 1923, but others argue {{that they were not}} completed until the renovation of the cathedral in 1999. Observers that argue for an earlier construction date state that they were damaged during World WarII and left dismantled for some time.|$|E

5|$|German war cemeteries are {{somewhat}} different from French and British ones, being more austere and simple in design. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>built</b> around lawns, without flowers or other decorations, intended to highlight {{acceptance of the}} tragedy and avoid the expensive and pretentious sentimentality that the German VDK felt Allied cemeteries invoked. German war cemeteries also included heldenhaine, heroes' groves populated with oak trees and large boulders, dolmen. Both symbolising nature; this landscaping {{was considered to be}} particularly important for German war cemeteries. The cemeteries used slate grave markers, less individualised than British or French equivalents, and felt to better symbolise the importance German nation as a whole.|$|E
5|$|In 16th century England, Henry VIII began {{building}} Device Forts between 1539 and 1540 as artillery fortresses {{to counter the}} threat of invasion from France and Spain. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>built</b> by the state at strategic points for the first powerful cannon batteries, such as Deal Castle, which was perfectly symmetrical, with a low, circular keep at its centre. Over 200 cannon and gun ports were set within the walls, and the fort was essentially a firing platform, with a shape that allowed many lines of fire; its low curved bastions were designed to deflect cannonballs.|$|E
5|$|Leipzig and Nürnberg {{were the}} {{follow-on}} class {{to the three}} Königsberg-class ships. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>built</b> to a modified design, which included returning the aft turrets to the centerline. Another major change was a new gear system that allowed the diesel and turbine engines to run at the same time, which permitted a lighter propulsion system to reach the same speed of the earlier ships. They were also fitted with bulbous bows to improve their hydrodynamic efficiency. The two cruisers were not identical: Leipzig had a superstructure similar to the Königsbergs, while Nürnberg was built with a much larger structure. Nürnberg was also completed with a much stronger anti-aircraft battery.|$|E
50|$|These routes {{are known}} as corridors. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>built</b> to a higher {{standard}} than US Highways, but less than Interstate standard, although some such as Corridor E <b>were</b> <b>built</b> to <b>be</b> interstates.|$|R

5|$|Line A {{is renowned}} for having kept its {{original}} 1913 rolling stock {{running on the}} line up until 2013, making them the oldest underground carriages in commercial service {{in the world at}} the time. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>built</b> by La Brugeoise, et Nicaise et Delcuve, a Belgian rolling stock manufacturer established in the city of Bruges, between 1913 and 1919. Entirely made of wood, they were originally designed to run as underground as well as tramway cars, but they were adapted in 1927 to their current style for underground service only.|$|E
5|$|On August 29th 2005, flood {{walls and}} levees catastrophically failed {{throughout}} the metro area. Many collapsed well below design thresholds (17th Street and London Canals). Others collapsed {{after a brief}} period of overtopping (Industrial Canal) caused “scouring” or erosion of the earthen levee walls. In eastern New Orleans, levees along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway failed in several places because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>built</b> with sand and erodible materials instead of clay, an obvious construction flaw.|$|E
5|$|The Tudor {{architectural}} period, {{which lasted}} {{from the late}} 15th century into the early 17th century, saw the development of large estates such as Ashton Court. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>built</b> for the local merchants, who gained much of their wealth from the trade passing through Bristol Harbour. Red Lodge was constructed in 1580 for John Yonge as the lodge for a great house that once stood {{on the site of}} the present Colston Hall. In 1615, a number of houses were demolished for the development of the new Fishmarket.|$|E
