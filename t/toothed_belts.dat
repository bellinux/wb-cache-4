50|$|The {{first known}} {{automotive}} application of <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> to drive overhead camshafts was with Devin-Panhard racing specials built by Bill Devin for the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) H-modified racing series. Some of these specials were powered by engines built from the crankcases of Panhard flat-twin engines and the cylinders of Norton motorcycles. The overhead camshafts on the Norton cylinders were driven by <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> from the Gilmer Belt Company {{instead of the}} tower shafts used in the Norton engines. Jimmy Orr won the 1956 SCCA H-modified championship in an overhead camshaft Devin-Panhard.|$|E

50|$|As <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> {{can deliver}} {{more power than}} a friction-drive belt, they are used for {{high-power}} transmissions. These include the primary drive of some motorcycles, notably later Harley-Davidsons; and the supercharger used for dragsters.|$|E
50|$|Aero-engine {{reduction}} gears are typically of the gear type, but smaller two-stroke engines {{such as the}} Rotax 582 use belt drive with <b>toothed</b> <b>belts,</b> which is a cheap and lightweight option with built-in damping of power surges.|$|E

50|$|The first {{production}} automobile {{engine to}} use a <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> to drive an overhead camshaft was made by Hans Glas GmbH for use in their 1004 motor car, introduced in September 1961.|$|R
50|$|The SuperFIRE {{features}} a unique control {{system of the}} engine timing distribution: A <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> drives the camshaft of the exhaust valves, which in turn drives the intake camshaft via a gear.|$|R
50|$|<b>Toothed</b> <b>belts</b> {{have two}} failure modes, one gradual and one catastrophic. There is an {{increased}} risk of either over the lifetime of the belt, so it is common for highly-stressed belts to be given a service lifetime and to be replaced before this failure can occur.|$|E
50|$|A toothed belt; timing belt; cogged belt; cog belt; or {{synchronous}} belt is a flexible belt with teeth moulded onto its inner surface. It {{is designed to}} run over matching toothed pulleys or sprockets. <b>Toothed</b> <b>belts</b> are used in {{a wide array of}} in mechanical devices, where high-power transmission is desired.|$|E
5000|$|The angular-velocity ratio {{may not be}} {{constant}} {{or equal}} to that of the pulley diameters, due to slip and stretch. However, this problem has been largely solved by the use of <b>toothed</b> <b>belts.</b> Working temperatures range from [...] to [...] Adjustment of center distance or addition of an idler pulley is crucial to compensate for wear and stretch.|$|E
50|$|The Endura-DE engine {{features}} a cast iron block and indirect injection style cylinder head, which {{means there is}} a combustion chamber built into the cylinder head. This engine makes use of aluminium for some other components to minimise the weight penalty of the Diesel engine. It has a single overhead camshaft opening eight valves via shim-and-bucket followers. The camshaft is rotated by a <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> driven by a toothed sprocket on the Crankshaft, likewise the fuel injection pump is rotated by a second <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> driven from the crankshaft. The diesel injection pump is a rotary distributor type most typically made by Lucas CAV.|$|R
50|$|Microlight {{aircraft}} {{driven by}} high-speed two-stroke engines {{such as the}} Rotax 532 use <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> reduction drives to allow {{the use of a}} quieter and more efficient slower-speed propeller.

2500|$|... 2,495 cc diesel, {{overhead}} valve, type 12J: Land Rover reworked the old 'two and a quarter' diesel for the 1980s. The {{injection pump}} was driven off a <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> {{at the front}} of the engine (together with the camshaft), a change compared with the older diesels.|$|R
50|$|<b>Toothed</b> <b>belts</b> {{are made}} of a {{flexible}} polymer over a fabric reinforcement. Originally this was rubber over a natural textile, but developments in material science have had a substantial effect in increasing the lifetime of these belts. This included changes from natural to synthetic rubber and polyurethane and also the adoption of nylon, Kevlar, or other aramid fibres and carbon fibres in their reinforcement.|$|E
50|$|With {{help from}} Norton {{motorcycle}} racer Don Evans, Devin adapted the cylinder barrels, cylinder heads and pistons from the Norton Manx motorcycle to the two-cylinder boxer Panhard crankcase, roller-bearing crankshaft assembly and piston rods. He then fabricated a custom manifold that accepted two-barrel side-draft Weber carburetors. All of these alterations {{did not affect}} the displacement of the engine, leaving the 79.5mm bore and 75mm stroke unchanged for a total displacement of 745cc. What made the engine unique was the method Devin used to operate the valves. He abandoned the Panhard's pushrod OHV system and contacted the L. H. Gilmer company about using their <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> to drive the Manx cylinder heads' overhead cams. Development of synchronous toothed-belts was begun by the Gilmer company around 1940. Their primary application had been as a means of transmitting power in textile mills. Devin's use of the technology to drive the valve train in the Devin-Panhard engine was the first time <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> were used in a timing belt application. Devin did not apply for a patent on this innovation.|$|E
50|$|Most {{continuous}} form {{paper is}} punched longitudinally along both edges with regularly spaced engagement holes that engage with sprocket wheels or <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> which move the paper through the printer. It is usually perforated transversely {{with a line}} of closely spaced holes or slits which form a tear edge that allows it to be torn neatly into separate pages after printing; when fed through the printer the paper is simply a continuous sheet.|$|E
50|$|For the B230 engines 1993, piston cooling, oil {{squirting}} jets {{were added}} to help alleviate piston slap problems on the turbo motors. Another modification was to go from a square <b>toothed</b> timing <b>belt</b> set up to a round <b>toothed</b> timing <b>belt</b> setup which made for quieter belt running.|$|R
50|$|The ZeCar is a 5-door {{hatchback}} with a twin AC induction brushless {{and maintenance}} free electric engine, giving the car 140 lb ft of torque. There is a maintenance-free <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> {{drive to the}} rear wheels. Battery charging comprises an on-board automatic charging system, with maintenance-free sealed lead-acid gel batteries.|$|R
50|$|Poppet valves {{are opened}} {{by means of}} a {{camshaft}} which revolves at half the crankshaft speed. This can be either chain, gear or <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> driven from the crankshaft, and can be located in the crankcase (where it may serve one or more banks of cylinders) or in the cylinder head.|$|R
50|$|Timing belts, <b>toothed</b> <b>belts,</b> cogged or cog belts, and {{synchronous}} belts are non-slipping {{mechanical drive}} belts. They are made as flexible belts with teeth moulded onto their inner surface. The belts run over matching toothed pulleys or sprockets. When correctly tensioned, {{these type of}} belts have no slippage, and are often used to transfer motion for indexing or timing purposes (hence their name). They are often used in lieu of chains or gears, so there is less noise and a lubrication bath is not necessary.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{made from}} bolted-together aluminum tubing, with the tailboom built from carbon fibre. Its 6.10 m diameter two-bladed rotor has a chord of 20 cm, with anti-torque handled by a conventional two-bladed tail rotor. The main rotor transmission uses a combination of V-belts and <b>toothed</b> <b>belts.</b> Pitch link controls are mounted inside the hollow rotor mast tube. The aircraft has an empty weight of 193 kg and a gross weight of 386 kg, giving a useful load of 193 kg. With full fuel of 58.8 L the payload is 151 kg.|$|E
5000|$|A gilmer belt was a brand {{or trade}} {{name for a}} {{mechanical}} belt used for transferring power between axles in a machine. The gilmer belt was originally sold by the L. H. Gilmer company after 1949, and {{represents one of the}} earliest toothed belt designs. Gilmer belts use trapezoidal teeth to engage matching grooves on toothed pulleys in order to maintain synchronicity between moving parts. Belts are no longer sold under the Gilmer name, although enthusiasts are still likely to refer to <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> by the gilmer name.|$|E

50|$|The Slant Four {{is a type}} of car engine {{manufactured}} by Vauxhall Motors and, in modified form, by Lotus Cars. Unveiled in 1966, {{it was one of the}} first production overhead camshaft designs to use a rubber <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> to drive the camshaft from the crankshaft a method developed in 1956 by Bill Devin.|$|R
5000|$|Extension and {{retraction}} of {{the outer}} wings was made by a screw jacks and nuts operated by the pilot pumping a handle via two-way free-wheel mechanisms, <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> and torque shafts which pulled or pushed the outer wings over the inner wings as required.

50|$|The {{majority}} of fused filament printers {{follow the same}} basic design. A flat bed is used {{as the starting point}} for the print workpiece. A gantry above this carries the moving print head. The gantry design is optimised for movement mostly in the horizontal X & Y directions, with a slow climb in the Z direction as the piece is printed. Stepper motors drive the movement through either leadscrews or toothed belt drives. It is common, owing to the differences in movement speed, to use <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> for the X,Y drives and a leadscrew for Z. Some machines also have X axis movement on the gantry, but move the bed (and print job) for Y. As, unlike laser cutters, head movement speeds are low, stepper motors are universally used and {{there is no need to}} use servomotors instead.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{physical and}} chemical processes of adhesive bond formation on the interfaces of drive toothed belt components during its manufacturing. Factors affecting bond strength, carrying ability and belt longevity are studied in the paper. The designated principle of materials used for manufacturing drive <b>toothed</b> <b>belts,</b> ensuring high indices of their physical and mechanical properties, is considered in the paper. Compounding of rubber mixes ensuring higher operational resource of the belts is developed. </p...|$|E

Distribution was now by <b>toothed</b> <b>belt.</b> The cylinder is exactly the same, consumption falls slightly. The TU3S motor is a sports motor by design.|$|R
5000|$|A bicycle {{chain is}} a form of roller chain. Bicycle chains may have a master link, or may require a chain tool for removal and installation. A similar but larger and thus {{stronger}} chain is used on most motorcycles although it is sometimes replaced by either a <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> or a shaft drive, which offer lower noise level and fewer maintenance requirements.|$|R
50|$|Idler gears {{can also}} {{transmit}} rotation among distant shafts {{in situations where}} it would be impractical to simply make the distant gears larger to bring them together. Not only do larger gears occupy more space, the mass and rotational inertia (moment of inertia) of a gear is proportional to the square of its radius. Instead of idler gears, a <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> or chain can be used to transmit torque over distance.|$|R
