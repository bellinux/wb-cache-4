5|$|A {{number of}} saints and {{historical}} figures have followed and presented specific approaches to Christian meditation. Both Eastern and Western Christian teachings {{have emphasized the}} use of meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ. The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola use meditative mental imagery, {{with the goal of}} knowing Christ more intimately and loving him more ardently. In The Way of Perfection, St. Theresa of Avila taught her nuns how to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know Christ by using meditation and mental prayer. Hesychastic prayer and meditation continues {{to be used in the}} Eastern Orthodox tradition as a spiritual practice that facilitates the knowing of Christ.|$|E

She attempts to, but suddenly Dylan proposes to Haley (Sarah Hyland) around the campfire one night. This causes Claire (Julie Bowen) to instantly say no for Haley, leading to Dylan running away. The families go off and look for him, during which Haley criticizes Claire for interfering and reveals {{she would not have}} accepted Dylan's proposal. It is also revealed that Dylan gets a job at the ranch and decides to permanently stay in Wyoming, breaking up with Haley.|$|E
5|$|Consisting of Ottoman, Arab and Circassian soldiers, the II Corps {{had three}} options: to {{pass to the}} east of Amman along the Darb el Haj direct to Damascus, {{although}} water would be a problem in that desert region, to attack Chaytor's Force at Amman, or to move westwards, to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the Jordan Valley. Patterson's Column was ordered to entrench Shunet Nimrin, Es Salt and Suweileh in case they moved westwards. On the Royal Fusiliers' right the 2nd Light Horse Brigade closely guarded the country to the south, in particular the Madaba to Naur to Ain Hummar road across the plateau, with a strong detachment occupying Ain es Sir. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade sent a detachment at about midday on 26 September to investigate a report of Ottoman and German soldiers with guns at Er Rumman, but none were found. They subsequently sent a second detachment east of Amman to watch the Darb el Haj. The 20th Indian Brigade of infantry arrived after dark on 26 September to take over garrison duties at Amman.|$|E

25|$|In the Catholic tradition, saints beside Ignatius of Loyola have {{suggested}} prayer and contemplation on scripture as {{a path to}} knowing Christ better. In The Way of Perfection, St. Theresa of Avila taught her nuns how to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know Christ by using mental prayer. While the Catholic Church supports Christian meditation as beneficial in knowing Christ, in the letter Aspects of Christian meditation it specifically warned against using non-Christian (e.g. modified Buddhist) styles of meditations {{as an attempt to}} know Christ.|$|E

[...] Launching at night in heavy swells, Stott had trouble with the motor of his folboat, and he and his companion were forced to use paddles to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> shore. [...] En route, the party was detected by the Japanese and were ordered by Stott to seek an alternative landing site.
