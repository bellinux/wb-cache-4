They are, our {{mortality}} and the facing of imminent death; our groundlessness in that {{we are unable to}} grasp the solution to the enigma of existence, see the beginning or end of time, nor put off the discovery of the meaning of life; our insatiability in <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> want more, and demand the infinite from the finite; and our susceptibility to belittlement which places us in a position to constantly confront petty routine forcing us to die many little deaths.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E

60|$|Now {{here comes}} in the whole {{collapse}} and huge blunder of our age. We have mixed up two different things, two opposite things. Progress should mean <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are <b>always</b> changing the world to suit the vision. Progress does mean (just now) <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are <b>always</b> changing the vision. It should mean <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are slow but sure in bringing justice and mercy among men: it does mean <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are very swift in doubting the desirability of justice and mercy: a wild page from any Prussian sophist makes men doubt it. Progress should mean <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are <b>always</b> walking towards the New Jerusalem. It does mean that the New Jerusalem is always walking away from us. We are not altering the real to suit the ideal. We are altering the ideal: it is easier.|$|R

2500|$|In {{discussing}} his opinion that every mathematical problem {{should have a}} solution, Hilbert allows {{for the possibility that}} the solution could be a proof that the original problem is impossible.

2500|$|In January 2006, Harry Belafonte led a {{delegation}} of activists, including Glover and activist/professor Cornel West, {{in a meeting with}} President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez. [...] In 2006, Glover began working on a film about Toussaint Louverture, who led the 18th century revolt in Haiti. [...] It was reported that Chavez supported the film, [...] "hoping the historical epic will sprinkle Hollywood stardust on his effort to mobilise world public opinion against imperialism and western oppression." [...] In a 2015 interview, Glover said: [...] "The film <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> missed is a movie on the Haitian revolution and Toussaint Louverture...that was the movie that I wanted to do.

2500|$|Nathan Lee of The Village Voice {{said the}} film [...] "works despite feeling both over-familiar and over-ambitious. It crescendos with a {{legitimate}} {{sense of wonder}} (if not profundity) {{thanks in large part}} to the luminous and uncanny score by electro legends Underworld." [...] Writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis viewed director Boyle as a [...] "first-rate, seemingly sweat-free entertainer" [...] who always [...] "sells the goods smoothly, along with the chills, the laughs and, somewhat less often, the tears." [...] She went on to say, [...] "He's wickedly good at making you jump and squirm in your seat, which he does often in [...] "Sunshine," [...] but he tends to avoid tapping into deep wells of emotion." [...] Wesley Morris in The Boston Globe mused that if the film didn't [...] "float your boat as a work of science-fiction, action, philosophy, heliocentrism, or staggering visual spectacle (although, it really should), then it certainly succeeds as a parable for cinematic ambition." [...] He emphatically added, [...] "The surface of this movie is plenty enthralling on its own." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post commented that for the film, [...] "The voyage works, beautifully. While we don't get the ticklish conceit of Scottish profanities in the celestial outer realm, we do get something surprisingly consoling: a deep sense of the humanity <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> carry with us, no matter how far we venture from home." ...|$|E
