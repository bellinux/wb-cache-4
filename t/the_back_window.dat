5|$|That night, Natalie sneaks into Dylan's house. When they kiss, {{something}} apparently cuts her mouth, {{causing her}} to leave in tears. Dare's friends, who believe Dylan is responsible for his death, pull up moments later and abduct him. During the drive, an insect-like protrusion comes out of Dylan's mouth and sprays webbing everywhere, causing the car to flip and crash. Doggett and Reyes arrive at the scene, and are told that Dylan chewed his way out <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>window.</b> Meanwhile, Scully and a bug specialist search Dylan's home. Scully leaves to help Reyes find the teenager while the specialist stays behind; the specialist is subsequently attacked by Dylan's mother.|$|E

Judson's sister-in-law, Trecia Corliss, and her husband George Corliss were {{spending}} the evening with customs-collector Isaac N. Ebey when he was beheaded by a band of Haida Indians. Trecia survived by faking death, and George escaped out <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>window</b> of Ebey's house.|$|E

The SUV exited the freeway onto North Tippecanoe Avenue and briefly stopped at a stoplight, where a pursuing officer observed the perpetrators putting on tactical vests and equipping themselves with rifles. The SUV then continued onward onto East San Bernardino Avenue and entered a suburban area, where the shooter in the backseat, identified as Malik, began firing at police through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>window</b> at 3:08:43p.m.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, AMC {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with the Griffith Company for a convertible body style Eagle, and a prototype version was developed. The cars were marketed during the 1981 and 1982 model years as the Sundancer conversion. The Eagle's monocoque (unibody) body was reinforced and a steel targa roll bar was welded to the door pillars for passenger compartment protection. The front portion of the roof was a removable lightweight fiberglass hatch, while the rear section of polyvinyl material and <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>window</b> folded down and had a boot cover when in the down position.|$|E
25|$|The {{day before}} the 2005 Tour de France, Ullrich was {{training}} when his team car stopped unexpectedly. Ullrich hit <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>window,</b> ending {{up in the back}} seat of the car. Less than 24 hours later Ullrich was passed by Armstrong in the time trial. Ullrich fell again in the mountains, bruising his ribs. He could not keep up with Armstrong or Ivan Basso. Ullrich began focusing on finishing ahead of Michael Rasmussen for a podium position. He rode a good second time trial, beating all but Armstrong. Rasmussen had several crashes and bike changes, which gave Ullrich a podium place in the Tour.|$|E

500|$|When {{choosing}} Michael's {{car for the}} episode, producer Kent Zbornak {{brought in}} pictures of various cars and had the writers choose which one they thought Michael would most likely own. The writers ended up choosing a Chrysler Sebring convertible, because according to B. J. Novak [...] "we figured it's the showiest car that he could afford". While shooting the scene in Michael's car, cameraman Randall Einhorn accidentally broke <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>window,</b> which ended up costing $859 to replace.|$|E
500|$|As Kyle, Stan, Kenny and Cartman {{wait for}} the school bus, Kyle's little brother, Ike, tries to follow Kyle to school. Kyle tells Ike he cannot come to school with him. Cartman tells the boys about a dream he had the {{previous}} night about being abducted by aliens. The others try to convince him the events did happen and that the aliens are called [...] "visitors", but Cartman refuses to believe them. Chef pulls up {{in his car and}} asks if the boys saw the alien spaceship the previous evening, inadvertently confirming Cartman's [...] "dream", and relays stories of alien anal probes (which throughout the episode Cartman denies he experienced). After Chef leaves, the school bus picks up the boys, and (looking out <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>window)</b> they watch in horror as the visitors abduct Ike. Kyle spends the rest of the episode attempting to rescue him.|$|E
500|$|The out {{of control}} RV {{was created by the}} show's special effects coordinator, David Gauthier; an {{auxiliary}} steering wheel was rigged up in the vehicle so that the driver would be able to steer the car from <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>window,</b> out of the camera's sight. Wilson and Renna were fitted with faux vampire teeth – which were sardonically labeled [...] "funny fangs"—courtesy of special effects makeup coordinator Toby Lindala. Wilson later recounted that they fit comfortably in the actor's mouth, musing that [...] "the retainers I had to wear as a kid never fit as well." [...] In order to create the glowing green eyes, fluorescent material was glued to the actors' eyelids. However, because they were unable to see, this gave the vampires a [...] "somewhat vacant" [...] stare. The various corpses with fangs marks were created by makeup artist Laverne Basham. In order to create a suitable model, Gilligan bit {{the back of his hand}} to give Basham something to work with.|$|E

500|$|South Park animators {{created the}} episode using PowerAnimator, the Alias Systems Corporation {{animation}} program most {{commonly known as}} [...] "Alias". Eric Stough, director of animation for the series, said [...] "Mecha-Streisand" [...] was slightly more challenging to animate than other first season episodes due to the laser beam-type effects featured in the final monster fight, which were specifically designed to resemble a low-budget monster movie with poor graphics. The scenes with an instructional guide taking the kids on a fossil hunt were based on real-life arrowhead-digging excursions Parker and Stone went on in Red Rocks Park during their childhood in Colorado. During a scene with Chef and Leonard Maltin driving in a car, actual video footage of Colorado roads is visible through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>window</b> of the car. The footage was shot by a friend of Parker and Stone and used because the animators did not yet know how to create roads in perspective.|$|E
500|$|In {{a parody}} of the Twilight Zone episode [...] "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet", after having a {{nightmare}} {{in which he is}} killed in a bus crash, Bart rides the bus to school one rainy morning. He panics when he sees a gremlin {{on the side of the}} bus loosening the lug nuts on one of the wheels. Bart unsuccessfully tries to convince the other passengers of the danger. In desperation, Bart climbs halfway out the window to scare off the gremlin with an emergency flare. The gremlin catches fire and falls from the bus, but is found by Ned, who decides to adopt the creature. When the bus finally stops, everyone sees the obvious damage, but Bart is still sent away to an insane asylum for the rest of his life for his disruptive behavior. Bart is relieved as he is finally able to rest, but the gremlin appears in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>window</b> of the ambulance, holding Flanders' decapitated (yet still living) head, which makes Bart scream in terror.|$|E
500|$|At 11:30am on 18October1968, {{the flat}} was raided by Sgt. Norman Pilcher, of Scotland Yard's Drugs Squad. In 1974, Lennon remembered that Ono {{answered}} {{the front door}} as a female voice had said (over the intercom), {{that there was a}} message from the Apple office. Ono opened the door and saw the female with five men, who were all dressed in plain-clothes. She panicked and closed the door, thinking they were Beatles' fans. Meanwhile, at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>window,</b> another person was banging on the window and holding up a search warrant for Lennon to read. As Lennon was also panicking—not knowing at that point that they were all police officers—the raid consisted of seven police officers and two police dogs—he played for time and refused to open the window. Because of this, Pilcher later accused Lennon of obstruction of justice, which was a crime. Inside the flat, the police searched every room thoroughly, even though Lennon was supposed to accompany them whilst they did so, according to the law. Pilcher then summoned Lennon and pointed to a binocular case on a mantelpiece, asking him, [...] "Is this yours?" [...] Lennon replied in the affirmative, and was then shown 219grams of hashish, which was in the case.|$|E

2500|$|In early April 2005, Phoenix {{checked into}} rehab {{to be treated}} for alcoholism. On January 26, 2006, while driving down a winding canyon road in Hollywood, Phoenix ran {{off the road and}} rolled his car. The crash was {{reportedly}} caused by brake failure. Shaken and confused, Phoenix heard a tapping on his window and a voice say, [...] "Just relax." [...] Unable to see the man, Phoenix replied, [...] "I'm fine. I am relaxed." [...] The man replied, [...] "No, you're not," [...] and stopped Phoenix from lighting a cigarette while gasoline was leaking into the car cabin. Phoenix then realized that the man was famed German film director Werner Herzog. While Herzog helped Phoenix out of the wreckage by breaking <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>window</b> of the car, bystanders phoned for an ambulance. Phoenix approached Herzog to express gratitude, but Herzog downplayed his heroism and returned to his home nearby.|$|E
2500|$|Cantrell is a {{recovering}} addict and alcoholic {{and has been}} sober since 2003. He was awarded the 2012 Stevie Ray Vaughan Award from MusiCares, for his work helping other addicts with the recovery process. Cantrell said in his acceptance speech, [...] "I crash landed here almost 9 years ago, in Los Angeles. Sean [...] was {{at the door with}} my brother, so my choices were open the door and go to rehab or jump out <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>window</b> down a cliff into some black berry bushes. That’s the choice I took. Luckily they caught me because I couldn’t go anywhere, I was kind of stuck in a bush {{at the bottom of a}} cliff bleeding, and I ended up here. I didn’t intend to get here but I’m very grateful I am here, and it took a lot of people to help me get here. It's been an amazing day. It's overwhelming. I'm as imperfect as they come. I just don't get high today and wake up the next morning and try and do the same thing. A lot of people stand and get the fuck back up after falling. Some people don't get that chance. My band's been a harsh example of that – what happens when you don't deal with it." [...] Cantrell and his Alice in Chains bandmates played a five-song set at the awards event and Cantrell stated, [...] "We really miss Layne [...] and Mike , and we carry them with us in our hearts".|$|E
