5|$|Babangida saw {{even less}} playing {{time after the}} 1999 season, as he made a mere eight {{appearances}} the following year and didn't play a single game {{in the first half}} of the 2000–01 season. In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>offload</b> the player, Ajax came to an agreement with the Turkish Süper Lig side Gençlerbirliği, who signed Babangida on a half-year loan deal until the end of the season.|$|E
5|$|After {{a stop at}} Pearl Harbor for boiler {{repairs and}} <b>to</b> <b>offload</b> her Army passengers, Yancey sailed for Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, {{reaching}} there {{on the last day}} of the year; she was the last ship to transit the Panama Canal in 1945. On 6 January 1946, Yancey cleared Cristobal, Canal Zone, bound for Louisiana. After a brief stop at New Orleans, the attack cargo ship proceeded on, via Jacksonville, Florida, to Norfolk, where she arrived on 29 January. Less than a month later, on 27 February, Yancey sailed farther north and reached the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard the following day.|$|E
5|$|Captain Waggett, the stuffy English {{commander}} of the local Home Guard, orders Odd to guard the cargo, but Macroon casually remarks that, by long-standing custom, a man cannot marry without hosting a party in which whisky must be served. Taking the hint, the sergeant allows himself to be overpowered, and the locals manage <b>to</b> <b>offload</b> {{a large number of}} cases before the ship goes down. Campbell had been sent to his room by his mother for a prior transgression, but is persuaded to leave and assist with the salvage by MacCodrun. This proves fortunate, as Campbell rescues the Biffer when he is trapped in the sinking freighter. The whisky also fortifies the teetotal Campbell's courage enough so he can stand up to his mother regarding Catriona.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} {{different}} offloading scenarios, which help operators controlling the ever increasing of mobile data volumes over the femto and the macro cellular networks. We consider the Selected IP traffic offload (SIPTO) approach in order <b>to</b> selectively <b>offload</b> mobile IP traffic {{in order to}} use servers deployed within the metro network "at/above the RAN". A quantitative study is carried out to estimate the potential gains of bandwidth due <b>to</b> mobile traffic <b>offload,</b> both in the core and the metro networks, depending on the location of the servers accessed thanks <b>to</b> the <b>offloading</b> strategy...|$|R
30|$|When PS-LTE eNBs {{are under}} the {{condition}} of high load, LTE-R coverage can be extended to allow more PS-LTE UEs <b>to</b> be <b>offloaded</b> and then the remaining PS-LTE UEs with better channel quality can be well served by PS-LTE eNBs. In this regard, the offloaded UEs will suffer severe co-channel interference from the PS-LTE eNBs. Thus, ABS/PR-ABS is applied in order to mitigate the interference <b>to</b> the <b>offloaded</b> UEs.|$|R
5|$|In 2014, Boeing {{conceptualized}} an Apache upgrade {{prior to}} the introduction of the U.S. Army's anticipated attack version of the Future Vertical Lift aircraft, forecast to replace the Apache by 2040. The conceptual AH-64F would have greater speed via a new 3,000 shp turboshaft engine from the improved turbine engine program, retractable landing gear, stub wings <b>to</b> <b>offload</b> lift from the main rotor during cruise, and a tail rotor that can articulate 90 degrees to provide forward thrust. In October 2016, the Army revealed they would not pursue another Apache upgrade to focus on funding the FVL; the Army will continue buying the Apache through the 2020s until Boeing's production line ends in 2026, then FVL is slated to come online in 2030.|$|E
5|$|Dickov {{opted to}} build a {{youthful}} side and made controversial decisions {{at the start of}} the season <b>to</b> <b>offload</b> 2009–10 player of the year and club captain Sean Gregan as well as top scorer Paweł Abbott amongst other first team players. The team went into the New Year in ninth position, with games in hand on the teams above them, and being unbeaten at home in the league. Results in the second half of the season were less consistent and the team finished the season in the bottom half of the table. On 6 May 2011 Dickov announced that he would make only his second appearance of the season for the first team in the final match of the season, and would then end his playing career to concentrate on management. He then came on as a 77th-minute substitute the following day against Milton Keynes Dons.|$|E
5|$|The {{costs of}} salvage, clean-up, and {{compensation}} {{are believed to}} have totalled around US$120 million. That included compensation paid by Total to Gulf. Most of the relevant costs were paid by insurance companies and all the various claims and counter-claims were eventually settled out of court. Gulf never reopened the terminal and a feasibility study in 1985 showed that it no longer had any potential use in international oil trade. In 1986, Gulf surrendered its lease on the site to the Irish government. The government used the terminal (after carrying out a limited refurbishment) to hold its strategic oil reserve. Initially, oil movement to and from the terminal was carried out by road. In 1990, {{at the time of the}} first Gulf war, an improvised repair was carried out to the jetty to allow an oil tanker <b>to</b> <b>offload</b> at the terminal on a one-off basis. In 1996, an unloading buoy was installed and this has been used since that time.|$|E
50|$|It came as some {{surprise}} when Beesley {{was sold to}} Leeds United in August 1995 for a £250,000 fee. He was used mainly as a back-up player by manager Howard Wilkinson during his time at Elland Road, starting just 19 top-flight games in close to two seasons at the club. Unable to dislodge either Lucas Radebe or David Wetherall, new boss George Graham looked <b>to</b> <b>offloaded</b> Beesley in 1996-97.|$|R

5|$|The jetty {{facilities}} used two cranes <b>to</b> <b>offload</b> coal, {{with the capacity}} of unloading two ships at one time, {{at a rate of}} 480 tonnes an hour. Coal was also delivered by rail to the east of the station using the Brighton Main Line which passes near the site. Coal was usually delivered to the jetty, rather than by rail. A conveyor belt system was then used to take coal to the coal storage area or directly to the station's boiler rooms. The conveyor belt system consisted of a series of bridges connected by towers. The coal storage area was a large concrete box capable of holding 75,000 tonnes of coal. This had an overhead gantry with a conveyor belt attached to the conveyor belt system, for taking coal from the coal store to the boiler rooms.|$|E
5|$|Although the two clubs {{claimed to}} have sold most of the 42,000 tickets {{allocated}} to them, only about 25,000 fans {{were said to have}} travelled to Moscow from the United Kingdom, with about 110 charter flights arriving ahead of the game. According {{to the head of the}} Russian national tourist office, Mikhail Ignatiev, many fans were put off by the cost of travel and accommodation. Additionally, most of Moscow's hotels were full on the night of the game. As some fans looked <b>to</b> <b>offload</b> tickets to the match, The Moscow Times reported that the black-market price dropped from a high of €2,000 (£1,600) to around €500 (£400), while Russian TV channel Sport-1 was reporting prices as low as £300 for tickets belonging to fans who had failed to make the trip to Moscow. Among the celebrities who did not travel were Chelsea supporter and chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) Sebastian Coe, who had to attend meetings ahead of the 2012 Summer Olympics, and Manchester United fan and Simply Red lead singer Mick Hucknall, who was due to perform at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.|$|E
5|$|Bednar {{joined the}} theatre {{production}} company Live Entertainment Corporation of Canada, Inc. (Livent) in 1989, {{while it was}} still a division of motion picture exhibitor Cineplex Odeon. Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb purchased the division from their employers in December 1989, as Cineplex looked <b>to</b> <b>offload</b> assets. Originally the assistant general manager of The Pantages Theatre, he became its general manager. In 1993, he moved to North York Performing Arts Centre to prepare it for the stage revival of the musical Show Boat. Livent used Toronto as the test site for the original Broadway production of Ragtime; it made it world premiere at North York Centre in 1996, and Bednar was involved in production. As of 1997, Bednar was general manager of The Pantages Theatre. and general manager of theatre for its parent company, Livent. From 1997 to 1998, {{near the end of his}} time with the company, he spent a year in New York City preparing the Ford Center for the Performing Arts for its opening and that of Ragtime; he had worked on the production previously in Toronto. He was scheduled to oversee the remake of Chicago's Oriental Theatre into the Ford Center for the Performing Arts Oriental Theatre.|$|E

40|$|To {{reduce the}} load on {{cellular}} networks, <b>offloading</b> <b>to</b> Wi-Fi {{has long been}} discussed as a technological solution. Despite advances in scheduling algorithms and incentive schemes, most mobile operators do not actively promote Wi-Fi offloading and most Wi-Fi usage is limited to stationary in-home contexts of use. This study assesses the proportion of users on the street that can be <b>offloaded</b> <b>to</b> Wi-Fi access points, taking into account different city topologies, speed of movement and technical characteristics of Wi-Fi access points. We show {{that the proportion of}} users on the street that can be <b>offloaded</b> <b>to</b> Wi-Fi heavily depends on their speed of moving around, the reach of access points and the delay in logging on to access points. However, even when using standard configurations for access points, base stations and smartphones, half the outdoor users can be <b>offloaded</b> <b>to</b> Wi-Fi. These results are consistent for any type of realistic topology of roads in the city. Based on the results, operators are recommended <b>to</b> promote Wi-Fi <b>offloading</b> as it massively reduces the load on cellular networks...|$|R
