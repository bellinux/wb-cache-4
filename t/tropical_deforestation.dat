A national certification scheme (CERFLOR) was recognized in 2002 by the PEFC. Over one million hectares in plantations and natural reserves had been certified by May 2004.

Here we use a recently developed 21 -year (1988 - 2008) record of satellite based vegetation optical depth (VOD, a proxy for vegetation water content and aboveground biomass), to show that nearly all steppe grasslands in Mongolia experienced significant decreases in VOD. Approximately 60 % of the VOD declines can be directly explained by variations in rainfall and surface temperature. After removing these climate induced influences, a significant decreasing trend still persists in the VOD residuals across regions of Mongolia. Correlations in spatial patterns and temporal trends suggest that a marked increase in goat density with associated grazing pressures and wild fires {{are the most likely}} non-climatic factors behind grassland degradation. © 2013 Liu et al...|$|R
