[...] Markus Schomer, chief global economist at PineBridge Investments, suggested that the uncertainty both in and outside of Spain has made it hard to price the scenarios into final markets so far.

6000|$|... 10.45. - And I did. I {{want to say}} {{something}} more to you about the three women. I wonder so much why they should have been WOMEN, and halt between two opinions in the matter. Sometimes I think it is because they were made by a man for men; sometimes, again, I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> abstract reason for it, and there is something more substantive about a woman than ever there can be about a man. I can conceive a great mythical woman, living alone among inaccessible mountain-tops or in some lost island in the pagan seas, and ask no more. Whereas if I hear of a Hercules, I ask after Iole or Dejanira. I cannot think him a man without women. [...] But I can think of these three deep-breasted women, living out all their days on remote hilltops, seeing the white dawn and the purple even, and the world outspread before them for ever, and no more to them for ever than a sight of the eyes, a hearing of the ears, a far-away interest of the inflexible heart, not pausing, not pitying, but austere with a holy austerity, rigid with a calm and passionless rigidity; and I find them none the less women to the end.|$|E
6000|$|It is also {{provided}} that the slaves of persons convicted under these sections shall be free. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> unfortunate form of expression rather than a substantial objection in this. It is startling to say that Congress can free a slave within a State, and yet if it were said the ownership of the slave had first been transferred to the nation and that Congress had then liberated him the difficulty would at once vanish. And {{this is the real}} case. The traitor against the General Government forfeits his slave at least as justly as he does any other property, and he forfeits both to the government against which be offends. The government, so far as there can be ownership, thus owns the forfeited slaves, and the question for Congress in regard to them is, [...] "Shall they be made free or be sold to new masters?" [...] I perceive no objection to Congress deciding in advance that they shall be free. To the high honor of Kentucky, as I am informed, she is the owner of some slaves by escheat, and has sold none, but liberated all. I hope {{the same is true of}} some other States. Indeed, I do not believe it will be physically possible for the General Government to return persons so circumstanced to actual slavery. I believe there would be physical resistance to it which could neither be turned aside by argument nor driven away by force. In this view I have no objection to this feature of the bill. Another matter involved in these two sections, and running through other parts of the act, will be noticed hereafter.|$|E
6000|$|But in France the {{question}} of whether Zola shall go to the Panthéon when he is dead is quite as practicable as {{the question}} whether he should go to prison when he was alive. It is the problem of whether the nation shall take one turn of thought or another. In raising a monument to Zola they do not raise merely a trophy, but a finger-post. The question is one which will have to be settled in most European countries; but like all such questions, it has come first to a head in France; because France is the battlefield of Christendom. That question is, of course, roughly this: whether in that ill-defined area of verbal licence on certain dangerous topics it is an extenuation of indelicacy or an aggravation of it that the indelicacy was deliberate and solemn. Is indecency more indecent if it is grave, or more indecent if it is gay? For my part, I belong to an old school in this matter. When a book or a play strikes me as a crime, I am not disarmed by being told that it is a serious crime. If a man has written something vile, I am not comforted by the explanation that he quite meant to do it. I know all the evils of flippancy; I do not like the man who laughs at the sight of virtue. But I prefer him to the man who weeps at the sight of virtue and complains bitterly of there being any such thing. I am not reassured, when ethics are as wild as cannibalism, {{by the fact that they}} are also as grave and sincere as suicide. And I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> obvious fallacy in the bitter contrasts drawn by some moderns between the aversion to Ibsen's [...] "Ghosts" [...] and the popularity of some such joke as [...] "Dear Old Charlie." [...] Surely there is nothing mysterious or unphilosophic in the popular preference. The joke of [...] "Dear Old Charlie" [...] is passed--because it is a joke. [...] "Ghosts" [...] are exorcised--because they are ghosts.|$|E

6000|$|SCENE II.--A Garden behind LOVELESS'S Lodgings. Enter LOVELESS and SERVANT. Love. Is my wife within? Ser. No, sir, she {{has gone}} out this half-hour. Love. Well, leave me.--[Exit SERVANT.] How strangely does my mind run on this widow!--Never was my heart so {{suddenly}} seized on before. That my wife should pick out her, of all womankind, to be her playfellow! But what fate does, let fate answer for: I sought it not. So! by Heavens! here she comes. Enter BERINTHIA. Ber. What makes you look so thoughtful, sir? I hope you are not ill. Love. I was debating, madam, whether I was so or not, {{and that was it}} which made me look so thoughtful. Ber. Is it then so hard a matter to decide? I thought all people were acquainted with their own bodies, though few people know their own minds. Love. What if the distemper I suspect be in the mind? Ber. Why then I'll undertake to prescribe you a cure. Love. Alas! you undertake you know not what. Ber. So far at least, then, you allow me to be a physician. Love. Nay, I'll allow you to be so yet further: for I have reason to believe, should I put myself into your hands, you would increase my distemper. Ber. How? Love. Oh, you might betray me to my wife. Ber. And so lose all my practice. Love. Will you then keep my secret? Ber. I will. Love. Well--but swear it. Ber. I swear by woman. Love. Nay, that's swearing by my deity; swear by your own, and I shall believe you. Ber. Well then, I swear by man! Love. I'm satisfied. Now hear my symptoms, and give me your advice. The first were these; when I saw you at the play, a random glance you threw at first alarmed me. I could not turn my eyes from whence the danger came--I gazed upon you till my heart began to pant--nay, even now, on your approaching me, my illness is so increased that if you do not help me I shall, whilst you look on, consume to ashes. [Takes her hand.] Ber. O Lord, let me go! 'tis the plague, and we shall be infected. [Breaking from him.] Love. Then we'll die together, my charming angel. Ber. O Gad! the devil's in you! Lord, let me go!--here's somebody coming. Re-enter SERVANT. Ser. Sir, my lady's come home, and desires to speak with you. Love. Tell her I'm coming.--[Exit SERVANT.] But before I go, one glass of nectar to drink her health. [To BERINTHIA.] Ber. Stand off, or I shall hate you, by Heavens! Love. [Kissing her.] In matters of love, a woman's oath is no more to be minded than a man's. [Exit.] Ber. Um! Enter COLONEL TOWNLY. Col. Town. [Aside.] So? what's here--Berinthia and Loveless--and in such close conversation!--I cannot now wonder at her indifference in excusing herself to me!--O rare woman!--Well then, let Loveless look to his wife, 'twill be but the retort courteous on both sides.--[Aloud.] Your servant, madam; I need not ask you how you do, you have got so good a colour. Ber. No better than I used to have, I suppose. Col. Town. A little more blood in your cheeks. Ber. I have been walking! Col. Town. Is that all? Pray was it Mr. Loveless went from here just now? Ber. O yes--he has been walking with me. Col. Town. He has! Ber. Upon my word I think he is a very agreeable man; and there is certainly something particularly insinuating in his address. Col. Town. [Aside.] So, so! she hasn't even the modesty to dissemble! [Aloud.] Pray, madam, may I, without impertinence, trouble you with a few serious questions? Ber. As many as you please; but pray let them be as little serious as possible. Col. Town. Is it not near two years since I have presumed to address you? Ber. I don't know exactly--but it has been a tedious long time. Col. Town. Have I not, during that period, had {{every reason to believe that}} my assiduities were far from being unacceptable? Ber. Why, to do you justice, you have been extremely troublesome--and I confess I have been more civil to you than you deserved. Col. Town. Did I not come to this place at your express desire, and for no purpose but the honour of meeting you?--and after waiting a month in disappointment, have you condescended to explain, or in the slightest way apologise for, your conduct? Ber. O heavens! apologise for my conduct!--apologise to you! O you barbarian! But pray now, my good serious colonel, have you anything more to add? Col. Town. Nothing, madam, but that after such behaviour I am less surprised at what I saw just now; it is not very wonderful that the woman who can trifle with the delicate addresses of an honourable lover should be found coquetting with the husband of her friend. Ber. Very true: no more wonderful than it was for this honourable lover to divert himself in the absence of this coquette, with endeavouring to seduce his friend's wife! O colonel, colonel, don't talk of honour or your friend, for Heaven's sake! Col. Town. [Aside.] 'Sdeath! how came she to suspect this!--[Aloud.] Really, madam, I don't understand you. Ber. Nay, nay, you saw I did not pretend to misunderstand you.--But here comes the lady; perhaps you would be glad to be left with her for an explanation. Col. Town. O madam, this recrimination is a poor resource; and to convince you how much you are mistaken, I beg leave to decline the happiness you propose me.--Madam, your servant. Enter AMANDA. COLONEL TOWNLY whispers AMANDA, and exit. Ber. [Aside.] He carries it off well, however; upon my word, very well! How tenderly they part!--[Aloud] So, cousin; I hope you have not been chiding your admirer for being with me? I assure you we have been talking of you. Aman. Fy, Berinthia!--my admirer! will you never learn to talk in earnest of anything? Ber. Why this shall be in earnest, if you please; for my part, I only tell you matter of fact. Aman. I'm sure there's so much jest and earnest in what you say to me on this subject, I scarce know how to take it. I have just parted with Mr. Loveless; perhaps it is fancy, but I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> alteration in his manner which alarms me. Ber. And so you are jealous; is that all? Aman. That all! is jealousy, then, nothing? Ber. It should be nothing, if I were in your case. Aman. Why, what would you do? Ber. I'd cure myself. Aman. How? Ber. Care as little for my husband as he did for me. Look you, Amanda, you may build castles in the air, and fume, and fret, and grow thin, and lean, and pale, and ugly, if you please; but I tell you, no man worth having is true to his wife, or ever was, or ever will be so. Aman. Do you then really think he's false to me? for I did not suspect him. Ber. Think so? I am sure of it. Aman. You are sure on't? Ber. Positively--he fell in love at the play. Aman. Right--the very same. But who could have told you this? Ber. Um!--Oh, Townly! I suppose your husband has made him his confidant. Aman. O base Loveless! And what did Townly say on't? Ber. [Aside.] So, so! why should she ask that?-- [Aloud.] Say! why he abused Loveless extremely, and said all the tender things of you in the world. Aman. Did he?--Oh! my heart!--I'm very ill--dear Berinthia, don't leave me a moment. [Exeunt.] ...|$|E
