Yichang was particularly adamant {{on the need to}} learn about Confucianism after losing a lawsuit over a parcel of land; he believed that his opponent had been victorious in the dispute {{as a result of their}} ability <b>to</b> <b>quote</b> the sayings of ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius throughout their argument.|$|E
