Small cables may exit the tray through the ventilation openings, which may be either slots or holes punched in the bottom.

5000|$|Generally speaking, Australian {{models are}} {{modified}} {{from the original}} models, {{in the case of}} the M113A1 series this included the AN/VIC-1 communications harness, large dust filters for the passenger compartment ventilation blower, heavy steel track manufactured by ADI, provision for 600 kg of belly armor, the Cadillac-Gage T-50 turret mounting twin [...]30 Brownings (early service) or a [...]30/.50 Brownings machine guns for APC/LRV versions, a <b>traverse</b> <b>bar</b> to prevent the crew commander traversing the turret to the rear over the troop compartment roof hatch with the guns depressed low. For some reason, besides the M577A1 command vehicle, all of versions of the M113A1 had the passenger compartment heaters removed. In the late 1980s, the fleet was issued with German BM8005 image intensifying night vision driving periscopes, which, with the aid of an adaptor, could be fitted to replace the driver's central periscope for night driving. In the early 90s, the fleet was issued with VINSON family cipher equipment, typically a single KY-57 per vehicle. This allowed the command net to be enciphered, but the admin net would normally work en clair.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, the M192 {{features}} an integrated traversing and elevation (T&E) mechanism. Instead of the M122's ratcheting screw {{method of operation}} and locking <b>traversing</b> <b>bar,</b> the M192 uses a pair of levers, which unlock the gun's position. The levers are designed to allow the gunner to make [...] "bold adjustments" [...] or [...] "minor adjustments", {{depending on how much}} pressure the gunner uses.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{tangential}} drive (Tdrive) polysilicon, {{linear actuator}} is presented which produces large magnitude tangential motion by flexing a microstructure in an essentially straight line with moderate input voltage. These devices have been designed, fabricated, and successfully tested to have substantial displacements even for static positioning. The working {{principle of the}} T-drive is that the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between a fixed bar and a free bar are converted to large amplitude tangential motion by the parallelogram flexural suspension of the free bar. Operating devices are capable of tangential displacements as great as 32 pm. This displacement is stable and easily varied, since the tangential displacement can be controlled by adjusting the potential between the fixed electrode and the <b>traversing</b> <b>bar.</b> Static displacements are detectable for voltages as low as 15 VDC. Typical T-drives have free bars 200 m long, 12 pn wide, with flexural suspensions 450 pn long and 2 pm wide. All component thicknesses are 2 pn. Theoretical models for both the flexural suspension and electrostatic forces have been derived and they predict the relation between tangential displacement and excitation voltage...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStimulus {{attributes}} that influence a recently reported illusion called “illusory rebound motion” (IRM; [Hsieh, P. -J., Caplovitz, G. P., & Tse, P. U. (2005). Illusory rebound motion and the motion continuity heuristic. Vision Research, 45, 2972 – 2985. ]) are described. When a bar alternates between two different colors, IRM {{can be observed}} to <b>traverse</b> the <b>bar</b> as if the color were shooting {{back and forth like}} the opening and closing of a zipper, even though each color appears in fact all at once. Here, we tested IRM over dynamic squares or disks defined by random dot or checkerboard textures to show that (1) IRM can be perceived in the absence of first-order motion-energy (or when the direction of net first-order motion-energy is ambiguous); (2) the direction of IRM is multistable and can change spontaneously or be changed volitionally; and (3) the perceived frequency of IRM is affected by several factors such as the contours of the stimulus, stimulus texture, and motion-energy...|$|R
5000|$|The popular {{obstacle}} course {{was the final}} event of the original Superstars to determine the overall winner. The Superteams version featured the {{obstacle course}} as an earlier event. The original course had the contestants climb a 12' rope wall, run through a tubular tunnel, push a blocking sled (or <b>traverse</b> across monkey <b>bars</b> in the Women's and Superteams versions), cleanly step through a dozen tires (2 rows of 6), jump over a water hazard (rectangular pool of water), clear a 4'6" [...] high bar, jump two sets of hurdles and cross the FINISH line. Penalty seconds were added for missing tires, stepping in the water hazard and knocking down the high bar and/or hurdles. Some athletes have shown super skills on this course by climbing the wall without using the rope and clearing the high bar like a hurdle.|$|R
40|$|We {{calculate}} the radiation spectrum off a q (q) over bar pair of a fixed opening angle theta(q (q) over <b>bar)</b> <b>traversing</b> a medium of length L. Multiple {{interactions with the}} medium are handled in the harmonic oscillator approximation, valid for soft gluon emissions. We discuss the time-scales relevant to the decoherence of correlated partons traversing the medium and demonstrate how this relates to the hard scale that govern medium-induced radiation. For large angle radiation, the hard scale is given by Q(hard) = max(r(perpendicular to) (- 1), Q(s)), where r(perpendicular to) = theta L-qq is the probed transverse size and Q(s) is the maximal transverse momentum accumulated by the emitted gluon in the medium. These situations define in turn two distinct regimes, which we call "dipole" and "decoherence" regimes, respectively, which are discussed in detail. A feature common to both cases is that coherence of the radiation is restored at large transverse momenta, k(perpendicular to) > Q(hard) ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{spirit of}} turning the Court into a {{political}} debating arena extended to all present. In spite of the vast efforts made by them all, {{only one of the}} barristers employed has added much to his legal reputation by the occasion. Imputations were made, such as I presume were never before uttered by one lawyer against another in a court of law. An Attorney-General sent a challenge from his very seat of office; and though that challenge was read in Court, it was passed over by four judges with hardly a reprimand. If any seditious speech was ever made by O'Connell, that which he made in his defence was especially so, and he was, without check, allowed to use his position as a <b>traverser</b> at the <b>bar,</b> as a rostrum from which to fulminate more thoroughly and publicly than ever, those doctrines for uttering which he was then being tried; and, to crown it all, even the silent dignity of the bench was forgotten, and the lawyers pleading against the Crown were unhappily alluded to by the Chief Justice as the [...] "gentlemen on the other side." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{footsteps}} illusion (FI) {{demonstrates that}} an object’s background {{can have a}} profound effect on the object’s perceived speed. This illusion consists of a yellow bar and a blue bar that move over a black-and-white, striped background. Although the bars move at a constant rate, they appear to repeatedly accelerate and decelerate in antiphase with each other. Previously, this illusion has been explained in terms of the variations in contrast at the leading and trailing edges of the bars that occur as the <b>bars</b> <b>traverse</b> the striped background. Here, we show that this explanation is inadequate and instead propose that for each bar, the bar’s leading edge, trailing edge, lateral edges, and the surrounding background edges all contribute to the bar’s perceived speed and that the degree to which each edge contributes to the motion percept is determined by that edge’s contrast. We show that this theory can explain all the data on the FI as well as the belly dancer and Wenceslas illusions. We conclude by presenting a new illusion, the kickback illusion, which, although geometrically similar to the FI, is mediated by a different mechanism, namely, reverse phi motion...|$|R
40|$|Mitosis {{in growing}} hyphae of haploid and diploid Aspergillus nidulans {{has been studied}} with the light {{microscope}} in Helly-fixed preparations. At {{the periphery of the}} nucleus a sharply defined granule is invariably found which has strong affinity for acid fuchsin. Mitosis begins with the duplication of this granule and the development inside the nucleus of a gradually lengthening fibre between the daughter granules. This fibre is also visible in dividing nuclei of living hyphae examined by phase-contrast microscopy, when it appears as a grey <b>bar</b> <b>traversing</b> the non-nucleolar region. Division of the chromatin has been studied in preparations stained with aceto orcein, directly or after hydrolysis. It proceeds through four phases, beginning with the condensation of distinct chromosomes from the chromatin network of the resting nuclei. Later the chromosomes become arranged in two parallel rows of chromatinic masses in which individual chromosomes can no longer be distinguished. Division is completed by migration of the chromatin to the ends of each row, giving the appearance of a transverse break in the double bar. The chromatin accumulating at the ends of the double bar condenses to form the two daughter nuclei. The number of chromatinic elements appears to be the same in both haploid and diploid nuclei, although the individual elements are larger in the latter...|$|R
40|$|The PANDA {{experiment}} at {{the facility}} for anti-proton and ion research (FAIR) will study the strong interaction by precision spectroscopy. A detector system with excellent particle identification (PID) is therefore required. Charged hadron identification in the barrel region will be performed by a compact ring imaging Cherenkov detector based on the DIRC (Detection of Internally Reflected Cherenkov light) principle. Figure 1 : Display of a simulated event with three tracks in the barrel DIRC detector. The bar boxes are shown in cyan, the locations of Cherenkov photons on the detector plane are shown in yellow. The design of the PANDA barrel DIRC [1], shown in Fig. 1, {{is based on the}} BABAR DIRC [2] with several important improvements, such as focusing optics and fast photon timing. The radiators are long, rectangular bars made from synthetic fused silica, each bar is 2500 mm long with a cross-section of 17 mm × 33 mm. Six bars comprise one bar box and 16 bar boxes surround the beam line at a radial distance of 50 cm. Cherenkov photons, emitted by a particle <b>traversing</b> the radiator <b>bar,</b> propagate along the length of a bar. A mirror, attached to the forward end of the bar, reflects them back to the readout end where they are focused via a doublet lens and an expansion volume on a flat detector plane. An array of multi-anode MCP-PMTs is used to detect the photons and measure the arrival time with a precision of approximately 100 ps. Several key design elements still need to be optimized...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. We are {{developing}} a method for retinotopic mapping of the visual cortex in people with central field loss. Retinotopic mapping based on polar coordinates uses rotating wedges and expanding rings, which assume stable foveal fixation. However, people with central field loss usually adopt a non-foveal retinal location for fixation and that location is typically unknown. Therefore, instead of using the polar-coordinate based mapping method, which requires a known origin, we developed a set of phase-coded mapping stimuli in Cartesian coordinates that will also allow us to estimate the fixation locations relative to the unknown fovea location. The current study aims to validate this new mapping procedure in observers with normal vision. Method. High-resolution structural and functional MR images were acquired on a Siemens 3 T system. Two mapping stimuli were used. Both were 2 deg wide checkered bars, which extended across the full-display. One was a vertical bar moving across the screen from left to right. The other was a horizontal bar that moved from top to bottom. In both cases, the <b>bar</b> <b>traversed</b> the display 4 times, each pass taking 72 s. Since the subjects fixated on a dot {{at the center of the}} display, the bars should cross the fixation at the mid-point of the 72 -second period. This time point was compared with the time point when the bars cross the fovea, which was estimated by deriving the switch of V 1 activation from one hemisphere to the other hemisphere produced by the vertical bar, and from the lower bank to the upper bank of the calcarine sulcus produced by the horizontal bar. Results. With this new method, the estimated fovea locations were within 2 deg from the actual locations. Conclusions. Our new stimuli allow us to estimate the fixation location with acceptable precision. This new procedure may be useful for retinotopic mapping on people with central field loss. 1 page(s...|$|R
