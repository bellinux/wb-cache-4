40|$|The Kanunnik Petrus Jozef <b>Triest</b> <b>Square</b> {{is an open}} {{structure}} {{in the heart of}} the Caritas Psychiatric Centre in Melle (near Ghent). It is an unexpected outcome in the margin of the development of a vision for a spatial masterplan for the psychiatric centre. Inspired by Doina Petrescu’s ideas on the user-architect, all the users were brought together at the drawing board. Workgroups of doctors, managers, staff and patients examined the question of how the psychiatric centre in the future should look like. In this paper I open the files of the practice-based research conducted at the Caritas Psychiatric Centre. The newly opened Kanunnik Petrus Jozef <b>Triest</b> <b>Square</b> is the starting point to reflect on 1) the possibilities to common the (psychiatric) clinic, 2) the construction of design intelligence, 3) postmodernism as a critique of healing environment, 4) the expanded idea of architecture, and 5) the future of relational architecture. status: accepte...|$|R
5000|$|A {{traditional}} <b>try</b> <b>square</b> has a broad blade made {{of steel}} that is riveted to a wooden handle or [...] "stock". The inside of the wooden stock usually has a brass strip fixed to it to reduce wear. Some blades also have graduations for measurement. Modern try squares may be all-metal, with stocks that are either die-cast or extruded.|$|E
50|$|A {{machinist}} square or engineer's square is the metalworkers' {{equivalent of}} a <b>try</b> <b>square.</b> It consists of a steel blade inserted and either welded or pinned into a heavier body at an angle of 90°. Usually a small notch is present at the inside corner of the square. This prevents small particles from accumulating at the juncture and affecting the square's reading.|$|E
50|$|A Speed Square (rafter square, rafter angle square, {{triangle}} square) is a triangular-shaped, carpenters' {{marking out}} tool manufactured and sold by Swanson Tool Co., Inc. The Speed Square combines {{some of the}} most common functions of the combination square, <b>try</b> <b>square,</b> and framing square into one. It is used to make basic measurements and mark lines on dimensional lumber, and may be used as a saw guide for making short 45 and 90 degree cuts.|$|E

50|$|A <b>try</b> <b>square</b> is a {{woodworking}} or a metalworking tool {{used for}} marking and measuring {{a piece of}} wood. The square refers to the tool's primary use of measuring the accuracy of a right angle (90 degrees); to try a surface is to check its straightness or correspondence to an adjoining surface. A piece of wood that is rectangular, flat, and has all edges (faces, sides, and ends) 90 degrees is called four square. A board is often milled four square in preparation for using it in building furniture.|$|E
50|$|The {{ultimate}} {{method of}} mechanically calibrating a <b>try</b> <b>square</b> or similar {{is with a}} cylindrical master square sitting on a granite or cast iron surface plate that is flat. By nature of their construction a cylindrical master square cannot help but sit at a perfect 90 degree angle to the flat surface. A square to be tested can {{be presented to the}} master and feeler gauges used with a source of light behind the gap to get a reading of deviation. If done cleanly, correctly and accurately this method can find errors down to 10 µm, which is the limit of practical accuracy since thermal expansion from contact with the fingers will distort the blade by approximately that much.|$|E

40|$|The study {{identified}} {{practical skills}} possessed by woodwork graduates of Niger state technical colleges in using woodworking machines, hand tools and consumables. Three research questions were answered and two hypotheses tested at 0. 05 level of significance. A survey research design was adopted for the study. A structured questionnaire {{was used to}} gather data from one hundred and two respondents. Simple random sampling was applied to identify the study sample. Mean rating was used to answer research questions, t- test statistics {{was used to test}} the hypotheses. Cronbach Alpa Formula was used to determine reliability coefficient of the instrument. The reliability coefficient of the instrument was found to 0. 81. The findings of the study showed that Woodwork graduates of technical colleges in Niger State used all the woodworking machines listed except band saw machine, tenoning machine, mortiser and thicknesser. They used all the hand tools such as hammer, screw driver, hand plane, electric jig saw, scraper, pincer, plier, <b>try</b> <b>square</b> and spanner. It was recommended that State Government should provide modern machines for improving practical skills of woodwork students and Woodwork teachers should teach students how to apply formica on wood surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Your {{challenge}} is to design a robotic arm that will lift a ping pong ball from a storage area to a basket located 12 ” off the ground. You will {{only be able to}} use the materials provided and you will have a limited time frame to complete the task. Each member of your group needs to participate in each step of the process. Points will be awarded each time a team correctly completes a stage in the process. If a team fails to correctly complete a step, they must redo that step. 1. The robotic arm can stand no taller than 24 ” before it is in its extended position 2. No more than 8 syringes may be used in the construction of the robotic arm 3. Your robotic arm must be able to rotate at least 90 ° from its original position 4. The size of the base of the robotic arm must not be altered in any way (supplied by teacher) 5. The syringe control panel must not be altered in any way (supplied by teacher) 6. Each group must submit a completed design packet before they can participate in the final competition When you meet as a team you should: •Review the problem. •Review the specifications. •Each team member should draw at least two thumbnail sketches of possible robot arm designs. •Meet as a group and review all of the thumbnail drawings from each of your team members • Select one final design and each team member needs to draw that design on the final design sheet. (The final design may be a combination of many designs) •HINT: Keep the design simple! Sometimes the best solution is the simplest one.
