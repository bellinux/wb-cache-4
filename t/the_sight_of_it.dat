5|$|In Brooklyn {{during the}} 1980s, a heavyset, middle-aged woman walks alone meets a mysterious man who greets her and shows her {{the remains of}} a black leather jacket. The woman sobs at <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and the man begins to tell a story.|$|E
5|$|A third subplot centres on the {{relationship}} between Fenwick, Mr. Puddleham, the village's Methodist minister, and the Marquis of Trowbridge, Bullhampton's principal landowner. The marquis believes that Sam Brattle is guilty of the murder, and is angered by Fenwick's support for him. He spreads rumours about Fenwick's relations with Carry Brattle, and grants Puddleham permission to build a chapel on a piece of land neighbouring Fenwick's residence, where he hopes that <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and the sound of its bell will annoy the vicar. Fenwick tries to reconcile himself to the existence of the chapel, but it subsequently comes to light that the land does not belong to the marquis, and is instead part of the parish's glebe. The embarrassed marquis pays to move the chapel to a new location, and through the intervention of his son, a suave Member of Parliament, he and Fenwick are reconciled.|$|E
25|$|Richie Benaud {{decides to}} retire. Channel 9 Commentary Team Selection Committee has {{to choose a}} new Commentary Team Captain for when Richie Benaud retires to his {{vineyard}} estate, 'Chateau Verdaflore', in the South of France. In the running for the Captain are all the current commentary team of Bill Lawry, Tony Greig, Mark 'Tubby' Taylor, Ian Healy and Ian Chappell. Richie gives them advice on how they can improve their chances of being picked as commentary team captain. He advises Tony to get a hairpiece (Tony takes Greg Matthews' advice on the matter and buys a wig from Advanced Hair Hats with a ponytail), Bill to get several centimetres of his nose cut off (Bill's nose job results in Richie vomiting at <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it)</b> and Ian to take some speaking lessons (Ian shows Richie what he has learnt from the class during a match, which pleases Richie).|$|E
60|$|It was Steve. A subdued and furtive Steve. Kirk's heart leaped at <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> him. <b>It</b> {{was as if}} he {{had found}} {{something}} solid to cling to in a shifting world.|$|R
60|$|The {{precious}} relic, {{with all}} its shattered hopes, came {{at the right moment}} to soften his hard-worn heart. <b>The</b> <b>sight,</b> <b>the</b> touch <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> shot like an electric spark through the black stifling thunder-cloud of his soul, and dissolved it in refreshing showers of tears.|$|R
60|$|That evening I had the {{certificate}} framed and {{hung over the}} dining-room fireplace, trusting that <b>the</b> continual <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> would forever put at rest at once the dreams and stratagems of my household.|$|R
500|$|Five {{hundred years}} earlier Vasari had said [...] "The whole world came running when the vault was revealed, and <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> {{was enough to}} reduce them to stunned silence." ...|$|E
500|$|Watts's {{supporters}} {{claimed that}} the image of Hope had near-miraculous redemptive powers. In his 1908 work Sermons in Art by the Great Masters, Stoke Newington Presbyterian minister James Burns wrote of a woman who had been walking to the Thames with the intention of suicide, but had passed the image of Hope in a shop window and been so inspired by <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> that rather than attempting suicide she instead emigrated to Australia. In 1918 Watts's biographer Henry William Shrewsbury wrote of [...] "a poor girl, character-broken and heart-broken, wandering about the streets of London with a growing feeling that nothing remained but to destroy herself" [...] seeing a photograph of Hope, using the last of her money to buy the photograph, until [...] "looking at it every day, the message sank into her soul, and she fought her way back to a life of purity and honour". When music hall star Marie Lloyd died in 1922 after a life beset with alcohol, illness and depression, it was noted that among her possessions was a print of Hope; one reporter observed that among her other possessions, it looked [...] "like a good deed in a naughty world".|$|E
2500|$|In 1942 {{he headed}} to the United States in search of work. On the way, he had to sell his shoes in order to eat, {{crossing}} the border barefoot. He then stowed away on a train to head to Washington [...] In the United States he worked in Maryland, New York, Philadelphia and Washington on rail lines, taking pictures as a hobby. [...] One of his coworkers was {{run over by a}} train, and Garcia took pictures of the body, attracted to <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> on the snow. However, the pictures did not come out and because of this disappointment, he decided to study photography seriously. He remained in the United States until he was deported in 1945.|$|E
60|$|The boys also {{constructed}} a beautiful little ship from a {{print of the}} Alcestis, so successfully, that the doctor promised to buy it; and Ethel grudged <b>the</b> very <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> to <b>the</b> bazaar.|$|R
60|$|It {{was about}} this time that a lassie {{came out of the}} house {{carrying}} a pack or bundle; and it has often made me smile to think how Alan's instinct awoke at <b>the</b> mere <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|March 14th. I {{locked up}} {{the end of}} the cravat in my writing-desk. No change in the dreadful suspicions that <b>the</b> bare <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> rouses in me. I tremble if I so much as touch it.|$|R
2500|$|In scene two, Annabel, {{has decided}} that {{they can afford to}} give Alice £5,000 and no more, {{seemingly}} indifferent to the alternative that the Police will exhume the body, find the traces of medicine and send Miriam to jail. Miriam, however, insists on trying to sweeten Alice up by offering her some wine in a summer house built over an old well. Annabel has a seizure at <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> – after her marriage to her violent husband collapsed, and her business with it, she drank herself to a heart attack. As they wait, they remember their times in the garden: Annabel in the tennis court, pelted with balls by her father, and Miriam's brief relationship with a man called [...] "Lewis", ended by her disapproving father.|$|E
2500|$|Stephen King {{liked the}} film, stating: [...] "Of Fox's two summer creepshows , give the edge to The Happening, partly because M. Night Shyamalan really understands fear, partly because this time he's {{completely}} let himself go (hence the R rating), {{and partly because}} after Lady in the Water {{he had something to}} prove". Critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, awarding the movie three stars, found it [...] "oddly touching": [...] "It is no doubt too thoughtful for the summer action season, but I appreciate the quietly realistic way Shyamalan finds to tell a story about the possible death of man". William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called it [...] "something different—and a pleasant surprise" [...] among that summer's major Hollywood releases, and approved of its taking [...] "the less-is-best approach." [...] The New York Times’ Manohla Dargis praised Wahlberg's lead performance, adding that the film [...] "turns out to be a divertingly goofy thriller with an animistic bent, moments of shivery and twitchy suspense". Philipa Hawker of The Age gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting on [...] "the mood of the film: a tantalizing, sometimes frustrating parable about the menaces that human beings might face from unexpected quarters," [...] drawing special attention to [...] "the sound of the breeze and <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> ruffling the trees or blowing across the grass— an image of tension that calls to mind Antonioni's Blowup". Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times said, [...] "It almost dares you to roll your eyes or laugh at certain scenes that are supposed to be deadly serious. But, you know what, I appreciated this creatively offbeat, daring sci-fi mind-trip". Reviewer Rumsey Taylor said that the film moves forward with [...] "jack-in-the-box suspense, traipsing from one garish death to another in a parade of cartoonish terror," [...] and noted how the film seemed like [...] "Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds, only without the birds." ...|$|E

50|$|Prior to dawn on {{the final}} day of the tsechu a huge tapestry, or thongdrel, is unfurled in the {{courtyard}} of the dzong for several hours. <b>The</b> mere <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is believed to bring spiritual liberation.

60|$|He stopped abruptly--a little {{confused}} {{in spite of}} himself.

It was now too late to unsay the words, but {{not too late to}} mislead his hearers.|$|R
60|$|All cast work in metal, {{unfinished}} by hand, is inadmissible in {{any school}} of living art, since it cannot possess {{the perfection of}} form due to a permanent substance; and <b>the</b> continual <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is destructive <b>of</b> the faculty of taste: but metal stamped with precision, as in coins, is to sculpture what engraving is to painting.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> made me sad. We {{had been}} walking hard {{for three hours}} and a half, and had accomplished, apparently, about four miles. But Harris was delighted.|$|E

25|$|I do {{not believe}} that the present sombre {{prospect}} in Turkey will be long permitted to offend <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Christendom. <b>It</b> so mars the humane and enlightened civilization that belongs to the close of the 19th century that it seems hardly possible that the earnest demand of good peoples throughout the Christian world for its corrective treatment will remain unanswered.|$|R
60|$|It was unfortunate {{perhaps that}} she should have been {{standing}} there unveiled upon the poop within the range of Asad's glance; for <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> her <b>it</b> may have been that overcame his momentary hesitation and stifled the caution which prompted him to accede. He considered her a moment, and a faint colour kindled in his cheeks which anger had made livid.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Promoting perspiration, indeed,’ growled John Evenson, {{stopping}} {{short in}} his {{walk across the}} large squares {{in the pattern of}} the carpet—‘I was ass enough to be persuaded some time ago to have one in my bedroom. ‘Gad, I was in it once, and it effectually cured me, for <b>the</b> mere <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> threw me into a profuse perspiration for six months afterwards.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|Presently, quite mechanically, he stooped {{down and}} lifted the flowery china cover. [...] "Ter dash 'er Buttud Toce!" [...] he shouted at <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and clapped the cover down again hard....|$|E

50|$|Many calamities {{have fallen}} upon {{the people of}} Athens lately, and they have blamed Gismonda.

60|$|If {{there are}} degrees in speechlessness, Kirk's aphasia became doubled and trebled at <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> her. <b>It</b> {{seemed to him}} that he went all to pieces, as if he had {{received}} a violent blow.
