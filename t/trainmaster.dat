50|$|Its {{development}} was backed financially by rock and roller Neil Young {{as part of}} a partnership between Young and one-time Lionel owner Richard Kughn known as Liontech. Liontech, roughly headquartered on Young's northern California ranch, consisted of a loose confederation of technology developers whom Young had assembled to help develop individual components of the <b>TrainMaster</b> Command system.|$|E
50|$|Also debuting in 1994 was {{the brainchild}} of Neil Young, Lionel's <b>Trainmaster</b> Command Control, a {{technology}} similar to Digital Command Control which permits, among other things, the operation of Lionel trains by remote control.

Once the runaway had slowed to 11 miles per hour, CSX <b>trainmaster</b> Jon Hosfeld ran alongside the train, climbed aboard, and shut down the engine. The train was stopped just southeast of Kenton, Ohio, before reaching the GP38. All the brake blocks on #8888 had been destroyed by the heat from being applied throughout the runaway trip.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{most other}} O scale manufacturers, Williams never added {{electronics}} such as <b>Trainmaster</b> Command Control or Digital Command System to its locomotives. This decision gained Williams {{a small but}} devoted following among those hobbyists who want a more [...] "traditional" [...] train layout reminiscent of the 1950s but who want to buy modern equipment. However, this decision has also allowed companies such as MTH and K-Line to eclipse it in size in spite of being an older company.|$|E
5000|$|Yellek is a {{community}} in the Canadian province of Ontario, located just west of North Bay {{on the north shore}} of Lake Nipissing in the unincorporated township of Commanda. Now accessed only from Highway 17, the community was first established in 1915 by the Canadian Northern Railway as a rail siding. Being about midway from North Bay to Field, Yellek was the first passing track west of North Bay and was named for <b>trainmaster</b> R. J. Kelley ("Yellek" [...] is Kelley spelled backwards).|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} proliferate <b>Trainmaster</b> Command Control as a standard, Lionel {{licensed}} it {{to several of}} its competitors, including K-Line. Lionel, LLC continued to manufacture and market trains and accessories in O scale under the Lionel brand and S gauge under the American Flyer brand. While most of the American Flyer products are re-issues using old Gilbert tooling from the 1950s, the O scale equipment {{is a combination of}} new designs and reissues. Lionel also ventured into HO scale at times during its history, with limited success.|$|E
50|$|He {{advanced}} to become supervisor of freight exchanged {{at the lake}} terminus of the railway at Monroe, Michigan. He was transferred to Toledo, Ohio where he stayed until August 1858. He served as <b>trainmaster</b> there and {{was in charge of}} all employees at the Toldeo terminus. Talmadgewas a passenger train conductor in St. Louis, Missouri for the Terre Haute and Alton Railroad during the next portion of his career. In April 1864, he was appointed assistant superintendent of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad prior to resigning to take a position on military roads.|$|E
50|$|Legacy Control System (Legacy) is Lionel's current {{electronic}} control system. It was introduced {{as a successor}} to Lionel's <b>Trainmaster</b> Command Control (TMCC) in December, 2007. Legacy is backward compatible with all TMCC decoder equipped engines. Models with Legacy sound decoders and/or Odyssey II speed control can be operated with earlier TMCC control systems but also have addition features only accessible with Legacy. The command codes for these additional features differ from the DCC command codes. Lionel has not published or licensed access to the Legacy specific command codes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trainmaster</b> Command Control (TMCC) is Lionel's {{original}} {{command control}} system. It was introduced exclusively in Lionel trains in 1995. Beginning in 2000, Lionel offered licenses to other manufacturers. Licensees that formerly or currently install TMCC decoders in their models include Atlas O, K-Line, Weaver, and Sunset Models 3rd Rail Division. Licensees that formerly or currently offer separate sale decoders include Train America Studios, Digital Dynamics, and Electric RR Co. TMCC decoders have mostly been installed in 3-rail O gauge models, {{but it has}} also been offered in 2-rail O scale and S scale.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, TMCC (<b>TrainMaster</b> Command Control) was introduced. This {{allowed the}} {{collectors}} {{to walk around}} the layout without staying at the control panel. It allowed new features like whistle, bell, chugging, diesel roar, electro-couplers, ability to turn RailSounds on or off, and many more. In 1996, Lionel introduced the Century Club line, which featured Postwar items such as the 736 Berkshire and GG1 with TMCC Command Equipped RailSounds. In 1998, Lionel introduced the Postwar Celebration Series. This featured trains, coaches, freight cars, accessories, and transformers from the Postwar era. The Postwar Celebration Series lasted from 1998 to 2009.|$|E
50|$|MTH and Lionel {{developed}} a rivalry {{similar to that}} between Lionel and Ives in the 1930s and Lionel and American Flyer in the 1940s and 1950s. Although their train cars are {{the same size and}} can operate as part of the same train, the two companies' locomotives use their own proprietary electronic control systems. MTH uses a system called Digital Command System (DCS), which is capable of operating MTH engines as well as engines using Lionel's <b>Trainmaster</b> Command Control (TMCC), used by many other O gauge manufacturers, and Digital Command Control (DCC), which is an open industry standard used by most two-rail scales.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, Lionel LLC {{made the}} switch from the MPC Sound of Steam to the new and {{improved}} Railsounds 1.0 in their analog stages. Some of the engines to get this new sound system were the A6 switcher, Reading T1, and the New York Central Mohawk. In 1995, Lionel introduced the <b>Trainmaster</b> Command Control TMCC system along with the fully digital Railsounds 2.5. Engines that got this control and sound system were mostly Hudsons, like the 1995 Lionel #490 C&O Hudson, the 1995 Boston and Albany 618 Hudson, and the 1996 Lionel Commodore Vanderbilt. Others soon followed like the articulated engines in 1999 and 2000.|$|E
50|$|In 1971, Batory {{took his}} first job as a {{traveling}} auditor in freight car accounting for the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad (DT&I). Batory rose through the ranks at DT&I, working as a traveling auditor, administrative assistant {{to the vice president}} of operations, assistant engineer of the Flat Rock, Michigan track system, industrial engineer manager, and director of material procurement and planning. When Grand Trunk Western Railroad bought DT&I, Batory became a transportation supervisor in Pontiac, Michigan, <b>trainmaster</b> in Toledo, Ohio, terminal manager and district operations manager in Chicago, and director of transportation planning in Detroit. In 1987, he became general manager of Chicago, Missouri and Western Railway.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{included}} in the <b>TrainMaster</b> Command system is RailSounds, which provides digital sound effects to complement the digital control features of the system. RailSounds was developed by a separate team of technologists in the Bay Area. An early, distinguishing feature of RailSounds {{was the fact that}} each individual locomotive system (e.g. a [...] "Hudson" [...] 4-6-4 steam locomotive) was based on a real-life counterpart, not a generic [...] "steam" [...] sound. The Lionel RailSounds Hudson sound system was captured by the Liontech team on location in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, using the former Canadian Pacific [...] "Royal Hudson" [...] as the sound model.|$|E
5000|$|A {{control cable}} to the trailroad {{switches}} had been incorrectly reconnected after being dug up accidentally. When traffic was finally allowed {{to pass the}} station, the Gothenburg bound train was switched over to the opposite track where an outbound train was arriving.An off-duty <b>trainmaster,</b> reading the paper {{in one of the}} locomotives, heard the train driver say [...] "Helvete nu smäller det" [...] (roughly translated: [...] "Hell, now that's a crash"). He managed to open the side door and leap out, the trains collided when he was still in the air and despite doing this at 100 km/h he survived with just a broken foot.|$|E
50|$|When he was seventeen, Hughitt {{moved to}} Chicago, Illinois. He {{had heard that}} the Illinois & Mississippi Telegraph Company was seeking telegraphers, and in 1854 he was hired. He rose {{through the ranks of}} the company and was made {{superintendent}} of the office under former Supreme Court of Illinois justice John D. Caton. Representatives of the St. Louis, Alton and Chicago Railroad, one of the early railways in Chicago, took notice and offered Hughitt a position as superintendent of telegraph. When the company reorganized in 1861 to become the Chicago & Alton Railroad, Hughitt left the company to take a position as <b>trainmaster</b> for the southern division for the Illinois Central Railroad in Centralia, Illinois.|$|E
50|$|After {{growing up}} in Booneville, Arkansas, Starling {{began his career as}} a railroader in 1967 on the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot two blocks from his house. After {{attending}} college, he went to work in 1971 for the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway as a clerk telegrapher. He entered dispatcher training in 1973 in the consolidated training office in Springfield, Missouri, later taking management training and becoming an assistant <b>trainmaster</b> in Memphis, Tennessee, where he worked for Hunter Harrison. When the Burlington Northern Railroad purchased the railroad in 1980, he became Director of Trains and Terminals for his region; as part of his work, he first met Mike Haverty, who he would later succeed as President and CEO of Kansas City Southern.|$|E
