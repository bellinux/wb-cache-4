5000|$|Although metachromasia was {{observed}} and described since 1875, by Cornil, Ranvier and others, {{it was the}} German scientist Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915) who gave its name and studied it more extensively. The modern understanding of metachromasia was advanced by Belgian histologist Lucien Lison, who studied it between 1933 and 1936 and ascertained its value in the quantitative determination of sulfate esters of high molecular weight. He also studied the metachromasia of nucleic acids. More recently, Karlheinz Toepfer published in 1970 spectral shifts with increasing concentration of the <b>thiazine</b> <b>dyes</b> that matched the spectra of dye:heparin mixtures, showing clearly that metachromasia, corresponding to the colour of stained cartilage, could be reproduced by high concentration of the dye alone in solution. Hence, proximity of the dye molecules was the key parameter in defining metachromasia. Another example of metachromatic dye (fluorochrome) is acridine orange.

By studying the interaction of the dye and gold nanoparticles under conditions of different ionic strength and by using a zetasizer and TEM to measure the gold nanoparticle size it was demonstrated that the cause of enhancement was not due to nanoparticle aggregation.

40|$|<b>Thiazine</b> <b>dyes</b> such as thionin, {{methylene}} blue and methylene green have been cation exchanged within monovalent cation exchanged Y zeolites. Depending {{on the water}} content, the dye molecules exist as either monomers ('dry') or dimers ('wet'). The monomeric dye, upon excitation with visible light, generates singlet oxygen, which has been utilized to oxidize alkenes to hydroperoxides. In the case of trisubstituted alkenes, hydroperoxidation within zeolites occurs {{with a certain amount}} of regioselectivity. The oxidation within zeolites is accompanied by photodecomposition of the dye and the product hydroperoxides and acid catalyzed rearrangement of the alkenes. In order to understand the observed selectivity, ab initio and DFT calculations on model systems have been performed. The calculations confirm fairly strong cation-alkene binding as well as additional geometric and orbital distortions. Computed activation energies for hydrogen abstraction suggest a significant rare retardation due to metal coordination. At both the MP 2 and B 3 LYP levels, formation of the tertiary hydroperoxide by hydrogen abstraction from the methyl group (4 -position) of 2 -methyl 2 -butene is calculated to be favored by a small margin. Between the gem-dimethyl units, abstraction from the syn methyl group is favored slightly compared to the anti counterpart. These predictions are not compatible with the observed regioselectivities.

40|$|A {{series of}} titania films of {{different}} thicknesses (60 - 420 nm), and therefore activities, are produced using a sol-gel method and assessed for photocatalytic activity using three test methods. The first two involve the photo-oxidative bleaching of common dyes, namely methylene blue (MB), a cationic <b>thiazine</b> <b>dye,</b> and Acid Orange 7 (AO 7), an anionic, azo dye, in aerated aqueous solution. The third test uses an ink comprising, amongst other things, a redox dye, Resazurin (Rz), and an easily oxidized species, glycerol.

The initial rates of destruction of MB and AO 7 and the initial rate of reduction of Rz depend directly upon {{the thickness of the}} titania films, indicating a strong correlation between the different tests. The significance of these results is discussed in the context that the MB test is currently being considered by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as a standard method for assessing the photocatalytic activities of the surfaces.

Using 1 micron araldite sections stained with Toluidine Blue for light microscopy, with further electron microscopic study where required, we have described mast cells in the epithelium of bronchioles, terminal bronchioles, and respiratory bronchioles. Examination of these cells at both microscopic levels demonstrates many of the typical features of mast cells [...] namely, metachromatic granules on staining with toluidine blue at light microscopic level, surface microvillous processes, and numerous dense intracytoplasmic granules with a whorled substructure at electron microscopy. Furthermore, we have identified cells devoid of granular material which may be recognised as mast cells by virtue of their nuclear and cell surface characteristics [...] the occurrence of a spectrum of change between those cells devoid of granular material and those with full granule content; and a few cells in which we found both typical dense, whorled granules and large lucent vacuoles devoid of such material. Quantitation of all respiratory epithelial cells by light microscopy shows that mast cells comprise 0 - 2 % of the total population.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} <b>thiazine</b> <b>dyes</b> is methylene blue (MB), which is extensively used in the dyeing industry. It also facilitates a number of biological applications. Methylene blue dye is not significantly hazardous, but it can lead to various harmful effects. Among the physicochemical processes developed to remove this dye from wastewater textile and dyestuff manufacturing industries, the oxidative decolorizeation method alone seems to ensure the advantage of a low cost, simple, and efficient process. So we investigated a detailed oxidative decolorization kinetic study of MB by sodium-N-chloro-p- toluenesulfonamide (chloramine-T or CAT) in alkaline medium catalyzed by Os(VIII) spectrophotometrically at 664 nm (Î»max of the dye). The reaction rate showed a first-order dependence each on CATo and MBo, a fractional-order dependence on Os(VIII), and an inverse-fractional-order dependence on NaOH. A decrease of the dielectric constant of the medium by the addition of methanol decreased the rate. The solvent isotope effect kâ�² (H 2 O) /kâ�² (D 2 O) was equal to 1. 37. Activation parameters were computed. The kinetics of oxidation of MB by CAT was also studied with other platinum metal ions. The relative reactivity of these catalysts are in the order Os(VIII) > Ru(III) > Ir(III) g Rh(III) g Pt(IV) > Pd(II). This trend may be attributed to the different d-electronic configurations of the metal ions. It was found that the catalyzed reactions are about 3 -fold to 10 -fold faster than the uncatalyzed reactions. The mechanism proposed and the derived rate law are consistent with the observed kinetics. This simple and economic redox system can also be adopted for removing the MB dye present in industrial wastewater. Â© 2010 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|The {{photo-oxidation}} of amines sensitised by benzophenone {{and other}} ketones, fluorescein and <b>thiazine</b> <b>dyes,</b> and aromatic hydrocarbons has been examined. The major products {{obtained from the}} sensitised photo-oxidation of aliphatic secondary and tertiary amines were aldehydes and imines. Only aldehydes were obtained from aliphatic primary amines. The benzophenone sensitised photo-oxidation of N-alkylated anilines gave de-alkylated amines, amides and aldehydes. It is proposed that the primary process in all these reactions is {{the interaction of the}} amine with excited sensitiser, and that the products are formed by subsequent radical reactions. The reactions are not initiated by attack of singlet oxygen o the amine. The most important evidence presented in favour of a radical mechanism is as follows. 1. The types of products formed are compatible with a radical mechanism. The same types of products are obtained with all the sensitisers used, which implies that the sensitisers act by a common mechanism. 2. Only those compounds which are photoreduced by amines in deoxygenated solution act as sensitisers for the photo-oxidation of these amines. This implies that the primary process in photo-oxidation is the same as in photoreduction, namely the interaction of amine with excited sensitiser. 3. Plash photolysis of aerobic solutions of dyes or aromatic hydrocarbons with amines produced transient species which could only have "been formed "by the interaction of amine with the excited sensitiser. 4. Amines such as triethylamine and ethyldi-isopropylamine, which are efficient physical quenchers of singlet oxygen, are photo-oxidised efficiently with all the sensitisers used. This is evidence that singlet oxygen is not the active species in these photo-oxidations. Evidence from flash photolysis studies is also presented, which implies that the primary process with all the sensitisers involves electron transfer or exciplex formation. The fact that amines can compete effectively with oxygen for the excited sensitiser is due to the rapidity of such electron transfer processes...|$|R
30|$|Dyes, pigments, {{and their}} causative {{compounds}} are difficult for industrialization {{since they are}} highly carcinogenic and undesirable in water as reported. Consequently, {{it is necessary to}} remove them from wastewater before discharge. Methylene blue (MB) is a water-soluble <b>thiazine</b> <b>dye,</b> commonly used for dyeing of silk, leather, plastics, and paper. On inhalation, MB can give rise to short periods of rapid or difficult breathing while ingestion through the mouth may cause hypertension and discomfort. To prevent harmful impacts of MB on receiving waters, the degradation of MB is of great importance in water treatment [1, 2]. In recent years, catalysts have attracted much attention of scientists to removal of dyes [3, 4]. Among the various catalysts, MnO 2 is considered {{as one of the most}} outstanding metal oxides on new catalytic oxidation systems, due to its relative low price, chemical stability, and non-toxic property. By now, many efforts have been made on the application of MnO 2 in battery materials, supercapacitor, and catalysts [5 - 10]. However, few studies have attention on the conductive polymers/MnO 2 composites in water treatment. Among the conducting polymers, poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) has become commercially available conducting polymer because of its high conductivity, effective thermal stability, fast charge/discharge ability, low-oxidation potential, and high cycling stability [11 - 13]. In addition, delocalized conjugated structures of conductive polymers have been proven to arouse a rapid photoinduced charge separation and decrease the charge recombination rate in electron-transfer processes [14, 11]. Until now, many chemical methods have been reported for the formation of conducting polymer/MnO 2 composites. Commonly, monomers are always oxidized to obtain the conducting polymer, and KMnO 4 is reduced to give MnO 2. Despite the obvious advantages of simplicity and reproducibility in this synthetic method, the morphology of such composites and the size of MnO 2 particles are normally hard to control. More interestingly, it has been recently revealed that conducting polymers themselves show redox activity toward KMnO 4, where KMnO 4 is always reduced to MnO 2 [15]. As the redox reactions occur on the surfaces of conducting polymers, MnO 2 will prefer to adsorb on the surfaces of the conducting polymer. Recently, graphene oxide (GO) has received intensive attention owing to the fascinating mechanical, electrical, thermal, and optical properties. In comparison with other carbon materials, GO has the perfect sp 2 hybrid carbon nanostructure and various oxygen groups including epoxide, hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl groups. In addition, the conjugation of GO with semiconductor solid particles results in catalysts with improved charge separation, reduced recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, increased specific surface area, and an adequate quantity of adsorption sites, which could lead to the enhancement of degradation efficiency of wastewater [16 - 19]. On account of the abovementioned advantages, the reasonable combination of PEDOT, GO, and MnO 2 would produce some novel composites with excellent catalytic performance.|$|E

While the conventional UVC sensors employing WBS convert the generated EHPs into an electrical signal via a solid-state junction device (SSD), our newly proposed UVC sensory system works by converting EHPs into an electrochemical reaction. The electrochemical reaction causes the degradation of a cationic <b>thiazine</b> redox <b>dye,</b> methylene blue (MB) and thereby spontaneously changes its color. As more rGO was hybridized with the gallium oxide, MB degradation was effectively expedited. Thus, the level of MB degradation under UVC can be evaluated as a UVC indicator.

Although MB is not hazardous compared to other commercial dyes, acute exposure to MB can cause increased heart rate, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea and shock (Nasuha et al. 2010; ALzaydien 2009). It can cause eye burns which may lead to permanent injury to the eyes of human and animals (Rafatullah et al. 2010). On inhalation, it can give rise to short periods of rapid or difficult breathing (dyspnea), while ingestion through mouth produces a burning sensation (Rafatullah et al. 2010; Tan et al. 2008). Potential exposure to MB can also cause hypertension, pre-cordial pain, dizziness, headache, fever, fecal discoloration, profuse sweating, mental confusion, methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia (Saha 2009; Saha and Datta 2009; Ghosh and Bhattacharyya 2002;). Hence, there is a necessity for the treatment of effluents containing such dye due to its harmful impacts on receiving waters.|$|R

The contribution of these dyes as light harvesting species is seen from the photocurrent action spectrum of the cell. Here, we report the sensitization activity of these dyes in terms of current-potential curve, open-circuit potential, fill factor, IPCE, and overall solar energy conversion efficiency which have been evaluated under 100 [*]mW/cm 2 light intensity. The results suggest that dyes based on fluorone and azo groups are promising candidates for high performance, dye-sensitized solar cells because of better anchoring groups (–COOH, –OH, and –SO 3 -) present in these dyes. Better anchorage of dyes to the surface of TiO 2 semiconductor helps in charge transfer phenomenon...|$|R

Over 10, 000 of different commercial dyes and pigments exist currently and more than 7  ×  105 tonnes are produced annually worldwide [1, 2, 3]. Discharge of dye-bearing wastewaters into the natural environment from textile, paper and leather industries causes a serious threat for the aquatic life [4]. On the other hand, limited aquatic resources and increasing demand for safe water require efficient water treatment methods [5]. Synthetic dyes are generally resistant to biodegradation and physicochemical techniques for their removal [6, 7], such as adsorption, chemical oxidation, electrocoagulation and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been extensively used to comply {{with more and more}} stringent legislation regarding the maximum allowable dye concentration in wastewaters [7, 8, 9, 10]. Methylene blue (MB) is a <b>thiazine</b> cationic <b>dye</b> with widespread applications, including coloring paper, dyeing cottons, wools and coating for paper stock. It is also used in microbiology, surgery and diagnostics and as a sensitizer in photo-oxidation of organic pollutants. Although it has low toxicity, it can cause some specific harmful effects for the human health such as heartbeat increase, vomiting, shocks, cyanosis, jaundice and tissue necrosis [11, 12]. Hence, its removal from wastewaters is an important issue for the environmental protection [13]. The conventional methods have been extensively used for treating waters contaminated with heavy metal and dyes [14, 15, 16]. However, these methods present some disadvantages such as high cost, low removal efficiency and production of excessive toxic sludge [17]. Recently, inexpensive, ecofriendly and not pathogenic organisms have been used for the dye removal [18]. In this respect, the biosorption process has attracted a great interest in this context, and seems a good alternative for the removal of dyes and other pollutants from wastewaters [19, 20], as a replacement for costly commercially biosorbents [21]. It can be defined as sequestering of organic or inorganic compounds by alive or dead biomasses or their derivatives; the biomass can consist of bacteria [22], fungal [19], yeasts [22], algae [23], seaweeds and even industrial or agricultural wastes [24, 25]. Different vegetal biomasses have been used such as Opuntia ficus indica [26], Sugar beet pulp [21], Stoechospermum marginatum [24], Scolymus hispanicus L. [27], Palm kernel [28], Pinus brutia Ten. [29], Waste orange peel [30], Posidonia oceanica L. [31], Cyperus rotundus [32], Date stones and Palm-trees waste [33].|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{an account of}} studies made on the {{distribution}} and nature of acid mucopolysaccharides in the mammalian renal papilla. The papilla {{was found to be}} the only region of the kidney which has an appreciable extracellular space with acid mucopolysaccharide enmeshed in connective tissue fibres. Animals are unable to secrete urine which is either more concentrated or more dilute than plasma unless the tonicity of this region is greater than that of plasma. In {{the first part of this}} work (Chapter 2) the extent of extracellular acid mucopolysaccharide was correlated with the ability of the species to conserve water. It was found that the papilla could be sharply delineated by staining the acid mucopolysaccharide within it. This had the advantage over the less distinct cut surface appearances in that it was possible accurately to measure the length of the papilla in relation to that of the cortex and medulla in stained sections. An empirical relationship between the development of the papilla and the ability to secrete hypertonic urine was obtained for a number of species: U max = 1. 74 (Mandprime;/Candprime;) + 0. 6, where U max is the maximum concentration in Osmols/litre that can be achieved in the urine; Mandprime; is the length of the papilla, measured as the distance of the region containing extracellular acid mucopolysaccharide from the papillary tip towards the renal cortex; and Candprime; is the continuation of this line through the medulla and cortex. The correlation coefficient for the six species for which figures for maximum urinary concentration were known was 0. 9. The significance of this expression is discussed in Chapter 2 in relation to a similar equation put forward by Black in 1965. The morphology of the connective tissue in the papilla of the guinea pig was examined by light and electron microscopy (Chapter 3) and by histochemistry (Chapter 4). The histological results were correlated with the electrophoretic and staining characteristics of acid mucopolysaccharides extracted from this region. There was very little collagen of the adult type to be found in the papilla. The main fibrillar component was reticulin which was well demonstrated by silver impregnation and the periodic acid - Schiff technique. Within the reticulin mesh another class of PAS positive fibril was found which, in addition, stained positively for anionic groups. These fibrils could not be impregnated with silver. In the electron microscope the second class of fibril was seen not to be banded and to be smaller than the reticulin fibrils. The histochemical results (Chapter 4) showed that the largest part of the amorphous extracellular acid mucopolysaccharide in the papilla was hyaluronic acid. In addition, two quantitatively small fractions were observed in the biochemical extracts which were associated with the extracellular acid mucopolysaccharide. Both these fractions stained metachromatically with <b>thiazine</b> <b>dyes</b> and were shown to incorporate radioactive sulphate. In sections metachromatic extracellular material was confined to the tip of the papilla: In this region of high in vivo osmotic pressures the interstitial cells also contained monochromatic granules. The exact nature of these two fractions was not elucidated, nor was an attempt made to identify the intracellular granules with its synthesis or destruction. The results from the morphometry of the kidneys of fourteen species (Table 2 / 1) showed that desert species have long papillae which contain a limited amount of connective tissue. The metachromatic staining of extracellular acid mucopolysaccharides extends further towards the cortex in those species which can secrete highly concentrated urine. On the other hand, the papillae of animals which habitually produce dilute urine were squat in outline and contained abundant connective tissue. The tip of the papilla in these species was not found to stain set metachromatically. The extent of metachromasia was thus found to be related to the development of high tonicity in vivo, and thus to be most prominent in that part of the papilla where the sodium concentration is greatest in life. It was observed histologically that acid mucopolysaccharide was associated with the lateral spaces between collecting tubule cells in the guinea pig. It had been suggested by Ginetzinsky in 1958 that the material found between these cells in the rat constituted the barrier between fluid in the collecting tubule lumen and the interstitium. He postulated that antidiuretic hormone released hyaluronidase from the apex of the collecting tubule cell and that the enzyme then digested the intercellular cement permitting tubular fluid to equilibrate osmotically with the interstitium. The material between collecting tubule cells the guinea pig was extracted and information about its nature was obtained from its behaviour in electrophoresis and from its staining characteristics. It was found to be a very soluble acid mucopolysaccharide which contained sulphate and PAS positive groups, both of which features distinguish it from hyaluronic acid. The histological technique had thus to be modified to preserve as much as possible of the material in the thin (3 andnbsp;andmu;) wax sections required for the optimal demonstration of this region in the light microscope. The fixative developed to give the most satisfactory retention of acid mucopolysaccharide at the same time as preserving cytological structure reasonably well was as follows: Formol (40 % CHO) 100 ml Cellosolve 225 ml Distilled water 45 ml Aminoacridine hydrochloride 1. 6 gm. After fixation the tissue blocks were passed directly into pure cellosolve: Rinsing in aqueous solutions was avoided. Aminoacridine hydrochloride is soluble in cellosolve hence excess precipitant was removed during dehydration without running the risk that acid mucopolysaccharide might be leached out. The blocks were cleared in the usual way and then embedded in ester wax which was found to be superior to paraffin wax for a number of reasons discussed in Chapter 4. Radioactive sulphate was used to trace the synthesis of acid mucopolysaccharide by the collecting tubule cells. After injection of the label, radioactivity was first seen in sections to be associated with PAS positive, amylase resistant granules in the Golgi regions of the collecting tubule cells. After longer intervals radioactivity became associated with granules near the apical and lateral borders of the cells. The Golgi region as demonstrated morphologically (Chapter 3) was always seen to be between the nucleus and apical or lateral borders of the cell and never between the nucleus and the base. Similarly, material which had incorporated radioactive sulphate was never seen to pass across the base of a collecting tubule cell. The reasons for associating the development of an extensive Golgi region with the synthesis of acid mucopolysaccharide by these cells is discussed in connection with the results published by others working with embryonically similar gut cells. It proved possible by autoradiography to identify positively the material in the biochemical extract that had come from the collecting tubule cells. Autoradiography of tissue sections one hour after injection of the label showed that radioactivity was limited to the collecting tubule cells: Similarly only one band in the electrophoretic separation of acid mucopolysaccharides extracted from the papilla after this interval contained radioactivity. By noting how this band stained before and after the action of enzymes upon the material within it, it was concluded that the material associated with collecting tubule cells had the following features: It contained protein which could not be digested by papain. It contained a limited amount of 'neutral' polysaccharide which could be stained by the PAS routine. It could not be digested by amylase. It stained as strongly at pH 1 with Alcian Blue as it did at pH 3. 5 : This indicated that its anionic groups were sulphate and that carboxyl groups placed little part in the staining. It incorporated radioactive sulphate. The acid mucopolysaccharide component was partially degraded by commercial bovine testicular hyaluronidase. In Chapter 5 the changes in the morphology of acid mucopolysaccharides in the interstitium and between collecting tubule cells that arise when guinea pigs are dehydrated, injected with ADH or hyaluronidase, or given a water load are recorded. In animals given a water load the structural fibrils of the papillary interstitium become widely separated and, at the same time, the apparent space between tubules is increased. However, morphometry showed that the actual volume of the interstitium did not alter significantly whether the animal was water laden, deprived of water or injected with ADH. The significance of this observation is discussed in view of the contrary reports concerning changes in interstitial volumes: In the present study it was concluded that hydration of the acid mucopolysaccharide gel trapped within the fibrils accounted for their expanded appearance in diuresis. In antidiuresis papillary tubules were closely packed and a number of thin walled vessels, which were not normally observed by light microscopy appeared to be pulled open. This observation could be explained by contraction of interstitial cells under the influence of ADH, or by an increased force exerted on certain fibrils in the interstitium as a result of local changes in the physical propertied of acid mucopolysaccharides. No evidence could be found in this study to support active contraction of the interstitial cells. A model (Fig. 6 / 3) is presented to explain how a system of fibrils ad hyaluronic acid could enable water to be removed from the papilla in antidiuresis without a reduction in the tonicity of the papilla as a whole. The difference in volume of collecting tubule cells in hydration and dehydration was measured. In both cases the basal width of the cells averaged 9. 4 andnbsp;andmu; under the conditions of measurement. The average length of the cells in hydration was 13 andnbsp;andmu; falling to 10 andnbsp;andmu; on ADH infection or water deprivation. The change from columnar to cuboidal shape decreased the cell volume by 23 %. Autoradiographic evidence was obtained which showed that the acid mucopolysaccharide associated with the apex of the collecting tubule cell was depolymerized in antidiuresis. The removal of a layer of acid mucopolysaccharide from this site could account for most of the volume change noted 1 n sections not stained for acid mucopolysaccharides. It was possible that there was also some shrinkage of the cytoplasmic volume by osmosis in antidiuresis but the evidence for this was equivocal. There was nothing in the results from this study to support the hypothesis that hyaluronidase was released by apocrine secretion from the collecting tubule cells. 'Granules' of a size which could just be resolved optically (ie. of andfrac 14; to andfrac 12;andnbsp;andmu; in dia.) could be seen between collecting tubule cells (fig. 4 / 6). These 'granules' contained anionic groups which stained in the same way as the material at the apex of the cells. The resolution that is possible with light microscopical autoradiography was insufficient to prove that these particles incorporated sulphate in parallel with the apical material. The arrangement of the Golgi region in these cells (fig. 3 / 12) suggested that secretion took place into the lateral intercellular spaces as well as across the apex. However, granules were never seen between the cells in the electron microscope, and it is suggested that the granular appearance of this region in the light microscope arises from the plane of section of the cellular interdigitations. The amount of acid mucopolysaccharide between collecting tubule cells wan reduced when guinea pigs were deprived of water or given ADH. Removal of apical material with preservation of that between cells, or vice versa, was never observed. This result is discussed in Chapter 6, and a model is put forward to explain how such a system could regulate the flow of water across the collecting tubule wall. The evidence arising from studies by other workers which suggests a role for a hyaluronic acid/hyaluronidase system in the physiology of the kidney is reviewed in Chapter 6 : This, and the criticism of the hypothesis of Ginetzinsky (1958) is discussed in the light of findings in the present study. It is concluded that renal acid mucopolysaccharides are involved in maintaining the constancy of the 'milieu interior' of the papilla, which determines that of the blood and ultimately of the whole body. It is thought that an understanding of the actual mechanisms by which they do this has probably been delayed by the modern emphasis on cellular activity with the result that the functional significance of connective tissue has tended to be overlooked. </p...|$|R
