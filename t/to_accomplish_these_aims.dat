The first is to examine a {{fundamental}} difference in the way of being of humans and that of the natural world. The second is to chart the dangers, responsibilities and possibilities of the human realm conferred by that difference. In order <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> <b>these</b> two <b>aims</b> I draw on the philosophical thought of Martin Heidegger and the poetry, prose and correspondence of Rainer Maria Rilke. A desire to approach non-human forms in an intense and sustained manner fires the first intention. The latter, finding its genesis in the knowledge imparted through such encounters, and firmly convinced of both their rarity and importance in the scope of the human domain, is concerned with the difficulties facing the pursuit of such experiences and, once attained, how such encounters can contribute to the protection of these non-human forms. The first part (chapters 2 to 4) is occupied with developing a largely theoretical account of the non-human world and an outline and 'diagnosis' of the problems of the human realm. The last part (chapters 5 and 6) is 'moral' and practical in temper, and moves toward a 'cure' to the difficulties outlined in the first part...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} effects of an informal exclusionary institution on local socio-economic outcomes. Specifically, focusing on the Afro-descendant population, it analyzes {{the effects of}} the informal institution of racial exclusion on local socio-economic outcomes in Colombia {{in the late nineteenth and}} mid-twentieth centuries. The study pursues two major research aims. First, I identify the effect of racial exclusion on socio-economic outcomes. Second, I study how racial exclusion and socio-economic outcomes are causally linked. In other words, I identify a theoretical mechanism. In order <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> <b>these</b> research <b>aims,</b> I take a multimethod approach. I use quantitative techniques to estimate the effects of racial exclusion on socio-economic outcomes, and I apply qualitative theory-building process-tracing to identify a theoretical mechanism between racial exclusion and socio-economic outcomes – namely, public good provision. The quantitative results show that racial exclusion has negative effects on socio-economic outcomes in the Colombian case. They indicate that municipalities with a higher share of Afro-descendant individuals have a lower provision of public goods for development, and a lower level of economic performance. The qualitative analysis identifies a theoretical “mechanism of reaction” between the informal exclusionary institution and local socio-economic outcomes. According to this hypothesis, the informal institution of racial exclusion shapes three specific actors: non-aggrieved actors, mid-aggrieved actors, and aggrieved actors, all of whom react to the exclusionary institution by displaying five different types of behavior: adoption, adaptation, non-cooperation, revision, and contestation of the informal exclusionary institution. These types of behavior, in turn, either alter or reinforce the informal exclusionary institution. The results indicate that alterations and reinforcements have effects on socio-economic outcomes when actors’ behavior is related to initiatives for the local political economy of public good provision. Hence, behavior such as adoption, adaptation, and non-cooperation facilitates low public good provision. In contrast, revision and contestation tend to facilitate effective initiatives for better public good provision. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>To</b> <b>accomplish</b> <b>these</b> <b>aims,</b> many {{different}} types of materials are employed in the design and construction of systems. For instance, common endothermic building materials include calcium silicate board, concrete and gypsum wallboard. During fire testing of concrete floor slabs, water can be seen to boil out of a slab. Gypsum wall board typically loses all its strength during a fire. The use of endothermic materials is established and proven to be sound engineering practice. The chemically bound water inside these materials sublimes. During this process, the unexposed side cannot exceed the boiling point of water. Once the hydrates are spent, the temperature on the unexposed side of an endothermic fire barrier tends to rise rapidly. Too much water can be a problem, however. Concrete slabs that are too wet, will literally explode in a fire, which is why test laboratories insist on measuring water content of concrete and mortar in fire test specimens, before running any fire tests. PFP measures can also include intumescents and ablative materials. The point is, however, that whatever the nature of the materials, they on their own bear no rating. They must be organised into systems, which bear a rating when installed in accordance with certification listings or established catalogues, such as DIN 4102 Part 4 or the Canadian National Building Code.|$|E

There is currently no study assessing ACL patients following surgery in Egypt (or other Arabic countries) or in {{people who are not}} from competitive sports background. The aims of this thesis were to evaluate {{the quantity and quality of}} functional performance, postural stability and rehabilitative outcomes of non-high competitive sports patients following ACL reconstruction in Egypt. <b>To</b> <b>accomplish</b> <b>these</b> research <b>aims,</b> five separate studies were performed; Study one: A systematic scoping review of the ACL reconstructed patients’ outcomes and the measures used to evaluate them following the surgery including functional performance testing and patient reported questionnaires. The findings of this review suggested a more extensive series of tests to measure both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of functional performance and control stability for people participating in non competitive sports and who had the ACL reconstruction. Also The KOOS and the IKDC questionnaires are both measures that are increasingly being used for ACL reconstruction throughout the last decade; Study two: One hundred and twenty nine Egyptian patients were included to assess the reliability and validity of an Arabic version of the Knee KOOS. The results demonstrated acceptable psychometric characteristics of the Arabic version of KOOS with similar qualities to the original American-English language version among the Egyptian population. Study three: Four subjects and four assessors were involved in this preliminary study to assess the test retest (inter- intra tester) reliability of a qualitative scoring system of limb alignment during single leg squat (QASLS). The results indicated that the qualitative evaluation method may allow clinicians and researcher to standardize the categorization of functional movements of singe-leg loading such as the SLS regardless of the equipment, time and a venue.

40|$|Abstract Background Much {{has been}} written about how the medical home model can enhance patient-centeredness, care continuity, and follow-up, but few {{comprehensive}} aids or resources exist <b>to</b> help practices <b>accomplish</b> <b>these</b> <b>aims.</b> The complexity of primary care can overwhelm those concerned with quality improvement. Methods The RE-AIM planning and evaluation model was used to develop a multimedia, multiple-health behavior tool with psychosocial assessment and feedback features to facilitate and guide patient-centered communication, care, and follow-up related to prevention and self-management of the most common adult chronic illnesses seen in primary care. Results The Connection to Health Patient Self-Management System, a web-based patient assessment and support resource, was developed using the RE-AIM factors of reach (e. g., allowing input and output via choice of different modalities), effectiveness (e. g., using evidence-based intervention strategies), adoption (e. g., assistance in integrating the system into practice workflows and permitting customization of the website and feedback materials by practice teams), implementation (e. g., identifying and targeting actionable priority behavioral and psychosocial issues for patients and teams), and maintenance/sustainability (e. g., integration with current National Committee for Quality Assurance recommendations and clinical pathways of care). Connection to Health can work on a variety of input and output platforms, and assesses and provides feedback on multiple health behaviors and multiple chronic conditions frequently managed in adult primary care. As such, it should help to make patient-healthcare team encounters more informed and patient-centered. Formative research with clinicians indicated that the program addressed a number of practical concerns and they appreciated the flexibility and how the Connection to Health program could be customized to their office. Conclusions This primary care practice tool based on an implementation science model has the potential to guide patients to more healthful behaviors and improved self-management of chronic conditions, while fostering effective and efficient communication between patients and their healthcare team. RE-AIM and similar models can help clinicians and media developers create practical products more likely to be widely adopted, feasible in busy medical practices, and able to produce public health impact. </p...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, energy-efficiency is {{becoming}} more and more a decisive parameter for digital systems, driven by the ever increasing number of portable applications. Mobile phones are an obvious example, but many other portable electronic devices are emerging which have less stringent speed requirements but even more critical energy requirements. Since their stand-alone time is dependent on the fixed available energy budget, research toward significant improvements in energy consumption per operation is paramount. Especially medical applications such as biomedical sensor nodes can benefit greatly from a drastically increased energy-efficiency. By extremely reducing the supply voltage of digital CMOS circuits, their dynamic energy consumption decreases quadratically. Therefore, operating digital systems at ultra-low supply voltages can result in significant energy savings. However, ultra-low-voltage circuits pose many challenges as well. The current decreases exponentially, causing the delay to increase considerably. Hence, inherently, it is only possible to achieve low to moderate circuit performance. Circuits operating at such low supply voltages are much more sensitive to variations, which can severely compromise the yield. Moreover, the decreased current ratios pose a threat to reliable functionality of the circuits. This thesis aims to design ultra-low-voltage digital circuits which are not only energy-efficient, but also provide answers to these various challenges. A focus is given toward designing variation-resilient circuits, as this is key to guarantee high yield. Additionally, operating frequencies of nx 10 MHz are targeted to establish ultra-low-voltage systems as an attractive option for industrial applications. <b>To</b> <b>accomplish</b> <b>these</b> various research <b>aims,</b> careful attention must be paid to all abstraction levels of digital design. Therefore, a complete design methodology is presented, which follows a bottom-up approach from transistor-level circuit design up to architecture-level recommendations. This ultra-low-voltage design strategy is generally applicable for all types of signal processing applications. This is demonstrated by four implemented prototypes: three datapath elements, i. e. a logarithmic adder and two multiply-accumulate units, and a full JPEG encoder in 90 nm and 40 nm CMOS technologies. These prototypes have successfully obtained the predefined research goals and have thereby succeeded to effectively validate the proposed design methodology. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Computer {{networks}} {{are becoming increasingly}} large and complex; more so with the recent penetration of the internet into all walks of life. It is essential {{to be able to}} monitor and to analyse networks in a timely and efficient manner; to extract important metrics and measurements and to do so in a way which does not unduly disturb or affect the performance of the network under test. Network tomography is one possible method <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> <b>these</b> <b>aims.</b> Drawing upon the principles of statistical inference, it is often possible to determine the statistical properties of either the links or the paths of the network, whichever is desired, by measuring at the most convenient points thus reducing the effort required. In particular, bottleneck-link detection methods in which estimates of the delay distributions on network links are inferred from measurements made at end-points on network paths, are examined as a means to determine which links of the network are experiencing the highest delay. Initially two published methods, one based upon a single Gaussian distribution and the other based upon the method-of-moments, are examined by comparing their performance using three metrics: robustness to scaling, bottleneck detection accuracy and computational complexity...|$|E
