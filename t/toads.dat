5|$|Around 150 cane <b>toads</b> were {{introduced}} to Oahu in Hawaii in 1932, and the population swelled to 105,517 after 17months. The <b>toads</b> {{were sent to the}} other islands, and more than 100,000 <b>toads</b> were distributed by July 1934; eventually over 600,000 were transported.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>toads</b> {{are usually}} solitary animals, in the {{breeding}} season, {{large numbers of}} <b>toads</b> converge on certain breeding ponds, where the males compete to mate with the females. Eggs are laid in gelatinous strings {{in the water and}} later hatch out into tadpoles. After several months of growth and development, these sprout limbs and undergo metamorphosis into tiny <b>toads.</b> The juveniles emerge from the water and remain largely terrestrial {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
5|$|Common <b>toads</b> {{can live}} {{for many years}} and have survived for fifty years in captivity. In the wild, common <b>toads</b> are thought to live for about ten to twelve years.

Tiger salamanders, found in grassland and near major drainages, are the only salamander species known in Arizona. Woodhouse’s <b>toads,</b> which are seldom seen, are the largest <b>toads</b> in the park. They like grasslands, riparian corridors, and developed areas. Red-spotted <b>toads,</b> most active in the rainy season, July through September, are found in rocky areas near streams and in canyons. The Great Plains toad, the most common toad in the park, prefers grasslands. Resident spadefoot <b>toads</b> include the New Mexico, plains, and Couch's varieties.|$|E

5|$|The {{cane toad}} was {{introduced}} into New Guinea {{to control the}} hawk moth larvae eating sweet potato crops. The first release occurred in 1937 using <b>toads</b> imported from Hawaii, with a second release the same year using specimens from the Australian mainland. Evidence suggests a third release in 1938, consisting of <b>toads</b> being used for human pregnancy testsmany species of toad {{were found to be}} effective for this task, and were employed for about 20years after the discovery was announced in 1948. Initial reports argued the <b>toads</b> were effective in reducing the levels of cutworms and sweet potato yields were thought to be improving. As a result, these first releases were followed by further distributions across much of the region, although their effectiveness on other crops, such as cabbages, has been questioned; when the <b>toads</b> were released at Wau, the cabbages provided insufficient shelter and the <b>toads</b> rapidly left the immediate area for the superior shelter offered by the forest. A similar situation had previously arisen in the Australian cane fields, but this experience was either unknown or ignored in New Guinea. The cane toad has since become abundant in rural and urban areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{common toad}} was first given the name Rana bufo by the Swedish {{biologist}} Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae in 1758. In this work, he placed all the frogs and <b>toads</b> {{in the single}} genus Rana. It later became apparent that this genus should be divided, and in 1768, the Austrian naturalist Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti placed the common toad in the genus Bufo, naming it Bufo bufo. The <b>toads</b> in this genus {{are included in the}} family Bufonidae, the true <b>toads.</b>|$|E
5|$|The skin of {{the adult}} cane toad is toxic, {{as well as the}} {{enlarged}} parotoid glands behind the eyes, and other glands across their backs. When the <b>toads</b> are threatened, their glands secrete a milky-white fluid known as bufotoxin. Components of bufotoxin are toxic to many animals; even human deaths have been recorded due to the consumption of cane <b>toads.</b>|$|E

5|$|The toad {{has long}} been {{considered}} to be an animal of ill omen or a connection to a spirit world. This may have its origins in {{the fact that it is}} at home both on land and in the water. It may cause repugnance because of its blackish, wart-like skin, its slow movements and the way it emerges from some dark hole. In Europe in the Middle Ages, the toad was associated with the Devil, for whom a coat-of-arms was invented emblazoned with three <b>toads.</b> It was known that the toad could poison people and, as the witch's familiar, it was thought to possess magical powers. Even ordinary people made use of dried <b>toads,</b> their bile, faeces and blood. In some areas, the finding of a toad in a house was considered evidence that a witch was present. In the Basque Country, the familiars were believed to be <b>toads</b> wearing elegant robes. These were herded by children who were being trained as witches. Between 1610 and 1612, the Spanish inquisitor Alonso de Salazar Frías investigated witchcraft in the region and searched the houses of suspected witches for dressed <b>toads.</b> He found none. These witches were reputed to use undomesticated <b>toads</b> as ingredients in their liniments and brews.|$|E
5|$|Battletoads Arcade is a coin-operated, {{scrolling}} beat 'em up arcade video game. Up {{to three}} players, as the Battletoads (Rash, Pimple, and Zitz), punch and kick oncoming enemies through six levels {{to save their}} alternate universe from the Dark Queen. Arcade was the first Battletoads game to feature three-player cooperative multiplayer. Players control their characters with eight-directional joysticks and two buttons (attack and jump). Characters can run if the player pushes the joystick twice in the same direction. The <b>Toads</b> vary in fighting style: Rash is nimble, Pimple is burly, and Zitz is a balance of the two. As customary for the series, the <b>Toads</b> can knocked enemies offscreen such that they appear to fly towards the players, breaking the fourth wall. The <b>Toads</b> can also eat flies to regenerate health. Each Toad has its own signature exaggerated power and attack, in which their limbs turn into objects such as axes and drills. Enemies include aliens, mutant rodents, and snowmen.|$|E
5|$|Iridomyrmex {{primarily}} {{feeds on}} sweet {{foods such as}} nectar and honeydew. They hunt for insects and other ants to feed to their young, and workers are particularly attracted to seeds with elaiosomes. They collect these seeds, remove the elaiosomes, and then discard the seeds. The seedlings that sprout from these seeds benefit from proximity to the aggressive Iridomyrmex ants, giving them {{a better chance of}} survival. Colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds, and so the termites are regularly preyed on by Iridomyrmex; no evidence for any kind of relationship (other than a predatory one) is known. Juvenile cane <b>toads</b> are often preyed on, as certain Iridomyrmex species such as I. purpureus and I. ruburrus are immune to the toxins released by the cane <b>toads.</b> As a result, placing Iridomyrmex nests in habitats which house cane <b>toads</b> have been suggested as a method of controlling the cane toad population. The meat ant is the only known ant in Australia that feeds on guano.|$|E

5|$|The males arrive {{first and}} remain in the {{location}} for several weeks while the females only stay long enough to mate and spawn. Rather than fighting {{for the right to}} mate with a female, male <b>toads</b> may settle disputes by means of the pitch of their voice. Croaking provides a reliable sign of body size and hence of prowess. Nevertheless, fights occur in some instances. In a study at one pond where males outnumbered females by four or five to one, it was found that 38% of the males won the right to mate by defeating rivals in combat or by displacing other males already mounted on females. Male <b>toads</b> generally outnumber female <b>toads</b> at breeding ponds. A Swedish study found that female mortality was higher than that of males and that 41% of females did not come to the breeding pond in the spring and missed a year before reproducing again.|$|E
5|$|Two {{sites were}} chosen to {{study the effects of}} cane <b>toads</b> on the {{northern}} quoll, one of which was at Mary River ranger station, which is located in the southern region of Kakadu National Park. The other site was located {{at the north end of}} the park. In addition to these two sites, there was a third site located at the East Alligator ranger station, and this site was used as a control site, where the cane <b>toads</b> would not interact with the northern quoll population. Monitoring of the quoll population began at the Mary River ranger station using radio tracking in 2002, months before the first cane <b>toads</b> arrived at the site. After the arrival of the cane <b>toads,</b> the population of northern quolls in the Mary River site plummeted between October and December 2002, and by March 2003, the northern quoll appeared to be extinct in this section of the park, as there were no northern quolls caught in the trapping trips in the following two months. In contrast, the population of northern quolls in the control site at the East Alligator ranger station remained relatively constant, not showing any symptoms of declining. The evidence from the Kakadu National Park is compelling not only because of the timing of the population of northern quolls plummeting just months after the arrival of the cane toad, but also because in the Mary River region 31% of mortalities within the quoll population were attributed to lethal toxic ingestion, as there were no signs of disease, parasite infestation, or any other obvious changes at the site that could have caused such a rapid decline. The most obvious piece of evidence which supports the hypothesis that the invasion of the cane <b>toads</b> caused the local extinction of the northern quoll is that the closely monitored population of the control group, in the absence of cane <b>toads,</b> showed no signs of decline.|$|E
