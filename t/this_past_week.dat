But yeah, last week we sat around and they played me some new stuff they're working on, and it sounds good. Sounds like it's got a lot of promise, and really they just need me in the fuckin' practice room. So all {{this is going to happen}} this year. It has to happen. I know there's a responsibility here. Down has a fanbase and they are very very very loyal. So I don't want to let those people down. They deserve some new music, we have it. We've demoed other songs, there's songs that haven't even been released that people have never heard, so there's always Down there. For all you people out there, don't you stress. We got the Down coming." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hello Folks, Donna Deegan here. For {{those of}} you who haven't been {{watching}} <b>this</b> <b>past</b> <b>week,</b> where've you been? Seriously, if you haven't had the time to tune in, I have changed my name to, well, my name. So many of you have e-mailed to say [...] "Hey Donna, it's about time!" [...] Well, fortunately the station thought so too. Tim and I have been married for more than five years, and I have been Deegan everywhere but on the air since then. So why now? Well, there is no great strategy here. For some time now the station has been putting together a new look for our news opens, graphics etc. That's a big deal and very expensive so it's not done very often. While making those plans they very graciously asked if I would like to change my on-air name. I talked it over with my kids and with Tim and everyone said [...] "go for it" [...] so I did. That simple. The decision {{had nothing to do with}} my recent recurrence. It will be fun to see if I can actually call myself the correct name every day. Between chemo and my normal space cadet nature, I think the betting pool is in full swing.|$|E
2500|$|Jovita O'Shaughnessy {{received}} an Australian Director's Guild nomination for Best Direction in a TV Drama Serial for Episode 6472, which featured {{the aftermath of}} the crash. Brygel proclaimed that the Ramsay Street crash was [...] "undoubtedly the most dramatic and shocking Neighbours storyline of the year so far". Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap named the storyline [...] "Nightmare on Ramsay Street" [...] and called the crash [...] "terrifying". Jaci Stephen from the Daily Mail wrote [...] "How often do I have to say it? Get some flamin' driving lessons! Is anyone actually capable of taking to the road without ending up in a car wreck?" [...] She believed that it was [...] "just as well" [...] that Rhys injured his hand, forcing him to cancel his trip to Japan as [...] "the plane would probably have crashed." [...] Stephen continued [...] "At least, on Wednesday, Chris's driving licence is suspended. If only the same could happen to the rest of Erinsborough's residents." [...] Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton stated [...] "I really enjoyed Neighbours <b>this</b> <b>past</b> <b>week.</b> The crash and the aftermath made for some really strong storytelling and I'm surprised at how prominent Chris has been in the storyline." [...] Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly branded the crash one of the soap's [...] "biggest episodes of the year".|$|E

5000|$|I wouldn't {{say that}} <b>this</b> <b>past</b> <b>week's</b> Parks and Recreation was a stand-out, {{but it did}} offer {{up a lot of}} great {{character}} moments between Ron and Leslie which culminated in another warm reciprocation of respect and admiration, {{along the lines of the}} superior episodes [...] "Sweetums" [...] and [...] "Hunting Trip". Matt Fowler, IGN [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] received generally positive reviews. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] one of the best episodes of the second season, particularly complimenting the one-liner jokes and ensemble cast performances. Gonzalez said she particularly liked the [...] "big brother-little sister vibe" [...] between Leslie and Ron. The Star-Ledger television columnist Alan Sepinwall said [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] was well-executed because revealing to the viewers that Ron was going to tease Leslie made his pranks more humorous and less mean-spirited. Sepinwall also said the episode had several good moments for the supporting characters, including Andy's selfless act toward Tom and Donna's purchase of shares with the nightclub. The A.V. Club writer Steve Heisler said he liked that Ron genuinely cares for Leslie. Heisler said: [...] "If he resented Leslie as much as he hinted at during season one, it'd become an ongoing thorn in the show's foot that during every single episode. ... Getting along is underrated in comedy." ...|$|R

6000|$|To {{return to}} the Claim. I find myself greatly embarrassed by Mrs. Eddy's remark: [...] "I regard self-deification as blasphemous." [...] If she is right about that, I have written a half-ream of {{manuscript}} <b>this</b> <b>past</b> <b>week</b> which I must not print, either in the book which I am writing, or elsewhere: for it goes into that very matter with extensive elaboration, citing, in detail, words and acts of Mrs. Eddy's which {{seem to me to}} prove that she is a faithful and untiring worshipper of herself, and has carried self-deification to a length which has not been before ventured in ages. If ever. There is not room enough in this chapter for that Survey, but I can epitomize a portion of it here.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Blood {{smiled and}} {{inclined}} his head, {{for he was}} on friendly terms with these ladies, one of whom, indeed, had been {{for a little while}} his patient. But there was no response to his greeting. Instead, the eyes gave him back a stare of cold disdain. The smile on his thin lips grew a little broader, a little less pleasant. He understood the reason of that hostility, which had been daily growing in <b>this</b> <b>past</b> <b>week</b> since Monmouth had come to turn the brains of women of all ages. The Misses Pitt, he apprehended, contemned him that he, a young and vigorous man, of a military training which might now be valuable to the Cause, should stand aloof; that he should placidly smoke his pipe and tend his geraniums on this evening of all evenings, when men of spirit were rallying to the Protestant Champion, offering their blood to place him on the throne where he belonged.|$|E
6000|$|... ...The Nightmare of the Edition (of my Works!) is {{the real}} mot de l'Enigme of all my long gaps and delinquencies these many months past--my terror of not keeping {{sufficiently}} ahead in doing my part of it (all the revising, rewriting, retouching, Preface-making and proof-correcting) has so paralysed me--as a panic fear--that I have let other decencies go to the wall. The printers and publishers tread on my heels, and I feel their hot breath behind me--whereby I keep at it {{in order not to}} be overtaken. Fortunately I have kept at it so that I am almost out of the wood, and the next very few weeks or so will completely lay the spectre. The case has been complicated badly, moreover, the last month--and even before--by my having, of all things in the world, let myself be drawn into a theatrical adventure--which fortunately appears to have turned out as well as I could have possibly expected or desired. Forbes Robertson and his wife produced on the 26th last in Edinburgh--being on [...] "tour," [...] and the provincial production to begin with, as more experimental, having good reason in its favour--a three-act comedy of mine ("The High Bid")--which is just only the little one-act play presented as a [...] "tale" [...] {{at the end of the}} volume of the [...] "Two Magics"; the one-act play proving really a perfect three-act one, dividing itself (by two short entractes, without fiddles) perfectly at the right little places as climaxes--with the artful beauty of unity of time and place preserved, etc.... It had a great and charming success before a big house at Edinburgh--a real and unmistakable victory--but what was most brought home thereby is that it should have been discharged straight in the face of London. That will be its real and best function. This I am hoping for during May and June. It has still to be done at Newcastle, Liverpool, etc. (was done <b>this</b> <b>past</b> <b>week</b> three times at Glasgow. Of course on tour three times in a week is the most they can give a play in a minor city.) But my great point is that preparations, rehearsals, lavishments of anxious time over it (after completely re-writing it and improving it to begin with) have represented a sacrifice of days and weeks to them that have direfully devoured my scant margin--thus making my intense nervousness (about them) doubly nervous. I left home on the 17th last and rehearsed hard (every blessed day) at Manchester, and at Edinburgh till the production--having already, three weeks before that in London, given up a whole week to the same. I came back to town a week ago to-night (saw a second night in Edinburgh, which confirmed the impression of the first,) and return to L.H. to-morrow, after a very decent huitaine de jours here during which I have had quiet mornings, and even evenings, of work. I go to Paris about the 20th to stay 10 days, at the most, with Mrs Wharton, and shall be back by May 1st. I yearn to know positively that your Dad and Mother arrive definitely on the Oxford job then. I have had to be horribly inhuman to them in respect to the fond or repeated expression of that yearning--but they will more than understand why, [...] "druv" [...] as I've been, and also understand how the prospect of having them with me, and being with them, for a while, has been all these last months as the immediate jewel of my spur. Read them this letter and let it convey to them, all tenderly, that I live in the hope of their operative advent, and shall bleed half to death if there be any hitch.|$|E
