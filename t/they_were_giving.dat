You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>giving</b> me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E
25|$|Corporals Pares and Gill, {{were doing}} an {{excellent}} job. Gill would look through his sniper scope and tell Pares where the enemy were and Pares would fire ten rounds rapid, {{and as soon}} as that got them on the move, Gill would take them out with the sniper rifle. They took out four or five this way and all the time <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>giving</b> the rest of us a running commentary.|$|E
25|$|The militants {{opened fire}} {{on a group of}} IDF {{soldiers}} from the Artillery Corps, who were safeguarding civilian workers who were constructing the border fence. The militants began the attack when they opened fire at a small group of IDF soldiers, shooting at them from approximately hundred meters, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>giving</b> water to a group of 10 illegal immigrants from Africa who were crossing the border as well.|$|E

We conjecture also formulae for the non-perturbative thresholds in lower dimensional compactifications...|$|R
25|$|The {{political}} prisoners {{were kept in}} various jails around the country. When an international human rights commission came to Argentina in 1979 to assess {{the conditions of the}} prisoners, the Videla regime decided to move a group of high profile prisoners to Caseros, inaugurating the new cárcel de Caseros with great pomp, as a way of showing the international community the respect and care <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>giving</b> to their {{political prisoners}}.|$|E
25|$|It's like St. Patrick's Day. I {{came out}} of respect for what my people are doing, not because I believe it will do any good. I thought it would do some good in the beginning. But when the march started to get all the {{official}} approval from Mastah Kennedy, Mastah Wagner, Mastah Spellman, and they started setting limits on how we had to march peacefully, I knew that the march {{was going to be a}} mockery, that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>giving</b> us something again.|$|E
25|$|Man Chong sent {{in another}} {{memorial}} {{to argue that}} his plan would work because it would mislead the Wu forces into thinking that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>giving</b> up on Hefei and lure them deeper into Wei territory, where they would lose their advantage in naval warfare and become more vulnerable. He also quoted lines from The Art of War in his memorial to support his point on using deception to lure the enemy into a trap. Zhao Zi (趙咨), a Wei official, supported Man Chong's idea and managed to convince Cao Rui to approve it.|$|E

25|$|The militants {{began their}} attack when they opened fire {{at a small}} group of IDF soldiers, {{shooting}} at them from a distance of approximately one hundred meters, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>giving</b> water to a group of 10 illegal immigrants from Africa who were crossing the border into Israel as well. During the incident, which was thwarted at a relatively early stage by IDF forces at the site, one Israeli soldier was killed by the militants and another was moderately injured. Both of the soldiers were graduates of Hesder yeshivas. The three militants were killed in the ensuing gunfight, {{and one of them was}} killed by a female combat soldier from the mixed-gender Caracal Battalion.|$|E
25|$|Sponsor Philip Morris did {{not want}} to show day-old kinescopes to the major markets on the East Coast, yet neither did they want to pay for the extra cost that filming, processing, and editing would require, {{pressuring}} Ball and Arnaz to relocate to New York City. Ball and Arnaz offered to take a pay cut to finance filming, on the condition that their company, Desilu, would retain the rights to that film once it was aired. CBS relinquished the show rights to Desilu after initial broadcast, not realizing <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>giving</b> away a valuable and durable asset. In 1957, CBS bought the rights back for $1,000,000 ($ in today's terms), which provided Ball and Arnaz the down payment for the purchase of the former RKO Pictures studios, which became Desilu Studios.|$|E
25|$|However, {{things were}} not going {{according}} to Bitar's and Aflaq's plan. The reconstituted party was divided into many factions which differed on policy issues, {{but most of them}} supported Aflaq's ouster as Secretary General of the National Command. Immediately after the attempted coup, Aflaq and Bitar re-delegated basic organizational work to Hammud al-Shufithe eventual Regional Secretary of the Syrian Regional Branch. By doing this, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>giving</b> momentum to their opponents. Shufi, who was at first believed to be an Aflaq supporter, was a radical Marxist. Shufi's group, which controlled the Syrian Regional Command, became allies of the Military Committee in their fight to topple Aflaq and Bitar. Aflaq and Bitar could not rely upon support in the National Command from the Iraqis; the Iraqi Regional Branch had undergone a sudden radicalization under the leadership of Ali Salih al-Sadi. A moderate faction within the Iraqi Regional Branch, headed by Talib El-Shibib and Hazim Jawad, still supported the National Command.|$|E

25|$|Fighting {{units and}} mobilization. In the heavily forested regions of West, Central and South-Central Africa, the foot soldier held sway. Most {{states did not}} {{maintain}} standing armies, but mobilized fighting men as needed. Rulers often built up a royal or palace guard as an elite force, sometimes using slaves. These formed a permanent, professional nucleus around which the general purpose levies were mustered. The heavy, shield-bearing infantry of the Angolan region (West Central Africa) are an illustration of these more professionalized forces. The general-purpose levies were drawn upon in a more localized manner and were expected to furnish their own weapons and rations when mustered for combat. They were generally mobilized when war was imminent and demobilized when the crisis was over. While they did not see as much service as male troops in the field, the most unusual example of an elite force is in Dahomey, where a special corps of female warriors guarded {{the person of the}} monarch. These 'Amazons' also carried out various functions of state such as auditing the accounts of sub-chiefs to determine if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>giving</b> the king his proper share of taxes collected. Logistics was not highly organized. Porters and canoes were pressed into service on the campaign trail, but most armies ultimately lived off the land. Success often hinged on the ability of the defenders or attackers to sustain themselves in the field.|$|E
25|$|The CNDH {{suggested}} after Bermúdez Zacarías' {{murder to}} create a policy to have judges handle cases anonymously {{in order to protect}} their identity. They argued that by having this policy in place, judges would be able to preside over cases impartially and without being intimidated. This method was used in Peru, Colombia, and Italy to protect judges who faced threats from armed groups. The Mexican government stated that they would debate and consider the proposal as an option, but said that accepting the policy would mean that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>giving</b> in to the pressures from organized crime. Moreover, the 2016 judicial reform – the New Criminal Justice System (Spanish: Nuevo Sistema de Justicia Penal, NSJP) – advocated for greater judicial transparency, a move that was seen at odds with the proposed policy. When Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered, only 70 out of 1,391 federal judges had security measures in place to protect them from attacks. Several judges advocated for more security measures, but this also posed several challenges because of the limited resources and long processes that would need to take place for such budgets to be approved by politicians. Local judges, however, do not enjoy the level of protection that their federal counterparts have, and attacks from organized crime members are more prevalent. In addition, most of the cases involving attacks or intimidation against judges are not reported to the police. If the cases are filed to the police, many of them do not reach a court of law and are closed without imparting justice.|$|E

500|$|The {{company has}} owned {{numerous}} minor league hockey teams over the years, which {{have served as}} developmental farm teams for the Maple Leafs. A group backed by Smythe and Frank Selke of the Montreal Canadiens was awarded an American Hockey League (AHL) franchise for Rochester, New York in July 1956, after a local group could {{not come up with}} the US$150,000 in capital required by the league. The Leafs and Canadiens would each own 27.5% of the team, with the balance sold to Rochester interests. [...] The team was named the Rochester Americans. [...] The Amerks were a joint affiliate of both the Canadiens and the Maple Leafs, though the club was operated by the Canadiens. In the summer of 1959 the Maple Leafs bought out the Canadiens' ownership share of the club, giving them a 55% controlling interest, due to concerns that with Montreal operating the club <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>giving</b> their prospects priority over those of the Leafs. [...] They purchased most of the remaining 45% in 1963, boosting their ownership share to 98% by November 1964. In July 1966 the Maple Leafs sold the team to a group which included their then General Manager Punch Imlach for a reported $400,000.|$|E
500|$|Two days later, on 26 August, the Beatles {{travelled}} {{by train}} {{to the college}} campus in Bangor, Wales. It was perhaps {{the first time the}} band had travelled without their tour managers and they had not even thought to bring money. The station was mobbed because of a bank holiday and Cynthia Lennon, mistaken for a fan, was held back. She ran after the train but missed it and arrived later by car. The group, along with Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, Cilla Black, Harrison's sister-in-law Jenny Boyd, and around 300 others, learned the basics of Transcendental Meditation, and were given their mantras. The group [...] "hesitated only slightly" [...] when asked to donate the customary week's wages, a large sum for a Beatle, to learn. While there, they announced at a press conference that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>giving</b> up drugs (apparently referring to psychedelics, but not marijuana). This was a choice [...] "in keeping with the Maharishi's teachings" [...] but one made prior to meeting the Maharishi. The Maharishi did advise them privately to avoid involvement with the [...] "Ban the Bomb" [...] movement and to support the elected government of the day. Their intention was to attend the entire ten-day seminar but their stay was cut short by the death of their manager, Epstein, in London on 27 August. The Maharishi consoled them by saying that Epstein's spirit was still with them and their good thoughts would help him [...] "to have an easy passage" [...] and journey to his [...] "next evolution". According to McCartney, the Maharishi [...] "was great to us when Brian died" [...] and Cynthia Lennon wrote [...] "it was as though, with Brian gone, the four needed someone new to give them direction and the Maharishi was {{in the right place at}} the right time." ...|$|E
