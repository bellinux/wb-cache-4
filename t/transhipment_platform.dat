50|$|Coal traffic ceased in 1988, {{and most}} of the coal {{installations}} were demolished, the coal being transported by road. The Matheysine coalmines were finally closed on March 28, 1997. The SGLM found a new vocation in providing a tourist attraction and as a result, there remain all of the line's historical installations, the workshops, forge, joinery shop, etc. The network's departure and arrival stations were dependent on connections with the PLM railway's Grenoble-Veynes line. The necessary facilities together with the <b>transhipment</b> <b>platform</b> for the automatic transfer of the coal from the SGLM coal cars to the trains operated by PLM (which became SNCF in 1938) were built adjacent to the PLM station, today the station for the Chemin de fer de La Mure.When they last operated, the trains of the railway ran at the leisurely pace of up to 30 km/h.|$|E
50|$|Evidently after 1945, an {{approximately}} 600 metres {{of normal}} gauge freight train was dismantled as reparations {{with the end}} of the Second World War. Since freight traffic on the narrow-gauge line fell in the 1960s, a long timber loading ramp, a <b>transhipment</b> <b>platform</b> and an open transhipment hall were shut down and demolished. On the standard-gauge line, general traffic was handled at the Freital-Potschappel station, so the freight yard was used for other purposes. In 1964, the station's name was changed to Freital-Hainsberg. At the end of the 1970s, freight traffic at Freital-Hainsberg station was still so great that a locomotive of class V 60, which had been specifically installed here, was used. In particular, the provision of wagon loads for the Freital stainless steelworks and the provision of wagon loads for the narrow-gauge line took up the yardâ€™s capacity. The siding to the paper factory, which can be seen on old track plans, no longer exists.|$|E
