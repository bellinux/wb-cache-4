5|$|Brodie's theories—laid {{out in the}} book—of Smith fathering {{children}} through polygamist relationships {{have been among the}} catalysts for professional genetic genealogy studies. During the 2000s, researchers at the Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation used Y-DNA testing to trace the ancestry of descendants of three of the five children whom Brodie suggested, and found that none of <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>were</b> fathered by Smith.|$|E

5|$|Current {{taxonomy}} recognises four subspecies: M. s. splendens in Western Australia, M. s. musgravei {{in central}} Australia (subspecies previously recognised as M. s. callainus), M. s. melanotus in inland eastern Australia and M. s. emmottorum in southwestern Queensland. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>were</b> considered separate species {{as they were}} described far from their borders with other subspecies. However, as the interior of Australia was explored, it became apparent there were areas of hybridisation where subspecies overlapped. Thus in 1975, the first three forms below were reclassified as subspecies of Malurus splendens.|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{mother was}} unable to {{establish}} a role for herself in the regency government and she returned to France in 1217, marrying Hugh de Lusignan, a powerful Poitevin noble. William Marshal fell ill and died in April 1219. The replacement government was formed around a grouping of three senior ministers: Pandulf, the replacement Papal legate; Peter des Roches; and Hubert de Burgh, a former justiciar. <b>The</b> <b>three</b> <b>were</b> appointed by a great council of the nobility at Oxford, and their government came to depend on these councils for authority. Hubert and des Roches were political rivals, with Hubert supported by a network of English barons, and des Roches backed by nobles from the royal territories in Poitou and Touraine. Hubert moved decisively against des Roches in 1221, accusing him of treason and removing him as the King's guardian; the Bishop left England for the crusades. Pandulf was recalled by Rome the same year, leaving Hubert as the dominant force in Henry's government.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Penny {{was named}} {{as one of}} three successors to the {{retiring}} Jay Pritizker besides his son Tom and his cousin Nick. Tom was named the official head of the businesses, Nick and Penny each named vice-chairman. Together, <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>were</b> to oversee the Pritzker family assets. Jay intended to keep the family business together, devising a system of trusts that would allow individual family members to receive money from the trusts to meet their needs; however, the family's wealth was to be primarily maintained in the trusts to grow the businesses and fund philanthropic endeavors. The Pritzker business empire contained over 200 businesses and was valued at $15billion.|$|E

5|$|Keith Richards and Mick Jagger became {{childhood}} {{friends and}} classmates in 1950 in Dartford, Kent, before the Jagger {{family moved to}} Wilmington, five miles (8.05km) away, in 1954. In the mid-1950s, Jagger formed a garage band with his friend Dick Taylor; the group mainly played material by Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Howlin' Wolf and Bo Diddley. Jagger met Richards again in 1960 on Dartford railway station, and the Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters records that Jagger was carrying revealed a common interest. A musical partnership began shortly afterwards. Richards joined Jagger and Taylor at frequent meetings at Jagger's house. The meetings switched to Taylor's house in late 1961, where <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>were</b> joined by Alan Etherington and Bob Beckwith; the quintet called themselves the Blues Boys.|$|E

His main show rivalry was with a dog named Tartar, and along with a dog named Trap, <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>were</b> popular sires of the Fox Terrier breed.

Shortly after this, a grand jury was convened but failed to return any charges against Morehead.|$|E

The first album to contain vocals, That Healin' Feelin' (1970), was commercially unsuccessful and Silver had to insist on the support of Blue Note executives to continue releasing music of the same, new style. They agreed to a further two albums that contained vocals and Silver on an RMI electric keyboard; <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>were</b> later compiled as The United States of Mind, but were soon dropped from the catalog.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{had shown}} the {{potential}} of the Soviet armies to successfully conduct an offensive. This battle can be seen {{as one of the first}} major instances in which the Soviets attempted to preempt a German summer offensive. This later unfolded and grew as Stavka planned and conducted Operation Mars, Operation Uranus and Operation Saturn. Although only two of <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>were</b> victories, it still offers concise and telling evidence of the ability of the Soviets to turn the war in their favor. This finalised itself after the Battle of Kursk in July 1943. The Second Battle of Kharkov also had a positive effect on Stalin, who started to trust his commanders and his Chief of Staff more (allowing the latter to have the last word in naming front commanders for instance). After the great purge in 1937, failing to anticipate the war in 1941, and underestimating German military power in 1942, Stalin finally fully trusted his military.|$|E

In preparing for their roles, Hasiholan exercised slicing and dicing fish, while Rahadian went to Ancol in North Jakarta to learn about dolphins.|$|E
