5|$|Du Bois {{traveled}} to Europe in 1921 {{to attend the}} second Pan-African Congress. The assembled black leaders {{from around the world}} issued the London Resolutions and established a Pan-African Association headquarters in Paris. Under Du Bois's guidance, the resolutions insisted on racial equality, and <b>that</b> <b>Africa</b> be ruled by Africans (not, as in the 1919 congress, with the consent of Africans). Du Bois restated the resolutions of the congress in his Manifesto To the League of Nations, which implored the newly formed League of Nations to address labor issues and to appoint Africans to key posts. The League took little action on the requests.|$|E
5|$|If truly a gondwanathere, TNM02067 {{extends the}} known {{geographic}} {{range of the}} group {{to another part of}} Gondwana, the African mainland. The uncertain age of locality TZ-07 renders a precise assessment of the significance of TNM02067 difficult. It may well be older than the oldest previously known gondwanathere, the Campanian Gondwanatherium. It also has implications for the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>Africa</b> was isolated from the rest of Gondwana from an early dateas early as the early Cretaceousand consequently had a fauna distinct from the rest of Gondwana for much of the Cretaceous, as it may be closely related to the sudamericids of South America, India, Madagascar, and Antarctica, a highly derived group.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} suggested, based on fossil and phylogenetic evidence, that legumes {{originally}} evolved in arid and/or semi-arid regions along the Tethys seaway during the Palaeogene Period.

25|$|The Executive Council of the African Union, {{meeting on}} 7 and 8 March 2005 in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), decided to propose <b>that</b> <b>Africa</b> is {{represented}} by two {{permanent members of the}} Security Council of the UN.

25|$|The Crusader {{was started}} by George Wells Parker, a black {{businessman}} from Omaha, Nebraska, as the official organ of the Hamitic League of the World, a pan-African nationalist group. Parker published articles in the journal proclaiming <b>that</b> <b>Africa</b> was the cradle of civilization and arguing {{the superiority of the}} black race. He contributed financially to the publication, which was essentially a vehicle for his views.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, European {{colonization}} of Africa developed {{rapidly in the}} Scramble for Africa. It is widely believed <b>that</b> <b>Africa</b> had up to 10,000 different states and autonomous groups with distinct languages and customs before it was colonized. Following struggles for independence {{in many parts of}} the continent, as well as a weakened Europe after the Second World War, decolonization took place, culminating in the 1960 Year of Africa.|$|E

25|$|Stewart thought <b>that</b> <b>Africa</b> was {{lagging behind}} other nations. When he first {{traveled}} in Africa, {{he observed that}} magic and medicine were intertwined, which he felt made African medicine inferior to European medicine. He felt that medicine in Africa had a very large presence, but he also felt that it had many malignant effects. He learned some of the natives’ medicine, but thought that European medicine should take precedence over native medicine.|$|E
25|$|Paul Farmer {{also argues}} that the more {{expensive}} a treatment is, {{the harder it is}} for poor countries to get this treatment. The issue of human rights is mentioned here. It was mentioned in this article <b>that</b> <b>Africa</b> {{is at the end of}} the receiving line of treatments because they lack the 'concept of time' which he described as the schedule of administration and this concept hinders their reception of treatment.|$|E
50|$|The Council then demanded <b>that</b> South <b>Africa</b> {{put an end}} to {{its policy}} of bantustans and its {{attempts}} calculated to evade the demands of the United Nations.

40|$|This volume {{reports on}} the {{findings}} of an international research project on aid effectiveness in Africa. Field studies was conducted in Botswana, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Senegal, Tanzania and Zambia and the findings show <b>that</b> <b>Africa's</b> economic crisis has had a devastating effect on aid effectiveness and that too often donors dominate aid decisions, leaving governments without any sense of ownership over their own development efforts. The conclusion is <b>that</b> aid to <b>Africa</b> will have to develop more effective public institutions that fully take charge of the development process...|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, Prof. Odhiambo noted, the {{indigenous}} scientific community in Africa was ‘woefully small’, and the continent was hardly equipped, from a financial and infrastructural point of view, to effectively tackle the challenges at hand. He, therefore, proposed <b>that</b> <b>Africa’s</b> best long term solution towards conducting effective {{research was to}} concentrate efforts in a few centres of excellence.|$|R
25|$|In an August 2010 op-ed, Jim O'Neill of Goldman Sachs argued <b>that</b> <b>Africa</b> {{could be}} {{considered}} the next BRIC. Analysts from rival banks have sought to move beyond the BRIC concept, by introducing their own groupings of emerging markets. Proposals include CIVETs (Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa), the EAGLES (Emerging and Growth-Leading Economies) and the 7 percent club (which includes those countries which have averaged economic growth of at least 7 percent a year).|$|E
25|$|Fra Mauro also {{comments}} that {{the account of}} the expedition, together with the relation by Strabo of the travels of Eudoxus of Cyzicus from Arabia to Gibraltar through the southern Ocean in Antiquity, led him to believe that the Indian Ocean was not a closed sea and <b>that</b> <b>Africa</b> could be circumnavigated by her southern end (Text from Fra Mauro map, 11, G2). This knowledge, together with the map depiction of the African continent, probably encouraged the Portuguese to intensify their effort to round the tip of Africa.|$|E
25|$|Since 206 BC, when Scipio Africanus finally {{expelled}} the Carthaginians from Iberia (see {{the battle}} of Ilipa), he was preoccupied with the idea <b>that</b> <b>Africa</b> should be the next target. To this end he concluded an alliance with Syphax – {{one of the most}} powerful Numidian rulers at the time and an old foe of Carthage – even before he got authority from Rome to lead the future invasion. Even though Scipio was elected consul for 205 BC, he had to endure hard political wrangling before the Senate approved his intentions. His main opponent was Quintus Fabius Maximus Cunctator (the Delayer), who argued that the expedition to Africa was too risky and that the primary objective was to fight Hannibal in Bruttium. Scipio managed to persuade the senators that his plan was the perfect way to force the Carthaginians out of Italy. Nevertheless, he was not given enough resources and had to spend a whole year in preparations.|$|E
25|$|Africa: In a {{literature}} assessment, Boko et al. (2007:435) concluded, with high confidence, <b>that</b> <b>Africa's</b> major economic sectors had been vulnerable to observed climate variability. This vulnerability was judged to {{have contributed to}} Africa's weak adaptive capacity, resulting in Africa having high vulnerability to future climate change. It was thought likely that projected sea-level rise would increase the socio-economic vulnerability of African coastal cities.|$|R

On October 28 it was {{announced}} that they had received substantial pledges; among others, the East African Community has promised 600 personnel, Ethiopia 210, and Congo 200. In total it is hoped <b>that</b> <b>Africa’s</b> contribution will reach 2,000 personnel, of whom one-sixth are currently ready for deployment.|$|R

25|$|Lomborg {{analyzes}} {{three major}} themes: life expectancy, food and hunger, and prosperity, finding that life expectancy and health levels have dramatically improved {{over the past}} centuries, even though several {{regions of the world}} remain threatened, in particular by AIDS. He dismisses Thomas Malthus' theory that increases in the world's population lead to widespread hunger. On the contrary, Lomborg claims that food is widespread, and humanity's daily intake of calories is increasing, and will continue to rise until hunger's eradication, thanks to technological improvements in agriculture. However, Lomborg notes <b>that</b> <b>Africa</b> in particular still produces too little sustenance, an effect he attributes to the continent's dismal economic and political systems. Concerning prosperity, Lomborg argues that wealth, as measured by per capita GDP, should not be the only judging criterion. He points to improvements in education, safety, leisure, and ever more widespread access to consumer goods as signs that prosperity is increasing {{in most parts of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|Africa Vetus ("Old Africa"), {{the land}} {{territory}} of Phoenician Carthage, roughly corresponding to modern northeastern Tunisia, fell into Roman hands {{after the final}} defeat and destruction of Carthage {{at the end of}} the Third Punic War (146 BC). The fertility of its soil was proverbial among the Romans, far greater than it is today. It was populous (ca. 1.5 million inhabitants, roughly the same as contemporary Britain) and was, by 50 BC, the most important source of the City of Rome's grain supply. It was said <b>that</b> <b>Africa</b> fed the Roman populace for 8 months in the year, while Egypt provided the remaining 4 months' supply. The province was a land of vast estates (latifundia) owned by absentee landlords. Pliny the Elder states that in the time of Nero (ruled 54–68), half of all arable land in the province was owned by just six Roman senators. Until 45 BC, the rest of northwest Africa was organised as two Berber Roman satellite-states, Numidia (Tripolitania, western Tunisia/eastern Algeria) and Mauretania (central/western Algeria and Morocco).|$|E
500|$|Similar to {{his first}} African book, Green Hills of Africa, [...] Hemingway embeds in True at First Light digressions and ruminations {{about the nature of}} writing, with {{particular}} attention to James Joyce and D.H. Lawrence. Patrick Hemingway explains his father was interested in D.H. Lawrence's belief that each region of the world [...] "should have its own religion"—apparent when the male character invents his own religion. Mary's intent to decorate a tree for Christmas mystified the native camp members, and Hemingway seemed to realize <b>that</b> <b>Africa</b> was a place without an influential and established religion—a place where religion could be redefined.|$|E
50|$|After a time, Janu left Congo Bill {{for formal}} {{education}} in America. When he later returned to Africa, he convinced Congo Bill <b>that</b> <b>Africa's</b> destiny was industrialization. The two became business partners {{and built a}} successful conglomerate. Bill eventually came to see this life as a betrayal of his former life. So he rejected Janu's new philosophy, packed in the corporate life, and returned to adventuring as Congorilla.|$|R

It was only a small gesture, but it was something they could do." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Council {{condemned}} South Africa's continued {{occupation of}} the land and its illegal application of South African discriminatory laws in Namibia and demanded <b>that</b> South <b>Africa</b> make some declaration that it would comply with international law.

500|$|Another {{important}} African American {{leader of}} the 1920s was Marcus Garvey, promoter of the Back-to-Africa movement {{and founder of the}} Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). Garvey denounced Du Bois's efforts to achieve equality through integration, and instead endorsed racial separatism. Du Bois initially supported the concept of Garvey's Black Star Line, a shipping company that was intended to facilitate commerce within the African diaspora. But Du Bois later became concerned that Garvey was threatening the NAACP's efforts, leading Du Bois to describe him as fraudulent and reckless. Responding to Garvey's slogan [...] "Africa for the Africans", Du Bois said that he supported that concept, but denounced Garvey's intention <b>that</b> <b>Africa</b> be ruled by African Americans.|$|E
500|$|Writing for 'The Philosophy of Computer Games Conference in 2015, Harrer and Pichlmair {{considered}} Resident Evil 5 to be [...] "yet {{another moment}} in the history of commodity racism, which from the late 19th century onwards allowed popular depictions of racial stereotypes to enter the most intimate spaces of European homes." [...] The authors state <b>that</b> <b>Africa</b> is presented from a Western gaze; [...] "what it presented as 'authentic' blackness conforms to the projected fantasy of predominantly white gaming audience". In 2016, Paul Martin from Games and Culture said that the theme of the game could be described as [...] "dark continent", stating that it drew on imagery of European colonialism and depictions of [...] "Blackness" [...] reminiscent of 19th-century European theories on race.|$|E
500|$|Pliny's work {{frequently}} reflects Rome's imperial expansion {{which brought}} {{new and exciting}} things to the capital: exotic eastern spices, strange animals {{to be put on}} display or herded into the arena, even the alleged phoenix sent to the emperor Claudius in AD 47 – although, as Pliny admits, this was generally acknowledged to be a fake. Pliny repeated Aristotle's maxim <b>that</b> <b>Africa</b> was always producing something new. Nature's variety and versatility were claimed to be infinite: [...] "When I have observed nature she has always induced me to deem no statement about her incredible." [...] This led Pliny to recount rumours of strange peoples on the edges of the world. These monstrous races – the Cynocephali or Dog-Heads, the Sciapodae, whose single foot could act as a sunshade, the mouthless Astomi, who lived on scents – were not strictly new. They had been mentioned by the Greek historian Herodotus in the 5th century BC, but Pliny made them better known.|$|E
