40|$|Research on Finnish <b>television</b> {{history has}} so far {{emphasized}} Western influences. However, the Finnish <b>television</b> environment was also in many ways shaped by contacts with socialist <b>television</b> cultures. This article analyses the first volume (1960) of the <b>television</b> magazine Katso to trace the various transnational relations which shaped the early Finnish <b>television</b> environment and to discuss the cultural meanings of socialist <b>television</b> in this environment. Nearly every issue of Katso in 1960 discusses <b>television</b> in a transnational context. Transnational themes fall into four categories: (1) learning about <b>television</b> in other countries; (2) the Eurovision and Nordvision networks; (3) watching <b>television</b> across national borders (Swedish and Tallinn <b>television</b> but also <b>television</b> across surprising distances); and (4) visions of world <b>television.</b> Katso ’s understanding of <b>television</b> emphasises the literal meaning of <b>television,</b> to see far. The magazine sets no clear limits to what <b>television</b> could {{do in terms of}} overcoming physical distance and ideological borders. The magazine avoids overt politics in discussing <b>television</b> from both the West and the East and represents Tallinn <b>television</b> as a potential source of popular <b>television</b> for Finnish audiences. </p...|$|R
