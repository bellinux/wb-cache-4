5|$|A {{sport for}} two players or more, in the {{traditional}} version of poohsticks the participants must drop a stick simultaneously on the upstream side of a bridge and run to the other side. The winner is the player whose stick first appears {{on the other side}} of the bridge. Alternatively, players may decide upon a starting point on a river and a finish line farther downstream. The winner is the player whose stick first passes <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> point.|$|E
50|$|Two {{potential}} {{forms of}} cheating near <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> were dealt with using fencing at Marion Square at King Street (<b>the</b> <b>finish</b> festival site), and sponsor Bi-Lo parking a tractor-trailer {{at the intersection}} of Meeting and John to force runners to make the turn back to King. Furthermore, the live bands which play at <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> festival will be heard twice, as runners pass through Marion Square the first time on King Street, and after crossing <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line and cooling down.|$|R
2500|$|Rounding this mark {{puts them}} on a reach sprint to <b>the</b> <b>finish.</b> <b>The</b> fifth leg is around [...] in length. <b>The</b> <b>finish</b> line is {{right in front of}} America's Cup Park, at Piers 27/29.|$|R

5|$|Again, the day's {{principal}} breakaway {{was given}} a large time gap. After , Andrey Amador, Davide Malacarne, Mathew Hayman, Fabian Wegmann and Jens Mouris had a lead of over 11 minutes. The parcours began to take its toll at this point, and as the chase ramped up in the peloton, the time gap fell precipitously. By the time the ascent of the Sasso Tetto began, Mouris was gapped off and lost {{more and more time}} as the day went on, eventually finishing 21 minutes behind the stage winner. Hayman and Wegmann kept the pace for a while, and Wegmann won the day's second climb, the Camerino at , but eventually only Amador and Malacarne were left out front. The second group on the road eventually reduced itself to just a select group of overall favorites and contenders. Amador attacked first on <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> circuit, but Malacarne made the bridge. Instead of working together to stay away and let a two-up sprint decide the stage winner, Amador and Malacarne sat on one another's wheels and let their rapidly falling advantage dwindle even further. From the elite group of contenders, Pinotti put in an attack on an uphill section of <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> circuit that effectively gapped off race leader Robert Gesink, who had used up all of his support riders at this point. Gesink finished 17 seconds back on the day, losing the race leadership.|$|E
5|$|At Production I.G, Hiroyuki Kitakubo {{directed}} the animation scenes, wrote the screenplay {{and did the}} storyboards; Toshihiro Kawamoto was animation supervisor and a character designer. The scenes are noticeably different {{when compared to the}} film namesake directed by Mamoru Oshii, because the game is colored using a full digital technique. The scenes are a combination of cel animation and backgrounds that were rendered in three dimensions to ensure smooth transitions for the camera movement. Adobe Photoshop was used to add <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> details to the scenes.|$|E

500|$|The {{route of}} the 2016 Tour of the Basque Country was {{generally}} mountainous, with no stages suited for the sprinters.

5|$|Continuing in the {{tradition}} of previous editions, the championships comprised separate half marathon road races for men and women, with each race having an individual and international team aspect. Each nation could enter a maximum of five athletes per race and the team scores were calculated by combining <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> times of each team's top three runners. Nations with less than three runners were disregarded for the team event and their runners competed for the individual prizes only.|$|E
5|$|In {{the leading}} group, Pate {{made the first}} attack on the {{unclassified}} climb on <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> circuit, but Brändle covered the move and passed him. Brändle was then able to hold off the chase of Keisse– the faster sprinter– and finished the stage with a four-second advantage. Van Meirhaeghe finished third with Pate fourth. In the peloton, Peter Sagan won the bunch sprint, over a minute behind Brändle.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} and so far only time that the steeplechase was {{declared}} void, after 30 of the 39 runners began and carried on racing despite there having been a false start. Seven of the field even went on to complete the course, with Esha Ness crossing <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> post first, in what would have been the second-fastest time ever.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> ninth stage <b>finished</b> in Monaco, {{where the}} riders would ride one extra lap, {{crossing}} <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line twice.

5|$|The Paris–Roubaix Cyclo is {{organised}} by the Velo Club de Roubaix {{every other}} June. This allows amateurs {{to experience the}} cobbles, <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> laps in the vélodrome, and the showers.

5|$|The pier's {{secondary}} role {{was as a}} public pier, where pleasure craft were allowed to dock. Tour boats offering {{a view of the}} Kowloon side of the harbour used the pier for passenger boarding. Up to 1978, it was <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> line for the annual cross-harbour swimming race. As the ceremonies declined, the pier's secondary purpose became the main one: people met and strolled in the area, and others fished.|$|E
