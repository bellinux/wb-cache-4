5|$|Bhairava {{then takes}} Mithra, his soldiers, and his caretakers to the Bhairavakona temple atop a cliff to seek blessings from God. Mithra demands Bhairava admit {{his love for}} her. When he does not respond, she upsets the sacred items <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> for the puja and, using her own blood, paints an image on a nearby rock of Bhairava leaving his true love to do his duty. An injured soldier arrives to tell Bhairava that Ranadev and Sher Khan's army have killed Vikram Singh and are now rushing toward them. They arrive shortly, and Sher Khan {{challenges}} Bhairava to battle his soldiers. Bhairava boldly accepts the challenge and kills a hundred soldiers, but is severely injured in the process. Sher Khan, impressed by Bhairava's bravery, has a change of heart. However, Ranadev continues attacking, eventually wounding Mithra fatally, but he is in turn killed by Bhairava. A dying Mithra asks Bhairava to confess his love, but before he can respond, she dies and falls off the cliff. Distraught, he follows her and falls to his own death.|$|E

Hamlet feigns madness but subtly insults Polonius all the while. When Rosencrantz and Guildenstern arrive, Hamlet greets his [...] "friends" [...] warmly, but quickly discerns that they are spies. Hamlet becomes bitter, admitting that he is upset at his situation but refusing to give the true reason why, instead commenting on [...] "what a piece of work" [...] humanity is. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern tell Hamlet that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> along a troupe of actors that they met while traveling to Elsinore. Hamlet, after welcoming the actors and dismissing his friends-turned-spies, plots to stage a play featuring {{a death in the}} style of his father's murder, thereby determining the truth of the ghost's story, as well as Claudius's guilt or innocence, by studying Claudius's reaction.|$|E
500|$|According to Jović, on 27 June 1990 he and Veljko Kadijević, the Yugoslav Defence Minister, met {{and agreed}} that they should, {{regarding}} Croatia and Slovenia, [...] "expel them forcibly from Yugoslavia, by simply drawing borders and declaring that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> this upon themselves through their decisions". According to Jović, {{the next day he}} obtained the agreement of Milošević. However, Kadijević, of mixed Serb-Croat heritage and a Yugoslav Partisan in World War II, was loyal to Yugoslavia and not a Greater Serbia; Kadijević believed that if Slovenia left Yugoslavia the state would collapse and thus he discussed with Jović about possibly using the JNA to impose martial law in Slovenia to prevent this potential collapse and was willing to wage war with the secessionist republics to prevent their secession. Kadijević considered the political crisis and ethnic conflict to have been caused by the actions of foreign governments, particularly Germany, which he accused of seeking to break up Yugoslavia to allow Germany to exercise a sphere of influence in the Balkans. Kadijević regarded the Croatian government of Tuđman to be a fascist-inspired and that Serbs had the right to be protected from Croatian [...] "armed formations".|$|E

Morath wrote extensively, and often amusingly, about her photographic subjects.

Giving it a 4 out of 5-mic rating, The Sources Matty C compared the duo's lyrical style to that of Busta Rhymes, Treach, and EPMD, writing [...] "Not only have they innovated a new rhyme flow that expands on all these styles, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> back fun filled hip-hop". Ronin Ro of Spin complimented their [...] "hard lyrics that simultaneously perplex, captivate, annoy, and amuse... television-induced, schizophrenic, lyrical wit".

The Pandavas return home and inform their mother that Arjuna has won a competition and to look at what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> back.

2500|$|Egyptologist and {{linguist}} Daniel Jackson, Ph.D. {{is invited}} by Catherine Langford to translate Egyptian hieroglyphs on cover stones {{that her father}} had unearthed in Giza, Egypt in 1928.

Jackson determines that the hieroglyphs refer to a [...] "stargate" [...] which uses constellations as spatial coordinates. On this revelation, Jackson is shown that the base has this Stargate, also discovered by Langford's father. They use Jackson's coordinates to align the Stargate's metal ring with markings along its outside, and once all seven are locked in, a wormhole opens, connecting the Stargate with a distant planet. Jackson joins O'Neil and other soldiers as they pass through the wormhole, but expresses concern at a nuclear weapon <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> along as a last resort.|$|E
2500|$|More recently, {{scholars}} {{have questioned the}} perception of Thucydides as simply [...] "the father of realpolitik". Instead <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> to the fore the literary qualities of the History, which they see as belonging to the narrative tradition of Homer and Hesiod and as concerned with the concepts of justice and suffering found in Plato and Aristotle and problematized in Aeschylus and Sophocles. Richard Ned Lebow terms Thucydides [...] "the last of the tragedians", stating that [...] "Thucydides drew heavily on epic poetry and tragedy to construct his history, which not surprisingly is also constructed as a narrative." [...] In this view, the blind and immoderate behaviour of the Athenians (and indeed {{of all the other}} actors) – though perhaps intrinsic to human nature – ultimately leads to their downfall. Thus his History could serve as a warning to future leaders to be more prudent, by putting them on notice that someone would be scrutinizing their actions with a historian's objectivity rather than a chronicler's flattery.|$|E

Upon hearing of Russia's partial mobilization, Wilhelm wrote: [...] "Then I must mobilize too." [...] The German Ambassador in St. Petersburg informed Nicholas that Germany would mobilize if Russia did not cease all military preparations at once, including those it had previously assured Russia it did not see as a threat against Germany or cause for German mobilization. The German military attaché in Russia reported that: [...] "I have the impression that they the Russians have mobilized here from a dread of coming events without aggressive intentions and are now frightened at what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> about." [...] At the same time, Nicholas’ order for a partial mobilization met with protests from both Sazonov and the Russian War Minister General Vladimir Sukhomlinov, who insisted partial mobilization was not technically possible, and that, given Germany's attitude, a general mobilization was required. Nicholas at first ordered a general mobilization, and then after receiving an appeal for peace from Wilhelm cancelled it as a sign of his good faith. The cancellation of general mobilization led to furious protests from Sukhomlinov, Sazonov, and Russia's top generals, all urging Nicholas to reinstate it. Under strong pressure, Nicholas gave in and ordered a general mobilization on 30 July.|$|E
