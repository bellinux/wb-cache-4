The effects on the longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of vortex-generator wing semispan location, distance from wing leading edge, leading-edge sweep angle, <b>toe-in</b> <b>angle,</b> and span are presented. The effects of the vortex generators on the lateral-directional aerodynamic characteristics of the model for a sideslip angle of 5 deg are included...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program was}} conducted in the Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel to evaluate the performance effects of various types of pylons on a 1 / 17 th-scale, low-wing transport model. The model wing was designed for cruise at a Mach number of 0. 77 and a lift coefficient of 0. 55. The pylons were tested at two wing semispan locations over a range of toe-in angles. The effects of <b>toe-in</b> <b>angle</b> {{were found to be}} minimal, but the variation in geometry had a more pronounced effect on the lift characteristics of the model. A pylon whose maximum thickness occurred at the wing trailing edge, known as a compression pylon, proved to be the best choice in terms of retaining the flow characteristics of the wing without pylons. Practical considerations such as structural viability may necessitate modification of the compression pylon concept in order to take advantage of its apparent benefits...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a necessity {{to take into}} account <b>toe-in</b> <b>angles</b> while making calculations of suspension kinematics. An algorithm for determination of vehicle wheel center coordinates with due account of camber and <b>toe-in</b> <b>angles</b> is presented with the help of turn matrices.   The obtained formulas describing functional dependence of vehicle wheel centre coordinates on camber and <b>toe-in</b> <b>angles</b> allow to reduce a general error in calculations and mathematical models for  operation of running gear and steering mechanisms...|$|R

The current work contains the load cases and boundary conditions for stresses and strains analysis of chassis using finite element analysis. King pin inclination, camber, caster, and <b>toe-in</b> <b>angles</b> of a truck's wheels affect its chassis' longitudinal and transverse stresses and strains. This work concentrates on studying the chassis' stresses and strains when the truck is in longitudinal acceleration motion on asphalted straight road and has adjustable wheel angels for the steerable axles' wheels...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this paper aims to simulate the road holding of a virtual vehicle using multibody simulation to estimate the contact forces between tire and ground and the roll motion when cornering. Furthermore, {{the effect of the}} characteristic angles on the variation of the forces of the tire in contact with the ground is studied to determine optimal values for these angles. Emphasis is placed on an average-class vehicle, of which both the external dimensions and mass are chosen appropriately, with a McPherson suspension mounted on both the front and rear. The characteristic values of the camber and <b>toe-in</b> <b>angles,</b> in both the front and the rear, are optimized for motion in the curve under constant traction. The results of numerical simulation are compared with results from the theory of stability in the curve (given the vertical configuration of the vehicle) ...|$|R
40|$|It {{was found}} that for {{identical}} increases in bending moment, a winglet provides a greater gain in induced efficiency than a tip extension. Winglet <b>toe-in</b> <b>angle</b> allows design trades between efficiency and root moment. A winglet showed the greatest benefit when the wing loads were heavy near the tip. Washout diminished the benefit of either tip modification, and the gain in induced efficiency became a function of lift coefficient; heavy wing loadings obtained the greatest benefit from a winglet, and low speed performance was enhanced even more than cruise performance. Both induced efficiency and bending moment increased with winglet length and outward cant. The benefit of a winglet relative to a tip extension was greatest for a nearly vertical winglet. Root bending moment was proportional to the minimum weight of bending material required in the wing; it is a valid index {{of the impact of}} tip modifications on a new wing design...|$|E
40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to examine the use of wing leading-edge devices for improved subsonic and transonic maneuver performance. These devices were tested on a fighter configuration which utilized supercritical-wing technology. The configuration had a leading-edge sweep of 45 deg and an aspect ratio of 3. 28. The {{tests were conducted}} at Mach numbers of 0. 60 and 0. 85 with angles of attack from - 0. 5 deg to 22 deg. At both Mach numbers, sharp leading-edge flaps produced vortices which greatly altered the flow pattern on the wing and resulted in substantial reductions in drag at high lift. Underwing or pylon-type vortex generators also reduced drag at high lift. The vortex generators worked better at a Mach number of 0. 60. The vortex generators gave the best overall results with zero <b>toe-in</b> <b>angle</b> and when mounted on either the outboard part of the wing or at both an outboard location and halfway out the semispan. Both the flaps and the vortex generators had a minor effect on the pitching moment. Fluorescent minitufts {{were found to be}} useful for flow visualization at transonic maneuver conditions...|$|E
40|$|Considering the {{underlying}} reason of tire polygonal wear, a unified mechanical tire model is developed {{to analyze the}} different vibration properties between the driving wheel and follower wheel. And the LuGre dynamic friction model is applied to determine the frictional forces between the wheel with a slip angel and the road. Through the stability analysis with Lyapunov theory, {{it is found that}} tread self-excited vibration is periodic oscillation caused by Hopf bifurcation. The analysis of the lateral vibration of driving wheel shows that the tread vibration system loses its stability and self-excited vibration occurs when the wheel is rolling at a high speed, is over-loaded, is having a large <b>toe-in</b> <b>angle,</b> or is under a low tire pressure. On this basis, the dynamic behaviors of the driving and follower wheels are distinguished with different slip rates by the numerical simulation. Compared with the dynamic behaviors of the follower wheel under the same condition, the self-excited vibration occurs on the driving wheel with more limited parameter scope, lower oscillation energy, and lower occurrence, which explains why the polygonal wear is less likely to occur on the driving wheel...|$|E
40|$|Pylon {{cross-sectional}} geometries {{that are}} intended to improve the aerodynamics of the propulsion system installation were investigated on a 1 / 17 th-scale, low-wing transport model in the Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel. The basic design philosophy for these pylons was to alleviate ow acceleration without introducing severe adverse pressure gradients near the pylon-wing junction. This result was achieved {{by means of a}} gradually diverging pylon with the maximum thickness occurring at the wing trailing edge. The pylon closure occurred aft of the wing trailing edge. Other pylon cross-sectional geometries were also tried, but only the pylon design described above and its hybrid derivative achieved the desired result. The force data, surface static pressure measurements, and surface ow visualization data that were obtained support this result. Data were taken at Mach numbers from 0. 50 to 0. 80, model angles of attack from 04 to 6, and pylon <b>toe-in</b> <b>angles</b> from 0 to 3...|$|R
40|$|A newly {{designed}} liquid fuel (kerosene) aeroramp injector/plasma igniter was tested in cold flow using the Virginia Tech supersonic wind tunnel at Mach 2. 4. The liquid fuel (kerosene) injector is flush wall mounted {{and consists of}} a 2 hole aeroramp array of impinging jets that are oriented in a manner to improve mixing and atomization of the liquid jets. The two jets are angled downstream at 40 degrees and have a <b>toe-in</b> <b>angle</b> of 60 degrees. The plasma torch used nitrogen and air as feedstocks and was placed downstream of the injector as an ignition aid. First, schlieren and shadowgraph photographs were taken of the injector flow to study {{the behavior of the}} jets, shape of the plume, and penetration of the liquid jet. The liquid fuel aeroramp was found to have better penetration than a single, round jet at 40 degrees. However, the liquid fuel aeroramp does not penetrate as well as an upstream/downstream impinging jet in a plane aligned with the flow. Next, the Sauter mean droplet diameter distribution was measured downstream of the injector. The droplet diameter was found to vary from 21 to 37 microns and the atomization of the injector does not appear to improve beyond 90 effective jet diameters from the liquid fuel aeroramp. These results were then used t...|$|E
40|$|Stern gear {{design for}} luxury high speed yachts {{currently}} relies on an {{estimation of the}} inflow velocity at the propeller plane and the propeller race. These components are often located within tunnel features on the hull and the flow regime will {{be influenced by the}} vessel trim and planning speed. Typically, the flow into the propeller is taken as an average over the entire propeller area and {{does not take into account}} the variation of the flow into the propeller due to appendages and hull shape. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations allow this variation to be calculated. These data are coupled with a potential based lifting surface program and are used to improve propeller design. In order to optimise the design of the rudder, the propeller race must be known. A method of introducing the propeller forces back into the CFD flow is investigated. This improved method has the advantage of providing a more accurate flow field into the rudder, which allows the rudder design to be improved. It is expected that this procedure will reduce the rudder drag and cavitation. The development and validation of this CFD methodology applied to high speed planning craft propulsion using open source software is illustrated with regard to two case studies for P bracket and propeller design optimisation, and to estimate the <b>toe-in</b> <b>angle</b> for the rudder in order to align it with the propeller race...|$|E

40|$|Propagation of the {{detonation}} wave in gas mixtures of methane with oxygen in a channel of variable cross section was studied experimentally. To conduct these investigations a special detonation combustion chamber comprising sections of various diameters has been designed. In {{the section of}} {{detonation wave}} formation a combustible mixture was ignited. After that, a flame front accelerated till the formation of detonation. At the exit from the combustion chamber there was an outlet conical section. In conducted experiments the <b>toe-in</b> <b>angle</b> was equal to 3 °. The combustion chamber was open-ended. So an initial pressure inside the combustion chamber prior to each experiment was equal to the atmospheric pressure. The initial temperature was ambient one of 300 K. As a diagnostics, piezoelectric sensors of pressure and photo diodes were used. Detonation initiation was accomplished by spark gap. For this pulse generator I- 1 was used. Spark energy did not exceed 0. 1 J and was {{much lower than the}} energy of the direct initiation of detonation. Deflagration-to-detonation transition was occurred. A composition of the mixtures was selected {{in such a way that}} the detonation cell width was several times smaller than the diameter of the channel. The mixture was composed by the partial pressures of methane, oxygen, and nitrogen and was kept in the 40 l tank within 24 hours under 5 - 8 atm. pressure. Возникновение де- тонации возникало вследствие перехода горения в детонацию. The aim of this study was to determine the parameters of a detonation wave in a channel of variable cross section in the methane-oxygen mixture. The influence of nitrogen impurities on the cell size and the speed and pressure of the detonation wave was investigated. The waves velocities and peak pressures at the front of the detonation wave were measured depending on composition, including the presence of nitrogen. The sizes of the detonation cells were measured using smoked foil mounted inside the channel. The effect of the interference of the shock waves in a conical section was studied. Diagrams of the shock waves, flame fronts, and detonation waves in the combustion chamber depending on the mixture composition are presented. The paper gives data on some compositions of mixtures. </p...|$|E
