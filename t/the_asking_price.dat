5|$|The panels were {{included}} in the Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings, which included another important van Eyck work, the 1434–1436 Annunciation. They were purchased by Charles Henschel of New York art dealer M. Knoedler & Company for $185,000, significantly less than <b>the</b> <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> of $600,000 when the works were offered in 1931. The panels were shipped from Saint Petersburg to the Matthiesen Gallery in Berlin before M. Knoedler & Company sold them on to the Metropolitan in New York that year.|$|E
5|$|A 1935 {{article in}} the Montreal Gazette, meanwhile, stated that the {{original}} September Morn had yet {{to go to the}} United States, and that Chabas had sold it directly to Mantashev. According to Chabas, this was after an American approached him to purchase the painting, but was unwilling to pay <b>the</b> <b>asking</b> <b>price.</b> In her memoirs, Vogue editor Edna Woolman Chase recounted how Ortiz had arranged for numerous reproductions to be made and sent to New York, and that– although he had been interested in acquiring the original– he had been unable to do so. Although {{it is possible that the}} original did not cross the Atlantic by 1913, it is clear that reproductions did.|$|E
5|$|By 1982, the Old Strathcona Foundation was {{confident}} {{enough in the}} theatre’s prospects to purchase the building outright from Towne Cinema. By this time, <b>the</b> <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> for the building had dropped to $425,000, which {{was estimated to be}} $8000 below its real market value. The Foundation began to make major upgrades and repairs to the interior of the building. A fundraising drive in 1987 allowed 422 modern sized plush seats to be installed, lowering the theatre’s original seating capacity by almost 240. In 1989, a soundproofed cry room was installed with an independent sound system, allowing patrons with small children to come to films without worry.|$|E
50|$|In bid and <b>ask,</b> <b>the</b> term <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> {{is used in}} {{contrast}} to the term bid price. The difference between the bid <b>price</b> and <b>the</b> <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> is called <b>the</b> spread.|$|R

30|$|Markets {{are also}} viewed as {{willing to sell}} random cash flows if the {{resulting}} price less the cash flow is market acceptable. Positivity of expectations under test probabilities renders <b>the</b> best <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> to be <b>the</b> supremum of expectations across test probabilities. <b>The</b> <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> is then a convex function on the space of random cash flows and, by construction, <b>the</b> <b>ask</b> exceeds <b>the</b> bid. It {{is also the case}} that <b>the</b> <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> is <b>the</b> negative of the bid for the negative cash flow.|$|R
5|$|In September 1998 Manchester United {{were the}} target of a {{proposed}} takeover by British Sky Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Negotiations between both sides had begun during the summer, but had stalled after disagreements over <b>the</b> <b>asking</b> <b>price.</b> The satellite group’s original bid of £575million – initially thought to be their final offer – was deemed too low by two members of United’s board (chairman Martin Edwards and Professor Sir Roland Smith), who pressed for a higher figure. Two days of talks followed and in an attempt to close the deal, BSkyB made a final bid of £623.4million.|$|E
5|$|On 17 May 2008, the BBC {{reported}} that the tenants had put the remaining 40 years of their lease up for sale, with an asking price of £15,000,000. Within four days, there were over 50 potential buyers, which led to fears from residents that the island's identity would be lost if it was bought by the wrong owner. In September 2008 {{it was announced that}} Starboard Settlement, a trust, had acquired the remainder of the lease for considerably less than <b>the</b> <b>asking</b> <b>price.</b> The trust formed a company based in Guernsey, Herm Island Ltd, to manage the island for the trustees.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Potts was poorly {{received}} by critics. Etty's admirers were angered by his apparent abandonment of history painting for the then poorly regarded field of portrait painting, while Etty's critics {{felt he had}} demonstrated {{that he did not}} have the technical skills to produce high quality portraits, and was simply trying to use his name to make money in the more lucrative field of portraiture. History paintings were generally sold at exhibition for no less than <b>the</b> <b>asking</b> <b>price,</b> and as a consequence often remained unsold. Portraits were commissioned by the subject or their family, providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist. History painting was much more highly regarded as an art form; portrait painting was seen as reflecting nature whereas history painting involved more creativity and also gave the artist the opportunity to tell moral lessons.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ask</b> <b>prices</b> are {{immediate}} execution (market) {{prices for}} quick buyers (ask takers) while bid prices are for quick sellers (bid takers).

30|$|Since {{constants}} {{come out}} of the infima of expectations, Madan (2016) shows that one may write the bid price as the expected value under a base probability less <b>the</b> <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> for <b>the</b> negative of the centered or demeaned cash flow. One may then also view the bid price as measuring reward by the expectation under the base probability less a risk measure given by <b>the</b> <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> for <b>the</b> negative of the centered cash flow. Since the centered negative cash flow has a zero mean by construction, and as the base probability is one of the test probabilities, <b>the</b> <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> is always positive and can be minimized subject to attaining a particular expectation. This naturally leads us to a mean <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> frontier and examples of such constructions may be found in Madan (2016). Here we consider <b>the</b> mean <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> frontier for <b>the</b> two-period portfolio problem.|$|R
5|$|Ownership of the {{continuous}} park blocks {{was not without}} dispute, however. After Lownsdale died without a will, and then his wife Nancy died, his estate challenged that his plat didn't require the central section to be dedicated to public use since Nancy had not signed over legal title to the land. The courts agreed in 1865. Benjamin Stark reneged on the donation of two north central park blocks to the city, instead offering to sell them for $138,000. Captain John H. Couch deeded his section, which became the North Park Blocks to the city on January 25, 1865, only ten days after receiving the federal patent for the land. Six of the South Park Blocks were lost to private parties in the 1870s, and elected city officials were unwilling to spend <b>the</b> <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> of $6,000 per block to purchase them so soon after the city had bought the land for Washington Park. Only a year later, a proposal to acquire the six blocks for $92,000 was brought by the city council, showing the increase in prices in that year.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze and {{interpret}} the quote price dynamics of 100 NYSE stocks stratified by trade frequency. We specify an error-correction model for the log difference of the bid and <b>the</b> <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> with <b>the</b> spread acting as the error-correction term, and include as regressors {{the characteristics of the}} trades occurring between quote observations, if any. From this model we are also able to extract the implied model for the spread and the mid-quote. We find that short duration and medium volume trades have the largest impacts on quote prices for all one hundred stocks. Further, we find that buys have a greater impact on <b>the</b> <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> than on <b>the</b> bid price, while sells have a greater impact on the bid <b>price</b> than on <b>the</b> <b>ask</b> <b>price.</b> Both buys and sells increase spreads in the short run, but in the absence of further trades, the spreads mean revert.

40|$|Financial {{instruments}} are {{bought and sold}} at a financial market. Market makers at a financial market act as intermediaries between the buyer and the seller of the financial instrument. Market makers {{have the power to}} quote the bid <b>price</b> and <b>the</b> <b>ask</b> <b>price.</b> This price-setting process is called market-making. With market maker models this price-setting proces of the market maker is studied. To create liquidity in the market the market maker must trade immediately if an order arrives. The market maker bears risk because he does not have optimal portfolios. To protect himself against the losses he quotes <b>the</b> <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> higher than <b>the</b> bid price. The difference between the bid <b>price</b> and <b>the</b> <b>ask</b> <b>price</b> is called <b>the</b> bid-ask spread. The main causes of emergence of bid-ask spread are the fixed costs, the inventory costs and the adverse selection costs. Fixed costs are costs arising from order execution.

25|$|According {{to recent}} scholarship, the {{painting}} was first owned by Francesco Pisani, and housed at the Palazzo Pisani in Montagnana, a building designed by Palladio. The canvas was probably moved to Venice after 1629, when the Pisani family purchased a palace on the Grand Canal. It was so esteemed that in 1664 agents of Christina, Queen of Sweden attempted to negotiate its purchase with the Venetian ambassador to Rome. <b>The</b> <b>asking</b> <b>price</b> of 5,000 ducats was considered excessive, and effectively discouraged all prospective buyers.
