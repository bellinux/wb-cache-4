5|$|Having become {{versed in}} Kuba {{language}} and culture, Sheppard took {{a team of}} men {{to the edge of}} Kuba territory in 1892. His original plan was to ask for directions to the next village under the guise of purchasing supplies, but the chief of the village only allowed one of his men to go. Sheppard used a variety of <b>tricks</b> <b>to</b> make his way further into the kingdom, including having a scout follow a group of traders and, most famously, eating so many eggs that the townspeople could no longer supply him and his scout was able {{to gain access to the}} next village to find more eggs. Eventually, however, he encountered villagers that would allow him to go no further. While Sheppard was formulating a plan, the king's son, Prince N'toinzide, arrived and arrested Sheppard and his men for trespassing.|$|E
5|$|Kalyani becomes pregnant. But {{on the day}} she {{delivers}} her child, Thangappan dies in {{an accident}} and Manickampillai dies of shock, leaving Kalyani and her child destitute. Her house gets auctioned off, and she makes her living by selling food on the streets. Gunasekaran, after being stranded at sea for several months, finally arrives in Tamil Nadu at Madras. However, while watching a dance performance, he is robbed of all his belongings after being intoxicated. Impoverished, he becomes enraged at the status of the once glorious Tamil Nadu, and fakes insanity by indulging in numerous <b>tricks</b> <b>to</b> make a living. Gunasekaran finally comes across his destitute sister at Madurai, having learned of their father's death and her poverty. He continues to play insane and does not reveal his true identity to her due to his poverty, but hovers around her. Kalyani is irritated by the stranger's behaviour, unaware that he is her brother.|$|E
5|$|The effects crew {{focused on}} using in-camera <b>tricks</b> <b>to</b> realize the probe; {{post-production}} effects were time-consuming, so lighting effects were done on stage while filming. Model shop supervisor Jeff Mann filled the probe's antenna with tube lamps and halogen bulbs that were turned on in sequence for different exposures; three different camera passes for each exposure were combined {{for the final}} effect. After watching the first shot, the team found the original, whalelike probe design lacking in menace. The modelmakers repainted the probe a shiny black, pockmarked its surface for greater texture and interest, and re-shot the scene. Although they wanted to avoid post-production effects work, the opticals team had to recolor the antenna ball in a blue hue, as the original orange looked too much like a spinning basketball.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} November 9, 1981, and ended on January 29, 1982. The Wrath of Khan was more action-oriented than its predecessor, but less costly to make. The project was supervised by Paramount's television unit {{rather than its}} theatrical division. Bennett, a respected television veteran, made The Wrath of Khan on a budget of $11million—far less than The Motion Pictures $46million. The budget was initially lower at $8.5 million, but it rose when the producers were impressed by {{the first two weeks}} of footage. Meyer used camera and set <b>tricks</b> <b>to</b> spare the construction of large and expensive sets. For a scene taking place at Starfleet Academy, a forced perspective was created by placing scenery close to the camera to give the sense the set was larger than it really was. To present the illusion that the Enterprises elevators moved between decks, corridor pieces were wheeled out of sight to change the hall configuration while the lift doors were closed. Background equipment such as computer terminals were rented when possible instead of purchased outright. Some designed props, such as a redesigned phaser and communicator, were vetoed by Paramount executives in favor of existing materials from The Motion Picture.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the first}} heroic horses {{emerged from the}} silent film era, they were {{prominently}} featured in the B-Westerns of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. During {{the early decades of}} sound film, cowboy movies targeted a juvenile demographic. The film's heroes were generally one-dimensional, stock characters who represented and promoted truth and goodness to their young audience. More popular with adolescent viewers than a human sidekick, the Wonder Horse could not only outrun the mounts of the villains, but could also perform a series of feats and <b>tricks</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the cowboy hero would triumph.|$|E
25|$|Manuel II was {{now out of}} <b>tricks</b> <b>to</b> {{save the}} {{erroneous}} rule of his son, John VIII. In September 1423, Thessalonika was surrendered to the Venetians, no doubt hoping to draw in the Western Powers into crusading mode and, if not, at least their wealth {{would enable them to}} defend it better. In February 1424, Manuel II Palaiologos re-established Byzantium as a vassal of the Ottomans — 300,000 silver coins were to be paid to the Sultan on annual basis. That the Empire managed to accomplish this at its lowest ebb is remarkable. Nonetheless until the 1450s, the Ottomans would not make any concerted efforts to overcome the walls of Constantinople, and the city retained a tenuous security for the next two decades.|$|E
25|$|James Cook (Jack O'Connell), Freddie McClair (Luke Pasqualino) and JJ Jones (Ollie Barbieri) {{have been}} best friends since childhood. Though Cook is charismatic and sociable, {{he is also}} boisterous and not afraid of authority. His womanising drives many of {{the events in the}} series. By contrast, Freddie is an easy-going skater who likes to smoke weed, and as the more {{sensible}} and responsible friend, is often put out by Cook's behaviour. Cook and Freddie are both drawn to Effy, which drives a rift in their friendship. JJ's autism makes it difficult for him to fit in socially, but he has learnt to use magic <b>tricks</b> <b>to</b> make friends. His friends view him kindly but with a degree of amusement and sometimes irritation, but he knows Cook and Freddie will always take care of him. He is the kindest of the three, and by far the least worldly.|$|E

25|$|A {{partnership}} reneges {{on their}} contract if they violate {{the rules of}} play; most often this happens when a player plays off-suit when they could have, and therefore should have, followed suit. The penalty for reneging varies; in most cases it nullifies that team's contract (the team cannot make their contract and their score is reduced by 10 points for each bid trick), while sometimes reneging results in a three-trick penalty, meaning the team may still make contract but must take three additional <b>tricks</b> <b>to</b> do so. It does not matter if the player reneges on purpose. The bags still count against the opposing team, and will go against their points. On the other-hand if a team calls reneg and that team cannot prove or call out the first hand that was a potential reneg, then the team that called out the false accusation is penalized the three-trick penalty. The tricks do not count towards opponents bid.|$|E
25|$|Sonic 3D Blast was {{the final}} Sonic game to be {{released}} for the Sega Genesis. Sega had discontinued official support for the Genesis in 1995, but intended all along to produce the game for the 16-bit console because games typically sell for {{one to two years}} after their platforms' discontinuation. Early on, a test build was made to help decide if a split-screen two-player mode would be viable, but split-screen would not end up in the final product. Jon Burton, programmer for the Genesis version, implemented an exception handler where, should an error occur, the game would greet the player with a secret level select screen instead of crashing; this was done so the game could easily pass Sega's approval process for publishing games. Burton also gave this version a unique full motion video intro sequence that could only fit on the 4MB cartridge by using compression and various <b>tricks</b> <b>to</b> make the low-resolution video appear higher resolution.|$|E
25|$|Sakuraba {{became known}} for a unique, unorthodox {{fighting}} style which can be most described as creative. He used in the ring moves and techniques from professional wrestling, among them spinning sole kicks, jumping stomps, Mongolian chops and baseball slides. He also used cartwheels to pass guard and several kinds of confusing, often comical <b>tricks</b> <b>to</b> gain advantage over his opponent. However, his main strength was his rounded set of abilities come from shoot-style wrestling, which included a grinding striking learned from muay thai and a brilliant catch wrestling submission expertise. He submitted important grapplers of his time like Royler Gracie, Renzo Gracie and Masakatsu Funaki by using his signature double top wrist lock, a technique he opened both from standing and on the ground. Though he didn't fear giving his back to his opponent {{in order to secure}} it, Sakuraba would also use the technique as a positional weapon, threatening with them to control his adversary. Renzo Gracie praised his ability to play against his opponent's weaknesses, and Mark Kerr called him the world's best technician at his time.|$|E

40|$|Inference {{in popular}} nonparametric Bayesian models {{typically}} relies on sampling or other approximations. This paper presents a general methodology for constructing novel tractable nonparametric Bayesian methods {{by applying the}} kernel <b>trick</b> <b>to</b> inference in a parametric Bayesian model. For example, Gaussian process regression can be derived this way from Bayesian linear regression. Despite {{the success of the}} Gaussian process framework, the kernel trick is rarely explicitly considered in the Bayesian literature. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap and demonstrate the potential of applying the kernel <b>trick</b> <b>to</b> tractable Bayesian parametric models in a wider context than just regression. As an example, we present an intuitive Bayesian kernel machine for density estimation that is obtained by applying the kernel <b>trick</b> <b>to</b> a Gaussian generative model in feature space. ...|$|R

25|$|Free kicks and dead-ball restarts {{come into}} play {{following}} a foul or other infractions. Indirect free kicks must be touched by another player before any shot is taken. Direct free kicks can be made directly on goal. Offensive players attempt numerous <b>tricks</b> <b>to</b> beat the defenders, who often form a solid wall of players {{directly in front of}} the goal. Attackers may attempt to blast the ball through the defensive wall, or curl it over or around using spin. A less common idea is to hit the ball powerfully and straight along the floor, since the defenders in the wall usually jump to try and prevent a shot being lifted over their heads.
