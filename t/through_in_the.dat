5|$|Certain {{elements}} of the character are drawn from the real Colbert's personal life. Both the real Colbert and the character were raised in Charleston, South Carolina; both are the youngest of 11 children; both played Dungeons & Dragons as teenagers; and both are practicing Roman Catholics. Colbert's own interest in and knowledge of religion, science fiction, and J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings story will often show <b>through</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Report.

He also owns a Sting sword presented to him by Peter Jackson.|$|E
5|$|Kartik had {{opportunities}} in the ODI format following his strong form in domestic limited overs matches, playing in four consecutive matches against the West Indies. After going wicketless {{in the first of}} these matches, he broke <b>through</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next match to take his maiden ODI wicket in his third appearance. Kartik then took 3/36 in the next match as India scraped home by three wickets, but he was punished in his fourth outing of the series, conceding 69 runs in nine overs without success, after which he was dropped. He had taken four wickets at 47.25, at an economy rate of 4.84.|$|E
5|$|Storm {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{as far north}} as the Russian Far East as officials anticipated the remnants of the typhoon to cause significant disruption in the region. Residents were advised to avoid outdoor activities from August28 to 29 as the storm moved <b>through.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Sea of Japan, more than 100 ships sought refuge in bays across the Primorsky Krai. Ferry service to all islands in the region was also suspended. All military personnel in the region were placed at an elevated state of readiness for the storm. On August28, crisis centers were opened in 12 cities and 22 districts across Primorsky Krai. Although the storm was expected to cause significant disruptions in the region, Russian Emergencies Minister Vladimir Puchkov stated that the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Vladivostok would continue as planned.|$|E

5|$|The Law Society of England and Wales persuaded Coopers & Lybrand {{to include}} an {{alternate}} reform proposal in their report, and after pressure from the Law Society, {{and several of the}} larger regional societies, the alternate proposal was used. This was far weaker than the original proposal, and kept the responsibility of regulating the solicitors' profession within the Law Society but increased the separation of functions within the Society and required {{that the majority of the}} people on regulatory committees be lay people (not solicitors). The events surrounding this scandal have been directly linked to the reforms pushed <b>through</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, which created an independent disciplinary body for solicitors.|$|E
5|$|The N.W.O.B.H.M. Encyclopedia by Malc Macmillan lists {{more than}} 500 {{recording}} bands {{established in the}} decade between 1975 and 1985 and related to the movement. Probably as many bands launched in the same period, but never emerged from their local club scene, or recorded nothing more than demo tapes or limited pressings of self-produced singles. The disinterest of record labels, poor management of bands, internal struggles and musical choices that turned off much of their original fan base, resulted in most groups disbanding and disappearing {{by the end of}} the decade. A few of the best known groups, such as Praying Mantis in Japan and Saxon, Demon and Tokyo Blade in mainland Europe, survived in foreign markets. Some others, namely Raven, Girlschool and Grim Reaper, tried to break <b>through</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US market signing with American labels, but their attempts were unsuccessful. Two of the more popular bands of the movement, however, went on to considerable, lasting success. Iron Maiden has since become one of the most commercially successful and influential heavy metal bands of all time, even after adopting a more progressive style. Def Leppard became even more successful, targeting the American mainstream rock market with their more refined hard rock sound.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, England {{participated in}} both the Women's Cricket World Cup, and the inaugural Women's World Twenty20. Taylor was {{identified}} as one of England's key players in {{a preview of the}} tournament, and she set up victory for England in their opening match against Sri Lanka with her eighth ODI century, her third in successive World Cup matches against Sri Lanka. She asserted her dominance once more in the second match, against India, scoring quicker than a run a ball for her 69 not out, to help England chase down a modest total in under 40 overs. Not required to bat against Pakistan, and dismissed for 19 against New Zealand, Taylor helped secure England's place in the final with a rapid 65 runs, including 2 sixes and 6 fours, against the West Indies. In England's final match of the group stages, Taylor top-scored with 49 runs in a dead rubber loss against Australia: Australia could not qualify for the final, and England were already <b>through.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> final, having restricted New Zealand to 166, England were ahead of the required rate early. An early loss of wicket brought Taylor to the crease, and she played an attacking innings of 21, including 4 fours, before being bowled. England won the match by four wickets, to become ODI world champions. Taylor finished the tournament as the leading run-scorer, having made 324 runs, and her batting average was the highest amongst batsmen with over 100 runs. She was one of five England players to be named in the team of the tournament.|$|E

5|$|The Squadron {{did not see}} {{action in}} the Battle of France {{on the first day}} of the campaign—10 May—but many other Battle squadrons did and {{suffered}} high losses attacking German ground forces. The squadron's airfield came under air attack from the first day. Junkers Ju 88s destroyed hangars and two aircraft in a night attack. On 11 May it was bombed again and three of four aircraft were lost attacking German Army columns in daylight hours. On 14 May McLachlan flew his first sortie over the Sedan bridgeheads. The German thrust at Sedan threatened to outflank the Maginot Line in the south and the Allied Armies in the north by breaking <b>through</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre and advancing to the English Channel. On 12 May Sedan fell. Heinz Guderian's XIX Panzer Corps and Georg-Hans Reinhardt's XXXXI Panzer Corps were breaking through onto the west bank on the 14 May. Desperate to halt the attacks, General Marcel Têtu, commander of the Allied Tactical Air Forces in consultation with Air Vice-Marshal Playfair, commander of the AASF, ordered all available units to attack. No. 88 Squadron was committed to the air offensive. Six aircraft attacked armoured column positions, four attacked bridges. One aircraft was lost. Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire and German fighter opposition MacLachlan attacked and got away at low altitude. Allied units suffered 50 percent losses that day. On 15 May the airfield was hit twice again and the squadron moved back near Troyes.|$|E
