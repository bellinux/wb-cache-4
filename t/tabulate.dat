5|$|The scleractinian corals {{filled the}} niche vacated by the extinct rugose and <b>tabulate</b> species. Their fossils {{may be found}} in small numbers in rocks from the Triassic period, and became common in the Jurassic and later periods. Scleractinian skeletons are {{composed}} of a form of calcium carbonate known as aragonite. Although they are geologically younger than the <b>tabulate</b> and rugose corals, the aragonite of their skeletons is less readily preserved, and their fossil record is accordingly less complete.|$|E

The Squaw Valley Olympics was the first winter Olympics to have a dedicated athletes' village, {{the first to use}} a computer (courtesy of IBM) to <b>tabulate</b> results, and the first to feature female speed skating events.

25|$|A {{difference}} {{engine is}} an automatic mechanical calculator designed to <b>tabulate</b> polynomial functions.

Most mathematical functions commonly used by engineers, scientists and navigators, including logarithmic and trigonometric functions, can be approximated by polynomials, so a difference engine can compute many useful tables of numbers.|$|E

25|$|A now dry barrier reef, {{located in}} present-day Kimberley Basin of {{northwest}} Australia, once extended a thousand kilometers, fringing a Devonian continent. Reefs {{in general are}} built by various carbonate-secreting organisms that {{have the ability to}} erect wave-resistant frameworks close to sea level. The main contributors of the Devonian reefs were unlike modern reefs, which are constructed mainly by corals and calcareous algae. They were composed of calcareous algae and coral-like stromatoporoids, and <b>tabulate</b> and rugose corals, in that order of importance.|$|E
25|$|The most {{vulnerable}} marine organisms were those that produced calcareous hard parts (i.e., from calcium carbonate) and had low metabolic rates and weak respiratory systems—notably calcareous sponges, rugose and <b>tabulate</b> corals, calcite-depositing brachiopods, bryozoans, and echinoderms; about 81% of such genera became extinct. Close relatives without calcareous hard parts suffered only minor losses, for example sea anemones, from which modern corals evolved. Animals with high metabolic rates, well-developed respiratory systems, and non-calcareous hard parts had negligible losses—except for conodonts, in which 33% of genera died out.|$|E

40|$|Historians {{studying}} predecessors of {{the computer}} often provide brief discussions of Hollerith's <b>tabulating</b> equipment, especially {{in the context of}} his Census work [e. g., 9]. A decade ago Geoffrey D. Austrian's Herman Hollerith: Forgotten Giant of Information Processing [1] drew attention to the technology and its inventor, providing many details of its early evolution in response to government and then business needs. Recently this technology has received more attention [19, 3, 5]. These treatments have begun to explore the role of <b>tabulating</b> equipment in American business before World War II, as well as the role of the business market {{in the development of the}} <b>tabulating</b> equipment industry.

25|$|The {{first person}} to {{recognize}} fossil dinoflagellates was Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, who reported his discovery in a paper presented to the Berlin Academy of Sciences in July 1836. He had observed clearly <b>tabulate</b> dinoflagellates in thin flakes of Cretaceous flint and considered those dinoflagellates to have been silicified. Along with them, and of comparable size, were spheroidal to ovoidal bodies bearing an array of spines or tubes of variable character. Ehrenberg interpreted these as being originally siliceous and thought them to be desmids (freshwater conjugating algae), placing them within his own Recent desmid genus Xanthidium. Though summaries of Ehrenberg's work appeared earlier, it was not published in full until 1837 or 1838; the date is uncertain.|$|E
25|$|The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP), {{based in}} {{suburban}} Philadelphia, {{is a nonprofit}} organization devoted to preventing medication errors and the safe use of medications. Its medication error prevention efforts began in 1975 with a column in Hospital Pharmacy to inform healthcare professionals and others about medication error prevention. ISMP operates a voluntary practitioner error-reporting program to <b>tabulate</b> errors nationally, understand their causes, and share “lessons learned” with the healthcare community, known as the Medication Errors Reporting Program (MERP), operated by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) in cooperation with ISMP. In addition, ISMP’s corporate subsidiary, Med-E.R.R.S. (Medical Error Recognition and Revision Strategies), works directly and confidentially with the pharmaceutical industry to prevent errors that stem from confusing or misleading naming, labeling, packaging, and device design. The ISMP list of error-prone abbreviations is distributed nationally.|$|E
25|$|Statistical {{mechanics}} {{is commonly}} used to explain the thermodynamic behaviour of large systems. This branch of statistical mechanics, which treats and extends classical thermodynamics, is known as statistical thermodynamics or equilibrium statistical mechanics. Microscopic mechanical laws do not contain concepts such as temperature, heat, or entropy; however, statistical mechanics shows how these concepts arise from the natural uncertainty {{about the state of}} a system when that system is prepared in practice. The benefit of using statistical mechanics is that it provides exact methods to connect thermodynamic quantities (such as heat capacity) to microscopic behaviour, whereas, in classical thermodynamics, the only available option would be to just measure and <b>tabulate</b> such quantities for various materials. Statistical mechanics also makes it possible to extend the laws of thermodynamics to cases which are not considered in classical thermodynamics, such as microscopic systems and other mechanical systems with few degrees of freedom.|$|E

500|$|Federal {{observers}} are tasked with observing poll worker and voter conduct at polling places during an election and observing election officials <b>tabulate</b> the ballots. The {{goal of the}} federal observer provision is to facilitate minority voter participation by deterring and documenting instances of discriminatory conduct in the election process, such as election officials denying qualified minority persons the right to cast a ballot, intimidation or harassment of voters on election day, or improper vote counting. Discriminatory conduct that federal observers document may also serve as evidence in subsequent enforcement lawsuits. Since 1965, the Attorney General has certified 153 local governments across 11 states, but given time and resource constraints, federal {{observers are}} not assigned to every certified jurisdiction for every election.
