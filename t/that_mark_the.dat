5|$|A {{somewhat}} different DAG-based formulation of scheduling constraints {{is used by}} the program evaluation and review technique (PERT), a method for management of large human projects {{that was one of the}} first applications of DAGs. In this method, the vertices of a DAG represent milestones of a project rather than specific tasks to be performed. Instead, a task or activity is represented by an edge of a DAG, connecting two milestones <b>that</b> <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> beginning and completion of the task. Each such edge is labeled with an estimate for the amount of time that it will take a team of workers to perform the task. The longest path in this DAG represents the critical path of the project, the one that controls the total time for the project. Individual milestones can be scheduled according to the lengths of the longest paths ending at their vertices.|$|E
5|$|During warmer weather, {{the wood}} turtle {{stays in the}} water for a larger {{percentage}} of the time. For this reason, during the winter months (and the late fall and early spring) it is considered an aquatic turtle. November through February or March is spent in hibernation {{at the bottom of a}} small, flowing river. The wood turtle may hibernate alone or in large groups. During this period, individuals bury themselves in the thick mud at the bottom of the river and rarely move. During hibernation, it is vulnerable to flash floods. Emergence does not occur until March or sometimes April, months <b>that</b> <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> beginning of its activation period (males are typically more active than females at this time).|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 {{threatened}} {{to derail the}} 1942 season, but most college teams played on, adjusting schedules to include military teams composed of players serving in the military. The Buckeyes opened the season by beating a Fort Knox team 59–0, followed by two more wins against Southern California and Indiana University. In the first AP Poll of the season, Ohio State was ranked best in the nation, {{the first time the}} school had achieved <b>that</b> <b>mark.</b> <b>The</b> 1942 team was the first composed mainly of players hand-picked by Brown, including Bill Willis, Dante Lavelli and star halfback Les Horvath. In the middle of the season, the Buckeyes lost to the University of Wisconsin after numerous players drank bad water and got sick. That was the team's only loss of the season, which culminated with a 21–7 victory over Michigan. The Buckeyes won the Western Conference and claimed their first-ever national title after finishing the season {{at the top of the}} AP Poll.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{intercourse}} is {{the major}} mode of HIV transmission. Both X4 and R5 HIV {{are present in the}} seminal fluid, which is passed from a male to his sexual partner. The virions can then infect numerous cellular targets and disseminate into the whole organism. However, a selection process leads to a predominant transmission of the R5 virus through this pathway. In patients infected with subtype B HIV-1, there is often a co-receptor switch in late-stage disease and T-tropic variants appear that can infect a variety of T cells through CXCR4. These variants then replicate more aggressively with heightened virulence that causes rapid T cell depletion, immune system collapse, and opportunistic infections <b>that</b> <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> advent of AIDS. Thus, during the course of infection, viral adaptation to the use of CXCR4 instead of CCR5 may be a key step in the progression to AIDS. A number of studies with subtype B-infected individuals have determined that between 40 and 50 percent of AIDS patients can harbour viruses of the SI and, it is presumed, the X4 phenotypes.|$|E

25|$|After four years' work, {{the river}} was {{diverted}} from its meandering natural course which passed Blacon, Saughall, Shotwick Castle, Burton and Parkgate and up the west shore of Wirral. Instead the new canalised section followed the coast along northeast Wales. During this time, Sealand and Shotton were reclaimed from the estuary: see Sealand, Flintshire#Timeline. Land reclamation in this area continued until 1916.

The Bucks would play their first conference schedule in 1913 and be limited by its rules to just seven games a season. The price {{at the time was}} steep: Michigan had left the conference in 1906 and conference policy forbade playing the Wolverines.|$|E

25|$|Born into an upper-class {{household}} {{with strong}} political connections, Manet rejected the future originally envisioned for him, and became engrossed {{in the world}} of painting. His early masterworks, The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe) and Olympia, both 1863, caused great controversy and served as rallying points for the young painters who would create Impressionism. Today, these are considered watershed paintings <b>that</b> <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> start of modern art. The last 20 years of Manet's life saw him form bonds with other great artists of the time, and develop his own style that would be heralded as innovative and serve as a major influence for future painters.|$|E
25|$|The Court was {{determined}} to simultaneously save capital punishment in the United States and impose some reasoned basis for carrying it out. That reasoning flows from the Eighth Amendment's {{cruel and unusual punishment}} clause. Although capital punishment, per se, was not found by the Court to be cruel and unusual, it must still be carried out {{in a manner consistent with}} the evolving standards of decency <b>that</b> <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> progress of a maturing society. In the Court's view, the country's history with capital punishment suggests that those evolving standards of decency could not tolerate a return to the mandatory death penalty for murder that had prevailed in medieval England.|$|E

NY434 and the freeway again turn to match, proceeding generally eastward across an area of marshland along the southern edge of the river valley. Past the marsh, the valley swerves southward for a second time, taking the Susquehanna River and the two roads alongside it into an area with firmer ground.

25|$|If {{the people}} {{come to believe that}} the {{constitution}} is not a text like other texts; if it means, not what it says or what it was understood to mean, but what it should mean, in light of the evolving standards of decency <b>that</b> <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> progress of a maturing society, they will look for qualifications other than impartiality, judgment, and lawyerly acumen in those whom they elect to interpret it. More specifically, they will look for people who agree with them as to what those evolving standards have evolved to; who agree with them as to what the constitution ought to be. If the courts are free to write the constitution anew, they will write it the way the majority wants; the appointment and confirmation process will see to that. This suggests the end of the Bill of Rights, whose meaning will be committed to the very body it was meant to protect against: the majority.
