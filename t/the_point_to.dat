25|$|In {{their season}} finale against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Alabama won 7–0 at Legion Field on Thanksgiving Day.

The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against Vanderbilt to 11–9.|$|E
25|$|The river becomes tidal at Maisemore, on the West Channel {{just north}} of Gloucester, and at Llanthony Weir on the East Channel.

25|$|One can use {{the same}} {{principle}} to specify the position of any point in three-dimensional space by three Cartesian coordinates, its signed distances to three mutually perpendicular planes (or, equivalently, by its perpendicular projection onto three mutually perpendicular lines). In general, n Cartesian coordinates (an element of real n-space) specify the point in an n-dimensional Euclidean space for any dimension n. These coordinates are equal, up to sign, to distances from <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> n mutually perpendicular hyperplanes.|$|E

In each gospel these five {{events in the}} life of Jesus are treated with more intense detail than any other portion of that gospel's narrative. Scholars note that the reader receives an almost hour-by-hour account of what is happening. The death and resurrection of Jesus are treated as the climax of the story, <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> which everything else has been moving all the while.|$|E
25|$|Bid-a-Note—The host read {{a clue to}} a {{song and}} the contestants alternated bidding as to how few notes (from a maximum of seven) they needed to {{identify}} the song. Bidding ended when one contestant challenged the other to name the tune or a bid of one (or even zero) notes was given by a player. Correctly identifying the song earned the contestant a point, while missing it gave <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the opponent. It took three points to win the game, {{and for most of}} the 1974 series and all of the 1984 series, it was the last game of the day, determining the winner of the match.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{the plane}} was {{described}} in a so-called Cartesian coordinate system, a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane {{by a pair of}} numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances from <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> two fixed perpendicular directed lines, measured in the same unit of length. Each reference line is called a coordinate axis or just axis of the system, and the point where they meet is its origin, usually at ordered pair (0, 0). The coordinates can also be defined as the positions of the perpendicular projections of the point onto the two axes, expressed as signed distances from the origin.|$|E

25|$|In October 1986 {{the last}} major change to the FidoNet network was released, adding zones and points. Zones {{represented}} major geographical areas roughly corresponding to continents. There were six zones in total, North America, South America, Europe, Oceania, Asia, and Africa. Points represented non-public nodes, which were created privately on a BBS system. Point mail was delivered to a selected host BBS as normal, but then re-packaged into a packet for <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> pick up on-demand. The complete addressing format was now zone:net/node.point, so a real example might be Bob Smith@1:250/250.10. Points were widely used only for a short time, the introduction of offline reader systems filled this role with systems that were much easier to use. Points remain in use to this day, but are less popular than when they were introduced.|$|E

500|$|Gringer also assailed the NPVIC as [...] "an end-run {{around the}} {{constitutional}} amendment process".

500|$|Alexander Gambotto-Burke {{felt the}} {{character}} was {{a presentation of}} Avellone's criticisms of the Star Wars mythos and the morality presented in most post-Garriott video games, and called her [...] "a tutorial, an incentive to explore moral avenues you might have otherwise ignored". Gambotto-Burke considered her not purely evil, and felt even {{at the end of}} the game [...] "you can't help but see her as a flawed visionary".

500|$|Disston's {{engineers}} {{focused on}} Lake Okeechobee as well.

[...] Disston sponsored the digging of a canal [...] long from Lake Okeechobee towards Miami, but it was abandoned when the rock proved denser than the engineers had expected. Though the canals lowered the groundwater, their capacity was inadequate for the wet season. A report that evaluated the failure of the project concluded: [...] "The reduction of the waters is simply a question of sufficient capacity in the canals which may be dug for their relief".|$|E
50|$|After {{the judges}} and contestants' scores, Pantelis and Aris were tied with 29 points and Costas and Eleftheria were tied with 27 points.
