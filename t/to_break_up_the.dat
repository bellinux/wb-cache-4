5|$|Live is a live album by American singer Usher. It was {{recorded}} on October 15 and 16, 1998 in the singer's hometown of Chattanooga, Tennessee, and released by LaFace Records on March23,1999. Both audio-only and video longform versions were released; it was distributed <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> gap between Usher's {{second and third}} studio albums, My Way (1997) and 8701 (2001).|$|E
5|$|Manhattan {{press agent}} Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) {{has been unable}} to gain {{mentions}} for his clients in J.J. Hunsecker's (Burt Lancaster) influential, nationally syndicated newspaper column of late because of Falco's failure to make good on a promise <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> romance between Hunsecker's younger sister Susan (Susan Harrison) and musician Steve Dallas (Martin Milner), an up-and-coming jazz guitarist.|$|E
50|$|David Campbell {{conducted}} the strings for the song. Since Shinoda performed the main loop on the keyboards, the cellists {{had a difficult}} time performing the loop. Eventually, they resorted <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phrase, in which each cellist plays one or two notes.|$|R

5|$|The rush: If {{the prey}} {{attempts}} to flee, the wolves immediately pursue it. This {{is the most}} critical stage of the hunt, as wolves may never catch up with prey running at top speed. If their prey is travelling in a group, the wolves either attempt <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> herd, or isolate one or two animals from it.|$|E
5|$|At the Boston {{quarantine}} zone, Ellie becomes {{caught in}} a fight with a group of boys who attempt to steal her belongings. Riley Abel steps in <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> fight, beating one of the boys and making the others flee. Ellie becomes angered by this, claiming that she can take care of herself. Riley then advises Ellie to flee, but the latter is caught and assigned to cleaning duty. While she is completing the chore, she realizes that Riley stole her Walkman, and later demands that she return it, which Riley reluctantly does.|$|E
5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 365/8, with Evans on 47 not out. Johnston had the pick of the bowling figures, with 4/95. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> wicket and make the surface more likely to spin.|$|E
50|$|Larceny {{has been}} {{abolished}} in England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and the Republic of Ireland due <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> generalised crime of larceny into the specific crimes of burglary, robbery, fraud, theft, and related crimes. However, larceny remains an offence {{in parts of}} the United States and in New South Wales, Australia, involving the taking (caption) and carrying away (asportation) of personal property.|$|R

5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 8/365. Johnson ended with 1/85 from 21 overs and was the most uneconomical of the Australian bowlers, conceding runs {{at a rate of}} 4.04 per over while the others averaged 3.26. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley the right to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> wicket, make it more likely to spin and therefore more difficult for Australia to bat on.|$|E
5|$|England {{declared}} at 8/365 {{after two}} overs {{on the last}} day. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> wicket {{and make it more}} likely to spin. Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his belief that such a device would only make batting more difficult.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} innings, Loxton took 0/29 from ten overs, and England batted on {{for five minutes}} on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 8/365. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller. This would help <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> wicket and make the surface more likely to spin, therefore making life more difficult for Australia’s batsmen.|$|E

50|$|The Farmall Cub, A, B, 100, 130, and 140 models had {{the seat}} offset from the engine, {{allowing}} the operator to {{look directly at}} the ground under the tractor. This feature was called Culti-Vision because it was created to give the operator an excellent view of the cultivator teeth as they cultivated the vegetable row. (Cultivating in this context refers <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> soil next <b>to</b> the vegetable row, which kills weeds by uprooting them and/or burying their leaves).|$|R
5|$|Leigh-Mallory {{claimed the}} Big Wings had {{destroyed}} entire formations of enemy aircraft upon seeing them. He even claimed the RAF outnumbered their opponents in several engagements. In the afternoon battle, {{he claimed that}} the Wing could not get into position <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> bombers in time and was intercepted by German fighters. Still, while that was true he also claimed his units had shot down 105 enemy aircraft and probably destroyed a further 40. He claimed another 18 damaged {{for the loss of}} 14 and six pilots.|$|E
5|$|On July 1, 1922, 400,000 {{railroad}} workers went on strike. Harding {{proposed a}} settlement that made some concessions, but management objected. Attorney General Daugherty convinced Judge James H. Wilkerson {{to issue a}} sweeping injunction <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> strike. Although there was {{public support for the}} Wilkerson injunction, Harding felt it went too far, and had Daugherty and Wilkerson amend it. The injunction succeeded in ending the strike; however, tensions remained high between railroad workers and management for years.|$|E
5|$|On November 17, 2014, the Cardinals traded Miller and {{prospect}} Tyrell Jenkins to the Atlanta Braves for outfielder Jason Heyward {{and relief}} pitcher Jordan Walden. On May 5, 2015, Miller threw a complete game shutout in just 99 pitches against the Philadelphia Phillies. Twelve days later, Miller was one out away from throwing a no-hitter against the Miami Marlins at Marlins Park when pinch hitter Justin Bour singled <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> bid. Miller {{settled for a}} two-hit shutout, beating the Marlins 6–0. After the game, he improved to a 5–1 record and 1.33 ERA.|$|E
5000|$|The finale is {{difficult}} to assign to a definite form. Although there are passages with expository and developmental aspects, its overall function is the recapitulation of all the material from the previous two movements. After a certain point, Enescu turns his attention <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> rhythms within the [...] metre, first into twos, then fours, fives, nines, and tens, as well as superimposing them until finally the underlying ternary rhythm is broken and transformed into a binary metre [...]|$|R

5|$|The Eurasian sparrowhawk's pale underparts {{and darker}} upperparts are {{an example of}} countershading, which helps <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> bird's outline. Countershading is {{exhibited}} by birds of prey which hunt birds and other fast-moving animals. The horizontal barring seen on adult Eurasian sparrowhawks is typical of woodland-dwelling predatory birds, while the adult male's bluish colour is also seen in other bird-eating raptors, including the peregrine falcon, the merlin and other Accipiters.|$|E
5|$|The Lerwick Up Helly Aa is one {{of several}} fire festivals held in Shetland {{annually}} in the middle of winter -- it is always started on the last Tuesday of January. The festival is just over 100 years old in its present, highly organised form. Originally, a festival held <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> long nights of winter and mark the end of Yule, the festival has become one celebrating the isles' heritage and includes a procession of men dressed as Vikings and the burning of a replica longship.|$|E
5|$|Then, in a {{calculated}} attack, approximately 500 Arsenal fans attacked {{from the main}} road behind the Galatasaray fans. This caused a severe riot in the city square, with several restaurant facilities used by fans to fight each other, with iron bars and knives also being used. This lasted 20 minutes before the Danish police attempted <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> melee with dogs and tear gas. The violence, which included fans from other English clubs and Turks living in Denmark, lasted for 45 minutes. There were further clashes at the airport {{the day after the}} game.|$|E

40|$|We {{attempt to}} {{overcome}} the serious data problems of past telecommunications cost studies by focusing on local exchange carriers (LECs). With enough degrees of freedom to yield precise estimates, our global subadditivity tests show that the cost function is definitely not subadditive. The results suggest that <b>the</b> benefits <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> monopoly outputs of existing LECs substantially outweigh the potential losses in efficiency. They also support permitting entry and increasing competition in local exchange markets. Furthermore, given the competitive nature of long distance service, {{it is doubtful that}} the predivestiture Bell System was a natural monopoly. ...|$|R

5|$|A Japanese convoy {{approaching}} Endau {{was detected}} by reconnaissance aircraft on 26 January and was ineffectually attacked multiple times by Allied aircraft as it was landing its troops. The Allies suffered heavy casualties, while the Japanese lost only a single aircraft. The Royal Navy committed two destroyers later that day <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Japanese landings, despite the much larger Japanese escort force. Sailing {{under the cover of}} darkness, they were able to locate the convoy anchored there without being detected, but could not find the troopships in the darkness. The ships attempted to disengage, but were fired upon by the convoy's escorts and one destroyer was sunk {{in the early morning hours}} of 27 January.|$|E
5|$|As Vandygriff and his {{men began}} pulling back from the mountain, North Korean fire was falling in the platoon area from nearly all directions. The squad leaders started <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> weapons that the platoon could not take out with them. At this time they {{discovered}} Brown was dead. Vandygriff told his troops not to remove the identification tags from the dead they would be leaving behind, as the tags {{would be the only}} means of identification later. Vandygriff put his platoon in a V formation and led them off the hill by the same trail they had ascended, picking up four wounded men on the way down.|$|E
5|$|At Issus in 333BC, {{his first}} {{confrontation}} with Darius, {{he used the}} same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through. Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army. At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing the latter to flee once again.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, P.O.S,, rapper Syst (short for System) and DJ Anomaly {{formed a}} {{short-lived}} hip-hop group Cenospecies.

50|$|At {{the height}} of the crisis in 2009, the {{shipping}} industry was badly affected. Jacques R. Saadé was opposed <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Group. Supported by his son Rodolphe Saadé, and daughter Tanya Saadé, he was convinced container transport sector would bounce back. In 2010, CMA CGM signed an agreement with the family-run industrial Turkish group YILDIRIM. The agreement enabled the Group to strengthen its financial structure and secure finance for its investment plans. This also later led him to invest, notably in building the Group’s first three 16,000 teu vessels: the CMA CGM Marco Polo, the CMA CGM Alexander Von Humboldt, and the CMA CGM Jules Verne.|$|R
50|$|The band {{continued}} {{writing and}} touring {{for a third}} album, including drawing {{the attention of a}} Warner Bros. Records subsidiary.
