There was some concern that the level of media coverage at the time could jeopardise a trial. <b>The</b> <b>murders</b> also sparked debates in the media over the laws surrounding prostitution.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{agreement}} {{as to the}} order in which <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> took place.

The second was {{in the form of an}} interview with the Edinburgh Courant that was published on 7 February 1829. These in turn differed from the order given in Hare's statement, although the pair were agreed on many of the points of <b>the</b> <b>murders.</b> Contemporary reports also differ from the confessions of the two men. More recent sources, including the accounts written by Brian Bailey, Lisa Rosner and Owen Dudley Edwards, either follow one of the historic versions or present their own order of events.|$|E
