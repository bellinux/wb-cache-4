Since long-term pharmacotherapy is needed for treatment of panic disorder, the present results suggest that development of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>strategy</b> for panic patients with high reward dependence is needed.|$|E

Some data from in vitro and animal studies suggested that fatty acid uptake through CD36 may promote cancer cell migration and proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma, and potentially other cancers; there was limited data from observational studies in people that low CD36 may correlate with a slightly better outcome in glioblastoma.|$|E

Application of this strategy helps to minimize the exposure of patients to allogeneic blood products which have certain risks; and it saves costs.

40|$|Disease and its {{healing in}} most of the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>strategies</b> are mainly based either on {{physical}} or metaphysical aspects. <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>strategies</b> in Islam, on the other hand, are based on a combination of spiritual, psychological, and material means.

This paper examines how the guidelines and principles of the Qur’an and Sunnah may contribute to the understanding and evaluation of different therapeutic interventions.

25|$|GAPDH is overexpressed in {{multiple}} human cancers, such as cutaneous melanoma, and its expression is {{positively correlated with}} tumor progression. Its glycolytic and antiapoptotic functions contribute to proliferation and protection of tumor cells, promoting tumorigenesis. Notably, GAPDH protects against telomere shortening induced by chemotherapeutic drugs that stimulate the sphingolipid ceramide. Meanwhile, conditions like oxidative stress impair GAPDH function, leading to cellular aging and death. Moreover, depletion of GAPDH has managed to induce senescence in tumor cells, thus presenting a novel <b>therapeutic</b> <b>strategy</b> for controlling tumor growth.|$|E
25|$|Some anticancer drugs target mtDNA {{and have}} shown {{positive}} results in killing tumor cells. Research has used mitochondrial mutations as biomarkers for cancer cell therapy. It {{is easier to}} target mutation within mitochondrial DNA versus nuclear DNA because the mitochondrial genome is much smaller and easier to screen for specific mutations. MtDNA content alterations found in blood samples {{might be able to}} serve as a screening marker for predicting future cancer susceptibility as well as tracking malignant tumor progression. Along with these potential helpful characteristics of mtDNA, it is not {{under the control of the}} cell cycle and is important for maintaining ATP generation and mitochondrial homeostasis. These characteristics make targeting mtDNA a practical <b>therapeutic</b> <b>strategy.</b>|$|E
25|$|HbS {{has a lower}} {{negative}} charge at physiological pH than does normal adult hemoglobin. The consequences of the simple replacement of a charged amino acid with a hydrophobic, neutral amino acid are far ranging, Recent studies in West Africa suggest that the greatest impact of Hb S {{seems to be to}} protect against either death or severe disease—that is, profound anemia or cerebral malaria—while having less effect on infection per se. Children who are heterozygous for the sickle cell gene have only one- tenth the risk of death from falciparum as do those who are homozygous for the normal hemoglobin gene. Binding of parasitized sickle erythrocytes to endothelial cells and blood monocytes is significantly reduced due to an altered display of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP-1), the parasite’s major cytoadherence ligand and virulence factor on the erythrocyte surface. Protection also derives from the instability of sickle hemoglobin, which clusters the predominant integral red cell membrane protein (called band 3) and triggers accelerated removal by phagocytic cells. Natural antibodies recognize these clusters on senescent erythrocytes. Protection by HbAS involves the enhancement of not only innate but also of acquired immunity to the parasite. Prematurely denatured sickle hemoglobin results in an up regulation of natural antibodies which control erythrocyte adhesion in both malaria and sickle cell disease. Targeting the stimuli that lead to endothelial activation will constitute a promising <b>therapeutic</b> <b>strategy</b> to inhibit sickle red cell adhesion and vasco-occlusion.|$|E

UC is an idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases defined by chronically relapsing inflammations of the gastrointestinal tract, and characterized by a superficial, continuous mucosal inflammation, which predominantly affects the large intestine. Patients that do not effectively respond to current UC treatment strategies exhibit serious drawbacks one of which may lead to colorectal surgery, and {{can result in a}} severely compromised quality of life. Thus, patients with moderate or severe UC may significantly benefit from these new therapeutic alternatives, of which SB012 is in phase I clinical trials.|$|E

40|$|HIV- 1 {{infection}} {{is one of}} the leading causes of childhood morbidity and mortality globally and mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the major mode of infection. Over the past decade, natural history and interventional studies have improved our understanding of the pathogenesis of MTCT and pediatric HIV- 1 infection. This has resulted in the development of effective preventive strategies to reduce new infections and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>strategies</b> to improve outcome following infection. However, successful implementation of these preventive and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>strategies</b> has been limited in resource-poor settings, where the majority of new pediatric infections occur.

40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} indicates that acute and chronic uncontrolled overproduction of oxidative stress-related factors including reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), atherosclerosis, and diabetes. Moreover ROS mediate various signaling pathways underlying vascular inflammation in ischemic tissues. With respect to stem cell-based therapy, several studies clearly indicate that modulating antioxidant production at cellular levels enhances stem/progenitor cell functionalities, including proliferation, long-term survival in ischemic tissues, and complete differentiation of transplanted cells into mature vascular cells. Recently emerging <b>therapeutic</b> <b>strategies</b> involving adult stem cells, including endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), for treating ischemic CVDs have highlighted the need to control intracellular ROS production, because it critically affects the replicative senescence of ex vivo expanded therapeutic cells. Better understanding {{of the complexity of}} cellular ROS in stem cell biology might improve cell survival in ischemic tissues and enhance the regenerative potentials of transplanted stem/progenitor cells. In this review, we will discuss the nature and sources of ROS, drug-based <b>therapeutic</b> <b>strategies</b> for scavenging ROS, and EPC based <b>therapeutic</b> <b>strategies</b> for treating oxidative stress-related CVDs. Furthermore, we will discuss whether primed EPCs pretreated with natural ROS-scavenging compounds are crucial and promising <b>therapeutic</b> <b>strategies</b> for vascular repair...|$|R
