5|$|After killing Yeates, Tabak {{attempted}} to cast suspicion {{for the murder}} onto Jefferies after watching a news broadcast about the case while spending the New Year with relatives in the Netherlands. He contacted Avon and Somerset Police <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> Jefferies had been using his car {{on the night of}} 17 December, and a CID officer, DC Karen Thomas, was sent to Amsterdam to talk to him. They met at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport on 31 December, where Tabak elaborated on his story, but Thomas grew suspicious of his interest in the forensic work being carried out by the police and because what he said did not concur with a previous statement.|$|E
5|$|While Lody was {{travelling}} to Killarney on {{the morning}} of 2 October, an Edinburgh City Police detective was ordered to enquire at hotels for a person named Inglis. The detective found that Lody had stayed at the Roxburgh Hotel and was shown his luggage, which still had a label attached bearing the name and address Charles A. Inglis, Bedford House, 12Drumsheugh Gardens. An interview with the proprietor of the boarding-house where Lody had stayed enabled the police to reconstruct his movements, while the manageress of the Roxburgh was able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> he had gone to Ireland.|$|E
5|$|After Guy and Joanna have sex, Martin arrives <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> Joanna is Guy's mother. She met Guy's father whilst {{she was an}} {{exchange}} student in Switzerland. Guy then stabs a syringe full of Botox into Martin's legs {{as an act of}} revenge. Martin is taken into an ambulance, and Caroline helps Joanna, but Guy punches Mac in a drunken rage and steals the ambulance. Mac tries to stop him and gets on the ambulance, which drives away. Guy drives the ambulance to Wales, with Mac and the paralysed Martin with him. Whilst Mac tries to phone the police, Guy drives into a field and almost goes over a cliff. The first series ends with Guy, Mac and Martin teetering on the edge – a literal cliffhanger – while ending up in a discussion about which of The Three Musketeers they are most like.|$|E

5|$|Reports were sketchy {{initially}} – television pictures {{broadcast on}} ITV showed Stein, {{who appeared to}} be both conscious and alert, being carried down the tunnel by a number of police officers, with commentator Brian Moore speculating that he had been overcome with the emotion of the result. BBC Radio commentator Peter Jones (who had no access to the television pictures and was relying on information from other people in the press box) also speculated that the tension of the result and the night had led to Stein's collapse. Willie Miller, the Scottish captain on the night in the absence of Graeme Souness, was informed by Martin Tyler of ITV Sport during the post-match interview that Stein had collapsed, with Alex Ferguson entering the dressing room <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> Stein had suffered a heart attack.|$|E

25|$|Once Henry had {{withdrawn}} with {{the bulk of}} the imperial army the towns that had supposedly fallen to the Empire immediately declared their allegiance to Tancred, for the most part now fearing his retribution. Nicholas of Ajello, son of Matthew and former Archbishop of Salerno, who was helping defend Naples, wrote letters about the events to his friends in Salerno. Thus the populace of Salerno saw an opportunity to win some favour with Tancred, so they besieged the defenseless Constance at Castel Terracena. Constance presented herself on a balcony and spoke to them in the tone of mild remonstrance and admonition, trying <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the situation might improve and the defeat of Henry might be exaggerated by Nicholas, but the Salernitans were determined to capture her for Tancred, so they continued the siege. Constance locked herself in her room, locked the windows, and prayed to God for help and revenge. After a rapid negotiation with Elia di Gesualdo, a distant relative of Tancred, Constance voluntarily went out under the condition that her German garrison were to be allowed to leave unharmed. She was then arrested by Elia (and some barons of Apulia who were related to her) and delivered to Tancred in Messina by Admiral Margaritus of Brindisi (her brother-in-law who had helped in the defence of Naples), on a bireme galley or dromon with 200 rowers. She was in her attire as empress, wearing a dress quilted with gold and decorated with roses, a cloak covered with precious jewels, and her hair was strewn with gems, making her look like a goddess. Thus she became an important and valuable prize given that Henry had every intention of returning. When meeting Constance Tancred blamed her for the invasion, but she proudly responded that she was just taking back her dominion robbed by Tancred.|$|E

500|$|Science Wonders {{first issue}} {{included}} {{the first part}} of a serial, The Reign of the Ray, by Fletcher Pratt and Irwin Lester, and short stories by Stanton Coblentz and David H. Keller.

In 2005, Dio received a letter from Black informing him that production of the film was starting and requested that he play himself. This film is Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny.

Squidward complains about this, and eventually kicks the boat out of frustration after SpongeBob mentions that the pizza is getting cold. This causes the boat to suddenly drive back to the Krusty Krab, leaving the two stranded and to continue their delivery on foot.|$|E

She then began voice lessons and discovered a passion for musical theatre. By age 11, she had performed more than 40 times on stage, but was often given male parts: [...] "I got boy parts quite often. In ballet, there were not enough boys. So they ended up choosing half and half. I got chosen to wear the grey suit and the wig, and not the pretty dresses. In A Christmas Carol, I was Tiny Tim, so I got to be quite a sick, sick boy. There was a severe lack of singing boys and, at the time, it was quite disappointing." [...] Westenra attended Cobham Intermediate School in 1998 and 1999, where a performing arts building was later named in her honour.
