5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 {{was used to}} justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear {{of the opposite sex}} caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, <b>the</b> <b>psychologist</b> Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E

40|$|Acknowledging the {{importance}} of teachers’ implicit theories for the determination of school psychologist’s role, this study aims to elicit prospective teachers’ personal theories {{for the role of}} school psychologist. By using metaphoric pictures, 59 pre-service teachers described their perceptions of <b>the</b> school <b>psychologist’s</b> role in relation to other members of the school community, the expectations of both teachers and <b>the</b> school <b>psychologist</b> in relation to the role of <b>the</b> school <b>psychologist,</b> <b>the</b> variability of conditions in which <b>the</b> school <b>psychologist’s</b> role is undertaken as well as their feelings about <b>the</b> school <b>psychologist’s</b> role. Content analysis of data indicated that prospective teachers perceived <b>the</b> school <b>psychologist’s</b> role as being carried out within the school setting and as being prominent in relation to the teachers’ role. <b>The</b> school <b>psychologist</b> aims to help students and teachers to achieve their goals, while teachers perceive <b>the</b> school <b>psychologist</b> as a consultant. <b>The</b> school <b>psychologist’s</b> task is undertaken under continually changing conditions, depending mainly on the variability of people’s needs. Finally, prospective teachers described a variety of emotional responses in relation to <b>the</b> school <b>psychologist’s</b> role. These findings are discussed in terms of the expansion of <b>the</b> school <b>psychologist’s</b> role, teachers’ professional identity and the training programmes of both school psychologists and teachers. peer-reviewe...|$|R

Criticisms made of the work included that its authors' conclusions were based on an unrepresentative or dubiously representative sample of homosexuals, and that their reliance on path analysis and adult recall of early childhood feeling was problematic.|$|E
5|$|In late 1954 Reich {{began an}} affair with Grethe Hoff, a former patient.

Hoff and Sharaf had had their first child the year before Hoff left him for Reich; the {{marriage}} was never repaired although the affair had ended by June 1955. Two months later Reich began another relationship, this time with Aurora Karrer, a medical researcher, and, in November, he moved out of Orgonon to an apartment in Alban Towers, Washington, D.C., to live with her, using the pseudonym Dr. Walter Roner.|$|E
5|$|The magician John Nevil Maskelyne {{also criticized}} {{the design of}} the {{experiment}} for taking place under a table. <b>The</b> <b>psychologist</b> Millais Culpin wrote the experiment was not scientific and questioned why the experiment was done under the table instead of in a more convenient position on top of it. Before the accordion experiment with Crookes, Home had performed the accordion feat for over fifteen years under various conditions but always under his control. It was reported by sitters and Crookes that Home's accordion played only two pieces, Home Sweet Home and The Last Rose of Summer. Both contain only one-octave.|$|E

5|$|Heathens {{commonly}} adopt a cosmology {{based on}} that found in Norse mythology. As part of this framework, humanity's world—known as Midgard—is regarded as just one of nine realms, {{all of which are}} part of a cosmological world tree called Yggdrasil. Different types of being are believed to inhabit these different realms; for instance, humans live on Midgard, while dwarves live on another realm, elves on another, giants on another, and the divinities on two further realms. Most practitioners believe that this is a poetic or symbolic description of the cosmos, with the different levels representing higher realms beyond the material plane of existence. The world tree is also interpreted by some in the community as an icon for ecological and social engagement. Some Heathens, such as <b>the</b> <b>psychologist</b> Brian Bates, have adopted an approach to this cosmology rooted in analytical psychology, thereby interpreting the nine worlds and their inhabitants as maps of the human mind.|$|E
