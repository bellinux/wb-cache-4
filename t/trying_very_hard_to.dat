25|$|Besides {{top rated}} {{universities}} which provide highly competitive world class education to their pupils, India {{is also home}} to many universities which have been founded with the sole objective of making easy money. Regulatory authorities like UGC and AICTE have been <b>trying</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> extirpate the menace of private universities which are running courses without any affiliation or recognition. Indian Government has failed to check on these education shops, which are run by big businessmen & politicians. Many private colleges and universities do not fulfil the required criterion by the Government and central bodies (UGC, AICTE, MCI, BCI etc.) and take students for a ride. For example, many institutions in India continue to run unaccredited courses as there is no legislation strong enough to ensure legal action against them. Quality assurance mechanisms have failed to stop misrepresentations and malpractices in higher education. At the same time regulatory bodies have been accused of corruption, specifically in the case of deemed-universities. In this context of lack of solid quality assurance mechanism, institutions need to step-up and set higher standards of self-regulation.|$|E
500|$|On August 23, 1969, Presley was {{featured}} {{on the cover of}} Rolling Stone, with the album receiving the lead review. Peter Guralnick, the magazine's reviewer, described it as [...] "great... Flatly and unequivocally the equal of anything (Presley) has ever done" [...] and praised the [...] "evident passion which (Presley) has invested in this music", adding: [...] "(he) is trying, and <b>trying</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>to</b> please us. he needs to have our attention... It is his involvement after all which comes as the surprise." [...] Billboard also published a positive review, saying that Presley had [...] "never sounded better, and the choice of material is perfect". High Fidelity wrote, [...] "Elvis has been through a number of stages, and his latest is the best".|$|E
500|$|Three years later, in the {{build-up}} to {{the release}} of Manhunt 2, the controversy re-ignited. Two days after announcing the game, which was set for release in July, Take-Two Interactive (Rockstar's parent company) issued a statement which read, in part: [...] "We are aware that in direct contradiction to all available evidence, certain individuals continue to link the original Manhunt title to the Warren Leblanc case in 2004. The transcript of the court case makes it quite clear what really happened. At sentencing the Judge, defense, prosecution and Leicester police all emphasized that Manhunt played no part in the case." [...] Later that day, however, Patrick and Giselle Pakeerah condemned the decision to release a sequel, and insisted that Manhunt was a factor in their son's murder. Upon the announcement of the sequel, Patrick stated [...] "I'm very disappointed. This is rubbing salt into the wounds in the month we will be marking the anniversary of Stefan's death. I'm very surprised they are doing this after all that has happened and all the publicity." [...] Giselle added [...] "It is an insult to my son's memory that they have announced this game in the month we will be marking this anniversary. These game moguls are {{making a lot of money}} out of games which are morally indecent. Why do they have to pump more violence into society?" [...] Leicester East MP Keith Vaz supported the Pakeerahs, claiming he was [...] "astonished" [...] that Rockstar were making a sequel; [...] "It is contempt for those who are <b>trying</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> ensure something is done to control the violent nature of these games." ...|$|E

SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell said at the Singapore Satellite Industry Forum in summer 2013 [...] "If we get this [...] right, and we’re <b>trying</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> get this right, we’re looking at launches {{to be in the}} [...] range, which would really change things dramatically." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{influence}} on bicycle culture from Copenhagen is the [...] Cycle chic movement. It grew from reactions to {{a photo of}} a girl wearing her regular clothes on a bike, which inspired the photographer, Michael Colville-Andersen, to start the blog Copenhagen Cycle Chic featuring mainly female subjects riding their bikes in fashionable everyday clothes. Its popularity have spawned a global movement with over 100 Cycle Chic blogs featuring similarly themed photography from other cities and areas around the world. Bloggers around the world are <b>trying</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> get featured on the Cycle Chic blog because they think it's cool. So now many people are making their own blogs that feature cyclists around the world. Most of them are associated with the original blog, the Copenhagen Cycle Chic.|$|E
2500|$|Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum {{were the}} only {{candidates}} to accept the invitation to participate. The campaigns of Jon Huntsman and Ron Paul both released statements declining the invitation. Ron Paul's campaign wrote, [...] "Mr. Trump's participation will contribute to an unwanted circus-like atmosphere," [...] while Jon Huntsman's campaign said in a statement, [...] "We have declined {{to participate in the}} 'Presidential Apprentice' Debate with The Donald," [...] alluding to the Celebrity Apprentice reality show for which Trump is host. Trump responded, [...] "Few people take Ron Paul seriously and many of his views and presentation make him a clown-like candidate. I am glad he and Jon Huntsman, who has inconsequential poll numbers or a chance of winning, will not be attending the debate and wasting the time of the viewers who are <b>trying</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> make a very important decision." ...|$|E

This is honest. Hosting The Tonight Show has been the fulfillment of a lifelong dream for me. And I just want to say to the kids out there watching: You can do anything you want in life. Yeah, yeah—unless Jay Leno wants to do it, too." [...] Following the joke, Leno called Gaspin, asking, [...] "Why the fuck am I giving up a half hour for this guy?" [...] Conversations changed as to how much O'Brien would take to resolve the matter, and parties began to discuss a settlement.|$|E
2500|$|Some photographers {{have found}} {{creative}} ways around these limitations. Louie Liotta of The New York Post told John Tierney {{he holds his}} camera near the ground, pointing upward, and walks with it for a short distance, {{in order to get}} a shot of the defendant's face as he or she is ducking downwards to avoid the cameras. Andrew Savulich of the Daily News looks for unusual angles and juxtapositions, once putting the station house's sleeping cat in the foreground. To catch the defendant's face, he stands near the front door at the top of the steps. [...] "For some reason, even when a guy has decided to duck his head, he usually lifts it for a second when he starts to go down steps", he explains. [...] "You sometimes catch this lost-in-space look, the eyes fixed at a distance, as if he's <b>trying</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> be somewhere else." [...] Jim Estrin of the Times says the police officers at the door sometimes block that shot for him, so he starts in the middle, shooting as he runs, and then gets on the other side of the police car for a shot as the defendant enters.|$|E

6000|$|Madame Yonsmit was a decayed gentlewoman {{who carried}} on her {{decomposition}} {{in a modest}} wayside cottage in Thuringia. She was an excellent sample of the Thuringian widow, a species not yet extinct, but <b>trying</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> become so. The same may {{be said of the}} whole genus. Madame Yonsmit was quite young, very comely, cultivated, gracious, and pleasing. Her home was a nest of domestic virtues, but she had a daughter who reflected but little credit upon the nest. Feodora was indeed a [...] "bad egg"--a very wicked and ungrateful egg. You could see she was by her face. The girl had the most vicious countenance--it was repulsive! It was a face in which boldness struggled for the supremacy with cunning, and both were thrashed into subjection by avarice. It was this latter virtue in Feodora which kept her mother from having a taxable income.|$|E
60|$|After <b>trying</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> {{get rid of}} the {{necessity}} of clearing herself, Mary, advised by LORD HERRIES, her best friend in England, agreed to answer the charges against her, if the Scottish noblemen who made them would attend to maintain them before such English noblemen as Elizabeth might appoint for that purpose. Accordingly, such an assembly, under the name of a conference, met, first at York, and afterwards at Hampton Court. In its presence Lord Lennox, Darnley's father, openly charged Mary with the murder of his son; and whatever Mary's friends may now say or write in her behalf, there is no doubt that, when her brother Murray produced against her a casket containing certain guilty letters and verses which he stated to have passed between her and Bothwell, she withdrew from the inquiry. Consequently, it is to be supposed that she was then considered guilty by those who had the best opportunities of judging of the truth, and that the feeling which afterwards arose in her behalf was a very generous but not a very reasonable one.|$|E

Still, everything drifts on to these hugger-mugger large enterprises; Chicago spreads over the world. One thing goes after another, tobacco, tea, bacon, drugs, bookselling. Decent homes destroyed right and left. Not Harman's affair, I suppose.

60|$|It was tedious work, no doubt; but Sophy felt so much {{pleasure}} in bringing home her earnings {{at the end}} of the week, that, as she said, she really liked it. Besides this, it was a break to the monotony of her life; for, after a while, Robert took to going out after breakfast and not returning until five o'clock to dinner, being engaged, as he said, in looking for something to do; and, indeed, he did believe that he was <b>trying</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> get employment, although he had not the least idea what kind of work he needed. He sauntered across the bridge, went into a public-house to read the paper, and look through all the advertisements in the vague hope of seeing something to suit him. Three or four advertisements, indeed, he answered; but received no reply. Still he comforted himself with the assurance that it did not matter for that--the will was sure to be found; and that it was therefore really as well that he should not undertake a situation which he should, when he became a rich man, be sorry that he had filled. For the same reason he tried hard to persuade Sophy not to enter into the teaching business, as it would be humiliating to look back upon afterwards; but Sophy replied that she could see nothing to be ashamed of in the remembrance that she had tried her best to get her living, at a time when she had thought it necessary that she should do so. And in this particular she insisted on having her own way.|$|E
