5|$|In {{the domain}} of secular music, Josquin left {{numerous}} French chansons, for from three to six voices, {{as well as a}} handful of Italian secular songs known as frottole, as well as some pieces which were probably intended for instrumental performance. Problems of attribution are even more acute with the chansons than <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>with</b> other portions of his output: while about 70 three and four-voice chansons were published under his name during his lifetime, only six of the more than thirty five- and six-voice chansons attributed to him were circulated under his name during the same time. Many of the attributions added after his death are considered to be unreliable, and much work has been done in the last decades of the 20th century to correct attributions on stylistic grounds.|$|E
5|$|Later, Black is {{informed}} that the girls are missing. She and Means search the woods, finding the girls in a grotto. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>with</b> a teacher from the school, Ben Fisher (John Pyper-Ferguson) who attacks Means; she subdues him and he is arrested. She later confronts him, and it is revealed {{he is a former}} Group member charged with protecting the girls due to their powers. When Black later learns that Fisher has been released, she fears for McKenna's life. She rushes to the school, knowing the girls will be at a prayer meeting. She arrives just too late to prevent Alex from firing upon the meeting; Fisher is killed while shielding McKenna. Later, Means shows Black two sets of DNA test results—one from McKenna, the other from the Shroud of Turin. The profiles seem to prove that McKenna is related to Jesus Christ; Means entrusts them, and the decision as to whether to proliferate them, to Black.|$|E

5|$|The deep nuclei of the {{cerebellum}} are {{clusters of}} gray matter lying {{within the white}} matter {{at the core of}} the cerebellum. <b>They</b> <b>are,</b> <b>with</b> the minor exception of the nearby vestibular nuclei, the sole sources of output from the cerebellum. These nuclei receive collateral projections from mossy fibers and climbing fibers as well as inhibitory input from the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. The four nuclei (dentate, globose, emboliform, and fastigial) each communicate with different parts of the brain and cerebellar cortex. (The globose and the emboliform nuclei are also referred to as combined in the interposed nucleus). The fastigial and interposed nuclei belong to the spinocerebellum. The dentate nucleus, which in mammals is much larger than the others, is formed as a thin, convoluted layer of gray matter, and communicates exclusively with the lateral parts of the cerebellar cortex. The flocculonodular lobe is the only part of the cerebellar cortex that does not project to the deep nuclei—its output goes to the vestibular nuclei instead.|$|E

Tardive dyskinesia and akathisia are less commonly seen with chlorpromazine than <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>with</b> high potency typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol or trifluoperazine, and some evidence suggests that, with conservative dosing, the incidence of such effects for chlorpromazine may be comparable to that of newer agents such as risperidone or olanzapine.|$|E

25|$|Many U.S. {{law schools}} teach legal {{writing in a}} way that {{acknowledges}} the technical complexity inherent in law and the justified formality that complexity often requires, but with an emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and directness. Yet many practicing lawyers, busy as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>with</b> deadlines and heavy workloads, often resort to a template-based, outdated, hyperformal writing style in both analytical and transactional documents. This is understandable, but it sometimes unfortunately perpetuates an unnecessarily formal legal writing style.|$|E

25|$|Nature {{connectedness}} {{is related}} to subjective well-being and other indicators of positive functioning such as solving a problem in one's life. Subjective well-being is defined as feeling pleasant emotions or having pleasant experiences. To assess well-being, participants complete measures of how often they feel positive emotions (an affective measure), how often they feel negative emotions (an affective measure), and how satisfied <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>with</b> their lives (a cognitive measure). Individuals {{with higher levels of}} well-being typically indicate that they are satisfied with their lives, feel more positive emotions, and less negative emotions.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who suffer}} from social anxiety {{disorder}} fear being judged by others in society. In particular, individuals with social anxiety are nervous {{in the presence of}} people with authority and feel uncomfortable during physical examinations. People {{who suffer from}} this disorder may behave a certain way or say something and then feel embarrassed or humiliated after. As a result, they often choose to isolate themselves from society to avoid such situations. They may also feel uncomfortable meeting people they do not know, and act distant when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>with</b> large groups of people. In some cases, they may show evidence of this disorder by avoiding eye contact, or blushing when someone is talking to them.|$|E
25|$|As {{young males}} mature and leave their {{maternal}} groups, they most often remain solitary, although rarely they join an older male. Adult males of similar size/age tend to avoid one another. Occasionally, they meet and spar with their horns in a ritualised manner {{and it is}} rare for serious fights to take place. However, such fights are usually discouraged by visual displays, in which the males bulge their necks, roll their eyes, and hold their horns in a vertical position while slowly {{pacing back and forth}} {{in front of the other}} male. They seek out females only during mating time. When <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>with</b> a herd of females, males do not coerce them or try to restrict their movements as do some other antelopes.|$|E

25|$|The 11-plus {{has long}} been controversial, and Northern Ireland's {{political}} parties have taken opposing positions. Unionists tend to lean towards preserving the grammar schools as <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> <b>with</b> academic selection {{at the age of}} 11, whereas nationalist politicians lean towards scrapping the 11-plus, despite vehement protestations from the majority of Catholic Grammar Schools, most notably by the board of governors at Rathmore Grammar School in Finaghy, (a South Belfast suburb) and Lumen Christi (although co-educational) in Derry. The Democratic Unionist Party claimed to have ensured the continuation of the grammar school system in the Province as part of the St Andrews Agreement in October 2006. By contrast, Sinn Féin claims to have secured the abolition of the 11-plus and a veto over any system which might follow it.|$|E
25|$|The {{architectural}} {{style of the}} Belle Époque was eclectic and sometimes combined elements of several different styles. While the structures of the new buildings were resolutely modern, using iron frames and reinforced concrete, the façades ranged from the Romano-Byzantine style of the Basilica of Sacré-Cœur on Montmartre, to the strange neo-Moorish Palais du Trocadéro, to the neo-Renaissance style of the new Hôtel de Ville, to the exuberant reinvention of French classicism of the 17th and 18th centuries in the Grand Palais, Petit Palais and Gare d'Orsay, decorated as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>with</b> domes, colonnades, mosaics and statuary. The most innovative buildings of the period were the Gallery of Machines at the 1889 exposition and the new railroad stations and department stores: their classical exteriors concealed very modern interiors with large open spaces and large glass skylights {{made possible by the}} new engineering techniques of the period. The Eiffel Tower shocked many traditional Parisians, both because of its appearance and {{because it was the first}} building in Paris taller than the cathedral of Notre-Dame.|$|E
