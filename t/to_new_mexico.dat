5|$|In recent years, {{evidence}} for sexual dimorphism has been weakened. A 2005 {{study reported that}} previous claims of sexual dimorphism in crocodile chevron anatomy were in error, casting doubt {{on the existence of}} similar dimorphism between Tyrannosaurus rex sexes. A full-sized chevron was discovered on the first tail vertebra of Sue, an extremely robust individual, indicating that this feature could not be used to differentiate the two morphs anyway. As Tyrannosaurus rex specimens have been found from Saskatchewan <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico,</b> differences between individuals may be indicative of geographic variation rather than sexual dimorphism. The differences could also be age-related, with 'robust' individuals being older animals.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{recruits}} to Manhattan Project's Los Alamos National Laboratory, arriving in March 1943. He became acting head of the Chemistry and Metallurgy (CM) Division. There was concern amongst the project leadership about Kennedy, as he was only 26 years old at the time. An approach was therefore made to Charles Thomas from Monsanto. Thomas agreed to co-ordinate the Chemistry efforts of the different Manhattan Project laboratories, but he did not wish to move <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico.</b> Despite his youth, Kennedy officially became CM Division leader in April 1944.|$|E

5|$|The black-throated gray warbler breeds {{in western}} North America, its range {{extending}} from southwestern British Columbia along the Pacific coast to northern Baja California, and east <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> and southern Montana. It winters mostly in Mexico, from southern Baja California to Oaxaca state. It has spread into parts of Wyoming and Montana only recently, as Juniperus osteosperma {{has expanded its}} range due to a warming climate. Vagrants have been recorded across eastern North America and in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|The grey jay (Perisoreus canadensis), also gray jay, Canada jay, or whisky jack, is a {{passerine}} bird of {{the family}} Corvidae. It is found in boreal forests of North America north to the tree line, and in the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone south <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> and Arizona. A fairly large songbird, the grey jay has pale grey underparts, darker grey upperparts, and a grey-white head with a darker grey nape. It {{is one of three}} members of the genus Perisoreus, a small genus more closely related to the Cyanopica genus of magpies than to other birds known as jays. The grey jay itself has nine recognized subspecies.|$|E

50|$|Highway 550 {{was part}} of the {{original}} 1926 federal highway system. The original highway extended 110 miles (177 km) from Montrose, Colorado at U.S. Highway 50 to U.S. Highway 450 (now U.S. Highway 160) at Durango, Colorado. In 1934, Highway 550 was extended through Farmington <b>to</b> Shiprock, <b>New</b> <b>Mexico.</b> In 1989, the western end of Highway 550 was replaced with U.S. Highway 64 between Farmington and Shiprock. In 1999, Highway 550 was rerouted at Aztec, <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> <b>to</b> replace <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> State Highway 44 <b>to</b> Bernalillo, <b>New</b> <b>Mexico,</b> at which time all of Highway 550 in <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> was upgraded <b>to</b> four lanes.|$|R

5|$|Agnew and Beverly {{moved to}} the Los Alamos Laboratory in March 1943. Agnew, Beverly and Bernard Waldman first went to the University of Illinois, where the men {{disassembled}} the Cockcroft–Walton generator and particle accelerator while Beverly catalogued all the parts. The parts were shipped <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico,</b> where Agnew and Beverly met up with them, and rode the trucks hauling them to the Los Alamos Laboratory. There, Beverly worked a secretary, initially with Robert Oppenheimer and his secretary Priscilla Green. She then became secretary to Robert Bacher, the head of Physics (P) Division, and later the Gadget (G) Division, {{for the rest of}} the war. Agnew's job was to reassemble the accelerator, which was then used for experiments by John Manley's group.|$|E
5|$|In Sandoz's apartment, Mulder and Scully find {{a picture}} of him with Albert Hosteen; they also find Merkmallen's dismembered body in a trash bag. The agents report to Skinner, with Mulder believing that Sandoz is being framed and that the {{artifact}} emits galactic radiation. He also seems to know that someone else is involved on the case, but Skinner remains silent. However, after the agents leave, Skinner hands a video tape of their conversation to Alex Krycek, who later provides it to Barnes. Scully travels <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> and discovers that Hosteen is dying of cancer; Scully runs into Sandoz and corners him. Sandoz claims that Albert was helping him translate the artifacts, which had included passages from the Bible. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to the university to tail Barnes, but is overcome by his headache and passes out in the stairwell.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{producing}} an English-language version of Let the Right One In began in 2007 shortly {{before it was}} released to audiences. In 2008, Hammer Films acquired the rights for the English adaptation and initially offered Tomas Alfredson, {{the director of the}} Swedish film, the opportunity to direct, which he declined. Reeves was then signed to direct and write the screenplay. Reeves made several changes for the English version such as altering the setting from Stockholm <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> and renaming the lead characters. The film's producers stated that their intent was to keep the plot similar to the original, yet make it more accessible to a wider audience. Principal photography began in early November 2009, and concluded in January 2010. The film's budget was estimated to be $20 million.|$|E

In November he accompanied Oppenheimer on a trip <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> on which the Los Alamos Ranch School was selected as the site of the project's weapons research laboratory, which became the Los Alamos Laboratory. With Oppenheimer and John H. Manley, he drew up the specifications for the new laboratory's technical buildings. He recruited personnel for the laboratory, including Richard Feynman and Robert R. Wilson, established the test area known as the Anchor Ranch, and scoured the country for technical equipment from machine tools to a cyclotron.|$|E

5|$|The Oklahoma panhandle's Western edge {{is out of}} {{alignment}} with its Texas border. The Oklahoma/New Mexico border is 2.1 to 2.2 {{miles east of the}} Texas line. The border between Texas and New Mexico was set first {{as a result of a}} survey by Spain in 1819. It was then set along the 103rd Meridian. In the 1890s, when Oklahoma was formally surveyed using more accurate surveying equipment and techniques, it was discovered the Texas line was not set along the 103rd Meridian. Surveying techniques were not as accurate in 1819, and the actual 103rd Meridian was approximately 2.2 miles to the east. It was much easier to leave the mistake than for Texas to cede land <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> to correct the surveying error. The placement of the Oklahoma/New Mexico border represents the true 103rd Meridian.|$|E

5|$|After the 1897 {{baseball}} season, {{he returned}} to his home in Portland, Oregon with his health deteriorating. In December, Parrott traveled <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> in hopes of re-gaining his health. When in New Mexico, he reported that the weather was too cold and that he was planning to move to Arizona where the climate is more mild. On April 14, 1898, while in a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, Parrott died of tuberculosis. Earlier that day, Parrott had telegraphed his father, Thomas H. Parrott, back in Portland alerting him that it was not likely he would live two more days. Upon receiving the telegram, Thomas H. Parrott sent his son, Archie Parrott, on a train to Arizona to be with the dying Jiggs Parrott. However, after the train left the station in Portland, the Parrott family got word that Jiggs Parrott had died. Archie Parrott continued to Arizona to retrieve his brother's remains. His remains were returned on April 23. Parrott's funeral was held on April 25, at his home in East Portland. His pall-bearers were several former teammates from the Portland Willamettes: Joseph Beveridge, Charles Neale, Frank Buchtel, William Kern, Fred Bailey, and John Rankin. According to The Oregonian hundreds attended his funeral and 500 people attended his burial at Lone Fir Cemetery in Portland.|$|E
5|$|The first {{storm of}} the season, Hurricane Adolph became the southernmost-forming east Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone on record after forming at a latitude of 7.1°N. After a slow start, activity {{picked up in}} July, when Hurricane Gil moved through the Hawaiian Islands, resulting in moderate damage. In early August, Hurricane Ismael was responsible for three deaths and $19million (1983USD) in damage. During early September, Hurricanes Kiko and Lorena brought significant damage and seven deaths to southern Mexico. About a month later, Tropical Storm Octave became the worst tropical cyclone on record to affect Arizona. Octave killed 15 people, and caused $500million in damage to Arizona and $12.5million <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico.</b> Later in October, Hurricane Tico was a very intense hurricane {{at the time of}} its landfall and thus left 25,000homeless. Damage throughout the country was estimated at $200million while 135deaths were reported in Mexico. Although most of its impact occurred in Mexico, Tico's remnants brought significant flooding in the Central United States, resulting in six deaths and $42million in damage. A few days later, Hurricane Raymond posed a threat to Hawaii, but did little actual damage. The final storm of the season, Hurricane Winnie, was a rare December cyclone.|$|E
