5|$|These {{operations}} require {{from all}} of us – officers and men – exceptional efforts, sustained day and night, despite a moral tension tested to its limits by the sight of <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> wrought by a pitiless invader. However severe the trial may be, you will come through it gallantly.|$|E
5|$|Whitlam {{travelled}} extensively {{as prime}} minister, {{and was the}} first Australian prime minister to visit China while in office. He was criticised for making this visit, especially after Cyclone Tracy struck Darwin; he interrupted an extensive tour of Europe for 48hours (deemed too brief a period by many) to view <b>the</b> <b>devastation.</b>|$|E
5|$|A new {{government}} center {{was to be}} built on the hills northeast of Manila, or what is now Quezon City. Several government agencies have set up their headquarters in Quezon City but several key government offices still reside in Manila.

5|$|Anne's {{seventeen}} pregnancies by George {{resulted in}} twelve miscarriages or stillbirths, four infant deaths, and a chronically sick son, William, {{who died at}} the age of eleven. Despite the history of their children, George and Anne's marriage was a strong one. George died aged 55 from a recurring and chronic lung disease, much to <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> of his wife, and he was buried in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{childhood}} {{influence was}} Heigo Kurosawa, Akira's older brother by four years. In {{the aftermath of}} the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira to view <b>the</b> <b>devastation.</b> When the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade him to do so, instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{creation}} of Chew Valley Lake and river level controls at Keynsham Lock and weir, Keynsham was prone to flooding. The Great Flood of 1968 inundated {{large parts of the}} town, destroying the town's bridges including the county bridge over the Avon which had stood since medieval times, and private premises on Dapps Hill; <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> was viewed by the Duke of Edinburgh. After the flood the Memorial Park, which had been laid out after World War II was extended.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth and Philip {{were married}} on 20 November 1947 at Westminster Abbey. They {{received}} 2500 wedding gifts {{from around the}} world. Because Britain had not yet completely recovered from <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> of the war, Elizabeth required ration coupons to buy the material for her gown, which was designed by Norman Hartnell. In post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations, including his three surviving sisters, {{to be invited to}} the wedding. The Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII, was not invited either.|$|E
5|$|In 1944 the British Council awarded Roa Bastos a nine-month {{fellowship}} for {{journalism in}} London.

Roa Bastos also broadcast Latin American programs {{at the invitation of}} the BBC and France's Ministry of Information.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th century, {{recurrent}} civil wars, {{attacks from}} Bulgaria and Serbia in the Balkans and <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> caused by ever-increasing Turkish raids hastened {{the collapse of}} the Byzantine state, which would culminate in its final fall to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. Several emperors after Andronikos II also tried to re-build a fleet, especially in order to secure the security and hence the independence of Constantinople itself from the interference of the Italian maritime powers, but their efforts produced only short-term results.|$|E

5|$|Kentucky Extension specialists suggest {{selecting}} uncommon {{species to}} replace removed ashes in the landscape. Previous generations created monocultures by planting ash trees in an overabundance, {{a factor in}} the extent of <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> caused by the emerald ash borer.

University of Kentucky scientists suggest choosing monotypic species such as the pawpaw, yellowwood, Franklin tree, Kentucky coffeetree, Osage orange, sourwood, and baldcypress.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{warn that}} climate change could {{increase}} the intensity of typhoons as climate change projections show that the difference in temperature between the ocean – the heat source for cyclones – and the storm tops – the cold parts of cyclones – are likely to increase. Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of high-intensity storms in selected ocean basins. While the effect changing climate is having on tropical storms remains largely unresolved scientists and president of Vanuatu Baldwin Lonsdale say <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> caused by Pam, was aggravated by climate change.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{at the end}} of the 14th century, {{no doubt}} on account of <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> caused mid-century by the Black Death, there was a general shift towards less {{expensive}} techniques. Many things which would have earlier been completely forbidden by the guilds were now commonplace (using low quality wool, carding, etc.). In the silk industry, the use of water-powered mills grew, and by the 15th century, the loom designed by Jean le Calabrais saw nearly universal use.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>devastations</b> of Hurricane Hugo and the {{eruption}} of the Soufrière Hills volcano, the Montserratian economy has been effectively halted.

5|$|The National Guard {{was called}} into Enterprise in the {{aftermath}} of the tornado. Governor Bob Riley mobilized about 100 troops and placed more on standby. A dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed on the community after the tornado strike. On the morning of March3, President George W. Bush visited the community and declared Coffee County a disaster area. He went into the school and also took an aerial view of <b>the</b> <b>devastation.</b> The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was also called in to provide additional assistance.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>devastation</b> in Dobrudzha at {{the hands}} of the Magyars {{indicated}} how vulnerable Bulgaria was to attacks from the north under the influence of the Byzantine diplomacy. That experience paid off well in 917, when Simeon managed to counter the Byzantine efforts to ally with the Serbs or the Pechenegs, and forced them to fight alone in the battle of Achelous, where the Byzantines were soundly defeated in one of the biggest disasters in Byzantine history.|$|E
5|$|These {{developments}} {{placed the}} regency in considerable difficulties. In spite of Apokaukos' adroit {{management of the}} state's finances, <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> caused by the prolonged wars had emptied the treasury. In August 1343, Empress Anna was forced to pawn the crown jewels to Venice for 30,000 ducats. In addition, Turkish ravages in Thrace led to a scarcity of food in Constantinople. Hoping for Western aid, Anna appealed to the Pope, promising the submission of herself, John V, Apokaukos and even the Patriarch to his authority, and began persecuting the pro-Kantakouzenists and anti-Western Palamists.|$|E
