5|$|For the {{majority}} of its history the area now recognised as the Rhondda Valley was an exclusively Welsh speaking area. It was only in the early 20th century that English began to supplant Welsh as the first language of social intercourse. In 1803, English historian Benjamin Heath Malkin mentioned while travelling through Ystradyfodwg, that he had only met one person with whom he could talk, and then {{with the help of an}} interpreter. This situation was repeated with John George Wood, who on his visit to the area complained of the awkwardness of understanding the particular dialects and idioms used by the native speakers, which were on times difficult for other Welsh speakers <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> <b>This</b> dialect was once called 'tafodiaith gwŷr y Gloran' ('the dialect of the men of Gloran').|$|E
5|$|To {{locate a}} second {{point on the}} lines L1, L2 and L3, Gergonne noted a {{reciprocal}} relationship between those lines and the radical axis R of the solution circles, CA and CB. <b>To</b> <b>understand</b> <b>this</b> reciprocal relationship, consider the two tangent lines to the circle C1 drawn at its tangent points A1 and B1 with the solution circles; the intersection of these tangent lines is the pole point of L1 in C1. Since the distances from that pole point to the tangent points A1 and B1 are equal, this pole point must also lie on the radical axis R of the solution circles, by definition (Figure9). The relationship between pole points and their polar lines is reciprocal; if the pole of L1 in C1 lies on R, the pole of R in C1 must conversely lie on L1. Thus, if we can construct R, we can find its pole P1 in C1, giving the needed second point on L1 (Figure10).|$|E

25|$|<b>To</b> <b>understand</b> <b>this</b> notion better, {{it helps}} to {{consider}} a relation as mapping every element x∈X to a set xR = { y∈Y | xRy }.

25|$|One way <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>this</b> {{formula is}} to use the fact that the {{determinant}} of two vectors on the plane will give the area of the parallelogram they form.

25|$|However, the {{universe}} could be finite, even if its curvature is flat.

25|$|Thus the Chow {{group of}} an {{elliptic}} curve X {{is closely related}} to the group X(k) of k-rational points of X.

When k is the complex numbers, the example of an elliptic curve shows that Chow groups can be uncountable abelian groups.|$|E

25|$|One {{challenge}} studying sleep {{evolution is}} that adequate sleep information is known only for two phyla of animals- chordata and arthropoda.

25|$|Both in vivo {{study and}} {{modelling}} are necessary tools <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>this</b> complex process. Vascular remodelling is pertinent to wound healing and proper integration of tissue grafts and organ donations.

25|$|The partitive–indefinite pro-clitic re is {{used when}} the NP {{refers to a}} new, {{non-specific}} instance of a notion. In order <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>this</b> concept, compare the English sentences 'I ate a banana ' with 'I want to eat a banana '. Besides being indefinite in both cases, in the first sentence a banana is specific, because it refers to a specific banana; in the second sentence a banana is non-specific, because it can refer to any banana, not one in particular. Although this semantic difference is not grammaticalized in English, it is in Araki, using re as a marker for non-specific indefinite reference.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{respiration}} and its rate across ecosystems {{is extremely}} important <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> <b>This</b> is because soil respiration plays {{a large role in}} global carbon cycling as well as other nutrient cycles. The respiration of plant structures releases not only CO2 but also other nutrients in those structures, such as nitrogen. Soil respiration is also associated with positive feedbacks with global climate change. Positive feedbacks are when a change in a system produces response in the same direction of the change. Therefore, soil respiration rates can be effected by climate change and then respond by enhancing climate change.|$|E

To keep growing, the Taiwanese economy must abandon its workforce intensive industries, which cannot compete with China, Vietnam or other sub-developed countries, and keep innovating and investing in information technology. Since the 1990s, Taiwanese companies have been permitted to invest in China, {{and a growing number of}} Taiwanese businessmen are demanding easier communications between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.|$|E
25|$|A {{modeling}} {{system based on}} {{a better understanding of}} the termination targeting of lightning, called the Rolling Sphere Method, was developed by Dr Tibor Horváth. It has become the standard by which traditional Franklin Rod systems are installed. <b>To</b> <b>understand</b> <b>this</b> requires knowledge of how lightning 'moves'. As the step leader of a lightning bolt jumps toward the ground, it steps toward the grounded objects nearest its path. The maximum distance that each step may travel is called the critical distance and is proportional to the electric current. Objects are likely to be struck if they are nearer to the leader than this critical distance. It is standard practice to approximate the sphere's radius as 46m near the ground.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Edward Witten {{discovered}} that most theories of quantum gravity could not accommodate chiral fermions like the neutrino. This led him, {{in collaboration with}} Luis Álvarez-Gaumé, to study violations of the conservation laws in gravity theories with anomalies, concluding that type I string theories were inconsistent. Green and Schwarz discovered {{a contribution to the}} anomaly that Witten and Alvarez-Gaumé had missed, which restricted the gauge group of the type I string theory to be SO(32). In coming <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>this</b> calculation, Edward Witten became convinced that string theory was truly a consistent theory of gravity, and he became a high-profile advocate. Following Witten's lead, between 1984 and 1986, hundreds of physicists started to work in this field, and this is sometimes called the first superstring revolution.|$|E
