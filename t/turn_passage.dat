5000|$|The A.V. Clubs {{reviewer}} writes: [...] "There's certainly nothing comforting about Passage, which steeps its {{characters in}} death {{of all kinds}} — swift and sudden, prolonged and painful. Willis' satirical flair originally has Landry sic and Wright running around like The Three Stooges, juggling impossible schedules in an impossible environment and careening amidst exaggeratedly colorful characters in every chapter. A mid-book twist, however, takes the story into darker and more memorable territory, helping <b>turn</b> <b>Passage</b> into a complex, finely crafted, haunting story that makes {{the light at the}} end of the tunnel impossible to take lightly." ...|$|E

5000|$|Christmas Eve Reading - On Christmas Eve {{just before}} midnight, the {{characters}} would take <b>turns</b> reading <b>passages</b> from [...] "Twas the Night Before Christmas". This was adopted because the club would close early {{due to the}} holiday, {{and there was no}} performance of the Rhythm Ritual or Hoopla that evening.|$|R

60|$|Reaching the {{entrance}} {{they began to}} mount the stone stairs. They went up ten stairs and then down five stairs, following a passage cut from the rock. The stairs were just wide enough for the two girls to walk abreast, arm in arm. At {{the bottom of the}} five stairs the <b>passage</b> <b>turned</b> to the right, and they ascended ten more stairs, only to find {{at the top of the}} flight five stairs leading straight down again. Again the <b>passage</b> <b>turned</b> abruptly, this time to the left, and ten more stairs led upward.|$|R
60|$|He {{descended the}} gorge {{on the other}} side. The slope was gradual, the space narrow, the course {{straight}} for many rods. A gloom hung between the up-sweeping walls. In a <b>turn</b> the <b>passage</b> narrowed to scarce a dozen feet, and here was darkness of night. But light shone ahead; another abrupt turn brought day again, and then wide open space.|$|R
60|$|Yet a few seconds, and {{the figure}} of a tall woman, holding aslant a heavy-plated drawing-room candlestick, {{appeared}} at the <b>turning</b> of the <b>passage</b> that led to the broader entrance.|$|R

50|$|Sterne was no {{friend of}} gravitas, a quality which excited his disgust. Tristram Shandy gives a ludicrous <b>turn</b> to solemn <b>passages</b> from {{respected}} authors that it incorporates, {{as well as}} to the Consolatio literary genre.|$|R

In <b>turn,</b> the <b>passages</b> that Huangfu Mi (215-282) attributed to the Jiujuan in his AB Canon of Acupuncture and Moxibustion (Zhenjiu jiayi jing 鍼灸甲乙經) all have equivalents in the received edition of the Lingshu.|$|R
60|$|My {{mistress}} {{followed him}} into the <b>passage,</b> <b>turning,</b> however, in the opposite direction to that taken by the little parson, in order to reach the staircase that led to her own room. I went out next, leaving Mr. James Smith alone.|$|R

60|$|Babalatchi and Mrs. Almayer {{had listened}} curiously, their bodies bent and their ears <b>turned</b> towards the <b>passage.</b> At every louder shout they nodded {{at each other}} with a ridiculous {{affectation}} of scandalised propriety, and they remained in the same attitude for some time after the noise had ceased.|$|R
5000|$|The {{question}} <b>turns</b> on <b>passages</b> in {{the poem}} (1226-1280; cf. 1446-1450) that describe Roman dominance in terms that only fit the situation after the Second Macedonian War. Cassandra prophesies that her Trojan ancestors' descendants [...] "shall with their spears win the foremost crown of glory, obtaining the sceptre and monarchy of earth and sea" [...] and elaborates with allusions to the course of historical events. Some scholars, such as Stephanie West, regard these passages as interpolations and defend the attribution of {{the bulk of the}} poem to Lycophron the tragic poet.|$|R
50|$|Municipal {{government}} of Savski Venac began <b>turning</b> the underground <b>passage</b> into an exhibition gallery. For now, it includes 20 exhibition panels {{set for the}} official Belgrade holiday, Belgrade Days, in April 2008, but soon individual panel cameras and sound system with loudspeakers for 24-hour-a-day classical music play will be also installed.|$|R

60|$|They {{crossed the}} broader {{part of the}} entrance-hall, and <b>turned</b> up the <b>passage</b> {{which led to the}} garden.

60|$|For {{fifteen minutes}} they marched along {{the face of}} the wall before they {{discovered}} a means of ingress. Then they came to a narrow cleft about twenty inches wide.

60|$|He {{withdrew his}} hand from her clasp and <b>turned</b> into the <b>passage</b> again. The girl listened to his {{footsteps}} as he approached her mother's bedchamber, paused a moment, and then softly {{opened the door and}} entered. Silence again pervaded the reception room. The clock resumed its loud ticking. Miss Gorham raised her book. Alora went back to her chair, trembling.|$|R
60|$|The passage was now quite dark, {{for they}} were {{in the heart of the}} {{mountain}} and all daylight had been shut out by the <b>turns</b> of the <b>passage.</b> However, Ozma drew her silver wand from her bosom and the great jewel at its end gave out a lustrous, green-tinted light which lighted the place well enough for them to see their way plainly.|$|R

50|$|Amir Khusrow (1253-1325 CE) {{introduced}} {{the notion that}} any of the several meanings of a word, or phrase, might be equally true and intended, creating a multilayered text. Discerning the various layers of meanings would be a challenge to the reader, who has to focus on and keep <b>turning</b> over the <b>passage</b> in his mind, applying his erudition and imagination to perceive alternative meanings.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} {{originally}} a Neolithic settlement but was abandoned by its occupants, {{perhaps because it}} was a temporary site serving the construction project or due to the death of a senior member, and <b>turned</b> into a <b>passage</b> grave. Unlike its more famous neighbours in the Boyne valley, the tomb consists of a single chamber that merges with the entrance passage making it an undifferentiated passage grave.|$|R
60|$|In one {{chamber of}} the Hall, just {{opposite}} a door which opens upon a dusky passage, there is a full-length portrait of a warrior in armour; when, on suddenly <b>turning</b> into the <b>passage,</b> I have caught a sight of the portrait, thrown into strong relief by the dark pannelling against which it hangs, I have more than once been startled, {{as though it were}} a figure advancing towards me.|$|R
60|$|The others joined--even Sir Richard Brandon made {{an attempt}} to sing--as he had done on a {{previous}} occasion, but without much success, musically speaking. Meanwhile, John Seaward <b>turned</b> up the <b>passage</b> from which he had prepared to speak that evening. And so eloquent with nature's simplicity was the missionary, that the party soon forgot all about the Twitters while the comforting Gospel was being urged upon the unhappy creatures around.|$|R
50|$|By 1999 {{three types}} of {{large-scale}} projects are operating: Program (1998) configured a relation to a 'public' by intersecting three public programs (university, national television, and public art), and a TV work offering a recollection of broadcast media pasts that in <b>turn</b> generates <b>passages</b> through a contemporary character of transitional, post-1989 Germany.

50|$|For {{a number}} of years circa the 1990s The Eye of Argon was read aloud, usually as charity events, at several West Coast U.S. Science fiction {{conventions}} (such as OryCon and LosCon) as well as Northeast U.S. conventions such as 5Con. A panel of volunteers would take <b>turns</b> reading <b>passages,</b> and the audience would bid to stop that passage or continue (for some set number of minutes, or paragraphs after each successful bid). At some of these events some members of the audience improvisationally got up to act out the scenes being read, as mime. All proceeds from these were then given to various charities. Some of these events were spontaneous, others were officially scheduled. Usually they were held late at night or in the wee hours.|$|R
60|$|There {{were men}} in the gang quite as bold, if not as strong, as Samson. One of these, a very tall and {{powerful}} negro, on drawing near {{to the place where}} Marizano stood superintending the <b>passage,</b> <b>turned</b> suddenly aside, and, although coupled by the neck to a fellow-slave, and securely bound at the wrists with a cord, which was evidently cutting into his swelled flesh, made a desperate kick at the half-caste leader.|$|R
50|$|The {{south shore}} of Seaforth Channel {{is not as}} {{irregular}} as the north side. After Athlone, Dufferin, Horsfall and Campbell islands the channel makes a sharp <b>turn</b> to the <b>passage</b> between Campbell Island and Denny Island. It extends along Denny Island to the junction with Lama Passage between Hunter Island and Denny Island. The tug/barge that ran aground on Edge Reef off Athlone Island {{at the entrance to}} the Seaforth Channel in October 2016 was heading south.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, she had {{followed}} him. His lordship, {{still in the}} war-horse vein, had made the pace upstairs too hot, and had disappeared {{while she was still}} halfway up. She had arrived at the top {{just in time to see}} him <b>turn</b> down the <b>passage</b> into Sir Thomas's dressing-room. She could not think what his object might be. She knew that Sir Thomas was downstairs, so it could not be from the idea of a chat with him that Spennie was seeking the dressing-room.|$|R
