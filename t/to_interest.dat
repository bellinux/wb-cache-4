He tried <b>to</b> <b>interest</b> {{the governments of the}} United Kingdom and Europe in the idea of a tunnel under the English Channel but this came to nothing.

5|$|Chamberlain {{presented}} his first budget in April 1932. He maintained the severe budget cuts {{that had been}} agreed at {{the inception of the}} National Government. Interest on the war debt was a major cost. Chamberlain reduced the annual interest rate on most of Britain's war debt from 5% to 3.5%. Between 1932 and 1938, Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted <b>to</b> <b>interest</b> on the war debt.|$|E
40|$|Development {{of career}} {{goals that are}} adapted to self and {{opportunities}} is a central component of adolescent career preparation. The present longitudinal study (conducted throughout the eighth grade with three assessment points) investigated how 330 Swiss adolescents simultaneously adapt career goals <b>to</b> <b>interests,</b> scholastic achievement and environmental opportunities. Results demonstrated that students increasingly adapt their goals to the environment. Mean adaptation to environment related positively to degree of adaption <b>to</b> <b>interests</b> and achievement. Increased adaptation to environment over time related to increased adaptation to achievement but to decreased adaptation <b>to</b> <b>interests.</b> Gender, attended school type and nationality moderated adaptation processes. Structurally disadvantaged students (girls, lower requirements school track, immigrant students) reported more conflict in aligning adaptation to environment with adaptation <b>to</b> <b>interests...</b>|$|R

5|$|Development {{began in}} 2010, soon after id Software gave MachineGames the {{rights for the}} franchise. The {{development}} team envisioned Wolfenstein: The New Order as a first-person action-adventure game, taking inspiration from previous games in the series and particularly focusing on the combat and adventure elements. The game attempts to delve into character development of Blazkowicz, unlike its predecessors—a choice from the developers <b>to</b> <b>interest</b> players in the story. They also aimed to portray him in a heroic fashion.|$|E
5|$|In 1566, {{through the}} {{ambassador}} to the Ottoman Empire, Guillaume de Grandchamp de Grantrie, and because of a long-standing Franco-Ottoman alliance, Charles and Catherine proposed to the Ottoman Court a plan to resettle French Huguenots and French and German Lutherans in Ottoman-controlled Moldavia, {{in order to create}} a military colony and a buffer against the Habsburg. This plan also had the added advantage of removing the Huguenots from France, but it failed <b>to</b> <b>interest</b> the Ottomans.|$|E

5|$|Soon after recording, Dolph sent an acetate disc of the {{recordings}} to Columbia {{in an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>interest</b> them in distributing the album, but they declined, as did Atlantic Records and Elektra Records—according to Morrison, Atlantic objected to the references to drugs in Reed's songs while Elektra disliked Cale's viola.

5|$|The {{development}} of the RP-77 began in 1955. Similar in outline to Radioplane's earlier OQ-19, four prototypes of the RP-77 were constructed, two each of the RP-77, powered by a four-cylinder McCulloch piston engine, and of the RP-77A, powered by a six-cylinder Lycoming engine. Results of flight-testing were insufficient <b>to</b> <b>interest</b> the U.S. Army, however in 1957 a proposal for an improved RP-77D, powered by a Boeing 502 turboprop, resulted in a contract {{for the construction of}} 20 aircraft.|$|E

5|$|According to {{a report}} of the trip Armstrong later filed with the Hawaiian government, any {{negotiations}} for Indian contract labor had to be done with the British government in London, so no talks were conducted during their time in India. They arrived in Calcutta on May 28 and visited the Alipore Zoological Gardens. Kalākaua spent one day sitting in the Calcutta courthouse to observe India's legal process. Their trip across the British India subcontinent was a sightseeing excursion during their last days before sailing to the Middle East, and they stopped to tour the Ellora Caves prior to reaching Bombay. The King soon tired of the long journey, and was bored and restless by the time they arrived at Bombay, where they remained until the departure of their steamship on June 7. There was more in Bombay <b>to</b> <b>interest</b> him: a shopping trip, the Arab Stallion Stables, the Parsi Towers of Silence, and a visit from businessman Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy.|$|E

McCartney and Asher later attempted to mend their relationship, but finally broke up in July1968. Asher has consistently refused to publicly discuss {{that part of her}} life. Schwartz, a twenty three year old New York scriptwriter, had travelled to London trying <b>to</b> <b>interest</b> Apple Corps in a film script. Schwartz was then asked by McCartney to move into his Cavendish Avenue house, and was given a job working for Derek Taylor at Apple, which was then based in Wigmore Street, London. She attended many sessions during the recording of the White Album, and was living with McCartney when Lennon and Yoko Ono were also invited to live there. Shortly after, Schwartz sold the story of her time at Cavendish Avenue to Rolling Stone magazine.|$|E

He made his debut two days later in a 3–0 home defeat to Crystal Palace. He scored just two goals in the remainder of the season, the first against Grimsby Town on 24 February 2001, and the second against Sheffield United on 10 March.|$|E

Roda went on to beat the Slovenian side 5–2 on aggregate, but lost to Benfica in the second round. Solid performances at both international and club level led <b>to</b> <b>interest</b> from Dutch side Ajax, as Louis van Gaal was looking to replace Babangida's compatriot Finidi George, who had recently departed to Real Betis.|$|E
