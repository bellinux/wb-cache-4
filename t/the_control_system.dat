5|$|As the TR-1 engines {{originally}} {{intended for the}} Su-9 were not yet ready for flight testing in late 1945, Pavel Sukhoi suggested substituting a pair of Jumo 004 engines and this was approved on 15 December. The full-scale mockup {{was found to be}} acceptable on 16 February 1946 and the Council of People's Commissars issued an order on 26 February that the manufacturer's flight testing was to begin on 1 November. This goal was not met because the OKB was heavily committed to other projects like the trainer version of the Tupolev Tu-2 bomber, inexperience with JATO units, and late delivery of RD-10 engines. The first prototype was completed in mid-October and made its first flight on 13 November. The test pilots found the aircraft easy to fly, but the control forces were very high at speed and it lacked enough directional stability. Enlarging the vertical stabilizer cured this last problem and hydraulic boosters were fitted for <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beat 'em ups often {{allow the}} player {{to choose between}} a {{selection}} of protagonists—each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and set of moves. Attacks can include rapid combinations of basic attacks (combos) as well as jumping and grappling attacks.

5|$|The idea of {{a control}} system was {{inspired}} by Vladimir Lenin in The State and Revolution. Lenin argued that every communist vanguard party, at all levels, needed a system to supervise party-official elections, dismissals and performance. His writings led {{to the establishment of}} the Soviet Central Control Commission; <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> and the Communist Party of China (CPC) structure were imported to China. The importance of discipline and supervision was emphasised since the CPC's founding. The 2nd National Congress amended the party constitution, devoting a chapter to party discipline. However, no institution was established to safeguard party norms or supervise cadre behaviour. Until the establishment of the Central Control Commission (CCC) at the 5th National Congress in 1927, local party committees were responsible for supervising members and control commissions were established at the central and provincial level.|$|E
5|$|The {{exposition}} to Night Trap {{is presented}} to the player by Lt. Simms of the Sega Control Attack Team (S.C.A.T.) {{at the start of}} the game. He explains that the team was alerted to the disappearance of five teenage girls who were last seen at the Martin winery estate. The Martin family consists of Victor Martin, his wife Sheila, their children Jeff and Sarah, and cousin Tony. The missing girls were reportedly invited to stay for the night. Police questioned the Martin family, but they claimed the girls had left safely, and they refused to let the police search the property. The police then handed over the case to S.C.A.T., which investigated the house and discovered a series of traps, security cameras, and an operational unit in the basement to control the apparatus. The S.C.A.T. agents spliced an override cable onto <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> and connected it to a control panel in the back hallway of the house. The player is given the role of an internal S.C.A.T. operative charged with controlling the traps and cameras from this back hallway.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes the time-delayed cubic {{velocity}} feedback control strategy {{to improve the}} isolation performance of High-Static-Low-Dynamic-Stiffness (HSLDS) vibration isolator. Firstly, the primary resonance of <b>the</b> <b>controlled</b> HSLDS vibration isolator is obtained by using multiple scales method. The equivalent damping ratio and equivalent resonance frequency are defined to {{study the effects of}} feedback gain and time delay on the primary resonance. The jump phenomenon analysis of <b>the</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>system</b> without and with time delay is investigated by using Sylvester resultant method and optimization method, respectively. The stability analysis of <b>the</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>system</b> is also considered. Then, the 1 / 3 subharmonic resonance of <b>the</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>system</b> is studied by using multiple scales method. The effects of feedback gain and time delay on the 1 / 3 subharmonic resonance are also presented. Finally, force transmissibility is proposed to evaluate the performance of <b>the</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>system</b> and compared with an equivalent linear passive vibration isolator. The results show that the vibration amplitude of <b>the</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>system</b> around <b>the</b> resonance frequency region decreases and the isolation frequency band is larger compared to the equivalent one. A better isolation performance in the high frequency band can be achieved compared to the passive HSLDS vibration isolator...|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> {{performance}} {{can be improved}} by combining the feedback (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with feed-forward (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or error remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open loop control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can {{be based on the}} setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.|$|E
