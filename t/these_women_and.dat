25|$|However, gender {{identity}} {{of girls and}} women with CAH is nearly always unequivocally female. Sexual orientation is more mixed, though the majority are heterosexual.

25|$|In {{the past}} most agunah cases {{were due to}} a husband dying without leaving clear {{evidence}} of his demise, or becoming mentally ill (insane).

In response agunah groups have organized to support <b>these</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> try to find a solution to this problem. Various remedies have been proposed, but as yet, no one solution has common acceptance. Nevertheless, the Prenuptial Agreement for the Prevention of Get-Refusal is one remedy which is in use in Modern Orthodox Jewish communities worldwide and is accepted by moderate halakhic authorities.|$|E
25|$|An area Farnsworth tried but {{ultimately}} failed to develop was {{the recruitment of}} women. His desire was for {{a branch of the}} Klan to stem the growth of Catholics in public education and strengthen moralistic teachings in the home. For him women were the answer. Mrs. Gertrude Witham was promoted to Major Kleagle of the Maine Women of the KKK. However Farnsworth and Witham failed in effectively recruiting new women members. It also became apparent as timed passed that some of the female Klan were foreign-born (i.e. Canadian). This resulted in the dismissal of <b>these</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> their suing of the Klan to recover their initiation fees and dues. On top of this Farnsworth continued to charge $10 for initiation fees instead of the agreed-upon fee by the national women’s organization of $5. These efforts outside of the guidelines of the national Klan, along with other perceived misconduct, would eventually lead to Farnsworth’s resignation as King Kleagle of Maine.|$|E

[...] Betsey Sharkey, of the Los Angeles Times describes the film as being a [...] "rough-cut diamond... rare blend of pure entertainment and dark social commentary, it is a shockingly raw, surprisingly irreverent and absolutely unforgettable story." [...] Claudia Puig, of USA Today says that while there are [...] "melodramatic moments" [...] in the film, the cast gives [...] "remarkable performances" [...] to show the audiences the film's [...] "inspiring message."

[...] "Golden Gate Jumpers" [...] {{is about a}} woman who goes to the Golden Gate Bridge and contemplates taking her life away. The tracks [...] "Avalanche in B" [...] and [...] "I've Seen Enough" [...] were originally conceived by the band as one-long track but instead cut into two songs. The former uses snow as a metaphor for how bleak and empty life is when it is coming straight towards you. The latter was created during a jam session in which the band played one continuous chord progression that stuck with them throughout the session. [...] "Every Man I Fall For" [...] is about a woman's perspective on relationships. Inspired by his own mother's relationship with men, Willett saw something he could craft from that emotion, saying that it stuck with him as having importance [...] "because it was something I always saw in relationships; like my mom being a single mother and seeing how men treat <b>these</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> how they operate in relationships." ...|$|E

2500|$|Women with an {{inherited}} mutation in the DNA repair gene BRCA1 undergo menopause prematurely, suggesting that naturally occurring DNA damages in oocytes are repaired less efficiently in <b>these</b> <b>women,</b> <b>and</b> this inefficiency leads to early reproductive failure.

2500|$|The {{maternal}} feminism ideology, {{with its}} assumption that all women had common interests, prompted many {{women of the}} upper and middle classes {{to look for ways}} to help poorer women through clubs, unions, settlement houses and so on. Women of the elite such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815–1902) of America and Marguerite Durand (1864–1936) of France felt that with their better education and broader experience they had a natural duty to lead.
