5|$|Unlike in New Spain and Central America, in South America {{independence}} was {{spurred by the}} pro-independence fighters who had held out for <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>half</b> decade. José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar inadvertently led a continent-wide pincer movement from southern and northern South America that liberated most of the Spanish American nations on that continent. After securing the independence of Chile in 1818, San Martín concentrated on building a naval fleet in the Pacific to counter Spanish control of those waters and reach the royalist stronghold of Lima. By mid-1820 San Martín had assembled a fleet of eight warships and sixteen transport ships {{under the command of}} Admiral Cochrane. The fleet set sail from Valparaíso to Paracas in southern Peru. On September 7, the army landed at Paracas and successfully took Pisco. After this, San Martín, waiting for a generalized Peruvian revolt, chose to avoid direct military confrontation. San Martín hoped that his presence would initiate an authentic Peruvian revolt against Spanish rule, believing that otherwise any liberation would be ephemeral. In the meantime, San Martín engaged in diplomacy with Viceroy Joaquín de la Pezuela, who was under orders from the constitutional government to negotiate {{on the basis of the}} 1812 Constitution and to maintain the unity of the Spanish Monarchy. However, these efforts proved fruitless, since independence and unity of the monarchy could not be reconciled, so the army sailed in late October to a better strategic position in Huacho, in northern Peru. During the next few months, successful land and naval campaigns against the royalists secured the new foothold, and it was at Huacho that San Martín learned that Guayaquil (in Ecuador) had declared independence on October 9.|$|E

25|$|The {{historic}} {{decline in}} union membership over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>half</b> century {{has been accompanied}} by a growing disparity between public sector and private sector union membership percentages. The three most significant labor groupings in the Democratic coalition today are the AFL-CIO and Change to Win labor federations, as well as the National Education Association, a large, unaffiliated teachers' union. Both the AFL-CIO and Change to Win have identified their top legislative priority for 2007 as passage of the Employee Free Choice Act. Other important issues for labor unions include supporting industrial policy (including protectionism) that sustains unionized manufacturing jobs, raising the minimum wage and promoting broad social programs such as Social Security and universal health care.|$|E
25|$|Measures {{of general}} {{intelligence}} also remain controversial.

Although IQ tests have changed substantially over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>half</b> century, and many {{objections to the}} early tests have been addressed by 'culture neutral' tests (such as the Raven test), IQ testing remains controversial. Regardless of the tests used to identify children for gifted programs, many {{school districts in the}} United States still have disproportionately more White and Asian American students enrolled in their gifted programs, while Hispanic and African American students are usually underrepresented. However, research shows that this may be not be a fault of tests, but rather a result of the achievement gap in the United States.|$|E

Still, New Zealand drew the series, after Cameron took the final wicket. His match bowling figures then read 28.5–7–94–2, but with the final ball of the over he had South Africa's number 11 Harry Bromfield caught.

25|$|In this model, {{the factor}} driving female {{strategies}} {{is the high}} cost to females of increasingly large-brained offspring, requiring increased investment from males. As females of Homo heidelbergensis, the ancestor of Neanderthals and modern humans, came under increasing selection pressure for larger brain size within <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>half</b> million years, they needed more energy in support. This meant greater productivity by males as hunters. However, in the Darwinian world of primate sexual competition, males may {{be more interested in}} finding new fertile females than in supplying the needs of breast-feeding mothers and their infants. Women, unlike chimpanzees, do not show their fertile time. But females cannot easily disguise menstruation. Menstrual periods mark out very clearly which females are coming close to fertility among other females who are pregnant and lactating. Dominant males could therefore target the cycling females and neglect those most in need of support.|$|E
25|$|Numerous recent {{publications}} {{have provided}} {{evidence suggesting that}} increased aerobic exercise for children suffering with ataxic cerebral palsy can improve physiological outcomes. More research is being conducted {{to better understand the}} specific mechanisms that may be responsible for this observation. Over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>half</b> century, a significant amount of research has been focused on the use of stereotaxically placed lesions as a potential treatment method for ataxic cerebral palsy (the method had shown significant improvements in treating Parkinson's disease). Many studies suggested that lesions of the dentate nucleus produced an apparent reduction of symptoms, however the success of these studies did not attain the same level of success that was found when using the method to treat Parkinson’s disease. With the improvement of brain imaging techniques in recent time, it may be possible in the future to utilize these techniques to identify specific sites of imbalance within the brain which could be treated with stereotaxically placed electrodes.|$|E
25|$|During {{their years}} of residence, the Mosers {{collected}} extensive lexical and cultural information, {{much of which}} would be published later in various books and articles. Recorded legends and history were published in the Seri language, and some appear in later collections in English and Spanish.

Felger) in 1985 (which has been hailed as a modern classic), and a major dictionary in 2005, thirty years after Edward’s death, but based largely on work that he and Roberto Herrera Marcos (a.k.a. Roberto Herrera Thomson) had done. What is known today about Seri history and culture, including the so-called “band” structure of this group, is the result of work that the Mosers and Herrera did. Even work that does not bear either of their names as authors, such as the article in the journal Science about hibernating sea turtles, the book about the San Esteban people, and the 2005 dictionary, as well as most work on the Seri language and culture during <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>half</b> century) is part of their legacy.|$|E
