Frederick and his surviving army were {{out of range of}} the Austrian army by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> reorganized. Hans Joachim von Zieten and Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, who also had remained alert all night, organized a rear guard action that prevented the Austrians from falling upon the retreating Prussians. This discouraged even the most determined Austrians; the Croats and irregulars contented themselves with pillaging the village and the Prussian bodies.|$|E

5|$|Bradman {{thought his}} faster bowlers could not extract much bounce {{from the surface}} and soon removed the short leg fielder, and pursued a 63 {{off-side}} field with three slips and a deep point, trying to encourage the English openers {{to cut through the}} vacant area between the slips and extra cover. However, they declined Bradman's incentive and decided to bat in a low-risk manner, favouring straight-batted shots. After 80 minutes of batting, England's openers reached 50, the first <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> put on a half-century in the series. Hutton and Washbrook appeared set for the long haul, and did not react to the applause. They continued on cautiously, and persisted in eschewing the cross-batted cut and pull shots and relying on the safe accumulation of singles.|$|E
