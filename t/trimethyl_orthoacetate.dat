50|$|There {{are many}} stable organic {{compounds}} with the trivalent moiety H3C-C(-O-)3, which are formally esters of orthoacetic acid and therefore called orthoacetates. They include <b>trimethyl</b> <b>orthoacetate</b> and triethyl orthoacetate, which are commercially available.|$|E
40|$|Viscous poly(ortho-ester) s (POE), {{synthesised}} by a transesterification reaction {{between a}} substituted orthoacetate and a triol {{have been shown}} to be bioerodible polymers and are currently under investigation as a drug carrier material. Main efforts of the polymer development so far have been focused on a polymer prepared of <b>trimethyl</b> <b>orthoacetate</b> and 1, 2, 6 -hexanetriol. The present investigation describes the synthesis and characterisation of an analog polymer. By replacing the 1, 2, 6 -hexanetriol with 1, 2, 10 -decanetriol, a higher molecular weight aliphatic triol, the physio-chemical characteristics of the polymer can be changed. The new POE, prepared by a transesterification reaction of <b>trimethyl</b> <b>orthoacetate</b> and 1, 2, 10 -decanetriol is less viscous and more hydrophobic. Due to the decreased viscosity the polymer is easier to use for injectable applications and due to the increased hydrophobicity, the release rate of the chosen compound, the water-soluble 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) is slowed down, compared to the POE described earlier...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{analytical}} method {{was developed to}} measure concentrations of glufosinate ammonium and its metabolites, 3 -methylphosphinico-propionic acid (MPP) and 2 -methylphosphinico-acetic acid (MPA), in field soil samples. To determine the minimum quantification limit, samples were spiked at different levels (0. 1, 0. 5, and 1. 0 [*]mg/kg). Soil samples were extracted with ammonium hydroxide solution 5 % (v/v), concentrated, and reacted with <b>trimethyl</b> <b>orthoacetate</b> (TMOA) {{in the presence of}} acetic acid for derivatization. The derivatives were quantified by gas chromatography (GC) using a flame photometric detector (FPD). The linear correlation coefficients of glufosinate ammonium, MPP, and MPA in soil were 0. 991, 0. 999, and 0. 999, respectively. The recoveries of this method for glufosinate ammonium, MPP, and MPA in soil were 77. 2 – 95. 5 %, 98. 3 – 100. 3 %, and 99. 3 – 99. 6 % with relative standard deviations (RSD) of 1. 8 – 4. 1 %, 0. 4 – 1. 4 %, and 1. 3 – 2. 0 %, respectively. Glufosinate ammonium dissipated rapidly in soil to MPA in hours and gradually degraded to MPP. The half-life of glufosinate ammonium degradation in soil was 2. 30 – 2. 93 days in an open field. In soil samples stored at − 20 °C glufosinate ammonium was stable for two months. The results of this study should provide guidance for the safe application of the herbicide glufosinate ammonium to agricultural products and the environment...|$|E
