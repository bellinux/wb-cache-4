[...] While the 87/0s were fitted with a traditional <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> transformer and rectifiers, 87101 had a new thyristor power control system, and spent over a year on test before entering service in 1976. The locomotive, named Stephenson after transfer of the name from 87001, worked the same services as the standard locomotives for many years, until British Rail was sectorised in the 1980s.|$|E

50|$|A {{mechanical}} <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> physically {{makes the}} new connection before releasing the old using multiple tap selector switches but avoids creating high circulating currents {{by using a}} diverter switch to temporarily place a large diverter impedance in series with the short-circuited turns. This technique overcomes the problems with open or short circuit taps. In a resistance type <b>tap</b> <b>changer,</b> the changeover must be made rapidly to avoid overheating of the diverter. A reactance type <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> uses a dedicated preventive autotransformer winding to function as the diverter impedance, and a reactance type <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> is usually designed to sustain off-tap loading indefinitely.|$|E

50|$|If {{only one}} <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> is required, {{manually}} operated tap points are usually {{made on the}} high voltage (primary) or lower current winding of the transformer to minimize the current handling requirements of the contacts. However, a transformer may include a <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> on each winding if there are advantages to do so. For example, in power distribution networks, a large step-down transformer may have an off-load <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> on the primary winding and an on load automatic <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> on the secondary winding or windings. The high voltage tap is set to match long term system profile on the high voltage network (typically supply voltage averages) and is rarely changed. The low voltage tap may be requested to change positions multiple times each day, without interrupting the power delivery, to follow loading conditions on the low-voltage (secondary winding) network.|$|E

50|$|No load {{tap changers}} are also {{employed}} in high voltage transformers {{in which the}} system includes a no load <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> on the primary winding to accommodate system variations within a narrow band around the nominal rating. In such systems, the <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> will often be set just once, {{at the time of}} installation, although it may be changed later during a scheduled outage to accommodate a long-term change in the system voltage profile.|$|E
50|$|Thyristor-assisted <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> use {{thyristors}} to {{take the}} on load current while the main contacts change over from one tap to the next.

40|$|The latest {{distribution}} {{management systems}} tend to incorporate optimization functions for the short-term scheduling {{of the various}} energy and control resources available in the network (e. g., embedded generators, reactive power compensators and transformers equipped with on-load <b>tap</b> <b>changers).</b> The short-term scheduling procedure adopted in the paper is composed by two stages: a day-ahead scheduler for the optimization of distributed resources production during the following day, an intra-day scheduler that every 15 minutes adjusts the scheduling {{in order to take}} into account the operation requirements and constraints of the distribution network. The intra-day scheduler solves a non-linear multi-objective optimization problem by iteratively applying a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) algorithm. The linearization of the optimization function and the constraints is achieved by the use of sensitivity coefficients obtained from the results of a threephase power flow calculation.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{various aspects of}} coordinated voltage control in {{electric}} power systems. It consists of an introduction and six papers. The introduction contains {{a summary of the}} thesis and tutorials on voltage control and the search methods that have been applied. The first part deals with the coordination of cascaded <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> in radial distribution feeders. Poor coordination causes unnecessary operations of the <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> and consequently unnecessary wear as well as poor voltage quality. A tuning rule for the conventional (local) controllers as well as two new (centralized) schemes are proposed: firstly, an optimal controller based on on-line optimization and secondly, a rule based controller based on a fuzzy inference system. Results from simulations based on load patterns recorded during different seasons indicate that when tuned according to our recommendation, <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> perform some 10 % fewer operations compared to when the present tuning is in use. The additional reductions with the fuzzy-rule based and optimal controllers are some 36 % and 45 %, respectively. A prototype of the fuzzy-rule based controller has been installed and successfully tested in a distribution feeder in the south of Sweden. The prototype was also used to validate the simulation results presented in the papers. Another control interaction problem studied is a phenomenon of limit cycles due to load-tap changer interaction. The role of the OLTC deadband in creating a limit cycle phenomenon is addressed. Analytical insights into the behaviour of power systems with continuous and discrete tap models are given using eigenvalue analysis, the describing function method and time simulation. The conditions for occurrence of limit cycles and the identification of key parameters inf [...] ...|$|R
