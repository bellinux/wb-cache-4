Realizing the danger, {{he is about to}} head back when a walker attacks him. The group races towards his screams, and Daryl quickly dispatches the walker; Carl realizes it is the walker he found in the swamp. Hershel finds Dale's injures are too severe and he will not survive. The group agrees to euthanize Dale, but Rick himself cannot take the shot. Daryl takes the {{revolver}} and ends Dale's suffering.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} studies give two thermoregulatory roles for the sail of Dimetrodon: one {{as a means of}} warming quickly in the morning, and another as a way to cool down when body {{temperature}} becomes high. Dimetrodon and all other Early Permian land vertebrates are assumed to have been cold-blooded or poikilothermic, relying on the sun to maintain a high body temperature. Because of its large size, Dimetrodon had high thermal inertia, meaning that changes in body temperature occurred more slowly in it than in smaller-bodied animals. As temperatures rose in the mornings, the small-bodied prey of Dimetrodon could warm their bodies much faster than could something the size of Dimetrodon. Many paleontologists including Haack have proposed that the sail of Dimetrodon may have allowed it to warm quickly in the morning in order to keep pace with its prey. The sail's large surface area also meant heat could dissipate quickly into the surroundings, useful if the animal needed to release excess heat produced by metabolism or absorbed from the sun. Dimetrodon may have angled its sail away from the sun <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> <b>off</b> or restricted blood flow to the sail to maintain heat at night.|$|E
25|$|On January 3, 1841, the Acushnet set sail. Melville {{slept with}} some twenty {{others in the}} forecastle; captain Valentine Pease, the mates, and the skilled men slept aft. Whales were found near The Bahamas, and in March 150 barrels of oil were sent home from Rio de Janeiro. Cutting in and trying-out (boiling) a single whale took some three days, and a whale yielded {{approximately}} one barrel of oil per foot of length and per ton of weight (the average whale weighed 40 to 60 tons). The oil was kept on deck for a day <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> <b>off,</b> and was then stowed down; scrubbing the deck completed the labor. An average voyage meant that some forty whales were killed to yield some 1600 barrels of oil.|$|E

500|$|In {{an unfortunate}} coincidence, Hurricane Joan hit shortly after an armed {{conflict}} in the region had started <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> <b>off.</b> The hurricane destroyed much of the infrastructure in Nicaragua, contributing to a recession that was already underway. The losses to cash crops severely reduced exports to under 200million dollars (1988USD). These factors combined to aggravate a recession and deepen the economic crisis. Government spending to rebuild infrastructure negated recently introduced anti-inflation measures. Hurricane Joan was a partial cause of Nicaraguans being, on average, worse-off {{than they were in}} the 1970s. In all, the storm left at least 250,000 people homeless. Total damages in the country amounted to $751.1million. [...] Joan was the first major hurricane to strike Nicaragua since Edith in 1971.|$|E
500|$|Summit {{organizers}} {{established a}} media centre for international media personnel, journalists, and press {{reporters at the}} Direct Energy Centre at the Exhibition Place. [...] The Federal and Ontario governments constructed a [...] pavilion, called Experience Canada or Canadian Corridor in the media centre to promote Canadian tourism internationally. The pavilion included three life-sized government-funded displays: Cityscape, which showcased successful Canadian businesses and innovation; The Bridge, which included information kiosks for media personnel as well as large high-definition screens that televised the 2010 FIFA World Cup games; and Northern Ontario Oasis, an artificial lakefront based on Muskoka region's cottage country. The Northern Ontario Oasis included donated canoes, a shoreline with deck chairs for journalists <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> <b>off,</b> and a mobile phone recharging station. [...] The background was a large screen that portrayed various images of the Muskoka region.

2500|$|Mating occurs between August and December, and {{the pups}} are born between December and February. [...] Males arrive first to {{establish}} and defend territories, but then switch to defending females when they arrive. [...] A male aggressively herds females in his territory and defends both from neighbors and intruders. On rocky beaches, males establish territories where females go <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> <b>off,</b> keeping them until estrus. [...] On cobble or sandy beaches, males have territories near the surf and monopolize females trying {{to get access to}} the sea. The number of actual fights between males depends on the number of females in heat. The earlier a male arrives at the site, the longer his tenure will be and the more copulations he will achieve. Males are usually able to keep around three females in their harems, but some have as many as 18.|$|E

2500|$|Great changes {{took place}} in the crater after the eruption. Before 1911, the crater floor was higher than Taal lake and had several {{separate}} openings in which were lakes of different colors. There was a green lake, a yellow lake, a red lake and some holes filled with hot water from which steam issued. Many places were covered with a shaky crust of volcanic material, full of crevices, which was always hot and on which it was rather dangerous to walk. Immediately after the explosion, the vari-colored lakes had disappeared and in their place was one large lake, about ten feet below the level of the lake surrounding the island. The crater lake gradually rose until it is on a level with the water in Taal Lake. Opinions after the creation of the lake that the presence of the water in the crater has a tendency <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> <b>off</b> the material below and thus lessen the chances of an explosion or make the volcano extinct, but the preponderance of expert opinion was otherwise.(The subsequent eruption in 1965 and succeeding activities came from a new eruptive center, Mount Tabaro.) ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 5, 2003, Kimberly [...] "Kim" [...] Long {{went out}} bar-hopping with her boyfriend, Oswaldo [...] "Ozzy" [...] Conde and a mutual friend, Jeff Dills. When they {{returned}} to the apartment in Corona that Conde and Long shared, the couple got into an intense argument and Long left the apartment, accompanied by Dills, <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> <b>off.</b> Dills later dropped Long off at her apartment, where she found Conde brutally bludgeoned to death, the entire place covered with blood. She immediately called 911. No blood was found on Long. After being taken to the police station and questioned, Long was asked to take a polygraph test and passed it. Friends of the deceased man pointed to Conde's former girlfriend as a possible suspect. Dills, however, told police that he had dropped Long off at 1:20 am, rather than at 2:00 am, as she had told police. Police theorized that Long could have committed the murder of Conde after 1:20 am and before she called 911 at 2:09 am. (Dills died shortly afterwards in a motorcycle accident and thus could not be questioned about the time discrepancy.) Long was tried twice for Conde's murder: the first trial resulted in a hung jury, and the second resulted in a second-degree murder conviction. The judge at the second trial, Patrick F. Magers, stated that {{if it had been a}} court trial, rather than a jury trial, he would have acquitted the defendant. [...] "This is one of those classic cases where the person who finds the dead person ends up becoming a suspect," [...] said Brooks. After the CIP became involved in Long's case, they got the case retried in front of the same judge, with forensic evidence proving that Conde had definitely died before 1:20 am that morning; that, even assuming Dills was correct about the time he dropped Long off, it would have been physically impossible for Long to kill Conde and conceal her involvement within the period of less than an hour between 1:20 am and 2:09 am; and that a cigarette butt in the apartment revealed DNA from an unknown male. On June 10, 2016, Judge Magers reversed Long's original conviction, determining that she had been inadequately defended, and she was freed on bail after six years in prison.|$|E
