40|$|Background: Animal {{models with}} various {{combination}} of host-parasite {{have long been}} employed <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>malaria</b> pathogenesis. Here, we describe the combination of Plasmodium berghei ANKA infec-tion in inbred ICR mice {{as a model of}} cerebral malaria (CM). Methods: Infection in mice was initiated by intraperitoneal injection of 2 x 107 (0. 2 ml) parasitized red blood cells (PRBCs). Results: This model can produce a severe degree of infection presented by the high degree of parasitaemia followed by death 6 - 7 days post infection. Severe anemia, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and discolourations of major organs were observed. Histopathological findings revealed several im-portant features mimicking human CM including, microvascular sequestration of PRBCs in major organs, particularly in the brain, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the kupffer cells in the liver, pulmo-nary edema and hyaline membrane formation in the lungs and haemorrhages in the kidney’s medulla and cortex. Proinflammatory cytokines TNFα, IFNγ, IL- 1, IL- 6 and IL- 18, and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10 were all found to be elevated in the plasma of infected mice.

40|$|Objective: Malaria is an {{infectious}} disease commonplace in tropical countries. For many years, major antimalarial drugs consisted of natural products, but since 1930 s these drugs {{have been largely}} replaced {{with a series of}} synthetic drugs. This article tries to briefly indicate that some plants which previously were used to treat malaria, as a result of deficiencies of synthetic drugs, have revived into useful products once more. It also attempts to describe some tests which can be used to evaluate plant extracts for antimalarial activity. Materials and Methods: By referring to some recent literatures, data were collected about plants used for the treatment of malaria, evaluation of plant extracts for antimalarial activity, modes of action of natural antimalarial agents, and recent research on antimalarial plants in Iran and other countries. Results and Conclusion: There is an urgent need for the development of new treatments for malaria. Many countries have a vast precedence in the use of medicinal plants and the required knowledge spans many centuries. Although malaria is controlled in Iran, some researchers tend <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>malaria</b> and related subjects. In vitro biological tests for the detection of antimalarial activities in plant extracts are currently available. It is vital that the efficacy and safety of traditional medicines be validated and their active constituents be identified in order to establish reliable quality control measures...|$|E

Anopheles albimanus, one of the main malaria vectors in Central America, Southern Mexico and the Caribbean, was more susceptible to infection with PyN 67 than An. aquasalis, {{even in the absence of}} any pre-treatment, but was still less susceptible than Anopheles stephensi. Disruption of the complement-like system in An. albimanus significantly enhanced PyN 67 infection, indicating that the mosquito immune system is mounting effective antiplasmodial responses.

The phenotypes and genotypes of P. vinckei isolates have been relatively less characterized compared to other RMPs, hampering its use as an experimental model for malaria. Here, we have studied the phenotypes and sequenced the genomes and transcriptomes of ten P. vinckei isolates including representatives of all five subspecies, {{all of which were}} collected from wild thicket rats (Thamnomys rutilans) in sub-Saharan Central Africa between the late 1940 s and mid 1960 s.

40|$|The present paper reviews {{our recent}} data {{concerning}} the use of immunological methods employing monoclonal antibodies and synthetic peptides <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>malaria</b> transmission and immunity and to diagnose plasmodial infection. As concerns malaria transmission, we studied the main vectors of human malaria and the plasmodial species transmitted in endemic areas of Rondônia state, Brazil. The natural infection on anopheline was evaluated by immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) using monoclonal antibodies to an immunodominant sporozoite surface antigen (CS protein) demonstrated to be species specific. Our results showed that among six species of Anopheles found infected, An. darlingi was the main vector transmitting Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax malaria {{in the immediate vicinity}} of houses. In order to assess the level of anti-CS antibodies we studied, by IRMA using the synthetic peptide corresponding to the repetitive epitope of the sporozoite CS protein, sera of individuals living in the same areas where the entomological survey has been performed. In this assay the prevalence of anti-CS antibodies was very low and did not reflect the malaria transmission rate in the studied areas. In relation to malaria diagnosis, a monoclonal antibody specific to an epitope of a 50 kDa exoantigen, the major component of supernatant collected at the time of schizont rupture, was used as a probe for the detection of P. falciparum antigens. This assay seemed to be more sensitive than parasitological examination for malaria diagnosis since it was able to detect plasmodial antigens in both symptomatic and asymtomatic individuals with negative thick blood smear at different intervals after a last parasitologically confirmed confirmed attack of malaria...|$|E

40|$|The rodent malaria {{parasite}} Plasmodium yoelii {{has been}} an important animal model for studying malaria pathology and host-parasite interactions. Compared with other rodent malaria parasites such as Plasmodium chabaudi, however, genetic mapping studies on P. yoelii have been limited, partly due to the absence of genetic markers and the lack of well characterized phenotypes. Taking advantage of the available genome sequence, we initiated a project to develop a high-resolution microsatellite (MS) map for P. yoelii <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>malaria</b> disease phenotypes. Here we report screening the P. yoelii genome for simple sequence repeats and development of an inexpensive method (modified from a previously reported procedure) for typing malaria parasite MS: instead of labeling individual polymerase chain reaction primers, a single fluorescently labeled primer was used to type the MS markers. We evaluated various polymerase chain reaction cycling conditions and M 13 -tailed/labeled M 13 primer ratios to establish a simple and robust procedure for typing P. yoelii MS markers. We also compared typing efficiencies between individually labeled primers and the M 13 -tailed single labeled primer method and found that the two approaches were comparable. Preliminary analyses of seven P. yoelii isolates deposited at MR 4 with 77 MS showed that the markers were highly polymorphic and that the isolates belonged to two groups, suggesting potential common ancestry or laboratory contaminations among the isolates. The MS markers and the typing method provide important tools for genetic studies of P. yoelii. There is a good possibility that this method can be applied to type MS from other malaria parasites including important human pathogens Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax.

40|$|Malaria {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{parasitic}} diseases known to man, and the disease has played a role in shaping civilizations and the success of human populations over many centuries. While the malaria is well studied, it still remains a worldwide killer [...] claiming about 600, 000 lives annually with children under the age of five representing a disproportionate population of those lethally infected. Malaria is caused by the protozoan parasite Plasmodium, which is introduced to the human body through the bite of a female Anopheles mosquito. The most lethal form of the disease is carried by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, while the most widespread form of malaria is caused by Plasmodium vivax, the latter of which has a specific mode of entry and life cycle that makes it difficult to eradicate. The entry of P. vivax into human reticulocytes is based on the presence of the Duffy antigen chemokine receptor (DARC), which is uniquely absent in two-thirds of the Black population and populations of immediate African descent making it rare in the African region while endemic in Western and Asian countries. Inability to culture the parasite P. vivax in vitro and exhaustible tissue samples makes an accurate model of P. vivax malaria difficult to maintain ex vivo. The current study focuses on overcoming those limitations by modeling the mode of entry of P. vivax into patient-specific, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) -derived erythrocyte-lineage cells by showing firstly that DARC is a measurable marker of susceptibility in vitro via FACS analysis, and that secondly, P. vivax cell culture limitations can be bypassed by creating a lentivirus designed to specifically infect DARC-expressing cells. To demonstrate the potency of this system, we show that a virus expressing the conserved region of the Duffy binding ligand, Duffy binding protein II (DBPII), can selectively infect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that express DARC. Moreover, our current study focuses on the development of an iPSC-based disease model using patient samples derived from DARC expressing patients (DARC+) and DARC negative Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) patients (DARC-). We show that DARC+ iPSC-derived erythroid lineage cells express a transient population of DARC-expressing cells via FACS analysis, and we explore different protocols to stabilize this unique population. We hypothesize that DARC is a stage-specific marker for erythrocyte maturation, and we believe that any subset of cells expressing DARC consists of more mature erythrocyte-lineage cells. This study then, provides a novel platform by which <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>malaria</b> infection in a patient-specific manner while bypassing the limitations of culturing P. vivax in an in vitro culture system, as well as introducing a new way to measure erythrocyte maturation. Successful establishment of such a disease model has great implications for in-depth drug screenings for novel therapeutics that target the blood stage of the parasitic disease that were previously difficult to validate due to the limitations of currently existing models...|$|E
40|$|Background: Malaria is a {{parasitic}} disease which kills somewhere between 0. 5 to 3. 0 million people each year, 75 % {{of these are}} {{children under the age}} of five. The most affected region is sub-Saharan Africa. Our aim was <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>malaria</b> in children admitted at Haydom Lutheran Hospital (HLH), which is remotely situated in the Mbulu district in northern Tanzania. The hospital covers an area with around 440 000 people and malaria is endemic in this area. Material and methods: We conducted a follow up study in a period from 27. 06. 06 to 17. 07. 06 where we registered all patients below five years of age who were admitted with fever or other possible symptoms of malaria, and all children treated with quinine. The following data were registered: age, sex, length of admission, blood slide, fever, Hb, treatment and symptoms and outcome. Results/Discussion: 191 patients were included during the 3 week study period. The median age of the patients was 8 months and median admission length was 5 days. 12 of 191 patients died (6 % mortality). 72 children received a final clinical diagnosis of malaria, before considering the results of the blood slide. However, only 14 of 72 (19 %) had a positive malaria blood slide. 119 patients received different non-malaria diagnoses, but 7 (6 %) of these also had positive blood slide. There are significantly more positive blood slides in the group with the final clinical diagnosis of malaria compared to the rest of the patients (p < 0. 001), indicating that clinicians may recognize malaria clinically in 2 / 3 of all blood slide positive cases. 1 / 3 of the patients with positive blood slide did not receive a malaria diagnosis, still all of them received antimalaria treatment. In total 21 out of 185 patients had positive blood slide, which is lower than expected in an endemic area. However the registration was done in the dry season when the prevalence malaria in this area is fairly low. Many of the children were very young, and because of immunity due to maternal transfer of malaria antibodies they are not highly susceptible to get malaria. Despite the outcome of the lab results, the clinical state of the child was the most important criteria for starting treatment. The time from admission and start of treatment to the lab results arriving at the ward varied much and did not influence the anti malaria treatment. Since the decision was made to treat with antimalaria based on the clinical state of the child, it is correct to finish the treatment even if lab results later could not confirm the malaria diagnose. 29 patients without the malaria diagnose got antimalaria treatment. This suggests that the use of quinine was liberal at HLH. Over treatment with antimalarias can cause drug resistance and it is considered a major problem in Africa...|$|E

During its lifecycle, Plasmodium parasites either the human host or the Anopheles mosquito. For this, a sophisticated set of redundant invasion mechanisms is used, although the puzzle of these mechanisms is still far from being solved.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDMalaria is most {{prevalent}} in tropical climates, {{where there are}} sufficient rainfall for mosquitoes to breed and conducive temperatures for both the mosquito and protozoa to live. A slight change in temperature can drastically affect the lifespan and patterns of mosquitoes, and moreover, the protozoan itself can only survive in a certain temperature range. With higher temperatures, mosquitoes can mature faster, and thus {{have more time to}} spread the disease. The malaria parasite also matures more quickly at warmer temperatures. However, if temperatures become too high, neither mosquitoes nor the malaria pathogen can survive. In addition, stagnant water is also a major contributor to the spread of malaria, since most mosquito species breed in small pools of water. The correct amount and distribution of rainfall increases the possible breeding sites for mosquito larvae, which eventually results in more vectors to spread the disease. With little rainfall, there are few places for the mosquitoes to breed. For these reasons, and in order to control mosquito population, it is important to examine the weather parameters such as temperature and rainfall which are imperative in determining the disease epidemics. Accurate seasonal climate forecasts of these variables, together with malaria models should be able to drive an early warning system in endemic regions. These models {{can also be used to}} evaluate the possible change in regions under climate change scenarios, and the spread of malaria to new regions. In this study, we develop and analyse a mosquito model to study the population dynamics of mosquitoes. Ignoring the impact of climate, the model is further developed by introducing human compartments into the model. We perform both analytical and numerical analyses on the two models and verify that both models are epidemiological and mathematical well-posed. Using the next generation matrix method, the basic reproduction number of each system is calculated. Results from both analyses confirm that mosquito- and disease-free equilibria are locally asymptotically stable whenever R 0 1. We further establish the global stability of the mosquito-free equilibrium using a Lyapunov function. In order to examine the effectiveness of control measures, we calculate the sensitivity coefficients of the reproductive number of the mosquito-human malaria model and highlight the importance of mosquito biting rate on malaria transmission. In addition, we introduce climate dependent parameters of Anopheles gambiae and climate data of Limpopo province into the malaria model <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>malaria</b> transmission over the province. Climate variables and puddle dynamics are further incorporated into the mosquito model to study the dynamics of Anopheles arabiensis. The climatedependent functions are derived from the laboratory experiments in the study of Maharaj [114], and we further verify the sensitivity of the model to parameters through sensitivity analysis. Running the climate data of Dondotha village in Kwazulu-Natal province over the mosquito model, it is used to simulate the impact of climate variables on the population dynamics of Anopheles arabiensis over the village. Furthermore, we incorporate human compartments into the climate-based mosquito model to explore the impact of climate variability on malaria incidence over KwaZulu-Natal province over the period 1970 - 2005. The outputs of the climate-based mosquito-human malaria model are further analysed with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Wavelet Power Spectrum (WPS) and Wavelet Cross-coherence Analysis (WCA) to investigate the relationship between the climate variables and malaria transmission over the province. The results from the mosquito model fairly accurately quantify the seasonality of the population of Anopheles arabiensis over the study region and also demonstrate the influence of climatic factors on the vector population dynamics. The model simulates the population dynamics of both immature and adult Anopheles arabiensis and increases our understanding on the importance of mosquito biology in malaria models. Also, the simulated larval density produces a curve which is similar to observed data obtained from another study. In addition, the mosquito-malaria models produce reasonable fits with the observed data over Limpopo and KwaZulu Natal provinces. In particular, they capture all the spikes in malaria prevalence. Our results further highlight the importance of climate factors on malaria transmission and show the seasonality of malaria epidemics over the provinces. The results of the PCA on the model outputs suggest that there are two major process in the model simulation. One of the processes indicate high loadings on the population of Susceptible, Exposed and Infected humans, while the other is more correlated with Susceptible and Recovered humans. However, both processes reveal the inverse correlation between Susceptible-Infected and Susceptible-Recovered humans respectively. Through spectrum analysis, we notice a strong annual cycle of malaria incidence over the province and ascertain a dominant periodicity of one year. Consequently, our findings indicate that an average of 0 to 120 -day lag is generally noted over the study period, but the 120 -day lag is more associated with temperature than rainfall. The findings of this study would be useful in an early warning system or forecasting of malaria transmission over the study areas...|$|E

However, detailed methodology for SEM <b>studies</b> of <b>malaria</b> parasites is lacking in the literature making such studies challenging. Here, we provide a step-by-step guide to preparing Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes from two mouse strains for SEM analysis with minimal structural deterioration. We tested three species of murine malaria parasites, P. berghei, P. yoelii, and P. chabaudi, as well as non-parasitized human erythrocytes and P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes for comparisons. Our data demonstrated that the surface structures of parasitized erythrocytes between the three species of murine parasites in the two different strains of mice were indistinguishable and no surface alterations were observed in P. falciparum-erythrocytes. Our SEM observations contribute towards {{an understanding of the}} molecular mechanisms of parasite maturation in the erythrocyte cytoplasm and, along with future studies using our detailed methodology, may help to gain insight into the clinical phenomena of human malaria...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Plasmodium {{falciparum malaria}} {{accounts}} for > 1 million deaths annually, mostly among {{young children in}} sub-Saharan Africa. Identifying those individuals {{who are likely to}} die is crucial. Several factors have been independently associated with death. Because malaria is a systemic disease, a quantitative score combining such risk factors may be superior. METHODS: We used both forward and backward stepwise logistic regression to select the best predictors of death, as evaluated for 23, 890 African children with severe P. falciparum <b>malaria.</b> The <b>study</b> was conducted from December 2000 through May 2005 in 6 hospital-based research units (in Banjul in the Gambia, Blantyre in Malawi, Kilifi in Kenya, Kumasi in Ghana, and Lambaréné and Libreville in Gabon) in a network established <b>to</b> <b>study</b> severe <b>malaria</b> in African children (ie, the SMAC Network). RESULTS: The Lambaréné Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS) combines 3 variables: coma, prostration, and deep breathing. A LODS > 0 (odd ratio, 9. 6; 95 % confidence interval, 8. 0 - 11. 4) has 85 % sensitivity to predict death, and a LODS < 3 is highly (98 %) specific for survival. CONCLUSIONS: The LODS is a simple clinical predictor of fatal malaria in African children. This score provides accurate and rapid identification of children needing either referral or increased attention...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge, {{practices}} and perceptions which affect acquiring malaria in man-made malarious area in Khartoum State, Sudan- Abd/El-Gayoum et al ABSTARTCT: A cross- sectional descriptive study {{was carried out}} among people of ElAzergab area. This area was chosen as a model <b>to</b> <b>study</b> Sudanese <b>malaria</b> knowledge attitude and practices (KAP) in man- made malarious areas. This area is situated along the eastern bank of the River Nile north of Khartoum North, in Khartoum State. The aim is to determine risk factors associated with malaria. Data were collected from 167 households. The survey deals with sociodemographic characteristics, history of malaria, knowledge, attitudes, practices, preservation measures and treatment seeking behaviour. Ninety one percent of household heads reported malaria attack among household members in the previous year. Risk of malaria attack {{was significantly associated with}} family grade of education, occupation of household head, water and electric supply, economic status of the family, number of rooms, expenses of treatment, treatment seeking behaviour. About 76. 6 % of household heads reported delayed treatment seeking behaviour for malaria. Knowledge, attitude and practice have no association with malaria attacks except for a 2 - fold increased risk of malaria in people obtaining water from irrigation canals.

40|$|Malaria is on of {{the most}} {{important}} parasitic infections in humans and more than two billion people are at risk every year. There were an estimated 247 million malaria cases in 2006, causing nearly a million deaths. Currently, malaria is still endemic in 109 countries. Human malaria is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium, transmitted from human-to-human by the female Anopheles mosquito. Over the past century, considerable work has been invested in the <b>study</b> of <b>malaria</b> transmission. However, only a few <b>studies</b> with <b>malaria</b> consider the spatial and temporal heterogeneities of this disease. Hence, there is an essential need {{for more information on the}} spatial and temporal patterns of disease burden, distribution and control strategies. The aim of this thesis is <b>to</b> <b>study</b> the <b>malaria</b> transmission in heterogeneous environments. [...] We begin with a brief introduction of mathematical background for this thesis in chapter 1. We shall provide some mathematical terminologies and theorems related to the theories of monotone dynamical systems, uniform persistence, basic reproduction ratio, spreading speeds and traveling waves. [...] Chapter 2 is devoted <b>to</b> the <b>study</b> of global dynamics of a periodic susceptible-infected-susceptible compartmental model with maturation delay. We first obtain sufficient conditions for the single population growth equation to admit a globally attractive positive periodic solution. Then we introduce the basic reproduction ratio Rₒ for the epidemic model, and show that the disease dies out when Rₒ 1. Numerical simulations are also provided to confirm our analytic results. The study in this chapter also enables us to consider time-delayed and periodic <b>malaria</b> results. The <b>study</b> in this chapter also enables us to consider time-delayed and periodic malaria models. [...] In chapter 3, we present a malaria transmission model with periodic birth rate and age structure for the vector population. We first introduce the basic reproduction ratio for this model and then show that there exists at least one positive periodic state and that the disease persists when Rₒ > 1. It is also shown that the disease will die out if Rₒ < 1, provided that the invasion intensity is not strong. We further use these analytic results <b>to</b> <b>study</b> the <b>malaria</b> transmission cases in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. Some sensitivity analysis of Rₒ is performed, and in particular, the potential impact of climate change on seasonal transmission and populations at risk of the disease is analyzed. [...] Based on the classical Ross-Macdonald model, we propose in chapter 4 a periodic model with diffusion and advection <b>to</b> <b>study</b> the possible impact of the mobility of humans and mosquitoes on malaria transmission. We establish the existence of the leftward and rightward spreading speeds and their coincidence with the minimum wave speeds in the left and right directions, respectively. For the model in a bounded domain, we obtain a threshold result on the global attractivity of either zero or a positive periodic solution. [...] To understand how the spatial heterogeneity and extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of the parasite within the mosquito affect the dynamics of malaria epidemiology, we formulate a nonlocal and time-delayed reaction-diffusion model in chapter 5. We thin define the basic reproduction ratio Rₒ and show that Rₒ serves as a threshold parameter that predicts whether malaria will spread. Furthermore, a sufficient condition is obtained to guarantee that the disease will stabilize at a positive steady state eventually in the case where all the parameters are spatially independent. Numerically, we show that the use of the spatially averaged system my highly underestimate the malaria risk. The spatially heterogeneous framework in this chapter can be used to design the spatial allocation of control resources. [...] At last, we summarize the results in this thesis, and also point out some problems for future research in chapter 6...|$|R
40|$|Although several animal {{models for}} human {{cerebral}} malaria {{have been proposed}} in the past, name have shown pathological findings {{that are similar to}} those seen in humans.
