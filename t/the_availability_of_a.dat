5|$|The {{construction}} of a von Neumann computer depended on <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suitable memory device on which to store the program. During the Second World War researchers working {{on the problem of}} removing the clutter from radar signals had developed a form of delay line memory, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line, developed by J. Presper Eckert. Radar transmitters send out regular brief pulses of radio energy, the reflections from which are displayed on a CRT screen. As operators are usually interested only in moving targets, it was desirable to filter out any distracting reflections from stationary objects. The filtering was achieved by comparing each received pulse with the previous pulse, and rejecting both if they were identical, leaving a signal containing only the images of any moving objects. To store each received pulse for later comparison it was passed through a transmission line, delaying it by exactly the time between transmitted pulses.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} {{construction of}} a von Neumann computer depended on <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suitable memory device. The University of Manchester's Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), the world's first stored-program computer, had successfully demonstrated the practicality of the stored-program approach and of the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory based on a standard cathode ray tube (CRT), by running its first program in June 1948. Early electronic computers were generally programmed by being rewired, or via plugs and patch panels; there was no separate program stored in memory, as in a modern computer. It could take several days to reprogram ENIAC, for instance. Stored-program computers were also being developed by other researchers, notably the National Physical Laboratory's Pilot ACE, Cambridge University's EDSAC, and the US Army's EDVAC. The SSEM and the Mark 1 differed primarily {{in their use of}} Williams tubes as memory devices, instead of mercury delay lines.|$|E
5|$|Not all early roguelikes were readily {{classified}} as Hack or Moria descendants. Larn (1986), developed by Noah Morgan, borrowed concepts from both Hack (in {{that there are}} persistent and fixed levels) and Moria (in <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shop level and general difficulty increasing with dungeon level), but while these two games have spiraled in size to take multiple play sessions to complete, Larn was aimed {{to be completed in}} a single session. Larn also uses a fixed-time feature, in that the player had only so many turns to complete a goal, though there were ways to jump back in time as to extend play. Omega, developed by the Laurence Brothers in the late 1980s, is credited with introducing an overworld concept to the roguelike genre, prior to the feature's appearance in ADOM. Omega was often remembered for its odd inventory approach in which the player would have to pick up an object, considering it being held, and then moving that object to a bag or an equipment slot. Linley's Dungeon Crawl (1995) was created by Linley Henzell and featured a skill-based character progression system, in which experience points could be used to improve specific skills, such as weapon proficiency or trap detection. One fork of this would form the basis for Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (2006). SSI's Dungeon Hack (1993) offered randomized dungeons and permadeath within AD 2nd Edition rules.|$|E

25|$|The {{subroutine}} concept led to <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> substantial subroutine library.

25|$|The Unix {{operating}} system was conceived and implemented in 1969 at AT's Bell Laboratories in the United States by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna. First released in 1971, Unix was written entirely in assembly language, as was common {{practice at the}} time. Later, in a key pioneering approach in 1973, it was rewritten in the C programming language by Dennis Ritchie (with the exception of some hardware and I/O routines). <b>The</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high-level language implementation of Unix made its porting to different computer platforms easier.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> continuous, high-fidelity, {{calibrated}} {{blood pressure}} waveform {{opened up the}} perspective of beat-to-beat computation of integrated haemodynamics, based on two notions: pressure and flow are inter-related at each site in the arterial system by their so-called characteristic impedance. At the proximal aortic site, the 3-element Windkessel model of this impedance can be modelled with sufficient accuracy in an individual patient with known age, gender, height and weight. According to comparisons of non-invasive peripheral vascular monitors, modest clinical utility is restricted to patients with normal and invariant circulation.|$|E
25|$|In April 1975, the Van {{received}} a higher roof {{and became a}} four-seater. This was necessitated by Japanese commercial vehicle regulation which require the floor to be completely flat when the rear seat is folded. Because the Rex's engine was mounted in the rear, the cargo floor was rather high, meaning that more head room would be required before a seat could be installed. The Wagon continued in production until the SEEC-T version was introduced in December, but it lost most of its market with <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> four-seater Van.|$|E
