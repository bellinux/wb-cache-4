5|$|In The Girlie Show in 1993, {{the song}} was {{performed}} in an alternate version as the second to last song of the tour. It had a military theme to it. Halfway through the performance Madonna paused the song for a military drill with the dancers and the audience. The performance met with strong reaction in Puerto Rico, when Madonna rubbed the Puerto Rican national flag between her legs in between the performance. For the Drowned World Tour in 2001 Madonna wore a fur coat, velvet fedora and a customised Dolce & Gabbana T-shirt which proclaimed 'Mother' {{in the front and}} 'F*cker' in the back painted in silver. <b>This</b> <b>demonstrated</b> her ghetto-girl appearance adopted for the song's performance.|$|E
5|$|The HVO, {{supported}} by Croatian Army artillery deployed {{north of the}} river, managed to withstand the offensive and the front line remained unchanged from the commencement of the battle. <b>This</b> <b>demonstrated</b> the changed balance of power {{at this stage of}} the war. At the commencement of the war, the VRS had greater military capabilities than its opponents, particularly in terms of heavy weapons and organisation, but over three years from mid-1992 its capabilities had been matched by its adversaries.|$|E
5|$|Although the reaction, which {{included}} punishment, new regulations, SRM institutional reform, fewer Vietnamese serving in France, increased specialisation – were considerable, {{military and civilian}} authorities in both Vietnam and France did not believe them sufficient for the reassertion of control over their colonised troops. A further four decisions were implemented, aimed at striking the a stable racial balance among the troops in French Indochina. The number of ethnic Vietnamese soldiers was perceived to be too great and thus threatening {{in the wake of}} the mutiny. A safer proportion aimed at reducing the overall ratio among Indochina's colonial troops of 1:1 ethnic Vietnamese to European and indigenous ethnic minorities (Montagnards) was implemented. <b>This</b> <b>demonstrated</b> French distrust of Vietnamese troops and the apparent belief that the fidelity of Vietnamese soldiers was maximised by creating a racial balance within the army that was tilted towards showing all Vietnamese soldiers – and thereby the Vietnamese population at large – the futility of attempting insurrection and mutiny.|$|E

5|$|Because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes, xenon isotope ratios in meteorites are a {{powerful}} tool for studying the formation of the Solar System. The iodine–xenon method of dating gives the time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and the condensation of a solid object from the solar nebula. In 1960, physicist John H. Reynolds discovered that certain meteorites contained an isotopic anomaly {{in the form of an}} overabundance of xenon-129. He inferred that this was a decay product of radioactive iodine-129. This isotope is produced slowly by cosmic ray spallation and nuclear fission, but is produced in quantity only in supernova explosions. Because the half-life of 129I is comparatively short on a cosmological time scale (16 million years), <b>this</b> <b>demonstrated</b> that only a short time had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the 129I. These two events (supernova and solidification of gas cloud) were inferred to have happened during the early history of the Solar System, because the 129I isotope was likely generated shortly before the Solar System was formed, seeding the solar gas cloud with isotopes from a second source. This supernova source may also have caused collapse of the solar gas cloud.|$|E
5|$|In situ measurements, in real-time, can {{be taken}} by sending {{specially}} equipped reconnaissance flights into the cyclone. In the Atlantic basin, these flights are regularly flown by United States government hurricane hunters. The aircraft used are WC-130 Hercules and WP-3D Orions, both four-engine turboprop cargo aircraft. These aircraft fly directly into the cyclone and take direct and remote-sensing measurements. The aircraft also launch GPS dropsondes inside the cyclone. These sondes measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and especially winds between flight level and the ocean's surface. A new era in hurricane observation began when a remotely piloted Aerosonde, a small drone aircraft, was flown through Tropical Storm Ophelia as it passed Virginia's Eastern Shore during the 2005 hurricane season. A similar mission was also completed successfully in the western Pacific Ocean. <b>This</b> <b>demonstrated</b> {{a new way to}} probe the storms at low altitudes that human pilots seldom dare.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{exceptions}} were made; Israel and Egypt {{could buy}} advanced designs under the Camp David Agreements, Israel was {{even allowed to}} buy McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagles, a key component in U.S. air-defense technology. Iran was already receiving the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, and <b>this</b> <b>demonstrated</b> the problem with advanced exports in February 1979 when reports emerged that Iran had sold an AIM-54 Phoenix missile to the Soviets. South Korea's F-16 order was initially blocked under this policy, but later allowed {{in the context of}} strengthening relations. Despite exceptions, the export policy was implemented, covering many potential and current customers. As the F-5G was a relatively modest upgrade to the F-5E, the F-5G appeared to be in a strong position for sales given the limitations placed on rival designs, however Carter personally blocked the sales of the F-5G to Taiwan.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{have sought}} to find the precise {{function}} of Mups in pheromone communication. Mup proteins {{have been shown to}} promote puberty and accelerate the estrus cycle in female mice, inducing the Vandenbergh and Whitten effects. However, in both cases the Mups had to be presented to the female dissolved in male urine, indicating that the protein requires some urinary context to function. In 2007 Mups normally found in male mouse urine were made in transgenic bacteria, and therefore created devoid of the chemicals they normally bind. These Mups were shown to be sufficient to promote aggressive behaviour in males, {{even in the absence of}} urine. In addition, Mups made in bacteria were found to activate olfactory sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific sensory receptors, of mice and rats. Together, <b>this</b> <b>demonstrated</b> that Mup proteins can act as pheromones themselves, independent of their ligands.|$|E

25|$|In Syria {{a general}} strike took place from 20 January to 6 March 1936 {{spreading}} to all the major towns, and political demonstrations held throughout the country gave fresh momentum to the Syrian national movement.

25|$|With the Ka-14 demonstrating {{excellent}} performance, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force {{ordered a}} single modified prototype for evaluation as the Ki-18. While <b>this</b> <b>demonstrated</b> similar performance to the Navy aircraft and hence was far {{faster than the}} IJAAF's current fighter, the Kawasaki Ki-10 biplane, the type {{was rejected by the}} army owing to its reduced maneuverability. The Army then produced a specification for an improved advanced fighter to replace the Ki-10. Mitsubishi, busy turning the Ka-14 into the A5M, submitted a minimally changed aircraft as the Ki-33, this being defeated by Nakajima's competing aircraft, which was ordered into service as the Ki-27.|$|E

J.P. showed normal perceptual priming, but his conceptual priming ability for spoken words was, expectedly, impaired. Another patient, N.G., {{who suffered}} from prosopanomia (the inability to retrieve proper names) following damage to his left temporal lobe, was unable to spontaneously provide names of persons or cities, but was able to successfully complete a word-fragment completion exercise following priming with these names. <b>This</b> <b>demonstrated</b> intact perceptual priming abilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} for Irwin was to {{determine}} if transsaccadic memory is tied to spatial position. He performed experiments using dot patterns and later, performed the same type of experiment alongside McConkie in his effort to prove the saccade target hypothesis. In those experiments, the researchers used a picture instead of dot patterns. Participants in the experimental condition were given an initial eye position, followed by a saccade target position on the picture. Unlike Irwin’s first experiment, where the pattern did not change spatial location during the saccade, the picture underwent one of three shift conditions: All shift down, target object shift down, or background shift up. Detection of change ended up being much higher when only the target object moved compared to when the entire image shifted. <b>This</b> <b>demonstrated</b> the importance of the target object in detection of image displacements.|$|E
25|$|From 1976 to 1981, the York Archaeological Trust {{conducted}} a five-year excavation {{in and around}} the street of Coppergate in central York. <b>This</b> <b>demonstrated</b> that, in the 10th century, Jórvík's trading connections reached to the Byzantine Empire and beyond: a cap made of silk survives, and coins from Samarkand were familiar enough and respected enough for a counterfeit to have passed in trade. Both these items, as well as a large human coprolite known as the Lloyds Bank coprolite, were famously recovered in York a millennium later. Amber from the Baltic is often expected at a Viking site and at Jórvík an impractical and presumably symbolic axehead of amber was found. A cowrie shell indicates contact with the Red Sea or the Persian Gulf.

25|$|The last stadtholder, William V, fled {{with his}} son William Frederick to England on 18 January 1795, where they were granted a subsidy to {{compensate}} for the loss of all their possessions in the Netherlands, confiscated by the Batavian government. After losing hope of restoring the Orange dynasty following the disastrous Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, William Frederick commenced negotiations with First Consul Napoleon of the French Republic. His attempts to be appointed President of the Batavian Republic while forsaking his hereditary succession were unsuccessful, as were his enormous demands of 117 million guilders in compensation for the lost domains and alleged debt he demanded from the Batavian Republic. In December 1801, William V issued the Oranienstein Letters, in which he formally recognised the Batavian Republic, as Napoleon demanded as precondition for any compensation. He would later refuse Napoleon's offer of Fulda and Corvey, which arguably demonstrated his selflessness. Unlike his father, however, and despite his father's protestations, William Frederick continued pursuing more financial and territorial compensation, and eventually settled for the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda and a 5 million guilder indemnity by the Batavian Republic in 1802, whilst renouncing all his claims to the Netherlands. According to republicans, <b>this</b> <b>demonstrated</b> his personal greed and lack of any real devotion to the Dutch people. Moreover, when Napoleon discovered that his vassal William Frederick was secretly plotting with Prussia and refused to join the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806, he took Fulda from him again, after which William Frederick went into Prussian and later Austrian military service instead.|$|E
