5|$|In the story, Booster Gold {{is charged}} by Rip Hunter {{to go back}} in time and save Barbara from being shot by the Joker. Booster arrives at the {{carnival}} shortly after the Joker has rounded up the freaks, only to be attacked by them. He manages to escape (after the Joker torments him), but arrives too late to save Barbara. Catching the Joker in the middle of taking photos of the wounded Barbara (after having struck down Commissioner Gordon), Booster attacks the Joker in a rage; the Joker nevertheless gains the upper hand, snapping several photos of Booster as well. Rip removes Booster moments before he is killed, but Booster demands to be sent back again. Booster fails several times until Rip reveals that the Joker is destined to paralyze her, as it would ensure that she would become Oracle. Rip did this to demonstrate <b>to</b> <b>Booster</b> that some points in time, like Barbara's paralysis, are fixed and cannot be prevented or altered, so that Booster would not continue insisting on rescuing his friend Ted Kord from death, another fixed point.|$|E
5|$|Schirra {{was awakened}} at 1:40 am ET {{on the morning}} of October 3, and after a hearty breakfast—including a {{bluefish}} he had speared the day before—and a brief physical he left for the launchpad at around 4 am. He entered the spacecraft at 4:41 am ET, where he found a steak sandwich left for him in the 'glove compartment', and began the pre-launch checks. The launch countdown proceeded as planned until 6:15, when there was a 15-minute hold to allow the Canary Islands tracking station to repair a radar set. The countdown resumed at 6:30 and proceeded <b>to</b> <b>booster</b> ignition with no further delays. Liftoff proceeded smoothly, but there was a momentary clockwise roll transient at liftoff, which reached 7.83° per second and approached 80% of the required threshold to trigger the ASIS abort system. This was later identified as being due to a slight misalignment of the main engines and was kept under control by the booster's vernier thrusters. Sustainer engine thrust during the launch was slightly below normal and fuel consumption higher than normal due to a suspected leak in the sustainer fuel system.|$|E

5|$|On 7 November, {{engineers}} {{determined that}} there was no additional work needed to verify the solid rocket boosters for flight, following discovery of small cracks in the hold-down posts attached <b>to</b> <b>boosters</b> that had flown earlier that year. Close inspections of the STS-74 stack determined that no such cracks were present on the <b>boosters</b> <b>to</b> be used for the mission.|$|R
40|$|A {{solution}} {{was developed to}} mitigate the potential risk of ignition failures and burn-through in aluminum primer chamber assemblies on pyrovalves. This was accomplished by changing the assembly material from aluminum to steel, and reconfiguration of flame channels to provide more direct paths from initiators <b>to</b> <b>boosters.</b> With the geometric configuration of the channels changed, energy is more efficiently transferred from the initiators <b>to</b> the <b>boosters.</b> With the alloy change to steel, the initiator flame channels do not erode upon firing, eliminating the possibility of burn-through. Flight qualification tests have been successfully passed...|$|R

25|$|The One Million {{version of}} Booster Gold {{is a time}} {{traveler}} named Peter Platinum ("Platinum always beats gold") who appears in Booster Gold vol. 2, #1000000. Based on Booster's reputation as a profiteer posing as a hero, Platinum admits <b>to</b> <b>Booster</b> that he is pulling the same scam, but more successfully, and assumes Booster is after a cut. His superhero gear is based on technology stolen from Rip Hunter, who has apparently had several encounters with him to get it back.|$|E
25|$|Maternal passive {{immunity}} {{is a type}} of naturally acquired {{passive immunity}}, and refers to antibody-mediated immunity conveyed to a fetus or infant by its mother. Naturally acquired passive immunity can be provided during pregnancy, and through breastfeeding. In humans, maternal antibodies (MatAb) are passed through the placenta to the fetus by an FcRn receptor on placental cells. This occurs predominately during the third trimester of pregnancy, and thus is often reduced in babies born prematurely. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the only antibody isotype that can pass through the human placenta, and is the most common antibody of the five types of antibodies found in the body. IgG antibodies protects against bacterial and viral infections in fetuses. Immunization is often required shortly following birth to prevent diseases in newborns such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B, polio, and pertussis, however, maternal IgG can inhibit the induction of protective vaccine responses throughout the first year of life. This effect is usually overcome by secondary responses <b>to</b> <b>booster</b> immunization.|$|E
25|$|Abrash {{committed}} his division's 78th Armored Brigade in {{the northern}} sector at 22:00. He was behind schedule, but expected {{to make up for}} it if the 78th Brigade could reach and secure the Kuneitra-Mas'ade Road, four and a half kilometres west of its starting line. It was believed that achieving this mission would cause the Israeli defenses to collapse. Each of the 82nd Brigade's ninety-five T-55's tanks was equipped with a specially designed infrared nightscope. The night was brightly moonlit. The 82nd Brigade moved up the valley just two and a half kilometres from the Kuneitra-Masada Road. Ben Gal used his artillery for illumination, and ordered his men to remain silent until the Syrians were well within range. By 22:00, the Syrian tanks were within 800 meters of the Israeli positions. Both sides lost tanks to the terrain. Captain Yair Swet, a 77th Battalion company commander, was ordered to move <b>to</b> <b>Booster</b> and lost two tanks as a result. One crew managed to extricate its tank and use it to pull the other, but the delay distracted the battalion.|$|E
50|$|Direct action fuze {{designs are}} 'super-quick' but {{may have a}} delay option. 20th-century designs vary in the {{relative}} positions of their key elements. The extremes being the firing pin and detonator close to the nose with a long flash tube <b>to</b> the <b>booster</b> (typical in US designs), or a long firing pin to a detonator close <b>to</b> the <b>booster</b> and a short flash tube (typical in British designs).|$|R
50|$|This second hole {{is filled}} with black powder which acts as a delay train. For {{instantaneous}} action the plug is turned so that the flash travels directly from the detonator <b>to</b> the <b>booster</b> without passing through the delay train.

After {{defeating}} his henchmen, Knife Guy and Grate Guy, they follow Booster to Marymore. They enter the church and intercept the princess, just before she is forcibly married <b>to</b> <b>Booster,</b> but Chef Torte and his apprentice attempt to prevent their escape. While fighting them, the wedding cake that they made comes to life, forcing the chefs to flee, leaving Mario and friends to deal with the living cake (who name is Bundt). Booster helps defeat Bundt by swallowing it whole and now satisfied and no longer needing Toadstool, he returns to his tower in hopes a new wife will come to him overtime.|$|E

There they meet Mallow's grandfather, who reveals that Mallow isn't really a tadpole and claims that his real parents are {{waiting for him to}} return home. The duo travel to Rose Town where they meet a star spirit who has taken control of a doll named Geno. After battling the bow-like creature, Bowyer, who is immobilizing {{residents}} of Rose Town with his arrows, they retrieve another Star Piece and Geno joins Mario and tells him that the Star Piece {{is a part of the}} shattered Star Road, where he resides. A surviving Aero, who is one of Bowyer's minions, runs off to warn Smitty. Geno has been tasked with repairing Star Road and defeating Smithy, so that the world's wishes may again be heard, and he must find the seven pieces held by members of the Smithy gang. The three head to the Mole Mountains where they fight Croco again, rescue two trapped mole children, and retrieve the third Star Piece from Punchinello before heading <b>to</b> <b>Booster</b> Tower (the home of the eccentric amusement-venue owner, Booster) where they encounter Bowser, whose minions have all bailed out on him.|$|E
500|$|In 1932, Byrd was {{promoted}} to {{vice president of the}} university. In July 1935, he was named the acting president of the university, and was officially appointed to the presidency in February 1936. During his tenure, the budget, facilities, faculty, and enrollment increased significantly. The school budget was increased and the campus expanded largely due to Byrd's deft political maneuvering in Annapolis and Washington. The school also saw a large growth in enrollment, due in part to returning veterans making use of the G.I. Bill after World War II. From 1945 to 1948, the university budget increased from $4.8 million to $9.8 million. Between 1935 and 1954, student enrollment grew from 3,400 to 16,000. Over that same time period, the value of the campus rose from $5 million to $65 million. Byrd, however stood fast on faculty salaries. He reportedly said, [...] "Ph.D.s are a dime a dozen." [...] For years, Byrd refused to release the university's financial records to state legislators, and how exactly he secured funding for many of his projects was largely a mystery. According <b>to</b> <b>booster</b> Jack Heise, Byrd financed a new basketball arena through the out-of-state tuition, paid by the federal government, for Maryland high school graduates who attended the university on the G.I. Bill. The General Accounting Office calculated that the extra fees totaled more than $2 million, but determined that they were within the bounds of legality.|$|E

50|$|To {{protect himself}} and his own history, Rip convinces <b>Booster</b> <b>to</b> turn down {{membership}} in the recently reformed Justice League and to continue {{to act like a}} self-absorbed goof in order to make sure that his father's legacy is one of failure and is ultimately forgotten by history. This is done to ensure rogue time travelers have no motivation <b>to</b> kill <b>Booster</b> in the past, erasing Rip in the process and the various works he and Booster will engage in to protect the timestream. Rip and an older Booster occasionally would interact during the present version's mission, as they discuss the need <b>to</b> manipulate <b>Booster</b> (in particular, taunting him with the chance to change history and prevent the death of Ted Kord and the crippling of Kord's one-time girlfriend Barbara Gordon).|$|R
2500|$|The Mercury-Redstone's {{automatic}} in-flight abort {{sensing system}} solved {{this problem by}} monitoring the rocket's performance during flight. If it detected an anomaly which might threaten the astronaut, such as loss of flight control, engine thrust, or electrical power, it would automatically abort, shutting down the engine and activating the capsule's escape system. The abort system could not shut off the engine until at least 30 seconds after liftoff {{in order to prevent}} a malfunctioning launch vehicle from coming down on or near the pad; during the initial 30 seconds, only the Range Safety Officer could terminate the flight. Review of flight data from the more than 60 Redstone and Jupiter C launches since 1953 was used to analyze the most likely failure modes of this launch vehicle family. In the interest of simplicity, the abort sensing system had to be kept as simple as possible and only monitor parameters that were vital <b>to</b> <b>booster</b> operation. An automatic abort could be triggered by any of the following conditions, all of which could be indicative of a catastrophic launch vehicle malfunction: ...|$|E
