5|$|Even if the Huskies {{were still}} a strong {{national}} contender, {{they were no longer}} viewed as a favorite <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> Two key rivals were the usual conference foe Notre Dame and the new rival Baylor, who had the nation's top player in Brittney Griner. In December Griner led #1 ranked Baylor against #2 UConn, scoring 25 points to go along with nine blocks. The 66–61 loss was UConn's first of the season, but not its last. Notre Dame, led by junior star Skylar Diggins, beat the Huskies twice in the regular season, but UConn was able to reverse the roles in the Big East Tournament Championship Game; the win was the school's 15th conference title, as well as the 800th career win for coach Geno Auriemma. Ultimately Notre Dame found its revenge with an upset win in the NCAA Tournament Final Four, ending the season with a 3–1 record against the Huskies, a record that would be repeated the following year.|$|E
25|$|The Panthers {{became the}} first No. 3 seed {{to advance to the}} Super Bowl since the league {{expanded}} to a 12-team playoff format in 1990. In doing so, they were also the first division winner to advance to the league championship after playing three playoff games. All other instances up to this point where teams advanced to the Super Bowl after playing all three rounds of the playoffs were wild card teams in Super Bowls XV, XX, XXVII, XXXII, XXXIV, and XXXV. Prior to Super Bowl XVII, the Miami Dolphins and Washington Redskins both won three playoff games to reach the Super Bowl, but that came during the strike-shortened 1982 season when the regular season was reduced to nine games and the playoffs were expanded to 16 teams, with no teams receiving first-round byes. Since then, there have been six instances of teams advancing to the Super Bowl after playing three playoff games: the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XL as the No. 6 seeded team, the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLI as the No. 3 seed, the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII as the No. 5 seed, the Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII as the No. 4 seed, the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XLV as the No. 6 seed, and again the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLVI as the No. 4 seed. The Colts, Cardinals, and the Giants in 2011, like the Panthers, were division winners in those years (Although in the Colts case, they played the No. 4 seeded New England Patriots in the AFC Championship that year, ensuring at least the second division winner to play three rounds {{to make it to the}} Super Bowl.), and all but the Cardinals went on <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> The Super Bowl would mark the third game (out of four) of the playoffs in which Carolina scored 29 points.|$|E

40|$|Full Text: The Entitled: A Tale of Modern Baseball by Frank Deford. Naperville, Ill., Sourcebooks, 2007, 352 pp, 24. 95. MICHAEL D. ROY Arlington, Va. The {{aptly named}} Howie Traveler is a {{baseball}} manager who, after bouncing around the farmtowns and milltowns that populate baseball 9 ̆ 2 s minor leagues, has finally gotten his call-up to "The Show" {{as manager of}} the Cleveland Indians. Unfortunately for Howie, the book begins at the point that {{his life as a}} big league manager seems about to end. As he prepares his underachieving team, including underperforming superstar Jay Alcazar, to play a series against the Orioles, Howie is certain he is about to be fired. More precisely, that he "won 9 ̆ 2 t get outta Baltimore alive. " To lose this job would mean certain death in terms of his big league dreams. The baseball barons who control the fates of their minions in the major league will not be proffering another opportunity to a former career minor leaguer who couldn 9 ̆ 2 t take top-rate talent to the title. Those kinds of opportunities only come once. Howie may have gotten close the previous year to collecting a championship for long-suffering Cleveland fans, but the flip side of baseball 9 ̆ 2 s eternal optimism ("Wait 9 ̆ 1 til next year!") is the all too grim reality that one {{is only as good as}} one 9 ̆ 2 s current record. And Cleveland 9 ̆ 2 s current record was bad. What went wrong? His cast from the preceding year, who came ever so close <b>to</b> <b>winning</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> was back essentially unchanged, and in Jay Alcazar the Indians had what all teams covet: a bona fide, top-shelf talent with transcendent athletic ability. However, this year Howie feels somewhat betrayed by his superstar. In fact, he initially thinks Alcazar is secretly sandbagging to get him fired and a fellow Latino installed as the new manager. The truth behind the drop in Alcazar 9 ̆ 2 s performance is something so much more elemental to his core identity than a shared heritage. I 9 ̆ 2 m not revealing anything critical to the book by saying Howie doesn 9 ̆ 2 t lose his job in Baltimore that weekend. The reader learns that in the first few chapters. Howie earns a reprieve because of a crisis off the field involving, alas, Jay Alcazar. While the narrative hook of The Entitled is what may or may not have occurred one weekend in Baltimore, it is Alcazar 9 ̆ 2 s backstory that drives the novel and makes it so much more than a simple baseball book. In what could have easily been a second novel we learn of the outfielder 9 ̆ 2 s childhood torn asunder in Castro 9 ̆ 2 s Cuba, with his semi-triumphant, albeit mostly incognito, return to the island to reconnect with his past. The book is a work of fiction, but with all the real team names (and some real player names) peppered throughout, the fiction feels thinly veiled. One wonders whether Deford is attempting to pull back the curtain on 21 st-century baseball as Jim Bouton did with Ball Four a generation ago. But at one point nearly midway in the book, the veil becomes thin to the point of distraction. In a flashback recounting Alcazar 9 ̆ 2 s meeting with Cleveland Plain Dealer scribe Mickey Huey, the latter laments the waning influence that writers have on the shaping of athletes 9 ̆ 2 images. The reporter points derisively to the television at the end of the bar, presumably showing ESPN 9 ̆ 2 s Sportscenter or one its many imitators, as the cause of the demise of the sportswriter 9 ̆ 2 s importance in creating and chronicling the characters of the game. Deford is widely lauded as a great sportswriter, one who has appeared as a regular commentator on NPR, ESPN, and HBO, so it seems somewhat misplaced for him to assume the mantle of technology 9 ̆ 2 s victim on behalf of his colleagues. However, that is but one minor quibble, since the passage itself is so engrossing you forgive the possible transparency. The book 9 ̆ 2 s other pitfall is the often brutal coarseness with which many characters regard and act toward women. Deford might be attempting to hold a mirror to the sport to urge improvement via self-actualization, but more often than not the scenes depicting sexual situations seem salacious rather than sermonic. The tale ends with the reader left having to fill in some gaps in the intervening timeline, but the devil is not in the details here. One might wish that the ending did not come so quickly, craving juicy tidbits of what transpired from point A to point B. But with Deford having provided two such richly drawn characters as Traveler and Alcazar, one can easily imagine how each would have acted in the interim...|$|R
