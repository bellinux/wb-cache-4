50|$|Alaska has {{witnessed}} a steady increase {{of cases of}} botulism since 1985. It has more cases of botulism {{than any other state}} in the United States of America. This is caused by the traditional Eskimo practice of allowing animal products such as whole fish, fish heads, walrus, sea lion, and whale flippers, beaver <b>tails,</b> <b>seal</b> oil, and birds, to ferment {{for an extended period of}} time before being consumed. The risk is exacerbated when a plastic container is used for this purpose instead of the old-fashioned, traditional method, a grass-lined hole, as the Clostridium botulinum bacteria thrive in the anaerobic conditions created by the air-tight enclosure in plastic.|$|R

5000|$|The Jinchuriki (lit. [...] "Power of Human Sacrifice"), {{or simply}} hosts, are humans {{who have had}} a <b>Tailed</b> Beast <b>sealed</b> into their bodies. When the ninja villages were established, seeing the {{potential}} of a Tailed Beast's power focused by a human element, Jinchuriki were utilized to have an advantage over their rivals. However, due to the destruction they can cause if the Tailed Beasts take control and destroy everything around them, those who become Jinchiriki are seen are tools rather people with some becoming outcasts.|$|R
5000|$|Each of {{the hosts}} {{appear to have}} a {{physical}} characteristic that resembles their beast; Naruto has fox-like whisker-marks on his face, while Gaara has tanuki-like rings around his eyes. Other than them and Killer Bee, the most recent Jinchūriki of the other Tailed Beasts include Yugito Nii (...) , the Fourth Mizukage Yagura (...) , Rōshi (...) , Han (...) , the rogue ninja Utakata (...) , and Fū (...) [...] Fū and Han are both captured and killed by Akatsuki during Part I, while the other four meet the same fate throughout Part II of the story. Their corpses are later altered by Obito to become his personal Six Paths of Pain and with their former <b>Tailed</b> Beasts <b>sealed</b> back inside of them.|$|R

It is {{generally}} depicted as half terrestrial {{animal in the}} frontal part (stag, deer, crocodile, or elephant) and half aquatic animal in the hind part (usually a fish or <b>seal</b> <b>tail,</b> though sometimes a peacock or even a floral tail is depicted.) Makara take many different forms throughout Asia. In Hindu astrology, Makara {{is equivalent to the}} sign of Capricorn, tenth of the twelve symbols of the Zodiac.|$|R

Eventually, only Kurama and Gyuki remain to be {{captured}} after the five Kage's refusal to hand their hosts, Naruto and Killer Bee respectively, to Obito, leading to the Fourth Great Ninja War. During the war, {{with the help of}} Kabuto, Obito reanimates the former hosts as his personal Six Paths of Pain and <b>seals</b> the <b>Tailed</b> Beasts back within them in an attempt to capture Naruto and Killer Bee, though Naruto's determination to save the Tailed Beasts surprises and amazes them as Kurama realizes that he must be the person that the Sage told them long ago.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{aerodynamic}} investigations {{were conducted}} on a sting mounted 0. 0405 -scale representation of the - 140 A/B inner mold line (IML) space shuttle orbiter in 7. 75 x 11 foot low speed wind tunnel, during the time period from 18 March 1974 to 20 March 1974. The primary test objectives were to establish basic longitudinal and lateral-directional stability and control characteristics for the IML orbiter. Additional configurations investigated were sealed elevon hingeline gaps, sealed rudder split line and hingeline gaps, larger radius leading edge on the vertical <b>tail,</b> and <b>sealed</b> speedbrake base. Aerodynamic force and moment data for the orbiter were measured in the body-axis system by an internally mounted, six-component strain gage balance. The model was sting mounted with the center of rotation located at approximately the wing trailing edge. The nominal angle of attack range was from - 4 to + 30 degrees. Yaw polars were recorded over a nominal yaw angle range from - 14 to + 14 degrees at constant angles of attack of 0, + or - 5, 10, 15 and 20 degrees...|$|R

The developing of new sealing jutsus was continued by the Uzumaki Clan, a branch of Senju Clan who are descendants of the sage; among their works is a jutsu that <b>seals</b> <b>Tailed</b> Beasts into their Jinchuriki to be. The most common application of this is sealing weapons or other objects within scrolls to efficiently carry {{a large number of}} items. Sealing jutsu are also utilized to restrict access to things, such as chakra or entry to a building. The [...] "Reaper Death Seal" [...] is a unique sealing jutsu as the target's soul is sealed with the Reaper, who is neither living nor an object.|$|R
50|$|In this version, the {{gap between}} fantasy and reality is finally bridged. The {{creature}} is realized, suggesting its implication from symbolic to subsistence. Giving the creature a realistic form, somewhat detaches it from the folklore, making it even more independent and less enigmatic. The sculpture though realistic is nonetheless inanimate. It does however, provide intimate suggestions of what {{it could have been}} if it was truly alive. Combined with the head of a lion, a mane similar to a pangolin’s scales, the body of a <b>seal,</b> <b>tail</b> of a shark and patterns from a whale, Singa Merlionus is a mammal designed to glide in the water and still survive on land. This is inspired by the latest folklores being promoted where it is supposed to come up to rest on Sentosa now and then.|$|R
5000|$|FaroA Mer boy who is {{the first}} to show Sapphy the world of Ingo. He is {{described}} as having dark hair, brown eyes, perfectly white teeth, and suntanned skin. He is offended when Sapphire calls him a mermaid ("do you go to school with a lot of nice maids?"). Sapphire compares his tail to that of a seal, however on the covers of the novels it looks as if he has a <b>seal's</b> <b>tail</b> with a whale's fins. He is intensely proud of being Mer, however he later learns that he also has human blood in him. He always hints (or hopes) that Sapphire may become Mer, and while he calls her his sister, it is unknown whether he feels a romantic or brotherly love towards her. He is also Saldowr's apprentice and protects him with his heart and soul. Always wears a matching deublek to Sapphires. He likes to tease, and calls Sapphire [...] "Little Sister".|$|R
5000|$|Takigakure (lit. [...] "Village Hidden in Waterfall") is a ninja village {{situated}} in an unnamed country. It {{has yet to}} be explored much in the series, though the anime depicts the village being built around a giant tree with many waterfalls scattered around, which gave the village their name. Despite being surrounded by four countries (two of which are Great Shinobi Nations), it has never been invaded, a feat which they frequently boast for. Takigakure is the only ninja village of a non-Shinobi Nation to be in possession of a Tailed Beast: Chōmei, the Seven <b>Tails,</b> who was <b>sealed</b> in Fū. The village is led by Shibuki, who provided care for Fū. However, she {{became one of the first}} Jinchuriki to be captured by Akatsuki. The only other ninja known from Takigakure is Kakuzu, who defected from the village after a failure of certain mission and stole the Earth Grudge technique, before joining Akatsuki.|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 125 The cost of high {{pressure}} gland water and increasing environmental concerns {{have made the}} use of flushless mechanical seals attractive in many slurry applications. One such application exists at Syncrude Canada Lts (SCL). SCL is a large scale mining operation that extracts crude oil from tar sand. The by product of the process, 150 degrees F sand and water tailings, is pumped to remove storage sites. Tailings pumps are staged in series {{to reduce the number}} of pump stations. As a result, tailing line pressures can reach 300 psig. Recently, SCL expanded their tailings storage by adding a new remote site. Due to the high cost of installing and maintaining a gland water line, the decision was made to use flushless mechanical seals in place of packing. At the time of the expansion a large slurry seal capable of handling the {{high pressure}} tailings was not available; however, one seal manufacturer had a prototype seal design that had potential. This seal was chosen with the thought that it could be developed and refined to provide consistent 200 hr life. Having made the decision to use mechanical seals, the pipeline system was designed with the mechanical seal requirements in mind. Shortly after startup of the new <b>tailing</b> lines, <b>seals</b> began to fail. With the line now in operation, it was necessary to quickly resolve the problems. An intensive effort was launched to determine why seals were failing. Initial investigation showed the process, controls, and new equipment were working properly. The failures appeared to be seal relation. Over the next months, joint work conducted by SCL and the seal manufacturer identified a range of seal problems and interim measures were implemented to increase seal life. As a result of this work, an improved seal design was achieved. Extensive lab and field testing of the improved seal has proved its performance in this aggressive service. Active seals now average 3000 hr, with some seals having a life of over 6000 hr...|$|R

Intoxicated Circus maroons Ondine at Roancarrig Lighthouse island because he thinks she will haunt him forever, as humans and selkies don't belong together. Dusk comes and some {{driftwood}} gives Ondine's basking shilouette the appearance of a <b>seal's</b> <b>tail,</b> she jumps into the sea towards the seals on Seal Rock. The priest wakes up a depressed Circus, and he brings Annie from hospital to his home. She comforts him saying Ondine will be back because she left something behind. Annie watches TV with Sigur Rós performing, Circus recognizes they are the songs of Ondine, and goes back to find her on Seal Rock to demand the truth. Ondine gives one version that she is a sea creature that found her seal coat and buried it so she can stay with a family she loves. She then explains that she is a drug mule from Romania, and her pushta Vladic (Emil Hostina) was evading the Coast Guards, when she swam away with the backpack of heroin since Vladic can't swim. She floated in the sea until Circus saved her.|$|R

Until one day, he accidentally releases a gumiho (Shin Min-ah), a legendary fox with nine <b>tails</b> who was <b>sealed</b> inside a painting by Samshin Grandmother (三神). Fleeing the scene, Dae-woong suffers a life-threatening fall and is only saved by the gumiho giving him her [...] "fox bead" [...] (여우 구슬). When Dae-woong awakes and meets a mysterious pretty girl, he initially treats her as eccentric or mentally ill, before finally understanding {{that she is a}} gumiho in human form. According to myth, gumihos eat men's livers, so Dae-woong is scared out of his wits, and the gumiho takes advantage of his fear by sticking by his side. He names her [...] "Mi-ho," [...] and keeps her happy by buying her beef and hiding her true identity. Mi-ho wants nothing more than to become human, so they strike a deal: she'll lend him her mystical fox bead so that with his increased speed and strength, he'll be able to do difficult stunts, and in exchange he'll help her become human. As time passes, they {{get to know each other}} better and Dae-woong is charmed by how Mi-ho looks at the world with childlike wonder.|$|R
5000|$|Brazilian three-banded {{armadillos}} have a head-and-body {{length of}} about 22 to 27 cm and the tail is between 6 and 8 cm long. They weigh 1 - 1.6 kg. The armor {{is composed of}} ossified dermal scutes covered by nonoverlapping, keratinized epidermal scales, which are connected by flexible bands of skin. This armor covers the back, sides, head, tail, ears, and outside surfaces of the legs. The underside {{of the body and}} the inner surfaces of the legs have no armored protection, and are covered instead by long, coarse hair. The genus Tolypeutes, which includes both the Brazilian and southern species of three-banded armadillos, is unique in the ability to roll up in a tight, almost impenetrable ball. This is because their armor is slightly looser than that of other armadillo genera, which allows for greater freedom of movement. The loose armor also creates a layer of air between the shell and the body, which insulates the animal. This higher capacity for thermoregulation allows them to survive in climates too arid for some of the other armadillo species. When the armadillo rolls into a defensive ball, the ears are tucked into the shell and the head and <b>tail</b> interlock to <b>seal</b> the shell completely. The teeth are soft and peg-like, adapted solely for smashing the exoskeletons of insects.|$|R
5000|$|The next day, Conor leaves {{again for}} the cove after their mother has left for work. Searching {{for him at the}} cove, Sapphy hears a {{beautiful}} voice singing a familiar song that her father had sung to her in the past. She calls out for her father and the singing stops. Suddenly she notices a boy perched on a rock. At first she thinks he is wearing a wetsuit pulled down to the waist but later realises that he actually has a <b>seal's</b> <b>tail</b> instead of legs. She nearly falls into the sea but the Mer boy, named Faro helps her keep her balance. When she calls him a [...] "mermaid", he gets very scornful of humans, saying that him being a mermaid is [...] "anatomically impossible" [...] as he is, firstly, male and secondly, [...] "all that scaly-tails and hair-combing mermaid and merboy and merman stuff comes from humans". He takes her through the Skin (the surface) and into the world of Ingo which is extremely painful at the beginning for a human, and you have to forget about Air to be able to survive. She also finds out that it works the other way for the Mer: it hurts them when they go into the Air, and if they stay to long, they will die. After an amazing time, Sapphy leaves Ingo only to realize that she has been there all day long instead of a few hours.|$|R
5000|$|The Shinju (lit. Divine Tree) was a {{tree that}} legends {{referred}} to as the creator of the world, which bears chakra-rich fruit once a millennia that humanity is warned not to eat as that person would {{become a part of the}} entity. However, a princess named Kaguya Ōtsutsuki defied the taboo in her desire for peace. This ultimately led to her eventual madness as she enacts the first Infinite Tsukiyomi to assimilate all life into the Shinju, turning the assimilated humans into creatures called White Zetsu. But when Kaguya learns that some of her chakra was transferred into her children, she became enraged and fused into the Shinju to transform it into the Ten-Tails (...) to reclaim her chakra. As a living weapon of mass destruction that acts on Kaguya's rage and base instincts, the Ten-Tails is able to terraform areas with its attacks, generate multiple natural disasters at once, and spawn what is later revealed to assimilated life forms from its body. Being the progenitor of chakra within every ninja, the Ten-Tails is also able to use attacks and projectiles based on Yin-YangStyle (Omyōton) which can negate all chakra-based ninjutsu except Sage chakra. Due to the dangers the rampaging Ten-Tails poses to the world, Hagoromo and Hamura sealed their mother with the former becoming the first Jinchuriki. But as his death would undo the seal on the monster, Hagoromo separated the Ten-Tails's chakra from its body and scattered it into the four winds as the <b>Tailed</b> Beasts before <b>sealing</b> the body away in what would become the moon.|$|R
