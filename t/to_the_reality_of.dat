5|$|Like other Jacobin novels, The Wrongs of Woman {{relies on}} a web of suggestive {{character}} names to convey its message: Jemima is named for Job's daughter; Henry Darnford's name resembles that of Henry Darnley, the second husband of Mary, Queen of Scots; and George Venables shares a name with the notorious womanizer George, Prince of Wales. Wollstonecraft added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> her philosophical text by quoting from familiar literature, such as Shakespeare, alluding to important historical events, and referencing relevant facts. The Wrongs of Woman comments {{on the state of}} women in society by rewriting earlier texts with a feminist slant, such as Henry Fielding's Tom Jones; Fielding's Mrs. Fitzpatrick becomes Wollstonecraft's Maria. These rhetorical strategies made the philosophical elements of the novel more palatable to the public.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenery and}} {{background}} of the story was meticulously copied from existing sources; car model types like the Opel Olympia 38 in which Calculus' abductors escaped the police were drawn from real examples, while Hergé closely adhered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> the port and docks at Saint-Nazaire. Professor Tarragon's house was drawn from a real house in Avenue Delleur, Boitsfort, which Jacobs had identified for Hergé's purposes. Hergé and Jacobs stationed themselves outside the house and completed a sketch of the building. Immediately after, two grey cars containing German soldiers pulled up; {{the house had been}} requisitioned by the Schutzstaffel (SS). Hergé realised that, had he and Jacobs been discovered sketching, they would have been interrogated.|$|E

50|$|Darryl Walker (Damon Wayans) is {{a clumsy}} nerdy repairman, {{who is a}} genius and Batman fan. Darryl has a pure heart and an optimistic Pollyannish personality. He is childishly naive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> living in an inner city neighborhood. The area suffers from {{political}} corruption and the police are on strike.

25|$|Besides higher {{employment}} and living standards, {{the first two}} years of economic revival seemed to offer a break in the cycle of rising rural violence. The flow of displaced peasants from the Sierra eased, and a good many peasants began to return to the countryside. That reverse might be explained by García's initial efforts to reduce reliance on military force to combat the guerrillas and thereby to lessen the degree of two-way violence driving people out of their villages. But the trend may also have been a response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> better economic conditions and earning possibilities in the agricultural sector.|$|E
25|$|Parker’s West Roxbury church {{remained}} loyal. Sermons {{and media}} attacked him, however, when he denied Biblical miracles and the literal {{authority of the}} Bible and Jesus. Many questioned his Christianity. Nearly all the pulpits in the Boston area were closed to him, and he lost friends. Parker reacted with grief and defiance. He remained unwilling to concede that his views placed him beyond the outer bounds of Unitarian liberalism. After this unwilling break with the Unitarian establishment, he spent two years (1841-1843) adjusting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> his newly controversial and independent career and increasing his social activism on religious grounds. He began to see himself as a prophetic religious reformer.|$|E
25|$|Instead of recalling {{something}} related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> {{the spoken}} word, calligraphy for the Muslim is a visible expression of spiritual concepts. Calligraphy has arguably {{become the most}} venerated form of Islamic art because it provides {{a link between the}} languages of the Muslims with the religion of Islam. The holy book of Islam, al-Qur'ān, has played a vital {{role in the development of}} the Arabic language, and by extension, calligraphy in the Arabic alphabet. Proverbs and complete passages from the Qur'an are still active sources for Islamic calligraphy. Contemporary artists in the Islamic world draw on the heritage of calligraphy to use calligraphic inscriptions or abstractions in their work.|$|E

This commentary draws on the research article by Moeeni and colleagues, as an exemplary work which has not adapted measures of two key economic determinants of fertility behavior, namely gender inequality and opportunity costs <b>of</b> childbearing, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> Iran’s economy.

25|$|Skeptics such as Paul Edwards have {{analyzed}} many {{of these}} accounts, and called them anecdotal, while also suggesting that claims of evidence for reincarnation originate from selective thinking and from the false memories that often result from one's own belief system and basic fears, and thus cannot be counted as empirical evidence. Carl Sagan referred to examples apparently from Stevenson's investigations in his book The Demon-Haunted World {{as an example of}} carefully collected empirical data, though he rejected reincarnation as a parsimonious explanation for the stories. Sam Harris cited Stevenson's works in his book The End of Faith as part of a body of data that seems to attest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> psychic phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Leaving aside any {{question}} as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> supernatural events as such, the primary {{doubts about the}} historicity of Juan Diego (and the Guadalupe event itself) arise from the silence of those major sources who {{would be expected to}} have mentioned him, including, in particular, Bishop Juan de Zumárraga and the earliest ecclesiastical historians who reported the spread of the Catholic faith among the Indians in the early decades after the capture of Tenochtítlan in 1521. Despite references in near-contemporary sources which do attest a mid-16th-century Marian cult attached to a miraculous image of the Virgin at a shrine at Tepeyac under the title of Our Lady of Guadalupe, and despite the weight of oral tradition concerning Juan Diego and the apparitions (which, at the most, spans less than four generations before being reduced to writing), the fundamental objection of this silence of core 16th-century sources remains a perplexing feature {{of the history of the}} cult which has, nevertheless, continued to grow outside Mexico and the Americas. The first writer to address this problem of the silence of the sources was Francisco de Florencia in chapter 12 of his book Estrella de el norte de Mexico (see previous section). However, it was not until 1794 that the argument from silence was presented to the public in detail by someone – Juan Bautista Muñoz – who clearly did not believe in the historicity of Juan Diego or of the apparitions. Substantially the same argument was publicized in updated form at the end of the 19th and 20th centuries in reaction to renewed steps taken by the ecclesiastical authorities to defend and promote the cult through the coronation of the Virgin in 1895 and the beatification of Juan Diego in 1990.|$|E
500|$|Another {{reason he}} had {{attributed}} the shooting to Israel, he wrote, was that [...] "the image corresponded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> the situation {{not only in}} Gaza {{but also in the}} West Bank." [...] Citing Ben Kaspi in the Israeli newspaper Maariv, he wrote that, during the first months of the Second Intifada, the IDF had fired one million rounds of ammunition—700,000 in the West Bank and 300,000 in Gaza; from 29 September to late October 2000, 118 Palestinians had been killed, including 33 under the age of 18, compared to 11 adult Israelis killed during the same period.|$|E

500|$|Chellas [...] "had {{this great}} idea, this {{elliptical}} thing, which we really loaded up with cues {{so that you}} would know at the end that Don was too late. Seeing Joan in there, taking the necklace off, and Joan's mother taking Don's hat into the room where Joan was, and then Joan putting on the green robe and coming out, seeing that behind-the-scenes moment the second time really cemented it." [...] Weiner said this allowed them to [...] "show Joan going through with it 24 hours beforehand, and then show Don giving this pitch that the audience is convinced is a great pitch. Then you slowly dissolve back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> Don coming in [...] pretty happy, Joan asking how it went, and Roger having this dead response—'it {{was one of his}} good ones'—and Don wondering why Joan's not more excited." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Robinson and Robb Buono, the film's {{production}} designer, {{decided that}} the script was composed of two distinct parts— {{the reality of the}} teens' lives and the time they spent at the skating rink. According to Buono, [...] "we wanted to look at it [...] through rose colored glasses, because when you think back on your memories of that time period— no matter what age you are— you see everything bigger. Our goal was to make that roller skating rink a character that grows as we keep coming back, and each time it’s more magical— a Saturday Night Fever-like contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> life.” Robinson and Buono chose to shoot at the Cascade Family Skating Rink in Atlanta after visiting and witnessing the energy and excitement of the rink. However, the filmmakers felt Cascade's interior design was too bland and decided it should be redesigned.|$|E
500|$|In particular, Fodor {{criticizes the}} instrumentalism of Daniel Dennett. Dennett {{maintains}} {{that it is}} possible to be realist with regard to intentional states without having to commit oneself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> mental representations. Now, according to Fodor, if one remains at this level of analysis, then there is no possibility of explaining why the intentional strategy works:There is ... a standard objection to instrumentalism ...: it is difficult to explain why the psychology of beliefs/desires works so well, if the psychology of beliefs/desires is, in fact, false.... As Putnam, Boyd and others have emphasized, from the predictive successes of a theory to the truth of that theory there is surely a presumed inference; and this is even more likely when ... we are dealing with the only theory in play which is predictively crowned with success. It is not obvious ... why such a presumption should not militate in favour of a realist conception ... of the interpretations of beliefs/desires.|$|E

500|$|Similarly, The Illustrated London News {{concluded}} that the production was a success and that the plot, though slight, served as a good vehicle for Gilbert's [...] "caustic humour and quaint satire". It {{found that there was}} [...] "much to call forth hearty laughter in the occasional satirical hits.... Dr. Sullivan's music is as lively as the text to which it is set, with here and there a touch of sentimental expression... The piece is well performed throughout." [...] The Daily News, The Globe, The Times (which particularly praised Grossmith, Barrington and Everard) and The Standard concurred, the last commenting favourably on the chorus acting, which, it said, [...] "adds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> the illusion". The Times also noted that the piece was an early attempt at the establishment of a [...] "national musical stage" [...] with a libretto free from risqué French [...] "improprieties" [...] and without the [...] "aid" [...] of Italian and German musical models.|$|E
500|$|Unprepared by what {{historian}} Max Nettlau {{called the}} [...] "explosive imminence" [...] of the First World War at its outbreak in August 1914, anarchists resigned themselves <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> the situation and, after a time, began themselves to take sides. Like all nationals, the anarchists had been conditioned {{to react to}} the political interests of their nations, whose influence left few unaffected. On the climate of the time, Nettlau remarked: [...] "The air was saturated with accepted nations, conventional opinions and the peculiar illusions which people entertained concerning small nationalities and the virtues and defects of certain races. There were all sorts of plausible justifications for imperialism, for financial controls and so on. And, since Tolstoy had been dead since 1910, no voice of libertarian and moral power was heard in the world: no organisation, large or small, spoke up." [...] European anarchist activity was restricted both physically and by the internal divisions within the anarchist movement over attitudes towards the war.|$|E
500|$|The {{other half}} of the army fared worse: lacking guides with local knowledge, it lost many men to hunger and thirst in its wanderings through the deserted borderlands, before {{reaching}} the fertile plains of Cappadocia around Caesarea. After looting the area, they turned south and made for Syria. On their way, they were encountered by a Byzantine force of 12,000, which swiftly called in reinforcements. The Byzantines then attacked at night, defeating the Abbasid army and recovering its loot. The surviving Abbasid troops scattered, with some following one of their leaders, Radad, to Malatya, and some 5,000 under Malik ibn Tawq finding refuge in Qaliqala. It was from the latter group that the Zuqnin chronicler drew his information. The campaign {{is one of the few}} such border raids to be known in detail, and, as the Islamic historian Hugh N. Kennedy comments, [...] "We probably get much closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> frontier warfare, with its confusions, hardships and failures, in this account than in the brief and sanitised versions provided by the Arabic historians." ...|$|E
