5|$|It {{is likely}} that the long journey and the siege had a {{detrimental}} effect on the Sultan's health. His death meant that any advances were postponed as the Grand Vizier had to return to Constantinople for the succession of the new Sultan, Selim II.

5|$|Luciferin-luciferase {{reactions}} {{are not the}} only way that organisms produce light. The parchment worm Chaetopterus (a marine Polychaete) makes use of another photoprotein, aequorin, instead of luciferase. When calcium ions are added, the aequorin's rapid catalysis creates a brief flash quite unlike <b>the</b> <b>prolonged</b> glow produced by luciferase. In a second, much slower, step luciferin is regenerated from the oxidised (oxyluciferin) form, allowing it to recombine with aequorin, in readiness for a subsequent flash. Photoproteins are thus enzymes, but with unusual reaction kinetics.|$|E

Genital piercings can be among the quicker to heal, with piercings of the clitoral hood and Prince Albert piercings healing in as little as a month, though some may take longer. Navel piercings can be the slowest to heal, with one source reporting a range of six months to two full years. <b>The</b> <b>prolonged</b> healing of navel piercings may be connected to clothing friction.|$|E
5|$|The {{petrogenesis}} of Lastarria rocks, {{like those}} of other volcanoes in the Central Volcanic Zone, involves <b>the</b> <b>prolonged</b> interaction with crustal rocks in magma chambers {{as well as the}} fractionation of certain minerals.

Finally, the mixing of magma chamber contents with new and more mafic magma shortly before each eruption {{played an important role in}} rock genesis. In the case of Lastarria, this mixing occurs in a stratified magma chamber, with active convection occurring between lighter and colder upper contents and hotter and denser lower contents.|$|E
