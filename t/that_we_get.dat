To address these concerns, A Risk Assessment Study of potential health risks of recycled water and comparisons to conventional Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Product (PPCP) exposures was conducted by the WateReuse Research Foundation. For each of four scenarios in which people {{come into contact with}} recycled water used for irrigation - children on the playground, golfers, and landscape, and agricultural workers - the findings from the study indicate that it could take anywhere from a few years to millions of years of exposure to nonpotable recycled water to reach the same exposure to PPCPs <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> in a single day through routine activities.|$|E
25|$|This {{distribution}} can {{be illustrated}} as an urn model with bias. Assume, for example, that an urn contains m1 red balls and m2 white balls, totalling N = m1 + m2 balls. Each red ball has the weight ω1 and each white ball has the weight ω2. We {{will say that}} the odds ratio is ω = ω1 / ω2. Now we are taking n balls, one by one, {{in such a way that}} the probability of taking a particular ball at a particular draw is equal to its proportion of the total weight of all balls that lie in the urn at that moment. The number of red balls x1 <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> in this experiment is a random variable with Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution.|$|E

25|$|The second great {{influence}} on Bracton's thinking was William Raleigh, {{also known as}} William de Raley, a native of Devon. He was a resident in and around Bratton Fleming in 1212, when Bracton was born there. Raleigh was a justice of the bench in 1228. In 1234 he pronounced reversal judgment of Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent's outlawry. Though {{he was not a}} justicier, he was regarded as the chief among judges. In 1237 he was appointed treasurer of Exeter Cathedral. He was elected to the See of Winchester in 1238 and passed from legal history. His election to this position was violently opposed by the King who favoured William of Valence. In 1239 Raleigh was elected to the See of Norwich. In 1244 {{he was elected to the}} See of Winchester for a second time. He died in 1250. He had much to do with the passage of the Statute of Merton. Raleigh defended the refusal of the barons to change the law of bastardy and legitimation. He invented the writ Quare ejecit infra terminum and was influential in the writing of several other novel writs. It is from Bracton <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> the majority of the history of the law at this time. Bracton is thought to have had a notebook with 2000 cases from Pateshull and Raleigh.|$|E

[...] The pair did not show the prospectus to anyone at Stern, but instead presented it to Gruner + Jahr's deputy managing director, Dr Jan Hensmann, and Manfred Fischer; they also requested a 200,000mark deposit from the publisher to secure the rights with Kujau. After a meeting that lasted {{a little over two}} hours, and with no recourse to an expert or historian, the deposit was authorised. As soon as the meeting ended, at about 7pm, Heidemann travelled to Stuttgart, with the deposit money, to meet Kujau.|$|E

Nonetheless, he was reappointed as Minister of Finance on 23 September, as part of the Tsipras' second cabinet. Chouliarakis, the interim Minister of Finance, was retained in the finance ministry as an Alternate Minister of Finance. Later in September, {{in an interview with the}} Financial Times, Tsakalotos said that it was [...] "absolutely critical <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> something on debt relief." [...] He added: [...] "By the second quarter of 2016, if we get a positive review, bank recapitalisation and debt relief, I don’t see any reason why there shouldn’t be a return to growth." [...] He also said that the new government would make serious attempts to crack down on tax evasion: [...] "It will be a central aspect of our policies, which will determine the success of the government, because it’s the only way the Greek people will accept difficult measures that show we’re all in the same boat." ...|$|E
500|$|Heller was {{responsible}} for writing the episode's voice-over, despite his dislike of the task. He said that despite it being his [...] "400th version," [...] he was [...] "still not happy with it." [...] He believed that an early scene in which spoils are distributed from a cart in front of Pompey represented the first real sense of how the series would depict city life. He said, [...] "I {{think this is the}} first time <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> sense of the version of Rome that the show is pushing," [...] which was a very different version than viewers may have been used to. To him, Rome was [...] "colorful and painted" [...] and cosmopolitan. A later scene featuring Cicero the Younger in the Senate proved difficult to film because of the large number of Italian extras who did not speak English. In the DVD audio commentary, he said that [...] "this is one of those scenes where you need really great assistant directors, because all of these Italian extras who have no idea whatsoever what [...] saying, so to keep them interested and focused and concentrated on what's going on is a real trick." ...|$|E

[...] Performances feature backdrops including, among other settings, a game show set and a cemetery. Bruce stated, [...] "We always have a different set, not only for Hallowicked but every tour we go out on. We've been around so long <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to dig up the many cool sets that we used {{back in the day}} and then get to use them again on a national level.

500|$|On 16 October 2009, Wilders {{arrived in}} the United Kingdom and was quickly forced to move his press conference due to protests by about forty members of the {{organization}} Islam4UK, an organization that was later shut down under the UK's Terrorism Act 2000 on 14 January 2010. Though the Home Office had asserted that his entry into the country would not be blocked, a spokesman said his [...] "statements and behaviour during a visit will inevitably impact on any future decisions to admit him." [...] His visit to the UK met with protest, but Wilders called it [...] "a victory" [...] in a press conference. On his outspoken views on Islam, he said: [...] "I {{have a problem with the}} Islamic ideology, the Islamic culture, because I feel that the more Islam <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> in our societies the less freedom we get." [...] He opened the press conference with a quote from George Orwell's preface to Animal Farm: [...] "If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they don't want to hear". Lord Pearson, who had invited him, said his arrival was [...] "a celebration of the victory of freedom of speech over those who would prevent it in this country, particularly the Islamists, the violent Jihadists who are on the march across the world and in the UK." ...|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, {{a change}} {{occurred}} in Susan's personality. During the surrogacy storyline, viewers saw Susan become the [...] "mother-in-law from hell". Woodbune {{said that it was}} challenging trying to change the character of Susan. During clashes with her son-in-law Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker), Susan was seen becoming controlling and bossy. Woodburne said [...] "As the story progressed it became apparent {{that we were going to}} have to go to the extremes of the less attractive qualities of our characters. We talked about it and decided to go for it – he would be the overbearing husband and Susan the mother-in-law from hell". Woodburne added that Susan is acting out of love for her daughter and for Libby's desire to have a child. In July 2011, Woodburne told a writer for Channel 5 that she still found the role of Susan challenging. She explained that she likes Susan because she adapts well and takes all the things that happen to her in her stride. Woodburne said Karl and Susan are now less naive and exuberant due to the things they have gone through. When asked what the future holds for her character, Woodburne stated [...] "You know, I'm kind of with Susan. I like the Kennedy house when it's full of noisy kids, being naughty and creating havoc. I like it loud and messy. So that would be my hope, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> a bit of that happening again." ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "Sunshine Days" [...] was mixed. Aaron Kinney from Salon {{magazine was}} critical of the producers' idea to air the entry as the penultimate episode {{leading up to the}} heavily-promoted series finale. Kinney pointed out that the episode {{had little to do with}} the show's overarching storyline, but it was nevertheless touted as part of The X-Files [...] "Endgame" [...] promotion strategy. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a [...] "C" [...] grade. She sarcastically wrote, [...] "nine years of mytharc to start to wrap up. And so the penultimate episode of The X-Files, naturally, is devoted to The Brady Bunch." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that the episode [...] "is not one of Gilligan's very best stories", citing issues with its tone and its characterization of Oliver Martin. The two, however, did praise Gilligan's humanized style, writing, [...] "he gives Scully the proof of the paranormal she's been needing" [...] but shows that the most important [...] "things to care about in life" [...] are [...] "humans". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it a 7 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this was a pleasant yet bittersweet episode, one that leaves the characters in relative peace. It is the first time <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> a glimpse of what the writers are thinking as the series comes to a close. Now all that's left is the mythology, which I can only hope will end on a similarly pleasant note." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, said that [...] "the central story falls a bit flat", but the episode worked well as a [...] "paean to medium of television itself" [...] and he felt it was an appropriate vehicle for the series' penultimate installment.|$|E
