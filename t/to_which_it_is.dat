5|$|A Sea Symphony (1910), {{the only}} one of the series to include a part for full choir, differs from most earlier choral symphonies in that the choir sings in all the movements. The extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a true symphony has been debated; in a 2013 study, Alain Frogley {{describes}} it as a hybrid work, with elements of symphony, oratorio and cantata. Its sheer length—about eighty minutes—was unprecedented for an English symphonic work, and within its thoroughly tonal construction it contains harmonic dissonances that pre-echo the early works of Stravinsky which were soon to follow.|$|E
5|$|Fossils {{from the}} Pleistocene {{suggest that this}} species bred further south in Europe in the cool periods between glaciations than it does now. Its {{sensitivity}} to changing climate {{as well as to}} water table levels and the speed of vegetation growth has led to suggestions that its range is affected by global warming, and the ruff might act as an indicator species for monitoring climate change. Potential threats to this species may also include outbreaks of diseases <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> susceptible such as influenza, botulism and avian malaria.|$|E
5|$|Harmless and docile, the thornback {{guitarfish}} can {{be readily}} approached underwater, and fares well in public aquariums. Off the United States, this ray is common and faces no substantial threats: it is only occasionally caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers, and has no economic value. As most of its range lies within US waters, the species has been assessed as Least Concern overall by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, in Mexican waters the thornback guitarfish population is small and fragmented, and the degree <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> affected by fishing is uncertain. There, the IUCN has listed it locally under Data Deficient while noting its susceptibility to inshore lagoon fisheries and shrimp trawlers, and {{the urgent need for}} additional information to ensure its long-term regional survival.|$|E

5|$|Internal parasites of {{the common}} loon include many species of worms, {{including}} flatworms, tapeworms, nematodes and spiny-headed worms. High levels of worms may result from feeding changes due to low availability of fish, {{and can lead to}} illness and death. Protozoal infections including one caused by Eimeria gaviae and avian malaria has been recorded in this loon. The black fly Simulium annulus is closely associated with the common loon <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> attracted to chemicals in the uropygial gland secretions as well as by visual and tactile cues. This fly is detrimental to loons, their preferred hosts, transmitting blood-borne parasites and viruses, and causing nest abandonment when numbers are high. External parasites include ischnoceran feather lice, although these are not found on the bird's head.|$|E
5|$|It interbreeds {{regularly}} and extensively with the mallard, <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> closely related. The female lays six to fourteen oval eggs, which have smooth shells {{and come in}} varied shades of white and buff green. Hatching takes 30 days on average. Incubation usually takes 25 to 26 days, with both sexes sharing duties, although the male usually defends the territory until the female reaches {{the middle of her}} incubation period. It takes about six weeks to fledge. Once the eggs hatch, the hen leads the brood to rearing areas with abundant invertebrates and vegetation.|$|E

In 1997, {{the rules of}} driving events in France were modified {{to take into account}} the speed of execution of the course, which made lighter, faster horses more competitive. The Norman Cob and the lighter type of Boulonnais were particularly affected. The Norman Cob's gaits, calm temperament and willingness to master technical movements make it an excellent competitor, and in 2011, more than a third of the horses represented in the French driving championships were Norman Cobs. Many Norman Cobs represent France in driving events at the international level.|$|E
5|$|The station {{consists}} of a central island platform between the tracks that are elevated on a railway embankment. There are four tracks through the site {{although there are no}} platforms for the c2c lines. The full length of the platform is covered by a single station canopy with a central waiting room. The Art Deco red brick ticket office is located below platform level <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> connected by a subway and stairway. Although similar to the other single-storey station buildings on this part of the route, it is notable for its high atrium roof and polygonal shape. The floor is tiled with a reversed swastika pattern, a popular decorative design at the time the station was constructed. The station is listed as a building of local heritage interest by Havering London Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|Alone with Shuu, Ryouta finally remembers {{what he had}} {{forgotten}} due to the traumatic nature of the events: he recognizes the doctor {{as a man who}} promised to grant his wish for peace between birds and humans after he and the protagonist witnessed a human terrorist incident at a bird orphanage in which the protagonist's parents, crisis negotiators, were killed, and that the protagonist died when she visited him in the infirmary. It is revealed that she died by Charon virus after coming in contact with Ryouta, as Shuu had induced the virus into Ryouta's body though grafts from Nageki's remains for the purpose of using him to exterminate humanity—since there can be no more fighting between two factions if one is wiped out, this would grant Ryouta's wish. Shuu then remarks that Labor 9 was powered by the protagonist's now irreversibly damaged brain. A broken Ryouta submits to Shuu's offer of becoming a living weapon of mass destruction after these revelations, and a struggle ensues during which the protagonist's spirit intervenes. Ryouta then asks Shuu why he decided to grant his wish, <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> implied that Shuu's affection towards Ryouta's deceased father, Ryuuji, was greater than Shuu himself would like to admit, and that he was motivated by Ryuuji's dying request: to do something for his son.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, the tambalacoque, {{also known}} as the dodo tree, was thought to be dying out on Mauritius, <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> endemic. There were {{supposedly}} only 13 specimens left, all estimated to be about 300 years old. Stanley Temple hypothesised that it depended on the dodo for its propagation, and that its seeds would germinate only after passing through the bird's digestive tract. He claimed that the tambalacoque was now nearly coextinct because of the disappearance of the dodo. Temple overlooked reports from the 1940s that found that tambalacoque seeds germinated, albeit very rarely, without being abraded during digestion. Others have contested his hypothesis and suggested that the decline of the tree was exaggerated, or seeds were also distributed by other extinct animals such as Cylindraspis tortoises, fruit bats or the broad-billed parrot. According to Wendy Strahm and Anthony Cheke, two experts in the ecology of the Mascarene Islands, the tree, while rare, has germinated since the demise of the dodo and numbers several hundred, not 13 as claimed by Temple, hence discrediting Temple's view as to the dodo and the tree's sole survival relationship.|$|E
5|$|Whilst nineteenth- and to {{a lesser}} extent twentieth-century attitudes often {{suggested}} that any well-constructed pre-modern road surface must be Roman, late twentieth-century archaeologists were more open to evaluating the structure within the context of a wider span of historical periods. After an early allowance by Phillips in 1853 that the causeway could be British rather than Roman there was little further investigation of such a possibility. In 1994, the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England began a review of the date or origin for the Wheeldale causeway. Detailed air photography of the Cawthorn camps in 1999 site failed to find evidence of a road leading towards Wheeldale Moor from the camps <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> historically related, and the causeway does not obviously connect to the main Roman road network. Several writers around the turn of the millennium began to express doubt about the established narrative for the structure as a Roman road. Twenty-first century archaeologists then found several exemplars of other cambered, metalled roads that pre-date the Roman presence in Britain, and hence set precedence for the possibility of a pre-Roman origin for the Wheeldale causeway. Several sources from the mid-1990s onwards have suggested that the structure may be a pre-Roman (Iron Age) road of uncertain route or purpose.|$|E
