The models {{were derived from}} the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data collected at various wind turbines. The vibration of a wind turbine is characterized by two parameters, i. e., drivetrain and <b>tower</b> <b>acceleration.</b> An unsupervised data-mining algorithm, the k-means clustering algorithm, was applied to develop the first monitoring model. The other two monitoring models for detecting abnormal values of drivetrain and <b>tower</b> <b>acceleration</b> were developed by using {{the concept of a}} control chart. SCADA vibration data sampled at 10 s intervals reflects normal and faulty status of wind turbines.

40|$|To monitor {{wind turbine}} vibrations, normal {{behaviour}} models are built to predict <b>tower</b> top <b>accelerations</b> and drive-train vibrations. Signal deviations from model prediction are labelled as anomalies and are further investigated. In this paper we assess a stochastic approach {{to reconstruct the}} 1 Hz <b>tower</b> top <b>acceleration</b> signal, which was measured in a wind turbine located at the wind farm Alpha Ventus in the German North Sea. We compare the resulting data reconstruction {{with that of a}} model based on a neural network, which has been previously reported as a data-mining algorithm suitable for reconstructing this signal. Our results present evidence that the stochastic approach outperforms the neural network in the high frequency domain (1 Hz). Although neural network retrieves accurate step-forward predictions, with low mean square errors, the stochastic approach predictions better preserve the statistics and the frequency components of the original signal, retaining high accuracy levels. The implementation of our stochastic approach is available as open source code and can easily be adapted for other situations involving stochastic data reconstruction.

The wireless monitoring system installed is based on the use of a wireless sensor node developed at the University of Michigan termed Narada. Narada is a wireless data acquisition system specially designed for monitoring civil infrastructure systems where low power consumption (i.e., rechargeable battery operated), high data resolution (i.e., 16-bits or higher), and long communication ranges (i.e., 500 m or longer) are all required system capabilities. On the New Carquinez Suspension Bridge, a total of 33 Narada nodes each capable of collecting up to 4 independent channels of data were installed over a 2-year period with various sensing transducers interfaced: 23 tri-axial accelerometers (to measure deck and <b>tower</b> <b>accelerations),</b> 3 string potential meters (to measure longitudinal movement between the deck and the towers), 33 battery voltage detectors (to monitor the battery level on each Narada), 9 thermistors (to measure the ambient and girder temperatures), 2 wind vanes, 2 anemometers and 6 string gages(to measure deck bending strains). A total of 124 sensing channels have been deployed on the bridge. The Narada nodes are all powered by rechargeable batteries that are continuously charged by solar panels installed on the top deck of the bridge.|$|R

Controller input signals in all cases are rotor speed and axial <b>tower</b> top <b>acceleration.</b> Because of the nonlinear aerodynamics of a wind turbine, for each design some type of gain scheduling is required.

40|$|With the {{increase}} in size of wind turbines, there is increasing interest in exploiting the pitch control capability of variable speed turbines to alleviate tower fatigue loads. The most direct method is to modify the blade pitch angle {{in response to a}} measurement of <b>tower</b> <b>acceleration.</b> It is shown that the ap mode has a central role in determining whether this approach is effective since there is a strong interaction between the blade ap-wise mode and the tower fore-aft mode. Several different approaches to the design of the controller for the tower speed feedback loop are investigated. It is concluded that a reduction in the tower loads of up to 18 % is possible for multi-megawatt sized wind turbines...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a multiobjective optimization model of wind turbine performance. Three different objectives, wind power output, vibration of drive train, and vibration of tower, {{are used to}} evaluate the wind turbine performance. Neural network models are developed to capture dynamic equations modeling wind turbine performance. Due to the complexity and nonlinearity of these models, an evolutionary strategy algorithm is used to solve the multiobjective optimization problem. Data sets at two different frequencies, 10 s and 1 min, are used in this study. Computational results with the two data sets are reported. Analysis of these results points to a reduction of wind turbine vibrations potentially larger than the gains reported in the paper. This {{is due to the fact}} that vibrations may occur at frequencies higher than ones reflected in the 10 -s data collected according to the standard practice used in the wind industry.

40|$|Vibrations of a {{wind turbine}} have a {{negative}} impact on its performance and therefore approaches to effectively control turbine vibrations are sought by wind industry. The body of previous research on wind turbine vibrations has focused on physics-based models. Such models come with limitations as some ideal assumptions do not reflect reality. In this Thesis a data-driven approach to analyze the wind turbine vibrations is introduced. Improvements in the data collection of information system allow collection of large volumes of industrial process data. Although the sufficient information is contained in collected data, they cannot be fully utilized to solve the challenging industrial modeling issues. Data-mining is a novel science offers platform to identify models or recognize patterns from large data set. Various successful applications of data mining proved its capability in extracting models accurately describing the processes of interest. The vibrations of a wind turbine originate at various sources. This Thesis focuses on mitigating vibrations with wind turbine control. Data mining algorithms are utilized to construct vibration models of a wind turbine that are represented by two parameters, drive train acceleration and <b>tower</b> <b>acceleration.</b> An evolutionary strategy algorithm is employed to optimize the wind turbine performance expressed with three objectives, power generation, vibration of wind turbine drive train, and vibration of wind turbine tower.

40|$|Common {{industrial}} {{practice for}} designing floating wind turbines {{is to set}} an operational limit for the tower-top axial acceleration, normally {{in the range of}} 0. 2 – 0. 3 g, which is typically understood {{to be related to the}} safety of turbine components. This paper investigates the rationality of the tower-top acceleration limit by evaluating the correlation between acceleration and drivetrain responses. A 5 MW reference drivetrain is selected and modelled on a spar-type floating wind turbine in 320 m water depth. A range of environmental conditions are selected based on the long-term distribution of wind speed, significant wave height, and peak period from hindcast data for the Northern North Sea. For each condition, global analysis using an aero-hydro-servo-elastic tool is carried out for six one-hour realizations. The global analysis results provide useful information on their own — regarding the correlation between environmental condition and <b>tower</b> top <b>acceleration,</b> and correlation between <b>tower</b> top <b>acceleration</b> and other responses of interest — which are used as input in a decoupled analysis approach. The load effects and motions from the global analysis are applied on a detailed drivetrain model in a multi-body system (MBS) analysis tool. The local responses on bearings are then obtained from MBS analysis and post-processed for the correlation study. Although the maximum acceleration provides a good indication of the wave-induced loads, it is not seen to be a good predictor for significant fatigue damage on the main bearings in this case...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of abnormal behaviour in mechanical systems {{is key to}} anticipate and avoid their potential failure. Thus wind turbine health is commonly assessed monitoring series of $ 10 $-minute SCADA and high frequency data from sensors.

Signal deviations from model prediction are labelled as anomalies and are further investigated. More efficient models are expected to help enhancing the {{identification of}} abnormal behaviour. In this paper we assess a stochastic approach to reconstruct the $ 1 $ Hz <b>tower</b> top <b>acceleration</b> signal, which was measured in a wind turbine located at the wind farm Alpha Ventus in the German North Sea. We compare the resulting data reconstruction {{with that of a}} model based on a neural network, which has been previously reported as a data-mining algorithm suitable for reconstructing this signal. In order to focus the discussion on the similarities and differences of both approaches, we limit our evaluation to a single input-output system; in doing so, we avoid other differences, i. e. loading type, pre-processing or model complexity. Our results present evidence that the stochastic approach outperforms the neural network in the high frequency domain ($ 1 $ Hz). Although neural network retrieve accurate step-forward predictions, with low mean square errors, the stochastic approach predictions better preserve the statistics and the frequency components of the original signal, remaining high accuracy levels.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{continuous}} vibration measurements in 14 upwind wind turbines {{of the same}} model and belonging to the same wind farm have been conducted. The data were acquired over a period lasting approximately half a year. The <b>tower</b> axial vibration <b>acceleration</b> has been monitored in the frequency band from 0 to 10 Hz with an accelerometer mounted on the gearbox casing between the intermediate and the high-speed shafts. It has been observed that the average frequency spectrum {{is dominated by the}} blade passing frequency in all the wind turbines. The evolution of the vibration magnitudes over the entire range of operating conditions is also very similar for all the wind turbines. The root-meansquare (rms) acceleration value has been correlated with the wind speed, and it has been found that a linear fit with a positive slope is a useful model for prediction purposes.

40|$|AbstractModern {{state-of-the-art}} fatigue monitoring approaches gain {{in importance}} {{in the context of}} renewables such as wind power plants. Fatigue is of utmost importance in terms of potential damage mechanisms and in the perspective of scheduled plant lifetime periods of 20 years. A qualified fatigue monitoring approach considering the real loads provides-the best possible knowledge {{of the state of the}} plant (protection of investment) -the basis for long term operation projects and-the basis for a load ranking within a wind park in case of partial load operation. It is the aim to ensure a constant damage accumulation across the wind park. AREVA disposes of a long tradition in the development of fatigue and structural health monitoring solutions. The methodology established for power plant applications is transferred to mechanical loading conditions of components of wind energy plants. The core challenge is the identification and qualified processing of realistic load-time histories. The related methodological requirements will be explained in detail. In terms of components of wind energy plants the wind loads are producing inner structural loads (forces and moments). Hence, the main target is gaining knowledge about the histories of these inner load series. The approach is based on a modern standard acceleration measurement at specific positions on the wind turbine tower. The fatigue monitoring process is as follows: 1. Measurement of the <b>tower</b> <b>acceleration</b> with modern acceleration measurement equipment; 2. Evaluation of displacement histories based on the acceleration measurements using double integration functions; 3. Calculation of internal loads histories based on the equation of motion and the knowledge of towers stiffness; 4. Scaling and superposition of elementary stress responses for getting component stress histories and 5. Evaluation of fatigue accumulation based on stress histories and the Palmgren-Miner rule...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} {{and limitations of}} seismic isolation for the earthquake protection of a cable-stayed bridge under bi-directional seismic actions. A simplified lumped mass finite element model of the Quincy Bay-view Bridge at Illinois is developed for the investigation. The deck of the bridge is isolated from the towers by using elastomeric and sliding isolation systems. For the non-linear isolation systems, {{the interaction between the}} restoring forces in two orthogonal horizontal directions is duly considered in the response analysis. The seismic response of the bridge is obtained by solving the governing equations of motion in the incremental form using an iterative step-by-step method. A parametric study is also performed by varying important parameters of the isolation systems. The seismic response of the isolated cable-stayed bridge is compared with the corresponding response of the bridge without isolation systems. The results of the investigation indicate that the peak base shear response of the <b>towers</b> and deck <b>accelerations</b> are significantly reduced by the isolation. The displacement response of the hysteretic isolation systems is found to be increased when the bi-directional interaction of the bearing force is considered in the response analysis. Furthermore, it is also found that the response of the bridge is significantly affected by the variation in the parameters of the isolation systems...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Small wind {{turbines}} fulfil a unique niche within the energy market, and are frequently utilised for decentralised generation or in domestic ‘off-grid’ applications. Small {{wind turbines}} {{are defined by}} IEC 61400. 2, as having a rotor swept area less than 200 m 2, which corresponds to a power output typically less than 50 kW. Wind turbines of this class often rely on a tail fin for yaw control, and operate at much higher rotor speeds than large turbines to ensure optimal aerodynamic efficiency. Additionally, {{they are subject to}} low Reynolds number aerofoil operation, and often use control systems with minimal inputs to regulate generator output. As a consequence, they are not simply ‘scaled-down’ large wind turbines. Due to commercial interests, significant research and development effort has gone into large wind turbine technology, with little flowing into small turbine technology. This work has focused on developing a detailed aeroelastic model of a small, 5 kW horizontal-axis wind turbine. Experimental validation has been undertaken using operational measurements, revealing a good level of accuracy. Site wind measurements have highlighted differences in open-terrain wind turbulence models specified in the IEC standard to those measured at built environment sites. It has been shown that increasing turbulence levels have a detrimental effect on structural loadings and fatigue life, whereby fatigue loads in the standard are highly conservative and not indicative of operational loading. Results and conclusions will facilitate the development of lightweight, cost-effective, and structurally sound blades for small wind turbines. Wind conditions, turbine performance, and structural loading at turbulent built environment locations are not well understood. IEC 61400. 2 has proposed a simplified load model (SLM) for predicting load magnitudes, at the ‘cost’ of marked design conservatism. Few studies have undertaken detailed experimental measurements to record operational loading for predicting component fatigue life. To date, no studies have quantitatively compared fatigue life predicted by the SLM to aeroelastic simulations and measured operational loads. Work in this thesis focuses on bridging this knowledge gap by assessing the SLM with detailed aeroelastic simulations and experimental measurements of a 5 kW horizontal-axis Aerogenesis wind turbine installed at the University of Newcastle, Australia. A secondary aim is to measure and assess wind conditions and turbulence levels of built environment wind regimes. To measure the turbine performance, a simple, cost-effective data acquisition system was developed utilising Arduino-based microcontrollers. Turbine generator power, rotor speed, blade response, and <b>tower</b> <b>accelerations</b> were recorded using this system across a wide range of measured wind conditions. A detailed analysis of the site wind resource revealed that for all wind speeds, the ten-minute turbulence level was higher than that specified by the IEC standard normal turbulence model. The IEC turbulence model is therefore under-conservative for this complex terrain site, and may under-predict fluctuations in wind velocity, power generation, and structural loading. An aeroelastic model was developed within FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence) software, and included all necessary structural, inertial, aerodynamic, and controller parameters. Very good agreement was found between experimental measurements and predicted azimuthal blade structural response and aerodynamic loading at design conditions, where the blade root flapwise moment was predicted to within 8 %, and corresponding structural deflections within 10 %. The predicted dynamic response of the blades and tower was reasonably well captured in the low-frequency range, with a reduction in accuracy for the higher frequency response. This may be due to FAST’s limited ability to capture both higher-order aerodynamic and structural behaviour. When comparing the simulated and measured control system, the simulated controller tended to act more aggressively during highly unsteady conditions. To date this is the most comprehensive aeroelastic model of a turbine of this class reported in the literature. Using both measured wind from the Newcastle site, and simulated wind as per the Kaimal model detailed in the IEC standard, FAST simulations were undertaken {{to assess the impact of}} turbulence on: turbine electrical power output, tip speed ratio, rotor thrust and torque, blade loads, drive shaft loads, and tower base bending moment. An increase in turbulence levels generally resulted in an increase in mean performance and loading. Across the turbulence range investigated, the maximum rotor thrust load increased from 846 N to 2, 041 N, the maximum flapwise blade loading increased from 629 Nm to 1, 103 Nm, and tower base load was found to increase from 17 kNm to 41 kNm. This is a significant increase in structural loading and is not predicted by the IEC wind model for design conditions. Damage equivalent loads (DEL’s) at the blade root were produced from the SLM and measured operational data at 603 Nm and 70 Nm respectively, representing a significant over-prediction. Current blade fatigue life was estimated via the Palmgren-Miner linear damage model, with a life of 0. 09 years calculated when using the SLM. A fatigue life of 9. 18 years was calculated for the measured fatigue spectra, and is equal to 102 times that predicted by the SLM. The constant blade fatigue damage amplitude and cycle ratio predicted by the standard was well in excess of measurements and simulations, indicating that the SLM is over-conservative and not representative of the variable physical damage spectra that is experienced by the blade particularly during unsteady operation...|$|R
