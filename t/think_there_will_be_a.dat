500|$|Many Republicans were touting Huntsman as a {{possible}} rising star in the party {{and that he has}} a role in reshaping the party. Utah businessman Republican activist Tim Bridgewater said [...] "Huntsman has a very bright future." [...] Huntsman said that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lot of personalities emerging between now and 2012. I think the party needs to be smart enough to maintain an open mind. Obama was nowhere on the radar screen four years ago." [...] In June 2009, Huntsman top advisor John Weaver, who was also an advisor for McCain, claimed [...] "I firmly believe that Huntsman and people like him are the prescription for what ails us. But I have the feeling that our party maybe won't order that prescription in 2012." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2016, {{on moving}} the {{universe}} to Phase Four and reflecting on the first three, Feige said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> finality to moments of Phase Three, {{as well as new}} beginnings that will mark a different, a [...] different, a distinctively different chapter in what will someday be a complete first saga made up of three phases." [...] Joe Russo added, [...] "You build things up and people enjoy the experiences you've built up. But then you kind of reach an apex or you reach a climax, a moment where you go, 'This structure is really going to start to be repetitious if we do this again, {{so what do we do}} now?' So now, you deconstruct it. We're in the deconstruction phase with [...] and leading into , which are the culmination films." [...] A year later, Feige felt after the conclusion of Phase Three, Marvel might abandon grouping the films by phases, saying, [...] "it might be a new thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{vice-chairman}} of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Philip Hammond, said {{he wanted}} all football fans to boycott the magazine, saying, [...] "I am going to write to every fanzine in the country – including Liverpool F.C.'s – telling them to ban FHM. People are very upset by it. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> real boycott." [...] He added {{it would be like}} making jokes about the 2002 Bali bombings, in which eight fewer Australians were killed. The publication was finally discontinued in 2016, for unrelated reasons.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} possible, mademoiselle; {{we do not}} pretend to be invincible, but I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> some tough {{fighting}} first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> any {{necessity}} for shooting, Fred. I {{think if we}} merely show we mean business they will keep their distance." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jock looked startled. How {{if there}} be no such rotifer?" [...] he said. [...] "You don't really <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> nothing to depend when we are both gone?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In July 2014, Robinson, {{was sacked}} by Yorkshire for [...] "unprofessional actions"; in the 2014 season, {{he had made}} 7 T20 Blast {{appearances}} for Yorkshire, taking 6 wickets. Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie said of the situation that [...] "When a player consistently displays behaviour that isn’t professional, {{there has to be}} a point in time when you say ‘look, this isn’t really working, you’re obviously not that bothered about playing for the club’. That point came, and it was tough." [...] and that [...] "He’s got to learn about his game and about being a professional sportsman. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> future for him in the professional game, but I think he needs to learn a lot, and I think he can do it." [...] Later in the 2014 season, Robinson made 1 List A appearance for Hampshire.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> breeze presently," [...] {{the captain}} said, [...] "and {{from the right}} direction. However, the men won't mind working hard for a bit. They have had an easy time {{for the last two}} days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One does {{talk of the}} Devil on Sunday, for {{he is in the}} catechism," [...] {{returned}} Eugene. [...] "If {{he carries}} Mr. Arden off, do you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> great smoke, and that folk will see it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It was {{to satisfy}} my own mind,' she said, {{colouring}} a little. 'I didn't want any one {{to act on}} it. Indeed, I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> no occasion.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not," [...] 'Frisco Kid answered. [...] "And with Nelson {{and his two}} men an' French Pete, I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>'ll</b> <b>be</b> {{any need}} for you anyway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} write {{a line to}} the 'Squire, saying that you're ready to go bail, I do not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> any {{necessity}} of troubling you again to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see that," [...] Toussaint said gravely, [...] "but {{the number}} of those who know what is passing in France is small. However, we who do know, and are {{responsible}} for the mass who trust in us, must consider what is the best thing to do. Do you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> war between France and England?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quarts, she's lost {{bushels of}} them. It's got {{so that the}} hotels are superstitious about her. They won't let her in. They <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fire; and besides, if she's there it cancels the insurance. She's been waning a little lately, but this fire will set her up. She lost $60,000 worth last night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I can't {{give you any}} advice whatever, René, it is {{certainly}} horribly unpleasant being obliged to fight in a cause you detest, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very great deal of fighting till an assault is made on the city, and when that begins, I should say the Communists will be too busy to look for absentees from the ranks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's very true," [...] said Mrs. Pasmer, with an {{interest}} which she of course {{did her best to}} make impersonal. [...] "Do you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> more, later on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come and see, Lily, for I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{enough to}} reserve a fresh {{lot of things}} for Miss Hacket's affair. By-the-by, Regie, did you say it rained at Darminster?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And, {{now that}} there is no {{apprehension}} of any mistake, may I ask you to repeat the reasons why you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> danger in embarking in the 'Royal Caroline?'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I quite think so, Colonel. You see, {{the facts}} will all {{come out at}} the coroner's inquest, and, when they do so, I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good deal of strong feeling in the place if {{it is found that}} young Wyatt has been killed while bravely trying to capture Faulkner's murderer, {{while at the same time}} our warrant for his {{apprehension}} for the murder was still in force." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think I {{will take}} you," [...] called down Lucilla. [...] "I don't want too many passengers, {{especially}} women I don't know. But I often <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> gentleman passenger--one who {{really wants to}} go to Barbadoes and nowhere else. Sometimes he is one kind of a gentleman and sometimes another, but he is never a soldier or a sailor, but rather one who loves to stay at home. And now, sir, I think I must take my glass and try to pick out a ship from among the spots on the far distant waves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why should I {{hide the}} truth? Have you no {{eyes to see}} that he is enamoured of her loveliness--like others? Listen; a while ago my master Sinan chanced to lose his queen--how, we need not ask, but it is said that she wearied him. Now, as he must by law, he mourns for her a month, from full moon to full moon. But on the day after the full moon--that is, the third morning from now--he may wed again, and I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> marriage. Till then, however, your sister is as safe as though she yet sat at home in England before Salah-ed-din dreamed his dream." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> thousands?" [...] {{asked the}} Grafin, with an anxious {{lowering}} of the voice; [...] "really, thousands? Hundreds, perhaps; {{there is some}} uncertainty. Every one is not sanguine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will try}} not to get into scrapes, Miss Kate," [...] Reuben said. [...] "I don't do it often, you know, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> much chance of it, here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With {{the holy}} Tanofir, Master, until I fetch her, {{training}} {{her younger sister}} to be a diviner's worthy Cup. Only perhaps I shall never send, seeing that I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> fighting soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now imagine, not a pistol-shot {{from these}} crowded quays, a little Office hung round with charts that are pencilled and noted over various shoals and soundings. There is a movable {{list of the}} boats at work, with quaint and {{domestic}} names. Outside the window lies the packed harbour--outside that again the line of traffic up and down--a stately cinema-show of six ships to the hour. For the moment the film sticks. A boat--probably a [...] "common sweeper"--reports an obstruction in a traffic lane a few miles away. She has found and exploded one mine. The Office heard the dull boom of it before the wireless report came in. In all likelihood there is a nest of them there. It is possible that a submarine may have got in last night between certain shoals and laid them out. The shoals are being shepherded in case she is hidden anywhere, but {{the boundaries of the}} newly discovered mine-area must be fixed and the traffic deviated. There is a tramp outside with tugs in attendance. She has hit something and is leaking badly. Where shall she go? The Office gives her her destination--the harbour is too full for her to settle down here. She swings off between the faithful tugs. Down coast some one asks by wireless if they shall hold up their traffic. It is exactly like a signaller [...] "offering" [...] a train to the next block. [...] "Yes," [...] the Office replies. [...] "Wait a while. If it's what we <b>think,</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> little delay. If it isn't what we <b>think,</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> little longer delay." [...] Meantime, sweepers are nosing round the suspected area--"looking for cuckoos' eggs," [...] as a voice suggests; and a patrol-boat lathers her way down coast to catch and stop anything that may be on the move, for skippers are sometimes rather careless. Words begin {{to drop out of the}} air into the chart-hung Office. [...] "Six and a half cables south, fifteen east" [...] of something or other. [...] "Mark it well, and tell them to work up from there," [...] is the order. [...] "Another mine exploded!" [...] "Yes, and we heard that too," [...] says the Office. [...] "What about the submarine?" [...] "Elizabeth Huggins reports...." ...|$|E
5000|$|Yeah, we've got {{a ton of}} {{behind the}} scenes stuff. We made this in the era where {{everyone}} has a digital camera so we unearthed an interview from year one with Ellar, Lorelei, Patricia and myself, Patricia interviewed me in 2002. I hadn't seen this since we shot it, Ellar had forgotten {{quite a bit of}} it but he got to see himself as a wide-eyed six year old. For people who like the movie, I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lot of cool little treasures.|$|E

6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} are,--and so will I and Louey. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> room: {{it is so}} large. There is a cab for all the things. Dear Emily, I am {{so glad to see}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so serious, brother," [...] {{observed}} Beulah, earnestly, [...] "as {{to amount}} to that. Evert Beekman <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> trouble, {{but he does}} not appear to fancy it will go as far as very serious violence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{for those}} who work in it; and I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{something}} {{coming out of it}} for Sarah,--something, but it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> very small. And if so, she must depend for it solely on Mr Rubb." ...|$|R
5000|$|He later {{stated that}} {{international}} community needs [...] "less talk and more action" [...] {{to stop the}} violence. He has asked for a no-fly zone over Libya but does not support foreign ground troops. He {{sent a letter to}} current UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon calling the UN to impose the no fly zone. He has also stated that a no-fly zone {{is the only way to}} stop Gaddafi who he has said is relying completely on the air force. He viewed the departure of Moussa Koussa as a sign that the government is falling with in. He also does not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> stalemate.|$|E

50|$|The public began gaining {{confidence}} after important {{businessmen and}} fund managers addressed press about {{the concerns of}} the market. J. Paul Getty, an oil tycoon with large investments in Wall Street, addressed the press and explained, “When some folks see others selling, they automatically follow suit. I do the reverse—and buy. I don’t think the slide will go on. In fact, I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> rather substantial rise shortly.” Walter Benedict, fund manager of the billion dollar mutual fund, Investors Planning Corporation, also announced that the market was bullish, stating that his funds had recently purchased $20 million worth of stock. With the backing of successful investors, the public’s fears had temporarily subsided, and the stock markets rallied heavily in what became the greatest single day rally since the end of World War II.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{a regular}} young wildcat, Desmond. She very nearly got my hand in her mouth, and if she had she would have bitten a piece out. Well, I shouldn't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> any more of them." ...|$|R
5000|$|In August 2008, {{when asked}} if any efforts would be made to get {{additional}} federal money for the project, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley said [...] "Not by this senator, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> any by other senators." ...|$|R
6000|$|Coulthurst banged {{his hand}} down on the table. [...] "Then I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> an end of the trouble--and the affair could be {{arranged}} to meet your views. But however did you find {{the way into the}} Westerhouse country?" ...|$|R
