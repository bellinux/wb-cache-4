5|$|On April 15, 2015, a {{software}} update was released, adding {{the ability to}} purchase additional content, such as playable characters, new stages and Mii Fighter costumes, and addressing some balancing issues in the game. It also enabled online sharing of photos, Mii fighters, replays and custom stages. An update released on July 31, 2015, added an online tournament mode {{and the ability to}} upload replays to YouTube. A Smash Controller app was released on the Nintendo eShop on June 14, 2015, allowing players to use the Nintendo 3DS as a controller for the Wii U version without needing a copy of the 3DS version. On July 19, 2017, {{a software}} update was released that added the ability <b>to</b> <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> final batch of DLC Amiibo.|$|E
5|$|As Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) {{attempts}} {{to negotiate with}} the Aldeans, they briefly allow Dr. Crusher to reunite with her son on the planet. Wesley hints about the Custodian to her, while she secretly passes him a tricorder <b>to</b> <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> Aldeans. After Picard fails to get the Aldeans to agree to the children's return, they fire an energy weapon that sends the Enterprise three days away from Aldea at maximum warp. The Aldeans warn that they can send the Enterprise an impossibly far distance if they refuse to cooperate. During the return trip, Dr. Crusher reviews the scanner results and finds the Aldeans are suffering from radiation poisoning, which has harmed their reproductive capabilities but can be reversed if the source is discovered. On arrival back at the planet, Picard orders the crew {{to try to find a}} way through the planet's shield while he restarts negotiations.|$|E
5|$|In 2805, Earth is an {{abandoned}} planet covered in trash, with its people evacuated by megacorporation Buy-N-Large on giant starliners. BnL has left behind WALL-E robot trash compactors to clean up; however, all have since stopped functioning, except one unit who has gained sentience {{and is able}} to stay active using parts from other units. One day, WALL-E discovers a healthy seedling, which he returns to his home. Later, an unmanned spaceship lands and deploys an EVE probe <b>to</b> <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> planet. WALL-E is infatuated with EVE, who is initially hostile but gradually befriends him. When WALL-E brings EVE to his trailer and shows her the plant, however, she suddenly takes the plant and goes into standby mode. WALL-E, confused, unsuccessfully tries to reactivate her. The ship then returns to collect EVE, and with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its mothership, the starliner Axiom.|$|E

5|$|In September 2014, {{a wave of}} {{ransomware}} Trojans surfaced {{that first}} targeted users in Australia, under the names CryptoWall and CryptoLocker (which is, as with CryptoLocker 2.0, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker). The Trojans spread via fraudulent e-mails claiming to be failed parcel delivery notices from Australia Post; to evade detection by automatic e-mail scanners that follow all links on a page to scan for malware, this variant was designed to require users to visit a web page and enter a CAPTCHA code before the payload is actually downloaded, preventing such automated processes from being able <b>to</b> <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> payload. Symantec determined that these new variants, which it identified as CryptoLocker.F, were again, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker {{due to differences in}} their operation. A notable victim of the Trojans was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; live programming on its television news channel ABC News 24 was disrupted for half an hour and shifted to Melbourne studios due to a CryptoWall infection on computers at its Sydney studio.|$|E
5|$|While in Paris, the Doctor and Romana {{sense the}} effects of time distortion. They observe the Countess Scarlioni using an alien device <b>to</b> <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> {{security}} systems housing Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa at the Louvre. The pair meet Inspector Duggan, who suspects the Countess {{to be involved in}} an ongoing art theft scheme with her husband, Count Scarlioni. Duggan joins the Doctor and Romana in investigating the Scarlioni mansion. There, they find equipment used by Dr. Kerensky to experiment in time, the source of the time distortions, as well as six exact copies of the Mona Lisa. The Doctor instructs Romana and Duggan to continue investigating here while he returns to the TARDIS to visit da Vinci, a good friend of his. After the Doctor leaves, the Count returns after successfully stealing the Mona Lisa, and captures Romana and Duggan. Learning that Romana is familiar with time, he kills Dr. Kerensky and forces Romana to continue the tests.|$|E
25|$|CALIPSO uses a laser {{range finder}} <b>to</b> <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> Earth's {{atmosphere}} for the vertical distribution {{of dust and}} other aerosols. CALIPSO regularly tracks the Sahara-Amazon dust plume. CALIPSO has measured variations in the dust amounts transported— an 86 percent drop between the highest amount of dust transported in 2007 and the lowest in 2011.|$|E
60|$|It is, of course, jolly larks for Van Sweller, who has {{wealth and}} social {{position}} {{enough for him}} to masquerade safely even as a police commissioner doing his duty, if he wished to do so. But society, not given <b>to</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>the</b> countenances of mounted policemen, sees nothing unusual in the officer on the beat.|$|R
30|$|The surface {{structure}} of the biosorbent, before and after biosorption, was analyzed by scanning electron microscope (S- 300  N, Hitachi, Japan) at an electron acceleration voltage of 25  kV. Prior <b>to</b> <b>scanning,</b> <b>the</b> unloaded and dye-loaded CLR and CV samples were mounted on a stainless steel stab with double stick tape and coated with {{a thin layer of}} gold in a high-vacuum condition.|$|R

25|$|This is a sub-diffraction technique. Examples of {{scanning}} probe microscopes are the {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM), the Scanning tunneling microscope, the photonic force microscope and the recurrence tracking microscope. All such methods use the physical contact of a solid probe tip <b>to</b> <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> surface of an object, {{which is supposed to}} be almost flat.|$|E
25|$|Significantly, victims drown quietly {{underwater}} without alerting {{anyone to}} the fact that there is a problem and are typically found on the bottom as shown in the staged image at the right.

25|$|A record exists of one {{particular}} Bf 109H-1, Werknummer 110073, was recorded {{as having been}} converted to a photo-recon aircraft by a Luftwaffe long-range reconnaissance group, Fernaufklärungsgruppe 123, in May 1944, and flown on dates immediately following the Invasion of Normandy with one mission meant <b>to</b> <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> entire French coastline from Cherbourg to Ouistreham, from an altitude of some 15km (49,200ft), which proved to be just beyond the achievable ceiling of the selected aircraft.|$|E
25|$|As of 2008 SMRI {{was also}} {{supporting}} the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute, which plans <b>to</b> <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> entire genome for variants that predispose to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and screen {{hundreds of thousands}} of compounds against new molecular targets prior to clinical testing. The center was co-founded by Pamela Sklar, who published the first statistically meaningful gene identifications in schizophrenia and has demonstrated that schizophrenia is likely caused by many rare genetic variants.|$|E
25|$|One {{thousand}} sharpshooters were {{positioned on}} strategic rooftops throughout the Italian capital as Carabinieri police task forces swept aqueducts and drains for explosives. Helicopters were dispatched <b>to</b> <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> city streets from above. Plans to close Ciampino Airport from commercial flights and divert air traffic {{to and from}} Leonardo da Vinci International Airport in Fiumicino were finalised for {{the day of the}} Mass of Requiem and Interment of Pope John Paul II. Other smaller civilian commuter and recreational airports were also shut down.|$|E

25|$|On 7 March 2014, the Water Police {{purchased}} a new state-of-the-art catamaran vessel. The $1.9million, 14.9-metre-long boat boasts {{a range of}} modern technological features and will assist {{in the search for}} people stranded at sea or washed overboard and during periods of total darkness, poor light and rough seas. The vessel has the ability <b>to</b> <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> seabed for sunken vessels, and a radar can be switched into heat seeking mode to help locate a person at night, or in situations of poor visibility and rough conditions.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, thirty-one {{privacy and}} civil liberties {{organizations}} wrote a letter calling upon Google to suspend its Gmail service until the privacy issues were adequately addressed. The letter also called upon Google to clarify its written information policies regarding data retention and data sharing among its business units. The organizations also voiced their concerns about Google's plan <b>to</b> <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> text of all incoming messages {{for the purposes of}} ad placement, noting that the scanning of confidential email for inserting third-party ad content violates the implicit trust of an email service provider.|$|E
25|$|As the AIS team {{once again}} {{returned}} their attention full-time to the airborne interception task, they had {{by this time}} produced what was a complete radar system. However, the system could only {{be used in the}} manner of a flashlight, pointed in the direction of its target. This was fine for Gun Laying, but in order to be useful in the interception role, the system had to be able to find the target anywhere in front of the fighter. The team began to consider different ways <b>to</b> <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> radar beam to produce a search function.|$|E

50|$|Pages with a {{decorative}} riffled edging or curving {{in an arc}} due to a non-flat binding can be difficult <b>to</b> <b>scan</b> using an ADF. An ADF is designed <b>to</b> <b>scan</b> pages of uniform shape and size, and variably sized or shaped pages can lead <b>to</b> improper <b>scanning.</b> <b>The</b> riffled edges or curved edge can be guillotined off to render the outer edges flat and smooth before the binding is cut.|$|R
25|$|ZombiU (known as Zombi on {{platforms}} {{other than}} the Wii U) is a first-person survival horror video game developed by Ubisoft Montpellier and published by Ubisoft. It was released for the Wii U as its launch game in November 2012. In the game, the player assumes control of a human survivor amid a 2012 zombie apocalypse. Featuring a permadeath system, it uses the Wii U GamePad extensively <b>to</b> <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> environment and maintain the survivor's inventory. ZombiU was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2015 as Zombi. The port, handled by Straight Right, adds new melee weapons and removes the multiplayer feature.|$|E
25|$|A second Blenheim, V6000, became {{available}} for additional testing. The team {{began to use}} this aircraft as a testbed for alternate scanning solutions, leaving the original N3522 with the spiral-scan system. One of the first tests was to use a manual scanning system {{in place of the}} spiral or helical systems, allowing the operator <b>to</b> <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> sky using controls on his receiver sets. Once a target was found, they could flip a switch and the system would track that target automatically from that point. After considerable effort, they decided this concept simply didn't work, and that the mechanical scanning systems were a better solution.|$|E
25|$|The {{sentinel}} {{hypothesis of}} REM sleep was {{put forward by}} Frederick Snyder in 1966. It {{is based upon the}} observation that REM sleep in several mammals (the rat, the hedgehog, the rabbit, and the rhesus monkey) is followed by a brief awakening. This does not occur for either cats or humans, although humans are more likely to wake from REM sleep than from NREM sleep. Snyder hypothesized that REM sleep activates an animal periodically, <b>to</b> <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> environment for possible predators. This hypothesis does not explain the muscle paralysis of REM sleep; however, a logical analysis might suggest that the muscle paralysis exists to prevent the animal from fully waking up unnecessarily, and allowing it to return easily to deeper sleep.|$|E
