[...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal {{agreed that it was}} the best song of the episode, [...] "done with smart aplomb [...] heart".

Bowman said [...] "When I finished 'Paper Clip', I thought, 'I don't know what else I am going to do <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> top this'" [...] In 1996 Mitch Pileggi called the episode one of the show's finest, particularly enjoying the line where he tells The Smoking Man to [...] "pucker up and kiss my ass".

In contrast to the previous seasons, which had several concurrent mysteries, Thomas planned for season 3 to have three consecutive mysteries, the first of which would be the serial rapist.

Whitney is left alone and vulnerable, and falls for a man, Rob Grayson, played by Jody Latham, who exploits her for financial gain.

Gilly Green, Head of UK Grants at Comic Relief, said: [...] "It is vital that we continue to alert young people to the dangers if we are to stop them being exploited and the opportunity to work with EastEnders will make a huge audience aware of this issue. We have been working with the EastEnders script writers and some of the young women from projects we support to ensure the story reflects the reality of young people caught up in sexual exploitation." [...] Kevin Cahill, Chief Executive of Comic Relief, added [...] "We have worked over many years with EastEnders in all kinds of ways. It's been a real pleasure <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> work together on a piece of serious drama, in the best traditions of public service, which will highlight an important issue and also, because it occurs on the night of Comic Relief, actually help raise crucial funds to help young women caught up in it." [...] The storyline begins when Bianca is sent to prison and Whitney rejects her family, moving in with Janine and attempting to make money by stealing from The Queen Victoria, causing her to get sacked, working for Max, whom she tries to kiss as she has a crush on him, and pickpocketing. When she is caught, Rob rescues her from the situation and offers her what McGarty called a [...] "dream life", which Whitney thinks is her chance to move up in the world as she feels lonely and has no friends.|$|E
