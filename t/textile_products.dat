At the end of June 2012, textile mills employed 20% of the nation's workforce, and generated 1.3trillion rupees ($13.8billion) in <b>textile</b> <b>products,</b> most of which were exported to the US and Europe. While Punjab's economy is driven primarily by agriculture, the textile industry along with leather products and light engineering goods play an important role, with more than 48,000 industrial units spread across Punjab.

Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah analisis literatur dan analisis grafik garis. Analisis literatur diharapkan mengungkapkan fenomena ketidakselarasan semangat investasi dengan semangat transformasi struktural. Analisis grafik garis diharapkan mengungkapkan fenomenapenurunan kinerja dan penurunan peran pada industri tekstil dan produk tekstil. Analisis grafik garis menggunakan data tahun 2001 hingga 2011 industri tekstil dan produk tekstil berbagai provinsi di Pulau Jawa, selain Provinsi Banten dengan variabel berupa nilai tambah atas dasar harga input, jumlah orang miskin dan PDRB harga konstan tahun 2000. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa pada industri tekstil dan produk tekstil berbagai provinsi di Pulau Jawa mengalami permasalahan deindustrialisasi yang terdiri atas semangat transformasi struktural tidak menonjol, nilai tambah menurun dan peran minimal dalam pengentasan kemiskinan.

25|$|The {{reaction}} of Dutch industry and agriculture was a defensive realignment in three directions. First, {{there was a}} shift in the product mix to higher value products (for instance more luxury <b>textile</b> <b>products,</b> livestock fattening instead of dairy farming). This was of necessity a self-limiting solution, as it made exporting even more difficult, so this response led to a further contraction of the sectors in question. The second response was investment in labor-saving means of production. However, this required a level of technological innovation that apparently was no longer attainable. (In this respect it is remarkable that the number of patents granted in the Netherlands was remarkably lower in this period than {{in the first half of}} the 17th century.) Besides, this type of reorientation in investment was undercut by a third response: outsourcing of industrial production to areas with a lower wage level, like the Generality Lands, which solved the high-wage problem in a different way, but also contributed to deindustralization in the maritime provinces.|$|E

Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process. While many fabrics are made completely of cotton, some materials blend cotton with other fibers, including rayon and synthetic fibers such as polyester. It can either be used in knitted or woven fabrics, as it can be blended with elastine to make a stretchier thread for knitted fabrics, and apparel such as stretch jeans.

Imports of manufactured goods, machinery, and transportation equipment represented 62.6 percent of total import value in 1975, fell to 53.9 percent in 1980 as imports were cut back during the [...] "period of readjustment" [...] of the economy (1979–81), and rose again to 75.2 percent in 1985.
