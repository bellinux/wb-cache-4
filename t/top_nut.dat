50|$|Greek pancakes {{are called}} tiganites (τηγανίτες, {{from the ancient}} Greek τηγανίτης) and are popular across Greece and Cyprus. They are {{slightly}} thicker than crêpes and can be sweet or savoury. Their main ingredients are flour, olive oil or butter, milk and eggs. They are usually drizzled with honey and cinnamon, and sometimes <b>topped</b> with cheese, <b>nuts,</b> fruits or vegetables. Various small shops in Cyprus called creperies sell crepes, either savoury or sweet varieties. Tiganites can be served for breakfast or dessert, and in some places like Corfu, patras are customarily served in the feast days of Saint Spyridon and Saint Andrew. In Cyprus the pancake recipe is used for a similar dish such as Genoese canelloni - ground meat with tomato sauce, cheese, and sometimes bechamel sauce - instead of the traditional cannelloni dried pasta sold at supermarkets.|$|R
40|$|European {{hazelnut}} is {{an important}} nut crop in Italy, where about 121, 750 tons of in-shell nuts are produced every year. Roasting {{is the most important}} practice for hazelnut preservation and commonly is carried out in commercial electrical ovens at 120 - 160 °C for 10 - 20 min. This needful practice is time and energy expensive, so the development of new processing methods is required to reduce processing costs and to obtain <b>top</b> quality roasted <b>nuts.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a simple microwave treatment for hazelnuts peeling and roasting. With this aim, some physical (colour, temperature, moisture) and chemical (taste, lipoxygenase activity, fatty acids, vitamins, sensory attributes) features of inshell nuts and kernels of three Italian hazelnut varieties (Tonda di Giffoni, Tonda Romana and Nocchione) after conventional oven or microwave roasting were evaluated. Results showed that microwave roasting of kernels for 450 s gave a higher peeling score than the conventional oven treatment. This paralleled with better colour and taste scores for microwaved roasted kernels. Furthermore, a 360 - 450 s microwave roasting was able to inactivate almost completely lipoxygenases, avoiding advers...|$|R
5000|$|In the Maldives, any coco de mer nuts {{that were}} found in the ocean or on the beaches were {{supposed}} to be given to the king, and keeping a nut for yourself or selling it could have resulted in the death penalty. However, Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor was able to purchase one of these nuts for 4,000 gold florins. The Dutch Admiral Wolfert Hermanssen also received a nut as a gift for his services, from the Sultan of Bantam in 1602, for fighting the Portuguese and protecting the capital of Bantam. However, the nut that the admiral was given was missing the top part; apparently the Sultan had ordered the <b>top</b> of the <b>nut</b> to be cut off, in order not to upset the noble admiral’s modesty.

40|$|The {{effect of}} urea {{treatment}} on chemical composition and in vitro digestibility of seven crop residues was studies. Sorghum stover, wheat straw, cotton stalk, sugar cane <b>tops,</b> baggase, ground <b>nut</b> haulms, and ground nut hull {{were treated with}} 5 % urea for four weeks. The untreated and urea-treated residues were subjected to chemical analysis, and two-stage in vitro digestibility. The {{results showed that the}} crude protein of untreated residues was ranged between 4. 6 % in baggase to 9. 4 % in ground nut haulms and increased significantly for all treated samples, the increment ranged between 1 to 8 units. However, in untreated samples, the least value for neutral detergent fiber (NDF) was 43. 3 % in cotton and reach up to 78. 8 in baggase. These values were significantly decreased by urea treatment. The reduction ranged from 1 unit to 5 units. The in vitro dry matter digestibility of untreated residues was ranged between 47. 4 % in baggase to 81. 8 % in cotton and increased significantly for all treated samples, the increment ranged between 1 to 16 units. However, in untreated samples, the least value for in vitro NDF digestibility was 14. 3 % in baggase and the highest was 36. 2 % in cotton. These values were significantly increased by urea treatment. The increments ranged between 3 unit and 9 units. In conclusion, crops residues are low in crude protein and high in neutral detergent fiber resulting in low dry matter and NDF digestibility. Urea treatment enhanced dry matter and NDF digestibility through increasing the crude protein and reducing the ND...|$|R
