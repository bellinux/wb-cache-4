I think women prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>my</b> manners. They like men to be well dressed, so I do my best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>my</b> grammar – {{but at the same time}} I bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|E

So I don't believe in crawling anymore. I just stood up and shoot like hell...I fought about two or three months.

2500|$|Stanley Donen, {{brought to}} Hollywood by Kelly {{to be his}} {{assistant}} choreographer, received co-director credit for On the Town.

I needed one <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>my</b> performance, and one {{to work with the}} cameraman on the timing..without such people as Stanley, Carol Haney and Jeanne Coyne I could never have done these things. When we came to do On the Town, I knew it was time for Stanley to get screen credit because we weren't boss-assistant anymore but co-creators." [...] Together, they opened up the musical form, taking the film musical out of the studio and into real locations, with Donen taking responsibility for the staging and Kelly handling the choreography. Kelly went much further than before in introducing modern ballet into his dance sequences, going so far in the [...] "Day in New York" [...] routine as to substitute four leading ballet specialists for Sinatra, Munshin, Garrett and Miller.|$|E
