5|$|Because of the {{economic}} benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} digital divide. A 2003 survey by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line <b>telephone</b> <b>subscription</b> for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} a possible link between cellular telephone use and risks for various diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). We conducted a large nationwide cohort study of 420 095 persons whose first cellular <b>telephone</b> <b>subscription</b> was between 1982 and 1995, who were followed through 2003 for hospital contacts for a diagnosis of a CNS disorder. Standardized hospitalization ratios (SHRs) were derived by dividing the number of hospital contacts in the cohort by the number expected in the Danish population. The SHRs were increased by 10 - 20 % for migraine and vertigo. No associations were seen for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis or epilepsy in women. SHRs decreased by 30 - 40 % were observed for dementia (Alzheimer disease, vascular and other dementia), Parkinson disease and epilepsy among men. In analyses restricted to subscribers of 10 years or more, the SHRs remained similarly increased for migraine and vertigo and similarly decreased for Alzheimer disease and other dementia and epilepsy (in men); the other SHRs were close to unity. In conclusion, the excesses of migraine and vertigo observed in this first study on cellular telephones and CNS disease deserve further attention. An interplay of a healthy cohort effect and reversed causation bias due to prodromal symptoms impedes detection of a possible association with dementia and Parkinson disease. Identification of the factors that result in a healthy cohort might be of interest for elucidation of the etiology of these diseases...|$|E

40|$|In Chapter 1, we {{construct}} {{a model to}} illustrate conditions under which a government controlled Post, Telephone, and Telegraph ministry (PTT), which is a monopolist in multiple demand-complementary markets, can increase its profit by exiting some of its markets. The PTT may increase profit by exiting one market, provided that a foreign firm can supply the market at lower cost and the PTT retains market power in a complementary market, where it recovers the difference. The PTT will generally earn greater income by regulating and taxing the abandoned market than by allowing it to become competitive. However, consumer welfare would be greater if the PTT were to permit competition in the abandoned market. In Chapter 2, we use Heckman's model for consistent estimation on selected data, modified to allow for group dummies in the second-stage regression, to estimate supply of wireless <b>telephone</b> <b>subscription,</b> on a panel of data. The modification enables us to control for country-specific effects, and to adjust for the penetration that would otherwise exist in years and countries where wireless is unavailable. We find substantial bias in the estimate of the supply function. That is, equivalent economic conditions in countries where wireless is not yet available will likely result in lower levels of supply than those where wireless is available. The quantity of wireless telephones supplied is explained by time, the number of existing fixed telephone lines, and telephone company revenues, but not by prices. In Chapter 3, we {{construct a}} means of resource allocation on a data network when bandwidth becomes scarce. Our approach extends Elwalid and Mitra's (1992) model so that two users may send streams of information to a router, which employs an auction mechanism to award priority to one stream when the router is congested. The high bidder in this auction enjoys the right to transmit data without risk of loss, whereas the low bidder loses data during congested periods. The second-price auction offers its property of incentive compatibility in this real-time framework. Allocations arising from this mechanism are more economically efficient than those in which information is discarded without regard to economic value...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MPhil (Information Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. Mobile <b>telephone</b> <b>subscription</b> in {{developing}} countries has {{increased by more than}} 500 percent since 2005, with Africa experiencing the highest growth rate globally. Amongst Africa’s 306. 5 million subscribers, recorded in 2008, an unexpectedly high adoption rate of the technology by poor, often illiterate rural communities is observed. Mobile telephony generally provides African rural users access to electronic communication for the first time. Providing access to communication, information and knowledge, mobile phones present a platform for economic and social interaction in rural Africa. The extent of the resulting positive socio-economic impact on the developing world has lead to mobile telephony increasingly being viewed as a potential development tool for the socio-economic upliftment of the rural poor. This thesis is inspired by the potential for value creation to end users of mobile telephony, leading to the proposition that the rapid expansion of mobile telephony in rural Africa can contribute significantly to the sustainability of these communities’ rural livelihoods. For this proposition to be valid, mobile telephony has to provide value beyond being communication tool. It has to provide value in income generating activities by increasing opportunities for access to financial and social capital with mobile business models appropriate to the rural African context. To assess the appropriateness of mobile value offerings, the rural African context was analyzed using the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework. Through multi-level analysis, the challenges and issues that influence the lives of the rural poor were explored and the dominant livelihood strategies in terms of income generating activities were identified. Apart from agricultural income streams, waged labor, migration and micro-entrepreneurial activities provide non-agricultural income streams. Creating an appropriate mobile business ecosystem for rural Africa requires the collaboration of a complex network of actors within a value constellation to co-produce value for the end users. Three conditional factors were identified for mobile telephony and emerging mobile business models to contribute successfully to sustainable livelihoods: adaptation of the technology by providers, user appropriation to make the technology their own and the assimilation of it into their livelihood strategies. These factors were researched for validation through the study of existing literature and reported case studies. It was found that these three conditional factors were unequivocally met. Firstly, the mobile telecommunication industry active in Africa is seen to successfully adapt and innovate solutions that are relevant to African rural communities’ vulnerabilities and livelihood strategies. Secondly, African mobile phone users have successfully adopted and appropriated mobile telephony to create value for themselves in their livelihood strategies, often independent of external interventions. They are claiming ownership of the technology and not merely using it as a communication tool. Thirdly, by assimilating mobile telephony into their livelihood strategies, value-creation within their income generating activities have been made possible. This value creation is impacting users’ social and financial capital positively. This thesis concludes that mobile telephony and emerging mobile business models are contributing to increasing African rural dwellers’ income generating potential, reducing their vulnerability to shocks, and providing them with a voice; thereby contributing to sustainable rural livelihoods...|$|E
40|$|Each {{and every}} day, {{enterprises}} are making business processes more efficient; {{this is possible}} because of revolutionary developments in information technologies. At the same time, however, these developments seriously threaten the economic order, reducing the demand for labor as existing jobs are taken over by machines. Developments in information technologies have also introduced more uncertainty in the economic environment. This new economic model {{is known as the}} digital economy. “Digitalization” refers to its use of information technology in all business processes. “Digital divides” occur between individuals who use information technologies and those who cannot. A digital divide may occur between countries or between individuals. The criteria for judging the digitalization of countries are internet penetration and speed of internet access; the criteria for assessing the digitalization of individuals are <b>telephone</b> <b>subscription,</b> computer ownership, access to broadband internet, and internet usage time. The basic production of this digital economy is knowledge. The relative weight of the production factors of classical economic theory has changed. The importance of knowledge and entrepreneurship has increased, while the importance of labor and capital is decreasing. Unemployment is rising in an unstoppable way, from the persistent loss of employment for production, and the conversion of laborto consumptionis becoming increasingly difficult. Individuals who use technology effectively in the digital economy have relatively higher incomes than those in more labor-intensive sectors. The digital divide becomes an increasingly important issue as the share of electronic commerce increases in proportion to the total volume of trade. E-commerce is, in fact, the most important driving force of the digital economy, This book deals with the new concepts determining the future path of e-commerce and aims at providing a new perspective to the field.
