25|$|Throughout this period, the Cholas were {{constantly}} {{troubled by the}} ever resilient Sinhalas trying to overthrow the Chola occupation of Lanka, Pandya princes trying to win independence for their traditional territories, and by the growing ambitions of the Chalukyas in the western Deccan. The history of this period was one of constant warfare between the Cholas and of these antagonists. A balance of power existed between the Chalukyas and the Cholas {{and there was a}} <b>tacit</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the Tungabhadra river as the boundary between the two empires. However, the bone of contention between these two powers was the growing Chola influence in the Vengi kingdom. The Cholas and Chalukyas fought many battles and both kingdoms were exhausted by the endless battles and a stalemate existed.|$|E
25|$|In 383, the usurper Magnus Maximus withdrew {{troops from}} {{northern}} and western Britain, probably leaving local warlords in charge. Around 410, the Romano-British expelled the magistrates of the usurper Constantine III, ostensibly {{in response to}} his failures to use the Roman garrison he had stripped from Britain to protect the island. Roman Emperor Honorius replied to a request for assistance with the Rescript of Honorius, telling the Roman cities to see to their own defence, a <b>tacit</b> <b>acceptance</b> of temporary British self-government. Honorius was fighting a large-scale war in Italy against the Visigoths under their leader Alaric, with Rome itself under siege. No forces could be spared to protect distant Britain. Though it is likely that Honorius expected to regain control over the provinces soon, by the mid-6th century Procopius recognised that Britannia was entirely lost to the Romans.|$|E
25|$|Yemen is a {{developing}} country, and the poorest {{country in the}} Middle East. Under the rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen was described by critics as a kleptocracy. According to the 2009 international corruption Perception Index by Transparency International, Yemen ranked 164 out of 182 countries surveyed. In the absence of strong state institutions, elite politics in Yemen constituted a de facto form of collaborative governance, where competing tribal, regional, religious, and political interests agreed to hold themselves in check through <b>tacit</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the balance it produced. The informal political settlement was held together by a power-sharing deal between three men: president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who controlled the state; Major General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, who controlled the largest share of the Republic of Yemen Armed Forces; and Abdullah ibn Husayn al-Ahmar, figurehead of the Islamist Islah party and Saudi Arabia's chosen broker of transnational patronage payments to various political players, including tribal sheikhs. The Saudi payments have been intended to facilitate the tribes' autonomy from the Yemeni government and to give the Saudi government a mechanism with which {{to weigh in on}} Yemen's political decision-making.|$|E

2500|$|Ould Taya, on his {{way back}} from Fahd's funeral, landed in Niamey, the capital of Niger. He met Niger's {{president}} Mamadou Tandja before going to a villa in Niamey. Speaking to Radio France Internationale on August 5, Ould Taya condemned the coup, saying that there had [...] "never been a more senseless coup in Africa" [...] and that it reminded him of the adage [...] "God save me from my friends, I'll take care of my enemies". On August 8, he unsuccessfully attempted to order the armed forces to restore him to power. Broad support for the coup appeared to exist across the country; Ould Taya's own PRDS party abandoned him {{a few days after the}} coup by endorsing the new regime's transitional plan. International reaction to Ould Taya's overthrow was initially strongly hostile, including the suspension of Mauritania from the African Union, but after several days the new rulers were apparently diplomatically successful in winning <b>tacit</b> international <b>acceptance</b> of their transitional regime. The United States in particular at first called for Ould Taya to be restored to power but subsequently backed away from this.|$|R

It provided fuel from peat cuttings, pasture for animals and accommodated squatters, mainly fishermen, who had encroached on the common with the <b>tacit</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the community. An inclosure act was drawn up in 1802, designed to remove all squatters who had been there less than 20years. Resistance to the evictions was fierce and was only suppressed by a contingent of dragoons. The act was finally applied in 1814; new roads were built across the moor; boundaries were established; allotments allocated; and wetland reclaimed.|$|E
500|$|Citizenship matters were {{complicated}} by the fact that British nationality law treated those born in Hong Kong as British subjects (although they did not enjoy full rights and citizenship), while the People's Republic of China (PRC) did not recognise Hong Kong Chinese as such. The main reason for this was that recognising these people as British was seen as a <b>tacit</b> <b>acceptance</b> of a series of historical treaties that the PRC labelled as [...] "unequal", including the ones which ceded Hong Kong Island, the Kowloon Peninsula and the New Territories to Britain. The British government, however, recognising the unique political situation of Hong Kong, granted 3.4 million Hong Kongers a new type of nationality known as British National (Overseas), which is established in accordance with the Hong Kong Act 1985. Among those 3.4 million people, there are many British Nationals (Overseas) who are eligible for full British citizenship. Both British Nationals (Overseas) and British citizens are British nationals and Commonwealth citizens according to the British Nationality Law, which enables them to various rights in the United Kingdom and the European Union.|$|E

40|$|Advances in food {{biotechnology}} and food {{science in the}} early 1990 s have opened the gates of new markets for genetically modified foods. A broad dispute {{over the use of}} foods derived from genetically modified organisms and other uses of genetic engineering in food production in terms of key scientific researches, their impact on health and eco-systems, food safety and food security, labelling and regulations, traceability is still lasting. Beside the scientifically, technical, ethical and regulators arguments, the economical aspects of the genetically modified food market is influenced by the social acceptance of it. Consumers' perception and their attitudes are different and depending on many factors. A survey of youth as undergraduate students of Constantin Brancoveanu University from Romania revealed certain differences in attitudes regarding the genetically modified foods that may be partially explained by the consumers' information. Referring the consumer behaviour, this study showed rather a <b>tacit</b> attitude of <b>acceptance</b> of the genetically modified food goods than a vehement rejection. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{profound}} promise {{implied in}} expanding and deepeningcommunity is often invoked and celebrated in discussions ofincreasing global interdependence. Growing interdependenceimplies ever-widening circles of concern. It also implies atleast <b>tacitly</b> questioning the <b>acceptance</b> of independence forsome and dependence for (many) others. Such implications, Ithink, are entirely laudable. From a Buddhist perspective, {{as well as}} from that of much ofcontemporary science, interdependence can be affirmed asthe deep nature of all things. Yet, there are Buddhistteachings that the cycles of conditions leading to suffering ortrouble (samsara) are without beginning, as well as teachingsthat all beings have Buddha-nature or the capacity forenlightenment (nirvana). Affirming that all things ariseinterdependently is not to affirm that they do so in anecessarily liberating way. Interdependence, we can say, hasno essential self-nature. It can mean increasing wealth,skillful means, and happiness. It can also mean deepeningpoverty, trouble, and suffering. Realizing the promise ofexpanded and deepened community in the context ofincreasing economic, social, political, and culturalglobalization pivots on keenly discerning existing andemerging patterns of interdependence and orienting them in aliberating (nirvanic) rather than a troubling (samsaric) direction. Ultimately, the promises of community and ofdeepening interdependence turn on karma - that is, on thespecific experiential force of intentions and values...|$|R
40|$|Music {{performance}} dysfunction in professionally trained elite musicians is a broad, pervasive, yet oft times {{narrow and}} temporary phenomenon, {{situated in a}} culture rarely understood by those outside the field of professional music. This project explored the meaning of music performance dysfunction in professional musicians by addressing how musicians understand themselves {{in the field of}} music and through their relationship to music. The nature of inquiry for this project used an overarching ethnographic and sociological paradigm upon which was set a conceptual framework encouraged by the work of French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. The project was organised around three domains of the musician's lived experience: the subjective world of the professional musician; negative affect, anxiety, and dysfunction in the musician arising through the context of music performance; and the emotions, memories, and insights that emerge through Guided Imagery and Music. Music is the dimensional phenomenon that binds all domains. The three domains were investigated through two distinct studies that elicited a rich tapestry of findings and illuminated a colourful world, unique to the field. The first study addressed a few salient features of being a modern professional musician. Fifteen musicians were interviewed about {{what it is to be}} a musician, what it is to perform, what is music to the musician, what is the musician’s relationship to music, and the issue of music performance anxiety. Phenomenological analysis revealed themed issues surrounding a <b>tacit</b> understanding and <b>acceptance</b> by the musicians of the enormous highs and devastating lows in their chosen career. Acute music performance anxiety was understood as a continuum within a larger of the occupational field and personal life, a musician’s position along which is dependent upon an individual’s propensity to embody the many influences within the social domains of a complex occupational field. The second study was built upon the first study. The issue of music performance dysfunction in three professional musicians was individually explored using the music therapy method of Modified Guided Imagery and Music (MGIM) in a multiple case study design. This study explored each musician’s unique experiences of performance dysfunction in a ten week program of themed MGIM sessions. Each session comprised specifically programmed music that supported the topic at hand. Through hermeneutic and phenomenological analysis, the music based exploration brought to light the unique foundational issues of each musician’s performance dysfunction and gave each an opportunity to renew their relationship with music The findings from each study revealed a distinct composite essence. Furthermore, a reflective overview combining findings from both studies showed emotion as a substance of exchange in performance. The quality and meaning of musicians’ experience were found to prevail within a social milieu, and were determined and dependent on the emotional foundation of an individual's dispositional tendencies that develop through embodied experience. Through the qualitative and sociological frame employed in this project, the musicians’ experience of music performance dysfunction was shown to be a complex and enduring concern that has deleterious effects on career and personal life...|$|R

Then the secret meetings between Miss Aldclyffe and the other woman at the little inn at Hammersmith and other places: the commonplace name she adopted: her swoon at some painful news, and the very slight knowledge the elder female had of her partner in mystery. Then, more than a year afterwards, the acquaintanceship of her own father with this his first love; the awakening of the passion, his acts of devotion, the unreasoning heat of his rapture, her <b>tacit</b> <b>acceptance</b> of it, and yet her uneasiness under the delight. Then his declaration amid the evergreens: the utter change produced in her manner thereby, seemingly the result of a rigid determination: and the total concealment of her reason by herself and her parents, whatever it was.
