40|$|Random dopant {{fluctuation}} {{effects of}} gate-all-around Si nanowire field-effect transistors (FETs) are investigated {{in terms of}} different diameters and junction gradients. The nanowire FETs with smaller diameters or shorter junction gradients increase relative variations of <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> currents and <b>the</b> mismatch of <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> currents between source-drain and drain-source bias change in the saturation regime. Smaller diameters decreased current drivability critically compared to standard deviations of <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> currents, thus inducing greater relative variations of <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> currents. Shorter junction gradients form high potential barriers in the source-side lightly-doped extension regions at on-state, which determines the magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> currents and fluctuates <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> currents greatly under thermionic-emission mechanism. On the other hand, longer junction gradients affect lateral field to fluctuate <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> currents greatly. These physical phenomena coincide with correlations of <b>the</b> variations between <b>drain</b> currents and electrical parameters such as threshold voltages and parasitic resistances.

40|$|The use of {{vertical}} <b>drains</b> to improve <b>the</b> performance of potentially liquefiable ground during earthquakes has received increased attention {{over the last}} two decades. This paper briefly describes the formulation of a finite element code, FEQDrain, developed to analyze the development of excess pore pressure in a layered soil profile, accounting for vertical and horizontal drainage. The code includes equations describing a vertical drain with a non-constant "equivalent hydraulic conductivity" which more accurately describes the flow properties of perforated pipes and wick drains, and head losses due to horizontal flow into <b>the</b> <b>drain.</b> It can also model the presence of a reservoir directly connected to <b>the</b> <b>drain,</b> allowing <b>the</b> accumulation of the water discharged by <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> element as well as head losses in the reservoir itself. In contrast, most analyses used in practice assume the water level in <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> is at <b>the</b> ground surface and therefore all flow into <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> escapes. <b>The</b> accumulation of water within <b>the</b> <b>drain,</b> however, can lead to a significant retardation of flow into <b>the</b> <b>drain,</b> causing an increase in the predicted pore pressures developed during the earthquake...|$|R

25|$|Some work {{continued}} until 1775, consisting largely of raising river banks, making drains deeper, and extending <b>the</b> <b>drains</b> {{that had been}} created. However, the system was inadequate, as there were large areas that remained under water near Leven, {{in the north of}} the area, and at Weel, to the east of Beverley. Flooding during the winter months was still a regular problem, because <b>the</b> <b>drains</b> could not cope with rain from the low-lying carrs, when they were full with water from higher ground to the north of Holderness. The engineer William Jessop spent a month investigating the problems, studying some , and presented a report in July 1786. Further survey work was then carried out by George Plummer, and formed the basis for Jessop's detailed plan, which was agreed in 1787. He produced specifications for drains, embankments, dams and tunnels, with the overriding principle that the water from the uplands to the north should be kept entirely separate from the internal drains of the area. Once the project got under way, Jessop visited {{from time to time to}} check on progress. He made a total of seven visits between 1789 and 1792, when his involvement and that of George Plummer, who had acted as resident engineer, ceased. Anthony Bower then took over as resident engineer, overseeing the work until 1795. This phase of the scheme was finally completed in 1805, at a cost of £16,000.|$|E
