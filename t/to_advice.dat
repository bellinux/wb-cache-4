5|$|The Governor {{appoints}} {{almost all}} military and civil {{officers of the}} State government, subject <b>to</b> <b>advice</b> and consent of the Maryland State Senate. The Governor also appoints certain boards and commissions {{in each of the}} 24 Counties and in Baltimore City, such as local Boards of Elections, commissions notaries public, and appoints officers to fill vacancies in the elected offices of Attorney General and Comptroller. Should a vacancy arise in either of the two houses of the General Assembly, the Governor also fills that vacancy, though the Governor must choose from among the recommendations of the local party organization to which the person leaving the vacancy belonged. Any officer appointed by the Governor, except a member of the General Assembly, is removable by him or her, if there is a legitimate cause for removal. Among the most prominent of the Governor's appointees are the 24 secretaries and heads of departments that currently make up the Governor's Cabinet, also known as the Executive Council.|$|E
5|$|In February 1952, Hergé was {{involved}} in a car crash in which Germaine's leg was shattered; she had to have a steel rod implanted in it, and was confined to a wheelchair for several months. Their relationship was further strained when they received news of Wallez's death in September 1952. His friendship with Van Melkebeke also broke apart in this period, in part due <b>to</b> <b>advice</b> gained from an alleged clairvoyant, Bertje Janueneau, whom both Hergé and Germaine were increasingly relying upon for guidance. In January 1955 a young woman named Fanny Vlamynck was hired as a colourist at the Studios. Hergé embarked on an extra-marital affair with her in November 1956, {{with the rest of the}} studio staff soon finding out. Germaine grew suspicious of her husband's affections for Fanny, but was also experiencing strong romantic attraction to her ballroom dance partner. Hergé and Germaine went on a cruise for the former's fiftieth birthday in May 1957, in which they visited Casablanca, Rabat, Palermo, and Rome, and in October went on a second holiday, this time to Ostend. Following this, he revealed his affair with Fanny to Germaine.|$|E

LeBor and Sell assert that Milošević prepared {{the ground for}} his ascent to power by quietly replacing Stambolić's supporters with his own people, thereby forcing Pavlović and Stambolić from power.|$|E

25|$|There is some {{dispute over}} how much direct {{operational}} control Haig maintained at this time, Tim Travers in particular arguing that he allowed his Army Commanders (Plumer, Byng, Horne, Birdwood and Rawlinson) a very free hand, whilst {{at the same time}} Ferdinand Foch, whose role had initially been confined <b>to</b> <b>advice</b> and deployment of reserves, was exerting ever-greater influence over strategy. Haig was irritated that Foch insisted that Plumer's Second Army remain part of an Army Group commanded by the King of the Belgians, so that the French and Belgians could take credit for liberating Brussels.|$|E
25|$|When it {{was time}} for him to choose an heir, the Yongle Emperor wanted to choose his second son, Zhu Gaoxu.

As a result, Zhu Gaoxu became infuriated and refused to give up jockeying for his father's favour and refusing to move to Yunnan Province, where his princedom was located.

25|$|During {{the first}} half of the 2015–16 season, Horvat juggled {{heightened}} goal-scoring expectations along with increased defensive responsibility after injuries to Brandon Sutter and Henrik Sedin. After enduring two goal-scoring droughts of nine and twenty-seven games, respectively, he went on a 6-game point streak between January 4 and 15, during which he scored six goals and nine points. When that streak ended on January 17, it was tied for the longest active point streak in the NHL. Horvat credited this change <b>to</b> <b>advice</b> from his father to shoot the puck more often, in lieu of bull rushing the net, in addition to increased chemistry with left-winger Sven Bärtschi. Horvat ended his sophomore season with 16 goals and 40 points.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the conflict, the {{government}} of the province of Angola was headed by the Governor-General of Angola, who had both legislative and executive powers, reporting directly to the Portuguese Minister of the Overseas. The Governor-General did not have however military responsibilities, which were vested in the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Angola, who reported to the Minister of National Defense and the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. However, the Governor-General was responsible for the internal security forces. The Governor-General was assisted by a cabinet made up of a Secretary-General (that served as deputy Governor-General) and several provincial secretaries. There was a Legislative Council - including both appointed and elected members - with legislative responsibilities that were gradually increased in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1972, it was transformed in the Legislative Assembly. There was also a Council of Government, which included the senior public officials of the province and which was responsible <b>to</b> <b>advice</b> the Governor-General in his legislative and executive responsibilities.|$|E
25|$|Veneralia (April 1) {{was held}} in honour of Venus Verticordia ("Venus the Changer of Hearts"), and Fortuna Virilis (Virile or strong Good Fortune), whose cult was {{probably}} by far the older of the two. Venus Verticordia was invented in 220 BC, in response <b>to</b> <b>advice</b> from a Sibylline oracle during Rome's Punic Wars, when a series of prodigies was taken to signify divine displeasure at sexual offenses among Romans of every category and class, including several men and three Vestal Virgins. Her statue was dedicated by a young woman, chosen as the most pudica (sexually pure) in Rome by a committee of Roman matrons. At first, this statue was probably housed in the temple of Fortuna Virilis, perhaps as divine reinforcement against the perceived moral and religious failings of its cult. In 114 BC Venus Verticordia was given her own temple. She was meant to persuade Romans of both sexes and every class, whether married or unmarried, to cherish the traditional sexual proprieties and morality known to please the gods and benefit the State. During her rites, her image was taken from her temple to the men's baths, where it was undressed and washed in warm water by her female attendants, then garlanded with myrtle. Women and men asked Venus Verticordia's help in affairs of the heart, sex, betrothal and marriage. For Ovid, Venus's acceptance of the epithet and its attendant responsibilities represented {{a change of heart}} in the goddess herself.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{dispute over}} how much direct {{operational}} control Haig maintained in the Hundred Days, Tim Travers arguing that he exercised “a symbolic form of leadership”, allowing his Army Commanders (Plumer, Byng, Horne, Birdwood and Rawlinson) a very free hand, whilst {{at the same time}} Ferdinand Foch, whose role had initially been confined <b>to</b> <b>advice</b> and deployment of reserves, was exerting ever-greater influence over strategy. Robin Prior argues that by the second half of 1918 both Lloyd George and Haig were “moving steadily to the sidelines”, although he also concedes that Haig intervened in operations much less now he knew the BEF to be a fine fighting instrument and “he proved far more effective as a commander” as a result. By contrast Sheffield argues that Haig was Foch’s principal subordinate—they met sixty times between April and November—and influenced his strategy (in Wiest's view Foch was also “a buffer between Haig and his political tormentors in London”.) “At last (Haig) was able to behave as the sort of “arms-length” Commander-in-Chief that was his ideal: setting broad objectives” but devolving detailed planning of battles. Besides, “he had presided over the transformation of the army” and “Haig’s performance as a general improved as the army matured. He was … doing fewer things better”. GHQ also {{played a key role in}} sequencing the attacks of the armies in late September, and keeping them fully supplied.|$|E

500|$|John's chosen heir was {{his fourth}} son, Manuel I Komnenos. According to Niketas Choniates, a {{historian}} of Byzantium, Manuel was chosen over his elder surviving brother {{because of his}} ability to listen carefully <b>to</b> <b>advice.</b> Manuel was known for his lively and charismatic personality; he was known for his love for all things from Western Europe. Manuel arranged jousting matches, even participating in them, an unusual experience for the Byzantines. [...] Manuel himself is generally considered the most brilliant of the four emperors of the Komnenos dynasty; unusual for a Byzantine ruler, his reputation was particularly good in the west and the Crusader states, especially after his death. The Latin historian William of Tyre described Manuel as [...] "beloved of God... a great-souled man of incomparable energy", [...] "memory will ever be held in benediction".

500|$|Although {{the initial}} American {{commitment}} {{to the war in}} Vietnam had been limited <b>to</b> <b>advice</b> and materiel support, by 1964 there were 21,000 US advisors in South Vietnam. However, with the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) weakened by successive defeats {{at the hands of the}} communists, the South Vietnamese government faltering, and Saigon threatened with a major offensive, the situation led to a significant escalation of the war in 1965, with a large-scale commitment of US ground troops under the command of General William Westmoreland. At first the Americans had adopted a cautious strategy, applied to the strictly limited role of base defence by US Marine units. This was abandoned in April 1965, and replaced by a new [...] "enclave strategy" [...] of defending key coastal population centres and installations. This strategy required the introduction of nine additional US battalions, or 14,000 troops, to bring the total in Vietnam to 13. Allied nations of the Free World Military Forces were expected to contribute another four battalions.|$|E
