5|$|During World War II, San Francisco {{became a}} major debarkation point for {{servicemen}} stationed in the Pacific Theater. The U.S. military, which was concerned about male homosexuality, had a policy of dismissing servicemen caught in known gay establishments with blue discharges. As many of these men faced ostracism from <b>their</b> <b>communities</b> <b>and</b> families, they chose {{to remain in the}} city. The number of men that remained was a significant factor {{in the creation of a}} homosexual community in San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|The Foundation's commitment, {{along with}} a similar {{foundation}} run by West Bromwich Albion, the unique relationship that Aston Villa has with Acorns Children's Hospice and Tottenham Hotspur has with SOS Children's Villages UK, are some leading examples of commitment in {{the highest level of}} football to responsibility and change in the communities in which they work and who enrich them through their support and ticket sales.

5|$|Between September 1997 and September 2006, Woon was {{seconded}} to the Foreign Service. He was Singapore's Ambassador to Germany from 6 February 1998 to July 2003, and was concurrently accredited to Greece from March 2000 to July 2003. He then {{served as}} Ambassador to Belgium (from 22 August 2003) with concurrent accreditation to the European Union, the Netherlands (from 22 October 2003), Luxembourg and the Holy See. In this capacity, he represented Singapore together with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law S. Jayakumar {{at the funeral}} mass of Pope John Paul II in the Vatican City on 8 April 2005, {{believed to be the}} largest gathering of heads of state in history. In 2006, the Vatican made Woon a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, which is conferred on Roman Catholic men and women in recognition of their service to the Church, unusual labours, support of the Holy See, and the good example set in <b>their</b> <b>communities</b> <b>and</b> country.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} from December 5 to December 6, Petras Vilei≈°is printed 36,000 {{copies of the}} {{resolution}} for distribution. After the assembly, notorious for its loud, lengthy and intense debates, the delegates returned to <b>their</b> <b>communities</b> <b>and</b> started {{to carry out its}} resolutions. The old Russian administrations were replaced in 125 out of the 280 volosts (82 in Kaunas, 33 in Suvalkai, and 10 in Vilnius Governorates). These communities elected their own representatives, organized their own schools where classes were taught in the Lithuanian language, and stopped paying taxes. While the first Russian responses were disorganized and confused, the authorities soon marshaled their armed forces and returned the situation back to normal. The process was relatively peaceful; {{there were only a few}} clashes between armed groups of peasants and Tsarist military forces. Unlike in neighboring Latvia or Estonia, peasants did not rise against their landlords. A number of the most prominent activists of this movement were arrested and sent to Siberia.|$|E

Many progressive ideals were pressed into action through the resources of women's clubs, including kindergartens, juvenile courts, and park conservation. Women's clubs, many with their literary backgrounds, helped promote and raise money for schools, universities and libraries. Women's clubs were often {{at the forefront of}} various civil rights issues, denouncing lynching, promoting women's rights and voting rights.|$|E
25|$|With the booty {{secured from}} conquest, Umar {{was able to}} support its faith in {{material}} ways: the companions of Muhammad were given pensions on which to live, allowing them to pursue religious studies and exercise spiritual leadership in <b>their</b> <b>communities</b> <b>and</b> beyond.

In practice indigenous people do not fully participate in the management of their lands or natural resources, in part because responsibility for implementing the law is delegated to the 23 provinces, only 11 of which have constitutions recognizing indigenous rights.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Kelly {{moved to}} Alice Springs {{and started to}} {{establish}} further contacts with community members, organisations and institutions across the APY Lands.

At the heart of the issues people repeatedly identified in the consultations lay two causes: alienation between the generations and an imminent loss of the Pitjantjatjara language and culture.|$|E
25|$|The {{medicine}} men {{of ancient}} Maya society provided many services to <b>their</b> <b>communities</b> <b>and</b> {{were held in}} high regard. Known for their extensive knowledge and spirituality, medicine men were called upon for many reasons, but most often for their healing capabilities. These Maya doctors often employed specialists for specific healing techniques such as bone-setting and childbirth, similar to the method of modern doctors. In addition to his duties as a doctor and sorcerer, a medicine man not only cured diseases, but also sporadically accepted compensation to cause them. The ah-man was also called ah-pul-yaah, the ‚Äúdisease thrower‚Äù.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} stages of the rebellion, the defense of the towns of lower Iraq was largely handled by provincial garrisons, local volunteers and slaves, with the central {{government}} in Samarra initially contributing little or no troops to stop the Zanj. Militia groups composed of men from Basra, al-Ubullah and other towns were soon organized, and set off to fight off the Zanj in an attempt to protect <b>their</b> <b>communities</b> <b>and</b> property. Over the course of late September and early October, these groups engaged the Zanj in several battles, but they were usually defeated by the rebels. At the same time, 'Ali ibn Muhammad's forces continued to grow, and soon numbered in the thousands.|$|E

The ICBL participates in the periodical meetings of the Mine Ban Treaty process, urges states not parties to the treaty to join and non-state armed groups to respect the mine ban norm, condemns mine use and promotes public awareness and debate on the mine issue, organizing events and generating media attention.|$|E
25|$|Second, {{the school}} was to be apolitical. The {{education}} was not designed to encourage African Americans to challenge the status quo. African Americans were offered a basic education that enabled them to return to <b>their</b> <b>communities</b> <b>and</b> support themselves within the system. Washington feared that if a colored school challenged {{the politics of the}} day, white citizens might refuse to allow it to open or would later shut it down. This was not the classical type of education offered to many white students in the north. Highly educated African Americans such as W. E. B. Du Bois thought the Tuskegee model was too limited and did not support it. Born in Massachusetts and educated in the North, including a doctorate at Harvard University, he argued for ensuring that the most talented students could get a full academic education, to advance the race.|$|E
