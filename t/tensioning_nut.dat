40|$|A {{coupling}} device has a transversely arranged, open-end groove in a flange {{attached to a}} pipe end. The groove in the flange receives a circumferentially arranged locking flange element on the other coupling member and permits alignment of the bores of the coupling members when the locking flange element is in the open end groove. Upon alignment of the bores of the coupling members, a trigger member is activated to automatically release a spring biased tubular member {{in one of the}} coupling members. The tubular member has a conical end which is displaced into the other coupling member to lock the coupling members to one another. A <b>tensioning</b> <b>nut</b> is threadedly movable on a coupling member so as to be moved into tightening engagement with the other coupling member...|$|E
40|$|We have {{designed}} {{a system that}} can assemble a SPO compact flange subsea {{with the use of}} a ROV. The compact flange will be assembled using hydraulic bolt turning tools, and have automatically nut entering capabilities. Bolts will be pre-loaded using hydraulic <b>tension</b> <b>nuts,</b> and the seal ring inside the flange is made replaceable...|$|R
40|$|Nondimensional stress {{intensity}} factor (K) solutions for continuous circumferential cracks in threaded fasteners were calculated using finite element methods that determined the energy release rate during virtual crack extension. Assumed loading conditions included both remote <b>tension</b> and <b>nut</b> loading, whereby the effects of applying the load to the thread flank were considered. In addition, K solutions were developed for axisymmetric surface cracks in notched and smooth round bars. Results showed that the stress concentration of a thread causes a considerable increase in K for shallow cracks, but has much less effect for longer cracks. In the latter case, values of K can be accurately estimated from K solutions for axisymmetric cracks in smooth round bars. Nut loading increased K by about 50 % for shallow cracks, but this effect became negligible at crack depth-to-minor diameter ratios (a/d) greater than 0. 2. An evaluation of thread root acuity effects showed that root radius {{has no effect on}} K when the crack depth exceeds 2 % of the minor diameter. Closed-form K solutions were developed for both remote-loading and nut-loading conditions and {{for a wide range of}} thread root radii. The K solutions obtained in this study were compared with available literature solutions for threaded fasteners as well as notched and smooth round bars...|$|R
40|$|In a {{proposed}} improvement of tooling for friction stir welding, gimballed shoulders would supplant shoulders that, heretofore, have been fixedly aligned with pins. The proposal is especially relevant to self-reacting friction stir welding. Some definitions of terms, recapitulated from related prior NASA Tech Briefs articles, are prerequisite to a meaningful {{description of the}} proposed improvement. In friction stir welding, one uses a tool that includes (1) a rotating shoulder on top (or front) of the workpiece and (2) a pin that rotates with the shoulder and protrudes from the shoulder into {{the depth of the}} workpiece. In conventional friction stir welding, the main axial force exerted by the tool on the workpiece is reacted through a ridged backing anvil under (behind) the workpiece. When conventional friction stir welding is augmented with an auto-adjustable pin-tool (APT) capability, the depth of penetration of the pin into the workpiece is varied in real time by a position- or forcecontrol system that extends or retracts the pin as needed to obtain the desired effect. In self-reacting (also known as self-reacted) friction stir welding as practiced heretofore, there are two shoulders: one on top (or front) and one on the bottom (or back) of the workpiece. In this case, a threaded shaft protrudes from the tip of the pin to beyond the back surface of the workpiece. The back shoulder is held axially in place against <b>tension</b> by a <b>nut</b> on the threaded shaft. Both shoulders rotate with the pin and remain aligned coaxially with the pin. The main axial force exerted on the workpiece by the tool and front shoulder is reacted through the back shoulder and the threaded shaft into the friction-stir-welding machine head, so that a backing anvil is no longer needed. A key transmits torque between the bottom shoulder and the threaded shaft, so that the bottom shoulder rotates with the shaft. This concludes the prerequisite definitions of terms...|$|R
40|$|A {{tool that}} would be useable in both {{conventional}} and self-reacting friction stir welding (FSW) has been proposed. The tool would embody both a prior tooling concept for self-reacting FSW and an auto-adjustable pin-tool (APT) capability developed previously as an augmentation for conventional FSW. Some definitions of terms are prerequisite to a meaningful description of the proposed tool. In conventional FSW, depicted in Figure 1, one uses a tool that includes (1) a rotating shoulder on top (or front) of the workpiece and (2) a rotating pin that protrudes from the shoulder into {{the depth of the}} workpiece. The main axial force exerted by the tool on the workpiece is reacted through a ridged backing anvil under (behind) the workpiece. When conventional FSW is augmented with an APT capability, the depth of penetration of the pin into the workpiece is varied in real time by a position- or force-control system that extends or retracts the pin as needed to obtain the desired effect. In self-reacting (also known as self-reacted) friction stir welding (SR-FSW), there are two rotating shoulders: one on top (or front) and one on the bottom (or back) of the workpiece. In this case, a threaded shaft protrudes from the tip of the pin to beyond the back surface of the workpiece. The back shoulder is held axially in place against <b>tension</b> by a <b>nut</b> on the threaded shaft. The main axial force exerted on the workpiece by the tool and front shoulder is reacted through the back shoulder and the threaded shaft, back into the FSW machine head, so that a backing anvil is no longer needed. A key transmits torque between the bottom shoulder and the threaded shaft, so that the bottom shoulder rotates with the shaft. A tool for SRFSW embodying this concept was reported in "Mechanism for Self-Reacted Friction Stir Welding" (MFS- 31914), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 28, No. 10 (October 2004), page 53. In its outward appearance, the proposed tool (see Figure 2) would fit the above description of an SR-FSW tool. In this case, the FSW machine would have an APT capability and the pin would be modified to accept a bottom shoulder. The APT capability could be used to vary the distance between the front and back shoulders in real time to accommodate process and workpiece-thickness variations. The tool could readily be converted to a conventional FSW tool, with or without APT capability, by simply replacing the modified pin with a conventional FSW pin...|$|R
