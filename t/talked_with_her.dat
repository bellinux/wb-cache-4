5|$|After their marriage, Prince Andrew {{continued}} {{his career in}} the military and Princess Andrew became involved in charity work. In 1908, she visited Russia for the wedding of Grand Duchess Marie of Russia and Prince William of Sweden. While there, she <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> aunt, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna, who was formulating plans for the foundation of a religious order of nurses. Princess Andrew attended the laying of the foundation stone for her aunt's new church. Later in the year, the Grand Duchess began giving away all her possessions in preparation for a more spiritual life. On their return to Greece, Prince and Princess Andrew found the political situation worsening, as the Athens government had refused to support the Cretan parliament, which had called for the union of Crete (still nominally part of the Ottoman Empire) with the Greek mainland. A group of dissatisfied officers formed a Greek nationalist Military League that eventually led to Prince Andrew's resignation from the army and the rise to power of Eleftherios Venizelos.|$|E
5|$|Rena Mero {{returned}} to the WWF, which {{is now known as}} World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) on the April 3, 2003 episode of SmackDown!, reprising her role as Sable. Sable continued portraying a villainess and spent several months in a storyline with new Playboy covergirl Torrie Wilson. During their angle, the evil Sable followed Wilson down to her matches, <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> backstage, and on one occasion, she left Wilson in a tag match alone to fend for herself. Sable eventually challenged Wilson to a showdown bikini contest at Judgment Day. After Sable got the bigger applause, Wilson removed her chaddi to reveal an even smaller bikini underneath, and Special Guest Referee Tazz declared Wilson the winner. After the match, Wilson went up to Sable and kissed her before exiting the ring. Sable then had an altercation with the guest judge Tazz, dumping water on him on the following edition of SmackDown!, as a means of gaining revenge for declaring Wilson the winner.|$|E

500|$|This classic {{scene was}} born {{when the film}} started to focus too much on Harry. Crystal remembers saying, [...] "'We need {{something}} for Sally to talk about,' and Nora said, 'Well, faking orgasm is a great one,' and right away we said, 'Well, the subject is good,' and then Meg came on board and we <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{about the nature of}} the idea and she said, 'Well, why don't I just fake one, just do one?'" [...] Ryan suggested that the scene take place in a restaurant, and it was Crystal who came up with the scene's classic punchline – [...] "I'll have what she's having." [...] In 2005, the quote was listed 33rd on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes list of memorable movie lines. Reiner recalls that at a test screening, all of the women in the audience were laughing while all of the men were silent.|$|E

500|$|Lody {{returned}} to Edinburgh on 17 September, taking the train from King's Cross to Edinburgh. He met a young Scottish woman, Ida McClyment, gave her his card and <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{a while before}} going into another carriage to smoke. There he overheard a conversation between two men, one apparently a submariner travelling to the naval base at Rosyth {{and the other a}} sailor who talked about Harwich. Lody later professed his surprise at how the two men were [...] "talking in a rather free way, considering the present times". One of the men talked about the difficulties of serving on a submarine, while the other asked Lody: [...] "What country are you? Are you from the other side?" [...] Lody replied, [...] "Yes, I am an American." [...] They began discussing the war and talked about the recent sinking of the cruiser HMS Pathfinder, which had become the first ship ever to be sunk by a torpedo fired by a submarine. The sailor told Lody, [...] "We are going to put out mines as the Germans have done so. We have a big surprise in store for the Germans." [...] Lody was not convinced and, after shaking hands with the sailor, left the smoking car.|$|E
2500|$|Sierra {{was one of}} the [...] "heroes" [...] of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Dale Maharidge's Homeland, an {{examination}} of the mind-set behind the United States' alleged post-9/11 jingoism and suppression of dissent. Portraying her as an unconventional and [...] "good-hearted kid," [...] Maharidge reported that Sierra took a telemarketing job following the cessation of the controversy: [...] "She was supposed to make two sales a day. The first day, she made five sales, and continued at that rate. When I again <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> in the winter, she was living in a dorm and attending Marshall University in West Virginia. She was happy and her only complaint was that the classes were too easy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, Joplin's bluesy vocal style {{attracted}} the attention of the San Francisco-based psychedelic rock band Big Brother and the Holding Company, which had gained some renown among the nascent hippie community in Haight-Ashbury. She was recruited to join the group by Chet Helms, a promoter who had known her in Texas and who at the time was managing Big Brother. Helms sent his friend Travis Rivers to find her in Austin, Texas, where she had been performing with her acoustic guitar, and to accompany her to San Francisco. [...] Aware of her previous nightmare with drug addiction in San Francisco, Rivers insisted that she inform her parents face-to-face of her plans, and he drove her from Austin to Port Arthur (he waited in his car while she <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> startled parents) before they began their long drive to San Francisco. [...] Joplin joined Big Brother on June 4, 1966. Her first public performance with them was at the Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco.|$|E

2500|$|Tiana is {{loosely based}} on both Princess Emma, the heroine of Baker's novel, and the princess who appears in the Grimm fairy tale. Clements {{described}} Baker's The Frog Princess as [...] "a kind of fairy tale with a twist" [...] because in it [...] "the princess kissed the frog and instead of him turning into a prince she turned into a frog." [...] Clements and Musker pitched {{the idea for the}} film to Walt Disney Animation Studios CEO John Lasseter [...] "as a hand-drawn film with an African American heroine", conceiving Tiana [...] "as someone who would never have been a big fan of Disney fairy tales." [...] The character was inspired by famed restaurateur Leah Chase, who Clements and Musker met on their research trip to New Orleans. Clements elaborated, [...] "There's a woman in New Orleans named Lee (sic) Chase who was a waitress and ultimately opened a restaurant with her husband … we met with her and we <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> and she went to kind of into her story, her philosophy about food, which is a big element of the movie." ...|$|E

That the thoughts which came to me could come to a heart so lacerated, so torn, so full of pain as mine had been that morning, seemed wonderful, and yet they came.|$|E
