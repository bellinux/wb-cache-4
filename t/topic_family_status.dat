30|$|Finally, {{by using}} <b>family</b> <b>status</b> origin as the proxy for one’s non-certifiable qualifications, {{this study also}} {{indicates}} the important role one’s class origin plays in the reproduction and reinforcement of social status. Different from Blau and Duncan’s (1967) seminal study about <b>family</b> <b>status</b> origin’s positive association with one’s educational attainment (namely, certifiable qualifications), this study echoes Bourdieu’s (1987) concept of social capital by linking one’s non-certifiable qualifications to <b>family</b> <b>status</b> origin. That is, <b>family</b> <b>status</b> origin matters for an individual’s status attainment, not only due to its significant impact on this individual’s acquisition of certifiable qualifications {{but also because of}} its essential role in shaping one’s non-certifiable qualifications. Consideration of the multidimensional influences of one’s <b>family</b> <b>status</b> origin on status attainment is much needed in future studies.|$|R
40|$|The myth {{of family}} law’s {{inherent}} localism is sticky. In the past, {{it was common}} to hear sweeping claims about the exclusively local nature of all family matters. In response to persuasive critiques, a narrower iteration of family law localism emerged. The new, refined version acknowledges the existence of some federal family law but contends that certain “core” family law matters—specifically, <b>family</b> <b>status</b> determinations—are inherently local. I call this <b>family</b> <b>status</b> localism. Proponents of <b>family</b> <b>status</b> localism rely on history, asserting {{that the federal government}} has always deferred to state <b>family</b> <b>status</b> determinations. <b>Family</b> <b>status</b> localism made its most recent appearance (although surely not its last) in the litigation challenging section 3 of The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). This Article accomplishes two mains goals. The first goal is doctrinal. This Article undermines the resilient myth of family law localism by uncovering a long history of federal <b>family</b> <b>status</b> determinations. Although the federal government often defers to state <b>family</b> <b>status</b> determinations, this Article shows that there are many circumstances in which the federal government instead relies on its own <b>family</b> <b>status</b> definitions. The second goal of this Article is normative. Having shown that Congress does not categorically lack power over <b>family</b> <b>status</b> determinations, this Article begins a long-overdue conversation about whether the federal government should make such determinations. Here, the Article brings family law into the rich, ongoing federalism debate—a debate that, until now, has largely ignored family law matters. In so doing, this Article seeks to break down the deeply rooted perception that family law is a doctrine unto itself, unaffected by developments in other areas, and unworthy of serious consideration by others. ...|$|R

40|$|The duty to {{accommodate}} <b>family</b> <b>status</b> has garnered significant attention {{in recent years}} due to {{the changing nature of}} familial obligations. Courts, tribunals and arbitrators alike have struggled with how to define the concept of <b>family</b> <b>status</b> accommodation, resulting in two conflicting tests. The uneven application of these tests has led to a variance in case law regarding how broadly <b>family</b> <b>status</b> accommodation should be interpreted. This paper will begin by examining the evolution of the duty {{to accommodate}} in labour law. The two tests that have divided the Canadian jurisprudence and the subsequent problems that arise from each test will then be examined. This paper will then analyze recent cases that have attempted to combine the two approaches to create a new amalgamated approach. It is proposed that this amalgamated test is the proper test for <b>family</b> <b>status</b> accommodation, as it strikes the appropriate balance between the various competing interests and will not unduly favour the employer or the employee in future <b>family</b> <b>status</b> claims...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to compare the {{patterning}} of health by <b>family</b> <b>status</b> and employment status among women in Finland and Sweden and to explore whether the patterning of health by <b>family</b> <b>status</b> is influenced by employment status and income. An additional aim was to identify which combinations of <b>family</b> <b>status</b> and employment status are especially disadvantageous for women's health. The data derived from comparable interview surveys carried out in 1994 / 1995. The analyses were restricted to ages 25 - 49; 2282 women in Finland and 2685 in Sweden. Firstly, age-adjusted prevalence percentages were presented by <b>family</b> <b>status</b> and employment status. Secondly, the patterning of health by <b>family</b> <b>status</b> and employment status, and the influence of adjusting for income, were studied by logistic regression analysis. The main results showed that women living in couples with children had the best health in both countries. Additional analyses showed that in Finland particularly poor health can be found among women who are simultaneously non-partnered and non-employed, whereas in Sweden poor health can be found among all non-employed groups of women. Income did not explain the poor health among the non-partnered and non-employed. This study confirmed that health is patterned by <b>family</b> <b>status</b> and employment status both among Finnish and Swedish women. It was found that non-employed women without a partner are likely to have poor health. In order to reduce inequalities in health among women, more efforts should be put on promoting health among these groups. Women Family Health Employment Finland Sweden...|$|R

40|$|The idea of {{work-life balance}} has {{received}} increasing attention from media, government, unions, and academics in recent years. This {{is due to}} the significant changes {{in the nature of the}} family and of roles within family. An interdisciplinary approach can explain the societal context that has prompted a rise in <b>family</b> <b>status</b> accommodation claims. Most notably, women have entered the paid workforce in unprecedented numbers and demographic shifts have created a growing need for eldercare. Over the past two decades, divergent approaches to <b>family</b> <b>status</b> discrimination in the employment context have developed in Canada. The central dispute appears to be the issue of what circumstances are captured by the concept of <b>family</b> <b>status</b> discrimination. The majority of cases deal with families struggling to maintain caregiving responsibilities in an employment context. In Johnstone, the FCA handed down what many expected to be the final word on <b>family</b> <b>status</b> discrimination. The refined definition put forward confirms that a bona fide childcare problem caused by workplace rules or policies is protected by human rights legislation. However, just two years later, the HRTO chose to reconsider the logic of Johnstone as it applies to <b>family</b> <b>status</b> generally, and particularly in cases involving eldercare. Misetich will allow for employees to more easily establish <b>family</b> <b>status</b> discrimination, moving the needle again along the spectrum towards a broad approach. While human rights litigation is an important avenue for addressing employment discrimination, a more comprehensive response requires law reform and policy development. Working families need family-work policies and programs that reflect the current realities of the sandwich generation who may be juggling both child and eldercare...|$|R
40|$|<b>Family</b> <b>status</b> and role, {{fundamental}} {{building block}} of family structure, are influenced and determined by family cultural background factors. The {{purpose of this}} study is to examine and compare how family cultural background factors influence <b>family</b> <b>status</b> and role between Muslim and Santal communities in rural Bangladesh. In so doing, the village Kalna, situated in the Talonda union of Tanore Upazila of Rajshahi district of Bangladesh, was purposefully selected for this study where two distinct cultural communities: Muslim amd Santal were living side by side as neighbors in the same geographical setting. In this village there wereabout 380 families: 300 families were Muslim’s and the rest of them were Santal’s. For this study 70 couples from Muslim community and 30 couples from Santal community were selected through cluster random sampling and then structure questionnaire method with close and open ended questions was applied for data collection on family cultural background factors and <b>family</b> <b>status</b> and role. The results of Pearson correlation without significant test of the study reveal that family cultural background factors are differentially positively or negatively related to <b>family</b> <b>status</b> and role. It is argued that there are differences in family cultural background factors that are differentially correlated to or influence on <b>family</b> <b>status</b> and role between Muslim and Santal communities in rural Bangladesh...|$|R
