25|$|Mikulincer, Shaver and Pereg have {{developed}} a model for this dynamic. According to the model, when people experience anxiety, they try to reduce <b>their</b> <b>anxiety</b> by seeking closeness with relationship partners. However, the partners may accept or reject requests for greater closeness. This leads people to adopt different strategies for reducing anxiety. People engage in three main strategies to reduce anxiety.|$|E
25|$|The anxiety {{triggered}} by these conditions motivates the individuals {{to engage in}} behaviors that bring them physically closer to caregivers. A similar dynamic occurs in adults in relationships where others care about them. Conditions involving personal well-being, conditions involving a relationship partner, and conditions involving the environment can trigger anxiety in adults. Adults try to alleviate <b>their</b> <b>anxiety</b> by seeking physical and psychological closeness to their partners.|$|E
25|$|To try {{to reduce}} <b>their</b> <b>anxiety</b> and {{alleviate}} depression, people with social phobia may use alcohol or other drugs, {{which can lead to}} substance abuse. It is estimated that one-fifth of patients with social anxiety disorder also suffer from alcohol dependence. However, some research suggests SAD is unrelated to, or even protective against alcohol-related problems. Those who suffer from both alcoholism and social anxiety disorder are more likely to avoid group-based treatments and to relapse compared to people who do not have this combination.|$|E

50|$|In 1953, Hanscom Park pastor Reverend Ben Wallace {{helped found}} the Ministers' Clinic of Nebraska, a {{discussion}} group for mostly Methodist ministers to talk about <b>their</b> <b>anxieties</b> and understandings in relationship to those of professional psychiatrists. The group received national news coverage, including an article in Time magazine.|$|R
25|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} therapy encourages {{patients to}} confront the triggers that induce arouse <b>their</b> <b>anxiety.</b> By facing the very cause of the anxiety, it is thought to help diminish the irrational fears that are causing the issues to begin with. The therapy begins with calming breathing exercises, followed by noting the changes in physical sensations felt as soon as anxiety begins to enter the body. Many clients are encouraged to keep journals. In other cases, therapists may try and induce feelings of anxiety so that {{the root of the}} fear can be identified.|$|E
25|$|One very {{successful}} example {{of virtual reality}} therapy exposure therapy is the PTSD treatment system, Virtual Iraq. Using a head mounted display and a game pad, patients navigate a Humvee around virtual recreations of Iraq, Afghanistan, and the United States. By being safely exposed to the traumatic environments, patients learned to reduce <b>their</b> <b>anxiety.</b> According to {{a review of the}} history of Virtual Iraq, one study found that it reduced PTSD symptoms by an average of fifty percent, and disqualified over seventy-five percent of participants for PTSD after treatment.|$|E
25|$|Self-enhancement {{suggests}} that optimistic predictions are satisfying {{and that it}} feels good to think that positive events will happen. People can control <b>their</b> <b>anxiety</b> and other negative emotions if they believe they are better off than others. People tend to focus on finding information that supports what they want to see happen, rather than what will happen to them. With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, because that is what they would like the outcome to be. This also {{suggests that}} people might lower their risks compared to others to make themselves look better than average: they are less at risk than others and therefore better.|$|E

25|$|It {{was evident}} that the people at large, with their respect for the law and <b>their</b> <b>anxiety</b> for their own homes, were tired of the war. Only those men, such as Cromwell, who have set their hearts on {{fighting}} out the quarrel of conscience, kept steadfastly to their purpose. Cromwell himself had already decided that the King himself must be deprived of his authority, and his supporters were equally convinced. But they were relatively few. Even the Eastern Association trained bands had joined in the disaffection in Waller's army. The unfortunate general's suggestion of a professional army, with all its dangers, indicated {{the only means of}} enforcing a peace, such as Cromwell and his friends desired.|$|E
25|$|Mikulincer, Shaver, and Pereg contend these {{strategies}} of regulating attachment anxiety {{have very different}} consequences. The security-based strategy leads to more positive thoughts, such as more positive explanations of why others behave {{in a particular way}} and more positive memories about people and events. More positive thoughts can encourage more creative responses to difficult problems or distressing situations. The hyperactivation and attachment avoidance strategies lead to more negative thoughts and less creativity in handling problems and stressful situations. It is notable that the security-based strategy is contingent on a positive response from their attachment. From this perspective, it would benefit people to have attachments who are willing and able to respond positively to the person's request for closeness, so that they can use security-based strategies for dealing with <b>their</b> <b>anxiety.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, often {{shortened}} to TMAS, {{is a test}} {{of anxiety}} as a personality trait, and was created by Janet Taylor in 1953 to identify subjects who would be useful {{in the study of}} anxiety disorders. The TMAS originally consisted of 50 true or false questions a person answers by reflecting on themselves, in order to determine <b>their</b> <b>anxiety</b> level. Janet Taylor spent her career in the field of psychology studying anxiety and gender development. Her scale has often been used to separate normal participants from those who would be considered to have pathological anxiety levels. The TMAS has been shown to have high test-retest reliability. The test is for adults but in 1956 a children's form was developed. The test was very popular for many years after its development but is now used infrequently.|$|E

25|$|Sparked by {{the alleged}} rape {{of a white}} woman by a black man and {{the murder of a}} white engineer, {{supposedly}} also by a black man, in Springfield, and reportedly angered by the high degree of corruption in the city, some white residents took <b>their</b> <b>anxiety</b> and frustration out on blacks. Rioting broke out on August 14, 1908 and continued for three days in a period of violence known as the Springfield Race Riot. Gangs of white youth and blue-collar workers attacked the predominantly black areas of the city known as the Levee district, where most black businesses were located, and the Badlands, where many black residences stood. Two blacks were lynched and four whites were killed by gunfire when black property-owners sought to defend their homes and businesses. The riot ended when the governor sent in more than 3,700 militiamen to patrol the city, but isolated incidents of white violence against blacks continued in Springfield into September.|$|E
25|$|In 1788, Tipu {{ordered his}} {{governor}} in Calicut Sher Khan {{to begin the}} process of converting Hindus to Islam, and in July of that year, 200 Brahmins were forcibly converted and made to eat beef. Mohibbul Hasan, Prof. Sheikh Ali, and other historians cast great doubt on the scale of the deportations and forced conversions in Coorg in particular, and Hasan says that the British versions of what happened were intended to malign Tipu Sultan, and to be used as propaganda against him. He argues that little reliance can be placed in Muslim accounts such as Kirmani's Nishan-e Haidari; in <b>their</b> <b>anxiety</b> to represent the Sultan as a champion of Islam, they had a tendency to exaggerate and distort the facts: Kirmani claims that 70,000 Coorgis were converted, when forty years later the entire population of Coorg was still less than that number. According to Ramchandra Rao Punganuri the true number of converts was about 500.|$|E

2500|$|Although the CMAS {{proved to}} not have a {{feminine}} bias, Quarter and Laxer found that females tend to score higher on the TMAS than their male counterparts. An example of these questions endorsed more frequently by females is, “I cry easily”. Similarly, Goodstein and Goldberger found that 17 of the 38 questions {{were more likely to}} be endorsed by females than males. [...] Gall found that when she tested the femininity versus masculinity qualities of men and women, then compared them to the TMAS score, the people that were more feminine, either male or female, were more likely to have a positive correlation with <b>their</b> <b>anxiety</b> level score. Based on this, Gall agreed with previous research that stated the TMAS is more strongly female based. Hafner, however, found that the CMAS does not reflect the gender difference as the girls that took the children’s test only scored higher than the boys consistently on two of the questions.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{have often}} {{expressed}} {{the opinion that}} the film is a social commentary that is reflecting the issues of Japanese society {{towards the end of}} the 20th century. Some viewers see Battle Royale as a satire of the Japanese economy during the Lost Decade. Others view it as a criticism of the Japanese educational system, such as the issues of school violence and its failings to prepare students for the extremely competitive Japanese employment market that favors elitism, in which students must partake in fiercely competitive nationwide examinations in order to secure a spot into the more distinguished universities, as these will guarantee student placement into better careers. Other interpretations include the Japanese generational attitudes that is creating social, political and economic divides between the young and old. Fukasaku himself has stated: [...] "The children who have grown up and witnessed what happened to the adults, <b>their</b> <b>anxiety</b> became heightened as well. So I set Battle Royale within this context of children versus adults." ...|$|E
