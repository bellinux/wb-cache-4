She also has expressed some pride in being born in an Italian community in Tunisia, and celebrates Tunisia's Arabic culture– as evidenced by her book Ma <b>Tunisie</b> and {{by the fact that}} she appeared as herself in the Tunisian film Un été à La Goulette ("A Summer in La Goulette"). She has been a UNESCO goodwill ambassador for the Defence of Women's Rights since March 2000, and was a goodwill ambassador for the UNESCO World Water Day for 2006.|$|E

25|$|In {{northwest}} Tunisia the Khroumir tribe episodically launched raids {{into the}} surrounding countryside. In Spring of 1881 they raided {{across the border into}} French Algeria. France responded by invading Tunisia, sending in an army of about 36,000. Their advance to Tunis was rapidly executed. The Bey was soon compelled {{to come to terms with}} the French conquest of the country, in the first of a series of treaties. These documents provided that the Bey continue as head of state, but with the French given effective control over a great deal of Tunisian governance, in the form of the Protectorat français en <b>Tunisie.</b>|$|E
25|$|Settlers {{expressed}} their views {{in their political}} and cultural associations, and commercial trade groups. Newspapers and magazines in French were published by and for the settler communities, e.g., La <b>Tunisie</b> Française. These various forums enabled the individual settler to follow discussions that articulated their hopes and anxieties, to read journalists whose reports were pitched to their points of view, and to discern the talking points of their politicians, all of which enhanced their solidarity and effectiveness. Settler interests could be diverse across the gamut of social issues at home in France, while in North Africa they united for the struggle to defend their common advantages and privileges.|$|E

2500|$|Their work soon {{attracted}} {{the interest of}} both public opinion and wealthy landowners and businessmen (preponderants) who had a strong influence on the colonial administration. Hostile to their daring plea, the preponderants wrote in La <b>Tunisie</b> française: [...] "Mr Bourguiba proposes to transform the Destourian lament into a doctoral thesis in law. The claims are not modest [...] They must be demanded to tone down their Voix du Tunisien".

2500|$|La Voix du Tunisien {{became a}} very popular {{newspaper}} because of the originality with which Bourguiba, Sfar, Guiga and Materi addressed problems. They stood out from their Destour elders by their new ways of thinking. Bourguiba reckoned {{the end of the}} protectorate as the outcome of an evolution that had taken its roots in the very principles of French civilization, unlike Abdelaziz Thâalbi, who thought of it as a breakup, in an article he wrote in La <b>Tunisie</b> martyre. Referred to as the [...] "four musketeers", they were in favor of the intangibility of national personality and political sovereignty of the Tunisian people with a progressive emancipation of the country, while advocating for a nationalism that struggled against a regime and not a civilization.|$|E
2500|$|Bourguiba {{was officially}} born on August 3, 1903 in Monastir. However, {{there was a}} strong {{uncertainty}} related to his date of birth. According to his biographies, his date of birth may have been falsified in order to rejuvenate him, certain families avoiding to declare too early the birth of a boy in order to avoid circumcision, according to Samya El Mechat in her book La <b>Tunisie</b> et les chemins vers l'indépendance. 1945–1956 (Tunisia on the roads of independence. 1945–56). During a conference he gave on October 12, 1973, Bourguiba stated that they referred to his birth with that of his cousin, Chedli Zouiten, being nine months older than him. He concluded that his birthday might be on August 3, 1902. Nevertheless, the doubt remained since he might actually be born in 1901 or even 1898. In 1955, Bourguiba declared: [...] "I was born in 1901. But when I enrolled in law school in Paris, circa 1924, the secretary made a mistake and wrote 1903. As I were not a young student, I was satisfied with this date of birth and kept it". One of his ministers, Mahmoud El Materi, confirmed this hypothesis in his memoirs.|$|E
