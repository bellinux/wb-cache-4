5|$|Northeast Pacific {{resident}} groups {{tend to be}} {{much more}} vocal than transient groups in the same waters. Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum salmon, species that are insensitive to killer whale calls (inferred from the audio-gram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the marine mammal prey of <b>transients</b> hear well underwater at the frequencies used in killer whale calls. As such, <b>transients</b> are typically silent, probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey. They sometimes use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting.|$|E
5|$|Dialects of {{killer whales}} not only {{distinguish}} them between pods, but also between types. Resident dialects contain seven to 17 (mean = 11) distinctive call types. All {{members of the}} North American west coast transient community express the same basic dialect, although minor regional variation in call types is evident. Preliminary research indicates offshore killer whales have group-specific dialects unlike those of residents and <b>transients.</b>|$|E
30|$|When the <b>transient</b> {{detector}} {{signals the}} occurrence of a <b>transient</b> in a frame, the <b>transient</b> analysis module becomes active. On basis of the input signal and the received <b>transient</b> start position, it first determines {{the character of the}} <b>transient.</b> If the <b>transient</b> phenomenon is shorter than the analysis frame lengths used in the sinusoidal and noise analysis (typically in the order of tens of milliseconds), a Meixner modeling stage becomes active. Otherwise, the <b>transient</b> is designated as a step <b>transient</b> and no separate modeling is applied. Instead, the <b>transient</b> position information is used in the sinusoidal and noise analysis for window adaptation.|$|R

5|$|In {{the classic}} {{analysis}} by Edward Lorenz (the Lorenz Energy Cycle), extratropical cyclones (so-called atmospheric <b>transients)</b> {{acts as a}} mechanism in converting potential energy that is created by pole to equator temperature gradients to eddy kinetic energy. In the process, the pole-equator temperature gradient is reduced (i.e. energy is transported poleward to warm up the higher latitudes).|$|E
5|$|Like most felines, the bobcat {{is largely}} solitary, but ranges often overlap. Unusual for cats, males are more {{tolerant}} of overlap, while females rarely wander into others' ranges. Given their smaller range sizes, two or more females may reside within a male's home range. When multiple territories overlap, a dominance hierarchy is often established, resulting in the exclusion of some <b>transients</b> from favored areas.|$|E
5|$|Offshore: A third {{population}} of killer whales {{in the northeast}} Pacific was discovered in 1988, when a humpback whale researcher observed them in open water. As their name suggests, they travel far from shore and feed primarily on schooling fish. However, because they have large, scarred and nicked dorsal fins resembling those of mammal-hunting <b>transients,</b> {{it may be that}} they also eat mammals and sharks. They have mostly been encountered off the west coast of Vancouver Island and near Haida Gwaii. Offshores typically congregate in groups of 20–75, with occasional sightings of larger groups of up to 200. Currently, little is known about their habits, but they are genetically distinct from residents and <b>transients.</b> Offshores appear to be smaller than the others, and females are characterized by dorsal fin tips that are continuously rounded.|$|E

30|$|The {{bit stream}} {{contains}} <b>transient</b> information. First of all, <b>transient</b> positions are transmitted {{together with a}} type parameter. There are two types: a step-like <b>transient</b> and a Meixner <b>transient.</b> In both cases, the <b>transient</b> position is used to generate adapted overlap-add windows for the sinusoidal and noise synthesis. Thus this information is shared by the three synthesizers TrS, SiS, and NoS.|$|R
5|$|The {{existence}} of such <b>transients</b> are also {{closely related to the}} formation of the Icelandic and Aleutian Low — the two most prominent general circulation features in the mid- to sub-polar northern latitudes. The two lows are formed by both the transport of kinetic energy and the latent heating (the energy released when water phase changed from vapor to liquid during precipitation) from the extratropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|The {{identified}} seven ecotypes inhabit isolated ecological niches. Of three orca ecotypes in the Antarctic, one preys on minke whales, {{the second}} on seals and penguins {{and the third}} on fish. Another ecotype lives in the eastern North Atlantic, while the three Northeast Pacific ecotypes are labeled the transient, resident and offshore populations, as discussed above. The research supported a proposal to reclassify the Antarctic seal- and fish-eating populations and the North Pacific <b>transients</b> as a distinct species, leaving the remaining ecotypes as subspecies. The first split in the orca population, between the North Pacific <b>transients</b> and the rest, occurred an estimated 700,000 years ago. Such a designation would mean that each new species becomes subject to separate conservation assessments.|$|E

Noise {{is an important}} component of the sound of the human voice and all musical instruments, particularly in unpitched percussion instruments and electric guitars (using distortion). Electronic instruments create various colours of noise. Traditional uses of noise are unrestricted, using all the frequencies associated with pitch and timbre, such as the white noise component of a drum roll on a snare drum, or the <b>transients</b> present in the prefix of the sounds of some organ pipes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Classical {{mammalian}} <b>transient</b> receptor potential channels form non-selective cation {{channels that}} open {{in response to}} activation of phospholipase C-coupled metabotropic receptors, and are thought to {{play a key role}} in calcium homeostasis in non-excitable cells. Within the nervous system <b>transient</b> receptor potential channels are widely distributed but their physiological roles are not well understood. Here we show that in the rat lateral amygdala <b>transient</b> receptor potential channels mediate an excitatory synaptic response to glutamate. Activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors on pyramidal neurons in the lateral amygdala with either exogenous or synaptically released glutamate evokes an inward current at negative potentials with a current voltage relationship showing a region of negative slope and steep outward rectification. This current is blocked by inhibiting G protein function with GTP-�-S, by inhibiting phospholipase C or by infusing <b>transient</b> receptor potential antibodies into lateral amygdala pyramidal neurons. Using RT-PCR and Western blotting we show that <b>transient</b> receptor potential 1, <b>transient</b> receptor potential 4 and <b>transient</b> receptor potential 5 are present in the lateral amygdala.

5|$|The Exxon Valdez {{oil spill}} {{adversely}} affected killer whales in Prince William Sound and Alaska's Kenai Fjords region. Eleven members (about half) of one resident pod {{disappeared in the}} following year. The spill damaged salmon and other prey populations, which in turn damaged local killer whales.

5|$|Types B and C live {{close to}} the ice pack, and diatoms in these waters may be {{responsible}} for the yellowish coloring of both types. Mitochondrial DNA sequences support the theory that these are recently diverged separate species. More recently, complete mitochondrial sequencing indicates the two Antarctic groups that eat seals and fish should be recognized as distinct species, as should the North Pacific <b>transients,</b> leaving the others as subspecies pending additional data. Advanced methods that sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome revealed systematic differences in DNA between different populations.|$|E
5|$|A Great Eruption event {{similar to}} Eta Carinae A's {{has only been}} {{observed}} in one other star in the Milky Way—P Cygni—and {{in a handful of}} other possible LBVs in external galaxies. None of them seem to be quite as violent as Eta Carinae's. It is unclear if this is something that only a very few of the most massive LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or a very brief but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal <b>transients</b> that approach the brightness of a supernova.|$|E

However, some <b>transient</b> voltage stability indexes are not suitable for dynamic VAR planning. Therefore, a good and suitable <b>transient</b> voltage stability can be well used in the dynamic VAR planning optimization and enhance failure recovery for power system after faults.|$|R
5|$|The {{physical}} and biological mechanism of LTP {{is still not}} understood, but some successful models have been developed. Studies of dendritic spines, protruding structures on dendrites that physically grow and retract {{over the course of}} minutes or hours, have suggested a relationship between the electrical resistance of the spine and the effective synapse strength, due to their relationship with intracellular calcium <b>transients.</b> Mathematical models such as BCM Theory, which depends also on intracellular calcium in relation to NMDA receptor voltage gates, have been developed since the 1980s and modify the traditional a priori Hebbian learning model with both biological and experimental justification. Still others have proposed re-arranging or synchronizing the relationship between receptor regulation, LTP, and synaptic strength.|$|E
5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to <b>transients,</b> such as when first energised.|$|E
5|$|Villani {{states that}} the whole {{population}} of Florence—men, women, and children—in reference to the years 1336 to 1338, {{was estimated to be}} 90,000 due to the amount of bread needed daily.

A black bean was deposited for every male child baptized and a white bean deposited for every female child baptized in the Florence Baptistry—from these baptisms the average annual birth rate was figured at 5,500 to 6,000. Villani pointed out that the newborn males often outnumbered the newborn females by 300 to 500 on each count. He noted that in his day the adult, male citizen population of the city was about 25,000 (those between the age of fifteen and seventy who could bear arms); 1,500 of these were noble and upper class citizens.
