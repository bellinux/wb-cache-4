5|$|Having {{been given}} top {{priority}} by the Air Force, {{the first flight}} test of <b>the</b> <b>Bold</b> Orion missile was conducted on May 26, 1958, from a Boeing B-47 Stratojet carrier aircraft, which launched <b>the</b> <b>Bold</b> Orion vehicle {{at the apex of}} a high-speed, high-angle climb. The zoom climb tactic, combined with the thrust from the rocket motor of the missile itself, allowed the missile to achieve its maximum range, or, alternatively, to reach space.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bold</b> Orion missile, {{also known}} as Weapons System 199B (WS-199B), was a {{prototype}} air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) developed by Martin Aircraft during the 1950s. Developed in both one- and two-stage designs, the missile was moderately successful in testing, and helped {{pave the way for}} development of the GAM-87 Skybolt ALBM. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Bold</b> Orion was used in early anti-satellite weapons testing, performing the first interception of a satellite by a missile.|$|E

5|$|The {{designation}} WS-199B {{was assigned}} to the project that, under a contract awarded in 1958 to Martin Aircraft, would become <b>the</b> <b>Bold</b> Orion missile. The design of Bold Orion was simple, using parts developed for other missile systems to reduce the cost and development time of the project. The initial Bold Orion configuration was a single-stage vehicle, using a Thiokol TX-20 Sergeant solid-fuel rocket. Following initial testing, <b>the</b> <b>Bold</b> Orion configuration was altered to become a two-stage vehicle, an Allegany Ballistics Laboratory Altair upper stage being added to the missile.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} <b>the</b> <b>Bold</b> Orion project, {{along with those}} from the testing of the High Virgo missile, also {{developed}} under WS-199, provided data and knowledge that assisted the Air Force in forming the requirements for the follow-on WS-138A, which would produce the GAM-87 Skybolt missile.|$|E

In 1401, during one of the King's absences, Orléans installed his own men to collect royal revenues, angering Philip <b>the</b> <b>Bold</b> who in retaliation raised an army, threatening to enter Paris with 600 men-at-arms and 60 knights. At that time Isabeau intervened between Orléans and Burgundy, preventing bloodshed and the outbreak of civil war.|$|E
5|$|Following the Mongol {{invasion}} of Central Asia {{and the subsequent}} collapse of the Khwarezmian Empire, a Mongol force {{under the command of}} generals Jebe and Subutai advanced into Iraq-i Ajam. Jebe requested permission from the Mongolian emperor, Genghis Khan, to continue his conquests for a few years before returning to the main army via the Caucasus. While waiting for Genghis Khan's reply, the duo set out on a raid in which they attacked Georgia and killed its king. Genghis Khan granted the duo permission to undertake their expedition, and after making their way through the Caucasus, they defeated a coalition of Caucasian tribes before defeating the Cumans. The Cuman Khan fled to the court of his son-in-law, Prince Mstislav <b>the</b> <b>Bold</b> of Galich, whom he convinced to help fight the Mongols.

5|$|In the 14th century, as Gothic art {{gave way}} to the International Gothic era, a number of schools {{developed}} in northern Europe. Early Netherlandish art originated in French courtly art, and is especially tied to the tradition and conventions of illuminated manuscripts. Modern art historians see the era as beginning with 14th-century manuscript illuminators. They were followed by panel painters such as Melchior Broederlam and Robert Campin, the latter generally considered the first Early Netherlandish master, under whom van der Weyden served his apprenticeship. Illumination reached a peak in the region in the decades after 1400, mainly due to the patronage of Burgundian and House of Valois-Anjou dukes such as Philip <b>the</b> <b>Bold,</b> Louis I of Anjou and Jean, Duke of Berry. This patronage continued in the low countries with the Burgundian dukes, Philip the Good and his son Charles <b>the</b> <b>Bold.</b> The demand for illuminated manuscripts declined {{towards the end of the}} century, perhaps because of the costly production process in comparison to panel painting. Yet illumination remained popular at the luxury end of the market, and prints, both engravings and woodcuts, found a new mass market, especially those by artists such as Martin Schongauer and Albrecht Dürer.|$|E
5|$|In the empire, Frederick {{faced the}} {{opposition}} of the Bavarian Wittelsbach dynasty and of his cousin Sigismund, who was duke in Tyrol, Vorarlberg, and Further Austria then. Sigismund had been {{in conflict with the}} Swiss Confederacy, too. When he had been banned by Pope Pius II in a conflict over the nomination of a bishop in Tyrol, the Swiss had annexed the formerly Habsburg territories of the Thurgau. In 1468, Sigismund clashed with the Swiss in the War of Waldshut, which he could end without significant territorial losses only by paying a large ransom, which he financed by pawning territories in the Sundgau and the Alsace to Charles <b>the</b> <b>Bold</b> of Burgundy in 1469. Charles did not, however, help Sigismund against the Swiss, and so Sigismund bought back the territories in 1474 and concluded a peace treaty with the Confederacy, the Ewige Richtung, although the emperor never recognized it. In the following Burgundy Wars, the Swiss and Sigismund both fought against Charles <b>the</b> <b>Bold.</b>|$|E

Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles <b>the</b> <b>Bold</b> died in 1477, the export market became more important.
