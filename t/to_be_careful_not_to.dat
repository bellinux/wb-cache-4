I take no offense at {{the way they have}} conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{cautions}} that we cannot feel or intuit {{this world of}} the understanding. He also stresses that {{we are unable to}} make interesting positive claims about it because we are not able to experience the world of the understanding. Kant argues that we cannot use the notion of the world of the understanding to explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason could {{have anything to say about}} practical matters because we simply do not and cannot have a clear enough grasp of the world of the understanding. The notion of an intelligible world does point us towards the idea of a kingdom of ends, which is a useful and important idea. We just have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> get carried away and make claims that we are not entitled to.|$|E
25|$|By {{design the}} trireme {{was meant for}} day-long journeys, with no {{capacity}} to stay at sea overnight or carry the necessary provisions to sustain the men it carried. There were, however, storage facilities on board large enough to provide each crewman with the 2 gallons (7.6 L) of fresh drinking water {{he would need to}} stay hydrated each day. This meant that all those aboard were dependent upon the land and peoples of where they landed each night for supplies. Sometimes this would entail traveling up to eighty kilometres in order to procure the necessary provisions. In the Peloponnesian War, the beached Athenian fleet was caught unawares on more than one occasion, while out looking for food (Battle of Syracuse and Battle of Aegospotami). The cities, which suddenly found themselves needing to provide for all these sailors were usually agreeable and did not mind the extra business, but those in charge of the fleet and/or mission had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> completely deplete the 'host' city of resources.|$|E

500|$|... "The Moth" [...] {{aired on}} November 3, 2004. The episode was {{directed}} by Jack Bender and written by Jennifer Johnson and Paul Dini. The church scene with Charlie and Liam at the church in Manchester was actually filmed on Honolulu, where the scenes on the Island are filmed. Monaghan says that he feels Charlie's black hoodie {{is a sort of}} [...] "security blanket" [...] that he hides underneath and uses it when he feels [...] "lost." [...] The [...] "heroin" [...] that Charlie is supposedly snorting is actually brown sugar. Monaghan revealed this in an interview with Stuff magazine in October 2005, saying, [...] " [...] brown sugar. You get some really sweet boogers. You have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> snort too much of it, but it's happened a few times. You just find dessert up your nose couple of hours later." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Lionel Steketee, [...] "Mylène [...] very professional, thorough, {{discreet}} {{and almost}} shy" [...] when she {{participated in the}} shooting of the video. He said she had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> get scratched by the cat, and that the final scene was difficult to film because the cats were afraid of the water used in this scene, the rats remained hidden {{in a corner and}} the birds did not fly much. Given that the song deals with the pain caused by the absence of a dead person, the video is unrelated to the lyrics, as noted by author Alice Novak. In reviews, Yahoo! Music said that, through the video, [...] " [...] invites us into her dark and magical universe", and Premiere deemed it [...] "mysterious, provocative". Considering it a short film, Cachin praised the music video as being [...] "perfectly done".|$|E
500|$|Test {{screenings}} for {{the film}} were encouraging for 20th Century Fox. Joe Roth, then president of the company, considered marketing Edward Scissorhands {{on the scale of}} [...] "an E.T.-sized blockbuster," [...] but Roth decided not to aggressively promote the film in that direction. [...] "We have to let it find its place. We want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> hype the movie out of the universe," [...] he reasoned. Edward Scissorhands had its limited release in the United States on December 7, 1990. The wide release came on December 14, and the film earned $6,325,249 in its opening weekend in 1,372 theaters. Edward Scissorhands eventually grossed $56,362,352 in North America, and a further $29,661,653 outside North America, coming to a worldwide total of $86.02 million. With a budget of $20 million, the film was declared to be a box office success. The New York Times wrote [...] "the chemistry between Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder, who were both together in real life at the time (1989–1993), gave the film teen idol potential, drawing younger audiences." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Hungry Earth" [...] and [...] "Cold Blood" [...] made up {{the fourth}} {{production}} block of the series and were filmed in late October and November 2009 in the Upper Boat Studios and Llanwynno, Wales. [...] "Cold Blood" [...] utilised many different locations and unusual sets to portray the Silurian city, as the production team did not want simply a [...] "cave feel". They believed that the Silurians were also sophisticated {{and were able to}} use materials found underground, such as granite and marble. Many of the sets were given an orange glow from beneath to portray the [...] "ambient glow" [...] from the centre of the earth. The jungle walkway leading to the Silurian city was filmed in the Plantasia botanical garden in Swansea on 13 November 2009. The set gave a sense of things growing, as these were necessary for the Silurians to survive. Set designers were able to rearrange the plants, though they had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> show the window leading to the car park or other modern amenities. The hall where the Doctor is brought for execution was filmed at the Temple of Peace in Cardiff, and little dressing was done to the set.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the episode's airing, NBC {{set up a}} {{web site}} for the new Michael Scott Paper Company at www.michaelscottpapercompany.com, which {{included}} a mission statement for the company, photos of the new office space and a downloadable copy of the coupon for [...] "unparalleled customer service" [...] featured in the episode. The official website for The Office included four cut scenes from [...] "Michael Scott Paper Company" [...] {{within a week of}} the episode's original release. In one 85-second clip, Dwight and Andy pretend to shoot, stab and throw grenades at each other in pantomime in anticipation of their hunting trip; they pretend to kill Jim and pester him until he plays dead, after which Charles walks in and believes he is napping. A second one-minute clip includes Pam and Ryan fighting around the new office until they are interrupted by a janitor who believes the room is still a closet and leaves water jugs on the floor. In a third, 40-second clip, Jim asks Charles directly what a [...] "run-down" [...] is, but when an annoyed Charles asks if this is [...] "one of your pranks", Jim gives up and leaves. The fourth and final clip, which is 85 seconds long, features Andy and Dwight both making passes at Erin; Andy discusses how easy it would be to learn sign language, while Dwight tells her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> get her hair or clothes caught in the nearby paper shredder.|$|E

2500|$|The greater {{length of}} the 85mm gun barrel (4.645 meters) made it {{necessary}} for crews <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> plough it into the ground on bumpy roads or in combat. Tank commander A.K. Rodkin commented: [...] "the tank could have dug the ground {{with it in the}} smallest ditch [...] If you fired it after that, the barrel would open up at the end like the petals of a flower", destroying the barrel. Standard practice when moving the T-34-85 cross-country in non-combat situations was to fully elevate the gun, or reverse the turret.|$|E

Portland Hoffa was once given a line about wasting an afternoon at the rodeo. NBC objected to the implication that an afternoon at the rodeo was wasted and the line had to be changed. Another time, Allen gagged that a girl could have found a better husband in a cemetery. (The censor) thought this might hurt the feelings of people who own and operate cemeteries. Allen got the line cleared only after pointing out that cemeteries have been topics for comedy {{since the time of}} Aristophanes."

2500|$|..... Greenstreet {{chatters}} {{about the}} falcon {{while waiting for}} a drugged drink to knock out Bogart. Huston's strategy is crafty. Earlier, Greenstreet has set it up by making a point: [...] "I distrust a man who says 'when.'

[...] Now he offers Bogart a drink, but Bogart doesn't sip from it. Greenstreet talks on, and tops up Bogart's glass. He still doesn't drink. Greenstreet watches him narrowly. They discuss the value of the missing black bird. Finally, Bogart drinks, and passes out. The timing is everything; Huston doesn't give us closeups of the glass to underline the possibility that it's drugged. He depends on the situation to generate the suspicion in our minds.|$|E

2500|$|Alexei {{inherited}} hemophilia {{from his}} mother Alexandra, a condition that could {{be traced back to}} her maternal grandmother Queen Victoria. In 2009 genetic analysis determined specifically that he suffered from hemophilia B. He had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> injure himself because he lacked factor IX, one of the proteins necessary for blood-clotting. According to his French tutor, Pierre Gilliard, the nature of his illness was kept a state secret. [...] His hemophilia was so severe that trivial injuries such as a bruise, a nosebleed or a cut were potentially life-threatening. [...] Two navy sailors were assigned to him to monitor and supervise him to prevent injuries, which were still unavoidable. [...] They also carried him around when he was unable to walk. As well as being a source of constant torment to his parents, the recurring episodes of illness and long recoveries interfered greatly with Alexei's education.|$|E

The judge held there was no actual bias whatsoever justifying the recusal application. She further held that judges have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> accede too readily to suggestions of actual bias by litigants who do not want particular judges to hear their cases, as this would encourage parties to believe that by seeking the disqualification of judges they would have their cases tried by other judges thought more likely to decide the cases in their favour.

[...] Although Colorado law already defined marriage as being {{between a man and}} a woman, Haggard and other gay marriage opponents sought to enshrine the prohibition in the state constitution, so that the Colorado Supreme Court would not have the power to declare the statute unconstitutional. [...] In the movie Jesus Camp, Haggard says, [...] "we don't have to debate about what we should think about homosexual activity. It's written in the Bible." [...] Haggard initially opposed same-sex marriage, but supported civil unions for homosexual couples.
