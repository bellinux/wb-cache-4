5|$|Students' {{answers to}} the free-response section are {{reviewed}} in early June by readers that include {{high school and college}} statistics teachers gathered in a designated location. The readers use a pre-made rubric to assess <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> and normally grade only one question in a given exam. Each question is graded on a scale from 0 to 4, with a 4 representing the most complete response. Communication and clarity in <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> receive a lot of emphasis in the grading.|$|E
5|$|Jeopardy! was not {{the first}} game show to give contestants <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> and require the questions. That format had {{previously}} been used by the Gil Fates-hosted program CBS Television Quiz, which aired from July 1941 until May 1942.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E
5|$|Clark left Cambridge {{at the age}} of 18 to {{join the}} Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as an officer. During initial {{training}} at HMS Collingwood, near Portsmouth, Clark discovered that he was colour blind and only passed the medical examination by persuading the man sitting behind him to whisper <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to him. Clark served aboard HMS Fleetwood on convoy escort operations in the Atlantic and Mediterranean before attending HMS King Alfred at Hove. Whilst there his colour blindness was discovered and he was banned from seagoing postings.|$|E

5|$|In May 1645, Parliament {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} allowing excommunicants {{to appeal the}} church's sentences to Parliament. Another ordinance on 20October contained a list of sins to which the church would be limited in its power to excommunicate. To {{the majority of the}} divines' dismay, an even more Erastian ordinance was proposed in March 1646. The Assembly published a protest, provoking the Commons to charge it with breach of privilege and to submit nine questions to the divines on the matter. Votes were to be included with <b>the</b> <b>answers,</b> an attempt to force the divines associated with the protest petition to reveal themselves.|$|E
5|$|The Deep Impact {{mission was}} planned to help answer {{fundamental}} questions about comets, which included what {{makes up the}} composition of the comet's nucleus, what depth the crater would reach from the impact, and where the comet originated in its formation. By observing {{the composition of the}} comet, astronomers hoped to determine how comets form based on the differences between the interior and exterior makeup of the comet. Observations of the impact and its aftermath would allow astronomers to attempt to determine <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to these questions.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett finds a strange, disfigured man (Chris Owens) in the X-Files office and, on his whim, they test his DNA. They learn that the man shares DNA with Fox Mulder (Duchovny), and may possibly even be him. <b>The</b> <b>answers</b> become even more surprising when Scully's son, baby William, is put on the line.|$|E
5|$|Although MalcolmX {{retained}} {{final approval}} of their hybrid text, {{he was not}} privy to the actual editorial processes superimposed from Haley's side. The Library of Congress held <b>the</b> <b>answers.</b> This collection includes the papers of Doubleday's then-executive editor, Kenneth McCormick, who had worked closely with Haley for several years as the Autobiography had been constructed. As in the Romaine papers, I found more evidence of Haley's sometimes-weekly private commentary with McCormick about the laborious process of composing the book. They also revealed how several attorneys retained by Doubleday closely monitored and vetted entire sections of the controversial text in 1964, demanding numerous name changes, the reworking and deletion of blocks of paragraphs, and so forth. In late 1963, Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as MalcolmX's anti-Semitism. He therefore rewrote material to eliminate a number of negative statements about Jews in the book manuscript, with the explicit covert goal of 'getting them past MalcolmX,' without his coauthor's knowledge or consent. Thus, the censorship of MalcolmX had begun well prior to his assassination.|$|E

The Deltas fail the exam, and their grade-point averages fall so low that Wormer tells them he needs only one more incident to revoke their charter. To cheer themselves up, the Deltas organize a toga party and bring in Otis Day and the Knights to provide live music. Wormer's wife attends at Otter's invitation and has sex with him. Pinto hooks up with Clorette, a girl he met at the supermarket. They make out, but do not have sex because she passes out drunk. Pinto takes her home in a shopping cart and later discovers {{that she is the}} mayor's daughter.|$|E
50|$|Counter Strategy by the Seller:The Seller (who {{may or may}} {{not know}} <b>the</b> <b>answer)</b> would pretend that he knows <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> and is trustworthy. He would also try to guess whether the Player {{actually}} knows <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> or is bluffing. If the Seller feels that the Player knows <b>the</b> <b>answer,</b> <b>the</b> Seller may have no option but to agree to the Player’s offer. But, if the Seller feels that the Player is bluffing, he would keep on increasing his bid. If the final amount agreed by the Player is not satisfactory to the Seller, he may give a misleading <b>answer</b> to <b>the</b> Player (remember the Seller would anyway get the agreed amount whether <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> is right or wrong). The Player then would have to decide whether to go with <b>the</b> sellers <b>answer</b> or not. If the Player goes with <b>the</b> Seller’s misleading <b>answer,</b> <b>the</b> player would have successfully sought revenge on the Seller for offering a very small amount.|$|R
50|$|A typical clue {{consists}} of two parts, the definition and the wordplay.

5|$|Her {{most infamous}} antic was giving Ozy a haircut only to accidentally shave off all his fur. Although she is {{normally}} manic, {{she also has}} a strong sense of justice, facing the inexplicable wrongs of life and the world she sees. However, her rebellions are mostly limited to annoying her mother, playing jokes on Ozy and disrupting the peace at school. None of which matters any less to her, as long as she has fun doing it. Millie says aloud what others think, and does what others, for fear of reaction from the people around them, would not dare. She, like Ozy, often tries to answer the most important questions in life, but her method of finding <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> makes her unique.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Winger, a disbarred lawyer, has {{enrolled}} at Greendale Community College {{as a condition}} for getting his license back. His plan is to use his friendship with Dr. Ian Duncan to obtain test answers. In the cafeteria Jeff meets the attractive Britta, and (in an attempt to get closer to her) convinces her to join his non-existent Spanish study group. As the study group convenes, Jeff pretends the other members simply did not show up. Britta, however, has invited Abed to join them. Jeff unsuccessfully tries to make him leave, and then gets called to the football field by Dr. Duncan. The professor makes a futile attempt to appeal to Jeff's conscience, and eventually agrees to provide <b>the</b> <b>answers.</b> Jeff returns to the study group, discovering that Abed has also invited Troy, Shirley, Pierce and Annie. Finding Britta smoking outside, he suggests the two study alone, but she persuades him to return.|$|E

To prepare for the contest, Munna's sidekick Circuit (Arshad Warsi) kidnaps and bribes a group of professors to provide <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> for Munna. After winning the contest, Munna is granted an interview with Janhavi wherein he presents himself as a professor of history and a Gandhi specialist.

To prepare for this event, Munna engages in intense study at a Gandhi institute. For three days and nights (and without food or sleep), Munna reads about the life and ideologies of Gandhi.|$|E
