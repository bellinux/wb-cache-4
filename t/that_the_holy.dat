5|$|In May 1908, five American missionaries—John G. Lake and Thomas Hezmalhalch, {{along with}} their wives, and A. Lehman—arrived in South Africa from Indianapolis. Lake and Hezmalhalch had links to Dowie's Zion City and had been baptized in the Holy Spirit at the Azusa Street Mission in Los Angeles. Despite these influences, however, the missionaries had no {{organizational}} affiliation. Arriving in Pretoria, Lake felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Spirit was leading him to Johannesburg because they found no doors open in Pretoria. In Johannesburg, a Mrs Goodenough met them and invited them to stay in her house. She witnessed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Spirit had sent her {{to the train station}} to meet the American missionaries. They first began ministry at a rental hall in Doornfontein, a Johannesburg suburb, on 25 May 1908. The services consisted of a mixed racial group, and many who attended the first services were Zionists. The missionaries moved to the Central Tabernacle, Bree Street, Johannesburg as the young Pentecostal movement grew. It was there that the Apostolic Faith Mission developed, initially as a committee first meeting in September 1908. It was not registered as a legal entity until 1913, however.|$|E

They eventually concluded {{that it was all}} a hoax, outlining in detail the reasons for their verdict, and giving detailed evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Blood authors had not reported comprehensively. They imply that this evidence had been ignored by Lincoln, Baigent, and Leigh to bolster the mythical version of the Priory's history that was developed by Plantard during the early 1960s after meeting author Gérard de Sède.|$|E
5|$|In 1059 {{the same}} papal bull that {{restricted}} suffrage to the cardinals also recognised {{the authority of}} the Holy Roman Emperor (at the time Henry IV), but only as a concession made by the pope, declaring <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Roman Emperor had no authority to intervene in elections except where permitted to do so by papal agreements. Pope Gregory VII (in office 1073-1085) was the last Pope to submit to the interference of the Holy Roman Emperors. The breach between him and the Holy Roman Empire caused by the Investiture Controversy led to the abolition of the Emperor's role. In 1122 the Holy Roman Empire acceded to the Concordat of Worms, accepting the papal decision.|$|E

5|$|Less {{than four}} years after his election, Metropolitan Jonah {{was asked by the}} Holy Synod, in a {{unanimous}} decision, to resign from his position. While wary of initially releasing information about the resignation, the Holy Synod felt prompted to release a public statement about his release due to rumors that had spread about their intentions. The statement they released on the official website of the OCA detailed several administrative decisions Metropolitan Jonah had made <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Synod felt put the church and its members at risk. In the statement, the Holy Synod clarified the reason they withheld information initially was to protect the reputation and integrity of Metropolitan Jonah as well as protect anyone involved in the specific decisions made by him.|$|E

5|$|Jussi {{found himself}} in the unusual {{position}} of attempting to defend a client who refused to defend himself. With no evidence at his disposal to support Feletti's testimony, he was forced to rely almost entirely on his own oratory. Jussi put forward some aspects of the sequence of events that he said suggested that orders had indeed come from Rome—for example, that Feletti had sent Edgardo straight off to the capital without seeing him—and asserted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Office and the Pope were far better placed to adjudge the validity of the baptism than a secular court. He quoted at length from Angelo Padovani's account of his meeting with Anna Morisi in July 1858, then cast doubt on the grocer Lepori's claim that he did not even know how to baptise a child—Jussi produced a police report in which Lepori was described as a close friend of a Jesuit priest. Jussi proposed that Lepori and Bussolari might both be lying to protect themselves, and that Morisi's sexual impropriety did not necessarily mean her story was false. He concluded that since Feletti had been inquisitor at the time, he had merely done what that office required him to do, and no crime had been committed.|$|E

25|$|The {{basis of}} John Bekkos’s quarrel with his contemporaries was a {{disagreement}} with {{them over the}} implications of a traditional patristic formula, that states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son (in Greek, διὰ τοῦ Υἱοῦ). Already in the ninth century, this expression was being pushed in two different directions: Latin writers saw it as implying the Augustinian doctrine <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (Filioque); Greek writers, especially {{from the time of}} Patriarch Photios onward, saw it as consistent with the view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Spirit proceeds from the Father alone. Bekkos originally agreed with the Photian view, but his reading of the Greek fathers, and of medieval Greek writers like Nicephorus Blemmydes and Nicetas of Maroneia, caused him to change his mind. Much of John XI Bekkos’s debate with Gregory II was a debate over the meaning of texts from St. Cyril and other fathers, whose wording (the Spirit “exists from the Son”; the Spirit “fountains forth eternally” from the Son, etc.) Bekkos saw as consistent with the Latin doctrine, while Gregory of Cyprus interpreted such texts as necessarily referring to an eternal manifestation of the Holy Spirit through or from the Son. This thirteenth-century debate has considerable relevance for current-day ecumenical discussions between the Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
