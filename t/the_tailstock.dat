2500|$|Lathes {{have four}} main {{components:}} the bed, the headstock, the carriage, and <b>the</b> <b>tailstock.</b> [...] The bed is a precise & very strong base {{which all of}} the other components rest upon for alignment. The headstock's spindle secures the workpiece with a chuck, whose jaws (usually three or four) are tightened around the piece. The spindle rotates at high speed, providing the energy to cut the material. While historically lathes were powered by belts from a line shaft, modern examples uses electric motors. The workpiece extends out of the spindle along the axis of rotation above the flat bed. The carriage is a platform that can be moved, precisely and independently parallel and perpendicular to the axis of rotation. A hardened cutting tool is held at the desired height (usually the middle of the workpiece) by the toolpost. The carriage is then moved around the rotating workpiece, and the cutting tool gradually removes material from the workpiece. <b>The</b> <b>tailstock</b> can be slid along the axis of rotation and then locked in place as necessary. It may hold centers to further secure the workpiece, or cutting tools driven into the end of the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tailstock</b> {{is a tool}} (drill), and centre mount, {{opposite}} the headstock. The spindle (T5) does not rotate but does travel longitudinally under the action of a leadscrew and handwheel (T1). The spindle includes a taper to hold drill bits, centers and other tooling. <b>The</b> <b>tailstock</b> can be positioned along the bed and clamped (T6) in position as dictated by the work piece. There is also provision to offset <b>the</b> <b>tailstock</b> (T4) from the spindles axis, this is useful for turning small tapers, and when re-aligning <b>the</b> <b>tailstock</b> to the axis of the bed.|$|E

50|$|The Morse taper {{was invented}} by Stephen A. Morse in the mid-1860s. Since then, it has evolved to {{encompass}} smaller and larger sizes and has been adopted as a standard by numerous organizations, including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as ISO 296 and the German Institute for Standardization (DIN) as DIN 228-1. It {{is one of the}} most widely used types, and is particularly common on the shank of taper-shank twist drills and machine reamers, in the spindles of industrial drill presses, and in <b>the</b> <b>tailstocks</b> of lathes.|$|R
50|$|The bed is {{a robust}} base that {{connects to the}} {{headstock}} and permits <b>the</b> carriage and <b>tailstock</b> to be moved parallel with the axis of the spindle. This is facilitated by hardened and ground bedways which restrain <b>the</b> carriage and <b>tailstock</b> in a set track. The carriage travels {{by means of a}} rack and pinion system. The leadscrew of accurate pitch, drives the carriage holding the cutting tool via a gearbox driven from the headstock.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the first}} uses of tapers was to mount drill bits {{directly}} to machine tools, such as in <b>the</b> <b>tailstock</b> of a lathe, although later drill chucks were invented that mounted to machine tools and in turn held non-tapered drill bits.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>tailstock</b> {{was also}} of {{completely}} new design. The quill could be fed by three different methods: Rapidly {{by a large}} starwheel, by worm reduction via a smaller handwheel, or automatically by geared connection to the saddle. The transverse adjustment of the centre was done by an eccentric mechanism. The centre was protected from overload by a spring arrangement.|$|E
50|$|Turrets can {{be added}} to non-turret lathes (bench lathes, engine lathes, toolroom lathes, etc.) by {{mounting}} them on <b>the</b> toolpost, <b>tailstock,</b> or both. Often these turrets are not as large as a turret lathe's, and they usually do not offer the sliding and stopping that a turret lathe's turret does; but they do offer the ability to index through successive tool settings.|$|R
50|$|A chuck is a {{specialized}} type of clamp. It {{is used to}} hold an object with radial symmetry, especially a cylinder. In drills and mills it holds the rotating tool whereas in lathes it holds the rotating workpiece. On a lathe the chuck is mounted on the spindle which rotates within the headstock. For some purposes (such as drilling) an additional chuck may be mounted on <b>the</b> non-rotating <b>tailstock.</b>|$|R

The victim was lifeflighted and died enroute to the hospital. The co-worker suffered non-life threatening injuries. RECOMMENDATIONS • Employers should establish, communicate and enforce a clothing policy specific to the work environment and particularly for machine operators. • Employers should establish formal training on recognized hazards, injury prevention and emergency procedures, and to communicate expectations to adhere to safe practices and policies. • Supervision should monitor, reinforce safe behaviors, and immediately correct unsafe behaviors or conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The tapping {{cutter bar}} is {{developed}} {{to replace the}} manual tapping of internal thread to obtain machining accuracy and efficiency for large batch of machining internal thread of small diameter, which is a tapping tool for machine use featuring economic and practical as well as helping {{to solve the problems}} of low efficiency, inferior accuracy and easy-breaking of tappers. 0. Preface In practical production process, machining of internal thread for large diameter can be realized by using lathe tool for internal thread, but this method is difficult to machine internal thread of parts with small diameter, which is usually done by first drilling of base hole of the thread after machining process, and then using tapper to obtain the internal thread manually or with machine. By this traditional method for internal thread processing, the processes are distracted that increases time for handling, loading and unloading. It also lead to low efficiency, low accuracy of the perpendicularity error of thread. What’s more, tapper are always likely to break during tapping process, especially for parts with small diameter, and the depth of the thread is hard to control. To solve the problems mentioned above, a new type of tapping tool for machine use is developed. The tool bar could be inserted into the tapper hole on <b>the</b> lathe <b>tailstock</b> or installed o...|$|R
50|$|A {{revolving}} center, {{also known}} as a live center in some countries, is constructed so that the 60° center runs in its own bearings and is used at <b>the</b> non-driven or <b>tailstock</b> end of a machine. It allows higher turning speeds without the need for separate lubrication, and also greater clamping pressures. CNC lathes use this type of center almost exclusively and they may be used for general machining operations as well. Spring-loaded centers are designed to compensate for center variations, without damage to the work piece or center tip. This assures the operator of uniform constant tension while machining. Some live centers also have interchangeable shafts. This is valuable when situations require a design other than a 60° male tip. A live center, which may be hard or soft, is a plain center placed in the revolving mandrel - it moves therefore is live.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} diploma thesis was to {{manufacture}} computer-controlled lathe, {{which could be}} compatible with hand wooden turning lathe. Procedure would be controlled by computer, coordinates for control of electro motor would be sent through microkontroller [...] In the first part we present all {{the theory of the}} lathe and its interaction of lathe with the workpiece. The idea of computer-controlled lathe is a stand with leadscrew, caggiage and tailstock. Tailstock is moving in the axis (X,Y) and it is moved by stepper motor, computer-controlled through microcontroller. User manual has two forms, first is for <b>the</b> callibration of <b>tailstock</b> on <b>the</b> correct place, task of the second one is to load the data (coordinates) of shape of the finished project and making one as well. Computer-controlled lathe as an independant unite is too complex for appliance in the primary school, but when dismantled to individual segments, for example leadscrew, caggiage, stepper motor, user manual … it {{can be used as a}} pedagogical instrument on the primary school level. ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{machine tool}} may have several spindles, {{such as the}} {{headstock}} and tailstock spindles on a bench lathe. The main spindle is usually the biggest one. References to [...] "the spindle" [...] without further qualification imply the main spindle. Some machine tools that specialize in high-volume mass production {{have a group of}} 4, 6, or even more main spindles. These are called multispindle machines. For example, gang drills and many screw machines are multispindle machines. Although a bench lathe has more than one spindle (counting <b>the</b> <b>tailstock),</b> it is not called a multispindle machine; it has one main spindle.|$|E
50|$|Usually, {{the entire}} {{tailstock}} is {{moved to the}} approximate position {{that it will be}} needed by manually sliding it along its ways. There, it is locked in place and the tool mounted to it is moved with a leadscrew to the exact position where it is needed. When a cutting tool such as a drill bit or reamer is used, the feed is done with this leadscrew. <b>The</b> <b>tailstock</b> quill or extendible portion usually has a Morse taper mount in the end of it to secure the drill or reamer. If the work is heavy the drill may be further secured from turning with a lathe dog as shown in the photo.|$|E
50|$|The {{counterpoint}} to the headstock is <b>the</b> <b>tailstock,</b> {{sometimes referred to as}} the loose head, as it can be positioned at any convenient point on the bed by sliding it to the required area. The tail-stock contains a barrel, which does not rotate, but can slide in and out parallel to the axis of the bed and directly in line with the headstock spindle. The barrel is hollow and usually contains a taper to facilitate the gripping of various types of tooling. Its most common uses are to hold a hardened steel center, which is used to support long thin shafts while turning, or to hold drill bits for drilling axial holes in the work piece. Many other uses are possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{spinning}} process is fairly simple. A formed block is {{mounted in the}} drive section of a lathe. A pre-sized metal disk is then clamped against the block by a pressure pad, which is attached to <b>the</b> <b>tailstock.</b> The block and workpiece are then rotated together at high speeds. A localized force is then applied to the workpiece to cause it to flow over the block. The force is usually applied via various levered tools. Simple workpieces are just removed from the block, but more complex shapes may require a multi-piece block. Extremely complex shapes can be spun over ice forms, which then melt away after spinning. Because the final diameter of the workpiece is always less than the starting diameter, the workpiece must thicken, elongate radially, or buckle circumferentially.|$|E
50|$|The wood rotates {{between the}} {{headstock}} of the lathe {{which includes the}} drive mechanism and <b>the</b> <b>tailstock</b> support, which only rotates if its center is 'live' or supported by a rotating holding device. The headstock end may use points or spurs which are driven into the wood. This type of turning is described as 'between centers.' The headstock spindle may also use a cup, collet, or a scroll chuck to hold a tenon on the workpiece which will be removed in the finished product. The wood can also be screwed or glued to a faceplate—a strong disk that is threaded to mount on the headstock's spindle. The use of a chuck or faceplate allows the woodturner to forego tailstock support for the rotating wood. This type of secure holding system is essential for hollowing bowls or hollow forms.|$|E
5000|$|A soft {{dead center}} {{is used in}} the {{headstock}} spindle as the work rotates with the centre. Because the centre is soft it can be trued in place before use. The included angle is 60°. Traditionally, a hard dead center is used together with suitable lubricant in <b>the</b> <b>tailstock</b> to support the workpiece. In modern practice the dead center is frequently replaced by a live center, as it turns freely with the workpiece [...] - [...] usually on ball bearings [...] - [...] reducing the frictional heat, especially important at high speeds. When clear facing a long length of material it must be supported at both ends. This can be achieved by the use of a traveling or fixed steady. If a steady is not available, the end face being worked on may be supported by a dead (stationary) half center. A half center has a flat surface machined across a broad section of half of its diameter at the pointed end. A small section of the tip of the dead center is retained to ensure concentricity. Lubrication must be applied at this point of contact and tail stock pressure reduced. A lathe carrier or lathe dog may also be employed when turning between two centers.|$|E
5000|$|Tapered shank {{tools are}} removed from a socket using {{different}} approaches, depending {{on the design of}} the socket. In drill presses and similar tools, the tool is removed by inserting a wedge shaped block of metal called a [...] "drift" [...] into a rectangular shaped cross hole through the socket and tapping it. As the cross section of the drift gets larger when the drift is driven further in, {{the result is that the}} drift, bearing against the foremost edge of the tang, pushes the tool out. In many lathe tailstocks, the tool is removed by fully withdrawing the quill into <b>the</b> <b>tailstock,</b> which brings the tool up against the end of the leadscrew or an internal stud, separating the taper and releasing the tool. Where the tool is retained by a drawbar, as in some mill spindles, the drawbar is partially unthreaded with a wrench and then tapped with a hammer, which separates the taper, at which point the tool can be further unthreaded and removed. Some mill spindles have a captive drawbar which ejects the tool when actively unscrewed past the loose stage; these do not require tapping. For simple sockets with open access to the back end, a drift punch is inserted axially from behind and the tool tapped out.|$|E

40|$|The flukes are {{the primary}} {{locomotor}} structure in cetaceans, which produce hydrodynamic thrust as the caudal vertebrae are oscillated dorso-ventrally. Effective thrust generation {{is a function of}} the kinematics of the flukes, the angle of attack between the flukes and the incident water flow, and the shape of the flukes. We investigated the effect of bending within the caudal region of odontocete cetaceans to determine how changes in angular displacement between caudal vertebrae could effect passive shape change of the flukes. The internal and external changes of bent flukes were examined with computer tomography. Flukes and tailstock were removed from deceased Delphinus delphis, Lagenorhynchus acutus, Peponocephala electra, Phocoena phocoena and Tursiops truncatus, and bent on an adjustable support at 0, 45 and 90 ◦. At 0 ◦, cross-sections of the flukes displayed a symmetrical profile. Cross-sections of bent flukes (45 ◦, 90 ◦) were asymmetrical and showed a cambered profile. Maximum cambering occurred close to <b>the</b> <b>tailstock</b> and decreased toward the fluke tip. Maximum angular displacement occurred at the ‘ball vertebra’, which was located posterior of the anterior insertion of the flukes on <b>the</b> <b>tailstock.</b> Bending at the ‘ball vertebra ’ passively cambers the flexible flukes.
