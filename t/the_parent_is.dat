5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>is</b> present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E
5|$|Demand from {{middlemen}} {{and specialized}} animal trade mafias {{has increased the}} profitability of slow loris hunting and driven many hunters to catch any they spot by climbing or shaking trees. In the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia, slow lorises are shaken out of trees and then bludgeoned {{to death with a}} stick. In Indonesia, slow lorises are worth more alive, so hunters climb the tree to reach them and place a V-shaped stick around their neck to immobilize them. If the slow loris is found in with an infant, <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>is</b> often killed.|$|E
5|$|Securely {{attached}} {{children are}} {{best able to}} explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in {{how to cope with}} the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment {{can be seen as the}} most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>is</b> available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.|$|E
50|$|A {{child is}} a citizen upon birth if one or both <b>parents</b> <b>is</b> a Slovak citizen. Additionally a child born within the nation's {{territory}} to noncitizen parents may acquire citizenship if <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> stateless, if <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> unknown {{and there is no}} proof of foreign citizenship, or if the child does not choose to adopt the parents' nationality. When one <b>parent</b> <b>is</b> a citizen and the other is not, the child is considered a Slovak citizen even if <b>the</b> citizen <b>parent</b> <b>is</b> later determined not to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> child's actual <b>parent.</b>|$|R

To find out whether either of <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> carries <b>the</b> syndrome, both <b>parents</b> have to <b>be</b> tested. In several cases, the syndrome was identified with the child, because of an autism disorder or another problem, and later it appeared that <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>was</b> affected as well. <b>The</b> <b>parent</b> never knew about it up till the moment that the DNA-test proved <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> to <b>be</b> a carrier.|$|R

25|$|The Calkin–Wilf tree may {{be defined}} as a {{directed}} graph in which each positive rational number a/b occurs as a vertex and has one outgoing edge to another vertex, its parent. We assume that a/b is in simplest terms; that is, the greatest common divisor of a and b is 1. If a/b<1, the parent of a/b is a/(b'a); if a/b is greater than one, the parent of a/b is (a'b)/b. Thus, in either case, <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>is</b> a fraction with a smaller sum of numerator and denominator, so repeated reduction of this type must eventually reach the number 1. As a graph with one outgoing edge per vertex and one root reachable by all other vertices, the Calkin–Wilf tree must indeed be a tree.|$|E

2500|$|John Calvin {{describes}} the sacred {{origin of the}} role of human father (which thus demands honour). The analogy between the honour of parents and the honour of God himself is further strengthened by this understanding that earthly fatherhood is derived from God's Fatherhood. [...] Thus the duty to honour does not depend on whether <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>is</b> particularly worthy. However, Calvin acknowledges that some fathers are outright wicked and emphasizes there is no excuse for sin in the name of honouring a parent, calling the notion [...] "absurd".|$|E

2500|$|For example, one {{may make}} the {{following}} logical reasoning and support it using {{the basis of this}} rule: If, as a given, a parent will punish his or her child should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, surely the parent will punish his or her child should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, ripped pants and a torn shirt. The reasoning is based on pure logic: if <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>is</b> so upset about one item of clothing, surely he or she will be at least that upset about the child's entire ensemble. A somewhat easier construct would be to assert [...] "if a junior varsity basketball player can make a three-pointer, surely an excellent professional basketball player could make the same three-pointer," [...] but this might be attacked as a poor analogy because no one can make every shot.|$|E

When something is wrong with our car, our watch or our house, we call a professional to fix it. No one wants to repair these himself. In modern society, {{it is not enough to}} love the children. No seed will become a flower just because it gets love. It also needs professional care and nursing to bloom. So if we do not nurse and protect the child's talent, he will become a gloomy adult and the whole world will be poorer.
