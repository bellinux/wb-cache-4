Occasionally, Bennington did see action. On 10 September, she shelled a fort near Legaspi on the southeastern coast of Luzon. Two days later, she captured and destroyed the insurgent vessel Parao. Between 7 and 9 November, the warship supported an Army landing at San Fabian on the shores of Lingayen Gulf in northwestern Luzon.

5|$|In 1173, more <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>after</b> {{the murder}} of Becket, King Henry II of England decided to fill the vacant archbishopric of Canterbury; there were two candidates: Richard, and Odo, prior of Canterbury. Previously, Roger, the abbot of Bec Abbey, had been elected, but refused the office. On 3 June 1173, Richard was chosen, {{although}} the monks preferred Odo. Both sides appealed to Rome, and Richard journeyed to Rome with Reginald fitz Jocelin, who had recently been elected Bishop of Bath, to rebut the charges of simony, illegitimate birth, and swearing an oath to the king that had been raised. After hearing the charges, they were dismissed and the election was ratified on 2 April 1174 and on 7 April 1174 the new archbishop was consecrated at Anagni by Pope Alexander III. Richard returned to England {{at the close of}} the year bearing his pallium which he had received directly from the pope. He was also granted legatine powers by Alexander III.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Manning {{left the}} family in 1869 after selling most of the family's realty to his wife. There is no {{evidence}} that suggests that Isaac had any permanent relations with any members of the family again. Within four years James was remarried to her son Sylvester's father-in-law, Frank Perkins. The marriage lasted less <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> <b>after</b> which time she reverted to her former married name. It was at this time that James became increasingly worried about her eternal welfare. She began to petition the First Presidency to be endowed and to be sealed, along with her children, to Walker Lewis, a prominent African-American Mormon Elder. Lewis, like Elijah Abel, had been ordained to the priesthood during Joseph Smith's lifetime, and James therefore assumed that he would be eligible for temple ordinances. However, her petitions were consistently ignored or refused.|$|E
