5|$|Alien Soldier was {{released}} in 1995 on a physical cartridge format in Australia, Europe and Japan. In North America, the game was delivered exclusively through the Sega Channel cable service. Released late in the Mega Drive's lifecycle and {{after the release of}} the Sega Saturn, Alien Soldier pushed the system to its technical limits. Suganami wished he continued working on it after release, believing he could have improved on the story and graphics. Years later, Yosuke Okunari of Treasure addressed concerns that Alien Soldier {{was released}} as an incomplete game, stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> is only derived from Suganami having originally had large ambitions that were never realized.|$|E
5|$|Due to the 1989 {{amendments}} to the Constitution and the ISA, the exercise of the subjectively worded powers in the ISA is not judicially reviewable by the courts, except when {{there has been some}} non-compliance with the procedures set out in the Act. On the other hand, the objective test laid down in Chng Suan Tze continues to be the law governing judicial review of the exercise of executive discretion under subjectively worded provisions in statutes other than the ISA. In Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court of Appeal opined that the 1989 legislative amendments did not completely reverse Chng Suan Tze. Apart from restricting the courts' supervisory jurisdiction to reviewing decisions made under the ISA for procedural impropriety, Parliament did not disturb the principle laid down in Chng Suan Tze <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of a subjective or unfettered discretion– that is, power without legal limits– is contrary to the rule of law, which demands that courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power. Since Parliament did not undermine this principle when it legislatively reversed Chng Suan Tze, it should be taken to have implicitly endorsed the principle.|$|E

25|$|While Rorty shares Dewey’s {{commitment}} to debunk epistemological foundationalism, he (Rorty) believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of language is {{better suited to}} achieve this goal, than the notion of immediate, non-discursive experience preferred by Dewey.

25|$|It {{is tempting}} to think <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of {{function}} problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems. However, this is not really the case, since function problems can be recast as decision problems. For example, the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples (a,b,c) such that the relation a×b=c holds. Deciding whether a given triple {{is a member of}} this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers.|$|E
25|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to promote isospin from a global to a local symmetry.

25|$|The {{generally}} held {{view is that}} Malayalam was {{the western}} coastal dialect of Tamil and separated from Tamil sometime between the 9th and 13th centuries. Some scholars however believe that both Tamil and Malayalam developed during the prehistoric period from a common ancestor, 'Proto-Tamil-Dravidian', and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of Malayalam being a 'daughter' of Tamil is misplaced.

25|$|Many {{consequences}} of the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem seemed counterintuitive to logicians in the early 20th century, as the distinction between first-order and non-first-order properties was not yet understood. One such consequence is the existence of uncountable models of true arithmetic, which satisfy every first-order induction axiom but have non-inductive subsets. Another consequence that was considered particularly troubling is {{the existence of a}} countable model of set theory, which nevertheless must satisfy the sentence saying the real numbers are uncountable. This counterintuitive situation {{came to be known as}} Skolem's paradox; it shows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of countability is not absolute.|$|E

25|$|When Estonia regained its {{independence}} in 1991, Narva again became a border city. Local leaders, holdovers from the Soviet era, wanted autonomy, and contended <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of a breakaway 'Transnarovan SSR' republic in northeastern Estonia was becoming increasingly popular, {{but this was}} contradicted by polls showing 87% of the region's population opposed secession from Estonia. In 1993, dissatisfaction with newly enacted citizenship and election laws (non-citizens {{were not allowed to}} hold office) culminated in the Narva referendum of 16–17 July 1993, which proposed autonomy for Narva and Sillamäe, a nearby town. 97% voted in favor of the referendum, though turnout in Narva was 55% and there were credible charges of vote rigging. Russian residents nowadays are happy with their status as Estonian citizens and live peacefully alongside their compatriots.|$|E
25|$|Some {{critical}} scholars {{oppose the}} view that the sacred texts, including the Hebrew Bible, were divinely inspired. Many of these scholars accept the general principles of the documentary hypothesis and suggest that the Torah consists of inconsistent texts edited together in a way that calls attention to divergent accounts. Many suggest that during the First Temple period, the people of Israel believed that each nation had its own god, but that their god was superior to other gods. Some suggest that strict monotheism developed during the Babylonian Exile, perhaps in reaction to Zoroastrian dualism. In this view, it was only by the Hellenic period that most Jews came to believe that their god was the only god and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of a clearly bounded Jewish nation identical with the Jewish religion formed.|$|E
25|$|Southwest Airlines, {{founded in}} 1971 and {{headquartered}} at Love Field, built its business on selling quick, no-frills trips between Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. The company felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of {{a quick trip}} would be destroyed by a long drive to the new airport. Prior {{to the opening of}} DFW, Southwest Airlines sued for the right to remain at Love Field. In 1973 the courts ruled that the City of Dallas could not restrict Southwest Airlines from operating out of Love Field, so long as it remained open as an airport. This ruling effectively granted Southwest the right to continue to operate its existing intrastate service out of Love Field. The airlines operating from Love Field at the time DFW was conceived executed agreements with DFW stipulating that no airline could operate at the new airport if it continued to operate any flights out of Love Field. Southwest, created after the other carriers had signed on to the DFW operating agreements, was not a signatory and remained as the only airline operating at Love Field.|$|E

25|$|Some have {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of eternal return {{is related to}} the overman, since willing the eternal return of the same is a necessary step if the overman is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or asceticism. Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values. It could seem that the overman, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism. Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism. One must have the strength of the overman in order to will the eternal recurrence; that is, only the overman will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.|$|E
