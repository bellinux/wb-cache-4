5|$|The {{common toad}} emerges from {{hibernation}} {{in spring and}} there is a mass migration towards the breeding sites. The toads converge on certain ponds that they favour while avoiding other stretches of water that seem eminently suitable. Adults use the same location year after year and over 80% of males marked as juveniles have been found to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> at which they were spawned. They find their way to these mainly by using olfactory and magnetic cues. Toads experimentally moved elsewhere and fitted with tracking devices {{have been found to be}} able to locate their chosen breeding pond when the displacement exceeded three kilometres (two miles).|$|E
5|$|Another notable {{religious}} {{incident occurred}} in the central region under Cẩn's rule in 1963. A hugely oversized carp was found swimming in a small pond near the central city of Đà Nẵng. Local Buddhists began {{to believe that the}} fish was a reincarnation of one of Gautama Buddha's disciples. As pilgrimages <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> became larger and more frequent, so did disquiet among Cẩn's district chief and his subordinates. The local law enforcement agencies mined the pond, but the fish survived. They raked the pond with machine gun fire, but the fish again survived. To deal with the tenacious fish, they called in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces, led by Colonel Lê Quang Tung under the direction of Nhu. The grenading of the pond finally killed the carp. The killing had the unintended effect of increasing the public profile of the carp, with newspapers across the world running stories about the miraculous fish. Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) helicopters began landing at the site, with paratroopers filling their bottles with water that they believed to be magical.|$|E

Many readers attempted to locate Frenchman's Pond based on the descriptions from his books. Voelker did many things to discourage them from finding it, including leaving debris in the road <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pond,</b> although he did take some people with him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pond.</b> Frenchman's Pond is still owned by his daughter Grace and his grandson Adam.|$|E
25|$|Colliery pond {{was created}} when the National Coal Board {{constructed}} a concrete road to facilitate tipping. The road is concealed beneath {{the grass and}} acts as a dam.

25|$|Paintings and {{contemporary}} records in Scotland demonstrate that curling and ice skating were popular outdoor winter sports, with curling {{dating back to}} the 16th century and becoming widely popular in the mid-19th century.

25|$|On {{the hill}} to the east of Grenadier Pond, {{extending}} up to Colborne Lodge Road, is a landscaped ornamental garden area.

Along Colborne Lodge Road is a hanging garden and ornamental garden with fountains, the 'sunken gardens.' At the bottom of the hill, nearly at the shore line is a large maple leaf-shaped flower bed, visible from the top of the hill. The area was a tobogganing area in the early 1900s. Toboggan runs were constructed from the top of the hill extending down to the pond's ice surface. Wedding photography is no longer permitted in the hillside gardens area.|$|E

Weir also spent part of each summer between 2003 and 2005 working with Russian coach Tatiana Tarasova at the International Skating Center of Connecticut in Simsbury, Connecticut. In the summer of 2007 when he moved to the Ice Vault Arena in Wayne, New Jersey, Weir was coached instead by Galina Zmievskaya, who previously coached Weir's idol Oksana Baiul.

25|$|In late 2007, {{the city}} drained the Woodland Pond to {{construct}} a pavilion on its shore along with repairs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> itself using city funds and private donations.

On May 17, 2008, the Woodland Pond viewing pavilion was dedicated and the pond area re-opened along with a new water feature. Construction of the new items and renovations totaled approximately $225,000 in costs. Plans call for connecting the park via a nature park and trail along Rock Creek to northeast Hillsboro and other parks in the city, eventually crossing north of the Sunset Highway. The park closed for a day in July 2014 due to reports of a cougar.|$|E

There are some forty species of rare flowering plants, and fourteen species of British orchids have been recorded on the common due to its special soil conditions. With such a variety of flowers the site is attractive to butterflies. Twenty-six species have been regularly recorded, including green hairstreak, brown argus and Essex skipper. Kingfisher and heron are also visitors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pond,</b> and no fewer than 19 species of dragonfly/damselfly have been observed. The bird life of the common includes varieties such as chiffchaff, willow warbler, blackcap, common whitethroat, lesser whitethroat, reed warbler and occasionally sedge and grasshopper warblers. Nightjars are occasionally heard. Foxes and muntjac deer along with smaller mammals such as water shrew, field voles, and harvest mice are present. Adders, slowworms and common lizards can also be found on the common.|$|E

500|$|Spencer Gore's {{painting}} Richmond Park, {{thought to}} have been painted in the autumn of 1913 or shortly before the artist's death in March 1914, was exhibited at the Paterson and Carfax Gallery in 1920. In 1939 it was exhibited in Warsaw, Helsingfors and Stockholm by the British Council as Group of Trees. It is now {{in the collection of the}} Tate Gallery under its original title but is not currently on display. [...] The painting is one of a series of landscapes painted in Richmond Park during the last months of Gore's life. According to Tate curator Helena Bonett, Gore's early death from pneumonia, two months before what would have been his 36th birthday, was brought on by his painting outdoors in Richmond Park in the cold and wet winter months. It is not certain where in the park the picture was made but a row of trees close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pond</b> near Cambrian Gate has a very close resemblance to those in the painting. Another Gore painting, with the same title (Richmond Park), painted in 1914, is at the Ashmolean Museum. His painting Wood in Richmond Park is in the Birmingham Art Gallery's collection.|$|E
