The microbiological analysis of the commercial <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oils flavoured with lemon, oregano, garlic and red chilli pepper indicated the presence of a dif-ferent type of microflora according to the ingredient. Moulds were present in all of the types of commercial flavoured olive oils, yeasts were only found in the oil enriched with oregano, while bacteria were only occasionally observed. The trials performed in labora-tory using experimental <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil, flavoured with the same ingredients, at zero concentration (control), 1, 5 and 10 % (w/v), confirmed the survival of the microorganisms in the flavoured olive oil in a different way according to the type and concentration of the ingredients. In fact, after 40 days of storage, yeasts were present in the olive oil flavoured with 1 % of oregano; moulds were widespread in all of the samples of oil flavoured with lemon, oregano and red chilli pepper, while bacteria were only observed in the oil enriched with 5 and 10 % of red chilli pepper.

However, the concentration of pigments can vary significantly depending on the climate conditions, harvesting time, and olive cultivars. In this work, we quantified the main pigments in several <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oils produced from a blend of three cultivars (Moraiolo, Frantoio, and Leccino) typical of Tuscany (Italy) harvested in three different years: 2012, 2013, and 2014.

Data were analyzed by a multivariate statistical approach. The results show that the pigments’ content of <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oils produced in 2014 can be well distinguished with respect to previous years. This can be explained by the anomalous climate conditions, which strongly affected Italy and, in particular, Tuscany, where the olives were harvested.

The results confirmed that physicochemical parameters varied with the storage lighting conditions and more significantly with time. Also, multiple linear regression models, using sub-sets of 2228 sensors selected with a meta-heuristic simulated annealing algorithm, allow evaluating the storage time-evolution of olive oils peroxide values, extinction coefficients and oxidative stabilities with satisfactory accuracy (R 2 0. 98 and 0. 96, for leave-one-out and repeated K-fold cross-validation procedures, respectively).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Observational {{cohort studies}} and a {{secondary}} prevention trial have shown an inverse association between {{adherence to the}} Mediterranean diet and cardiovascular risk. We conducted a randomized trial of this diet pattern for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events. METHODS: In a multicenter trial in Spain, we randomly assigned participants who were at high cardiovascular risk, but with no cardiovascular disease at enrollment, {{to one of three}} diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts, or a control diet (advice to reduce dietary fat). Participants received quarterly individual and group educational sessions and, depending on group assignment, free provision of <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil, mixed nuts, or small nonfood gifts. The primary end point was the rate of major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes). On the basis of the results of an interim analysis, the trial was stopped after a median follow-up of 4. 8 years. RESULTS: A total of 7447 persons were enrolled (age range, 55 to 80 years); 57 % were women. The two Mediterranean-diet groups had good adherence to the intervention, according to self-reported intake and biomarker analyses. A primary end-point event occurred in 288 participants. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios were 0. 70 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 54 to 0. 92) and 0. 72 (95 % CI, 0. 54 to 0. 96) for the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil (96 events) and the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with nuts (83 events), respectively, versus the control group (109 events).

40|$|Pigments, {{divided into}} {{carotenoids}} and chlorophyll derivatives, {{are responsible for}} the colour of <b>extra‐virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil (EVOO). The concentration of pigments in EVOO depends on several factors, such as the maturity of olives before oil production, the cultivar and the geographic origin of olives. Pigments naturally degrade in olive oil (OO) during storage, and they may decompose due to light, temperature and oxygen exposure. The nature and concentration of pigments in EVOOs are different from seed oils, and this is a base of their use to reveal oil treatments and sophistication. In this chapter, the analytical methods, mainly chromatographic and spectroscopic, applied to identify and quantify pigments are overviewed. In particular, the applications of these methods to check the authenticity and the quality of <b>extra‐virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil are discussed...|$|R
40|$|IMPORTANCE: Breast {{cancer is}} the leading cause of female cancer burden, and its {{incidence}} has increased by more than 20 % worldwide since 2008. Some observational studies have suggested that the Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of 2 interventions with Mediterranean diet vs the advice to follow a low-fat diet (control) on breast cancer incidence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The PREDIMED study is a 1 : 1 : 1 randomized, single-blind, controlled field trial conducted at primary health care centers in Spain. From 2003 to 2009, 4282 women aged 60 to 80 years and at high cardiovascular disease risk were recruited after invitation by their primary care physicians. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly allocated to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts, or a control diet (advice to reduce dietary fat). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Breast cancer incidence was a prespecified secondary outcome of the trial for women without a prior history of breast cancer (n = 4152). RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 4. 8 years, we identified 35 confirmed incident cases of breast cancer. Observed rates (per 1000 person-years) were 1. 1 for the Mediterranean diet with <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil group, 1. 8 for the Mediterranean diet with nuts group, and 2. 9 for the control group. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios vs the control group were 0. 32 (95 % CI, 0. 13 - 0. 79) for the Mediterranean diet with <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil group and 0. 59 (95 % CI, 0. 26 - 1. 35) for the Mediterranean diet with nuts group. In analyses with yearly cumulative updated dietary exposures, the hazard ratio for each additional 5 % of calories from <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil was 0. 72 (95 % CI, 0. 57 - 0. 90). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This is the first randomized trial finding an effect of a long-term dietary intervention on breast cancer incidence. Our results suggest a beneficial effect of a Mediterranean diet supplemented with <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil in the primary prevention of breast cancer. These results come from a secondary analysis of a previous trial and are based on few incident cases and, therefore, need to be confirmed in longer-term and larger studies...|$|R
