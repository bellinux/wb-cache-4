5|$|One {{can solve}} these problems, {{according}} to Fodor, with functionalism, a hypothesis {{which was designed}} to overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism. What is important is the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for this view lies in the principle of the multiple realizability of the mental. Under this view, for example, I and a computer can both instantiate ("realize") the same functional state <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> made of completely different material stuff (see graphic at right). On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of token materialism.|$|E
25|$|In one Native North American story, an evil serpent kills {{one of the}} gods' cousins, so the god {{kills the}} serpent in revenge, but the dying serpent unleashes a great flood. People first flee to the {{mountains}} and then, when the mountains are covered, they float on a raft until the flood subsides. The evil spirits that the serpent god controlled then hide out of fear. The Mound Builders associated great mystical value to the serpent, as the Serpent Mound demonstrates, <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> unable to unravel the particular associations.|$|E
25|$|A very {{different}} reason for Kol Nidre was {{suggested by the}} Zohar; God has already threatened and vowed terrible punishments upon the Jewish people for their sins, but by our own demonstration that we can unbind ourselves from vows using Kol Nidre we hope to persuade God to similarly annul His own vows of calamity. As stated in the Orot Sephardic mahzor: According to the holy Zohar, Kol Nidre is recited on Yom Kippur because, at times, the Heavenly judgment is handed down as an 'avowed decree' for which there can normally be no annulment. By reciting the Kol Nidre annulment of vows at this time, we are asking of God that He favor us by annuling any negative decrees of judgment that await us, even <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> undeserving of such annulment.|$|E

25|$|The Notre Dame review {{also noted}} that {{benefits}} from the restrictions weren’t enough to address the deep-rooted issues associated with alcohol abuse, and communities in the Valley needed continuing support. In her speech at the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Commission Forum, Perth, 10 August 2009, Oscar stated that Aboriginal leaders in the Valley had taken their first steps {{on the path of}} reconstructing their communities but now needed the government to support them:It is a story of colonisation; the threat of losing our cultural authority to manage our societies; and the despair that has come from that disempowerment.It is a story of grief and trauma and the continued pain of living with grog, drug and violence.It is a story that academics and journalists write about us as <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> victims of history that we can do nothing about. And within their stories about us is an acceptance that the paternal hand of government will determine the nature of our welfare and even the nature of our rights.… I want to tell a different story. It is about how Aboriginal people can be the authors of our stories and not passive and powerless subjects in stories told and written by others.… I want to talk about how the leaders of the Fitzroy Valley in the Kimberley are working together to create a pathway of hope and community vitality and resilience… if our journey of social reconstruction could be measured as a one kilometre track, we have only travelled the first metre.The start of the journey has depended on the leadership of the Aboriginal community but the journey from this point on will largely be shaped by a partnership that we can create and build with governments.|$|E

2500|$|St Thomas Aquinas interprets 'You should {{love your}} {{neighbour}} as yourself' as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar {{of love for}} others. Considering that [...] "the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship" [...] and quotes Aristotle that [...] "the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves," [...] he concluded that <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common good, {{the good of the}} whole, more than any private good, the good of a part. However, he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being. In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, Comte was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism.|$|E

2500|$|Paranoia of a Russian {{invasion}} subsided in 1888, when Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich {{arrived in}} the Colony on board the corvette Rynda as part of celebrations of the Colonial centenary. The Rynda pulled into Newcastle in the afternoon of 19 January 1888 to replenish coal supplies, becoming the first Russian naval visitor to the city. The Newcastle Morning Herald and Miners' Advocate reported on 20 January 1888 that given the uncertain state of diplomatic relations between the European powers many people fled fearing that the Russian warship was present in Newcastle to start a war; however, those fears were quickly allayed when the goodwill nature of the visit became known. From Newcastle, the Rynda sailed to Sydney. The day after arrival Lord Carrington, the Governor of New South Wales, sent a coach to bring the Grand Duke to Government House. He was unable to attend due to laws of the Russian Empire which prohibited participation in State ceremonies of foreign states. The Russian officers attended Government House on 24 January as the guest of Lady Carrington. The [...] was late arriving in Sydney and on 26 January, the day of celebrations, the Rynda orchestra was invited to entertain the public, and the Australian media made the Grand Duke the central focus of the events. On 30 January the Russian officers were present at the ceremony of {{the foundation of the}} new parliament building. One hundred seamen from the Rynda were invited to a festival organised by the citizens of Sydney on 31 January, and the Russian and French flags were given prominence next to the Australian flag, whilst those of other nations were along the walls. Denoting the goodwill nature of the visit, Lord Carrington in a speech said, [...] "We welcome into the waters of Port Jackson the gallant ship Rynda, we welcome the gallant sailors who sail under the blue cross of Saint Andrew, and we especially welcome— <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not permitted to do so in official manner– that distinguished officer who is on board, a close blood-relation of his Majesty the Tsar. Though not permitted to offer him an official welcome, we offer him a right royal welcome with all our hearts." [...] The Rynda left Sydney on 9 February and arrived in Melbourne on 12 February. The visit was initially reported positively in the press, but after a few days The Age began to campaign for restricting the entry of foreign naval ships into Melbourne, and other articles described the expected war between [...] "semi-barbarous and despotic Russia" [...] and England. The public, however, continued to view the presence of the Russians positively, and on 22 February the Mayor of Melbourne Benjamin Benjamin visited the ships. After staying for nearly a month, the Rynda left Melbourne on 6 March for New Zealand. The Grand Duke supported expanding trade ties with Australia, noting that it was desirable for the Russians to expand their ties with Australia, outside of their relationship with Britain, and stated his belief that such relations were long overdue.|$|E
