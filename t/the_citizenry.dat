5|$|Australia became {{directly}} involved when the Confederate navy visited {{in order to}} repair one of their warships. This led to protests from the Union representative at Melbourne, while <b>the</b> <b>citizenry</b> of nearby Williamstown entertained the Confederates and some Australians joined the crew. Accounts disagree as to whether Australians generally favored the Union or the Confederacy, as sorrowful demonstrations were held in Sydney when news arrived of Abraham Lincoln's assassination.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this did}} not apply to the Subura slums, which were still as rickety and fire-prone as ever, he did leave a mark on the monumental {{topography}} of the centre and of the Campus Martius, with the Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace) and monumental sundial, whose central gnomon was an obelisk taken from Egypt. The relief sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustus' triumphs in the Res Gestae. Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the praetorians, the Vestals, and <b>the</b> <b>citizenry</b> of Rome.|$|E

5|$|From here Alcibiades {{joined in}} the siege of Byzantium along with Theramenes and Thrasyllus. A portion of the {{citizens}} of the city, demoralized and hungry, decided to surrender the city to Alcibiades for similar terms as the Selymbrians had received. On the designated night the defenders left their posts, and the Athenians attacked the Peloponnesian garrison in the city and their boats in the harbor. The portion of <b>the</b> <b>citizenry</b> that remained loyal to the Peloponnesians fought so savagely that Alcibiades issued a statement {{in the midst of the}} fighting which guaranteed their safety and this persuaded the remaining citizens to turn against the Peloponnesian garrison, which was nearly totally destroyed.|$|E
5|$|His {{popularity}} among <b>the</b> <b>citizenry</b> had never waned, and support {{continued to be}} evident, even {{on the eve of}} his overthrow and throughout his exile. He was seen as a hero, a model citizen, a caring monarch, and the source of national unity and well-being. Following his death, political wrangling prevented the return of his remains to Brazil. Continued efforts to repatriate the bodies of the Emperor and his wife dragged on for decades. The disputes were resolved and this was finally accomplished in 1920 with much fanfare. Over the decades, PedroII gradually grew within Brazil to represent the archetypical benevolent, self-effacing and effective ruler concerned only for the national welfare.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution did allow {{followers}} of other, non-Catholic, faiths {{to practice their}} religious beliefs, albeit only in private. The construction of non-Catholic religious buildings was forbidden. From the outset these restrictions were ignored by both <b>the</b> <b>citizenry</b> and authorities. In Belém, Pará's capital, the first synagogue was built in 1824. Jews migrated to Brazil soon after its independence and settled mainly in the northeastern provinces of Bahia and Pernambuco and in the northern provinces of Amazonas and Pará. Other Jewish groups came from the Alsace-Lorraine region of Germany and from Russia. By the 1880s, there were several Jewish communities and synagogues scattered throughout Brazil.|$|E

50|$|Little {{is known}} about Rufus's life. According to the Suda, {{he lived in the}} time of Trajan (98-117), which is {{probably}} correct, as Rufus quotes Zeuxis and Dioscorides, and is himself quoted by Galen. He probably studied at Alexandria, for he makes personal comments about <b>the</b> <b>citizenry's</b> general health and specific diseases. He then established himself at Ephesus, which was a center of the medical profession.|$|R

5|$|The Weiquan {{movement}} is a non-centralized group of lawyers, legal experts, and intellectuals in China {{who seek to}} protect and defend {{the civil rights of}} <b>the</b> <b>citizenry</b> through litigation and legal activism. The movement, which began in the early 2000s, has organized demonstrations, sought reform via the legal system and media, defended victims of human rights abuses, and written appeal letters, despite opposition from Communist Party authorities. Among the issues adopted by Weiquan lawyers are property and housing rights, protection for AIDS victims, environmental damage, religious freedom, freedom of speech and the press, and defending the rights of other lawyers facing disbarment or imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{religious}} overtones similar to Swift's sermons, {{such as the}} Drapier's combination of a duty to God with duty to one's king and country. Many critics compare the language and rhetorical style of the first letter to a Hebrew prophet or to an evangelical preacher who warns the masses of an imminent threat to their soul. However, the final judgment had not yet come, so the Drapier also included arguments claiming that Wood's halfpence would destroy the Irish economy and the souls of <b>the</b> <b>citizenry.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the war {{turned against}} the Austrians, the {{garrison}} in Bologna left {{early in the morning}} on 12 June 1859. By the end of the same day the papal colours flying in the squares had been replaced with the Italian green, white and red, the cardinal legate had left the city, and a group styling itself Bologna's provisional government had proclaimed its desire to join the Kingdom of Sardinia. Bologna was promptly incorporated as part of the province of Romagna. The Archbishop Michele Viale-Prelà attempted to persuade <b>the</b> <b>citizenry</b> not to co-operate with the new civil authorities, but had little success. One of the new order's first official acts was to introduce freedom of religion and make all citizens equal before the law. In November 1859 the governor Luigi Carlo Farini issued a proclamation abolishing the inquisition.|$|E
50|$|The monastery church was, {{after the}} {{imperial}} Collegiate Church of Saint Bartholomew the largest {{church in the}} city. It attracted several prominent scholars and preachers and received numerous donations from <b>the</b> local <b>citizenry.</b> <b>The</b> elections of the German kings Adolf of Nassau (1292), Henry VII (1308) and Günther von Schwarzburg (1349) {{took place at the}} monastery.|$|R
50|$|After Clinton’s inaugural address, Maya Angelou recited {{her poem}} “On the Pulse of Morning”. The poem, which Angelou wrote {{specifically}} for the inauguration, shared common themes to Clinton’s inaugural address, including change, responsibility, and the President's and <b>the</b> <b>citizenry's</b> role in establishing economic security. Angelou became the second poet in history to read a poem at a presidential inauguration, as Robert Frost was the first, who recited a poem at John F Kennedy’s inauguration in 1961.|$|R

5|$|Some {{of the key}} {{principles}} {{associated with}} the thin conception {{of the rule of}} law include judicial independence, natural justice, the availability of judicial review, and the accessibility of justice. Judicial independence in Singapore is safeguarded by various constitutional provisions and legal rules, though some commentators have highlighted certain events as suggesting a lack of judicial independence. One incident in the 1980s involving the transfer of the Senior District Judge to the Attorney-General's Chambers following a decision he made which was favourable to an opposition politician was investigated by a commission of inquiry and found not to be due to executive interference. In Singapore, natural justice is generally regarded as a procedural rather than a substantive concept. The process of judicial review involves the review of executive actions for compliance with administrative law rules, and of executive and legislative acts for unconstitutionality in light of the doctrine of constitutional supremacy. The state of the courts and legal processes in Singapore are largely seen as making justice accessible for <b>the</b> <b>citizenry.</b>|$|E

50|$|Following {{a series}} of wars the Roman Republic engaged since {{the closing of the}} Second Punic War (218-201 B.C.), such as the Jugurthine War and {{conflicts}} in Macedonia and Asia, the significant {{reduction in the number of}} Roman family farmers had resulted in the shortage of people whose property qualified them to perform <b>the</b> <b>citizenry's</b> military duty to Rome. As a result of the Marian reforms initiated in 107 B.C. by the Roman general Gaius Marius (157-86), the proletarii became the backbone of the Roman Army.|$|R

The data is collected by using a deformed shape of Michalopoulous et al. (1998) Questionnaire in consideration form. The results show that the viewpoints about municipality activities, executing the plans, instruction quality and accessibility to recreational areas are above average and the viewpoints about the municipality services are lower than average. The satisfaction with physical education authorities and <b>citizenries</b> about <b>the</b> municipality activities is about average, but the satisfaction with municipality authorities is above average. It indicates that the municipality managers and authorities are satisfied with their own actions. The satisfaction of municipality activities was not adequate in different fields. Municipality should use trainers with sufficient skills for higher satisfaction, improve the quality of relevant equipment, and should develop and expand sportive areas and places. Also, it should inform <b>the</b> <b>citizenries</b> about <b>the</b> activities through adequate propaganda in order to provide higher motivation for participation of people in recreational activities in their leisure time...|$|R

25|$|Under Washington and Adams the Federalists had {{established}} a strong government, but sometimes it followed policies that alienated <b>the</b> <b>citizenry.</b> For example, in 1798, {{to pay for the}} rapidly expanding army and navy, the Federalists had enacted a new tax on houses, land and slaves, affecting every property owner in the country. In the Fries's Rebellion hundreds of farmers in Pennsylvania revolted—Federalists saw a breakdown in civil society. Some tax resisters were arrested—then pardoned by Adams. Republicans denounced this action as an example of Federalist tyranny.|$|E
25|$|The tone of {{the piece}} {{is to ensure that}} <b>the</b> <b>citizenry</b> would not backslide into their old monarchical ways.

In particular, Milton argued {{that it would be a}} sin against God to bring back the monarchy and warned against the lack of freedom and virtue that would correspond with a king.

5000|$|The {{last few}} decades of local history were {{characterized}} by development that saw the population figure rise from roughly 1,000 to more than 3,700. For this, great efforts were required of the mayors Hans Steib (1960-1979), Richard Becker (1979-2003) and Dr. Werner Dahmen (2003- [...] ) and the councillors and administrations at their side. Praiseworthy, too, were the understanding on <b>the</b> <b>citizenry’s</b> part and <b>the</b> readiness on the designated authorities’ part to support the municipality in many projects. The following overview makes clear how Zornheim came to develop into what it is today.|$|R
