2500|$|Trigger (with new skipper Commander David R. Connole) {{stood out}} to sea on 11 March to begin her 12th war patrol {{and headed for the}} Nansei Shoto area. On 18 March, she {{attacked}} a convoy west of the islands, sinking the cargo ship Tsukushi Maru No.3 and damaging another. She reported the attack on 20 March, and the submarine was subsequently ordered to radio as many movements of the convoy as possible to help find a safe passage through a known mined area of the East China Sea. On 24 March, Trigger was ordered to begin patrolling west of the islands the next day, outside the 100fathom curve, and to steer clear of restricted areas. On 26 March, she was ordered to join a wolf pack called [...] "Earl's Eliminators" [...] and <b>to</b> <b>acknowledge</b> <b>receipt</b> of the message. A weather report came from the submarine that day but no confirmation of her having received the message. The weather report was Triggers last transmission. On 4 April, she was ordered to proceed to Midway, but she had not arrived by 1 May and was reported as presumed lost.|$|E
2500|$|I {{have also}} <b>to</b> <b>acknowledge</b> <b>receipt</b> {{of a letter}} from Mr. H.E. Holmes of Durban, {{enclosing}} the text of a pronouncement made by the South African Board of Control to the effect that, {{in the opinion of}} that body, the contest between the MCC team and The Reef at Vogelfontein on 22 and 23 December 1909, was not a first-class match. In the course of this encounter Hobbs scored 70 runs which are counted in his first-class aggregate. Seeing that the game was regarded, {{at the time it was}} played, as first-class and until a little while ago had been left in undisputed possession of that rank, the need for raising any question about the matter after more than twenty years is not at all obvious. In any circumstances, I should not advise the dragging up of what, with all due respect to the recent ruling of the South African Board, must remain a debatable matter. The Reef team included some Test match players and others who had appeared in Inter-State games so it certainly had considerable claims to be regarded as first-class and from that standing, I cannot, all things considered, agree after such a long lapse of time to reduce it. Outside the merits of the case, is there not something rather grotesque in the idea of a controlling body sitting in solemn conclave over so small a matter and deciding to upset what had been accepted for twenty years? ...|$|E

6000|$|MY DEAR BURLINGAME, - In {{the first}} place, I have <b>to</b> <b>acknowledge</b> <b>receipt</b> of your munificent cheque for {{three hundred and}} fifty dollars. Glad you liked the Scott voyage; rather more than I did upon the whole. As the proofs have not turned up at all, {{there can be no}} {{question}} of returning them, and I am therefore very much pleased to think you have arranged not to wait. The volumes of Adams arrived along with yours of October 6th. One of the dictionaries has also blundered home, apparently from the Colonies; the other is still to seek. I note and sympathise with your bewilderment as to FALESA. My own direct correspondence with Mr. Baxter is now about three months in abeyance. Altogether you see how well it would be if you could do anything to wake up the Post Office. Not a single copy of the 'Footnote' has yet reached Samoa, but I hear of one having come to its address in Hawaii. Glad to hear good news of Stoddard. - Yours sincerely, ...|$|E

50|$|Note that Alice cannot encode her {{telephone}} number {{in just one}} err-mail, because it contains six characters, and that the maximum length of one err-mail message is five characters.
