25|$|Respecting one's {{health and}} {{physical}} well-being {{was one of the}} foundations of the group. If any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure. A movement executed only once was not considered an achievement; only with repetition was the challenge complete. Every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury. If any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> again.|$|E
25|$|Several {{cars were}} {{conceived}} by Henry Ford from {{the founding of}} the company in 1903 before the Model T was introduced. Although he started with the Model A, there were not 19 production models (A through T); some were only prototypes. The production model immediately before the Model T was the Model S, an upgraded version of the company's largest success to that point, the Model N. The follow-up was the Ford Model A (rather than any Model U). The company publicity said this was because the new car was such a departure from the old that Henry wanted <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> again with the letter A.|$|E
25|$|The Civil War hit {{the county}} {{education}} establishment hard. Several {{years in the}} 1860s saw no schools operating {{at all in the}} county and the county basically had <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> in building up the system after the war. The system went from 71 districts in which 61 districts taught school for a whole three months in 1860, to only four schools total for White students in 1870. Many of the former school buildings were in serious states of disrepair. But the end of Reconstruction brought renewed interest {{and by the end of}} the 1870s, 106 White schools and 6 Black schools existed. In 1885, the superintendent became an elected position, the first being Quincy F. Neal.|$|E

25|$|Ruskin {{was born}} at 54 Hunter Street, Brunswick Square, London (demolished 1969), south of St Pancras railway station. His {{childhood}} was characterised by the contrasting influences {{of his father and}} mother, both fiercely ambitious for him. John James Ruskin helped to develop his son's Romanticism. They shared a passion for the works of Byron, Shakespeare and especially Walter Scott. They visited Scott's home, Abbotsford in 1838, but Ruskin was disappointed by its appearance. Margaret Ruskin, an Evangelical Christian, more cautious and restrained than her husband, taught young John to read the King James Bible from beginning to end, and then <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> again, committing large portions to memory. Its language, imagery and stories had a profound and lasting effect on his writing.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, L.A.P.D. {{recorded}} {{their second}} album, Who's Laughing Now. Released on May 3, 1991, {{it was their}} first full-length studio album, and consisted of eleven tracks. After they recorded the album, the group's lead vocalist, Pete Capra, left L.A.P.D. {{and was replaced by}} someone affectionately known by other band members as Corey. Bassist Arvizu wrote: [...] "Pete [...] was always doing amphetamines and stuff. He pretty much left just because of his drug abuse. So Munky , David , and I had <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> again." [...] The band later fired Corey after his behavior during an audition with producer Ross Robinson. While looking for a new singer, they heard Jonathan Davis singing for the alternative metal band Sexart. After the show, the remaining band members of L.A.P.D. asked him to join their band. Shortly after this, the band changed their name to Korn and added Brian Welch to the member line-up.|$|E
500|$|Berry {{was famous}} for his {{attention}} to detail and preparation, which he used to overcome his physical limitations. Considered slow for a wide receiver, he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.8 seconds. Rather than speed, he was renowned for his precise pass patterns and sure hands; he rarely dropped passes, and he fumbled only once in his career. He would squeeze Silly Putty constantly to strengthen his hands. He and Unitas regularly worked after practice and developed the timing and knowledge of each other's abilities that made each more effective. The reason for this, according to Berry, was that the two did not think on the same wavelength. [...] "Every season we had <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> on our timing, especially the long ball," [...] said Berry. [...] "He {{knew he had to}} release the ball when I was eighteen yards from scrimmage for me to receive it thirty-eight yards out. I knew I had to make my break in those first eighteen yards and get free within 2.8 seconds." [...] He also relied on shifty moves, and by his count, he had 88 different moves to get open, all of which he practiced every week.|$|E

500|$|Telegraph Avenue, {{adapted from}} {{an idea for}} a TV series pilot that Chabon was asked to write in 1999, is a social novel set on the borders between Oakland and Berkeley in the summer of 2004 that sees a [...] "large cast of {{characters}} grapple with infidelity, fatherhood, crooked politicians, racism, nostalgia and buried secrets." [...] Chabon said upon publication {{in an interview with the}} San Francisco Chronicle that the novel concerns [...] "the possibility and impossibility of creating shared community spaces that attempt to transcend the limits imposed on us by our backgrounds, heritage and history." [...] Five years in gestation, Telegraph Avenue had a difficult birth, Chabon telling the Guardian newspaper, [...] "I got two years into the novel and got completely stymied and felt like it was an utter flop.... I had <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> again, keeping the characters but reinventing the story completely and leaving behind almost every element." [...] After starting out with literary realism with his first two novels and moving into genre-fiction experiments from The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay onward, Chabon feels that Telegraph Avenue is a significant [...] "unification" [...] of his earlier and later styles, declaring in an interview, [...] "I could do whatever I wanted to do in this book and it would be OK even if it verged on crime fiction, even if it verged on magic realism, even if it verged on martial arts fiction.... I was open to all of that and yet I didn't have to repudiate or steer away from the naturalistic story about two families living their everyday lives and coping with pregnancy and birth and adultery and business failure and all the issues that might go into making a novel written in the genre of mainstream quote-unquote realistic fiction, that that was another genre for me now and I felt free to mix them all in a sense." [...] The novel has been optioned by film producer Scott Rudin (who previously optioned and produced Wonder Boys), and Cameron Crowe is adapting the novel into a screenplay, according to Chabon.|$|E

Desperate for Yi-ru to accept his love for her he uses their business relationship and signs up for cooking class with her father just to be able to have a chance to see her.

2500|$|Hansen {{later said}} {{this was the moment}} where he [...] "had" [...] him. Since all Hansen had to go on was the word of David Stanley and his mother, he could not have known for sure if there really had been money in the envelope. In fact, Hansen never {{actually}} mentioned money when he produced the envelopes, only asking {{whether or not there was}} any correspondence between the AD's office and the Stanley family. By refusing to acknowledge that he had, in fact, sent something to Stanley's family and then backtracking when confronted with evidence that contradicted his statement, Hansen knew Parker was hiding something. Hansen also admitted that Parker could've just lied about the contents of the envelopes and his investigation would've been stopped cold. As Hansen said years after the incident, [...] "That was the defining moment. All (Parker) had to say was, 'I'm glad you asked, I sent him an insurance form,' and we would've had <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over,</b> because every dot that we connected started from the premise that we know he sent something." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Perry and McKee {{first met}} in 2004, {{they both were}} [...] "really into Lolita" [...] and [...] "had a mutual fascination with the {{adolescent}} state of mind." [...] They explored the themes in their first records: Perry wrote One of the Boys, which touched on {{the early stages of}} discovering that boys could be more than friends, whereas McKee wrote [...] "Confessions of a Teenage Girl", which was about using sexual power to one's advantage. For the Teenage Dream sessions, Perry and McKee had a [...] "forever young" [...] idea in mind. Perry at first wrote a lyric about Peter Pan, but they later deemed it as [...] "too young" [...] since [...] "we wanted it to have more edge, more sex." [...] Another version included the lines [...] "And {{the next thing you know}} / You're a mom in a minivan", which made them laugh uncontrollably for an hour. There was a final version that was based around the metaphor of [...] "" [...] comparing clothes to sex, in a similar manner to Madonna's 1985 single [...] "Dress You Up". It was rejected by the producers, as McKee explained, [...] "Luke always makes us 'Benny Proof' everything. He says that if Benny doesn't get it, America won't get it." [...] Blanco showed them The Teenagers's 2007 single [...] "Homecoming" [...] and asked them to write in a similar style. McKee said that [...] " [...] looked at each other with dread, knowing we had <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> again..... We were both so over it we just called it a night." ...|$|E
