5|$|The many {{different}} forms of periodic table have prompted {{the question of whether}} there is an optimal or definitive form of periodic table. The answer to <b>this</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> thought to depend on whether the chemical periodicity seen to occur among the elements has an underlying truth, effectively hard-wired into the universe, or if any such periodicity is instead the product of subjective human interpretation, contingent upon the circumstances, beliefs and predilections of human observers. An objective basis for chemical periodicity would settle the questions about the location of hydrogen and helium, and the composition of group 3. Such an underlying truth, if it exists, is thought to have not yet been discovered. In its absence, the {{many different}} forms of periodic table can be regarded as variations on the theme of chemical periodicity, each of which explores and emphasizes different aspects, properties, perspectives and relationships of and among the elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} theories for forces {{developed from}} the unification of disparate ideas. For example, Isaac Newton unified, with his universal theory of gravitation, the force responsible for objects falling near {{the surface of the}} Earth with the force responsible for the falling of celestial bodies about the Earth (the Moon) and the Sun (the planets). Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through a theory of electromagnetism. In the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons. This standard model of particle physics assumes a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory, which was subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations suggest that the standard model is incomplete. A Grand Unified Theory that allows for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics. Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything. Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor, but currently the most popular approach to answering <b>this</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> string theory.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> {{of special}} {{interest}} to philosophers of physics, as physicists continue to show {{a strong interest in}} the subject.

25|$|This {{publication}} set out {{the modern}} model-theoretic definition of (semantic) logical consequence, {{or at least the}} basis for it.

John Etchemendy stimulated much of the recent discussion about Tarski's treatment of varying domains.|$|E
25|$|This {{linguistic}} dispute became politically {{relevant for}} the Italian irredentist movement. Italian nationalists interpreted Battisti's hypothesis as implying that Romansh, Friulan and Ladin were not separate languages but rather Italian dialects.

25|$|At low momenta (infrared limit) the {{question}} has been more involved to settle.

An answer to <b>this</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> a fundamental one as it would provide an understanding to the problem of confinement. On the other side, it should not be forgotten that propagators are gauge-dependent quantities and so, they must be managed carefully when one wants to get meaningful physical results.|$|E
25|$|Abhinavagupta {{remained}} unmarried all his life, we do however {{know him}} to be an adept of Kaula and as such, used his energy (ojas, or internally sublimated semen) as a vital force, {{a constant source of}} shakti to power the spiritual nervous system he outlined in his works. This system involves ritual union between Purusha as (Shiva) and shakti, yet this union is essentially non-physical and universal, and thus for a master such as Abhinavagupta, he was always in communion with Shiva-Shakti. We can only speculate about whether he was physically chaste, and either answer to <b>this</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> not very meaningful in the context of his life and teachings. Abhinavagupta parallels Shiva as both ascetic and enjoyer.|$|E
