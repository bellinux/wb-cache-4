5|$|Tuberculosis {{prevention}} and control efforts rely {{primarily on the}} vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases. The World Health Organization has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening {{people who are at}} high risk for latent tuberculosis with either <b>tuberculin</b> skin tests or interferon-gamma release assays.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosing active {{tuberculosis}} {{based only on}} signs and symptoms is difficult, as is diagnosing the disease in those who are immunosuppressed. A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks. A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation. Interferon-γ release assays and <b>tuberculin</b> skin tests are of little use in the developing world. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) have similar limitations in those with HIV.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the most}} widely used vaccine worldwide, with more than 90% of all {{children}} being vaccinated. The immunity it induces decreases after about ten years. As tuberculosis is uncommon in most of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, BCG is administered to only those people at high risk. Part of the reasoning against the use of the vaccine is that it makes the <b>tuberculin</b> skin test falsely positive, reducing the test's use in screening. A number of new vaccines are currently in development.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{is spread}} through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active {{infection}} occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the <b>tuberculin</b> skin test (TST) or blood tests.|$|E
5|$|One-third of the world's {{population}} {{is thought to}} be infected with TB. New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. In 2016, there were more than 10 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.3 million deaths. This makes it the number one cause of death from an infectious disease. More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries, and more than 50% in India, China, Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines. The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000. About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 5–10% of people in the United States population tests positive by the <b>tuberculin</b> test. Tuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times.|$|E
5|$|The Mantoux <b>tuberculin</b> {{skin test}} {{is often used}} to screen people at high risk for TB. Those who have been {{previously}} immunized may have a false-positive test result. The test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, active tuberculosis. Interferon gamma release assays, on a blood sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test. These are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria, so they generate fewer false-positive results. However, they are affected by M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii. IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test, but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis is the second-most {{common cause}} of death from {{infectious}} disease (after those due to HIV/AIDS). The total number of tuberculosis cases has been decreasing since 2005, while new cases have decreased since 2002. China has achieved particularly dramatic progress, with about an 80% reduction in its TB mortality rate between 1990 and 2010. The number of new cases has declined by 17% between 2004 and 2014. Tuberculosis {{is more common in}} developing countries; about 80% of the population in many Asian and African countries test positive in <b>tuberculin</b> tests, while only 5–10% of the US population test positive. Hopes of totally controlling the disease have been dramatically dampened because of a number of factors, including the difficulty of developing an effective vaccine, the expensive and time-consuming diagnostic process, the necessity of many months of treatment, the increase in HIV-associated tuberculosis, and the emergence of drug-resistant cases in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the <b>tuberculin</b> skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997. Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.|$|E
25|$|The {{institute}} {{claimed to}} be the first in the Southern Hemisphere to produce standardised <b>tuberculin</b> on a large scale for testing tuberculosis in cattle. In 1898 Pound described the method developed at the institute for culturing the tubercle bacillus, and then purifying and standardising the extracted <b>tuberculin.</b> Refinements in bacteria growing conditions, filtering out contaminants, and the use of live animals to standardise each batch were seen as crucial in providing a reliable source for the <b>tuberculin</b> test.|$|E
25|$|Robert Koch {{developed}} <b>tuberculin</b> in 1890. Inoculated into {{individuals who}} have had tuberculosis, it produces a hypersensitivity reaction, and is still used to detect {{those who have been}} infected. However, Koch used <b>tuberculin</b> as a vaccine. This caused serious reactions and deaths in individuals whose latent tuberculosis was reactivated by the <b>tuberculin.</b> This was a major setback for supporters of new vaccines. Such incidents and others ensured that any untoward results concerning vaccination and related procedures received continued publicity, which grew as the number of new procedures increased.|$|E

25|$|A <b>tuberculin</b> test {{conversion}} {{is defined}} as an increase of 10mm or more within a 2-year period, regardless of age.|$|E
25|$|If {{a person}} has {{had a history of}} a {{positive}} <b>tuberculin</b> skin test, another skin test is not needed.|$|E
25|$|In case {{a second}} <b>tuberculin</b> test is {{necessary}} {{it should be}} {{carried out in the}} other arm to avoid hypersensitising the skin.|$|E
25|$|A {{standard}} dose of 5 <b>tuberculin</b> units (TU - 0.1 ml), {{according to}} the CDC, or 2 TU of Statens Serum Institute (SSI) <b>tuberculin</b> RT23 in 0.1 ml solution, {{according to the}} NHS, is injected intradermally (between the layers of dermis) and read 48 to 72 hours later. This intradermal injection is termed the Mantoux technique. A {{person who has been}} exposed to the bacteria is expected to mount an immune response in the skin containing the bacterial proteins.|$|E
25|$|A <b>tuberculin</b> test {{conversion}} {{is defined}} as an increase of 10mm or more within a two-day period, regardless of age. Alternative criteria include increases of 6, 12, 15 or 18mm.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} false {{positive}} {{results can be}} allergic reaction or hypersensitivity. Although rare, (about 0.08 reported reactions per million doses of <b>tuberculin),</b> these reactions can be dangerous and precautions should be taken by having epinephrin available.|$|E
25|$|In 1890 Koch {{developed}} <b>tuberculin,</b> a purified protein {{derivative of}} the bacteria. It {{proved to be an}} ineffective means of immunization but in 1908, Charles Mantoux found it was an effective intradermic test for diagnosing tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>tuberculin</b> skin tests such as (principally) the Mantoux test, interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) have become common in clinical {{use in the}} 2010s. In some contexts they are used instead of TSTs, whereas in other contexts TSTs and IGRAs both continue to be useful.|$|E
25|$|Abnormalities on chest radiographs may be suggestive of, {{but are not}} {{necessarily}} diagnostic of, TB. However, chest radiographs {{may be used to}} rule out the possibility of pulmonary TB in a person who has a positive reaction to the <b>tuberculin</b> skin test and no symptoms of the disease.|$|E
25|$|TST (<b>tuberculin</b> skin test) {{positive}} {{is measured}} by size of induration. The size of the induration {{considered to be a}} positive result depends on risk factors. For example, a low-risk patient must have a larger induration for a positive result than a high-risk patient. High-risk groups include recent contacts, those with HIV, those with chest radiograph with fibrotic changes, organ transplant recipients, and those with immunosuppression.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases of}} anergy, {{a lack of}} {{reaction}} by the body's defence mechanisms when it comes into contact with foreign substances, the <b>tuberculin</b> reaction will occur weakly, thus compromising the value of Mantoux testing. For example, anergy is present in AIDS, a disease which strongly depresses the immune system. Therefore, anergy testing is advised in cases where there is suspicion that anergy is present. However, routine anergy skin testing is not recommended.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people who}} have been {{infected}} with TB may have a negative reaction when tested years after infection, as the immune system response may gradually wane. This initial skin test, though negative, may stimulate (boost) the body's ability to react to <b>tuberculin</b> in future tests. Thus, a positive reaction to a subsequent test may be misinterpreted as a new infection, when in fact it {{is the result of the}} boosted reaction to an old infection.|$|E
25|$|MMR is {{most useful}} at {{detecting}} tuberculosis {{infection in the}} asymptomatic phase, {{and it should be}} combined with <b>tuberculin</b> skin tests and clinical questioning in order to be more effective. The sharp increase in tuberculosis in all countries with large exposure to HIV is probably mandating a return of MMR as a screening tool focusing on high-risk populations, such as homosexuals and intravenous drug users. New advances in digital radiography, coupled with much lower x-ray dosages may herald better MMR technologies.|$|E
25|$|Th1 {{helper cells}} are the host {{immunity}} effectors against intracellular bacteria and protozoa. They are triggered by IL-12, IL-2 and their effector cytokine is IFN-γ. The main effector cells of Th1 immunity are macrophages {{as well as}} CD8 T cells, IgG B cells, and IFN-γ CD4 T cells. The key Th1 transcription factors are STAT4 and T-bet. IFN-γ secreted by CD4 T cells can activate macrophages to phagocytose and digest intracellular bacteria and protozoa. In addition, IFN-γ can activate iNOS to produce NOx free radicals to directly kill intracellular bacteria and protozoa. Th1 overactivation against autoantigens will cause Type 4 delayed-type hypersensitivity. <b>Tuberculin</b> reaction or Type 1 diabetes belong to this category of autoimmunity.|$|E
500|$|Having {{proposed}} {{a model of}} globular proteins, Wrinch investigated whether it {{was consistent with the}} available structural data. [...] She hypothesized that bovine <b>tuberculin</b> protein (523) was a C1 closed cyclol consisting of 72 residues and that the digestive enzyme pepsin was a C2 closed cyclol of 288 residues. [...] These residue-number predictions were difficult to verify, since the methods then available to measure the mass of proteins were inaccurate, such as analytical ultracentrifugation and chemical methods.|$|E
2500|$|Except in neonates, a <b>tuberculin</b> {{skin test}} {{should always be}} done before {{administering}} BCG. [...] A reactive <b>tuberculin</b> skin test is a contraindication to BCG. [...] Someone with a positive <b>tuberculin</b> reaction is not given BCG, because the risk of severe local inflammation and scarring is high, {{not because of the}} common misconception that <b>tuberculin</b> reactors [...] "are already immune" [...] and therefore do not need BCG. [...] People found to have reactive <b>tuberculin</b> skin tests should be screened for active tuberculosis. BCG is also contraindicated in certain people [...] who have IL-12 receptor pathway defects.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Tuberculin</b> is a {{glycerol}} extract of the tubercle bacillus. [...] Purified protein derivative (PPD) <b>tuberculin</b> is a precipitate of species-nonspecific molecules {{obtained from}} filtrates of sterilized, concentrated cultures. The <b>tuberculin</b> reaction was first described by Robert Koch in 1890. The test was first developed and {{described by the}} German physician Felix Mendel in 1908 [...] It is named after Charles Mantoux, a French physician who built {{on the work of}} Koch and Clemens von Pirquet to create his test in 1907. However, the test was unreliable due to impurities in <b>tuberculin</b> which tended to cause false results.|$|E
2500|$|Esmond R. Long and Florence B. Seibert {{identified}} the active agent in <b>tuberculin</b> as a protein. [...] Seibert then spent {{a number of}} years developing methods for separating and purifying the protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, obtaining purified protein derivative (PPD) and enabling the creation of a reliable test for tuberculosis. [...] Her first publication on the purification of <b>tuberculin</b> appeared in 1934. By the 1940s, Seibert's PPD was the international standard for <b>tuberculin</b> tests. In 1939, M. A. Linnikova in the USSR created a modified version of PPD. In 1954, the Soviet Union started mass production of PPD-L, named after Linnikova.|$|E
2500|$|Reaction to the PPD or <b>tuberculin</b> test is {{suppressed}} {{by the following}} conditions: ...|$|E

2500|$|There is {{disagreement}} {{on the use}} of the Mantoux test on people who have been immunized with BCG. [...] The US recommendation is that in administering and interpreting the Mantoux test, previous BCG vaccination should be ignored; the UK recommendation is that interferon-γ tests should be used to help interpret positive <b>tuberculin</b> tests, also, the UK does not recommend serial <b>tuberculin</b> skin testing in people who have had BCG (a key part of the US strategy). [...] In their guidelines {{on the use of}} QuantiFERON Gold the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that whereas Quantiferon Gold is not affected by BCG inoculation <b>tuberculin</b> tests can be affected. [...] In general the US approach is likely to result in more false positives and more unnecessary treatment with potentially toxic drugs; the UK approach is as sensitive in theory and should also be more specific, because of the use of interferon-γ tests.|$|E
2500|$|The BCG vaccine {{can make}} cattle {{sensitive}} to the <b>tuberculin</b> skin test after vaccination. [...] this means the animal may have a positive result, {{even though it is}} not actually infected with M. bovis (a [...] "false positive‟). In parallel with developing the vaccine, Defra are developing a test to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals (so-called [...] "DIVA" [...] test). This test is based on gamma interferon blood test technology. [...] The intention is that when necessary, it can be used alongside the <b>tuberculin</b> skin test to confirm whether a positive skin test is caused by infection or vaccination. This is critical because without this differentiation, the UK could not be declared officially free of bTB, which is required by a 1964 European Economic Community directive for international trade. Given that in 2014 there is still no bTB vaccine for cattle that does not interfere with the <b>tuberculin</b> tests, such vaccination is prohibited under EU law.|$|E
2500|$|The role of Mantoux {{testing in}} {{people who have been}} vaccinated is disputed. [...] The US {{recommends}} that <b>tuberculin</b> skin testing is not contraindicated for BCG-vaccinated persons, and prior BCG vaccination should not influence the interpretation of the test. [...] The UK recommends that interferon-γ testing should be used to help interpret positive Mantoux tests, and repeated <b>tuberculin</b> skin testing must not be done {{in people who}} have had BCG vaccinations. In general, the US recommendation results in a much larger number of people being falsely diagnosed with latent tuberculosis, while the UK approach probably misses patients with latent tuberculosis who should be treated.|$|E
