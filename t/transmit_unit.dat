5000|$|The KW-37, code named JASON, was an {{encryption}} system developed In the 1950s by the U.S. National Security Agency to protect fleet broadcasts of the U.S. Navy. Naval doctrine calls for warships at sea to maintain radio silence {{to the maximum}} extent possible to prevent ships from being located by potential adversaries using radio direction finding. To allow ships to receive messages and orders, the navy broadcast a continuous stream of information, originally in Morse code and later using radioteletype. Messages were included in this stream as needed and could be for individual ships, battle groups or the fleet as a whole. Each ship's radio room would monitor the broadcast and decode and forward those messages directed at her to the appropriate officer. The KW-37 was designed to automate this process. It consisted of two major components, the KWR-37 receive unit and the KWT-37 <b>transmit</b> <b>unit.</b> Each ship had a complement of KWR-37 receivers (usually at least two) that decrypted the fleet broadcast and fed the output to teleprinter machines. KWT-37's were typically located at shore facilities, where high power transmitters were located.|$|E
40|$|In most systems, fair-queueing packet schedulers are the {{algorithms}} {{of choice}} for providing bandwidth and delay guarantees. These guarantees are computed assuming that the scheduler is directly attached to the <b>transmit</b> <b>unit</b> with no interposed buffering, and, for timestamp-based schedulers, that {{the exact number of}} bits transmitted is known when timestamps need to be updated. Unfortunately, both assumptions are unrealistic. In particular, real communication devices normally include FIFO queues (possibly very deep ones) between the scheduler and the <b>transmit</b> <b>unit.</b> And the presence of these queues does invalidate the proofs of the service guarantees of existing timestamp-based fair-queueing schedulers. In this paper we address these issues with the following two contributions. First, we show how to mod-ify timestamp-based, worst-case optimal and quasi-optimal fair-queueing schedulers so as to comply with the presence of FIFO queues, and with uncertainty on the number of bits transmitted. Second, we pro-vide analytical bounds of the actual guarantees provided, in these real-world conditions, both by modified timestamp-based fair-queueing schedulers and by basic round-robin schedulers. These results should help designers to make informed decisions and sound tradeoffs when building systems...|$|E

40|$|The idea of Media-based Modulation (MBM), {{is based}} on {{embedding}} information in the variations of the transmission media (channel state). This {{is in contrast to}} legacy wireless systems where data is embedded in a Radio Frequency (RF) source prior to the transmit antenna. MBM offers several advantages vs. legacy systems, including "additivity of information over multiple receive antennas", and "inherent diversity over a static fading channel". MBM is particularly suitable for transmitting high data rates using a single transmit and multiple receive antennas (Single Input-Multiple Output Media-Based Modulation, or SIMO-MBM). However, complexity issues limit the amount of data that can be embedded in the channel state using a single <b>transmit</b> <b>unit.</b> To address this shortcoming, the current article introduces the idea of Layered Multiple Input-Multiple Output Media-Based Modulation (LMIMO-MBM). Relying on a layered structure, LMIMO-MBM can significantly reduce both hardware and algorithmic complexities, as well as the training overhead, vs. SIMO-MBM. Simulation results show excellent performance in terms of Symbol Error Rate (SER) vs. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). For example, a 4 × 16 LMIMO-MBM is capable of transmitting 32 bits of information per (complex) channel-use, with SER ≃ 10 ^- 5 at E_b/N_ 0 ≃ - 3. 5 dB (or SER ≃ 10 ^- 4 at E_b/N_ 0 =- 4. 5 dB). This performance is achieved using a single transmission and without adding any redundancy for Forward-Error-Correction (FEC). This means, in addition to its excellent SER vs. energy/rate performance, MBM relaxes the need for complex FEC structures, and thereby minimizes the transmission delay. Overall, LMIMO-MBM provides a promising alternative to MIMO and Massive MIMO for the realization of 5 G wireless networks. Comment: 26 pages, 11 figures, additional examples are given to further explain the idea of Media-Based Modulation. Capacity figure adde...|$|E

40|$|The {{exponential}} growth of mobile device market has spurred considerable research interest. There are two killer applications of such market, namely wireless communication and positioning. Although the two application domains areseemingly diﬀerent,there is a unifying property {{between the two}} applications. The bandwidth dictates the key performance metrics, namely peak data rate and precision for wireless comunication and positioning system, respectively. To facilitate high bandwidth, mm-wave operation is necessary. However, wideband operation at mm-wave comes with a power penalty. Therefore, this doctoral work focuses on developing smart circuit solution to ensure an optimal solution that balances bandwidth, linearity, and energy saving requirement. The ﬁrst part of the dissertation addresses the energy eﬃciency issue of the GHz-wide multicarrier signal generation in an active tag (<b>transmit</b> <b>unit)</b> of a 60 GHz positioning system. Tackling the bandwidth problem is critical to achieve mm-precision. To {{come up with an}} optimum transmitter architecture, a holistic approach is employed in this work by means of hardware-algorithm co-design. The proposed architecture is thus geared to exploit the critical parameters for ranging, i. e. bandwidth and carrier frequency, and to eliminate the overhead circuit blocks caused by the ranging-irrelevant parameters. A proof of concept of the proposed 60 GHz transmitter is fabricated in a 40 -nm GP CMOS technology, which incorporates a baseband subcarrier generator, a modulator, and a 60 GHz power ampliﬁer. In this implementation, 16 subcarriers are generated with regular polarity inversion by means of an array of frequency division out of a 3 GHz input clock. The resulting BPSK-like waveform smartly ﬁlls the 6 GHz band at the 60 GHz band in a power optimized manner. Thanks to the low complexity yet eﬀective waveform and generation method, power hungry building blocks, namely linear mixer, Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC), and baseband ﬁlter are eliminated. From the measurement results, despite the harmonic rich spectrum due to the digital frequency divisions, a linear range computation is demonstrated. A standard deviation of 0. 7 - 2. 7 mm is achieved within the 5 m measured distance with 5. 4 µs symbol duration. During the operation, the baseband subcarrier generator consumes an average power of 1. 8 mW out of 0. 9 V supply. The modulator and the power ampliﬁer altogether consume 127 mW. The total area of the transmitter is 1. 1 mm 2. With such minimum area and power overhead, an optimal architecture is demonstrated to handle the compromise between the linearity and the average power consumption while meeting the mm-precision and ms-update rate target. The novelty {{in the second part of}} the dissertation lies within the transistor-level circuit design, whereby a mm-wave Doherty power ampliﬁer is designed for 5 G applications. In the upcoming 5 G standard, a data rate in the range of tens of Gb/s is expected which motivates the shift towards mm-wave to gain more spectral real estate. On top of that, higher order modulation schemes and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) are expected to be employed to cram more bits in the band. These measures result in large Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR), forcing the PA to backoﬀ up to 9 dB to maintain the linearity. With its prominent feature of eﬃciency enhancement at power backoﬀ, the Doherty PA is considered the best candidate to address the problem. However, further research is needed to extend its bandwidth up to 2 GHz range and enable the ampliﬁcation of multi-Gb/s data rate linearly. A 28 - 34 GHz transformer-based Doherty ampliﬁer is fabricated in a 28 -nm CMOS process as a proof-of-concept. This chip features wideband AM-PM compensation of the Doherty constituents, which addresses the wideband linearity issues of the Doherty topology. Furthermore, to achieve high power in the 28 -nm CMOS technology, this work also features parallel-series-parallel power combining. Thanks to all of these techniques, the proposed Doherty ampliﬁer supports the ampliﬁcation of a 64 -QAM signal with data rate of 15 Gb/s and achieves PSAT of 19. 8 dBm. These numbers are the state-of-art performance in the 28 nm bulk CMOS technology. In conclusion, the two proof-of-concepts of the two key application domains namely wireless communication and positioning system have demonstrated that high bandwidth, and thus mm-wave operation, are critical to achieve the respective key performance metrics. Based on this conclusion, we propose two solutions in the architecture level and the circuit level, respectively, to minimize the energy consumption such that the target precision and data rate are reached despite the mm-wave operation. nrpages: 226 status: publishe...|$|E
