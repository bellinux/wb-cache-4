30|$|Eye {{movements}} were recorded with a Tobii T 1750 eye tracker at a sampling rate of 50  Hz. Participants were seated {{in front of}} a computer monitor at a distance of 60  cm. Infrared eye tracking cameras are integrated into this monitor allowing participants to freely move their head. Each fixation had to last at least 100  ms to be recorded by the eye tracker and the fixation field corresponds to a 50 -pixel radius circle. The functional field of view of the participant thus corresponds to a visual angle of approximately 2 °. As well as analyzing fixations in the AOIs illustrated in Figs.  1 and 2, we also assessed fixations on specific aircraft during the 15  s following a change; that is, a fixation on a critically changed aircraft during that time window would be classified as a fixated rather than a non-fixated change. A critical change was considered fixated if the aircraft which underwent the change (or the associated change entry in the <b>tool</b> <b>table</b> when available) fell within 50  pixels of the center point of a fixation at least once during the 15 -s post-change period and if this fixation lasted at least 100  ms.|$|E
40|$|No genome is {{an island}} Genomes can never be {{considered}} as isolated datasets or ‘islands’. Rather, they must be viewed and interpreted {{in the context of}} the large amount of molecular data available in public databases. We now have a vast collection of genomes in our public databases. This collection contains more than 2500 genomes from bacteria (> 200), viruses (> 1200), plasmids (> 600), eukaryotes (> 30) and organelles (> 500) (Field et al., 2005; Wheeler et al., 2005). While there are numerous resources for the study of genomes we focus here on databases and software for the study of complete prokaryotic genomes. First-generation tools focused on the study of a single genome, and the majority of genomic resources developed to date identify features in individual genomes expressly for the sake of functional annotation. Now there is an obvious shift towards the creation of tools that allow the viewing and manipulation of data in a comparative genomic context. While many of these ‘next-generation’ comparative genomics databases and software packages combine information from multiple sources to ‘decorate’ a single target genome with finer detail, there are also truly comparative genomic tools that leverage the information in multiple genomes simultaneously. Tools that allow the direct comparison of two or more genomes are becoming increasingly common (Darling et al., 2004; Hohl et al., 2002; Kurtz et al., 2004). For example, the Artemis Comparison <b>Tool</b> (<b>Table</b> 1) provides a visualization of BLAST hits between two complete genome sequences, thus allowing rapid examination of the degree of synteny (conservation in gene order), major genomic rearrangements, or the integration of novel genomic islands, phages or other ‘foreign ’ elements.

The MDM is determined through combining the highest level achieved in {{two out of three}} of the tables in the audit <b>tool</b> (<b>Table</b> A: The Diagnostic and Management Options, Table B: Amount and Complexity of Data Reviewed, and Table C: the Risk Table). If the documentation of the history or the exam is insufficient to reach the code level that could have been achieved by way of the MDM level, the E/M level will only be at the highest possible code allowed relative to the documentation deficiency discovered. Following are some examples: If the HPI only has two (2) elements, the highest code choice for governmental payers is 99283; If the Review of Systems has less than 10 systems listed without comment (e. g., "All other systems reviewed and negative " or similar), the maximum code choice would be at 99284; If only one (1) item is listed for Past, Family and/or Social history, the maximum code choice would be 99284.

40|$|Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. brasiliense is {{a member}} of the soft rot Enterobacteriaceae (SRE) family that causes tuber soft rot and {{blackleg}} diseases of stems in potato plants. Currently, there are no effective chemical strategies for the control of members of the SRE. Thus, an understanding of the inducible defense responses in stems of potato plants is important, particularly during colonization of the vascular system. Here, time-course RNA-sequencing analysis was used to compare expressed genes between a susceptible potato cultivar (Solanum tuberosum cv Valor) and a tolerant cultivar (S. tuberosum cv BP 1) at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 72 h post-inoculation with P. c. brasiliense. In total, we identified 6139 and 8214 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the tolerant and susceptible cultivars, compared to mock-inoculated controls, respectively. Key DEGs distinguishing between tolerance and susceptibility were associated with negative regulation of cell death and plant-type cell wall organization/biogenesis biological processes in the tolerant and susceptible cultivars, respectively. Among these were DEGs involved in signaling (mainly MAPK cascade and ethylene pathway), defense-related transcription regulation including WRKY transcription factors, and downstream secondary cell biosynthesis. Together, our results suggest that S. tuberosum cv BP 1 likely employs quantitative defense response against P. c. brasiliense. Overall, our study provides the first transcriptome-wide insight into the molecular basis of tolerance and/or resistance of potato stems to SRE infection. Figure S 1.

40|$|Deoxy{{ribonucleic acid}} (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) {{are among the}} most {{remarkable}} biomolecules occurring in nature, since they store and transfer all genetic information using only four letters (G, C, A & T or U). In the last 60 years, since the discovery of the structure of nucleic acids, numerous chemically modified nucleosides and nucleotides have been produced and incorporated into oligomeric sequences either by chemical or enzymatic synthesis. These molecules were primarily designed to increase the complexity and stability of natural biopolymers for the development of nucleic acid-based drugs and, lately, for various biotechnological purposes. While many synthetic biopolymers are currently available, none of those possessing all four modified bases {{has been found to be}} functional in vivo. Here, we pose an intriguing and challenging question: “What would happen if we could evolve a novel fully-modified genetic system within a cell?” These redesigned biomolecules with improved stability in serum could potentially open new horizons in the development of advanced therapeutics. The biomolecule template with all four artificial nucleobases could mimic the genetic functions of DNA and RNA in a cell. The fully morphed genetic alphabet could also encourage investigations on the in vitro evolution of nucleic acids enriching their complexity and functional diversity. The replacement of the original biomolecules by a third type of nucleic acid might foster the evolution of chemically redesigned cells and safe genetically modified organisms. Based on this premise, this doctoral thesis aims at exploring artificial nucleic acids with altered nucleobase or sugar moieties as versatile analogs of natural biopolymers. Non-canonical nucleotide analogs, containing 7 -substituted- 7 -deaza- or 8 -substituted-purines as nucleobases pairing with 5 -substituted pyrimidines, were chosen to construct an unprecented genetic information system in vivo (DZA). Another alternative biopolymer, namely, 1, 5 -anhydrohexitol nucleic acid (HNA), was selected for the development of specific inhibitors against the therapeutically relevant target Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). These studies intend to develop chemically modified nucleic acids for their subsequent application as a stable and safe tool for therapeutics and biotechnology. These redesigned nucleic acids can be used as genetic elements to code for functional proteins with desired functions (DZA) or specifically inhibit target biomolecules in a host organism (HNA). Alternative genetic molecules with increased stability in the biological environment could improve the existing therapeutics as well as assist in the development of new advanced nucleic acid drugs. Moreover, modified nucleic acid modules may open new perspectives in the understanding of the enzymatic pathways by interacting with the target molecules. In the first project (Chapters 2 - 4), a chemically redesigned DNA analog, in which all four nucleobases are functionalized (denoted as DZA), was investigated. In Chapter 2, the synthetic DZA biomolecules composed of 5 -Cl-dU, 7 -deaza-dA, 5 -F-dC, and 7 -deaza-dG were used to transfer the genetic information in living organisms. By using a gene encoding resistance to the antibiotic trimethoprim, we demonstrated that a fully morphed DNA was successfully replicated in vitro and served as genetic template in vivo. In Chapter 3, we describe in more details the choice of the 5 -Cl-dU: 7 -deaza-dA base pair as an excellent alternative to the natural dT:dA. The role of 5 -Cl-dU as a possible component of a chemically modified genome has been discussed regarding its influence on duplex stability and DNA polymerase incorporation properties. The search for its counterpart among different deoxyadenosine analogs showed that a stable duplex formation as well as the synthesis of long constructs, more than 2 kb, were successful with the 5 -Cl-dU: 7 -deaza-dA combination in the presence of Taq DNA polymerase. In the study described in Chapter 4, we focused on the selection of a second dG:dC base pair alternative to complete the four-base artificial genetic alphabet. The search for optimal combinations of the synthetic purine-pyrimidine base pairs was based on their enzymatic biocompatibility. We demonstrated that the naturally occurring four DNA letters A, T, G, and C can be successfully replaced by 7 -deazapurines and 5 -substituted pyrimidines during in vitro replication of random oligonucleotide libraries as well as extended 1. 5 kb genetic templates. The most fruitful combinations include: 7 -deaza-dG or 7 -F-deaza-dG pairing with 5 -F-dC or 5 -Me-dC together with the 5 -Cl-dU: 7 -deaza-dA base pair. The in vitro replication of a 0. 5 kb fragment was also achieved with a nucleotide set containing dI: 5 -Br-dC and 5 -Cl-dU: 7 -deaza-dA, although it was not successful in the synthesis of a short random DZA library. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the modified segments can selectively block restriction enzymes, and still be able to bypass the bacterial replication machinery. These evidences make the fully morphed nucleic acids highly promising for synthetic biology and biotechnological applications. We demonstrated that DZA segments could be used to produce diverse DNA libraries and extended PCR fragments, as well as to control restriction enzyme cleavage or synthesize functional genetic templates. In Chapter 5, the generation of HNA aptamers was described. We successfully evolved high-affinity HNA-RNA hybrid aptamers against rat VEGF 164 starting from a completely random library using just seven rounds of in vitro selection. The selected aptamers exhibited affinity in the picomolar range to their target protein and possessed a remarkable stability against DNase I. The last chapter (Chapter 6) summarizes the obtained results and includes prospects and future plans. Overall our results demonstrate that chemically redesigned biomolecules different from natural DNA/RNA can code and accurately transfer the genetic information in living cells, as well as providing stable inhibitors against therapeutic targets. At the forefront of research in synthetic biology and therapy, our next goal is to explore whether these synthetic molecules can be used for more complicated tasks such as the development of advanced therapy and a genetic manipulation <b>tool.</b> <b>Table</b> of Contents Acknowledgements	i Table of Contents	iii Summary	v Samenvatting	viii Abbreviations	xi 1 	Chapter 1 | General Introduction	 1 1. 1 	Types of XNA biomolecules	 2 1. 1. 1 	Base-modified XNAs (base-XNAs) 	 4 1. 1. 2 	Sugar-modified XNAs (sugar-XNAs) 	 8 1. 2 	Applications of XNA molecules	 9 1. 2. 1 	Aptamer selection	 10 1. 2. 2 	Synthetic biology	 15 1. 3 	Objectives	 20 1. 4 	References	 22 2 	Chapter 2 | Chemical morphing of DNA containing four noncanonical bases	 27 2. 1 	Introduction	 28 2. 2 	Results and Discussion	 29 2. 3 	Conclusions	 36 2. 4 	Experimental Section	 37 2. 5 	References	 40 2. 6 	Supporting Information	 43 3 	Chapter 3 | The 5 -Cl-dU: 7 -deaza-dA as an alternative to the dT:dA base pair	 55 3. 1 	Introduction	 56 3. 2 	Results and Discussion	 58 3. 2. 1 	Physicochemical studies	 58 3. 2. 2 	Primer extension studies	 60 3. 2. 3 	PCR amplification studies	 61 3. 3 	Conclusions	 65 3. 4 	Experimental Section	 66 3. 5 	References	 69 3. 6 	Supporting Information	 71 4 	Chapter 4 | Base-modified nucleic acids as a powerful tool for synthetic biology and biotechnology	 83 4. 1 	Introduction	 84 4. 2 	Results and Discussion	 86 4. 2. 1 	Incorporation of seven guanosine triphosphate analogs	 86 4. 2. 2 	Incorporation of dGxTP and dCxTP analogs using a regular 57 mer template	 88 4. 2. 3 	PCR with various dGxTP and dCxTP analogs using a regular 57 mer template	 91 4. 2. 4 	Synthesis of a fully substituted random library	 93 4. 2. 5 	PCR of 149 bp and 360 bp fragments with different modified dNTP	 95 4. 2. 6 	PCR amplification of long modified fragments	 96 4. 2. 7 	PCR of DZA fragments with different high-fidelity DNA polymerases	 98 4. 2. 8 	Fully modified genetic templates containing dI and 5 -Br-dC in vivo	 99 4. 2. 9 	Recognition of modified fragments by various restriction enzymes	 102 4. 3 	Conclusions	 107 4. 4 	Experimental Section	 108 4. 5 	References	 112 4. 6 	Supporting Information	 115 5 	Chapter 5 | Selection of 1, 5 -anhydrohexitol aptamers against the rat vascular endothelial growth factor 164 	 133 5. 1 	Introduction	 134 5. 2 	Results	 136 5. 2. 1 	HNA library synthesis	 136 5. 2. 2 	Target preparation	 138 5. 2. 3 	HNA aptamer selection procedure	 141 5. 2. 4 	Aptamers analysis	 143 5. 3 	Discussion	 148 5. 4 	Experimental Section	 150 5. 5 	References	 155 5. 6 	Supporting Information	 157 6 	Chapter 6 | Concluding Discussion	 165 7 	CV | Elena Eremeeva	 175 nrpages: 193 status: publishe...|$|E
