40|$|Microgeneration technologies, such as solar {{photovoltaics}} (PV), {{have recently}} been cited as a potential solution to energy policy challenges such as climate change and security of supply. International {{evidence suggests that the}} benefit of a PV installation will depend on both the amount of electricity generated and the technology’s influence on energy consumption behaviour. This study seeks to quantify and explain this ‘double-dividend’ effect by examining photovoltaics in the UK domestic sector. Questionnaire and interview data were collected from owner-occupier PV households, revealing that the installation of PV increased awareness of electricity generation and consumption in the home. Guided by monitoring devices, an overall electricity saving (~ 8 %) and load-shifting behaviours were observed. Although the installation of PV followed a series of other energy-saving measures, respondents showed an ongoing commitment to environmentally responsible behaviour and further reduction of the carbon footprint of household energy consumption. PV household electricity data and interviews with industry and government found that electricity <b>tariffs,</b> <b>metering</b> and other institutional constraints were important determinants of a household’s behavioural response.

40|$|Recently, {{the cost}} for Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and the other {{distributed}} energy resources have become more affordable at the household level, especially photovoltaics (PV) and storage batteries. With this, the possibility of households to become “prosumers” (producers and consumers of energy at the same time) becomes an attractive alternative due to the opportunity to save on the electricity bill costs. The traditional concept where a household can only purchase from the grid becomes outdated; this also triggers the concern of “death spiral. ” The reinforcing loop where the increase of the prosumers can provoke them to defect from the grid and force the utilities to increase their tariffs in order to cover their network grid and additional policies cost. Where in the past, this kind of condition was unlikely to happen. Due to household consumers are usually the least elastic and ended up carrying {{the burden of the}} of the cost because this type of end user will not change their consumption by much, even if prices increase greatly (Alleman, 1999; Ramsey, 1927). This research is using Vensim software to build and run a model of the Spanish household market based on System Dynamics (SD) methodology. The model is using six different scenarios that tested into four kinds of combinations of policy: no net <b>metering</b> and mixed <b>tariff,</b> no net <b>metering</b> and volumetric <b>tariffs,</b> net <b>metering</b> and volumetric <b>tariffs,</b> and net <b>metering</b> with mixed <b>tariff.</b> On top of that, the possibility of exit charges and network-only regulation charges were also being tested on those four combinations of policy, to see about the potential possibility of the “death spiral” in the Spanish household market. Results indicated that there is less possibility for the “death spiral” happening in Spain’s household market. Interestingly, cost recovery aside the concept of net metering leads to less to none of the grid defection, and without net metering, it is encouraging households to defect from the grid. Other results are fixed-network regulation cost can dampen grid disconnection, {{but at the same time}} delayed the RES adoption, and exit charges managed to prevent grid defection. Other alternatives are needed to be explored in order to foster RES, efficient market mechanisms need to be designed in order to put in level playing field different technologies at different scales and not incentivizing certain technologies with non-transparent cost shifting among consumers as net-metering does.

40|$|Artículos en revistasNet-metering is {{commonly}} known as a practice by which owners of distributed generation (DG) units may offset their electricity consumption from the grid with local generation. The increasing number of prosumers (consumers that both produce and consume electricity) with solar photovoltaic (PV) generation combined with net-metering results in reduced incomes for many network utilities worldwide. Consequently, this pushes utilities to increase charges per kW h in order to recover costs. For non-PV owners, this could result into inequality issues {{due to the fact that}} also non-PV owners have to pay higher chargers for their electricity consumed to make up for netted costs of PV-owners. In order to provide insight in those inequality issues caused by net-metering, this study presents the effects on cross-subsidies, cost recovery and policy objectives evolving from different applied netmetering and tariff designs for a residential consumer. Eventually this paper provides recommendations regarding <b>tariffs</b> and <b>metering</b> that will result in more explicit incentives for PV, instead of the current implicit incentives which are present to PV owners due to net-metering. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|We {{design a}} socially-efficient water tariff in the {{institutional}} context of England, where water metering is largely optional and non-metered households are levied {{proportional to the}} rateable value (RV) of their property. Within this context, it is theoretically demonstrated that: the larger the RV, the more likely the household to opt for metering; and the larger the RV, the smaller the Demand Effect of Metering (DEM; the fall in water consumption resulting from metering). These two hypotheses are confirmed with econometric analyses using datasets provided by a water company operating in East Anglia, England. The results signify an adverse-selection problem: wealthier households {{are more likely to}} opt for metering, yet they are expected to exhibit a smaller DEM once a meter is installed. In order to overcome this, we propose a two-part <b>tariff</b> for <b>metered</b> households consisting of: a variable charge levied proportional to water consumption at a uniform price; and a progressive standing charge to place a heavier burden on wealthier households.
