5|$|The {{election}} {{was too close}} <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>on</b> election night.

Official results showed that Stanley won the election by 471 votes, the closest gubernatorial vote in the state's history.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} {{has the authority}} <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>on</b> the General Assembly to convene a special session if legislators are unable to complete necessary work within time allotted by the regular sessions. Special sessions of the General Assembly were rarely called in the state's early history, but have become more commonplace in modern times.|$|E
5|$|He was {{promoted}} to lieutenant-general on 25 April 1808, and in June was given command of 9,000 men set to invade revolutionary Spanish America. But in 1807, Napoleon had invaded Portugal, via Spain, intent on preventing its continued trade with Britain. He replaced the Spanish royal family with his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte, in May 1808. In Madrid, the people attempted a rebellion against the French occupation which spread across Spain resulting in mass executions in reprisal, leading both the Portuguese and Spanish juntas (local administrations) <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>on</b> British support.|$|E

5|$|Hitler made a {{prominent}} {{appearance at the}} trial of two Reichswehr officers, Lieutenants Richard Scheringer and Hans Ludin, in late 1930. Both were charged with membership in the NSDAP, at that time illegal for Reichswehr personnel. The prosecution argued that the NSDAP was an extremist party, prompting defence lawyer Hans Frank <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>on</b> Hitler to testify. On 25 September 1930, Hitler testified that his party would pursue political power solely through democratic elections, which won him many supporters in the officer corps.|$|E
5|$|No {{consensus}} {{has been}} reached on {{who was responsible for}} the assassination. In August 2014, an online petition was started using the White House online petition mechanism <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>on</b> the government to release without alteration any files they still held relating to the murder of Malcolm X. The petition failed to attract enough signatures to mandate a White House response.|$|E
5|$|The play's {{jury has}} {{sometimes}} enlisted famous participants; the Broadway selections were rigged <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>on</b> celebrities {{known to be}} in the audience. The jury for the Broadway opening included attorney EdwardJ. Reilly—who was known from the Lindbergh kidnapping trial earlier that year—and boxing champion Jack Dempsey. At a special performance for the blind, Helen Keller sat on the jury. The practice of using celebrity jurors continued throughout the Broadway run and in other productions.|$|E

5|$|According to Ammianus, a deserter {{informed}} Chnodomar that Julian had 13,000 {{men with}} him at Saverne. But this leaves {{open the possibility that}} he may have summoned more to join him for the battle. It is possible that Severus' division was additional, as it is stated that while Julian was at Saverne, Severus' men occupied a separate camp near Barbatio's army. Libanius implies that Julian had 15,000 men under his command. If this was true, the additional 2,000 may have been Severus' division. Also, Julian may have been able <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>on</b> some limitanei units to join his comitatus for the campaign. Zosimus states that on arrival in Gaul, Julian set about a major recruitment drive. This would mainly have aimed at reconstituting limitanei regiments that had largely dissolved during the years of anarchy. Julian's force may therefore have numbered somewhat more than 15,000.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reform was}} that Austria, having lost many officers, veteran and elite troops, and regulars, and unable <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>on</b> allies, embraced the Levée en masse used earlier by the French. By this time, the French were {{moving from the}} Levée en masse in favour of forming a regular army based on a core of battle-hardened and elite veterans. In a strange {{reversal}} of the earlier Napoleonic Wars, where Frenchmen with little experience and often pressed into service fought against the professional Austrian army, a massive amount of Austrian conscripts, with no experience and only basic training and equipment would be sent into the field against a highly trained, campaign-hardened, and well-equipped French Grande Armée.|$|E
5|$|English naval {{power was}} vital to Edward I's {{successful}} campaigns in Scotland from 1296, using largely merchant ships from England, Ireland {{and his allies}} in the Islands to transport and supply his armies. Part {{of the reason for}} Robert I's success was his ability <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>on</b> naval forces from the Islands. As a result of the expulsion of the Flemings from England in 1303, he gained the support of a major naval power in the North Sea. The development of naval power allowed Robert to successfully defeat English attempts to capture him in the Highlands and Islands and to blockade major English controlled fortresses at Perth and Stirling, the last forcing Edward II to attempt the relief that resulted at English defeat at Bannockburn in 1314. Scottish naval forces allowed invasions of the Isle of Man in 1313 and 1317 and Ireland in 1315. They were also crucial in the blockade of Berwick, which led to its fall in 1318.|$|E

5|$|General Grant had Commander Henry Walke {{bring the}} Carondelet up the Cumberland River {{to create a}} {{diversion}} by opening fire on the fort. The Confederates responded with shots from their long-range guns and eventually hit the gunboat. Walke retreated several miles below the fort, but soon returned and continued shelling the water batteries. General McClernand, in the meantime, had been attempting to stretch his men toward the river but ran into difficulties with a Confederate battery of guns. McClernand ultimately decided {{that he did not}} have enough men to stretch all the way to the river, so Grant decided <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>on</b> more troops. He sent orders to General Wallace, who had been left behind at Fort Henry, to bring his men to Fort Donelson.|$|E
5|$|Sarwar became interim leader {{following}} Lamont's resignation, {{and announced}} plans for the party to hold a leadership contest, with the winner to be announced on 13 December. Sarah Boyack became {{the first person to}} confirm that she would be standing as a candidate for party leader; she was subsequently joined by Neil Findlay and Jim Murphy. Katy Clark and Kezia Dugdale entered the deputy leadership race. Findlay was among those <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>on</b> former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown to enter the contest, but he ruled out doing so. Other senior Labour figures who decided not to put their names forward included Sarwar, Jackie Baillie, and Jenny Marra.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Hitler {{had come}} into power, he had started to make plans to rebuild the chancellery. At the end of 1933 he {{contracted}} Paul Troost to renovate the entire building. Hitler appointed Speer, whose work for Goebbels had impressed him, to manage the building site for Troost. As Chancellor, Hitler had a residence in the building and came by every day to be briefed by Speer and the building supervisor {{on the progress of}} the renovations. After one of these briefings, Hitler invited Speer to lunch, to the architect's great excitement. Hitler evinced considerable interest in Speer during the luncheon, and later told Speer that he had been looking for a young architect capable of carrying out his architectural dreams for the new Germany. Speer quickly became part of Hitler's inner circle; he was expected <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>on</b> Hitler in the morning for a walk or chat, to provide consultation on architectural matters, and to discuss Hitler's ideas. Most days he was invited to dinner.|$|E

5|$|Unknown to the brigade, {{units of}} the German 1st Parachute Division had parachuted onto Catania {{airfield}} to reinforce the Italians guarding the bridge and quickly moved to regain the crossing. The German paratroops attacked at dawn. The defenders at the bridge held out all day against infantry, armour and attacks by aircraft. South of the bridge, the 2nd Parachute Battalion also under attack, were able <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>on</b> naval gunfire support from the 6inch guns of the British cruiser , which stopped an assault {{that was about to}} overrun their position. The men from the 1st and 3rd Battalions, although initially forced across the river, still held the southern bank until dark when they withdrew to the 2nd Battalion's position.|$|E
5|$|By April 1943, Western Area {{controlled}} four combat units: No.14 Squadron, flying Bristol Beaufort reconnaissance-bombers out of Pearce; No.25 Squadron, {{tasked with}} dive-bombing missions in Wirraways based at Pearce; No.76 Squadron, flying P-40 Kittyhawks out of Potshot (Exmouth Gulf); and No.85 Squadron, operating CAC Boomerang fighters from Pearce. The area command was also able <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>on</b> US Navy Catalinas of Patrol Wing10, based at Crawley, for reconnaissance and anti-submarine missions. The Beauforts and Catalinas flew several hundred maritime patrols during 1943. In March 1944, Western Area went {{on high alert}} in response to concerns that a Japanese naval force would raid Western Australia. Perth was reinforced with Nos.452 and 457 Squadrons, and Exmouth Gulf with Nos.18, 31, and 120 Squadrons, but no attack ensued and the units were directed {{to return to their}} home bases. The US Navy withdrew Patrol Wing10 mid-year, curtailing Western Area's ability to conduct long-range maritime reconnaissance; No.14 Squadron's fifteen serviceable Beauforts had to fly patrols of up to twenty-two hours in duration to search for German submarines reported in the area. As of 31May 1944, Western Area headquarters staff numbered 686, including 118 officers.|$|E
5|$|On day two, {{problems}} in Arnhem forced Hicks {{to change the}} divisional plan. Only the 2nd Parachute Battalion had reached the road bridge—strong German defences had halted the other battalions so Hicks decided that the Staffords would link up with the 1st Parachute Brigade {{in an attempt to}} reach their objective. However, the Staffords also failed to break through the German defenders. Bad weather over England kept the planned second lift on the ground. The first troops did not arrive until 15:00, a delay that gave the Germans time to approach the landing grounds and engage the KOSB in numerous probing attacks on the northern perimeter. At one stage KOSB commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Payton-Reid led a bayonet charge to clear the Germans from the area. Meanwhile, the Borders were repeatedly attacked from the south of landing zone's 'X' and 'Z', and were eventually forced <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>on</b> the 75mm guns of the 1st Airlanding Light Regiment to break up the attacks. Hicks had previously decided to send the Staffords on the second lift to join their battalion fighting in Arnhem, while he also sent the 11th Parachute Battalion on the same lift to support 1st Parachute Brigade. The KOSB, until then responsible for defending the landing ground, were attached to 4th Parachute Brigade to replace the 11th Parachute Battalion. However they were still responsible for defending landing ground 'L', for the arrival of the Poles gliders on day three. This left only the Borders, No. 2 Wing GPR and the field ambulance under brigade command.|$|E

Other recommendations were made, but this section remains the most underdeveloped of the Commission’s report. Although calls for ‘innovative financing mechanisms’ were made, no specifics were provided.|$|R
5|$|Ranariddh {{was elected}} as FUNCINPEC's {{president}} in February 1992. Subsequently, in August 1992, FUNCINPEC formally registered {{itself as a}} political party under the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) administration, and started opening party offices across Cambodia the following month. However, party offices and officials faced harassment and attacks from State of Cambodia (SOC) secret police and military intelligence officials. Between November 1992 and January 1993, 18 FUNCINPEC officials were killed and another 22 officials wounded, prompting Ranariddh <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>on</b> UNTAC to intervene and end the violence. UNTAC responded by setting up a special prosecutor's office to investigate cases of political violence, but faced resistance from the SOC police in arresting and prosecuting offenders. Most of the violent attacks occurred in the Kampong Cham and Battambang provinces, whereby the governor in the latter province, Ung Sami {{was found to have}} been directly involved in the attacks. When UNTAC allowed election campaigns to start in April 1993, FUNCINPEC held few election rallies due to intimidations from SOC police. They campaigned through low-key methods, such as using pick-up trucks to travel around the country and broadcast political messages as well as sending party workers to visit villages in the countryside.|$|E
