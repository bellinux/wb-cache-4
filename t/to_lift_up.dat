5|$|Meanwhile, Chris has a pimple on {{his face}} which he names “Doug.” Lois worries about Chris, as Doug tells Chris to make some mischief. He goes to the Swansons' house and sets a bag of feces on fire on their porch, and writes “That’s enough, John Mayer” in spraypaint {{on the wall of}} the Quahog Mini-Mart. Lois sees Chris sneaking back into his room and is going to punish him but Chris tells her that Doug said he does not have to listen to her. This outrages Lois, {{deciding}} to go to Goldman's Pharmacy the next day and get some astringent to get rid of Doug. However, the next day, as Peter and Lois head to Goldman’s, they realize there has been a break-in, and someone has destroyed Mort’s entire stock of acne medication. That night, when Brooke comes over for dinner to meet Brian’s family, Doug tells Chris <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> Brooke’s shirt, while Stewie asks how long Brooke has been a hooker. He does this, shocking and offending the family. Joe comes in, saying he has proof that it was Chris who vandalized, broke into Goldman’s Pharmacy and stole Mort's acne medication. Chris decides he no longer wants to listen to Doug after he made his mom cry, but Doug says he could make Chris punch himself, or even worse, shoot him in the brain. Chris finally winds up at the dermatology clinic, and a struggle ensues as Doug tries to shoot him in the brain, but Chris manages to overpower him and use cortisone on Doug, finally taking him out.|$|E

500|$|The show {{opened with}} Sabu versus Abyss in the (first-ever) [...] "Barbed Wire Massacre", {{in which the}} ring ropes were {{replaced}} with barbed wire, {{and the only way}} to win was by pinfall or submission. James Mitchell accompanied Abyss to the ring. The duration of the contest was 10 minutes and 59 seconds. Early in the bout Sabu was pushed face-first into the barbed wire ropes as a result of Abyss kicking out of a pin attempt. Later, Abyss lifted up and dropped Sabu face-first into the barbed wire ropes. After this Sabu used a sharp weapon, which he had hidden under his belt, to stab Abyss in the arm repeatedly. Abyss was next to fall into the barbed wire after Sabu tripped him as he ran. A barbed wire wrapped steel was introduced in the match, which Sabu used to bash Abyss over the head. A barbed wire covered board was pushed into the ring after this by Sabu, which Abyss used <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> and drop Sabu on. Another barbed wire covered board was introduced following this, with Sabu causing Abyss to run into it. He then pushed Abyss onto the other one and covered him for the pin to win the encounter.|$|E
500|$|The {{main event}} was a Three Way match for what ring {{announcer}} Jeremy Borash {{described as the}} [...] "TNA X Division Championship of the World", in which then-champion Christopher Daniels defended against the challengers A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe. Its duration was 22 minutes and 50 seconds. The match began with Joe and Styles double teaming Daniels, with the two engaging in a kicking competition against Daniels' back to see who could kick the hardest. While Daniels and Joe stood at ringside, Styles used the ropes to slingshot himself {{up into the air}} where he performed a backflip onto both competitors in what Styles' named the Shooting Styles Press. Later back in the ring, Daniels grabbed Styles and fell backwards in the process causing Styles to flip overhead towards Joe. Styles landed on Joe's shoulders and quickly fell backwards, flipping Joe forward. A few minutes later, Joe held Daniels in his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold, which was broken when Styles ascended a padded turnbuckle and jumped off to perform his signature Spiral Tap aerial technique, landing onto Daniels and Joe. Afterwards, Styles and Daniels fought {{on the top of a}} turnbuckle, with Joe ascending as well in order <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> both and throw them off in a suplex. Joe followed by performing his signature Muscle Buster maneuver on Styles, forcing him back and neck-first into the mat. Daniels then attempted to hit Joe with the TNA X Division Title belt, which Joe countered into a powerslam. Daniels then followed by kicking the belt into the side of Joe's head. Styles eventually gained the pinfall on Daniels after countering Daniels' signature Angel's Wings maneuver into a bridging pin to win the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E

2500|$|Yuan Shao lost to his rival, Cao Cao, at the Battle of Guandu in 200 CE {{and died}} two years later. After his death, his sons Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang became embroiled in internecine struggles over their father's vast domain. When the Yuan {{brothers}} were exhausted from their wars against each other, Cao Cao attacked and defeated them, swiftly conquering the territories {{that used to be}} controlled by the Yuans. In 204, Cao Cao defeated Yuan Shang at the Battle of Ye and his forces occupied the city. Cao Cao's son, Cao Pi, entered Yuan Shao's residence and met Lady Liu (Yuan Shao's widow) and Lady Zhen. Lady Zhen was so terrified that she buried her face in her mother-in-law's lap. Cao Pi said, [...] "What's going on, Madam Liu? Ask that lady <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> her head!" [...] Cao Pi was very impressed and entranced by Lady Zhen's beauty when he saw her. His father allowed him to marry her later. Another account of this incident stated that Lady Liu and Lady Zhen were in Yuan Shang's residence when Cao Pi entered. Lady Zhen's hair was dishevelled and she was crying behind her mother-in-law. When Cao Pi asked, Lady Liu told him the woman behind her was Yuan Xi's wife. Cao Pi was so entranced by Lady Zhen's beauty that he married her and treated her well. Yuan Xi was still alive at the time. Yuan Shang came to join him after his defeat by Cao Cao. In 207, Cao Cao defeated Yuan Xi, Yuan Shang and their Wuhuan allies at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain, after which they fled to Liaodong to join the warlord Gongsun Kang. Gongsun Kang feared that they would become a threat to him, so he lured them into a trap, executed them, and sent their heads to Cao Cao.|$|E
2500|$|Sackville-West worked tirelessly <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> Woolf's self-esteem, {{encouraging}} {{her not to}} view {{herself as}} a quasi-reclusive inclined to sickness who should hide herself away from the world, but rather offered praise for her liveliness and sense of wit, her health, her intelligence and achievements as a writer. Sackville-West led Woolf to reappraise herself, developing a more positive self-image, and the feeling that her writings were the products of her strengths rather than her weakness. Starting {{at the age of}} 15, Woolf had believed the diagnosis by her father and his doctor that reading and writing were deleterious to her nervous condition, requiring [...] a regime of physical labour such as gardening to prevent a total nervous collapse. This led Woolf to spend much time obsessively engaging in such physical labour. Sackville-West was the first to argue to Woolf she had been misdiagnosed, and that it was far better to engage in reading and writing to calm her nerves—advice that was taken. Under the influence of Sackville-West, Woolf learned to deal with her nervous aliments by switching between various forms of intellectual activities such as reading, writing and book reviews, instead of spending her time in physical activities that sapped her strength and worsened her nerves. Sackville-West chose the financially struggling Hogarth Press as her publisher in order to assist the Woolfs financially. Seducers in Ecuador, the first of the novels by Sackville-West published by Hogarth, was not a success, selling only 1500 copies in its first year, but the next Sackville-West novel they published, The Edwardians, was a bestseller that sold 30,000 copies in its first six months. Sackville-West's novels, though not typical of the Hogarth Press, saved Hogarth, taking them from the red into the black. However, Woolf was not always appreciative {{of the fact that it}} was Sackville-West's books that kept the Hogarth Press profitable, writing dismissively in 1933 of her [...] "servant girl" [...] novels. The financial security allowed by the good sales of Sackville-West's novels in turn allowed Woolf to engage in more experimental work, such as The Waves, as Woolf had to be cautious when she depended upon Hogarth entirely for her income.|$|E
