25|$|Gille Chlerig,1 also Gillocheri 2 or Gillocher, Gillocher or Gylocher is a Gaelic name attested {{only in a}} Latin source, a 13th-century forgery {{designed}} to {{advance the cause of}} Scottish independence. The name is highly corrupted, and therefore the name and meaning is unclear. Gille Chlerig is not known in any capacity other than being father of Morggán, but most scholars seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>comfortable</b> accepting him as the Mormaer of Earl of Mar who preceded his son Morggán.|$|E

25|$|Notice {{that this}} kinematical {{discussion}} does not {{delve into the}} mechanism by which the required forces are generated. That {{is the subject of}} kinetics. In the case of the carousel, the kinetic discussion would involve perhaps a study of the walker's shoes and the friction they need to generate against the floor of the carousel, or perhaps the dynamics of skateboarding, if the walker switched to travel by skateboard. Whatever the means of travel across the carousel, the forces calculated above must be realized. A very rough analogy is heating your house: you must have a certain temperature <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>comfortable,</b> but whether you heat by burning gas or by burning coal is another problem. Kinematics sets the thermostat, kinetics fires the furnace.|$|E
25|$|Beveridge was {{instrumental}} in compiling a new-look team where Shawn Redhage, Stephen Weigh and Brad Robbins were surrounded by proven NBL players Damian Martin, Drew Williamson, Luke Schenscher and Martin Cattalini, and rising stars Kevin Lisch and Jesse Wagstaff. Paul Rogers relinquished the captaincy heading into the 2009/10 season, handing over the reins to Redhage. The mix turned out to work remarkably well, with the late-season addition of Galen Young to replace the injured Paul Rogers proving the masterstroke that brought about a championship {{in the first year}} the group was together. After claiming the minor premiership and beating the Gold Coast Blaze in the Semi Finals, the Wildcats came up against the Wollongong Hawks in their first Grand Final series since 2003. After Games 1 and 2 proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>comfortable</b> victories for each home team, the Wildcats found themselves back inside The Jungle at Challenge Stadium for the deciding Game 3 in front of a capacity crowd. The Wildcats found themselves down by as many as 11 points in the second quarter, before an inspired Kevin Lisch exploded offensively to finish with 29 points to take the team to a record fifth NBL Championship with a 96–72 triumph, with Lisch taking home the Larry Sengstock Medal as MVP of the series.|$|E

25|$|Paris possessed an {{extraordinary}} number {{and variety of}} prisons, used for different classes of persons and types of crimes. The fortress of the Châtelet was the oldest royal prison, where {{the office of the}} Provost of Paris was also located. It had about fifteen large cells; the better cells were on the upper levels, where prisoners could pay a high pension <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>comfortable</b> and well-fed, while the lower cells, called de la Fosse, de la Gourdaine, du Puits and de l'Oubliette, were extremely damp and barely lit by the sun coming through a grate at street level. The Bastille and the Château de Vincennes were both used for high-ranking political prisoners, and had relatively luxurious conditions. The last three prisoners at the Chateau de Vincennes, the Marquis de Sade and two elderly and insane noblemen, were transferred to the Bastillle in 1784. The Bastille, begun in 1370, never held more than forty inmates; At the time of the Revolution, the Bastille had just seven prisoners; four counterfeiters, the two elderly noblemen, and a man named Tavernier, half-mad, accused of participation in an attempt to kill Louis XV thirty years earlier. Priests and other religious figures who committed crimes or other offenses were tried by church courts, and each priory and abbey had its own small prison. That of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pres was located at 166 boulevard Saint-Germain, and was a square building fifteen meters in diameter, with floors of small cells as deep as ten meters underground. The Abbey prison became a military prison under Louis XIV; in September 1792, it was the scene of a terrible massacre of prisoners, the prelude to the Reign of Terror.|$|E

He had visited the Irvin Air Chute Company while in the US during 1924 and recommended purchase at the time, but a backlog of orders for the RAF meant that the Australian equipment took almost two years to arrive. Flying Officer Ellis Wackett was assigned to instruct volunteers at RAAF Richmond, and made the country's first freefall descent from a military aircraft, an Airco DH.9, on 26May.

500|$|Chloe finally reveals to Clark in {{the season}} five premiere that she has known his secret, but that she wanted him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>comfortable</b> enough to tell her on his own.
