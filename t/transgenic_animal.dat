500|$|Research {{into the}} {{mechanism}} of HD has focused on identifying the functioning of HTT, how mHTT differs or interferes with it, and the brain pathology that the disease produces. Research is conducted using in vitro methods, animal models and human volunteers. Animal models are critical for understanding the fundamental mechanisms causing the disease and for supporting {{the early stages of}} drug development. Animals with chemically induced brain injury exhibit HD-like symptoms and were initially used, but they did not mimic the progressive features of the disease. [...] The identification of the causative gene has enabled the development of many <b>transgenic</b> <b>animal</b> models including nematode worms, Drosophila fruit flies, mice, rats, sheep, pigs and monkeys that express mutant huntingtin and develop progressive neurodegeneration and HD-like symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|However, anti-Aβ {{vaccines}} {{can promote}} antibody-mediated clearance of Aβ plaques in transgenic mice models with amyloid precursor proteins (APP), and can reduce cognitive impairments. Vaccines can stimulate {{the immune system}} to produce its own antibodies, in this case by introducing Aβ into <b>transgenic</b> <b>animal</b> models, known as active immunization. They can also introduce antibodies into animal models, known as passive immunization. In mice expressing APP, both active and passive immunization of anti-Aβ antibodies {{has been shown to}} be effective in clearing plaques, and can improve cognitive function.. Therefore, several clinical trials using passive and active immunization approaches by development of certain drugs approved by the FDA are currently underway, and are expected to yield results in a couple of years. The implementation of these drugs is during the onset of AD. Other research and drug development for early intervention and AD prevention is ongoing. Various drugs that are under research to treat AD include Bapineuzumab, Solanezumab, and Gautenerumab.|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{how people}} who handle <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals</b> in practice – laboratory workers {{and members of}} animal ethics committees – talk about and handle dilemmas with <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals.</b> It is shown how dilemmas associated with <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals</b> become back-grounded through rhetorical comparisons with “something else”. Through these comparisons, <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals</b> are framed as normal, ordinary and thereby unproblematic, on the one hand, and as exclusive treasures imbedded in hopes and expectations of future medical treatments, on the other. This tension builds up to a discourse on transgenic mice as ordinary treasures. Towards {{the end of the}} paper we discuss how this discourse tends to exclude possibilities of discussing specific dilemmas of genetically modified animals. Instead the discourse is contributing to certain transgenic silences. This paper is based on the project Dilemmas with <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals,</b> in which notions of culture and nature, risk and safety, innovation and organism, science and technology, are investigated in the scientific production, use and ethical evaluation of <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals.</b> The project builds on case studies in two different contexts; laboratories and animal ethics committees.

40|$|<b>Transgenic</b> <b>animals</b> play a {{large role}} in several {{critical}} industries: the pharmaceutical industry, the agricultural industry, farming, and medical research. As these biotechnology-oriented industries have grown, the United States and other industrialized nations have realized the importance of patent protection for genetically-engineered animals. Unfortunately, lesser-developed countries (LDCs), which can benefit the most from such industries, do not provide adequate patent protection for <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals,</b> even though patent protection for <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals</b> could ultimately lead to reduction in starvation and disease, two of the biggest problems facing many LDCs. The United States should pursue bilateral negotiations with developing countries in the area of animal patents to secure patent protection for <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals.</b> Because of their flexibility, bilateral agreements offer a better short-term solution than multilateral agreements. This comment first describes the methods for creating <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals</b> and the importance of these animals. Second, this article outlines the current state of animal patents in industrialized countries and the various controversies those countries have faced during the development of their current policies. Third, this article explains and refutes the arguments advanced by developing countries to support their lack of adequate patent protection for <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals.</b> Finally, this article shows that the best short-term solution to align the views of the industrialized countries with those of the various developing countries are bilateral agreements rather than multilateral agreements...|$|R

We have now characterized {{one of the}} transgenic lines as regards the tissue accumulation of the polyamines and the activities of their metabolizing enzymes. Among the tissues analysed, the polyamine pattern was most strikingly changed in testis and brain of the <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals.</b> ODC activity was greatly enhanced in all tissues, except kidney, of the <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals.</b> The most dramatic increase, 80 -fold, was found in brain of the transgenic mice.

However, past methods available to generate <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals,</b> such as pronuclear microinjection {{or the use of}} embryonic stem cells, have either been inefficient or not available in all animals, bovine included.

40|$|<b>Transgenic</b> <b>animals</b> are {{animals that}} are genetically altered to have traits that mimic {{symptoms}} of specific human pathologies. They provide genetic models of various human diseases which are important in understanding disease and developing new targets. In early 1980 Gordon and co-workers described the first gene addition experiment using the microinjection technology and since then the impact of transgenic technology on basic research has been significant. Within 20 years of its inception, ATryn the first drug approved by USFDA from <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals</b> was developed and it has opened door to drugs from <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals.</b> In addition, they are looked upon as potential future donors for xenotransplantation. With increasing knowledge about the genetics and improvements in the transgenetic technology numerous useful applications like biologically safe new-generation drugs based on human regulatory proteins are being developed. Various aspects of concern {{in the coming years}} are the regulatory guidelines, ethical issues and patents related to the use of <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals.</b> This modern medicine is on the threshold of a pharmacological revolution. Use of <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals</b> will provide solutions for drug research, xenotransplantation, clinical trials and will prove to be a new insight in drug development...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} {{generated a}} transgenic mouse line with activated polyamine catabolism due to overexpression of spermidine/spermine N 1 -acetyltransferase. Phenotypic changes in these animals included permanent loss of {{hair at the}} age of 3 [*]wk. We have now further explored development of hair loss during early postnatal life. The first hair cycle appeared to be completed normally in the <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals.</b> At postnatal day 15, although macroscopically indistinguishable from their syngenic littermates, the <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals</b> already showed microscopically signs of hair follicle degeneration. Wild-type mice started their second anagen phase at day 27, whereas the <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals</b> did not display functional hair follicles at that time. Hair follicles were replaced by dermal cysts and epidermal utriculi. Analysis of skin polyamines revealed that the <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals</b> continuously overaccumulated putrescine. The view that an overaccumulation of putrescine was related to the disturbed hair follicle development was strengthened by the finding that doubly transgenic mice overexpressing, both spermidine/spermine N 1 -acetyltransferase and ornithine decarboxylase and with extremely high levels of putrescine in the skin, showed distinctly more severe skin changes compared with the singly <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals.</b> Interest ingly, in spite of their hairless phenotype, the spermidine/spermine N 1 -acetyltransferase transgenic mice, were significantly more resistant to the development of papillomas in response to the two-stage skin carcinogenesis. Analysis of skin polyamines indicated that the syngenic mice tripled their spermidine content when exposed to promotion, whereas the <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals</b> showed only modest changes. These results suggest that putrescine plays a pivotal part in normal hair follicle development...|$|R

40|$|We {{recently}} {{generated a}} transgenic mouse line overexpressing spermidine/spermine N 1 -acetyltransferase (SSAT) gene {{under its own}} promoter. The tissue polyamine pools of these animals were profoundly affected and the mice were hairless from early age. We have now generated another transgenic-mouse line overexpressing the SSAT gene {{under the control of}} a heavy-metal-inducible mouse metallothionein I (MT) promoter. Even in the absence of heavy metals, changes in the tissue polyamine pools indicated that a marked activation of polyamine catabolism had occurred in the <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals.</b> As with the SSAT transgenic mice generated previously, the mice of the new line (MT-SSAT) suffered permanent hair loss, but this occurred considerably later than in the previous SSAT <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals.</b> Liver was the most affected tissue in the MT-SSAT <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals,</b> revealed by putrescine overaccumulation, significant decrease in spermidine concentration and > 90 % reduction in the spermine pool. Even though hepatic SSAT mRNA accumulated to massive levels in non-induced <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals,</b> SSAT activity was only moderately elevated. Administration of ZnSO 4 further elevated the level of hepatic SSAT message and induced enzyme activity, but not more than 2 - to 3 -fold. Treatment of the <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals</b> with the polyamine analogue N 1,N 11 -diethylnorspermine (DENSPM) resulted in an immense induction, more than 40000 -fold, of enzyme activity in the liver of <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals,</b> and minor changes in the SSAT mRNA level. Liver spermidine and spermine pools were virtually depleted within 1 - 2 days in response to the treatment with the analogue. The treatment also resulted in a marked mortality (up to 60 %) among the <b>transgenic</b> <b>animals</b> which showed ultrastructural changes in the liver, most notably mitochondrial swelling, one of the earliest signs of cell injury. These results indicated that, even without its own promoter, SSAT is powerfully induced by the polyamine analogue through a mechanism that appears to involve a direct translational and/or heterogenous nuclear RNA processing control. It is likewise significant that overexpression of SSAT renders the animals extremely sensitive to polyamine analogues...|$|R

50|$|Prior to the {{production}} of Polly and Molly, the only demonstrated way to make a <b>transgenic</b> <b>animal</b> was by microinjection of DNA into the pronuclei of fertilized oocytes (eggs).
