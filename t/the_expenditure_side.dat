I hope yours, my respected reader, are large; {{that there are many}} fine round sums of figures {{on each side of the}} page: liberal on <b>the</b> <b>expenditure</b> <b>side,</b> greater still on the receipt. I hope, sir, you will be [...] "a better man," [...] as they say, in '62 than in this moribund '61, whose career of life is just coming to its terminus. A better man in purse? in body? in soul's health? Amen, good sir, in all. Who is there so good in mind, body or estate, but bettering won't still be good for him? O unknown Fate, presiding over next year, if you will give me better health, a better appetite, a better digestion, a better income, a better temper in '62 than you have bestowed in '61, I think your servant will be the better for the changes. For instance, I should be the better for a new coat. This one, I acknowledge, is very old. The family says so. My good friend, who amongst us would not be the better if he would give up some old habits? Yes, yes. You agree with me. You take the allegory? Alas! at our time of life we don't like to give up those old habits, do we? It is ill to change. There is the good old loose, easy, slovenly bedgown, laziness, for example. What man of sense likes to fling it off and put on a tight guinde prim dress-coat that pinches him? There is the cozy wraprascal, self-indulgence--how easy it is! How warm! How it always seems to fit! You can walk out in it; you can go down to dinner in it. You can say of such what Tully says of his books: Pernoctat nobiscum, peregrinatur, rusticatur. It is a little slatternly--it is a good deal stained--it isn't becoming--it smells of cigar-smoke; but, allons donc! let the world call me idle and sloven. I love my ease better than my neighbor's opinion. I live to please myself; not you, Mr. Dandy, with your supercilious airs. I am a philosopher. Perhaps I live in my tub, and don't make any other use of it--. We won't pursue further this unsavory metaphor; but, with regard to some of your old habits let us say-- ...|$|E

40|$|Continuous {{monitoring}} {{of the evolution of}} the economy is fundamental for the decisions of public and private decision makers. The paper proposes EUROMIND, which is a new monthly indicator of the euro area economic conditions, based on tracking real gross domestic product monthly, relying on information provided in the Eurostat Euro-IND database. EUROMIND has several original economic and statistical features. First, it considers both the output and <b>the</b> <b>expenditure</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> economy, as it provides a monthly estimate of the value added of the six branches of economic activity and of the main gross domestic product components by type of expenditure (final consumption, gross capital formation and net exports), and combines the estimates with optimal weights reflecting their relative precision. Second, the indicator is based on information at both the monthly and the quarterly level, modelled with a dynamic factor specification cast in state space form. Third, since estimation of the multivariate dynamic factor model with mixed frequency data can be numerically complex, computational efficiency is achieved by implementing univariate filtering and smoothing procedures. Finally, special attention is paid to chain linking and its implications, via a multistep procedure that exploits the additivity of the volume measures expressed at the prices of the previous year...|$|R
50|$|Hungary is an OECD high-income {{mixed economy}} {{with a very}} high human {{development}} index and a skilled labour force, with the 13th lowest income inequality in the world; furthermore it is the 14th most complex economy according to the Economic Complexity Index.

40|$|If {{official}} figures overstated {{the growth}} of banking output in the UK in the recent boom, {{does this mean that}} GDP growth was overstated too? The answer is no. It is truer to say that if banking output was overstated then the output of some other industry or industries must have been understated, leaving GDP relatively unaffected. The reason is that the Office for National Statistics measures the real growth of GDP primarily from <b>the</b> <b>expenditure</b> <b>side.</b> And from <b>the</b> <b>expenditure</b> <b>side</b> most of the problematic part of banking output drops out since it constitutes intermediate consumption not final expenditure. Consequently, the effect of any mis-measurement of banking output on GDP growth in the boom of 2000 - 2007 is likely to have been small: GDP growth might have been overstated by about 0. 1 % p. a...|$|E

40|$|The {{existing}} fiscal equalization {{program in}} Canada attempts to equalize {{per capita tax}} burden alone and completely ignores <b>the</b> <b>expenditure</b> <b>side.</b> This paper examines {{the consequences of this}} neglect both conceptually as well as empirically. The paper concludes that a program of equalization that ignores <b>the</b> <b>expenditure</b> <b>side</b> cannot be defended on economic efficiency and equity grounds. Further, such a program might not be consistent with the constituional intent of equalization in Canada. The paper argues that the present system of equalization in Canada could be improved by explicitly recognizing relative expenditure needs of the Canadian provinces in the formula. The paper implements an objective methodology for measuring these needs and provides tentative calculations based on the proposed approach. The paper concludes that a fiscal needs based program of equalization would differ greatly from the present program in terms of its redistributive impact and further that under such a program the tota amount of equalization transfers made by the Federal Government might also be reduced. ...|$|E
