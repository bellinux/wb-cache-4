5|$|About a {{month before}} <b>the</b> <b>race</b> took place, in February 2015, <b>the</b> <b>race</b> organisers {{published}} a publicity poster for <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> This poster showed a woman, with her dress raised and underwear with <b>the</b> <b>race</b> logo visible. A cyclist's gloved hand was reaching out apparently to pinch the woman's bottom. The poster bore the caption Wie knijpt ze in Harelbeke? ("Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?"). This was a reference to Peter Sagan's actions after the 2013 Tour of Flanders, when he pinched the bottom of Maja Leye during the podium ceremony after <b>the</b> <b>race.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jeff Gordon won {{the pole}} position, {{although}} he was almost immediately passed by Kasey Kahne {{at the start of}} <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> Many Chase for the Sprint Cup participants, including Jimmie Johnson and Carl Edwards encountered problems during <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> Kyle Busch was leading <b>the</b> <b>race</b> with three laps remaining but ran out of fuel, giving the lead, and the win, to Kurt Busch.

5|$|After having {{held off}} {{for most of}} <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> the rain began to fall once more during the final three hours. This caused {{numerous}} incidents, including the No. 93 Autorlando Porsche missing a Mulsanne chicane and plowing through a temporary tire barrier. The No. 7 Peugeot made an unscheduled garage stop and retired one lap after re-entering <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> claiming oil pressure problems.|$|E
5|$|After the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix was cancelled, <b>the</b> <b>race</b> was {{reinstated}} for the 2012 {{season with}} a provisional date in October. The {{final version of the}} calendar brought <b>the</b> <b>race</b> forward to April.|$|E

5000|$|At {{college campuses}} during the 1960s, some people {{demonstrated}} for world peace by carrying a Flag of <b>the</b> <b>Races</b> (also called <b>the</b> Flag of <b>the</b> Human <b>Race)</b> with five horizontal stripes (from {{top to bottom}} they were red, black, brown, yellow, and white, representing respectively <b>the</b> American Indian <b>race,</b> <b>the</b> [...] Sub-Saharan <b>race,</b> <b>the</b> Malayan <b>race,</b> <b>the</b> Mongolian <b>race,</b> and <b>the</b> Caucasian <b>race).</b> Gilbert Baker {{is said to have}} gotten the idea for the rainbow flag from this flag.The early flag of the Republic of China also featured five stripes standing for five ethnicities.|$|R
5|$|All {{seventeen}} UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited {{and were}} obliged to attend <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> In January 2015, five UCI Professional Continental teams were given wildcard places into <b>the</b> <b>race</b> by <b>the</b> <b>race</b> organisers– Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) – to complete the 22-team peloton. Among the wildcard teams was , the first African trade team {{to participate in the}} Tour. As each team was entitled to enter nine riders, the peloton on the first stage consisted of 198 riders. These came from 32 countries. 41 riders – approximately a fifth of the peloton – were French; no other nation had more than 20 riders in <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> Merhawi Kudus and Daniel Teklehaimanot were the first ever Eritrean riders to participate in the Tour.|$|E
5|$|Alonso {{held off}} Vettel to {{maintain}} his start line advantage on the first lap. Lewis Hamilton, who started third, fought off teammate Jenson Button to retain his start position. The top two remained the same through {{the first and only}} round of pit stops. Webber's team, Red Bull, opted to pit him early allowing him to move ahead of Hamilton. <b>The</b> <b>race</b> was neutralised by the deployment of the safety car after Kamui Kobayashi and Bruno Senna crashed on lap 31. Hamilton retired after a collision with Webber shortly after <b>the</b> <b>race</b> restarted on lap 36. Alonso maintained his lead throughout the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>race</b> despite pressure from Vettel.|$|E
5|$|As in 1906, <b>the</b> <b>race</b> {{was decided}} by a points system. At {{the end of}} every stage, the winner was given one point, the next cyclist two points, and so on. After the eighth stage, when there were only 49 cyclists left in <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> the points given in the first eight stages were redistributed among the {{remaining}} cyclists, according to their positions in those stages.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Racing</b> Drones were {{originally}} {{built by the}} Accelerons as test drivers. These robots became a problem as they {{would do anything to}} win. <b>The</b> <b>Racing</b> Drones were abandoned on Earth when the Accelerons returned to their home world. Gelorum, their leader, ruled with an iron fist as she had no concern for life - robotic or organic. Now that <b>the</b> <b>Racing</b> Realms are open, <b>the</b> <b>Racing</b> Drones are free to enter and win AcceleChargers. <b>The</b> <b>Racing</b> Drones excel in manufacturing, building drivers and vehicles in mass quantities and to the required specifications. They also have the ability to reproduce and send AcceleCharger powers to drivers in need.|$|R
5|$|At {{the opening}} round in Australia, an error in {{qualifying}} left him in 10th on the grid {{for the start of}} <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> On the second lap of <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> Webber crashed with Heikki Kovalainen, Adrian Sutil and Nick Heidfeld following their efforts to avoid a collision with Rubens Barrichello, causing all except Barrichello to pit.|$|E
5|$|Austria's Alexander Wurz {{drove through}} the field in his Williams from 19th at the start to finish third by taking one pitstop, {{completing}} 40 laps on super soft tires.

5|$|Avuis Adrian R.

50|$|Meetings {{are usually}} {{made up of}} three 20-minute <b>races.</b> <b>The</b> grid for <b>the</b> first <b>race</b> is {{determined}} by a 20-minute qualifying session. The results of <b>the</b> first <b>race</b> forms <b>the</b> grid for <b>the</b> second <b>race.</b> <b>The</b> grid for <b>the</b> third <b>race</b> is decided by reversing between 4 and 6 of the top 10 finishers from <b>the</b> second <b>race.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>races</b> {{were not}} completed, no headships were awarded. When <b>the</b> <b>races</b> were cancelled, Emmanuel men and Jesus women were in 1st position.|$|R
5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>race</b> started, 78 riders {{had signed}} up for <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> Eighteen of those did not start <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> so the Tour began with 60 riders, {{including}} former winner Henri Cornet and future winners René Pottier and Lucien Petit-Breton. The riders were not grouped in teams, {{but most of them}} rode with an individual sponsor. Two of the cyclists—Catteau and Lootens—were Belgian, all other cyclists were French. Leading up {{to the start of the}} Tour, Wattelier, Trousselier, Pottier and Augereau were all considered the most likely contenders to win the event.|$|E
5|$|Borgarello won {{his second}} stage with his {{victory in the}} seventh stage, out-sprinting Micheletto and Carlo Durando. In the final sprint, Micheletto felt that Durando encroached him and moved ahead; this action caused the Italian fans to rush on to the track in anger. The police then moved the two riders to a bar, until the crowd dispersed. Micheletto won his second stage of <b>the</b> <b>race</b> two days later. Before {{the start of the}} final stage, Micheletto became sick and Pavesi {{convinced}} him to continue <b>the</b> <b>race</b> and finish the final stage. Borgarello won his third stage of <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> while Atala-Dunlop consolidated their lead and <b>the</b> <b>race</b> win by having two riders, Micheletto and Galetti, finish in the top four.|$|E
5|$|Brad Keselowski won {{the pole}} position, {{although}} he was almost immediately passed by Tony Stewart {{at the start of}} <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> Many Chase for the Sprint Cup participants, including Jimmie Johnson, Kurt Busch, and Hamlin, were in the top ten for most of <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> although some encountered problems in the closing laps. Stewart was leading <b>the</b> <b>race</b> with two laps remaining but ran out of fuel, giving the lead, and the win, to Bowyer.
