5|$|The {{very last}} {{act of the}} American Civil War was when Captain Waddell walked up {{the steps of the}} town hall in November 1865 with a letter <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mayor {{surrendering}} his vessel, the CSS Shenandoah, to the British government.|$|E
5|$|In 1543, several {{conservative}} clergymen in Kent {{banded together}} to attack and denounce two reformers, Richard Turner and John Bland, before the Privy Council. They prepared articles <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Council, {{but at the last}} moment, additional denunciations were added by Stephen Gardiner's nephew, Germain Gardiner. These new articles attacked Cranmer and listed his misdeeds back to 1541. This document and the actions that followed were the basis of the so-called Prebendaries' Plot. The articles were delivered to the Council in London and were probably read on 22 April 1543. The king most likely saw the articles against Cranmer that night. The archbishop, however, appeared unaware that an attack on his person was made. His commissioners in Lambeth dealt specifically with Turner's case where he was acquitted, much to the fury of the conservatives.|$|E
5|$|The Sejm had {{the right}} to vote on civil, {{administrative}} and legal issues; a simple majority was required to pass laws. With permission from the king, it could vote on matters related to the fiscal system and the military. It {{had the right}} to control government officials, and could prepare reviews and reports on them <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king. It had legislative competences in court and administrative law. It could issue laws on currency, taxation and budget, deal with issues related to military conscription (such as its size), and amend the constitution. It had no legislative initiative, as that belong only to the king; however, the Sejm could issue petitions to the monarch with proposed legislation.|$|E
50|$|Articles 68 to 77 {{specified}} how {{legislation is}} to be passed into law. Laws could be proposed {{by a member of}} the Reichstag or by the Reich government and were passed on the majority vote of the Reichstag. Proposed legislation had <b>to</b> be <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Reichsrat, and the latter body's objections were required <b>to</b> be <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Reichstag.|$|R

5|$|Since Yellowstone {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous {{national}} parks in the world, news coverage was extensive and sometimes sensational. Federal officials sometimes had only limited information <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media. The National Park Service received some 3,000 media requests, not all of which the two park public information officers were able to grant, even with the assistance of a staff of over 40 employees. 16 more park personnel were assigned the role of liaisons with the media where fire fighting manpower was concentrated. By the time the fires were under control in mid-November, the park was still receiving 40 to 70 media requests daily. Media coverage of the fires brought the National Park Service more national attention than it had ever received, and the 1988 fire season has been called one of the most important events in the history of that agency.|$|E
25|$|Each year, the Niño Dios of the {{household}} is brought to Mass on 2 February to be blessed. After the mass, the family returns home to celebrate, typically with tamales, buñuelos, atole and hot chocolate. The tradition recalls that forty days after Jesus’s birth, Mary and Joseph took the child to the Temple <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> priests.|$|E
25|$|Organized {{nationalist}} sentiment among Tunisians, driven underground by the French {{following the}} popular demonstrations in 1912, resurfaced after the Great War. Traveling to Paris Abdel Aziz Tha'alibi sought <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Versailles Peace Conference Tunisia's {{case against the}} Protectorate. He also published his book La Tunisie martyre which, among other things, endorsed a constitutional program based on the 1861 precedent.|$|E

40|$|Wound {{management}} in burns is a potentially complex issue. Salivary constituents {{have been shown}} experimentally to be of benefit {{in the treatment of}} thermal injuries. In our clinical experience we have encountered patients who have saliva directly applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> burn wound prior <b>to</b> <b>presenting</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> national burns service. The practice is known as "Licking". We report two cases <b>to</b> illustrate <b>the</b> presentations we have encountered.

25|$|CSS Shenandoah {{had struck}} her colors twice. This marked the last {{surrender}} of the American Civil War {{and the last}} official lowering of the Confederate flag. The very last act of the Civil War was Captain Waddell walking up the steps of Liverpool Town Hall with a letter <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mayor surrendering his vessel to the British government. In so doing, the Shenandoah became the only Confederate warship to circumnavigate the globe.|$|E
25|$|The {{tasks of}} the faculty members at Preuss extend beyond teaching. On Fridays, the {{teachers}} meet for twohours to discuss staff development, trends in education, and student work, and each teacher creates an annual portfolio <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest {{of the faculty}} {{at the end of}} the year. As a charter school, Preuss is a non-union shop. Instead, it signs one-year contracts with its faculty members and does not grant tenure.|$|E
25|$|In early June 2011, {{in advance}} of the report that Wuerl was due <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States Conference of Catholic Bishops on {{interest}} shown in joining an ordinariate, a 100-member Episcopal parish in Bladensburg, Maryland was reported to have become the first in the United States to ask to be received into the Catholic Church while keeping aspects of its Anglican traditions. Other accounts give Mount Calvary Church in Baltimore as the first, and the Bladensburg church as the second.|$|E

50|$|Foreign influence, which {{secretly}} {{fueled the}} already existing internal opposition, ensured the Code was initially postponed (it was first <b>to</b> be <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sejm in 1778) and then defeated during the Sejm in 1780.|$|R
25|$|Webster also {{advocated}} {{the establishment of}} commercial relations with Japan, {{going so far as}} <b>to</b> draft <b>the</b> letter that was <b>to</b> be <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Emperor Kōmei on President Fillmore's behalf by Commodore Matthew Perry on his 1852 voyage to Asia.|$|R
25|$|Due to his {{intellectual}} abilities and patriotism {{he was elected}} to the national assembly as secretary with nine other Romanians. On October 20, 1848, he signed, along with August Treboniu Laurian, Simion Bărnuțiu, Timotei Cipariu, Nicolae Bălăşescu and Florian Micăş, the manifest to the Romanians. He was also elected to be a member of the Romanian delegation to go to Vienna <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Emperor of Austria the wishes of the Romanians in Transylvania. He then continued to militate for the national rights of the Romanians in Transylvania after 1849.|$|E
25|$|The parish {{had its own}} bailiffs, burgesses and seal, {{distinct}} from those of Shrewsbury itself. However, Shrewsbury's renewed municipal charter of 1586 brought Holy Cross parish under its civic authority. Until the Dissolution, the right <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vicarage, or advowson, belonged to the Abbot and convent of Shrewsbury Abbey. Then it passed to the Crown. However, in 1797, legislation was passed to transfer the advowson to Thomas Noel Hill, 2nd Baron Berwick of Attingham Park, {{in exchange for the}} patronage of some parishes he held in Suffolk.|$|E
25|$|On 16 November 1848, a {{crowd of}} revolutionaries moved to the Quirinal and the Parliament <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pope their demands, {{especially}} war against Austria. The Pope reportedly replied, his dignity as head of state and of the Church does not permit him to fulfil conditions of rebels. Following this, the Quirinal was covered by cannon fire, which caused several deaths. After that, to save lives, the Pope agreed {{to a list of}} proposed ministers, although stating that he would abstain from any cooperation with them.|$|E
25|$|In 1816 Salsette escorted {{a convoy}} back to Britain. On 12 May, Salsette stopped at St Helena en route, which gave Bowen <b>the</b> {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> be <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Emperor Napoleon. She arrived in Plymouth in June 1816 to pay off.|$|R
50|$|Aware that {{it would}} take time to either {{construct}} or purchase ships from overseas, Donker Curtius asked for one of the warships of the Royal Netherlands Navy stationed in the Netherlands East Indies <b>to</b> be <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Japanese government.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the group}} focused on {{working with the}} {{financial}} proposals which they expected <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> organization that oversees the Games: the Central American and Caribbean Sports Organization (CASCO) in January 2009. By this point, the committee was planning meetings with popular representatives and had received moral support from the government. On 30 January 2009, CASCO gave the local organizers committee for the Games 60 days to get an estimated $20 million budget for the Games, or risk losing the hosting rights. The funds for the event were officially secured on 19 March 2009.|$|E
25|$|To that end, Mayor Raymond Tucker {{obtained}} {{grants to}} fund a study of consolidation, which found that most county and city residents would not support full consolidation but would support partial consolidation of certain agencies, such as mass transit, zoning, and property assessment. The Board of Freeholders that met to discuss consolidation selected the study's recommendations <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> voters, opting out of a full city-county merger. Although most major business groups, unions, and Cervantes supported the proposal, Mayor Tucker refused to endorse it, claiming it was inadequate. Anti-tax arguments against {{the creation of a}} new government district also were effective, and both city and county voters rejected it overwhelmingly.|$|E
25|$|Around 1927, Scott {{developed}} {{an interest in}} acting and decided {{to make his way}} to Los Angeles and seek a career in the motion picture industry. Fortunately, Scott's father had become acquainted with Howard Hughes and provided a letter of introduction for his son <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eccentric millionaire filmmaker. Hughes responded by getting Scott a small part in a George O'Brien film called Sharp Shooters (1928). Despite its title and the presence of O'Brien, Sharp Shooters is not a western, as some film historians claimed. Rather, it's a romantic comedy. A print of the film survives in the UCLA Film and Television Archive.|$|E
50|$|Floats are {{decorated}} platforms, which are either {{built on a}} vehicle or towed behind one.

25|$|Flower {{was also}} a leading {{authority}} on the arrangement of museums. He insisted {{on the importance of}} distinguishing between collections intended for the use of specialists and those designed for the instruction of the general public, pointing out that it was as futile <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> former a number of merely typical forms as to provide the latter with a long series of specimens differing only in the most minute details. His ideas, which were largely and successfully applied to the museums of which he had charge, gained wide approval, and their influence entitles him to be looked upon as a reformer who did much to improve the methods of museum arrangement and management.|$|E
25|$|In August 2000, Shayler voluntarily {{returned}} to the UK on condition he was not remanded in custody pending his trial. He was arrested and subsequently released on bail. He was charged with three counts of breaching the Official Secrets Act 1989 on 21 September 2000, one charge of passing on information acquired from a telephone tap (a breach of Section Four of the Act), and two others of passing on information and documents obtained {{by virtue of his}} membership of the service (a breach of Section One of the Act). The judge at the trial was Mr Justice Moses. At pre-trial hearings he ruled that Shayler had to disclose all information and argument he intended <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jury to the judge and prosecution beforehand.|$|E
25|$|Yum-Yum {{is being}} {{prepared}} by her friends for her wedding ("Braid the raven hair"), after which she muses {{on her own}} beauty ("The sun whose rays"). Pitti-Sing and Peep-Bo return to remind her of the limited duration of her impending union. Joined by Nanki-Poo and Pish-Tush, they try to keep their spirits up ("Brightly dawns our wedding-day"), but soon Ko-Ko and Pooh-Bah enter to inform them of a twist in the law that states that when a married man is beheaded for flirting, his wife must be buried alive ("Here's a how-de-do"). Yum-Yum is unwilling to marry under these circumstances, and so Nanki-Poo challenges Ko-Ko to behead him on the spot. It turns out, however, that Ko-Ko has never executed anyone, not even a Blue bottle, and cannot execute Nanki-Poo, because the ex-tailor is too soft-hearted. Ko-Ko instead sends Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum away to be wed (by Pooh-Bah, as Archbishop of Titipu), promising <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mikado a false affidavit in evidence of the fictitious execution.|$|E
