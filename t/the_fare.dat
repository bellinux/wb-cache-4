5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>fare</b> {{system has}} been {{integrated}} by TransitLink, commuters need to pay only one fare and pass through two fare gates (once on entry, once on exit) for an entire journey for most interchange stations, even when transferring between lines operated by different companies. Commuters can choose to extend a trip mid-journey, and pay the difference when they exit their destination station.|$|E
5|$|Fares are {{enforced}} by the station agent, who monitors activity at <b>the</b> <b>fare</b> gates adjacent {{to the window and}} at other fare gates through closed circuit television and faregate status screens located in the agent's booth. All stations are staffed with at least one agent at all times.|$|E

5|$|Proposals {{to simplify}} <b>the</b> <b>fare</b> {{structure}} abound. A flat fare that disregards distance has been proposed, or simpler fare bands or zones. Either scheme would shift the fare-box recovery burden {{to the urban}} riders in San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley and away from suburban riders in East Contra Costa, Southern Alameda, and San Mateo Counties, where density is lowest, and consequently, operational cost is highest.|$|E
5|$|Riders {{enter and}} exit the system using a stored-value {{card in the}} form of a {{proximity}} card known as SmarTrip. <b>The</b> <b>fare</b> is deducted from the balance of the card when exiting.

5|$|Riders pay {{a single}} fare {{to enter the}} subway system and may {{transfer}} between trains {{at no extra cost}} until they exit via station turnstiles; <b>the</b> <b>fare</b> is a flat rate regardless of how far or how long the rider travels. Thus, riders must swipe their MetroCard upon entering the subway system, but not a second time upon leaving.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} tracks and two side {{platforms}} here. In between the local tracks and the express tracks, there are trackway walls. The station {{has a full}} length mezzanine, but as <b>the</b> <b>fare</b> control and booth area {{are at the center}} of the mezzanine, crossover is available only at the easternmost staircase.|$|E
5|$|A Standard Ticket {{contactless}} {{smart card}} for single or return journeys {{may also be purchased}} at the GTM for the payment of MRT and/or LRT fares. A S$0.10 deposit will be levied on top of <b>the</b> <b>fare</b> to be paid. The deposit will be automatically refunded through an offset of <b>the</b> <b>fare</b> to be paid for the third journey on the same ticket while an additional discount of S$0.10 will be given for the sixth journey on the same ticket. No refund of the deposit is provided if the card is used for fewer than 3 journeys. The ticket can be used for the purchase of single or return journeys to and from pre-selected stations up to a maximum of six journeys over 30 days. Fares for the Standard Ticket are always higher than those charged for the stored-valued CEPAS (EZ-Link and NETS FlashPay) cards for the same distance traveled. The ticket is retained by the user after each journey and {{does not need to be}} returned to any GTM or Passenger Service Centre. Identical to the usage of CEPAS cards, the ticket is tapped onto the faregate reader upon entry and exit.|$|E

5|$|From the Lexington Avenue entrance, {{there are}} two short {{escalators}} and a stair from the northwest corner, a staircase from the southwest corner, and a short elevator hidden {{around the corner from}} the escalators. From <b>the</b> <b>fare</b> control, {{there are two}} long escalators and a stair to an intermediate level, and then two shorter escalators and a pair of stairs to a lower mezzanine. Here, the bank splits and there are two separate tubes of two escalators and a stair each to each platform. The platform elevator has its own two turnstiles, and makes three stops (mezzanine, upper platform, lower platform).|$|E
5|$|In Boston, an {{undercover}} cop {{waits for the}} subway, alone. Suddenly, a suspicious man appears, jumping <b>the</b> <b>fare</b> barrier. Eventually, they both get onto a train and the police officer draws his gun as the man starts to walk towards him from behind. Suddenly, the subway comes to a screeching halt, flashes of light are seen, and the train loses power. Later, when the train is back up and running, a batch of commuters enter the subway car and find the undercover cop with the flesh on half his face and his left arm stripped down to the bone.|$|E
5|$|Many {{stations}} in the subway system have mezzanines. Mezzanines allow for passengers to enter from multiple locations at an intersection and proceed to the correct platform without having {{to cross the street}} before entering. Inside mezzanines are fare control areas, where passengers physically pay their fare to enter the subway system. In many older stations, <b>the</b> <b>fare</b> control area is at platform level with no mezzanine crossovers. Many elevated stations also have platform-level fare control with no common station house between directions of service.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{original}} financing {{plan called for}} a 50-cent toll increase on the Dulles Toll Road to finance the Silver Line (25 cents at the main plaza and 25 cents at the ramp plazas), the increase in projected costs resulted in the MWAA Board approving {{an increase in the}} surcharges. Effective January 1, 2010, <b>the</b> <b>fare</b> surcharge was increased to 50 cents at both the main plaza and ramp plazas, with additional 25-cent increases in main-plaza tolls set for 2011 and 2012. These toll surcharges are designed to support MWAA's 52.6% share of the projected $5.25 billion combined cost of Phase I and Phase II. MWAA has justified these toll increases as necessary to meet an estimated $220 million in annual debt-service costs projected by 2020. These toll revenue requirements were {{based on the assumption that}} the federal government, although it contributed $900 million to Phase I, would not contribute funds for Phase II.|$|E
5|$|Currently under {{construction}} are dedicated lanes for bus services which will operate {{as part of}} the new urban rapid transit network (bus rapid transit). The system includes high-quality stations and stops; express buses that can carry more than 120 passengers and will run on a three-minute frequency during peak hours along Amman's busiest corridors; terminals and park-n-ride facilities; and an integrated fare collection system allowing passengers to pay <b>the</b> <b>fare</b> at stations before embarking on the bus. The BRT is planned to run along three major corridors. The first one connects Sweileh with Mahatta via Sport City, with a major underground station at the University of Jordan. The second corridor connects Sport City with Downtown Amman at Ras El-Ain. The third corridor connects Customs Square with Mahatta.|$|E
5|$|Each {{platform}} has two same-level fare control areas, one {{at either}} end of the station, and there are no crossovers or crossunders. The full-time ones are at the north end and each has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The ones on the Manhattan-bound platform go up to the northeast and southeast corners of Bergen and Smith Streets while those on the Coney Island-bound platform go up to the northwest and southwest corners. <b>The</b> <b>fare</b> control areas on the south end of the platforms are unstaffed, containing full height turnstiles and one street stair to the northeast corner of Warren and Smith Streets on the Manhattan-bound platform and the northwest corner for the Coney Island-bound platform. The south fare control area is more heavily used.|$|E
50|$|The TMT {{have several}} {{different}} options to pay <b>the</b> <b>fares</b> for <b>the</b> bus. <b>The</b> <b>fares</b> {{vary depending on}} the type.

30|$|The lowest costs (and <b>the</b> cost-meeting <b>fares)</b> in <b>the</b> figure, in {{the case}} of 216 {{services}} per day, are € 0, 30 {{in the case}} of solid soil along the whole route, € 0, 36 {{in the case of}} 50 % solid soil and 50 % weak soil, and € 0, 40 in the case of 50 % solid soil, 40 % weak soil, and 10 % tunnel. A comparison with <b>the</b> <b>fares</b> of alternative modes is difficult because there is generally a wide range of <b>fares</b> for <b>the</b> same route because of revenue management. Based on the experiences of De Decker [33], <b>the</b> most common <b>fares</b> for high-speed trains would be between € 0, 15 and € 0, 25 per km, and those for conventional long-distance trains about half <b>the</b> HSR <b>fares.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fares</b> for low-cost airlines are also significantly lower than <b>the</b> HSR <b>fares.</b>|$|R
