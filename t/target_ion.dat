50|$|Ion {{implantation}} is low-temperature {{process by}} which ions of one element are accelerated into a solid target, thereby changing the physical, chemical, or electrical properties of the <b>target.</b> <b>Ion</b> implantation is used in semiconductor device fabrication and in metal finishing, {{as well as in}} materials science research. The ions can alter the elemental composition of the target (if the ions differ in composition from the target) if they stop and remain in the <b>target.</b> <b>Ion</b> implantation cause also chemical and physical changes when the ions impinge on the target at high energy. The crystal structure of the target can be damaged or even destroyed by the energetic collision cascades, and ions of sufficiently high energy (10s of MeV) can cause nuclear transmutation.|$|E

Indeed, modulation of host cell ion channel activity by viral proteins is being increasingly identified as an important virus-host interaction. Recent examples have demonstrated that virion entry, virus-egress {{and the maintenance of}} a cellular environment conducive to virus persistence are in part, dependent on virus manipulation of ion channel activity. Most excitingly, evidence has emerged that <b>targeting</b> <b>ion</b> channels pharmacologically can impede virus lifecycles.

50|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} caused by a defect in copper {{metabolism}} which results in accumulation of copper metal in various organs of the body. The <b>target</b> <b>ion</b> in this case is divalent, Cu2+. This ion is classified as borderline in the scheme of Ahrland, Chatt and Davies. This means that it forms roughly equally strong complexes with ligands whose donor atoms are N, O or F as with ligands whose donor atoms are P, S or Cl. Penicillamine, which contains nitrogen and sulphur donor atoms, is used as this type of ligand binds more strongly to copper ions than to calcium and magnesium ions.|$|E
50|$|Assassin bugs, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} kissing bugs, {{are one of}} the largest and morphologically diverse families of true bugs feeding on crickets, caterpillars and other insects. Some assassin bug species are bloodsucking parasites of mammals, even feed on humans. They can be commonly found throughout most of the world and their size varies from a few millimeters to as much as 3 or 4 centimeters. The toxic saliva of the predatory assassin bugs contains a complex mixture of small and large peptides for diverse uses such as immobilizing and pre-digesting their prey, as well as defense against competitors and predators. Assassin bug toxins are small peptides with disulfide connectivity that <b>target</b> <b>ion</b> channels. They are relatively homologous to the calcium channel blockers omega-conotoxins from marine cone snails and belong to the four-loop cysteine scaffold structural class.|$|E
50|$|The protein {{structure}} of crotamine {{could not be}} initially determined through protein crystallization nor X-ray diffraction. It was speculated that the difficulty was because crotamine has so many isoforms, leading {{to the formation of}} aggregates and different possible conformations of the protein. The structure and the shape of the protein was proposed through a 3D model generated by Siqueira et al. (2002) based on computational calculations that were supported with intensive molecular dynamics simulations and homology modeling procedures. Afterwards, Nicastro et al. (2003) discovered the structure of crotamine through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Crotamine has a topology that was never before seen in active toxins that <b>target</b> <b>ion</b> channels; the protein is composed of a short N-terminal alpha helix, a type of protein formation, and a small antiparallel triple-stranded beta-sheet, another type of protein formation, arranged in an ab1b2b3 topology. Crotamine has similar structural fold conformations to the human b-defensin family as well as identical disulfide bridges arrangement.|$|E

5000|$|An Ion-beam {{shepherd}} (IBS) is {{a concept}} in which the orbit and/or attitude of a spacecraft or a generic orbiting body is modified by having a beam of quasi-neutral plasma impinging against its surface to create a force and/or a torque on the <b>target.</b> <b>Ion</b> and plasma thrusters commonly used to propel spacecraft can be employed to produce a collimated plasma/ion beam and point it towards the body.The fact that the beam can be generated on a [...] "shepherd" [...] spacecraft placed in proximity of the target without physical attachment with the latter provides an interesting solution for space applications such as space debris removal, asteroid deflection and space transportation in general.

50|$|It was {{initially}} hypothesized that general anaesthetic binds to its <b>target</b> <b>ion</b> channel by a key-lock mechanism and changes its structure dramatically from open to closed conformation or vice versa. However, {{there is a}} significant amount of evidence against direct key-lock interaction of membrane proteins with general anaesthetics Various studies have shown that low affinity drugs including inhaled general anaesthetics do not usually interact with their target proteins via specific lock-and-key binding mechanism because they do not change molecular structures of transmembrane receptors, ion channels and globular proteins. Based on these experimental facts and some computer simulations modern version of protein hypothesis was proposed. Proteins of four-α-helix bundle structural motif served as models of monomer of pentameric Cys-loop receptor because binding pockets of inhaled anaesthetics are believed to be within transmembrane four-α-helix bundles of Cys-loop receptors. Inhaled general anaesthetic does not change structure of membrane channel but changes its dynamics especially dynamics in the flexible loops that connect α-helices in a bundle and are exposed to the membrane-water interface. It is a well known fact that dynamics of protein in microsecond-millisecond timescale is often coupled with functions of the protein. Thus it was logical to propose that since inhaled general anaesthetics do not change protein structure they may exert their effect on proteins by modulating protein dynamics in a slow microsecond-millisecond timescale and/or by disrupting the modes of motion essential for function of this protein. Normal interactions between residues in protein regions (loops) at the water-lipid interface that play critical roles in protein functions and agonist binding may be disrupted by general anaesthetic. Interactions within the same loop or between different loops may be disrupted by anaesthetics and ultimately functions of Cys-loop receptors may be altered.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Due to the {{increasing}} industrial use of titanium compounds, its determination {{is the subject of}} considerable efforts. The ionophore or membrane active recognition is the most important component of any polymeric membrane sensor. The sensor’s response depends on the ionophore and bonding between the ionophore and the <b>target</b> <b>ion.</b> Ionophores with molecule-sized dimensions containing cavities or semi-cavities can surround the <b>target</b> <b>ion.</b> The bond between the ionophore and <b>target</b> <b>ion</b> gives different selectivity and sensitivity toward the other ions. Therefore, ionophores with different binding strengths can be used in the sensor. Results In the present work, poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC) based membrane incorporating tris (2 pyridyl) methylamine (tpm) as an ionophore has been prepared and explored as a titanium(III) selective sensor. Conclusions The strengths of the ion–ionophore (Ti(OH) 2 + -tpm) interactions and the role of ionophore on membrane were tested by various techniques such as elemental analysis, UV–vis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD).

We consider a linear chain of N ion qubits that is prepared in a particular Fock state of motion, |m>.
