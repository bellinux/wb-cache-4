40|$|In Polish {{legal system}} law about {{conditions}} of admissibility and supervising of public assistance for entrepreneurs is basic legal act, which regulates conditions which {{have to be}} fulfilled, to obtain public assistance. Such support is treated as a public assistance {{only if it is}} based on national public resources and it does not violate or does not <b>threaten</b> <b>infringement</b> of competition through privilege of some entrepreneurs or production of some commodities. Public assistance has to be made also onto thing of definite entrepreneurs. In Poland in years 1997 - 2002 the largest part of public assistance was directed to large state owned enterprises first of all in coal mining, agriculture as well as railway transportation sector and postal services. In year 2002 we could observe significant changes in the structure of this support. There was a great increase of support for the enterprises from private sector especially small and medium size. This change was due to the low of restructuring of public receivables. Enterprises use help in form of transfer of properties’ value and in form of decrease of tax burdens. Public assistance is a very important instrument for supporting competitiveness and elasticity. Its efficiency depends on the forms of support of entrepreneurs, cohesions of used instruments as well as on possibility of theirs implementation through subjects.

5000|$|In 1942, in {{settlement}} of patent infringement litigation with inventors Gelbman and Andrus, Besser and Stearns entered into an agreement under which Stearns and Besser were each {{given the right}} to use the Gelbman and Andrus patents, but exclusively to them, and it was agreed that they were to have the benefit of, and right to use, any and all future improvements and patents covering concrete block making machines that Gelbman and Andrus might conceive. Not only were Gelbman and Andrus prohibited from licensing anyone else, but Besser and Stearns were each prohibited from licensing anyone else without the consent of the others. Besser continued to buy patents from others, and <b>threatened</b> patent <b>infringement</b> suit without even having seen the accused machines.|$|R

40|$|Apple {{invites us}} to “Rip. Mix. Burn. ” while Sony exhorts us to “make. believe. ” Digital service {{providers}} enable us to create new forms of derivative work—work based substantially on one or more preexisting works. But can we, in a carefree and creative spirit, remix music, movies, and television shows without fear of copyright infringement liability? Despite the exponential growth of remixing technologies, content holders continue {{to benefit from the}} vagaries of copyright law. There are no clear principles to determine whether any given remix will infringe one or more copyrights. Thus, rights holders can easily and plausibly <b>threaten</b> <b>infringement</b> suits and potentially chill much creative activity. This Article examines the impact of copyright doctrine on remixes with an emphasis on crowdsourced projects. Such an analysis is particularly salient at this juncture because consumers are neither as passive nor as isolated as they once were. Specifically, large-scale crowdsourced projects raise issues relating to copyright and fair use on a scope and scale never before imaginable. As such, this Article reflects on the particular problems raised by the growth of crowdsourced projects and how our copyright regime can best address them. We conclude that future legal developments will require a thoughtful and sophisticated balance to facilitate free speech, artistic expression, and commercial profit. To this end, we suggest a number of options for legal reform, including: (1) reworking the strict liability basis of copyright infringement for noncommercial works, (2) tempering damages awards for noncommercial or innocent infringement, (3) creating an “intermediate liability” regime that gives courts a middle ground between infringement and fair use, (4) developing clearer ex ante guidelines for fair use, and (5) reworking the statutory definition of “derivative work” to exclude noncommercial remixing activities...|$|R

40|$|We {{are at a}} {{crossroads}} {{with respect to the}} under-developed equitable defense of copyright misuse. The defense may go the way of its sibling, antitrust-based patent misuse, which seems to be in a state of inevitable decline. Or – if judges accept the proposal of this Article – courts could reinvigorate the copyright misuse defense to better protect First Amendment speech that is guaranteed by statute, but that is often chilled by copyright holders misusing their copyrights to control other’s speech. The Copyright Act serves First Amendment interests by encouraging authors to create works. But copyright law can also discourage the creation of new works by preventing subsequent creators from using copyrighted work to make their own, new speech. Courts have long recognized this inherent tension, and have also recognized that the conflict should sometimes be decided in favor of allowing a subsequent speaker the right to make unauthorized use of others’ copyrighted works. Accordingly, courts created, and Congress codified, the fair use defense to copyright infringement, which allows unauthorized use of copyrighted works under certain circumstances that encourage speech and creation of transformative works. The problem with fair use, however, is that the informational uncertainties and transaction costs of litigating the defense make the fair use right unavailable to many as a practical matter. Subsequent creators are left open to intimidation by copyright holders <b>threatening</b> <b>infringement</b> suits. By decoupling the copyright misuse defense from its basis in antitrust principles and basing it in First Amendment speech principles, the legal protections for fair use shift from theoretical rights to practical rights for many. Copyright misuse has two deterrent features that will allow fair use as a practical right. First, a copyright holder’s misuse of its copyrights against anyone can be used to prove the defense of misuse. Second, once misuse is found, the copyright owner loses its ability to enforce its copyright against everyone, at least until the misuse is cured. Thus, by defining as copyright misuse the unjustified chilling of speech that some copyright holders perpetrate, the misuse defense will encourage important speech rights that are currently under-protected...|$|R

40|$|This Essay, {{a chapter}} {{published}} in the book Hollywood and the Law (Palgrave Macmillan / British Film Institute, 2015), explores how courts have sought to balance the competing interests at stake when filmmakers make unauthorized uses of trademarks in their work and brand owners <b>threaten</b> liability for <b>infringement.</b> Using the seminal Rogers v. Grimaldi decision as a key pivot point, the Essay traces the remarkable change in approaches that courts have taken to First Amendment defenses in trademark cases {{in the past few}} decades. In presenting case studies of two opinions [...] Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc. v. Pussycat Cinema, Ltd. (decided a decade before Rogers) and Louis Vuitton v. Warner Bros.

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{alarming}} {{rise in the number}} of litigious entities—commonly referred to as patent trolls or non-practicing entities—that make no products but file dubious patent infringement lawsuits merely to extract money from commercially productive companies. High litigation costs provide a fertile environment for an exploitive business model that uses shotgun tactics to <b>threaten</b> patent <b>infringement</b> claims against numerous companies, many of which will make a purely financial decision to pay patent trolls rather than expend even more money in litigation. Sometimes the payoff is a settlement strategically set below the likely cost of litigation defense. Other times, the payoff is a license fee too small to justify expending litigation costs to adjudicate, even if it is likely a frivolous claim. Patent infringement claims asserted by patent trolls are a type of nuisance lawsuit—a lawsuit in which the defendant pays to make the lawsuit go away simply to avoid expending the considerable costs associated with litigation, not because the lawsuit has any significant merit or chance of success. While nuisance lawsuits are not new, the direct, focused, and widespread negative effects of nuisance patent lawsuits on innovation and productive entities by those neither innovating nor producing anything make these lawsuits particularly damaging to society. In addition, the public’s negative perception of patent trolls filing baseless patent infringement claims endangers the legitimacy of the patent system as a whole. Most people agree something must be done, but there is little agreement on any specific solution, approach, or strategy. Yet one need only look to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for a suitable remedy to help curb this vexing problem. This Article proposes a specialized implementation of Rule 11 to combat some of the unique difficulties created by the patent-trolling business model. A Rule 11 -based solution is not only preferable to new legislation, but also complementary because it is 1) immediately available without any legislative action, 2) flexible enough to handle evolving behavior that exploits patent litigation inefficiencies through bad-faith patent infringement claims, and 3) strong enough to deter variations of patent-trolling behavior—whether conducted by a traditional patent troll, NPE, PAE, or even a commercially active entity. Broadly stated, this approach identifies patent- trolling-predisposed claimants before the accretion of discovery costs and provides a swifter litigation exit ramp. The proposed inquiry treats all NPEs the same and analyzes objective indicia as proxies for ascertaining the intent behind the entity’s litigious conduct. In sum, an upfront application of Rule 11 provides a less expensive escape route to end the most readily detectable patent infringement nuisance lawsuits...|$|R
