5|$|The picture {{painted by}} the few and {{scattered}} {{references to the}} Cretan emirate from the Muslim world, on the other hand, is of an ordered state with a regular monetary economy and extensive trade links, and {{there is evidence that}} Chandax was a cultural centre of some importance. The survival of numerous gold, silver, and copper coins, of almost constant weight and composition, testifies to a strong economy and a high living standard among the population. The economy was strengthened by extensive trade {{with the rest of the}} Muslim world, especially with Egypt, and by a booming agriculture: the need to sustain an independent state, as well as access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>markets</b> of the Muslim world, led to an intensification of cultivation. It is also possible that sugar cane was introduced to Crete at the time.|$|E
5|$|While {{some of the}} {{conditions}} to allow a currency war were in place at various points throughout this period, countries generally had contrasting priorities and at no point were there enough states simultaneously wanting to devalue for a currency war to break out. On several occasions countries were desperately attempting not to cause a devaluation but to prevent one. So states were striving not against other countries but against market forces that were exerting undesirable downwards pressure on their currencies. Examples include The United Kingdom during Black Wednesday and various tiger economies during the Asian crises of 1997. During the mid-1980s the United States did desire to devalue significantly, but were able to secure the cooperation of other major economies with the Plaza Accord. As free market influences approached their zenith during the 1990s, advanced economies and increasingly transition and even emerging economies moved {{to the view that}} it was best to leave the running of their economies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>markets</b> and not to intervene even to correct a substantial current account deficit.|$|E

25|$|Settlers, {{mostly from}} Georgia and the Carolinas, flooded into the fertile land that the Creeks {{had been forced}} to give up. With its {{strategic}} location at the river confluence, Wetumpka quickly became an important center of agricultural trade. The city was formally incorporated in 1834. Cotton was the commodity crop of the new state of Alabama, with cultivation of short-staple cotton in the upland areas made possible by Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin, which reduced the labor of processing. From the scattered fields and large plantations worked by slave labor in the interior, cotton was carted overland to Wetumpka. Located at the fall line of the Coosa River, the port shipped out cotton bales by steamboats which went downriver <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>markets</b> at Mobile for sale.|$|E
25|$|Less than 30 pence {{in every}} pound spent on some carbon offset schemes goes {{directly}} to projects {{designed to reduce}} emissions. The figures reported by the BBC and based on UN data reported that typically 28p goes to the set up and maintenance costs of an environmental project. 34p goes to the company that takes on {{the risk that the}} project may fail. The project's investors take 19p, with smaller amounts of money being distributed between organisations involved in brokering and auditing the carbon credits. In that respect carbon Offsets are similar to most consumer products, with only a fraction of sale prices going to the off-shore producers, the rest being shared between investors and distributors who bring it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>markets,</b> who themselves need to pay their employees and service providers such as advertising agencies most of the time located in expensive areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{region of}} Beaujolais was first {{cultivated}} by the Romans who planted the areas along its trading route up the Saône valley. The most noticeable Roman vineyard was Brulliacus {{located on the}} hillside of Mont Brouilly. The Romans also planted vineyards in the area Morgon. From the 7th century through the Middle Ages, most of the viticulture and winemaking {{was done by the}} Benedictine monks. In the 10th century, the region got its name from the town of Beaujeu, Rhône and was ruled by the Lords of Beaujeu till the 15th century when it was ceded to the Duchy of Burgundy. The wines from Beaujolais were mostly confined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>markets</b> along the Saône and Rhône, particularly in the town of Lyon. The expansion of the French railroad system in the 19th century opened up the lucrative Paris market. The first mention of Beaujolais wines in English followed soon after when Cyrus Redding described the wines of Moulin-à-Vent and Saint-Amour as being low priced and best consumed young.|$|E

25|$|Some slaveholders made {{a profit}} by selling surplus slaves to traders for {{transport}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>markets</b> of the Deep South, where the demand was still high for field hands on cotton plantations. In {{contrast to the}} near-unanimity of voters in the seven cotton states in the lower South, which held {{the highest number of}} slaves, the border slave states were bitterly divided about secession and were not eager to leave the Union. Border Unionists hoped that a compromise would be reached, and they assumed that Lincoln would not send troops to attack the South. Border secessionists paid less attention to the slavery issue in 1861, since their states' economies were based more on trade with the North than on cotton. Their main concern in 1861 was federal coercion; some residents viewed Lincoln's call to arms as a repudiation of the American traditions of states' rights, democracy, liberty, and a republican form of government. Secessionists insisted that Washington had usurped illegitimate powers in defiance of the Constitution, and thereby had lost its legitimacy. After Lincoln issued a call for troops, Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, and North Carolina promptly seceded and joined the Confederacy. A secession movement began in western Virginia, where most farmers were yeomen and not slaveholders, to break away and remain in the Union.|$|E
