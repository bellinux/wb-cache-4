Seth Davis of Sports Illustrated was not complimentary towards Connick: [...] "Whoever {{came up with the idea}} to cast Connick on Will & Grace should be fired." [...] A writer from Entertainment Weekly, however, commented that Leo [...] "fits right in to the antic Will & Grace world of Will, Grace, Jack, and Karen." [...] Matt Roush of TV Guide was not thrilled of the idea of Grace getting married, writing: [...] "Well, is the show called Will & Grace & Leo? I don't think so." [...] The Star-Ledgers Alan Sepinwall commented that Will & Grace [...] "has already been infected with a sense of cattiness and despair, as the writers try to top each other's nasty one-liners.
