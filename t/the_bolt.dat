5|$|The MP 40 submachine {{guns are}} open-bolt, blowback-operated {{automatic}} arms. The only mode of fire was fully automatic, but {{the relatively low}} rate of fire enabled single shots with controlled trigger pulls. <b>The</b> <b>bolt</b> features a telescoping return spring guide {{which serves as a}} pneumatic recoil buffer. The cocking handle was permanently attached to <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> on early MP 38s, but on late production MP 38s and MP 40s, <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> handle was made as a separate part. It also served as a safety by pushing the head of handle into one of two separate notches above the main opening; this action locked <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> either in the cocked (rear) or uncocked (forward) position. The absence of this feature on early MP 38s resulted in field expedients such as leather harnesses with a small loop, used to hold <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> in forward position.|$|E

5|$|Initial aerial firing {{tests with}} the Vulcan cannon {{on the second}} {{aircraft}} were successful, but on 17 December, {{there was an explosion}} during a firing burst and the J65 engine suffered severe compressor stalls. Tony LeVier immediately shut down the engine and glided back to make a successful deadstick landing at Rogers Dry Lake. An investigation later showed that one of the 20mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech, blowing <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell. Jet fuel had run into the gun bay, and leaked out of the compartment door seals and into the left engine air intake. The engine immediately flooded with fuel, causing the compressor stalls.|$|E

25|$|At this point, <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> {{is locked}} into the barrel {{extension}} by locking lugs, so the expanding gas forces <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier backward a short distance. As <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier {{moves toward the}} butt of the gun, <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> cam pin, riding in a slot on <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier, forces <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> to rotate and thus unlocks it from the barrel extension. Once <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> is fully unlocked it begins its rearward movement along with <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier. The bolt's rearward motion extracts the empty cartridge case from the chamber. As soon as the neck of the case clears the barrel extension, the bolt's spring-loaded ejector forces it out the ejection port {{in the side of the}} upper receiver.|$|E
25|$|A bolt hold-open device locks <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier {{assembly}} open after expending the last cartridge from {{the magazine and}} is released by lifting <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> catch lever located {{on the left side}} of the receiver.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>bolt</b> in <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> lock is a {{rectangle}} of metal that is constrained to slide only back and forward. When the knife is open a spring biases <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> to the forward position where it rests above the tang {{of the blade}} preventing the blade from closing. Small knobs extend through {{the handle of the}} knife on both sides allowing the user to slide <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> backwards freeing the knife to close. The Axis Lock used by knife maker Benchmade is functionally identical to <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> lock except that it uses a cylinder rather than {{a rectangle}} to trap the blade. The Arc Lock by knife maker SOG is similar to the Axis Lock except the cylinder follows a curved path rather than a straight path.|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} the characteristics and structural properties of bolted connections in steel structures with the main focus on the design adequacy and failure mechanisms of high-strength friction-grip (HSFG) bolted connections.  As a case study, <b>the</b> <b>bolted</b> connections on <b>the</b> Mary River Bridge along Arnhem Highway in the Northern Territory have been investigated. The composite highway bridge is composed of reinforced concrete deck over five simply supported spans of structural steelwork. The structural steelwork includes five main UB girders connected to diaphragms and horizontal bracings by HSFG bolted connections. Initial inspection of the bridge found {{that a number of}} bolts were loosened, missing or had already fractured and most were heavily corroded. Remedial works in which <b>the</b> original <b>bolted</b> connections have been replaced and the new ones ensured to be installed at the correct tension have been recently completed.  The structural and environmental factors that {{may have contributed to the}} eventual failure of <b>the</b> <b>bolts</b> have been investigated. The design adequacy of <b>the</b> <b>bolted</b> connections compared to the externally applied loads on the bridge superstructure was checked in accordance with current standards: AS 5100 and AS 4100. The failure mechanisms of <b>the</b> fractured <b>bolts</b> were investigated. <b>The</b> residual loads on <b>the</b> original <b>bolts</b> have been identified through slip testing on both <b>the</b> original <b>bolts</b> and new HSFG bolts in double shear configuration. <b>The</b> fractured <b>bolts</b> were analysed through optical and scanned electron microscopy. The design fatigue life of <b>the</b> <b>bolts</b> were identified through fatigue testing of <b>the</b> M 16 <b>bolts</b> in double shear configuration and <b>the</b> M 22 <b>bolts</b> subjected to cyclic tensile load. The difference of the rate of corrosion of <b>the</b> <b>bolts</b> with and without the zinc plate corrosion protection was also identified.  It was found that the main factors the contributed to the failure of <b>the</b> <b>bolted</b> connections at <b>the</b> Mary River Bridge include overstressing of <b>the</b> <b>bolts,</b> <b>the</b> fluctuating loads, the eventual abrasion and wear of the corrosive protection and the corrosive environment it was subjected to. The failure mechanisms of <b>the</b> fractured <b>bolts</b> were mainly due to corrosion and fretting fatigue. Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>bolts</b> subjected to tension, have failed due to self-loosening over time...|$|R

25|$|The {{addition}} of a bolt accelerator to the Lahti pistol was to ensure {{the performance of the}} pistol in arctic conditions in Finland. Bolt accelerators are more commonly found in machine guns to increase the rate of fire. <b>The</b> <b>bolt</b> accelerator in the Lahti works by having a crank lever strike <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> of the pistol as it unlocks from firing. This thrusts <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> mechanically instead of relying on the momentum of firing alone to move <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> back. The value of the {{addition of}} <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> accelerator was put into question with a batch of guns made without an accelerator being produced. The immediate recall of the pistols without bolt accelerators is thought to indicate the accelerator is not essential but useful in the operation of the gun.|$|E
25|$|In {{both the}} tension and shear joint design cases, some level of tension preload in <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> and {{resulting}} compression preload in the clamped components {{is essential to the}} joint integrity. The preload target can be achieved by a variety of methods: applying a measured torque to <b>the</b> <b>bolt,</b> measuring bolt extension, heating to expand <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> then turning the nut down, torquing <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> to the yield point, testing ultrasonically, or by applying a certain number of degrees of relative rotation of the threaded components. Each method has a range of uncertainties associated with it, some of which are very substantial.|$|E
25|$|The {{second type}} of bolted joint {{transfers}} the applied load in shear of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> shank and relies on the shear strength of <b>the</b> <b>bolt.</b> Tension loads on such a joint are only incidental. A preload is still applied but consideration of joint flexibility is not as critical {{as in the case}} where loads are transmitted through the joint in tension. Other such shear joints do not employ a preload on <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> as they are designed to allow rotation of the joint about <b>the</b> <b>bolt,</b> but use other methods of maintaining bolt/joint integrity. Joints that allow rotation include clevis linkages, and rely on a locking mechanism (like lock washers, thread adhesives, and lock nuts).|$|E

25|$|When a {{fastener}} is torqued, a tension preload develops in <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> and an equal compressive preload develops in the parts being fastened. This can be modeled as a spring-like assembly {{that has some}} assumed distribution of compressive strain in the clamped joint components. When an external tension load is applied, it relieves the compressive strains induced by the preload in the clamped components, hence the preload acting on the compressed joint components provides the external tension load with a path (through the joint) other than through <b>the</b> <b>bolt.</b> In a well designed joint, perhaps 80-90% of the externally applied tension load will pass through the joint and the remainder through <b>the</b> <b>bolt.</b> This reduces the fatigue loading of <b>the</b> <b>bolt.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Desert Eagle uses a gas-operated {{mechanism}} normally {{found in}} rifles, {{as opposed to}} the short recoil or blow-back designs most commonly seen in semi-automatic pistols. When a round is fired, gases are ported out through a small hole in the barrel near the breech. These travel forward through a small tube under the barrel, to a cylinder near the front of the barrel. The slide which acts as <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier has a small piston on the front that fits into this cylinder. When the gases reach the cylinder they push the piston rearward. The slide rides rearward on two rails {{on either side of the}} barrel, both with action springs around them, with a large pin inside the camming surface in the rear of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> that causes <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> to rotate and unlock. A cylindrical mechanism on the left side of <b>the</b> <b>bolt,</b> called <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> stabilizer assembly, prevents <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> from rotating freely as the slide moves, enabling it to align correctly with the barrel again as the slide moves it forward. The spring loaded ejector pin is continually being depressed by the case, until the case is free of the chamber and releases tension from the ejector, causing the case to fly out, becoming released from the extractor claw in the process. The slide reaches its rear-most travel, then rides forward again under tension of the springs around the slide rails, the bottom lug of <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> pushes a new round into the chamber, then <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> locks up and the gun can be fired again once the trigger is released.|$|E
