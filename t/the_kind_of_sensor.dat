40|$|Today, {{one of the}} {{important}} issues in business is environmental advertisements. Advertisement is an extensive business among the world’s top industries and in parallel with industries such as oil, automobile, information technology, and agriculture. Growth of advertisement industry in each country has a close relation with the level of commercial activities and its healthy economic. In fact, the growth of advertisement industry expresses the level of people’s life in a country and indicates its economic development. Recent progress in the field of electronics and wireless communication has made it possible to design and make sensors with low power consumption, small size, proper cost, and various applications. These small sensors with the ability to do the activities such as receiving different environmental information (depends on <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensor),</b> processing, and sending the information has created an idea for developing networks called wireless sensor networks(Culler, 2004) (WSN) (Krishnan et al, 2003). WSNs (CHEE-YEE, 2003) are composed of so many sensor nodes which are shared for monitoring the desired area. Using this kind of network was generalized due to its applicability in different fields such as environmental, industrial, and others. In this paper, we tried to present a new method in the field of controlling and showing advertisements, express the efficiency and effectiveness of this method for reducing energy consumption in billboards.

Target applications are robotic systems including medical robots. This project is decomposed in two phases. These two phases are reported in the main parts of this document (overview and proof-of-concept prototype). The first phase deals with concept and general architecture. The following actions take place:     We present target applications, and <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensor</b> {{that can be used}} in them.      Existing similar research projects were investigated: Usually, documents related to these projects are open documents. That means that one has an idea about how work has been done, and what can be done (limits) in terms of technology. The drawbacks are that final products do not exist or that they are not described in any document.      We investigated also off-the-shelf (commercial) wireless sensors: This class of information is useful to know what is reachable in terms of final products. However, you do not know how company did it: the "Commercial product"term implies usually a secret process.     We list the electronic modules, which can be candidate for a wireless sensor device. That implies RF (Radio Frequency) modules, micro controller modules, energy technology, and sensor devices.     We report uncertainties about technology and functionality that should be cleared up within a prototype project. The second phase is related to a proof-of-concept prototype. The goal of this prototype is to know if the concept, as defined during the first phase, works in real. We report how we successfully built a wireless sensor. Aspects presented are as follows: About the test bed itself: specification, hardware description, embedded software, purchased list and cost, are given. About the development environment: tools for programming and debugging the test bed, and experiments per-formed are described. We report also the experiments results and discuss the prototype. Off-the-shelf modules have been bought when existing. We tested the concept by using a dual axis inclination sensor. We chose this sensor because we had a previous experience with it.

40|$|Abstract — Autonomous {{control of}} ultra-light indoor microflyers is a {{difficult}} and largely unsolved task because of the strong limitations on <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensors</b> that can be embedded. We propose a new approach for altitude control of a 10 -gram microflyer, where altitude as well as pitch angle are estimated using a set of visual, airspeed and gyroscopic sensors that weight about 1 (g) in total. This approach does not rely on an explicit estimation of optic flow, but rather takes as input the raw images as provided by the vision sensor.

40|$|Abstract — Fully {{autonomous}} {{control of}} ultra-light indoor airplanes {{has not yet}} been achieved because of the strong limitations on <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensors</b> that can be embedded making it difficult to obtain good estimations of altitude.

We show that this strategy is successful at controlling a simulated microflyer without any explicit altitude estimation and using only simple sensors and processing that have already been embedded in an existing 10 -gram microflyer. This result is thus a significant step toward autonomous control of indoor flying robots. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of human activities {{is one of}} the most intriguing and important open issues for the automated video surveillance community. Since few years ago, it has been handled following a mere Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition perspective, where an activity corresponded to a temporal sequence of explicit actions (run, stop, sit, walk, etc.).

40|$|Sensors {{are playing}} an {{increasingly}} important role in our lives, and for these devices to perform to their maximum potential, they need to work together. A single device can provide a single service or a fixed set of services but, when combined with other <b>sensors,</b> different classes <b>of</b> applications become implementable. The vital criterion {{for this to happen}} is the ability to bring information from all sensors together, so that all measured physical phenomena can contribute to the solution. Mediation between applications and physical sensors is the responsibility <b>of</b> <b>sensor</b> network middleware (SNM). Rapid growth in <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensors</b> and applications for sensors/sensor systems, and the consequent importance <b>of</b> <b>sensor</b> network middleware has raised the need to relatively rapidly build engineering applications from those components. A number of SNM exist, each of which attempts to solve the sensor integration problem in a different way. These solutions, based on their ‘closeness’ either to sensors or to applications, can be classified as low-level and high-level. Low-level SNM tends not to focus on making application development easy, while high-level SNM tends to be ‘locked-in’ to a particular set <b>of</b> <b>sensors.</b> We propose a SNM suitable for the task of activity monitoring founded on rules and events, integrated through a semantic event model.

A very interesting feature of this new generation of v-sensors—distinguishing them from the Microflown® ones (de Bree et al., Sens Actuators A Phys 54 : 552 – 557, 1996) —is their compatibility with standard CMOS industrial processes, so allowing to integrate in the same chip both the sensors and read-out electronic circuits. This added flexibility of v-sensors, combined with miniature or MEMS microphones, allows of setting up pressure–velocity (p–v) microprobes for specific applications, in particular when the reduction of production costs is decisive for marketing strategies. In many applications, in fact, carefully designed functional devices can be safely used, without prejudice to the reliability and the robustness of the required measurement process.
