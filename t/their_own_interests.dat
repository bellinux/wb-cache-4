5|$|The {{emergence}} of new forces of urban factions, rural voters, and others, engaging in continued conflict {{with each other for}} <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests,</b> meant that the problem of effective governance awaited resolution. The populist government of the Gracchi had come to an end by violence; and this provided a brutal precedent that would be followed by many other rulers of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} factors, the revolt was often considered to either be a {{manipulation of the}} commoners by a reactionary elite against modernization, a successful Ottoman bid to hamper Egypt's efforts to liberate and unify its Arab lands, or was sidelined. The concept that the revolt's diverse participants were acting based on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> and actual grievances rather than manipulation was largely ignored in Palestinian historiography until recent decades.|$|E
5|$|Seven years {{following}} the Grand War, a battle fought between three nations, the newest Skullgirl, Marie, has emerged and begun to terrorize the Canopy Kingdom. The game follows several fighters and their journeys to confront Marie and claim the Skull Heart. Each character has their own motive for seeking the Heart, whether to destroy the artifact or use its power for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{this way}} they congregated {{a group of}} Christian Indians in the {{location}} {{of what is now}} the town of Rabinal. Las Casas became instrumental in the introduction of the New Laws in 1542, established by the Spanish Crown to control the excesses of the conquistadors and colonists against the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas. As a result, the Dominicans met substantial resistance from the Spanish colonists, who saw <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> threatened by the New Laws; this distracted the Dominicans from their efforts to establish peaceful control over the Land of War.|$|E
5|$|When he {{ascended to}} the throne, Pedro II was {{only five years}} old. Until he came of age and {{would be able to}} exert his {{constitutional}} powers, a regency was created. It proved to be weak and to have little effective authority, which led the nation into anarchy, ravaged by political faction struggles and countless rebellions. Exploited as a tool by rival political factions in pursuit of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests,</b> Pedro II was manipulated into accepting an early elevation to majority status on 22 July 1840 at age 14, thus putting an end to nine years of chaotic regency rule.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, {{when the}} new {{communist}} regime outlawed the Greek-Catholic Church and forcibly merged it into the Orthodox Church, Agârbiceanu refused to join the latter denomination, thus setting himself up against the authorities. However, these found {{his reputation as a}} writer valuable for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests,</b> and preferred to try and co-opt him. In 1953, after a five-year marginalization for his refusal to turn Orthodox, Agârbiceanu joined the editorial board of Anatol E. Baconsky's semi-official literary magazine, Steaua. He was granted the Order of Labor the following year, and promoted to titular member of the Academy in 1955. On the occasion of his 80th birthday in 1962, he was also awarded the Order of the Star of the Romanian People's Republic, first class.|$|E
5000|$|... activeness ("the {{extent to}} which {{conflict}} behaviors make a responsive and direct rather than inert and indirect impression"). High activeness is characterized by openly discussing differences of opinion while fully going after <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Giving false {{evidence}} against someone {{is seen as}} the worst type of falsehood, and is considered a major sin in Islam. A person is required to maintain truth in giving evidence even if that goes against <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|R
60|$|But in {{the present}} {{instance}} they became sincerely parliamentary reformers, for by parliamentary reform they could alone subsist; and all their art was dedicated so to contrive, that in this reformation <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interest</b> should secure an irresistible predominance.|$|R
5|$|After the Square Enix merger, {{however, the}} {{individual}} teams still continued to program and customize their own tools for each game, which would eventually {{go to waste}} as only their respective creators {{knew how to use}} them. With the amount of assets and tools required by the in-development Final Fantasy XII and the impending advent of the seventh console generation, a common data format for the company was proposed in 2004. It was to be developed in-house and replace general-purpose formats such as FBX and COLLADA. Realizing the goal of an engine with a common set of tools proved to be difficult, as many production teams wanted to further <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> rather than those of the company as a whole. Select staff members from different company divisions teamed up to work on the project on a voluntary basis, but their loose organizational structure failed to yield results. Nevertheless, Murata considered this group effort a first step in the right direction. In 2005, he was appointed general manager of the newly formed Technology Division. Although this enabled Murata and his subordinates to talk about a company-wide engine more extensively, the lack of manpower again prevented any significant achievements.|$|E
5|$|As the Nameless officially do not exist, {{the upper}} echelons of the Gallian Army exploit {{the concept of}} {{plausible}} deniability in order to send them on missions that would otherwise make Gallia lose face in the war. While at times this works to their advantage, such as a successful incursion into Imperial territory, other orders cause certain members of the 422nd great distress. One such member, Gusurg, becomes so enraged that he abandons his post and defects {{into the ranks of}} Calamity Raven, attached to the ideal of Darcsen independence proposed by their leader, Dahau. At the same time, elements within Gallian Army Command move to erase the Nameless in order to protect <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests.</b> Hounded by both allies and enemies, and combined with the presence of a traitor within their ranks, the 422nd desperately move to keep themselves alive {{while at the same time}} fight to help the Gallian war effort. This continues until the Nameless's commanding officer, Ramsey Crowe, who had been kept under house arrest, is escorted to the capital city of Randgriz in order to present evidence exonerating the weary soldiers and expose the real traitor, the Gallian General that had accused Kurt of Treason.|$|E
5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, where no one knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E
30|$|Government policy {{always meant}} for common {{resources}} enhancement to eradicate poverty. Thus policy should hinder influential people to extract resources for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interest,</b> however, in reality present policy {{does not support}} poor people, musclemen are grabbing in association with politicians.|$|R

25|$|The American {{corporate}} media lobby {{has been}} involved in the shaping of media ownership regulations {{since the early days of}} the industry.

25|$|Probably {{the clearest}} inheritors of Veblen's ideas {{that humans are}} not rationally {{pursuing}} value and utility through their conspicuous consumption are adherents {{of the school of}} behavioral economics, who study the ways consumers and producers act against <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> in apparently non-rational ways.|$|E
60|$|But at last, as all violent Extremes rouze their {{contrary}} Extremeties, {{the folly}} and extravagance of the High Solunarians drove the Crolians into their Senses, and rouz'd them to <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>Interest,</b> the occasion was among {{a great many}} others as follows.|$|R

25|$|Emotional {{blackmail}} typically involves {{two people}} who have established a close personal or intimate relationship (parent and child, spouses, siblings, or two close friends). Children, too, will employ special pleading and emotional blackmail to promote <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests,</b> and self-development, within the family system.|$|E
25|$|The union, {{like most}} unions within the American Federation of Labor (AFL) at the time, had a largely {{decentralized}} structure, {{with a number}} of local unions that governed themselves autonomously and tended to look only after <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> in the geographical jurisdiction in which they operated.|$|E
25|$|The {{terms of}} each treaty {{specified}} that Italy was {{to steer clear}} of any interference in the sultanates' respective administrations. In return for Italian arms and an annual subsidy, the Sultans conceded to a minimum of oversight and economic concessions. The Italians also agreed to dispatch a few ambassadors to promote both the sultanates' and <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests.</b>|$|E
50|$|Advocacy: Advocates {{generally}} {{speak for}} {{others who are}} unable to represent <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interest</b> due to disability, inherent complexity of the venue such as courts and hospitals, or other factors. Community organizing emphasizes the virtue of trying to get those affected to speak for themselves.|$|R
50|$|The banking {{industry}} was slowly deregulated. In the mid-1960s, {{the distinction between}} trading and savings banks was removed and all banks were allowed {{to operate in the}} money market (traditionally the domain of merchant banks), and banks were allowed to set <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interest</b> rates.|$|R

The group has also been criticized for {{ignoring}} the views of residents affected by Federal City Council projects, of lacking accountability, and pursuing an agenda at odds {{with those of the}} public.|$|E
25|$|On 24 February 2015, {{president}} Erdogan {{speaking on}} television of the tentative {{plan for a}} cessation of hostilities in Syria announced by Russia and the U.S. two days prior, accused the UN, the West, Russia and Iran of seeking to further <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> in Syria and said he feared a U.S.-Russian ceasefire plan would {{do little more than}} benefit Syria′s president Bashar Assad.|$|E
25|$|Corporate {{governance}} in Vietnam is seen {{more as a}} management framework rather than a system for accountability and protecting minority shareholders. In particular, the LOE does not clearly mandate the separation of ownership and management. Separation of ownership and management promotes accountability by allowing managers to be objectively appraised. On the other hand, owners who serve as managers {{will be more likely}} to pursue <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>interests,</b> possibly at the expense of the interests of minority shareholders.|$|E

50|$|Starting out on {{a career}} in {{wildlife}} photography in 1929 was a bold move.
