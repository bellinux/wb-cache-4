5|$|Unlike {{wind and}} wave, tidal power is an {{inherently}} predictable source. However {{the technology is}} in its infancy and numerous devices are in the prototype stages. Today {{it is known that}} a tall <b>tubular</b> <b>tower</b> with three blades attached to it is the typical profile of a wind turbine, but twenty-five years ago there were a wide variety of different systems being tested. This is the current situation with regard to tidal power. Some systems capture energy from the tides in a vertical direction. The tide comes in and raises the water level in a basin. As the tide lowers the water in the basin is discharged through a turbine. Tidal stream power captures energy from the flow of tides, usually using underwater plant resembling a small wind turbine. An example is Marine Current Turbines SeaGen 1.2MW device at Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland, which is the largest tidal stream turbine in the world. To date the only two installed tidal power plants of notable size are the Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea and the Rance Tidal Power Station in Brittany, France, rated at 254 MW and 240 MW respectively.

25|$|Most of the MOD-series wind {{turbines}} went to sites outside of Ohio, {{but the first}} unit, the MOD-0 operated at NASA's Plum Brook facility near Sandusky from 1975 to 1988. Initially the wind turbine had a lattice tower, a 38.1m diameter two-bladed rotor mounted downwind from the tower, and a capacity of 100kW. Lockheed Corporation manufactured the aluminum rotor blades. The discovery of severe stress resulting from the rotor blades passing through the tower's wind shadow led to several redesigns. In 1979, NASA rebuilt the MOD-0 with an upwind rotor mounted on a teetering hub, with a steel spar reinforcing the blades. In 1982, a <b>tubular</b> <b>tower</b> replaced the lattice tower. Finally, in 1985 NASA tested a single-bladed rotor with a teetering hub. In 1981, two NASA Glenn engineers, Larry Viterna and Bob Corrigan, used the adjustable-pitch blade feature of the MOD-0 to invent an analytical method for calculating wind turbine output in high winds, which has since become widely used in the wind power industry as the Viterna method.|$|E

As {{part of the}} country's Integrated Resource Plan, these challenges are to be addressed. This involves a 20 year plan which aims to increase electricity supply capacity as well as reduce the reliance on coal power {{as part of the}} global trend to become more environmentally friendly. Wind power, specifically, is to account for {{a large portion of the}} renewable energy that is expected to become available by 2030. This results in the need for the understanding of wind turbine design by South African engineers. The dynamic analysis of wind turbine structures, is of particular interest to Civil Engineers. Wind turbine towers are recently of the monopole or <b>tubular</b> type <b>tower,</b> predominantly constructed of either concrete or steel or a combination of both. Steel <b>tubular</b> <b>towers</b> above a height of 80 m are generally not recommended for wind turbines owing to cost concerns as well as difficulties in meeting dynamic behaviour requirements. Concrete towers and steel-concrete hybrid towers are recommended for this height regime. The aim of this study was to assess the prospective use of steel <b>tubular</b> <b>towers</b> of varying geometric shape for wind turbines with tower heights of 80 m or greater. The study focussed on the analysis of natural frequency and assessing the applicability of steel <b>tubular</b> <b>towers</b> of geometric shapes that have not been previously explored or reported. The turbine of choice for this study was the Vestas V 112 3 MW type as this is one of the most commonly used and more efficient turbines for towers of this height regime. The results of this study showed that steel monopole towers of heights of 80 m and more are still viable options for wind turbine towers. Various geometric tower cases of heights varying from 80 m to 120 m, produced acceptable fundamental natural frequencies within the allowable frequency range for a Vestas V 112 3 MW turbine...|$|R

Investigation of the basic material properties of the down scale specimens was carried out by using coupon specimens cut off from the down scale specimens. Influences of cold forming on the properties of the material were also studied by using coupon specimens with different cold formed angles. 3 D scanning laser was used to determine initial geometrical imperfection of the down scale specimens.

40|$|The {{offshore}} wind power is an attractive renewable energy resource. To improve the wind power generation capacity, {{there is a strong}} desire for {{offshore wind}} turbine to go to deep waters. For offshore fixed wind turbine, stronger foundation like jacket structure has a good applicability for deeper water depth. A 70 -meters jacket substructure for offshore wind turbine is designed. This thesis focuses on the dynamic structural response analysis of this jacket substructure, with a particular focus on hot spot stress of critical points on tubular joints. Three types of models are applied for analyses in this thesis. For eigen-value analysis the entire modal including the wind turbine, <b>tubular</b> <b>tower</b> and jacket supporting structure is used in the program USFOS-VPOne. For hydrodynamic analysis the refined substructure model with complete jacket structure and <b>tubular</b> <b>tower</b> is applied in USFOS. The equivalent monopile model is constructed in HAWC 2 to predict wind loads. Eigen value analysis is performed to check the validity of decoupled method for dynamic response analysis. The first eigen period is about 2. 9 s, far less than the main wave input periods, which implies the wave loads are mainly quasi-static, therefore the simplified decoupled analysis method can be applied. The global modes, the blade modes and the modes related to jacket braces are identified. Hydrodynamic analysis is performed to compare wave loads with different regular wave theories, including: Extrapolated Airy theory, Stretched Wave theory, Stoke’s 5 th order wave theory and Stream Function theory. It is proved that for extreme wave conditions, higher order wave theories such as Stoke’s 5 thorder wave theory and Stream Function theory should be applied since linear wave theories will under-estimate the structural reactions. Dynamic structural response analysis is performed in time domain with decoupled analysis method. The effect of misalignment of wind and wave on hot spot stress at joints is studied. It is observed that wave propagation directions has more significant effects on structural response than wind directions, while wind force has more significant influence on dynamic structural response rather than wave forces no matter in which directions they are propagating. </p...|$|E
