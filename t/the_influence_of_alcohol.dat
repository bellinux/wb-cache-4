He allegedly absconded before the damages could be settled. According to interviews with China Central Television and Xinhua News Agency, Gui said that he had been consumed with guilt and had returned to China in October to face the consequences of his misdeed.|$|E
5|$|A {{division}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates nearly {{all aspects of the}} trucking industry. Truck drivers are limited by the number of daily and weekly hours they may drive, the roads and highways they may drive upon, and a lower legal definition of drunkenness. The Federal Highway Administration has established 0.04 percent as the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to be driving under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> States maintain a BAC level between 0.08 and 0.10 percent for non-CMV drivers. In some states, trucks also have special speed limits, in addition to restrictions on driving in certain lanes (normally the far right lanes of multi-lane highways).|$|E

According to Adler, Blythe is a calm, moderate, and well-read person. The defense also presented videos from various Lamb of God concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that Blythe regularly cheers to the crowd, but not to encourage people to climb the stage.|$|E
5|$|Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) {{operates}} {{on a woman}} who flatlines, and despite his attempts to revive her, his father Christian Shephard (John Terry) forces him to stop and call the time of death. It is later revealed that it was actually Christian's operation; Jack was called in by a nurse after it becomes apparent {{that his father was}} performing the surgery under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Christian attempts to cover this up by making Jack sign a form detailing the surgery, albeit with his inebriation omitted from the report, stating that the hospital will revoke his medical license if alcohol is mentioned.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the extant}} {{information}} about {{the last few days}} of Poe's life comes from his attending physician, Dr. John Joseph Moran, though his credibility is questionable. Poe was buried after a small funeral at the back of Westminster Hall and Burying Ground, but his remains were moved to a new grave with a larger monument in 1875. The newer monument also marks the burial place of Poe's wife, Virginia, and his mother-in-law, Maria. Theories as to what caused Poe's death include suicide, murder, cholera, hypoglycemia, rabies, syphilis, influenza, and that Poe was a victim of cooping. Evidence of <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> is strongly disputed.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} filmed in late October and early November 2007, {{primarily}} {{on the island of}} Oahu, where Lost is filmed. Several days before shooting, Daniel Dae Kim was arrested for driving under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> His arrest prompted speculation about his future on the series, due to co-stars Michelle Rodriguez (Ana-Lucia Cortez) and Cynthia Watros (Libby) leaving Lost after DUI arrests. With the revelation of Sun as one of the Oceanic Six, all six members have been revealed. Executive producers and writers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof left the identity of the sixth deliberately ambiguous to provoke debate after the episode.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{announcement}} in May 2006, Grand Theft Auto IV was widely anticipated. Upon release, the game received universal critical acclaim, with praise particularly {{directed at the}} game's narrative and open world design. However, the game also generated controversy, with criticism directed at the game's depiction of violence and players' ability to drive under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Grand Theft Auto IV broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history at the time, earning US $310 million in its first day and US $500 million in its first week. Considered {{one of the most}} significant titles of the seventh generation of video games, and by many critics as one of the greatest video games of all time, it won year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. A sequel, Grand Theft Auto V, was released in September 2013.|$|E
40|$|Experiments with colloid systems {{attempted}} {{to achieve a}} better understanding <b>of</b> biological processes. <b>The</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> on phosphatid coacervates was compared with their <b>influence</b> upon <b>the</b> protoplasmic membrane of living cells of the alga Chara ceratophylla. Some similarity could be seen between <b>the</b> <b>influences</b> <b>of</b> methanol, ethanol and butanol. But the alcohols exerted their <b>influence</b> upon <b>the</b> living membrane at much lower concentration than they did on the phosphatid coacervates (ratio 1 : 10) and on the dielectric medium (1 : 10). Propanol, however, decreased the permeability of the living protoplast, {{in the opinion of}} the author by condensation of the membrane, but opened up the phosphatid coacervate. Very low concentrations of propanol could, however, increase the permeability of the protoplasmic membrane in a similar way as it increased the volume of the coacervate. In explaining <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> on <b>the</b> permeability of the protoplasmic membrane the author considered: action on the carbon chains of the membrane components; action on the dielectric condition of the system; the structure of the system (amorphous or oriented). The use of phosphatid coacervates as a model did not mean that the protoplasmic membrane was thought to be an amorphous system. Alcohols would probably open up a protoplasmic membrane composed of oriented components. <p/...|$|R

5|$|In a 5–4 opinion, the Court {{held that}} forced {{extraction}} {{and analysis of}} a blood sample is not compelled testimony; therefore, it does not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The Court also held that intrusions into the human body ordinarily require a search warrant. However, the Court ruled that the involuntary, warrantless blood sample taken {{in this case was}} justified under the Fourth Amendment's exigent circumstances exception because evidence of blood alcohol would be destroyed by the body's natural metabolic processes if the officers were to wait for a warrant. In 2013, the Supreme Court clarified in Missouri v. McNeely that the natural metabolism of alcohol in the bloodstream is not a per se exigency that would always justify warrantless blood tests of individuals suspected of driving under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{state of}} civil {{disorder}} {{existed in the}} island's mountainous region after {{the invasion of the}} United States. The local Criollo, who now found themselves unemployed and felt that they had been exploited by their former employers, formed bands called 'Partidas". The Partidas, at first attacked and robbed many of the wealthy plantation owners, who were loyal to the Spanish Crown, in vengeance, however they later began to attack the businesses owned by the local natives. One of the most notable leaders of the Partidas was José Maldonado Román a.k.a. 'Aguila Blanca". Maldonado, who operated in the areas of Juana Díaz and Ponce, harassed the Spanish Civil Guard and later did the same to the American Forces. Another factor contributing to the state of civil disorder on the island was the lack of discipline of the American troops who were stationed on the island. These troops were not professional soldiers and were composed of volunteers. Many instances were reported where these men would act disorderly, under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol,</b> and get into fights with the local residents. The state of civil disorder came to a halt on the island after the military government began to rebuild Puerto Rico's infrastructure, thereby providing employment for many of the discontented and unemployed population, and when the volunteer troops were replaced by the regular Army.|$|E

30|$|The {{probability}} of a crash is reduced when driving on intersections or junctions. The coefficient of two-way roads variable has a positive sign, showing that the {{probability of}} a crash increases in these areas. It should be noticed that generally, this type of crash occurs on two-way roads, so the presence of this variable in the model is interesting. Further processing of modeling data clarifies that sometimes drivers who are under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> or drugs, drive in opposite direction on a one-way road. In these situations, the mentioned variable shows the significant effects of two-way roads on head-on crashes rather than one-way roads.|$|R
