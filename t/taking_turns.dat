40|$|History-dependent {{strategies}} {{are often used}} to support cooperation in repeated game models. Using the indefinitely repeated common-pool resource assignment game and a perfect stranger experimental design, this paper reports novel evidence that players who have successfully used an efficiency-enhancing <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategy will teach other players in subsequent supergames to adopt this strategy. We find that subjects engage in <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> frequently in both the Low Conflict and the High Conflict treatments. Prior experience with <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> significantly increases <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> in both treatments. Moreover, successful <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> often involves fast learning, and individuals with <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> experience {{are more likely to}} be teachers than inexperienced individuals. The comparative statics results show that teaching in such an environment also responds to incentives, since teaching is empirically more frequent in the Low Conflict treatment with higher benefits and lower costs. © 2012 Springer-Verlag. postprin...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} kinds of <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> {{strategies}} used in the three males? chatting. The importance of <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategies in chatting has motivated the writer to conduct this study. In his study, he wants to figure out about the highest occurrence of <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategies and how the way males converse and use <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategies in chatting. The writer derives <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategies from Stenstrom?s classification, that are <b>taking</b> the <b>turn</b> including starting up, taking over and interrupting, holding the turn containing filled pauses and verbal fillers, silent pauses, repetition and new start, and yielding the turn consisting of prompting, appealing and giving up. The subject {{of this study is}} three males of English Department students including the writer himself and his close friends. This thesis uses qualitative descriptive approach because the writer attempts to calculate and describe the data which he gets from the chatting. To collect the data, the writer records the chatting between the subjects of research in his house to have the chatting as natural as possible. Through the analysis, the writer finds out that the three males? chatting used all kinds of <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategies classified by Stenstrom. Moreover, <b>taking</b> the <b>turn</b> was the highest occurrence in the chatting. Hence, the participants produce the <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategies by giving signals...|$|R
5|$|Battles use a turn-based battle system, with {{a limited}} number of player units and enemy units each <b>taking</b> <b>turns</b> and moving across a grid-based battlefield: battles are won by the player {{defeating}} key enemy units such as commanders and other boss characters. In battle, the game transitions to a dedicated battle arena, where the battle plays out in real-time. Each action yields experience points (EXP), and when the character earns 100 EXP, they level up, their health increases, and their class-specified statistics are randomly raised. During missions, towns and secret vendors can be visited, where new items such as healing potions, weapons and armor can be purchased. Weapons and armor are specific to different characters, and each weapon has a limited lifespan before breaking when it reaches its limit. Currency is limited to certain scripted or player-driven events, or wagering on arena battles. If a character falls in battle, they are subjected to permanent death, removing them from subsequent missions {{and the rest of the}} storyline. The game ends if Marth falls in battle.|$|E
5|$|Battles use a turn-based battle system, {{with the}} player, enemies, and {{sometimes}} non-playable characters each <b>taking</b> <b>turns</b> and moving across a grid-based battlefield: battles are {{won by the}} player defeating all enemies in a map or killing a boss character. Enemies include human troops and monsters. The players are given {{a limited number of}} units, which are each assigned unique character classes that have various functions in battle, such as being mounted or having access to magic. A unit's class also affects their range of movement on the battlefield. In contrast to the previous game, character classes are not set but can switch once a character reaches a certain level. A special example of class promotion is the two main characters: Alm can promote from a Fighter to a Hero, while Celica promotes from a Priestess to a Princess. Each time a unit raises its experience level, its various stats increase based on a percent chance unique for each character. Spells for magical classes are learned through leveling up rather than being part of a separate system, and each spell consumes part of the caster's health when used.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{classroom}} interactions using a conversation analytic approach {{to explore the}} relationship between <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> and silences in classroom interaction. Seventeen mathematics lessons with pupils aged between 12 and 14 years were analysed {{in terms of the}} structure of <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> and the length and nature of pauses that occurred during whole class interactions. We show that the <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> structure of classroom interactions remains consistent with that described in the conversation analytic literature. In classroom interactions where different <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> structures apply, silences have a different influence on student and teacher behaviour. We then demonstrate that the pedagogical construct of wait time is structurally built into classrooms with a formal <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> structure and that this structure explains many of the previous research findings relating to the length of wait time. These findings have implications for pedagogic policies and recommendations relating to classroom interactions. © 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|If a {{conversation}} is held, <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> must take place {{which means that}} there must be changes of the speaker?s turn during the conversation. Strenstrom theory (1994) divides <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategies into <b>taking</b> the <b>turn</b> strategy, holding the turn strategy and yielding the turn strategy. Sometimes, there is a dominant speaker who talks longer than others. However, gender {{can be one of the}} some aspects that can influence someone to be a dominant speaker. Tannen said that men are more dominant than women in the conversation. Recently, there is an issue which states that actually women are more dominant than men in the conversation. Next, the writer chooses the film Pretty Woman as the sources of this research because the story is very popular and also <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> is found in the conversation. Therefore, the writer wants to know the dominant speaker between the main characters based on gender, especially in using the <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategies. In this research, the writer uses both qualitative and quantitative research because the result of the quantitative research can support the final result of this research. The source of this research is only the main conversation between the main characters. After analyzing the data by using the Strenstrom?s theory, the writer finds out that <b>taking</b> the <b>turn</b> is the highest strategy that occurs between the main characters in Pretty Woman. Another finding is the dominant speaker between the main characters is a female. Moreover, some characteristics of using the <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategies that are used by a dominant speaker in dominating other speakers in this research are using <b>taking</b> the <b>turn</b> strategy, especially uptake, a clean start, alert. In using those strategies, she usually gives respond and then starts a new topic again with questioning the previous speaker. Sometimes, the dominant speaker here gives her respond by using high intonation, so she tends to interrupt the male speaker who is still talking. Besides, the dominant speaker also uses holding the turn, especially new start. From the findings, the writer can conclude that the Tannen?s theory cannot be applied in this researc...|$|R

40|$|The Battle of the Sexes game, which captures both {{conflict}} and coordination problems, {{has been applied}} {{to a wide range of}} situations.

Using this insight, we decompose the benefit from <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> into conflict-mitigating and coordination-enhancing components. Our analysis suggests that an equilibrium measure of the "intertemporal degree of conflict" provides an intuitive way to understand the sources of welfare gain from <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> in the repeated Battle of the Sexes game. We find that when this equilibrium measure is higher, players behave more aggressively and the welfare gain from <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> is smaller...|$|R
