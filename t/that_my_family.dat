500|$|The {{book has}} {{eighteen}} chapters with a two-page preface, which explains {{his experience with}} Metamorphosis and how this book complements it. The thesis of this book is identified by one reviewer as: [...] "the importance of childhood's formative years {{for the development of}} the person. In Suzuki's case, it is the effects of racism, notably time spent in BC's internment camps during the Second World War, that still haunt him." [...] In an interview, Suzuki said, [...] "my drive to do well has been motivated by the desire to demonstrate to my fellow Canadians <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>family</b> and I had not deserved to be treated as we were". Suzuki identifies a turning point of his life as winning his high school's student presidential election. He initially refused to run believing he was not popular enough. His father encouraged him, saying: [...] "There's no disgrace in losing... The important thing is trying." [...] Suzuki ran and unexpectedly won with an [...] "outsider" [...] platform.|$|E
2500|$|Charles has {{expressed}} scepticism that his father's genuine {{intention was to}} disinherit him dynastically, [...] "Without doubt, he had a mood swing, exploited by conservative elements in his entourage with whom I have long clashed.... I am fighting so <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>family</b> ceases to be the victim of attempted manipulation." [...] Moreover, Prince Charles denies {{that his father had}} the authority, by law or tradition, to exclude him from the order of succession: [...] "Even if I accept their premise, referring me to the Senatus Consultus of Napoleon III, divorce did not exist under the Second Empire, so it cannot be taken into account for the succession.... Moreover, the hypocrisy of this argument is exposed by the dates: My father's will was written in May 1996. I only re-married in October. All that matters is the Bonaparte tradition, which makes the eldest son the natural heir of his father." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thornhill, Connecticut – {{the village}} near which the Austins live {{in most of}} the books. The Austin home is akin to the Murry {{farmhouse}} and to Crosswicks in size, age and environs; for example, all three have a [...] "star-watching rock" [...] out back. The Austin house is outside Thornhill, {{at the end of a}} dirt road that intersects the [...] "old Boston Post Road". [...] The Austins have an old barn, in which Vicky's brother John works on building a mock-up of a space suit. Dr. Austin sees patients a few evenings a week in his office at one end of the house, which has its own entrance. A short drive from the Austin house is Hawk Mountain (apparently a fictionalized version of Mohawk Mountain near Cornwall, Connecticut), another place the family goes to talk and look at stars. The nearby town is Clovenford, where Dr. Austin works at the regional hospital. The state in which Thornhill is located is not initially given, but in The Moon by Night John Austin tells Zachary Gray that the family is from Connecticut. L'Engle and her family, the Franklins, lived in a similar Connecticut locale when Meet the Austins was written. In a 1995 introduction to the Austin family paperbacks, L'Engle states that [...] "Indeed, the Austins do a great many things <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>family</b> did, including living in a small dairy farm village." [...] L'Engle also mentions Clovenford in a fictional incident in A Circle of Quiet (p.87).|$|E

60|$|But {{merely to}} smile and smile is not to partake; so I ventured to suggest that to judge from my last letter from my godmother she, at any rate, was in her usual health; and I added, rather more cheerfully perhaps than the fact warranted, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>family</b> seemed to be doomed too, since, so far as I was aware, I myself {{was the last of}} it left alive.|$|E

'Mr. Micawber being {{now on the}} eve {{of casting}} off the pecuniary {{shackles}} that have so long enthralled him,' said Mrs. Micawber, 'and of commencing a new career in a country where there is sufficient range for his abilities,--which, in my opinion, is exceedingly important; Mr. Micawber's abilities peculiarly requiring space,--it seems to me <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>family</b> should signalize the occasion by coming forward. What I could wish to see, would be a meeting between Mr. Micawber and my family at a festive entertainment, to be given at my family's expense; where Mr. Micawber's health and prosperity being proposed, by some leading member of my family, Mr. Micawber might have an opportunity of developing his views.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He {{has left}} me, {{as he left}} me before, with an {{absorbing}} subject of interest to think of in his absence. I noticed a change in him the moment he entered the room. When he told me of the funeral, and of his parting with Armadale on board the yacht, though he spoke with feelings deeply moved, he spoke with a mastery over himself which is new {{to me in my}} experience of him. It was the same when our talk turned next on our own hopes and prospects. He was plainly disappointed when he found <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>family</b> embarrassments would prevent our meeting to-morrow, and plainly uneasy at the prospect of leaving me to find my way by myself on Monday to the church. But there was a certain hopefulness and composure of manner underlying it all, which produced so strong an impression on me that I was obliged to notice it.|$|E
60|$|There was, however, {{another and}} a present cause for un-easiness {{that gave me}} even more concern than the fact <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>family</b> reached the dark ages with so much {{embarrassing}} facility. In witnessing the dying agony of my ancestor I had got a dread lesson on the vanity, the hopeless character, the dangers, and the delusions of wealth that time can never eradicate. The history of its accumulation was ever present to mar the pleasure of its possession. I do not mean that I suspected what by the world's convention is deemed dishonesty--of {{that there had been}} no necessity--but simply that the heartless and estranged existence, the waste of energies, the blunted charities, and the isolated and distrustful habits of my father appeared to me to be but poorly requited by the joyless ownership of its millions. I would have given largely to be directed {{in such a way as}} while escaping the wastefulness of the shoals of Scylla I might in my own case steer clear of the miserly rocks of Charybdis.|$|E

The upset price at which [...] "the said lands and barony and others" [...] were to be exposed was thirty years' purchase of the proven rental, which was about a fourth more than the property had fetched at the last sale. This, which was mentioned, I suppose, to show the improvable character of the land, would have given another some pain. But let me speak truth of myself in good as in evil--it pained not me. I was only angry that Fairscribe, who knew something generally of the extent of my funds, should have tantalized me by sending me information <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>family</b> property was in the market, since he must have known that the price was far out of my reach.|$|E

60|$|True, on my side, {{to every}} detail of our arrangement, I arose, on the day in question, before the servants, packed a few {{necessaries}} in a bag, took with me the little money I possessed, and bade farewell for ever to the rectory. I walked with good spirits to a town some thirty miles from home, and was set down the next morning in this great city of London. As I walked from the coach-office to the hotel, I could not help exulting in the pleasant change that had befallen me; beholding, meanwhile, with innocent delight, the traffic of the streets, and depicting, in all the colours of fancy, the reception that awaited me from John. But alas! when I inquired for Mr. Fanshawe, the porter assured me {{there was no such}} gentleman among the guests. By what channel our secret had leaked out, or what pressure had been brought to bear on the too facile John, I could never fathom. Enough <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>family</b> had triumphed; that I found myself alone in London, tender in years, smarting under the most sensible mortification, and by every sentiment of pride and self-respect debarred for ever from my father’s house.|$|E
60|$|I {{presume that}} there is no gentleman in Europe that has not heard of the house of Barry of Barryogue, of the kingdom of Ireland, than which a more famous name is not to be found in Gwillim or D'Hozier; and though, as a man of the world, I have learned to despise heartily the claims of some PRETENDERS to high birth who have no more {{genealogy}} than the lacquey who cleans my boots, and though I laugh to utter scorn the boasting of many of my countrymen, who are all for descending from kings of Ireland, and talk of a domain no bigger than would feed a pig {{as if it were a}} principality; yet truth compels me to assert <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>family</b> was the noblest of the island, and, perhaps, of the universal world; while their possessions, now insignificant and torn from us by war, by treachery, by the loss of time, by ancestral extravagance, by adhesion to the old faith and monarch, were formerly prodigious, and embraced many counties, at a time when Ireland was vastly more prosperous than now. I would assume the Irish crown over my coat-of-arms, but that there are so many silly pretenders to that distinction who bear it and render it common.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our {{first words}} of {{explanation}} informed me <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>family</b> name {{was known to}} her by repute. Who {{do you think she}} was? The eldest daughter of my uncle and yours--Andrew Vanstone. I had often heard my poor mother in past years speak of her brother Andrew, and I knew of that sad story at Combe-Raven. But our families, as you are aware, had always been estranged, and I had never seen my charming cousin before. She has the dark eyes and hair, and the gentle, retiring manners that I always admire in a woman. I don't want to renew our old disagreement about your father's conduct to those two sisters, or to deny that his brother Andrew may have behaved badly to him; I am willing to admit that the high moral position he took in the matter is quite unassailable by such a miserable sinner as I am; and I will not dispute that my own spendthrift habits incapacitate me from offering any opinion on the conduct of other people's pecuniary affairs. But, with all these allowances and drawbacks, I can tell you one thing, Noel.
