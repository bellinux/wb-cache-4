5|$|I {{think when}} you name a record, {{you have to choose}} {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. You also want to choose something that reflects not just <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> record, but <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E
5|$|Reitz's {{policies}} were appreciated by the Volksraad, reflecting {{the change in}} <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Afrikaner electorate towards Afrikaner nationalism. Months before the presidential election of 1893 the Volksraad endorsed Reitz's candidature with a vote of forty-three against eighteen. Reitz accepted the endorsement {{on the condition that}} he be allowed three months leave to Europe. On 22 November 1893 he was re-elected, again with a landslide majority.|$|E
5|$|The Easter Rising of 1916 {{was carried}} out by the latter group {{together}} with a smaller socialist militia, the Irish Citizen Army. The British response, executing fifteen leaders of the Rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand people, turned <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country in favour of the rebels. Support for Irish republicanism increased further due to the ongoing war in Europe, as well as the Conscription Crisis of 1918.|$|E
50|$|Group affective tone is an {{aggregate}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group and refers to <b>mood</b> at <b>the</b> group level <b>of</b> analysis. If <b>the</b> <b>moods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual group members are consistent, then group affective tone {{can be treated}} as a group property. If, for example, members of a group tend to be excited, energetic and enthusiastic, then the group itself can be described as being excited, energetic and enthusiastic. If the group members tend to be distressed, mistrustful and nervous, then the group can also be described in these terms. Not all groups possess an affective tone; members of some groups do not experience similar moods. Even so, past research indicates that a majority of groups possess an affective tone.|$|R
30|$|The {{fact that}} Alpine peri-urban {{agriculture}} {{can count on}} important actors implies <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> overturning <b>the</b> prospects with respect to what happens in cities on the plains, where agriculture can only play a passive role as its continuity is at <b>the</b> mercy <b>of</b> discretionary urban choices {{which may or may}} not be implemented, according to <b>the</b> <b>moods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|R

5|$|The {{score was}} {{composed}} by Jonathan Morali {{of the band}} Syd Matters. Inspired by modern indie folk music, the soundtrack was intended to inform <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. The music contains a blend of licensed tracks and composed pieces. Featured artists include José González, Mogwai, Breton, Amanda Palmer, Brian Viglione, Bright Eyes, Message to Bears, Local Natives, Syd Matters, Sparklehorse, Angus & Julia Stone, alt-J, Mud Flow and Foals.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{although}} Munch (Richard Belzer) is {{cynical and}} despairing over his recent break-up with ex-girlfriend Felicia, the normally-grumpy Bolander (Ned Beatty) is unusually cheerful {{as a result}} of his budding romantic relationship with Linda (Julianna Margulies), a much younger (26-year-old) waitress. Nervous about his first real date with her, Bolander asks Howard (Melissa Leo) to go on a double-date with him, along with Howard's boyfriend, prosecuting attorney Ed Danvers (Željko Ivanek). The double date goes well until a lonely Munch crashes, joins the table and ruins <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evening complaining about his romantic woes. Bolander, Munch and Linda leave together and walk to Fort McHenry, where Linda offers Munch words of encouragement. Impressed with her, Munch leaves Linda and Bolander alone, where they happily watch a fireworks show.|$|E
5|$|On January 17, 2009, Obama {{hosted a}} whistle stop train tour {{in honor of}} the 200thanniversary of the birth year of Abraham Lincoln. Obama reenacted the final part of Lincoln's 1861train tour from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Washington,D.C. to capture <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1861Springfield to Washington train tour {{traveled}} by Lincoln to his own inauguration. For his train ride to the nation's capital, Obama rode in the Georgia300, a vintage railroad car used by past presidents and the same one he used for touring Pennsylvania during his presidential primary campaign. On the tour, Obama was accompanied by his wife Michelle, their daughters Malia and Sasha, and a host of friends and guests.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{intended}} to be a full-length opera, Twice was composed between 1994 and 1996, undergoing substantial reworking before Turnage found a form with which he was satisfied. It was first performed in 1997 when it was put on both in the concert hall and in the opera house. The critical reception has been generally favourable, with several authors commenting positively about the instrumental writing and emotional impact of the work, though some critics see limitations in the libretto, find <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work too unrelenting or note the great demands that the vocal writing provides for the soloist.|$|E
5|$|The report divided Sa-iap {{history into}} four periods. Before 1937, {{the village was}} {{self-sustaining}} and used both farming and gathering for {{the overwhelming majority of}} its needs. In 1937, the Thai government allowed private companies to log the forest, destroying part of the villages' infrastructure. In 1957, the villagers entered the employ of the logging companies, causing internal and external conflict as well as increased reliance on unsustainable practices. Finally, in 1991 the villagers formed a conservation group, the Forest Lover Group, which the Chaobaan researchers agreed cut down on conflict. <b>The</b> <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> villages has returned to one of mutual assistance and traditional customs.|$|E
5|$|A Hero's Song is musically {{structured}} like a four-movement symphony, {{beginning with}} an allegro con fuoco, transitioning {{to a slow}} poco adagio lacrimosa, then including a scherzo and concluding with a coda. The piece {{is based on a}} short, energetic theme in B minor played in the violas, cellos, and basses {{at the start of the}} piece. This theme is featured in various forms throughout the first section. Following this, a slow section is marked by quiet music which symbolizes the hero's grief. It includes a funeral march, a musical form Dvořák also used in his Requiem, Stabat Mater, and Piano Quintet No. 2. The hero recovers from his grief as <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music gradually brightens and goes into B major, leading into the dance-like scherzo. Finally, the triumph of the hero is represented by the victorious coda. The piece has a run time of approximately 22 minutes.|$|E

5|$|The sea {{and ships}} have been {{depicted}} in art ranging from simple drawings on <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> huts in Lamu to seascapes by Joseph Turner and Dutch Golden Age painting. The Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai created colour prints <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea, including The Great Wave off Kanagawa. The sea {{has appeared in}} literature since Homer's Odyssey (8th century BC). The sea is a recurring theme in <b>the</b> Haiku poems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese Edo period poet Matsuo Bashō (松尾 芭蕉) (1644–1694).|$|R
5|$|Kurosawa's three {{consecutive}} movies after Seven Samurai had not managed to capture Japanese audiences {{in the way}} that that film had. <b>The</b> <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> director's work had been growing increasingly pessimistic and dark, with the possibility of redemption through personal responsibility now very much questioned, particularly in Throne of Blood and The Lower Depths. He recognized this, and deliberately aimed for a more light-hearted and entertaining film for his next production, while switching to the new widescreen format that had been gaining popularity in Japan. The resulting film, The Hidden Fortress, is an action-adventure comedy-drama about a medieval princess, her loyal general and two peasants who all need to travel through enemy lines in order to reach their home region. Released in December 1958, The Hidden Fortress became an enormous box office success in Japan and was warmly received by critics both in Japan and abroad. Today, the film is considered one of Kurosawa's most lightweight efforts, though it remains popular, not least because it is one of several major influences on George Lucas's 1977 space opera, Star Wars.|$|E
5|$|On {{leaving the}} Conservatoire in 1853, Saint-Saëns {{accepted}} {{the post of}} organist at the ancient Parisian church of Saint-Merri near the Hôtel de Ville. The parish was substantial, with 26,000 parishioners; in a typical year {{there were more than}} two hundred weddings, the organist's fees from which, together with fees for funerals and his modest basic stipend, gave Saint-Saëns a comfortable income. The organ, the work of François-Henri Clicquot, had been badly damaged {{in the aftermath of the}} French Revolution and imperfectly restored. The instrument was adequate for church services but not for the ambitious recitals that many high-profile Parisian churches offered. With enough spare time to pursue his career as a pianist and composer, Saint-Saëns composed what became his opus 2, the Symphony in E (1853). This work, with military fanfares and augmented brass and percussion sections, caught <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> times in the wake of the popular rise to power of Napoleon III and the restoration of the French Empire. The work brought the composer another first prize from the Société Sainte-Cécile.|$|E
25|$|The {{producers}} used well-known locations such as Tipitina's, Antoine's, Blaine Kern's warehouse full of Mardi Gras parade floats, and a French Quarter strip joint, {{to flesh}} out <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|E

50|$|Dellenback served four {{terms in}} the House and was {{defeated}} in the 1974 elections by liberal Democrat Jim Weaver.

25|$|Happy Feet is a jukebox musical, taking {{previously}} recorded {{songs and}} working {{them into the}} film's soundtrack to fit with <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scene or character.

25|$|The film interprets a {{story from}} <b>the</b> Uttara Kanda <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epic poem Ramayana, where Rama sends his wife, Sita, to the jungle to satisfy his subjects. Sita is never {{actually}} seen in the film, but her virtual presence is compellingly evoked in <b>the</b> <b>moods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest and the elements. The film retells the epic from a feminist perspective. It {{was shot in the}} interior tribal areas <b>of</b> Andhra Pradesh. <b>The</b> roles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epic heroes are played by Rama Chenchu tribal people, who claim lineage to the mythological Rama. Director Aravindan interweaves the Samkhya-Yoga philosophical concepts of Prakriti-Purusha bonds throughout the film.|$|R
