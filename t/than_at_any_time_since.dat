5|$|In {{the view}} of Mary Beagon, writing in The Classical Tradition in 2010:the Historia naturalis has regained its status {{to a greater extent}} <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the advent of Humanism. Work by those with {{scientific}} as well as philological expertise has resulted in improvements both to Pliny's text and to his reputation as a scientist. The essential coherence of his enterprise has also been rediscovered, and his ambitious portrayal, in all its manifestations, of 'nature, that is, life'.. is recognized as a unique cultural record of its time.|$|E
5|$|In May 2005, the band's new line-up {{embarked}} {{on a large scale}} world tour. Beginning on 10 May 2005 at the London Astoria, and finishing on 31 March 2006 in front of a sold out gig in Mexico City, Oasis played more live shows <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the Definitely Maybe tour, visiting 26 countries and headlining 113 shows for over 3.2 million people. The tour passed without any major incidents and was the band's most successful in more than a decade. The tour included sold out shows at New York's Madison Square Garden and LA's Hollywood Bowl. A rockumentary film made during the tour, entitled Lord Don't Slow Me Down directed by Dick Carruthers was released in October 2007. A second DVD included live footage from an Oasis gig in Manchester from 2 July 2005.|$|E
5|$|This {{allowed the}} Western provinces {{to achieve an}} {{economic}} revival that continued until {{the close of the}} century. It has been argued that Byzantium under the Komnenian rule was more prosperous <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the Persian invasions of the 7th century. During the 12th century, population levels rose and extensive tracts of new agricultural land were brought into production. Archaeological evidence from both Europe and Asia Minor shows a considerable increase in the size of urban settlements, together with a notable upsurge in new towns. Trade was also flourishing; the Venetians, the Genoese and others opened up the ports of the Aegean to commerce, shipping goods from the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer and Fatimid Egypt to the west and trading with the Empire via Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|This {{allowed the}} Western provinces to {{flourish}} {{in an economic}} revival that had begun {{in the time of}} his grandfather Alexios I and continued till the close of the century. Indeed, {{it has been argued that}} Byzantium in the 12th century was richer and more prosperous <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the Persian invasion during the reign of Herakleios, some five hundred years earlier. There is good evidence from this period of new construction and new churches, even in remote areas, strongly suggesting that wealth was widespread. Trade was also flourishing; it has been estimated that the population of Constantinople, the biggest commercial center of the Empire, was between half a million and one million during Manuel's reign, making it by far the largest city in Europe. A major source of Manuel's wealth was the kommerkion, a customs duty levied at Constantinople on all imports and exports. The kommerkion was stated to have collected 20,000 hyperpyra each day.|$|E

The RLAF was broken into composite squadrons to be {{stationed at the}} kingdom's main airfields—Vientiane, Pakxe, Savannakhet, and Luang Prabang. Each squadron was placed {{at the disposal of}} its local Military Region commander. Sourith was left with little say over his command. He could not prevent misuse of the transports for profit.

25|$|Outside {{these and}} similar movements, the {{establishment}} art world produced much less religious painting <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the Roman Empire, though {{many types of}} applied art for church fittings in the Gothic style were made. Commercial popular Catholic art flourished using cheaper techniques for mass-reproduction. Colour lithography {{made it possible to}} reproduce coloured images cheaply, leading to a much broader circulation of holy cards. Much of this art continued to use watered-down versions of Baroque styles. The Immaculate Heart of Mary was a new subject of the 19th century, and new apparitions at Lourdes and Fátima, as well as new saints, provided new subjects for art.|$|E
25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very worried about what was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within {{the next year or two}} of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E

500|$|Around 1508, Albrecht Dürer {{described}} {{the function of}} portraiture as [...] "preserving a person's appearance after his death". Portraits were objects of status, and served {{to ensure that the}} individual's personal success was recorded and would endure beyond his lifetime. Most portraits tended to show royalty, the upper nobility or princes of the church. The new affluence in the Burgundian Netherlands brought a wider variety of clientele, as members of the upper middle class could now afford to commission a portrait. As a result, more is known about the appearance and dress of the region's people <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the late Roman period. Portraits did not generally require lengthy sittings; typically a series of preparatory drawings were used to flesh out the final panel. Very few of these drawings survive, a notable exception being [...] for his Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati.|$|E

2500|$|The end of Mansa Ouali’s reign {{signaled}} {{a downturn in}} {{the fortunes of the}} Mali Empire. [...] Mansa Ouati, an adopted son of Mansa Djata, ruled from 1270 to 1274. During this period, Manden was racked by civil war between Ouati and another adopted brother by the name of Mansa Khalifa. Both princes were the sons of former generals and would have had sizeable forces under their command. Mansa Ouati died in 1274, and Khalifa promptly marched in to take the throne. Though his ascension meant an end to the destructive civil war, the Mali Empire was weaker <b>than</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the rise of Mansa Djata. During the despotic rule of Khalifa, the Songhai residents of Gao province were able to throw off Mandinka rule. After exhibiting cruelty and madness, courtiers had Khalifa assassinated.
