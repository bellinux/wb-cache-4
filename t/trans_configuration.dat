In <b>trans</b> <b>configuration,</b> the carbon chain extends from {{opposite sides of the}} double bond, whereas, in cis configuration, the carbon chain extends from {{the same side of the}} double bond. The trans molecule is a straighter molecule. The cis molecule is bent.|$|E
25|$|A {{side effect}} of {{incomplete}} hydrogenation having implications for human health is the isomerization {{of some of the}} remaining unsaturated carbon bonds, resulting in the trans isomers, which have been implicated in circulatory diseases including heart disease. The conversion from cis to trans bonds is favored because the <b>trans</b> <b>configuration</b> has lower energy than the natural cis one. At equilibrium, the trans/cis isomer ratio is about 2:1. Many countries and regions have introduced mandatory labeling of trans fats on food products and appealed to the industry for voluntary reductions.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} of enantiopure tryptophan or its short-chain alkylesters leads to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-'-carbolines {{in which a}} new chiral center at C-1 adopts either a cis or <b>trans</b> <b>configuration</b> towards the C-3 carboxyl group. The cis conduction is kinetically controlled, i.e. it is performed at lower temperatures. At higher temperatures the reaction becomes reversible and usually favours racemisation. 1,3-trans dominated products can be obtained with Nb-benzylated tryptophans, which are accessible by reductive amination. The benzyl group can be removed hydrogenolytically afterwards. As a rough rule, 13C NMR signals for C1 and C3 are downfield shifted in cis products relative to trans products (see steric compression effect).|$|E

25|$|The same molecule, {{containing}} {{the same number}} of atoms, with a double bond in the same location, can be either a trans or a cis fatty acid depending on the configuration of the double bond. For example, oleic acid and elaidic acid are both unsaturated fatty acids with the chemical formula C9H17C9H17O2. They both have a double bond located midway along the carbon chain. It is the configuration of this bond that sets them apart. The configuration has implications for the physical-chemical properties of the molecule. The <b>trans</b> <b>configuration</b> is straighter, while the cis configuration is noticeably kinked as {{can be seen from the}} three-dimensional representation shown above.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{intriguing}} properties of azobenzene (and derivatives) is the photoisomerization of trans and cis isomers. The two isomers can be switched with particular wavelengths of light: ultraviolet light, which corresponds to the energy gap of the π-π* (S2 state) transition, for trans-to-cis conversion, and blue light, which is equivalent to that of the n-π* (S1 state) transition, for cis-to-trans isomerization. For a variety of reasons, the cis isomer is less stable than the trans (for instance, it has a distorted configuration and is less delocalized than the <b>trans</b> <b>configuration).</b> The trans isomer is more stable by approximately 50 kJ/mol, and the barrier to isomerization in the ground state is approximately 100 kJ/mol.|$|E

The interest is largely academic, but with several potential applications. For example, combining lead nitrate and pentaethylene glycol (EO5) in a solution of acetonitrile and methanol followed by slow evaporation produces a new crystalline material [...] In the crystal structure for this compound, the EO5 chain is wrapped around the lead ion in an equatorial plane {{similar to that of}} a crown ether.

25|$|Fats contain long {{hydrocarbon}} chains, {{which can}} either be unsaturated, i.e., have double bonds, or saturated, i.e., have no double bonds. In nature, unsaturated fatty acids generally have cis as opposed to <b>trans</b> <b>configurations.</b> In food production, liquid cis-unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are hydrogenated to produce saturated fats, which have more desirable physical properties, e.g. they melt at a desirable temperature (30–40°C). Partial hydrogenation of the unsaturated fat converts some of the cis double bonds into trans double bonds by an isomerization reaction with the catalyst used for the hydrogenation, which yields a trans fat.|$|R

2500|$|In most {{naturally}} occurring unsaturated fatty acids, the hydrogen atoms {{are on the}} same side of the double bonds of the carbon chain (cis configuration— from the Latin, meaning [...] "on the same side").
