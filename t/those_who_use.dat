5|$|Aesthetics as {{a factor}} of well-being. From the early austere {{principle}} that form should strictly follow function, {{there is a growing}} sensibility that aesthetics affect the physical and emotional health of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>use</b> a building or structure. Norwegian laws concerning occupational health have for several decades emphasized access to daylight and fresh air, and it may also be that harsh climatic conditions create an added imperative for uplifting aesthetics.|$|E

5|$|English {{remains an}} active second language, with its use allowed for some {{official}} purposes under the National Language Act of 1967. In Sarawak, English is an official state language alongside Malaysian. Historically, English was {{the de facto}} administrative language, with Malay becoming predominant after the 1969 race riots (13 May Incident). Malaysian English, also known as Malaysian Standard English, {{is a form of}} English derived from British English. Malaysian English is widely used in business, along with Manglish, which is a colloquial form of English with heavy Malay, Chinese, and Tamil influences. The government discourages the use of non-standard Malay but has no power to issue compounds or fines to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>use</b> improper Malay on their advertisements.|$|E
5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication {{is used by}} individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language. People making use of AAC include individuals {{with a variety of}} congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia. Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC. An estimated 0.05% of children and young people require high technology AAC. Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking, broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan. Award-winning films such as My Left Foot and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby respectively, have brought the lives of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>use</b> AAC to a wider audience.|$|E
5|$|Cestodes (tapeworms) and digeneans (flukes) cause {{important}} {{diseases in}} humans and their livestock, and monogeneans can cause serious losses of stocks in fish farms. Schistosomiasis, {{also known as}} bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind malaria. The Carter Center estimated 200million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low mortality rate, but often is a chronic illness that can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and cognitive development of children, and {{increase the risk of}} bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which can bore through human skin. The people most at risk are <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>use</b> infected bodies of water for recreation or laundry.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the use of gait aids by ambulatory older people in a residential care setting. A cross-sectional exploration generating both qualitative and quantitative data was undertaken in a South Australian low-care population (n= 31). Demographic data were collected via case note review. Type of aid, mode of use and reasons for gait aid use were investigated via a structured face-to-face interview. Results identified four discrete groups of gait aid users in this population: <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>used</b> no aid (n= 5), <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>used</b> a stick only (n= 7), <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>used</b> a frame only (n= 13) and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>used</b> both a stick and a frame (n= 6). In total, 31 % of gait aids were self-prescribed and 33 % of frames were used inappropriately. A vast range of psychosocial and behavioural factors was described by subjects to influence gait aid type and use. These findings suggest that self-prescription by older people may indicate alternative underlying needs that may be better met by therapeutic interventions other than gait aid prescription...|$|R

25|$|Prostitution {{is often}} {{directly}} linked to low-level government corruption. Many local officials believe that encouraging prostitution in recreational business operations will bring economic benefits by developing the tourism and hospitality industries and generating {{a significant source of}} tax revenue. On occasion, police have been implicated in the running of high grade hotels where prostitution activities occur, or accepting bribes and demanding sexual favours to ignore the existence of prostitution activities. Government corruption is also involved in a more indirect form — the widespread abuse of public funds to finance consumption of sex services. Pan Suiming contends that China has a specific type of prostitution that entails a bargain between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>use</b> their power and authority in government to obtain sex and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>use</b> sex to obtain privileges.|$|E

OS-9 applications communicate with OS-9 and its drivers. This allows for a degree of hardware independence.|$|R

25|$|Sedative-hypnotics such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and the {{barbiturates}} {{are known}} for the severe physical dependence that {{they are capable of}} inducing which can result in severe withdrawal effects. This severe neuroadaptation is even more profound in high dose drug users and misusers. A high degree of tolerance often occurs in chronic benzodiazepine abusers due to the typically high doses they consume which can lead to a severe benzodiazepine dependence. The benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome seen in chronic high dose benzodiazepine abusers is similar to that seen in therapeutic low dose users but of a more severe nature. Extreme antisocial behaviors in obtaining continued supplies and severe drug-seeking behavior when withdrawals occur. The severity of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome has been described by one benzodiazepine drug misuser who stated that I'd rather withdraw off heroin any day. If I was withdrawing from benzos you could offer me a gram of heroin or just 20mg of diazepam and I'd take the diazepam every time– I've never been so frightened in my life. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>use</b> benzodiazepines intermittently are less likely to develop a dependence and withdrawal symptoms upon dose reduction or cessation of benzodiazepines than <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>use</b> benzodiazepines on a daily basis.|$|E

25|$|The most {{apparent}} distinguishing factor between alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) {{is a history}} of alcohol use or abuse.

However, in <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>use</b> alcohol, the diagnosis may just as likely be alcoholic or nonalcoholic hepatitis especially if there is concurrent obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. In this case, alcoholic and nonalcoholic hepatitis can be distinguished by the pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities; specifically, in alcoholic steatohepatitis AST>ALT with ratio of AST:ALT>2:1 while in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ALT>AST with ratio of ALT:AST>1.5:1.|$|E
40|$|The {{very high}} {{incidence}} of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in Golestan Province in northeastern Iran was suggested by studies in the 1970 s as partly due to opium use, which is not uncommon in this area, but based on limited numbers. From December 2003 to June 2007, we administered a validated structured questionnaire to 300 ESCC cases and 571 controls, matched on neighbourhood of residence, age (± 2 years), and sex. We used conditional logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) adjusted for potential confounders. Compared with <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>used</b> neither tobacco nor opium, risk of ESCC was increased in <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>used</b> tobacco only (OR, 95 % CI: 1. 70, 1. 05 - 2. 73), in <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>used</b> opium only (2. 12, 1. 21 - 3. 74), and in <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>used</b> both tobacco and opium (2. 35, 1. 50 - 3. 67). All forms of tobacco use (cigarettes, hookah, and nass) were associated with higher ESCC risk. Similarly, use of both crude opium {{and other forms of}} opium were associated with higher risk. Alcohol consumption was seen in only 2 % of the cases and 2 % of the controls, and was not associated with ESCC risk. © 2008 Cancer Research...|$|R
