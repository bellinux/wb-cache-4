40|$|Expanding {{services}} {{to some of}} the 4900 airports not currently served by scheduled air carriers can potentially ease traffic congestion and reduce flight delays at major airports. By developing new avionics and procedures for approach and landing during instrument meteorological conditions, the NASA small aircraft transportation system program demonstrated higher traffic volume general aviation operations at noncontrolled airports, without assistance from air traffic control. This paper proposes revised minimum separations and automated sequencing to help general aviation pilots maintain self-separation andmake proper approach timing decisions in a self-controlled airport environment. <b>Total</b> <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> is the measure of merit, and evaluation was conducted with multiple pilots flying simultaneously in a real-time distributed simulation environment. A rudimentary human factors analysis was also conducted to determine the benefits of shifting some spacing functions from the pilot to the onboard systems, for the purpose of reduction in pilot workload. The effect of increased automation on pilot tracking performance was also measured. Results presented in the paper show that the proposed modifications can provide significant reductions in <b>total</b> <b>holding</b> <b>time,</b> thereby avoiding potential bottlenecks and improving efficiency. Reduction in pilot workload was observed, and low-time pilots exhibited improved tracking performance.

The cryostat, one of the largest to have flown on a stratospheric payload, uses liquid helium- 4 to deliver cooling power to stages at 4. 2 and 1. 6 K. Stainless steel capillaries facilitate a high flow impedance connection between the main liquid helium tank and a smaller superfluid tank, allowing the latter to operate at 1. 6 K {{as long as there is}} liquid in the 4. 2 K main tank.

Methods: Telavancin was reconstituted with 5 % dextrose, 0. 9 % normal saline, or sterile water (15 mg/mL). Infusion solutions at 0. 6 and 8. 0 mg/mL were prepared in ViaFlex (polyvinyl chloride) IV bags (Baxter International Inc, Deerfield, Illinois) using 5 % dextrose, 0. 9 % normal saline, or lactated Ringer’s solution. Chemical stability was evaluated for up to 14 days under refrigeration and for up to 3 days under ambient conditions. Telavancin concentration and degradant levels were determined using a stability-indicating HPLC method. Solutions were subjected to microbial-challenge testing for up to 48 hours (ambient) or for up to 6 days (refrigeration). Results: All reconstituted or infused telavancin solutions met the prespecified stability acceptance criteria after 2 days under ambient and minimum 7 days under refrigeration. Following inoculation with gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms, telavancin infusion solutions stored under ambient conditions reduced or inhibited populations of all organisms up to 48 hours, except for Serratia marcescens, which exhibited growth of > 0. 5 log 10 after 12 hours. All refrigerated samples inhibited or reduced bacterial populations up to 6 days.
