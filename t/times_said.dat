5|$|Hal Rogers's brother John {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{even though he}} was in state prison serving a sentence for the rape of a woman who had shared his trailer, {{at the time of the}} murders. Police, investigating the woman's rape allegation, found evidence indicating that he had also sexually assaulted Hal's daughter Michelle, although charges involving this assault were later dropped because of her reluctance to testify. The St. Petersburg <b>Times</b> <b>said</b> that John may have planned the murder as he had visited his parents' property near Tampa a month before the murders. However, as the police established John could not have hired a professional killer, did not have accomplices, and could not have known the timing of his sister-in-law's and nieces' trip, he was dismissed as a suspect.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} {{production}} is not clear. A commercial transport ship, the Victoria, took {{the cast and crew}} from Seattle, Washington, to Nome, Alaska. There, the schooner Nanuk was rented by the studio to take the production team farther north. Originally known as the Pandora, the schooner would next be used in the 1935 production of Mutiny on the Bounty, and rerigged for the 1937 film Maid of Salem. The Nanuk acted as a mobile base of operations, and as a set for the shipboard scenes. MGM bought the schooner outright during the production. On-screen credits for the film claim filming began in April 1932, but The Hollywood Reporter said it began in July and the New York <b>Times</b> <b>said</b> June.|$|E
5|$|Casting {{began in}} October 2007, when Priyanka Chopra signed {{to play the}} lead role in the film. Chopra {{initially}} refused the role, feeling {{she would not be}} able to do it justice. Six months later, she agreed to appear in the film because of Bhandarkar's confidence in her. The media reported that Chopra was unhappy with the first draft of the film and wanted script changes before signing the film. Bhandarkar was also unhappy with the first draft and agreed to rewrite the script. Kangana Ranaut was cast as the film's second lead; she was pleased with the script and found it challenging, interesting and exciting. In December 2007, Arbaaz Khan and Arjan Bajwa were cast opposite Chopra. After confirming the principal cast, the media reported that Bhandarkar was having difficulty casting the male roles, including that of a homosexual clothing designer. Samir Soni and Harsh Chhaya were cast as the homosexual designers, and model Mugdha Godse was cast in a supporting role. According to Godse, Bhandarkar offered her a part when they were shooting a jewellery advertisement; a year later, she agreed to appear in the film. The Hindustan <b>Times</b> <b>said</b> that several models and designers played themselves, giving the film the appearance of a documentary.|$|E

5|$|On May 20, 2015, The New York Times {{reported}} that Zayat had sold breeding {{rights to the}} colt to the Ashford Stud, a division of Ireland's Coolmore Stud, but retained control over the colt and his racing career. Before the announcement, offers for American Pharoah's breeding rights reportedly exceeded $20 million. After the Belmont, Forbes magazine {{reported that}} Zayat had actually sold the breeding rights to Ashford in late 2014, long before he began his Triple Crown run, and that Zayat retained 100% of the racing rights. Forbes went on to estimate that if American Pharoah stood for a $100,000 stud fee, he could be worth $50 million. More conservative estimates placed his potential stud fee at $75,000 and his potential value at about $25 to $36 million. The New York <b>Times</b> <b>said</b> that breeding rights had been sold for $13.8 million: $9.8 million with an additional $4 million incentive if American Pharoah won the Belmont Stakes. Zayat retained an undisclosed percentage in the colt's breeding career, and explained that American Pharoah would retire from racing {{at the end of}} 2015.|$|E

25|$|The Times {{noted that}} the local {{community}} had pulled together but that the hunt appeared less newsworthy than the most minor developments {{in the search for}} Madeleine McCann.

The Daily Telegraph speculated that had Shannon been part of a middle-class family, in which articulate parents were conversant with the mechanics of mobilising a slick public awareness campaign, then more public attention would have been focused on the effort to find her.|$|E
25|$|The Interior Ministry {{estimated}} {{that at least}} 28,000 people had turned up, whilst some in the opposition claimed 120,000 protesters were in Moscow.

The infographics from RIA Novosti shows that the Sakharov Avenue can provide room for a maximum of 96,000 people at a density of 35 people per 10 sq m, or for 55,000 people at a smaller and more realistic density distribution.|$|E

25|$|The {{show was}} a number of <b>times</b> <b>said</b> to have come to its end, only to reappear. For example, in 1984, TV Times {{reported}} that series 5 would be the last. In 1985, it again seemed as if that the current series was the last one, and it was off-air (bar repeats) for three years, to reappear in 1988. This series {{appeared to be the}} last as Dennis Waterman announced his departure {{at the end of its}} run. However, after a two-and-a-half-year break, the show was back again for a further two-and-a-half-year run, which ended with the tenth series in 1994.|$|E
25|$|However, {{because of}} a poor form {{in the first two}} Tests in the series against England, and India being humiliated in the second match of that series by 10 wickets on 26 November 2012, some people have started to {{question}} his place in the Indian team. A report by The Hindustan <b>Times</b> <b>said</b> that Tendulkar had a discussion with the national chief selector Sandeep Patil, in which he said that he would leave it to the selectors to decide on his future as he is not getting any runs. This speculation, however, was later considered to be false.|$|E

25|$|The next {{sequence}} of events is even cloudier. According to business biographer James W. Campbell, Witt next became an agent for the Hudson River Steamboat Association. Railway Age claimed he was a manager, while The New York <b>Times</b> <b>said</b> {{he went to work}} for the People's Line. Joblin, however, says that Witt first captained the steamboat James Farley, a boat which traveled the Erie Canal, for an unspecified period of time. Witt then captained the Hudson River steamboat Novelty for two or three years, before being hired as a manager by the Hudson River Steamboat Association. Joblin claims he remained with the group until it dissolved in 1841.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} natural law was very {{important}} {{in the development of}} the English common law. In the struggles between Parliament and the monarch, Parliament often made reference to the Fundamental Laws of England, which were at <b>times</b> <b>said</b> to embody natural law principles since time immemorial and set limits on the power of the monarchy. According to William Blackstone, however, natural law might be useful in determining the content of the common law and in deciding cases of equity, but was not itself identical with the laws of England. Nonetheless, the implication {{of natural law}} in the common law tradition has meant that the great opponents of natural law and advocates of legal positivism, like Jeremy Bentham, have also been staunch critics of the common law.|$|E
25|$|Witt then {{traveled}} to Kentucky, {{where he was}} {{to work on the}} Louisville and Portland Canal. Sources vary considerably as to the next sequence of events. Two sources say Witt spent 18 months there, but did not finish the work and so returned to Albany. Maurice Joblin, however, says he fell ill shortly after arriving in Kentucky, and returned to Albany for 13 months of recuperation. The New York <b>Times</b> <b>said</b> Witt completed work on the canal (although it did not say how long that took) and then returned to Albany, If Witt worked on the canal, it seems unlikely that he spent much time there. The canal had been completed in December 1830, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers records almost no work done on the canal between 1830 and 1848 (when Witt is known to have been in Cleveland).|$|E
