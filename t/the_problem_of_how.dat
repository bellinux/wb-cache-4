5|$|In {{some ancient}} atlases, the constellations Serpens and Ophiuchus were {{depicted}} as two separate constellations, although more often they were shown {{as a single}} constellation. One notable figure to depict Serpens separately was Johann Bayer; thus, Serpens' stars are cataloged with separate Bayer designations from those of Ophiuchus. When Eugène Delporte established modern constellation boundaries in the 1920s, he elected to depict the two separately. However, this posed <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> to disentangle the two constellations, with Deporte deciding to split Serpens into two areas—the head and the tail—separated by the continuous Ophiuchus. These two areas became known as Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda, caput being the Latin word for head and cauda the Latin word for tail.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Second World War, Fred Hoyle worked on <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the various observed elements in the universe were produced. In 1946 he proposed that a massive star could generate the necessary thermonuclear reactions, and the nuclear reactions of heavy elements were responsible for the removal of energy necessary for a gravitational collapse to occur. The collapsing star became rotationally unstable, and produced an explosive expulsion of elements that were distributed into interstellar space. The concept that rapid nuclear fusion was the source of energy for a supernova explosion was developed by Hoyle and William Fowler during the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the chemists {{considered}} <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> plutonium {{could be}} separated from uranium when its chemical properties were not known. Working with the minute quantities of plutonium available at the Metallurgical Laboratory in 1942, a team under Charles M. Cooper developed a lanthanum fluoride process for separating uranium and plutonium, which was chosen for the pilot separation plant. A second separation process, the bismuth phosphate process, was subsequently developed by Seaborg and Stanly G. Thomson. This process worked by toggling plutonium between its +4 and +6 oxidation states in solutions of bismuth phosphate. In the former state, the plutonium was precipitated; in the latter, it stayed in solution and the other products were precipitated.|$|E
5|$|Early {{approaches}} to preserving food used variants of traditional cold boxes to solve <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> to take small quantities of products short distances to market. Thomas Moore, an engineer from Maryland, invented an early refrigerator which he patented in 1803; this involved a large, insulated wooden box, with a tin container of ice {{embedded in the}} top. This refrigerator primarily relied upon simple insulation, rather than ventilation, but the design was widely adopted by farmers and small traders, and illegal copies abounded. By the 1830s portable refrigerator chests became used in the meat trade, {{taking advantage of the}} growing supplies of ice to use ventilation to better preserve the food. By the 1840s, improved supplies and an understanding of the importance of circulating air was making a significant improvement to refrigeration in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{language}} is a philosophical problem arising from the difficulties in accurately describing God. Because God is generally conceived as incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, ordinary language cannot always apply to that entity. This makes speaking about or attributing properties to God difficult: a religious believer might simultaneously wish to describe God as good, yet also hold that God's goodness is unique and cannot be articulated by human language of goodness. This raises <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> (and whether) God can be meaningfully spoken about at all, which causes problems for religious belief since the ability to describe and talk about God is important in religious life. The French philosopher Simone Weil expressed this problem in her work Waiting for God, in which she outlined her dilemma: she was simultaneously certain of God's love and conscious {{that she could not}} adequately describe him.|$|E

5|$|Devers was an {{articulate}} {{proponent of}} the Army's now-emerging tactical doctrine of combined arms: infantry-artillery-armor-close air support. He carried a translation of a German manual on {{the components of the}} panzer division. Devers was neither the first nor the only general to embrace combined arms as the doctrinal solution to <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> best to employ tanks, but he was well-placed to act upon it. At his direction an updated, comprehensive (460 pages) Armed Force Field Manual: Tactics and Technique FM 17–10 was written, published and distributed in March 1942. A German manual on tank platoon tactics, with a foreword by Heinz Guderian, was translated into English and issued as an Armored Force publication. March 1942 saw a reorganization of the armored divisions {{in the wake of the}} 1941 maneuvers. Devers added an artillery headquarters to the armored division, and reorganized the artillery component into three battalions, each of three batteries of six M7 Priest self-propelled guns. A division trains headquarters was added to coordinate logistical activities. In a first, at Devers' insistence, a flight of light aircraft to be used for artillery spotting and reconnaissance were included in the new Table of Organization and Equipment (TO) for each division. He was a strong and early supporter of the development of the DUKW, an amphibious truck. Vannevar Bush later recalled that in the early stages of its development, Devers was the only man in the Army who fully appreciated its possibilities. Its value would be demonstrated during the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943.|$|E

40|$|Full text of {{this book}} is not {{available}} in the UHRA. This book is about <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> representation: <b>how</b> {{is it possible for}} one item to represent another? We might equally call it <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> content: <b>how</b> is it possible for an item to possess another as its content? Or <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> meaning: <b>how</b> is it possible for one item to mean another? Or <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> intentionality: <b>how</b> is it possible for one item to take another as its intentional object? Or <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> aboutness: <b>how</b> is it possible for one item to be about another? The central contention of the book is that <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> has been exacerbated, perhaps to the point of insolubility, by a critical, yet largely unnoticed, assimilation: the assimilation of representation to the category of the word. Because <b>of</b> this <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> has almost always been understood as one of relating inner to outer - of relating an inner representing item to an item that is extrinsic or exterior to {{it in such a way}} that the former can be about the latter, or have the latter as its content. Understood in this way, representation has seemed deeply problematic, even mysterious. However, I shall argue that it is not this sort <b>of</b> <b>problem</b> at all. Representation has nothing, essentially, to do with the relation between a representing item and something extrinsic to it. Accordingly, it has nothing essentially to do with the connection between the inner and the outer. The hope is that divesting <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> representation of this connection to the inner-outer divide robs it of at least some of its mystery. What was a latent problem becomes a patent problem and, therefore - maybe, just maybe - not so much <b>of</b> a <b>problem</b> at all. [Opening paragraph...|$|R
