2500|$|One of the efﬁcient DSSCs devices uses ruthenium-based {{molecular}} dye, e.g. [...] (N3), that {{is bound}} to a photoanode via carboxylate moieties. The photoanode consists of 12μm thick ﬁlm of transparent 10–20nm diameter TiO2 nanoparticles covered with a 4μm thick ﬁlm of much larger (400nm diameter) particles that scatter photons back into the <b>transparent</b> <b>ﬁlm.</b> The excited dye rapidly injects an electron into the TiO2 after light absorption. The injected electron diffuses through the sintered particle network to be collected at the front side transparent conducting oxide (TCO) electrode, while the dye is regenerated via reduction by a redox shuttle, I3/I, dissolved in a solution. Diffusion of the oxidized form of the shuttle to the counter electrode completes the circuit.|$|E

60|$|The forest grew to {{the verge}} of the precipice. A full foliaged oak and a {{luxuriant}} maple, the former still fresh with its dark green leaves, the latter making a vivid contrast with its pale yellow, purple-red, and orange hues, leaned far out over the bluff. A mighty chestnut grasped with gnarled roots deep into the broken cliff. Dainty plumes of goldenrod swayed on the brink; red berries, amber moss, and green trailing vines peeped over the edge, and every little niche and cranny sported fragile ferns and pale-faced asters. A second cliff, higher than the first, and more heavily wooded, loomed above, and over it sprayed a <b>transparent</b> <b>film</b> of water, thin as smoke, and iridescent in the sunshine. Far above where the glancing rill caressed the mossy cliff and shone like gleaming gold against the dark branches with their green and red and purple leaves, lay the faint blue of the sky.|$|E
60|$|She {{was turning}} {{her back on}} the Cage, the fore-part of the deck and the edge of the nearest forest. That great {{erection}} of enormous solid trunks, dark, rugged columns festooned with writhing creepers and steeped in gloom, was so close to the bank that by looking {{over the side of the}} ship she could see inverted in the glassy belt of water its massive and black reflection on the reflected sky that gave the impression of a clear blue abyss seen through a <b>transparent</b> <b>film.</b> And when she raised her eyes the same abysmal immobility seemed to reign over the whole sun-bathed enlargement of that lagoon which was one of the secret places of the earth. She felt strongly her isolation. She was so much the only being of her kind moving within this mystery that even to herself she looked like an apparition without rights and without defence and that must end by surrendering to those forces which seemed to her but the expression of the unconscious genius of the place. Hers was the most complete loneliness, charged with a catastrophic tension. It lay about her as though she had been set apart within a magic circle. It cut off--but it did not protect. The footsteps that she knew how to distinguish above all others on that deck were heard suddenly behind her. She did not turn her head.|$|E
