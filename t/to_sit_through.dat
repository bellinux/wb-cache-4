At the Ermineskin school in Hobbema, Alberta, he found 50% of the children had tuberculosis. At Sarcee Boarding School near Calgary, he noted that all 33 students were [...] "much below even a passable standard of health" [...] and [...] "ll but four were infected with tuberculosis". In one classroom, he found 16 ill children, many near death, who were being made <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> lessons.|$|E
500|$|Writing for NDTV, Anupama Chopra {{gave the}} film 2 out of 5, criticising the slow {{screenplay}} and artificial characters who [...] "are {{supposed to be}} unemployed, lonely, and desperately sad, but they always look like they've {{stepped out of the}} pages of a fashion magazine. Which could have been overlooked if there was any depth in their angst, but these two seem like spoilt kids playing suicide-suicide." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-News18 panned the film, calling it [...] "deathly boring [...] a challenge <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> for two reasons in particularâ€“ the film has no script to speak of, and the characters are hard to sympathize with. It lacks in terms of interesting plot and consistent characterization".|$|E
500|$|Monthly teen {{magazine}} Seventeen called Purr's bottle design [...] "cute". Miriam Lacey of Popsugar's spin-off website BellaSugar {{gave the}} perfume a favorable review {{and said it}} smelt [...] "like a fancier, less chemical-laden version" [...] of fruit-scented body sprays. In her review, Lacey also called Purr an [...] "upside-down" [...] fragrance, because unlike most perfumes which [...] "open with their prettiest notes and then end with a relatively generic bottom accord", Purr has a [...] "really nice caramel and sweet patchouli dry down that fans of Angel will adore, but to get there, you have <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> a bunch of fruity opening notes". Lacey observed that its scent only lasted about 2 hours; {{she thought it would}} be better to spray it onto your hairbrush, [...] "since the oils on your scalp will help it last longer".|$|E

5000|$|The {{film was}} very {{unsuccessful}} and was panned by critics. Shortly {{after it was}} released, the bank robber John Dillinger was at large. Hope told Walter Winchell that he had starred in the film and then added [...] "When they catch Dillinger, they're going <b>to</b> make him <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> it twice." ...|$|R
500|$|At {{a prison}} farm in Stringer, Mississippi, the prisoners {{are being made}} to prepare and fortify the prison {{for a series of}} devastating tornadoes, which are due to pass through within the next few hours. An {{argument}} breaks out between Wilson [...] "Pinker" [...] Rawls (John Diehl) and another inmate, causing Pinker to pin the other prisoner's hand to a wall with a nail. After reporting to the prison warden for the incident, Pinker is made <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> the tornado in a tiny shack, referred to as [...] "the box" [...] by the prisoners and guards. After the tornadoes pass through the county, the prisoners and guards emerge from their shelters and discover that [...] "the box" [...] has been totally destroyed. One of the prison guards later finds the prison warden's body split in half around the waist, propping his office door shut from the inside.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{both the}} film's {{explicit}} nature and award contender status, 12 Years a Slaves financial success was being watched closely. Many analysts compared the film's content to other drama films of a similar vein such as Schindler's List (1993) and The Passion of the Christ (2004), which became box office successes despite their respective subject matters. [...] "It may be a tough subject matter, but when handled well... films that are tough <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> can still be commercially successful," [...] said Phil Contrino of Boxoffice Magazine. Despite its content, the film's critical success has assisted its domestic distribution by Fox Searchlight that began with a limited released aimed primarily towards art house and African-American patrons. The film's release was gradually widened in subsequent weeks, similarly to how the studio had successfully done in years prior with films such as Black Swan and The Descendants. International release dates for 12 Years a Slave were largely delayed to early 2014 {{in order to take}} advantage of the attention created by awards seasons.|$|E
500|$|Barry Walters from Rolling Stone {{mentioned}} that I'm Going to Tell You a Secret [...] "lacks the dishy delights of the diva's 1991 Truth or Dare doc. Instead, a more worldly Madge struggles {{to become a}} less sound-bite-reliant, more sincere person." [...] Darryl Sterdan from Jam! gave it three out of five stars, saying that [...] "it still sucks <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> all that video and see almost as much of her limo as her show... For a start, how about giving us a [...] that isn't derivative and self-indulgent?" [...] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide website opined that I'm Going to Tell You a Secret would find a divided audience and how one reacted to the documentary was a reflection of how one viewed Madonna. [...] "Fans like me {{will be able to}} essentially ignore the self-serving moments and enjoy the tour elements. We'll also like the glimpse behind the curtain at Madonna on the road," [...] he added. This view was shared by a reviewer from Lexington Herald-Leader who confessed that he did not enjoy the documentary except the live performances, since he saw Madonna only as an [...] "entertainer" [...] and not as a [...] "preacher".|$|E
6000|$|The {{servants}} were honestly {{glad to see}} him, when he got home. They {{had taken}} it in turn <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> up <b>through</b> the night; knowing his regular habits, and feeling the dread that some accident had happened. Never before had they seen him so fatigued. He dropped helplessly into his chair; his gigantic body shook with shivering fits. The footman begged him to take some refreshment. [...] "Brandy, and raw eggs," [...] he said. These being brought to him, he told them to wait until he rang--and locked the door when they went out.|$|R
6000|$|But the Sea Wife's child-bearing {{is about}} done. The stock is running out, {{and the planet}} is filling up. The wives of her sons may carry on the breed, but her work is past. The {{erstwhile}} men of England are now the men of Australia, of Africa, of America. England has sent forth [...] "the best she breeds" [...] for so long, and has destroyed those that remained so fiercely, that little remains {{for her to do}} but <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down <b>through</b> the long nights and gaze at royalty on the wall.|$|R
2500|$|Hope {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Educational Pictures of New York for six short films. The first was a comedy, Going Spanish (1934). He was not happy with it, and told [...] newspaper gossip columnist Walter Winchell, [...] "When they catch [...] John Dillinger, they're going <b>to</b> make him <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> it twice." [...] Although Educational Pictures dropped his contract, he soon signed with Warner Brothers, making movies during the day and performing in Broadway shows in the evenings.|$|R
500|$|The film {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} film critics. LaRue Cook of Entertainment Weekly graded the film with a [...] "D" [...] and wrote, [...] "what {{was once a}} fresh slice of teen comedy has become a slab of stale crudeness." [...] Scott Weinberg of Moviefone, in his negative review, found the film [...] "slightly more amusing <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> than the two previous entries", in particular praising the Star Trek sexual roleplay scene as [...] "extremely effective." [...] DVD Talk's Jeffrey Robinson writes that [...] "if anything, it will bore you and leave you wondering why you wasted {{an hour and a}} half of your life." [...] Writing in JoBlo.com, Adam Quigley poked fun at the film's themes, declaring that [...] "if there's a lesson to be taken from these films, it's that women are objects, and should always be treated as such." [...] IGNs Hock Teh gave the film 5/10, writing that it [...] "stays very close to the American Pie formula," [...] while criticizing the story as [...] "devoid of anything remotely semi-compelling or even noteworthy." [...] Peter Hammond of Maxim describes American Pie Presents: Beta House as [...] "loaded with sex, laughs and raunchy fun," [...] writing that it [...] "may be the most outrageous slice of pie yet!" ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{felt that}} this episode was [...] "exciting [...] pulse-pounding", being [...] "the best episode of the season". He {{continued}} by saying that it [...] "almost made you forget the sub-par episodes [...] had <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> to get [...] ", and {{hoped it would be}} a set-up for a [...] "powerful, more consistent Volume Three". He ended his review by giving the episode 9.5 out of 10, the highest rating he had given for the second season. Stephen Lackey of Mania gave the episode an [...] "A" [...] grading, though he felt it was [...] "rushed overall" [...] and thought the virus story was not as powerful as the explosion story in season one. Jason Hughes of TV Squad also felt that the stage was set for a good third volume, which he hoped would [...] "get even darker and more dangerous". Sean Elliott of If gave the episode a [...] "B" [...] grading, saying it was an [...] "anti-climactic ending to an uninspired second season". He liked Kristen Bell's character Elle, saying she was [...] "interesting", and [...] "worth exploring and developing". He said that his favourite part of the episode was that the [...] "season [...] finally over", and that it was [...] "time to clean the slate and start with something better". Robin Brownfield of SyFy Portal called it a [...] "great finale" [...] and said that [...] "there were lots of twists [...] did not see coming". Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A-.|$|E
2500|$|Vice Principal Nero {{is likely}} a {{reference}} to the Emperor Nero, a Roman Emperor whose reign is often associated with tyranny and greed. Emperor Nero allegedly [...] "fiddled while Rome burned." [...] Emperor Nero was also famous for forcing many of his subjects <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> extended theatrical pieces created and performed by himself. This is reflected in Vice Principal Nero's awful violin recitals.|$|E

It is a perfect album, from first track to last, and how many of those really exist?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Texas Monthly {{magazine}} {{more than}} once named Harris among the [...] "Top Ten Worst Legislators." [...] In 1975, the publication called him [...] "a playboy [...] [...] [...] a double zero as a legislator [...] [...] [...] a sad case of unapplied talent; he's perfectly capable of being an outstanding member (he's not dumb), and his colleagues like him though he doesn't care enough <b>to</b> try. <b>Sits</b> <b>through</b> committee meetings looking bored and restless, {{as though he were}} daydreaming at a sermon.

6000|$|Now and again, at rare intervals, some {{glimpse into}} the inner {{sanctuary}} does reach the eyes of ordinary mortal men without; some slight accidental peep into those mysteries from whence all corruption has been so thoroughly expelled; and then, how delightfully refreshing is the sight, when, perhaps, some ex-member, hurled from his paradise like a fallen peri, reveals the secret of that pure heaven, and, in the agony of his despair, tells us all that it cost him <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> for ---- <b>through</b> those few halcyon years! ...|$|R
2500|$|In March 2001, The New York Times {{reported}} that Samaritan's Purse had [...] "blurred {{the line between}} church and state" [...] {{in the way it}} had distributed publicly funded aid to victims of the El Salvador earthquake. Residents from several villages stated they first had <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> a half-hour prayer meeting before receiving assistance. In a statement, USAID said Samaritan's Purse had not violated federal guidelines, but emphasized the need for the organization to [...] "maintain adequate and sufficient separation" [...] between prayer sessions and publicly funded activities.|$|E
2500|$|Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network {{found the}} show to be [...] "unremittingly revolting" [...] and [...] "generally not funny". [...] Anime News Network's {{individual}} episode reviews were equally critical, accusing the series more than once of having a style-over-substance approach and generally flawed, tasteless and needlessly disturbing comedy {{in spite of its}} impressive production values [...] Reviewer Gia Manry found the visuals and the writing to be substandard, ending in a 1 out of 5 score. She has also criticized Taku Takahashi's musical score for the episode, calling it [...] "terrible". Critic Hope Chapman considered {{the show to}} be a [...] "mess" [...] with a [...] "poisonous air hanging around it" [...] and thoroughly unpleasant <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>through.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Passion of the Christ {{polarized}} critics: Jim Caviezel's performance, {{the musical}} score, the sound, the makeup, and the cinematography were praised, while the film's graphic violence and alleged antisemitic undertones were {{singled out for}} criticism. The film has a [...] "rotten" [...] rating of 49% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 268 reviews with an average score of 5.9 out of 10. The consensus states [...] "The graphic details of Jesus' torture make the movie tough <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> and obscure whatever message {{it is trying to}} convey." [...] The film's Metacritic score of 47 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicates [...] "mixed or average reviews". CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare [...] "A+" [...] grade.|$|E
5000|$|Her {{mother told}} reporters outside the Old Bailey: For us, the trial {{has been a}} truly awful experience. We have had to hear Milly's name defamed in court; she has been portrayed as an unhappy, {{depressed}} young girl... the Milly we knew was a happy, vivacious, fun-loving girl. Our family life has been scrutinised and laid open for everyone to inspect. We've had to lose our right <b>to</b> privacy and <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> day after harrowing day of the trial {{in order to get}} a man convicted of this brutal murder. The lengths the system goes to protect his human rights seems so unfair compared to what we as a family have had to endure.|$|R
6000|$|I {{cursed the}} CittÃ  di Trieste and her gorgeousness, {{and looked down}} my nose. We had now two alternatives: {{to spend the night}} in Naples, or <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on all <b>through</b> the night and next morning, and arrive home, with heaven's aid, in the early afternoon. Though these long-distance trains think nothing of six hours late. But we were tired already. What we should be like after another twenty-four hours' sitting, heaven knows. And yet to {{struggle}} for a bed in a Naples hotel this night, in the rain, all the hotels being at present crammed with foreigners, that was no rosy prospect. Oh dear! ...|$|R
5000|$|The Guardian {{reviewed}} the play in its issue of 10 April 1931. The reviewer stated that, [...] "Miss Christie knows the ropes, keeps to the track, sets her Herculean protector in defence of innocence, and unmasks the real villain at eleven oâ€™clock. One {{must be something}} of a ritualist to find enchantment in such matters. Mr. Francis Sullivan makes a large, guttural, amiable sleuth of the sagacious Hercules [...] He is wise not to imitate Mr. Charles Laughton who gave us such a brilliant study of the Belgian some time ago. He makes his own portrait and does it with a competent hand." [...] The reviewer praised others in the cast by name and concluded, [...] "the company conduct themselves with a proper sense of the ceremonial involved in a detective play. But it is surely permissible to be surprised that adult people can be found in fairly large numbers <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> undismayed <b>through</b> the execution of such ritual as this." ...|$|R
2500|$|The reviews {{were not}} all positive. Vincent Canby, writing in The New York Times, {{dismissed}} The Exorcist as [...] "a chunk of elegant occultist claptrap... a practically impossible film <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>through...</b> It establishes {{a new low}} for grotesque special effects..." [...] Andrew Sarris complained that [...] "Friedkin's biggest weakness is his inability to provide enough visual information about his characters... whole passages of the movie's exposition were one long buzz of small talk and name droppings... The Exorcist succeeds on one level as an effectively excruciating entertainment, but on another, deeper level it is a thoroughly evil film." [...] Writing in Rolling Stone, Jon Landau felt the film was [...] "nothing more than a religious porn film, the gaudiest piece of shlock this side of Cecil B. DeMille (minus that gentleman's wit and ability to tell a story) ... " ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Plummer said of {{the film}} and his role that he was [...] "...a bit bored with the character. Although we worked hard {{enough to make him}} interesting, it was a bit like {{flogging}} a dead horse. And the subject matter is not mine. I mean, it can't appeal to every person in the world." [...] However, Plummer admits the film itself was well made and, despite his reservations, is proud to be associated with a film with such mass appeal. [...] "The world has seen [...] so many times. And there's a whole new generation every yearâ€”poor kidsâ€”that have <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> it [...] But it was a very well-made movie, and it's a family movie and we haven't seen a family movie, I don't think, on that scale for ages. I don't mind that. It just happened to be not my particular cup of tea." [...] His singing voice was mostly dubbed by Bill Lee.|$|E
2500|$|Even as {{the film}} {{was in the first}} weeks of its 1989 {{theatrical}} release, rumors were circulating of a wave sequence missing from the film's end. As chronicled in the 1993 laserdisc Special Edition release and later in the 2000 DVD, the pressure to cut the film's running time stemmed from both distribution concerns and Industrial Light & Magic's then-inability to complete the required sequences. From the distributor's perspective, the looming three-hour length limited the number of times the film could be shown each day, assuming that audiences would be willing <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> the entire film, though 1990's Dances with Wolves would shatter both industry-held notions. Further, test audience screenings revealed a surprisingly mixed reaction to the sequences as they appeared in their unfinished form; in post-screening surveys, they dominated both the [...] "Scenes I liked most" [...] and [...] "Scenes I liked least" [...] fields. Contrary to speculation, studio meddling was not the cause of the shortened length; Cameron held final cut as long {{as the film}} met a running time of roughly two hours and 15 minutes. He later noted, [...] "Ironically, the studio brass were horrified when I said I was cutting the wave." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Albuquerque", an eleven-minute [...] "hard-driving rock narrative", is a style {{parody of}} The Rugburns, {{and tells the}} fictional life of Yankovic and his various adventures {{in the town of}} Albuquerque, New Mexico. Yankovic {{originally}} wrote the song to [...] "annoy people for 12 minutes". He felt that it would be an [...] "odyssey" [...] for fans <b>to</b> successfully <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> it, and so it was placed {{at the end of the}} album. Instead, to Yankovic's surprise, the song has become a fan favorite. [...] "My Baby's in Love with Eddie Vedder" [...] is a style parody of zydeco about a man's frustration that his girlfriend is obsessed with Eddie Vedder, the lead singer for the grunge band Pearl Jam. Musically, the song is in the style of zydeco. [...] "Truck Driving Song", a detailed account of a truck-driver working, while at the same time worrying about their clothing and makeup, is a style parody of truck-driving country. While writing the song, Yankovic listened to C.W. McCall for inspiration.|$|R
