This study compared the reproducibility of mesiodistal total <b>tooth</b> <b>widths</b> and arch perimeter values, on plaster casts, given by the DigiGraph Workstation and by digital calipers. Forty-seven sets of plaster casts of Southern Chinese children (mean age 12. 5 years) comprised the sample. Arch perimeter was measured using calipers in six segments from the distal of the first permanent molar to its antimere in each arch. The total mesiodistal <b>widths</b> of all <b>teeth,</b> excluding second and third molars, were also measured. The difference between the available arch perimeter and the total <b>tooth</b> <b>widths</b> was taken as the arch perimeter discrepancy. Sonic digitization of the study casts was completed according to instructions of the DigiGraph software. Paired t-tests and F-tests were {{used to compare the}} two methods. Compared with manual measurement, there was an over-estimation of the total <b>tooth</b> <b>widths</b> by 1 mm in the mandible and 0. 5 mm in the maxilla, and an arch perimeter discrepancy of 1. 6 mm in the mandible and 0. 4 mm in the maxilla when using the sonic method.

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is to provide a simple but quite rigorous analytical method for computing the cogging torque in surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous machines. It relies on the fact that the magnetic energy variation due to the presence of a slot on the stator side of the airgap can be expressed on the basis of the airgap field the magnets should produce on the stator side of the airgap in absence of slotting, simply by taking the square of the value of this field at the position corresponding to the center of the slot and multiplying it by a coefficient k 0 which depends on the square of the slot opening. The cogging torque formula which can be deduced from this expression of the energy variation due to a slot is simple and well suited for inclusion in an optimization process aiming at the minimization of this torque during the design of SMPM synchronous machines with equal <b>tooth</b> <b>widths</b> as well as of machines with unequal <b>tooth</b> <b>widths...</b>|$|R

However the most commonly used methods of space analysis are based on data developed on Caucasian populations. In order to provide more accurate local data we set out to develop a formula for predicting the widths of un-erupted canines and premolars for a Ugandan population and to compare the predicted <b>widths</b> of the <b>teeth</b> from this formula with those obtained from Moyers’ tables, and Tanaka and Johnston’s equations. Methods Dental casts were prepared using mandibular and maxillary arch impressions of 220 children (85 boys/ 135 girls) aged 12 – 17 [*]years recruited from schools in Kampala, Uganda. The mesio-distal width of the mandibular incisors, mandibular and maxillary canines and premolars were measured with a pair of digital calipers. Based on regression analysis, predictive equations were derived and the findings were compared with those presented in Moyers’ probability tables, and Tanaka and Johnston’s equations. Results There were no statistically significant differences between the <b>tooth</b> <b>widths</b> predicted by our equations and those from Moyers’ probability tables at the 65 th and 75 th percentile probabilities for the girls and at 75 th level in boys in the mandibular arch. While in the maxillary arch no statistically significant differences at the 75 th and 95 th levels were noted in girls. There were statistically significant differences between predicted tooth sizes using equations from the present study and those predicted from the Tanaka and Johnston regression equations. Conclusions In this Ugandan population, Moyers’ probability tables could be used to predict <b>tooth</b> <b>widths</b> at specific percentile probabilities, but generally, Tanaka and Johnston technique tends to overestimate the <b>tooth</b> <b>widths.</b> </p...|$|R

30|$|The {{etiology}} of tooth agenesis {{is considered to}} involve the disturbance of dental development by genetic factors, environmental factors, or a combination thereof [10 – 16]. Tooth agenesis is often accompanied by other tooth anomalies [17 – 24]. Many researchers have reported that tooth size in patients with tooth agenesis is often smaller than in patients without tooth agenesis [19 – 24]. Gunor et al. reported that mesiodistal <b>tooth</b> <b>width</b> in patients with two or more CMT was significantly smaller than that of patients without CMT. Furthermore, reduction of mesiodistal <b>tooth</b> <b>width</b> was more severe in patients with six or more CMT {{than it was in}} patients with two to five [22]. Similarly, Brook et al. reported that there was a positive correlation between the degree of reduction of mesiodistal <b>tooth</b> <b>width</b> and the number of CMT [20]. However, these results were derived from Turkish and Caucasian populations—no reported studies have investigated the relationship between CMT number and mesiodistal <b>tooth</b> <b>width</b> in Japanese subjects.

40|$|The {{standard}} <b>tooth</b> <b>width</b> ratio tables currently do {{not provide}} an overall indication of the final interdigitation of teeth. To provide a comprehensive analysis of inter-arch <b>tooth</b> <b>width</b> discrepancy, this study has developed a combination of cumulative percentage <b>tooth</b> <b>width</b> ratios and a method to visually determine the harmony between maxillary and mandibular tooth widths. Mesiodistal tooth widths from the first permanent molar to the corresponding first permanent molar were measured from 60 sets of pretreatment study models which were selected consecutively. Cumulative percentage ratios relating mandibular teeth to maxillary teeth were calculated utilising the mesiodistal <b>tooth</b> <b>width</b> measurements. The 13 mean cumulative percentage ratios developed {{in this study were}} plotted on graph paper showing plus and minus two standard deviations from the mean. These ratios provide a standard from which cumulative percentage ratios obtained from any new case may be compared graphically. Deviations from the mean cumulative percentage ratios are immediately recognised. No simple graphical method of assessment on the final interdigitation of anterior and posterior teeth has previously been devised. The graphical analysis of <b>tooth</b> <b>width</b> discrepancy is invaluable as an aid in localising any <b>tooth</b> <b>width</b> discrepancy and ensuring that incompatible maxillary-to-mandibular tooth widths are recognised prior to orthodontic treatment...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{prediction}} equation for estimating the total widths of the mandibular permanent canines and premolars (TCPW) using the total widths of the mandibular first permanent molars and incisors (TWFMI). The sample comprised 288 mandibular dental casts of orthodontic Patients (106 males and 182 females, average age 13. 8 and 14. 4 years, respectively). A digital vernier calliper was used to measure the mesiodistal <b>tooth</b> <b>widths</b> from the mandibular right to the left first permanent molar. An independent t-test was used to determine any gender difference and a multiple linear regression equation to predict TCPW using TWFMI. A paired t-test was used to compare the actual and predicted values of the canines and premolars. The results showed a statistically significant difference (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) between the mesiodistal <b>tooth</b> <b>widths</b> of males and females. A moderate correlation and determination coefficient between TCPW and TWFMI was found (r = 0. 64 to r = 0. 67 and r(2) = 0. 41 to r(2) = 0. 44, respectively).
