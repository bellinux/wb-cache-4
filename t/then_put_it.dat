An old woman saved him and a few others. As mark of great reverence, which in Mongolia is considered a highly sacred mountain of spiritual significance, and to the sun above, he offered his respects to {{the spirits of the}} mountain around him, sprayed milk into the air and sprinkled it on the earth. He removed his girdle strap, unwinding it from his outfit, and <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> around his neck. Symbolically by this act he surrendered his Mongolian man's pride and expressed his submission to the gods.|$|E

Wearing the mask pushed up onto the forehead while {{out of the water}} or on the surface increases the risk of the mask falling or being knocked off.|$|E

The newspaper did this but <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> back, whereupon Mosley sought an injunction to prevent the re-publication of the video. However, this was denied as Justice David Eady concluded that the video was too widely available for the injunction to serve any purpose. In July 2008, Justice Eady granted a permanent injunction restraining News Group Newspapers from showing the video.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} semi–main {{event of the}} evening, La Sociedad member Jeff Jarrett {{challenged}} El Zorro for the AAA Mega Championship. Like the other matches involving TNA workers, the match was refereed by La Sociedads own referee, Hijo del Tirantes, who showed bias towards Jarrett throughout the match. On several occasions Jarrett attempted to get El Zorro to submit with an ankle lock, the signature hold of his TNA rival Kurt Angle, but when {{he realized he was}} not going to succeed in his attempt, he took advantage of a distraction from his wife Karen and smashed El Zorro with his signature guitar, but to his surprise, only managed to get a two count out of the following pinfall. Jarrett then took a hold of El Zorro's kendo stick, hit him with it and <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> across his throat and performed his finishing maneuver The Stroke to become the new AAA Mega Champion and the first ever American to hold the title. Jarrett left the ring as fans in attendance started to fill it with bottles.|$|E
25|$|The City of Chicago {{is looking}} into a plan for an express train that would take tourists, locals, and other {{travelers}} from downtown Chicago to O'Hare International Airport in about 20 minutes, which is half {{the time it takes}} on the City's Blue Line. If an express train does get built, one-time tickets would likely cost around $30 to $35. Less expensive monthly passes and family discounts might also become available. The City will look for a private company to cover construction costs and operate the system, but it's likely public money would go into building stations at the airport and downtown if the project moves ahead. The city says an engineering firm will spend the next 10 months evaluating potential routes, drafting designs and coming up with a construction timeline and cost estimate, <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> out for bid in 2017. In the early 1990s, the idea of a 20-minute O'Hare express train service has been proposed. Some plans included bypass tracks on the CTA Blue Line that run {{down the middle of the}} Kennedy Expressway as well as use of a Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way near the Kennedy. However no plans were ever materialized.|$|E

500|$|In late 1927 {{or early}} 1928, there {{arrived at the}} Warsaw Customs Office from Germany a package that, {{according}} to the accompanying declaration, was supposed to contain radio equipment. [...] The German firm's representative strenuously demanded that the package be returned to Germany even before going through customs, {{as it had been}} shipped with other equipment by mistake. [...] His insistent demands alerted the customs officials, who notified the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau, which took a keen interest in new developments in radio technology. [...] And since it happened to be a Saturday afternoon, the Bureau's experts had ample time to look into the matter. [...] They carefully opened the box and found that it did not, in fact, contain radio equipment but a cipher machine.

Rindt <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> back into the box with a note telling her to keep it until she changed her mind, which she did upon receiving the package, later explaining: [...] "I like men who know what they want." [...] The couple moved to Switzerland, near Begnins, where they built a house together. The Rindts had one daughter, Natasha, who was two years old at the time of her father's death. Nina Rindt married twice more after Rindt's death, first Philip Martyn, with whom she had another daughter, and then Alexander Hood, 4th Viscount Bridport, making her Lady Nina Hood Bridport. The couple had a son, Anthony. Their daughter Natasha later worked with Bernie Ecclestone for several years after he had taken over the commercial rights of Formula One.|$|E

500|$|Brown was {{regarded}} as a cautious starter who was reluctant to use his full array of strokes. He had an upright stance and was known for his trademark leg glancing and placement of the ball. He hooked occasionally and scored the majority of his off-side runs with the cut shot. Johnnie Moyes said that [...] "even when slow, he never wearied, as some do, because his style was cultured and free from jarring faults". Moyes felt that Brown's superior record on English soil was a result of the crowd attitude, which was more respectful. At Australian grounds, impatient spectators who disliked Brown's cautious batting frequently heckled him, blaming Brown for delaying Bradman's arrival to the crease. [...] Moyes felt that the more serene English gallery allowed Brown to play to his game plan without hastening to placate impatient spectators. [...] "A placid chap was Brown, and he liked to play in peaceful surroundings. When on the job he was as emotionless as a stoic." [...] Moyes said that Brown was [...] "always cool and thoughtful, he preferred finesse to force". The English journalist Neville Cardus commented [...] "His cricket is perpetually keeping an appointment leisurely with moments to spare. Does the bat have an engagement this over with a half-volley? Very well, <b>then,</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> down in the book. We'll be there for it. Plenty of time." [...] Bradman also noted Brown's ability to quickly get into position to play the ball, writing [...] "One hallmark of good batting is that the player appears to have plenty of time in which to play his strokes. Bill Brown was an outstanding case of one who never seemed to be in a hurry for any stroke." [...] Ray Robinson said that Brown was [...] "the most serene batsman I ever saw play for Australia". Robinson said that [...] "for artistry, Brown's leg-glancing could be mentioned in the same breath as Archie Jackson's". Brown's placid nature extended to his observations of modern cricket—he disliked the emotional displays made by contemporary players.|$|E

2500|$|... {{written in}} about 1660. This account is {{particularly}} noteworthy as {{he refers to}} football by its correct name in English and {{is the first to}} describe the following: modern goals and a pitch ("a close that has a gate at either end. The gates are called Goals"), tactics ("leaving some of their best players to guard the goal"), scoring ("they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win") and the way teams were selected ("the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness"). He is the first to describe a law of football: [...] "They often break one another's shins when two meet and strike both together against the ball, and therefore there is a law that they must not strike higher than the ball". His account of the ball itself is also very informative: [...] "They blow a strong bladder and tie the neck of it as fast as they can, and <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into the skin of a bull's cod and sew it fast in". He adds: [...] "The harder the ball is blown, the better it flies. They used to put quicksilver into it sometimes to keep it from lying still". His book includes the first (basic) diagram illustrating a football pitch.|$|E
2500|$|Southern Pacific 4449 is {{the only}} {{surviving}} example of Southern Pacific Railroad's (SP) (today Union Pacific) GS-4 class of steam locomotives. There is one other GS-class locomotive surviving, {{but it is a}} GS-6. The locomotive is a streamlined 4-8-4 (Northern) type steam locomotive. GS is abbreviated from [...] "Golden State", a nickname for California (where the locomotive was operated in regular service), or [...] "General Service". The locomotive was built by Lima Locomotive Works in Lima, Ohio, for SP in May 1941; it received the red-and-orange [...] "Daylight" [...] paint scheme for the passenger trains of the same name which it hauled for most of its service career. No. 4449 was retired from revenue service in 1956 and put into storage. In 1958 it was donated, by the railroad, to the City of Portland, who <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on static display in Oaks Amusement Park, where it remained until 1974. It was restored to operation for use in the American Freedom Train, which toured the 48 contiguous United States for the American Bicentennial celebrations. [...] Since then, 4449 has been operated in excursion service throughout the continental US; its operations are based at the Oregon Rail Heritage Center in Portland, where it is maintained by a group of dedicated volunteers called Friends of SP 4449. In 1983, a poll of Trains magazine readers chose the 4449 as the most popular locomotive in the nation.|$|E
