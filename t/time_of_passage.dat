2500|$|The Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act (introduced as Arizona Senate Bill 1070 {{and thus}} often {{referred}} to simply as Arizona SB1070) is a 2010 legislative Act in the U.S. state of Arizona that at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> in 2010 was the broadest and strictest anti-illegal immigration measure passed in Arizona.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} an {{overlooked}} dimension <b>of</b> <b>time</b> judgments, namely subjective judgments {{of the speed}} <b>of</b> <b>time</b> passage: how fast time is judged as passing. It has examined how people make judgments of the speed <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>passage</b> and what factors influence people’s judgments of the speed <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>passage.</b> Chapter 2 first unravels the cognitive processes that underlie judgments of the speed <b>of</b> <b>time</b> passage: the more {{attention is paid to}} non-temporal information, the faster time is judged as passing; it also disentangles judgments of the speed <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>passage</b> from duration judgments (i. e., judgments about how long time lasted), demonstrating that it is not reliable to infer judgments of the speed <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>passage</b> from duration judgments. Chapter 3 builds upon the previous chapter and examines two factors: presentation speed of stimuli and comparison, which might interfere with the role of attentional processes in judging the speed <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>passage.</b> It shows that both presentation speed of stimuli and comparison could influence people’s judgments of the speed <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>passage,</b> but they could not replace the role of attentional processes: when either presentation speed of stimuli or comparison is missing, people can always rely on attentional processes to make judgments of the speed <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>passage.</b> Chapter 4 examines the influence of unpredictability on people’s judgments of the speed <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>passage.</b> It shows that time is judged as passing faster when people are in both temporal unpredictable situations where they cannot predict when the events would happen, and in content unpredictable situations where they cannot predict what events would happen next. Chapter 5 examines the influence of spatial directions of movements on judgments of the speed <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>passage.</b> It shows the effect that people judge time as passing faster for the left-to-right movements than the right-to-left movements. This effect was also replicated with Farsi speakers. Overall, the work in this thesis shows original empirical evidence about how people make judgments of the speed <b>of</b> <b>time</b> passage; specifically, it discloses the underlying mechanism of judgments of the speed <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>passage</b> (i. e., attentional processes) as well as the factors that influence people’s judgments of the speed <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>passage</b> such as presentation speed of stimuli, comparison, unpredictability and spatial directions of movements...|$|R

50|$|Special {{cases of}} the {{sun-synchronous}} orbit are the noon/midnight orbit, where the local mean solar <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> for equatorial longitudes is around noon or midnight, and the dawn/dusk orbit, where the local mean solar <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> for equatorial longitudes is around sunrise or sunset, so that the satellite rides the terminator between day and night. Riding the terminator is useful for active radar satellites as the satellites' solar panels can always see the Sun, without being shadowed by the Earth. It is also useful for some satellites with passive instruments that need to limit the Sun's influence on the measurements, as {{it is possible to}} always point the instruments towards the night side of the Earth. The dawn/dusk orbit has been used for solar observing scientific satellites such as Yohkoh, TRACE, Hinode and PROBA2, affording them a nearly continuous view of the Sun.|$|E
