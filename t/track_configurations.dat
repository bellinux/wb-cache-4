5|$|Stations {{along the}} three-tracked {{stretch of the}} Culver Line are being renovated until early 2018 (excluding Ditmas Avenue and the {{northbound}} platform of Avenue X, which were rehabilitated in 2015–2016), with the center track being used to bypass closed stations. The Coney Island-bound platforms were rehabiliated between June 7, 2016 and May 1, 2017 (May 8 for Avenue U and Avenue X). During {{the second phase of}} the project, beginning on May 22, 2017, the Manhattan-bound platforms will be closed between Avenue U and 18th Avenue until early 2018. Even after the rehabilitation, though, peak-direction express service between Church Avenue and Kings Highway will not be restored due to limitations caused by current <b>track</b> <b>configurations,</b> as the switches at Kings Highway previously used were removed in the 1990s. The interlocking at Kings Highway is scheduled to be modernized as part of the 2020–2024 MTA Capital Plan, and the modernization could include the reinstallation of the necessary track switches.|$|E

2500|$|During Daytona Beach Bike Week, a supercross {{track is}} built between pit {{road and the}} tri-oval section of the track. [...] Historically the track has used more sand than dirt, {{providing}} unique challenges to riders.

2500|$|The {{majority}} of streetcar routes operate in mixed traffic, generally reflecting the original <b>track</b> <b>configurations</b> {{dating from the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries. [...] However, newer trackage has largely been established within dedicated rights-of-way, {{in order to allow}} streetcars to operate with fewer disruptions due to delays caused by automobile traffic. [...] Most of the system's dedicated rights-of-way operate within the median of existing streets, separated from general traffic by raised curbs and controlled by specialized traffic signals at intersections. [...] Queen streetcars have operated on such a right-of-way along the Queensway between Humber and Sunnyside loops since 1957. [...] Since the 1990s, dedicated rights-of-way have been opened downtown along Queens Quay, Spadina Avenue, St. Clair Avenue West, and Fleet Street.|$|E
2500|$|During the reconstruction, {{the field}} and <b>track</b> <b>configurations</b> were shifted several degrees counterclockwise, to move the stadium away from Frederick Street. The {{evidence}} for {{this can be seen}} by examining photos of the tunnel entrance at the east end of the field, which used to be exactly on the long axis of the track. A replica of the original concrete arch bearing the name [...] "Kezar Stadium" [...] was built {{on the west side of}} the stadium as a tribute to the original structure. A plaque of NFL Hall of Famer Bob St. Clair, a San Francisco native who played 11 pro seasons (1953–63) with the 49ers, plus his high school (S. F. Poly) and most of his college career (USF) at Kezar Stadium, is built into the replica arch.|$|E
50|$|<b>Track</b> <b>configurations</b> {{become more}} {{complicated}} where lines meet (at the Spadina-St. George-Museum-Bay-Yonge junction and at Sheppard-Yonge), {{and at the}} entrances to subway yards.|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{changes from}} the 1970s saw a {{significant}} number of stations on the line moved or turned into island platform stations (to be compatible with the double <b>track,</b> dual-gauge <b>track</b> <b>configuration</b> between East Perth and Midland).|$|R
50|$|This was {{the final}} time CART would race at this <b>track</b> <b>configuration</b> in Houston; the series would return in 2006 using a {{temporary}} circuit at NRG Park, while the IndyCar Series would race in Houston from 2013-2014.|$|R
50|$|Power is {{transmitted}} from the engine to the rear axle by a chain. Both engine and axle sprockets are removable; their ratio must be adapted to the <b>track</b> <b>configuration</b> {{in order to get}} the most from the engine.|$|R
50|$|The Collector's Edition for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 {{added another}} 5 new cars, twelve new circuits, and sprint and {{checkpoint}} <b>track</b> <b>configurations.</b> Also included were specially tuned versions of ten existing cars, plus 35 exclusive vinyls for adding a unique visual style.|$|E

50|$|The road {{course is}} almost {{perfectly}} flat and runs clockwise. Two <b>track</b> <b>configurations</b> are possible. One includes a hard chicane {{at the end}} of the front straight and involves 12 turns at length of 1.967 miles (3.17 km). Without the chicane, the track has nine turns and a lap length of 1.915 miles (3.08 km).|$|E
30|$|Even an {{interaction}} between not-worn wheels and rails generates dynamic forces, due to the <b>track</b> <b>configuration</b> itself (e.g., the sleepers are supporting the rail with a specific spacing; they do not represent a uniform base for the vehicle riding).|$|R

50|$|GeoTrax {{train set}} layouts come in beginner, intermediate, {{advanced}} and expert levels, and are built around playset Rail, Construction, Rescue, Elevation and Air and Sea focal point toys. GeoTrax's appeal {{is due in}} part to the number of possible <b>track</b> <b>configurations</b> that can be created with interchangeable track and playsets. GeoTrax is known for its Snap-Lock track which can be locked together or taken apart to create a multitude of <b>track</b> <b>configurations.</b> Layouts can be set up flat or using elevated tracks, and can incorporate curves, ramps and bridges. Some adult assembly is needed to build the track layouts. The assembly process sometimes involves using a Phillips screwdriver and snapping tracks together to create multiple play levels. Users can learn to build a number of prescribed layouts by visiting the GeoTrax site which shows pieces and sets used in each layout and printable pictures of the layouts.|$|E
50|$|The roadcourse {{is able to}} be used in {{multiple}} configurations. It can be run in either clockwise or counter clockwise directions, with 2 configurations each. The longer course is 1.4 mi and includes a tight set of esses and a chicane. The shorter course deletes the esses and chicane and is 1.1 mi. The result is effectively 4 different <b>track</b> <b>configurations</b> for racing.|$|E
5000|$|Rolling ball sculptures, {{typically}} {{marketed as}} [...] "marble runs" [...] are commonly sold as children's toys worldwide. Unlike professional kinetic sculptures, however, their commercial counterparts are typically {{made of wood}} or plastic and feature small, interlocking pieces that can generate {{a large number of}} <b>track</b> <b>configurations.</b> More complicated add-ons, such as jumps, loops, trampolines, xylophone ramps and electronic triggers are also typical with more complex sets.|$|E
50|$|There is a bootleg CD {{available}} of the July 1986 <b>track</b> <b>configuration,</b> {{which comes}} with a color pencil sketch made by Susannah Melvoin as cover, which was a concept for the prospective album sleeve.

50|$|A level {{junction}} (or in the United Kingdom a flat crossing) is {{a railway}} junction {{that has a}} <b>track</b> <b>configuration</b> in which merging or crossing railroad lines provide track connections with each other that require trains to cross over in front of opposing traffic at grade (i.e. on the level).|$|R
50|$|Like {{other games}} in the Family series, players choose {{a member of a}} family, {{including}} a mother, father, son (Billy), and daughter (Sarah), to play as. The game sees players racing slot cars against an opponent across four circuits, each with several <b>track</b> <b>configurations.</b> The game features a number of slot cars to choose from, each with different attributes in acceleration, speed and grip, with additional cars unlockable as they progress through the game.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally, various <b>track</b> <b>configurations</b> require {{minor changes}} in the {{distance}} of the race. The 2007 race at Monmouth Park was held at a distance of 1 mile 70 yards (1673 m) instead of the normal distance of 1 mi. The 2015 Breeders' Cup was held at Keeneland, which does not regularly hold 1-mile dirt races. To get the proper distance, the starting gate was set 70 yards (64 m) in front of the one-mile pole, where the timer would start, and the finishing line was set at the track's alternate finish line at the 1⁄16 mile pole. Thus the race was slightly longer than a mile for the horses.|$|E
50|$|The {{new field}} was soon unable to {{accommodate}} the athletics program. Since the football, baseball, and <b>track</b> <b>configurations</b> overlapped each other due {{the angle of the}} field and the reservoir, the Athletic Association had to spend money on contractors to build and disassemble the bleachers for each season. The effort soon plunged the Alumni Advisory Committee into debt. However, the Committee devised a permanent solution: purchase the reservoir, enlarge the grounds, and build a field house. At commencement in 1904, the field house cornerstone was laid and work on the new field was completed towards the end of 1905 for a total cost of $9,000.|$|E
50|$|Further {{problems}} {{occurred with}} the approval of the ETCS system. So in the course of test and acceptance runs, software errors and the need to adjust the <b>track</b> <b>configuration</b> data have been observed. After the elimination of the errors, authorisation to use the ETCS system could be given on 10 September 2015.|$|R
50|$|The TV {{motoring}} programme Fifth Gear regularly {{used the}} Anglesey circuit for the 'Shoot Out' {{segment of the}} show. Since the new <b>track</b> <b>configuration,</b> Fifth Gear has opted to use the Coastal layout. The Coastal layout {{appears to be the}} most popular among track day enthusiasts because of the difficult downhill corkscrew segment.|$|R

50|$|Winding in {{the infield}} of the {{high-speed}} tri-oval, {{there is a}} regular road race track for automobile and motorbike racing, using various <b>track</b> <b>configurations</b> up to roughly 4,500 m. The stands around the tri-oval have a capacity of 120,000, while the huge main grandstands have 25,000 seats, and unlike many circuits, the entire circuit {{can be seen from}} the main grandstand. Also a test oval with long straights and steeply banked corners is located next to the track. All tracks can be connected to form an 11 km long endurance racing course, but this option was not yet used for a major event, but as a test track capability.|$|E

50|$|The Astrodome held several {{motorsports}} events {{throughout its}} lifetime. The AMA Grand National Championship held events starting in 1968 and running for 18 years, utilizing the Short Track and TT Steeplechase <b>track</b> <b>configurations</b> in their visits. The AMA Supercross Championship {{held its first}} ever indoor Supercross at the Astrodome in 1974, won by Jim Pomeroy. In the mid-1980s the Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group held several Stadium Off-Road Racing Series events, showcasing such drivers as Ivan Stewart, Robby Gordon, and Walker Evans. Beginning in the early 1980s, both TNT Motorsports and the United States Hot Rod Association held events showcasing mud bogging, truck and tractor pulling, and monster trucks in the Astrodome. After a buy-out of TNT Motorsports, the USHRA continued holding events that would later transform into the current Monster Jam events.|$|E

50|$|According to Croatian news reports, {{the cause}} of the {{derailment}} was slippery fire retardant that was just sprayed on a steep downhill section of the track, a normal practice in extreme summer heat but executed improperly using a new chemical. With brakes ineffective, the train gained a speed higher than the <b>track</b> <b>configuration</b> could handle and derailed.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 season FIA {{approved}} <b>track</b> <b>configuration</b> changes. Turn 10 chicane, {{known as}} 'Singapore Sling' was removed {{and replaced with}} a single-apex left-hand bend. Corner entry speed is about 40 km/h faster. To compensate for the increase in speed, an extra layer of TecPro barriers lines {{the end of the}} Turn 10 run-off as an added safety measure.|$|R
