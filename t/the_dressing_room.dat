5|$|According to O'Brien, only he, Woodfull, the masseur (who was deaf), Alan Kippax, {{and former}} Australian Test players Jack Ryder and Ernie Jones were present when the {{incident}} took place, {{but most of}} the Australian team were watching the match from a balcony adjoining <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>room</b> from where they {{would have been able to}} hear the confrontation. O'Brien claimed that he went outside and told the group what had happened; around twenty people were present.|$|E
5|$|Boston police {{attempted}} to arrest Richard in <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>room</b> {{after the game}} ended, but were turned back by Canadiens players who barred the door, preventing any arrest. Bruins management finally persuaded the officers to leave with a promise that the NHL would handle the issue. Richard was never arrested for the incident. He was instead sent to the hospital by team doctors after complaining of headaches and stomach pains.|$|E
5|$|Gardiner's health {{continued}} {{to be an issue}} throughout the 1934 NHL playoffs. On March 29, 1934 in a playoff game against the Montreal Maroons Gardiner had a shutout as the Black Hawks won 3–0; though he was named first star as the best player of the game, Gardiner was in extreme pain during the entire game with a fever of 102 Fahrenheit and was attended to by a doctor in <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>room</b> during intermissions.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, Stein {{appeared}} to be in good spirits; during the warm-up, Wales goalkeeper Neville Southall found that the Scottish fans in the crowd kept all of the balls he and Eddie Niedzwiecki were using. On returning to <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>room</b> he spoke about it to Stein, who then went out onto the pitch and gestured to the fans to return all the balls. Prior to the start he took his place in the dugout and the game kicked off without incident.|$|E

In 2008, New Zealand played Munster at Thomond Park. Before the match, Munster's four New Zealanders challenged their opponents by performing a haka before the All Blacks started theirs. On the same tour, Wales responded by silently refusing to move after New Zealand's haka, and the two teams simply {{stared at each other}} until the referee forced them to start the game.|$|E

However, he remains held in the highest esteem by the fans; he was granted the Freedom of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne on 2 March 2005.|$|E
5|$|The final whistle blew {{with the}} score {{remaining}} at 1–1. The Scottish players began celebrating their achievement with the estimated 12,000 Scotland fans {{who had made}} the trip to Cardiff, but were immediately aware that something was not right on the touchline, although with the level of commotion they were unclear precisely what was happening. It was Alex Ferguson, who went onto the pitch after the final whistle, who began informing some of the players of Stein's collapse, news of which began to filter through to all of them {{as they made their way}} back to <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
5|$|A further {{tour of the}} US {{was planned}} for December 1976, {{but it had to}} be {{cancelled}} when, on 23 November, Brian Robertson suffered a hand injury when trying to protect fellow Glaswegian, singer and friend Frankie Miller in a fracas at the Speakeasy Club in London. Miller had been jamming onstage with the reggae band Gonzalez, but had been drunk, offending Gonzalez guitarist Gordon Hunte. Hunte attacked Miller with a bottle in <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>room,</b> and Robertson intervened, suffering artery and nerve damage to his hand. Robertson subsequently broke Hunte's leg, broke the collarbone of another man, and headbutted another, before being hit on the head with a bottle, rendering him unconscious.|$|E

The scene is witnessed by the Waif, who returns to tell Jaqen H'ghar of Arya's failure. Jaqen gives the Waif permission to kill Arya, {{on the condition that}} Arya doesn't suffer. Meanwhile, Arya retrieves her sword, Needle, from the rocks where she had hidden it and takes it to her room.|$|E
5|$|As {{the video}} begins, Rihanna is walking towards a {{dressing}} room mirror while {{preparing for a}} show. This is intercut with scenes of Rihanna with her boyfriend in a restaurant. While they talk to each other, Rihanna's boyfriend leaves the table and is absent for some time, during which Rihanna watches the other tables. One diner writes a note and gives it to a waiter, who passes it to Rihanna, who reads and quickly hides the note as her boyfriend returns to the table. Rihanna starts to sing the song's lyrics while she leaves <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>room</b> and approaches the stage, where she continues singing while a man plays a piano on the stage. The arena is empty and it appears as though Rihanna is rehearsing.|$|E
5|$|During the 1932–33 season Gardiner {{began to}} develop a tonsil {{infection}} that drained his strength. While he initially kept the infection private, Gardiner made his condition public on December 23, 1932. Even though he was ill, Gardiner played the next night in Toronto. Though his fifty-five saves were the deciding factor in the Black Hawks win and his performance was so good that both league President Frank Calder and Maple Leafs star forward Charlie Conacher praised him, he was so sick he would collapse on <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>room</b> floor in between periods with a fever of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit; after the game Gardiner was rushed to a local hospital. This was the first notable symptom of Gardiner's health issues.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} since Jock Stein's death, some, {{including}} Alex Ferguson, {{have said that they}} noticed changes in him {{in the days and weeks}} prior to the game against Wales. The night before, Stein had invited Ferguson and Andy Roxburgh to his hotel room, where he reminisced with them about his time in football, something that he rarely if ever did; he also persuaded his family not to make the trip to Cardiff to watch the game. Further, Ferguson noted that, during the half-time interval, Stein did not dominate <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>room</b> in the way he normally did, while Gordon Strachan found it difficult to understand precisely what Stein was saying during his team-talk. However, Strachan came to accept that the final decision Stein made, to replace him with Davie Cooper, was the correct one given Cooper's subsequent impact on the game.|$|E
5|$|Once half-time was reached, it {{was clear}} that Scotland, and Jim Leighton in particular, were in difficulty. In <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>room,</b> Leighton {{admitted}} that the reason he had missed the cross {{at the end of the}} first half, which led to the last-ditch save at the feet of Mark Hughes, was that he was shortsighted and had lost one of his contact lenses. Not only that, but he did not have a spare pair with him. Leighton had not been forthcoming about his eyesight because of fears that it might harm his career. As a consequence, that the goalkeeper even needed lenses was something that his team mates, Alex Ferguson (who was also Leighton's club manager at Aberdeen) or, most importantly, Jock Stein did not know.|$|E
5|$|Randy Savage, who {{continued}} to sell his supposedly injured leg, lost the title to Ric Flair at a television taping on September 1, 1992 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. During the match Flair received help not only from Mr Perfect but also from newcomer Razor Ramon, igniting a feud between Savage and Ramon. Bret Hart claimed in a 2014 interview that WWF owner Vince McMahon had worked out the title-change match with Flair and Savage before hand, {{and that he was}} angry when they returned to <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>room</b> after the match because they had failed to do much of what was agreed upon. McMahon was that angry that he actually made them go straight back out and re-do the whole match. After producing much the same match that they had immediately prior, McMahon allegedly threw his headset onto the table and stormed off in frustration.|$|E

5|$|Reports were sketchy {{initially}} – television pictures {{broadcast on}} ITV showed Stein, {{who appeared to}} be both conscious and alert, being carried down the tunnel by a number of police officers, with commentator Brian Moore speculating that he had been overcome with the emotion of the result. BBC Radio commentator Peter Jones (who had no access to the television pictures and was relying on information from other people in the press box) also speculated that the tension of the result and the night had led to Stein's collapse. Willie Miller, the Scottish captain on the night in the absence of Graeme Souness, was informed by Martin Tyler of ITV Sport during the post-match interview that Stein had collapsed, with Alex Ferguson entering <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>room</b> to tell them that Stein had suffered a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the Second Test also {{affected}} the career paths of other players. England's inability to cut down the Australians resulted in the dropping of three of their bowlersWright, Laker and Coxonafter the Lord's Test. Coxon's debut was his only Test match, something believed to be caused more by off-field events than sporting merit. There was a story that he punched Comptonwhom he disliked and considered self-importantin <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>room,</b> but Coxon always denied this. However, there was certainly an altercation and Coxon was never selected again. The match was the last ever Test for Brown, who had struggled out of position in the middle-order, scoring 73 runs at 24.33 in three Test innings during the season. He had scored centuries on his previous Test outings at Lord's in 1934 and 1938, but the third visit {{proved to be the}} end of his international career.|$|E
