2500|$|... the Nazi entourage in Raiders of the Lost Ark, upon {{arriving}} at their island base, begin an elaborate {{trek to the}} centre of the island, with soldiers holding aloft National Socialist standards. The procession is somewhat ostentatious given the climate, prompting the black-dressed Gestapo agent to remove his hat and wipe <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow.|$|E
60|$|Saunders wiped <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow on his {{buckskin}} sleeve.|$|E
60|$|Petru wiped <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow {{with his}} gauntlet, {{and with a}} desperate effort rose to his feet.|$|E
60|$|Trent stood upright, wiped <b>the</b> dank <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{forehead}} and gazed around him fiercely, and upwards at that lurid little patch of blue sky.|$|R
6000|$|... "Huh! couldn't see us for smoke," [...] Hootchinoo Bill chuckled, flirting <b>the</b> {{stinging}} <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{brow and}} glancing swiftly {{back along the}} way they had come.|$|R
6000|$|There is silence. He {{takes out}} his {{handkerchief}} and mops <b>the</b> [...] <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> face. Going back blindly to his table, sits [...] down, and stares blankly at his lunch.|$|R
60|$|Hinchcliffe wiped <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{brow and}} drew breath. It {{was the first}} vehicle that he had passed, and I sympathised with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I 'm gettin' plumb dried out," [...] Billy announced, mopping <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> sunburned forehead. [...] "What d'ye say we {{head for}} the coast?" ...|$|E
60|$|He threw {{aside the}} great armful of yellow flowers, {{took off his}} cap, and wiped <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow. The sickle dangled loose in his hand.|$|E
60|$|The {{answer was}} a long time coming; at last the man nodded an assent, <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> pouring <b>from</b> <b>his</b> purple face. She had set him thinking; her victory was sure.|$|R
60|$|It {{was hard}} work, and <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> poured <b>from</b> <b>his</b> face {{and down his}} chin. But he kept at it, noting at each turn how close the steeds and the elegant turnout were drawing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I serve {{under the}} {{standard}} of his gracious Majesty, George III," [...] returned the priest, wiping <b>the</b> cold <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow. [...] "But really {{the idea of being}} scalped has a strong tendency to unman a new-beginner, like myself." ...|$|R
60|$|Mulhall wiped <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> eyes. All were {{sweating}} profusely {{and breathing}} hard. There was no {{ice in the}} drink that was served, and whiskey and absinthe went down lukewarm.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is papa," [...] said Jane, as {{they got}} to the gate. Then they waited for a few minutes till Mr. Crawley came up, very hot, wiping <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> forehead.|$|E
60|$|Kells purled out a {{suspended}} breath and he flung <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow. There was about him, {{perhaps more than}} the others, a dark realization of how close the call had been for Pearce.|$|E
6000|$|... "It'd {{be worth}} {{a lot to the}} feller who can show me {{a way out of this}} mess," [...] said Buell, mopping <b>the</b> beads of <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! {{of course}} you are right, Heigham, quite right," [...] ejaculated his host, faintly, wiping <b>the</b> cold <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow; [...] "it is nothing but the moonlight. How ridiculous of me! I suppose I am a little out of sorts--liver wrong. Give me some whisky, there's a good fellow, and I'll drink damnation to all the shadows and the trees that throw them. Ha, ha, ha!" ...|$|R
60|$|Dr Macphail was a timid man. He {{had never}} been able to get used to the hurtling of the shells over the trenches, and when he was {{operating}} in an advanced dressing-station <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> poured <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow and dimmed his spectacles in the effort he made to control his unsteady hand. He shuddered' a little as he looked at the missionary.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I think I'll take one," [...] said Wallenstein, wiping <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> face. His eye {{caught the}} shadow of Koho {{on the floor and}} {{followed}} it up to the old chief himself. [...] "Hello! who's this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All ready?" [...] {{the captain}} asked the engineer, a Portuguese half-caste, whose head and {{shoulders}} protruded from the small hatch just for'ard of the cabin, and who wiped <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> face {{with a bunch of}} greasy waste.|$|E
60|$|But Smoke's {{reply was}} a bantering laugh. He held {{on down the}} little valley, {{occasionally}} wiping <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> forehead, the while his feet crushed through ripe mountain raspberries and delicate ferns that grew beside patches of sun-sheltered ice.|$|E
6000|$|... 'As {{soon as he}} {{was dead}} the Emperor turned to me, and when he had wiped away <b>the</b> bright <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow with a little napkin of purfled and purple silk, he said to me, [...] "Art thou a prophet, that I may not harm thee, or the son of a prophet, that I can do thee no hurt? I pray thee leave my city to-night, for while thou art in it I am no longer its lord." ...|$|R
60|$|Leo {{dropped back}} to the earth again, and saw the great star Aldebaran, that {{is set in the}} {{forehead}} of the Bull, blazing very near to the earth. When he came up to it he saw that his brother, the Bull, yoked to a countryman's plough, was toiling through a wet rice-field with his head bent down, and <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> streaming <b>from</b> <b>his</b> flanks. <b>The</b> countryman was urging him forward with a goad.|$|R
6000|$|... 'As {{soon as the}} man {{was dead}} the Emperor turned to me, {{and when he had}} wiped away <b>the</b> bright <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow with a little napkin of purfled and purple silk, he said to me, [...] "Art thou a prophet, that I may not harm thee, or the son of a prophet, that I can do thee no hurt? I pray thee leave my city to-night, for while thou art in it I am no longer its lord." ...|$|R
60|$|Casey {{leaned on}} his spade while he wiped <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow and {{regarded}} his ally McDermott. Between them yawned a grave {{they had been}} digging and near at hand lay a long, quiet form wrapped in old canvas.|$|E
60|$|They had a stiff {{climb to}} get to the top again. It took them a quarter of an hour. When he got on to the level grass, he threw off his cap, wiped <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> forehead, and sighed.|$|E
60|$|Crouching {{there for}} a moment longer, a man bereft of {{movement}} and of reason, stood O'Moy, conscious only of pain, in an agony of mind and heart that at one and the same time froze his blood and drew <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow.|$|E
60|$|Although he {{had been}} unable to see him drop the poison into the cup, a glance at Hafela told Owen that it was there; for though he kept his face under control, he could not prevent <b>his</b> hands <b>from</b> {{twitching}} or <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> starting upon <b>his</b> brow and breast.|$|R
60|$|It was windless there. The sun {{fell through}} the white mist with undiminished fury, and the {{fragrant}} hay sent up a breath that was hot as an oven draught. Grant was a powerful man, {{and there was something}} majestic in his action as he rolled the huge flakes of hay through <b>the</b> door. <b>The</b> <b>sweat</b> poured <b>from</b> <b>his</b> face like rain, and he was forced to draw his dripping sleeve across his face to clear away <b>the</b> blinding <b>sweat</b> that poured into his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{returned}} to his figures and worked them over. <b>The</b> <b>sweat</b> poured <b>from</b> <b>his</b> face. He chewed his mustache, his lips, and his pencil, staring at the figures as a man might at a ghost. Suddenly, with a fierce, muscular outburst, he crumpled the scribbled paper in his fist and crushed it under foot. Mr. Konig grinned vindictively and turned away, while Captain Davenport leaned against the cabin and for half an hour spoke no word, contenting himself with gazing to leeward with an expression of musing hopelessness on his face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course it's all right, {{always was}} all right," [...] Nishikanta bragged, as he wiped <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{face and neck}} and looked with the others after the departing whale. [...] "You're a fine brave lot, you are, losing your goat to a fish." ...|$|E
6000|$|Rowan wiped <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> forehead. His {{breathing}} was becoming difficult. Already the excitement was affecting him. [...] "But {{it was there}} on that night!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "He took off his coat a few minutes before, and I saw him feel it in the lining." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt," [...] replied Dave, {{lifting his}} face and wiping <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow. [...] "I knew that from the first, but I was so dazed by Snap's going over to Holderness that I couldn't keep my wits, and I didn't mark Snap edging over till too late." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quitting {{the pump}} at last, {{with the rest}} of his band, the Lakeman went forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping <b>the</b> profuse <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know not; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate {{commanded}} him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.|$|R
60|$|Vergine santa! What a consternation was his. He {{must have}} missed Mariani {{early in the}} day, for he took no measure, asked no {{questions}} that might confirm or refute the thing I announced. His face grew livid, and his knees loosened. He sank on to a chair and mopped <b>the</b> cold <b>sweat</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow with his great brown hand. No thought had he now for {{the eyes of his}} officers or their opinions. Fear, icy and horrid, such fear as in his time he had inspired in a thousand hearts was now possessed of his. Sweet indeed was the flavour of my vengeance.|$|R
60|$|By his side, {{his elbows}} {{resting on the}} altar rails, his eyes fixed upon the beaming armour that he would wear in battle, knelt Wulf, his brother--a mighty man, a knight of knights, fearless, noble, open-hearted; such a one as any woman might well love. And he also loved Rosamund. Of this Godwin was sure. And, oh! did not Rosamund love Wulf? Bitter jealousy seized upon his vitals. Yes; even then and there, black envy got hold of Godwin, and rent him so sore that, cold as was <b>the</b> place, <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> poured <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brow and body.|$|R
