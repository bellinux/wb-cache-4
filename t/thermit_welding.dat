50|$|Exothermic welding, {{also known}} as {{exothermic}} bonding, thermite welding (TW), and <b>thermit</b> <b>welding,</b> is a welding process that employs molten metal to permanently join the conductors. The process employs an exothermic reaction of a thermite composition to heat the metal, and requires no external source of heat or current. The chemical reaction that produces the heat is an aluminothermic reaction between aluminium powder and a metal oxide.|$|E
50|$|The long rails {{could be}} {{conveyed}} to site {{by a special}} train, and unloaded on to the ground (by chaining the end in position and pulling the train out from underneath the rails). The long rails had to be welded together (or to adjacent track) using a site welding process; and, after initial experimentation, the proprietary <b>Thermit</b> <b>welding</b> process was used. This was an alumino-thermic process in which a powder 'portion' was ignited; the aluminium was the fuel and a metallurgically appropriate composition of molten steel descended into {{the gap between the}} rail ends, contained in refractory moulds.|$|E

Beside <b>thermit</b> <b>welding</b> as a older joint process for that job (since 1895.) it is mentioned flash welding as a modern joining technique interesting {{from the point of}} cost efficiency. In a case of maintance tasks it is necessary to caunt arc welding processes and <b>thermit</b> <b>welding,</b> too.

5000|$|In 1970, {{construction}} {{began on}} {{an extension of}} the Hamersley railway from Wombat Junction, just north of Tom Price, to a second mine, at Paraburdoo, about 64 km south west of Tom Price. Engineering design and construction management for the extension was undertaken by Minenco; the contractors were a joint venture known as Morrison-Knudsen-Mannix-Oman (MKMO). The Paraburdoo extension incorporated a number of design improvements. In particular, the track was made from heavier, [...] rail sections, which were flashbutt and <b>thermit</b> <b>welded</b> into continuous rails, and attached by pandrol clips to timber sleepers. Construction was completed in March 1972, and the first official Paraburdoo train ran on 5 May 1972.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{new style}} of {{emergency}} welding, named manual SHS welding,was introduced. By this technique, metal materials could be welded {{on the condition}} of no electricity, no gas and no equipments. In this paper, the mechanism of manual SHS welding has been illustrated, the effect of <b>thermit</b> on <b>welding</b> and the microstructure of the welded joint have been studied, and the mechanical properties have been tested. Results showed that the combustion velocity of the combustion welding rod became higher when the content of (CuO+Al) thermit increased. The suitable (CuO+Al) content is 60 %wt ~ 80 %wt. The tested 45 steel plates were one-side welded with back formation. Microstructure analysis indicated that there are three zones in the welded joint, which are heat affected zone, fusion zone and weld metal. The weld metal and the 45 steel plates were combined metallurgically. The weld metal was copper based alloy. EDS patterns showed that there was diffusion of Cu, Fe and Ni in the three zones. The fracture of the weld joint is a typical ductile fracture. The tensile strength of the joints reached 400 MPa and the impact absorbed energy was about 35 J, which meet the requirement of mechanical properties for emergency welding. Manual SHS welding is an effective welding method for emergency maintenance in battlefield and outside field...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. War-broken parts can be {{repaired}} quickly without {{electricity and gas}} in the wild by use of the <b>thermit</b> <b>welding</b> technology, so it is of great significance to study on welded quality of <b>thermit</b> <b>welding</b> parts for its military application. As the crack resistance of welded parts is an important target to estimate the welded performance, crack resistance test and microstructure analysis have been conducted on test specimens made of Q 235 welded parts. Results showed that as the crack ratio was less than 20 % in the Y-groove crack test, the crack propagation would not occur in the practical welding structure and that the crack resistance of welded joints could meet the welded demand...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. War-broken parts {{could be}} {{repaired}} quickly without power and {{gas in the}} field by using the <b>thermit</b> <b>welding</b> technology. In this paper, experimental and structural analysis on strength of <b>thermit</b> <b>welding</b> was made. According to orthogonal experiments, the pressure mode was found to influence tensile stress most, then the warm-up temperature and the welding line clearance. By quadratic general revolving combination design, the mathematics equation indicating the relation of welding tensile stress, warm-up temperature, pressing time and welding line clearance was obtained, and the optimized welding parameters to achieve the best tensile strength were decided as well. By further analysis on microstructures and fractures of welded seam, fusion zone and HAZ of thermit steel, conclusion was made that it was of vital significance to adopt welding-after-peening method for improving {{the strength of the}} welded seam...|$|E
