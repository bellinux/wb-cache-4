He recorded 13 points in 22 post-season games, {{including the first}} two goals in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Helping the Red Wings defeat the Penguins in six games, the victory made Samuelsson {{a member of the}} Triple Gold Club, having won gold medals at the Winter Olympics and World Championships two years prior.

5|$|Agile, quick, creative, and powerful, Balotelli is {{credited}} with pace, flair, physical strength, technical ability, and an eye for goal; his height, elevation and physique allow him to excel in the air, and {{he is capable of}} scoring with his head or with either foot, from both inside or outside the area. Although he normally plays in a central role as a main striker, he is a versatile forward, who is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, and has also been deployed as a winger or as a second striker. Despite his talent, however, he has been criticized by managers, <b>teammates,</b> <b>and</b> the media for a perceived poor and immature attitude at times, as well as his for his poor movement and work-rate, inconsistency, mentality, and volatile temperament and arrogant behaviour on the pitch, which has often led him to pick up unnecessary bookings throughout his career. Balotelli has also been accused of diving, and is thus regarded by <b>teammates</b> <b>and</b> the media as a promising but undisciplined player. Due to his powerful shot, Balotelli is also a set-piece specialist, and is {{regarded as one of the}} best penalty kick takers in world football, a view backed by his former Manchester City goalkeeping teammate Joe Hart. Balotelli missed his first competitive penalty against Napoli on 22 September 2013 when it was saved by Pepe Reina; the first time in 22 attempts as a professional.|$|E

5|$|Giordano {{was named}} the 19th captain in Flames history on September 20, 2013, as he succeeded Jarome Iginla, who was traded late in the 2012–13 season. Giordano was praised by his <b>teammates</b> <b>and</b> coaches staff for both his long tenure with the {{franchise}} and for his playing style: Giordano played in all situations for the Flames, {{was one of the}} hardest workers on the team and was willing to sacrifice himself to block a shot or defend his teammates. Head coach Bob Hartley praised Giordano's influence on his teammates as the rebuilding Flames team established an identity as a squad which was noted across the league for its work ethic.|$|E
5|$|Meetings between Manchester United and Arsenal {{prior to}} this one were often eventful encounters. In Alex Ferguson's first match against Arsenal at Old Trafford in January 1987, his team prevailed with a 2–0 win to end the visitors' 22-match unbeaten run in all competitions.

Following the contest, Selänne was saluted by fans, <b>teammates</b> <b>and</b> opponents alike, and took a final lap around the rink.|$|E
5|$|The media hype he has {{encountered}} has led Tavares to remain guarded when {{speaking to the}} media, while his <b>teammates</b> <b>and</b> family attempt to shield him from the spotlight where they can. However, Tavares {{is regarded as a}} natural leader on the ice, and a player who puts his team first. The Oshawa Generals named Tavares their team captain in 2008, while he also served as the alternate captain with the Canadian junior team in 2009.|$|E

5|$|When Joe Nieuwendyk {{refused to}} report to the Flames prior to the 1995 season, they named Fleury interim captain. The title was made {{permanent}} when Nieuwendyk was traded in December. Fleury was reluctant to assume the captaincy, but did so out of loyalty to the team and because there was nobody else capable of taking on the role. He relinquished it two seasons later after deciding that it was harming his play and affecting his relationship with his <b>teammates</b> <b>and</b> coach Pierre Pagé.|$|E
5|$|As {{a player}} {{representative}} to the NHL Players Association since 1990, Linden was responsible for being the contact between his <b>teammates</b> <b>and</b> the NHLPA. He saw the experience {{as a chance to}} be involved in the business side of the sport. In light of this service, Linden was elected President of the NHLPA in June 1998. Consequently, Linden was actively involved in negotiations with Gary Bettman and the NHL on a new CBA that ended the 2004–05 lockout. This included a final meeting in January 2005 between Linden and Harley Hotchkiss, the chairman of the NHL Board of Governors, in an attempt to avoid losing the NHL season. Despite this meeting, a result was not found in time to keep the NHL from cancelling the 2004–05 season.|$|E
5|$|At Payback, the Shield {{ended their}} feud with Evolution by {{defeating}} {{them in a}} six-man No Holds Barred elimination match.

Later that night, Seth Rollins turned on his Shield <b>teammates</b> <b>and</b> allied himself with Triple H's Authority, eventually winning the Money in the Bank briefcase. The remaining members of the Shield, Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns, went their separate ways {{by the end of}} June. Cesaro ended his association with Paul Heyman in July on the night of Brock Lesnar's return.
