40|$|In earlier work, a {{three-dimensional}} cloud model {{was used to}} simulate {{the interaction between the}} sea-breeze front (SBF) and front-parallel horizontal convective rolls (HCRs), resulting in the SBF system-atically encountering roll updrafts and downdrafts as it progressed inland. Interestingly, deep convection was spawned above an HCR updraft ahead of the SBF as the front approached, well before the inevitable front–roll merger. Ostensibly, both the sea-breeze and roll circulations were required for deep convection to be present in this case at all because convection was entirely absent when either phenomenon was removed. Further analysis reveals why both circulations were necessary yet not sufficient for the excitation of deep convection in this case. The sea-breeze circulation (SBC) made its upstream (inland) environment more favorable for convection by bringing about persistent if gentle lifting over an extended region stretching well ahead of the SBF. This persistent ascent established a moist and cool <b>tongue</b> <b>of</b> <b>air,</b> manifested by a visible and/or subvisible cloud feature termed the cloud shelf emanating ahead of the front. Though this lifting moistened and destabilized the environment, the roll’s direct and indirect effects on this moist tongue were also required. The former consisted of a moisture plume lofted by the roll updraft, and the latter consisted of obstacle effect gravity waves generated as the roll drafts penetrated through the top of the boundary layer, into the SBC-associated offshore flow farther aloft. These provided the missing spark, which led to rapid growth of cumulus above the roll updraft, drawing first from air located above the boundary layer. Once established, deep convection above the roll updraft modulated cloudiness above the approaching SBF, at first suppressing it but subsequently assuring its reestablishment and eventual growth into deep convection, again prior to the front–roll merger. This resulted from the influence of gravity waves excited owing to heating and cooling within the roll cloud. 1...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{attention}} has been given to the potential negative impacts of the Saharan air layer (SAL) in recent years. Researchers recently raised questions about the negative impacts of Dunion and Velden and other studies in terms of storms that reached at least tropical storm strength and suggested that the SAL was an intrinsic part of the tropical cyclone environment for both storms that weaken after formation and those that intensify. Braun also suggested that several incorrect assumptions underlie many of the studies on the negative impacts of the SAL, including assumptions that most low-to-midlevel dry tropical air is SAL air, that the SAL is dry throughout its depth, and that the proximity of the SAL to storms struggling to intensify implies some role in that struggle. The recent paper by Reale et al. (RL 1) {{is an example of the}} problems inherent in some of these assumptions. In their paper, RL 1 analyze a simulation from the Global Earth Observing System (GEOS- 5) global model and describe an extensive tongue of warm, dry air that stretches southward from at least 30 deg N (the northern limit of their plots) and wraps into a low pressure system during the period 26 - 29 August 2006, suppressing convection and possibly development of the African easterly wave associated with that low pressure system. They attributed the warm, dry tongue to the SAL (i. e., heating of the air mass during passage over the Sahara and radiative warming of the dust layer). Whether it was their intention, the implication is that this entire feature is due solely to the SAL and not to other possible sources of dry air or warmth. In addition, they suggested that a cool <b>tongue</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> in the boundary layer located directly beneath the elevated warm, dry tongue (forming a thermal dipole) was possibly the result of reduced solar radiation caused by an overlying dust layer. They stated that "the cool anomaly in the lower levels does not have any plausible explanation relying only on transport. " In this comment, evidence from satellite and global meteorological analyses is presented that casts considerable doubt upon RL 1 s interpretation of the GEOS- 5 forecasts and their conclusion that the results implied a negative role of the SAL. We show that the major portion of the warm, dry air aloft was located in a nearly dust-free slot between two Saharan dust outbreaks, had a significant source from the midlatitudes (> 30 N), and was likely driven by strong subsidence warming and drying. In addition, when wind fields are examined in a reference frame moving with the wave, National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) global meteorological analyses suggest that the cool tongue in the boundary layer can be readily explained by transport of cooler air from higher latitudes. At the very least, it offers a plausible alternative explanation for the cool tongue that does not rely on radiative impacts of the dust...|$|E

40|$|Trajectory {{calculations}} using horizontal winds {{from the}} U. K. Meteorological Office data assimilation system and vertical velocities from a radiation calculation {{are used to}} simulate the three-dimensional motion <b>of</b> <b>air</b> through the stratospheric polar vortex for Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) winters since {{the launch of the}} Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS). Throughout the winter, air from the upper stratosphere moves poleward and descends into the middle stratosphere. In the SH lower to middle stratosphere, strongest descent occurs {{near the edge of the}} polar vortex, with that edge defined by mixing characteristics. The NH shows a similar pattern in late winter, but in early winter strongest descent is near the center of the vortex, except when wave activity is particularly strong. Strong barriers to latitudinal mixing exist above about 420 K throughout the winter. Below this, the polar night jet is weak in early winter, so air descending below that level mixes between polar and middle latitudes. In late winter, parcels descend less and the polar night jet moves downward, so there is less latitudinal mixing. The degree of mixing in the lower stratosphere thus depends strongly on the position and evolution of the polar night jet and on the amount of descent experienced by the air parcels; these characteristics show considerable interannual variability in both hemispheres. The computed trajectories provide a three-dimensional picture <b>of</b> <b>air</b> motion during the final warming. Large <b>tongues</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> are drawn off the vortex and stretched into increasingly long and narrow tongues extending into low latitudes. This vortex erosion process proceeds more rapidly in the NH than in he SH.

40|$|ABSTRACT-A {{situation}} {{that led to}} rapid development of strong winds over the Northern Persian Gulf is compared with a similar situation in which gales were anticipated but did not occur.

In the second case, deep convec-tion did not occur, and the cold air did not move southward.

In the remainder of the bioregions, peak lightning activity coincides with summer weather conditions conducive for fire ignition and spread.|$|R

50|$|On September 14, a Tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) cell located {{approximately}} 05 {{degrees to}} the west of the system caused strong subsidence prompting the JTWC to downgrade Roke to a tropical depression. However, because of favorable atmospheric conditions, Roke strengthened again, and the JTWC re-upgraded Roke to a tropical storm. On September 16, the previously exposed LLCC was being re-consolidated with convection and Roke continued to strengthen again. Despite the upper low over the LLCC, Roke remained a warm-core tropical cyclone and the JTWC predicted that there were chances of Roke become a hybrid or a subtropical storm. On continuing its west-northwestward movement, Roke eventually slowed down to under 2 kn with a <b>tongue</b> <b>of</b> cloud-free <b>air</b> entering the LLCC from the west side. Due to a mid-level warm anomaly, the subtropical transition was taking place at an unusually slow rate. Later, that day, Roke turned to the southwest and slowed down with convection consolidating and deepening near the LLCC. What began as a monsoonal depression with an elongated and weak LLCC was now more stronger and organized. Also, the TUTT cell above the system started weakening and data from an ASCAT scatterometer pass revealed that the storm started to strengthen and the JTWC no longer expected a subtropical transition.|$|R
40|$|The main {{findings}} of this research project have been the following: (1) {{there is a significant}} feedback from the stratosphere on tropospheric dynamics, and (2) a detailed analysis of the interaction between tropical and polar wave breaking in controlling stratospheric mixing. Two papers are were written and are included. The first paper is titled, "A New Perspective on the Dynamical Link Between the Stratosphere and Troposphere. " Atmospheric processes of tropospheric origin can perturb the stratosphere, but direct feedback in the opposite direction is usually assumed to be negligible, despite the troposphere's sensitivity to changes in the release of wave activity into the stratosphere. Here, however, we present evidence that such a feedback exists and can be significant. We find that if the wintertime Arctic polar stratospheric vortex is distorted, either by waves propagating upward from the troposphere or by eastward-travelling stratospheric waves, then there is a concomitant redistribution of stratospheric potential vorticity that induces perturbations in key meteorological fields in the upper troposphere. The feedback is large despite the much greater mass of the troposphere: it can account for up to half of the geopotential height anomaly at the tropopause. Although the relative strength of the feedback is partly due to a cancellation between contributions to these anomalies from lower altitudes, our results imply that stratospheric dynamics and its feedback on the troposphere are more significant for climate modelling and data assimilation than was previously assumed. The second article is titled "Diagnosing the Polar Excitation of Subtropical Waves in the Stratosphere". The poleward migration <b>of</b> planetary scale <b>tongues</b> <b>of</b> subtropical <b>air</b> has often been associated with intense polar vortex disturbances in the stratosphere. This question of vortex influence is reexamined from a potential vorticity (PV) perspective. Anomalous geopotential height and wind fields associated solely with vortex PV anomalies are derived and their impact on the stratospheric subtropical circulation is evaluated. Combined PV inversion and Contour Advection (CA) calculations indicate that transient large scale disturbances of the polar vortex do have a far reaching impact that extends beyond the midlatitude surf zone {{all the way to the}} subtropics. This vortex influence is clearly non-local so that even simple wave 2 distortions that leave the vortex well confined within the midlatitudes are observed to excite subtropical waves. Treating subtropical PV as active tracers also showed that upon entrainment, these large scale <b>tongues</b> <b>of</b> low PV <b>air</b> also influenced the dynamics of their own poleward migration...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{an episode of}} a stratospheric intrusion into the free troposphere over Europe followed by a long-range transport of ozone from the North American boundary layer. Observational data showed the presence <b>of</b> a thin <b>tongue</b> <b>of</b> stratospheric <b>air</b> in the free troposphere for at least 36 hours. This filament was found in data from two ozone soundings and was recorded continuously for 26 hours by a high-resolution ozone lidar.

Trajectory, particle dispersion model, and potential vorticity analyses confirmed the stratospheric nature <b>of</b> the <b>tongue.</b> In the lidar data, following the intrusion, pockets of elevated ozone concentrations (80 - 100 ppb) {{were found in the}} free troposphere close to the tropopause. The low potential vorticity values and high water vapor content in these ozone-rich pockets and trajectory analyses suggest that the ozone was photochemically produced in the boundary layer over eastern North America, followed by rapid uplifting in a warm conveyor belt over the Atlantic Ocean ahead of a frontal system. This was confirmed by ozone and water vapor measurements aboard commercial airliners crossing the warm conveyor belt. The air mass trajectories in both the stratospheric intrusion and the warm conveyor belt were tightly bundled, emphasizing the importance of the coherency of airstreams for long-range ozone transport...|$|R
