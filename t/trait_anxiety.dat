40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Death {{anxiety is}} a concept that has {{received}} little empirical attention in the organizational psychology literature. Research has found that <b>trait</b> death <b>anxiety</b> is associated with burnout, and lower work engagement in jobs with high mortality cues. However, most people do not work in jobs where they are constantly reminded of death.

Using terror management theory as a foundation, I predicted that those higher in <b>trait</b> death <b>anxiety</b> would be more involved in their jobs, resulting in higher levels of organizational citizenship behavior and lower turnover intentions. In addition, I hypothesized that the relationship between <b>trait</b> death <b>anxiety</b> and job involvement will be moderated by need for achievement. This model was tested using a two time-point study, utilizing participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Results revealed a positive relationship between death anxiety and job involvement, and a negative relationship between death anxiety and turnover intentions mediated by job involvement. However, no significant relationships were found in regards to organizational citizenship behavior or need for achievement. Implications, limitations, and future directions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Mathematics is {{associated}} with anxiety for many students; an emotion linked to lower well-being and poorer learning outcomes. While findings typically show females to report higher <b>trait</b> math <b>anxiety</b> than males, no gender differences have to date been found in state (i. e., momentary) math anxiety. The present diary study aimed to replicate previous findings in investigating whether levels of academic self-concept was related to this discrepancy in <b>trait</b> versus state <b>anxiety</b> measures. Additionally, mathematics-related gender stereotype endorsement (mathematics is a male domain) was investigated as an additional predictor of the trait-state discrepancy. The sample included 755 German 9 th and 10 th graders who completed self-report measures of <b>trait</b> math <b>anxiety,</b> math self-concept, and gender stereotype endorsement, in addition to state measures of anxiety after math classes by use of a standardized diary for 2 - 3 weeks (Nwithin = 6207). As expected, females reported higher <b>trait</b> math <b>anxiety</b> but no gender differences were found for state math anxiety. Also in line with our assumptions, multilevel analyses showed the discrepancy between <b>trait</b> and state <b>anxiety</b> to be negatively related to students’ self-concept (i. e., a lower discrepancy for students with higher self-concepts). Furthermore, gender stereotype endorsement differentially predicted the trait-state discrepancy: When controlling for self-concept in mathematics, females who endorsed the gender stereotype of math being a male domain more strongly overestimated their <b>trait</b> math <b>anxiety</b> as compared to their state anxiety whereas this effect was not significant for males. The present findings suggest that gender stereotype endorsement {{plays an important role}} in explaining gender differences in math anxiety above and beyond academic self-concept.

The {{relationship}} between Personality <b>Traits,</b> <b>Anxiety</b> and Depression, in Life Quality of patients under treatment by Hemodialysis [HD]. Novel Biomed 2013; 1 : 1 - 7. Background: The {{purpose of this}} study is to examine personality traits in renal patients undergoing haemodialysis (HD) and its connection to depression, anxiety, and life quality. In this study we also aim to propose an intervention for treatment and prevention of these personality traits. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 70 patients affected by chronic renal failure undergoing haemodialysis treatment. Patients were selected based on an accessible sample. Required data were gathered through questioners: Hospital Anxiety and Depression, NEO-FFL, and SF- 36 Health Survey. Results: Based on the results obtained from this study 47. 1 % of patients undergoing HD treatment fall into the abnormal category according to the rate of depression. There is a positive meaningful correlation between conscientiousness and agreeableness and a negative correlation between extroversion, anxiety, and depression in life quality of renal patients. Conclusion: With respect to the correlation existing between the quality of life and the personality <b>traits,</b> <b>anxiety</b> and depression, in patients under HD treatment, life quality and treatment outcome can be improved if psychological problems are diagnosed early and psycho education and social interventions are presented. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the multidimensional interactionism model of anxiety, stress, and coping by investigating <b>trait</b> separation <b>anxiety,</b> controllability, and homesickness in 152 university students living away from home. Participants com-pleted measures of <b>trait</b> separation <b>anxiety,</b> state anxiety, perceived controllability of the situation, and homesickness. Correlational tests confirmed that <b>trait</b> separation <b>anxiety</b> and homesickness were associated. Also, low perceived controllability was associated with state anxiety and homesickness. Finally, tests of a mediational model confirmed that both perceived controllability {{of the situation and}} state anxiety are significant mediators of the association between <b>trait</b> separation <b>anxiety</b> and home-sickness. The findings provide support for models of homesickness that focus on diminished sense of personal control and proximity to attachment figures. Homesickness is a phenomenon that is experienced by many people. Although research has tended to focus on homesickness in university and college students (Fisher & Hood, 1987, 1988; Lu, 1990), homesickness has been studied in a variety of populations and contexts, including military recruits (Eurelings-Bontekoe, Vingerhoets, & Fontijn, 1994), foreign employ-ees of multinational corporations (Eurelings-Bontekoe, Brouwers, & Verschuur, 2000), prison inmates (Ireland & Archer, 2000), and children attending summer camp (Thurber, 1999).

40|$|The Author(s) 2013. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The present study examines a simple {{model for the}} relationship between temperament, anxiety and maladaptive metacognition. A clinical sample of patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders (n = 216) completed a set of self-reported questionnaires measuring temperament dimensions, state anx-iety and metacognitions. Three temperament traits were includ-ed in the hypothesized model: emotional reactivity, persevera-tion and briskness. A structural equation modeling analysis supported a model in which the relationship between the three temperament <b>traits</b> and <b>anxiety</b> were fully mediated by meta-cognition. Dissimilar models were identified for the male and female subgroups, and also with reference to individual cate-gories of maladaptive metacognition. The findings support the significance of metacognition as a factor influencing the temperament-anxiety relationship. Moreover, they confirm the roles both of emotional reactivity and of perseveration, being major <b>traits</b> related to <b>anxiety</b> which also turned out to be strongly associated with metacognition. In case of the models for the categories of metacognition, emotional reactivity was associated with negative beliefs, perseveration with negative and positive beliefs, while briskness predicted anxiety indepen-dently of metacognition. These results suggest the existence of more specific associations between temperament <b>traits,</b> <b>anxiety,</b> and various types of metacognition...|$|R

40|$|A growing {{theoretical}} and research {{literature suggests that}} trait and state social anxiety can predict attentional patterns {{in the presence of}} emotional stimuli. The current study addressed some inconsistencies and gaps in the literature using eye tracking methodology. Participants with high and low <b>trait</b> social <b>anxiety</b> were randomly assigned to either give a speech or to watch a video of another individual delivering a speech (state social anxiety manipulation). Next, participants were asked to engage in a free view task in which pairs of emotional facial stimuli (angry-happy, angry-neutral, or happy-neutral) were presented for 3 s. Eye movements were monitored continuously. Results revealed that individuals with high <b>trait</b> social <b>anxiety</b> are faster to make their first fixation on neutral and positive stimuli on trials that contain threatening stimuli, and that they are faster to disengage attention from threatening stimuli after their initial fixation on trials that contain neutral stimuli than low <b>trait</b> social <b>anxiety</b> participants. The <b>trait</b> social <b>anxiety</b> groups do not differ with regard to how often their attention returns to emotional stimuli or to how long they attend to emotional stimuli {{over the course of the}} trial. State social anxiety influences how often attention returns to each type of stimulus and the duration of the fixations on each type of stimulus. State social anxiety does not influence the timing or duration of the first fixation on emotional stimuli. Results are discussed in reference to the vigilance-avoidance hypothesis and basic attentional processes. Treatment implications, limitations of the study, and suggestions for future research are also discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{cognitive}} and attentional factors are hypothesised {{to be associated}} with post-event rumination, a key construct that has been proposed to contribute to the maintenance of social anxiety disorder (SAD). The present study aimed to explore factors contributing to post-event rumination following delivery of a speech in a clinical population. 121 participants with SAD completed measures of <b>trait</b> social <b>anxiety</b> a week before they undertook a speech task. After the speech, participants answered several questionnaires assessing their state anxiety, self-evaluation of performance, perceived focus of attention and probability and cost of expected negative evaluation. One-week later, participants completed measures of negative rumination experienced over the week. Results showed two pathways leading to post-event rumination: (1) a direct path from <b>trait</b> social <b>anxiety</b> to post-event rumination and (2) indirect paths from <b>trait</b> social <b>anxiety</b> to post-event rumination via its relationships with inappropriate attentional focus and self-evaluation of performance.
