One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until <b>the</b> <b>scream</b> from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise.

50|$|In Peru, {{the torture}} {{chambers}} of the Inquisition were specifically constructed with thick walls so that <b>the</b> <b>screams</b> of <b>the</b> victims could not penetrate them and no sound {{could be heard}} from the outside. Other more sophisticated designs used principles of acoustics to muffle <b>the</b> <b>screams</b> of <b>the</b> tortured and included walls which recessed and protruded in such a fashion as to reflect <b>the</b> <b>screams</b> of <b>the</b> victims so that the sounds would not be carried to the exterior.|$|R

5000|$|Vincent made a bold {{move and}} stacked <b>the</b> <b>Screaming</b> Eagles lineup with many NHL {{prospects}} for the 2003-04 season in hopes of bringing a League title to Cape Breton. Most of the players came from a notorious [...] "boomerang" [...] trade with the Halifax Mooseheads. After <b>the</b> <b>Screaming</b> Eagles won 49 games and captured a division title, Fleury returned from the Pittsburgh Penguins, leading many to think the team would be unstoppable in <b>the</b> playoffs. <b>The</b> <b>Screaming</b> Eagles, however, lost {{in the second round}} to the Chicoutimi Saguenéens.|$|R
50|$|The {{turn of the}} new {{millennium}} brought some hope to <b>the</b> <b>Screaming</b> Eagles franchise, as new Head Coach and General Manager Pascal Vincent was able to slowly turn things around. Some hardship continued when <b>the</b> <b>Screaming</b> Eagles attempted to strengthen the club by drafting future National Hockey League (NHL) star Ilya Kovalchuk tenth overall in the 2000 CHL Import Draft. Kovalchuk, however, declined to report to the team. Along with star players Marc-André Fleury, Dominic Noel, Stuart MacRae, and Stephen Dixon, <b>the</b> <b>Screaming</b> Eagles reached <b>the</b> QMJHL's conference final in 2002, only to lose in five games to Acadie-Bathurst Titan. Fleury's number 29 jersey went on to be retired by <b>the</b> <b>Screaming</b> Eagles in 2008. Kovalchuk's number 71 was retired in 2014, though it was soon revealed to be an April Fool's joke.|$|R
