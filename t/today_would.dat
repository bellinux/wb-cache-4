25|$|A {{computer}} simulation performed for the Lewis and Clark County office of Disaster and Emergency Services estimated that a 6.3 magnitude earthquake <b>today</b> <b>would</b> result in property damage over $500 million. Another concern for future earthquakes {{in the area}} is soil liquefaction, especially in the area {{north of the city}} where there are alluvial soils and a high water table.|$|E
25|$|On January 17, 2007, at its press tour sessions, NBC {{announced}} that <b>Today</b> <b>would</b> {{be expanded to}} four hours beginning that fall. In order {{to make room for}} the expansion, NBC – rather than take one hour of programming time allocated for syndicated or local programming away from its stations – made the decision to cancel the struggling daytime soap opera Passions.|$|E
25|$|In My Life and Work, Ford {{predicted}} that if greed, racism, and short-sightedness could be overcome, then economic and technological development {{throughout the world}} would progress {{to the point that}} international trade would no longer be based on (what <b>today</b> <b>would</b> be called) colonial or neocolonial models and would truly benefit all peoples. His ideas in this passage were vague, but they were idealistic.|$|E

25|$|The {{notion of}} how dances {{were to be}} {{executed}} changed dramatically over the years. For instance, doing an early-20th-century-style Sword Dance in a competition <b>today</b> <b>would</b> get a dancer disqualified nearly immediately. There used to be terrible confusion as to what would be allowed (or prescribed) where, until the SOBHD {{came up with a}} standard that has become acceptable to the majority of competitive dancers.|$|E
25|$|Although {{many members}} of the Church of England <b>today</b> <b>would</b> still be uncomfortable or sceptical about certain Catholic liturgical practices, they can be {{astonished}} to be told that, in the late 19th century, using incense, wearing vestments, putting candles on the altar and using unleavened (wafer) bread in the Eucharist could spark riots, put priests in prison and even led in 1888–90 to the prosecution of a bishop – Edward King, Bishop of Lincoln.|$|E
25|$|William Temple, {{after he}} retired from being what <b>today</b> <b>would</b> be called Secretary of State, wrote several bucolic prose works in praise of retirement, contemplation, and direct {{observation}} of nature. He also brought the Ancients and Moderns quarrel into English with his Reflections on Ancient and Modern Learning. The debates that followed {{in the wake of}} this quarrel would inspire many of the major authors {{of the first half of}} the 18th century (most notably Swift and Alexander Pope).|$|E

25|$|It was {{impossible}} to foresee, {{in the spring of}} 1944, the present cult of the English country house. It seemed then that the ancestral seats which were our chief national artistic achievement were doomed to decay and spoilation like the monasteries in the sixteenth century. So I piled it on rather, with passionate sincerity. Brideshead <b>today</b> <b>would</b> be open to trippers, its treasures rearranged by expert hands and the fabric better maintained than it was by Lord Marchmain.|$|E
25|$|Brian {{belonged to}} the Dál gCais (or Dalcassians), a newly styled kin group of {{ultimately}} Déisi origin who occupied a territory north of the Shannon Estuary, which <b>today</b> <b>would</b> incorporate {{a substantial part of}} County Clare and then formed the core of the new kingdom of Thomond. In earlier times their ancestors had controlled some lands in today's County Limerick as well, but these had been overrun by the Uí Fidgenti from the 9th century and the invading Norse in the 10th.|$|E
25|$|In 1914, Turner Valley {{became the}} first {{significant}} field found in Alberta. Eastern Canadian investors {{and the federal government}} showed little interest and the field was developed primarily by subsidiaries of U.S. companies. It was originally believed to be a gas field {{with a small amount of}} naptha condensed in the gas, but due to the lack of regulations, about 90% of the gas was flared off to extract the small amount of petroleum liquids, an amount of gas that <b>today</b> <b>would</b> be worth billions of dollars.|$|E

25|$|On June 1, 2006 (the {{day after}} Couric's departure), NBC News {{announced}} {{that for the}} summer of 2006, <b>Today</b> <b>would</b> move to a temporary outdoor studio as Studio 1A was going through renovations to prepare for its switch to high-definition. On that same day, NBC News launched a new advertisement promoting Vieira's arrival. That summer, Couric's anchor seat was filled by various hosts, consisting of Curry, Morales and Campbell Brown (all of whom were considered candidates to replace Couric), until Vieira took over that fall.|$|E
25|$|In January 2009, David Gyngell, chief {{executive}} of the Nine Network, and John Westacott, former head of news and current affairs, announced that <b>Today</b> <b>would</b> begin broadcasting on Sunday mornings. The program, entitled Today on Sunday, competes in the same timeslot as the Seven Network's Weekend Sunrise, which dominates Sunday morning television. The show launched on 1 February 2009 and the original team consisted of Cameron Williams and Leila McKinnon with the news presented by Amber Sherlock and the sport was presented by Tim Gilbert on Saturday and Michael Slater on Sunday.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{settlement of}} Belfast {{was little more}} than a village, based around the marshy ford where the River Lagan met the River Farset, which <b>today</b> <b>would</b> be where High Street meets Victoria Street. The Ford of Belfast existed as early as 665, when a battle was fought at the site. The current Church of Ireland church at this location (St. George's) is built on the site of an ancient chapel used by pilgrims crossing the water. The earliest mention of the Chapel of the Ford is in the papal taxation rolls of 1306.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a popular}} belief that these moves were {{originally}} taught to horses for military purposes, and indeed both the Spanish Riding School and the Cadre Noir are military foundations. However, while agility was necessary on the battlefield, most of the airs as performed <b>today</b> <b>would</b> have actually exposed horses' vulnerable underbellies to the weapons of foot soldiers. It is therefore {{more likely that the}} airs were exercises to develop the agility, responsiveness and physiology of the military horse and rider, rather than to be employed in combat.|$|E
25|$|This was a {{difficult}} situation for Carlos I who now relied on the riches of Jakob Fugger to sway the election in his favor. Fugger transferred the enormous sum of more than 850.000 guilders to the Prince-electors which ultimately resulted in the unanimous election of Carlos I as Holy Roman Emperor on 28 July 1519. Out of this 850.000 guilders Fugger himself funded around 550.000 while another merchant house of Augsburg, the Welser family, contributed about 150.000 and three Italian bankers providing the rest. What <b>today</b> <b>would</b> be seen as bribery was common practice in {{the election of the}} Emperor. Exceptional however was the immense sums involved, mainly due to the keen competition among the princely candidates.|$|E
25|$|While the Hudson Tunnel Project {{would double}} the number of tracks under the Hudson River, it would not result in an {{increase}} in rail capacity due to constraints at Penn Station. Penn Station operates at capacity during peak periods, and since {{it takes a long time}} for passengers to board and alight trains, trains cannot leave and enter the station as might otherwise be possible. Even with improvements in the station, there are inadequate train storage facilities at Penn, and there is no capacity in the East River Tunnels to allow for trains to be stored during middays at Sunnyside Yard. Without these additional improvements, it is assumed that the same number of trains going between New Jersey and New York <b>today</b> <b>would</b> be operating in 2030, albeit with the additional tunnel capacity.|$|E
5000|$|After a {{month or}} so, Rabindranath Tagore's death anniversary (Baishe Srabon) arrives. Prabir invites Pakrashi to meet a man named Rabindranath, and Pakrashi is {{surprised}} that [...] "Swapan" [...] is Prabir's servant Kaanai. Prabir admits {{that he was the}} mastermind behind the murders, with Kaanai (an ex-convict) carrying them out. He wanted to avenge the police force for his suspension, which he considered an insult to his hard work despite the loss of his family. After saying that <b>today's</b> <b>would</b> be the final killing, he shoots himself.|$|R
