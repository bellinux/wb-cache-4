5|$|Alpine {{symbolism}} {{has played}} {{an essential role}} in shaping {{the history of the country}} and the Swiss national identity. Nowadays some concentrated mountain areas have a strong highly energetic ski resort culture in winter, and a hiking (ger: das Wandern) or Mountain biking culture in summer. Other areas throughout the year have a recreational culture <b>that</b> <b>caters</b> <b>to</b> tourism, yet the quieter seasons are spring and autumn when there are fewer visitors. A traditional farmer and herder culture also predominates in many areas and small farms are omnipresent outside the cities. Folk art is kept alive in organisations all over the country. In Switzerland it is mostly expressed in music, dance, poetry, wood carving and embroidery. The alphorn, a trumpet-like musical instrument made of wood, has become alongside yodeling and the accordion an epitome of traditional Swiss music.|$|E

5000|$|Already {{categorized}} as gay or lesbian, many gay bars in larger cities/urban areas take this sub-categorization {{a step further}} by appealing to distinct subcultures within the gay community. Some of these sub-cultures are defined by costume and performance. These bars often forge a like-minded community in dozens of cities with leather gay bars, line-dancing gay bars, and drag revues. Other subcultures <b>cater</b> <b>to</b> men who fit a certain type, one that is often defined by age, body type, personality, and musical preference. There are some bars and clubs <b>that</b> <b>cater</b> more <b>to</b> a working class/blue collar crowd and some <b>that</b> <b>cater</b> <b>to</b> a more upscale clientele. There are gay bars <b>that</b> <b>cater</b> <b>to</b> [...] "twinks" [...] (young, smooth-bodied [...] ) and others <b>that</b> <b>cater</b> <b>to</b> bears (older, larger, hairier alternatives to the well-manicured and fey gay stereotype).

25|$|There {{are also}} industries, which {{transform}} raw materials into final goods. These industries include a vinegar factory and a wood, and bamboo furniture and hut processing plant in barangay Santos, {{as well as}} rattan shop in Barucboc. Another major observation that {{can be obtained from}} the distribution of business enterprises in the municipality is the presence of activities <b>that</b> <b>caters</b> <b>to</b> the needs of the agricultural sector or the personal needs and requirements of residents. For instance, there are four business activities concentrated in barangay Arellano, which supply agricultural equipment from nearby municipalities such as Mallig and Roxas. This condition is brought about by the fact that some farmers especially in barangays quite distant from the Poblacion such as Turod and Barucboc have accessibility problems. It was learned also that some business establishments in nearby municipalities provide financial assistance to these farmers, which make farmers gravitate toward these other centers. To cater to the personal needs of the local residents, {{there are a number of}} business activities, which provide such services as photo supplies, beauty parlors and video rentals.|$|E
25|$|The Italian {{community}} was composed {{almost entirely of}} Sicilians, mostly from the Palermo, Trapani, and Agrigento provinces in Sicily. In particular, the Sicilian townsfolk of Menfi, Santa Margherita di Belice, Trapani, Castelvetrano, and many other paesi had their own clubs (clubbu) in the area. Il Circolo di Santa Margherita di Belice, founded in Bushwick, remains the oldest operating Sicilian organization in the United States. These clubs often started as mutual benevolence associations or funeral societies but transformed along {{with the needs of}} their communities from the late 1800s until the 1960s, when many began to fade away. St. Joseph Patron of the Universal Church Roman Catholic Parish was the hub of the Sicilian community, and held five feasts during the year, complete with processions of saints or Our Lady of Trapani. St. Joseph opened in 1923 because the Italian community had been rapidly growing in Bushwick since 1900. This Sicilian community first was centered in Our Lady of Pompeii parish on Siegel Street in Williamsburgh. But as industry expanded along Flushing Avenue, the Sicilian population expanded with the growing need for labor by factory operators. St. Leonard's parish was the large German Catholic parish in the area, but the Italian {{community was}} not welcome there and was thus compelled to open its own parish. St. Leonard's closed in 1973. St. Joseph's is now a large and vibrant Latino parish run by the Scalabrini Order of priests, an Italian missionary order <b>that</b> <b>caters</b> <b>to</b> migrants.|$|E

500|$|As {{is true of}} {{many parts}} of Florida, the city's {{population}} has a strong seasonal variation, as snowbirds from the northern United States, Canada, and Europe spend the winter and early spring in Florida. The city is also {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Fort Liquordale" [...] because of its beaches, bars, nightclubs, and history as a spring break location, back in the 1960s and 1970s, {{for tens of thousands of}} college students. However, the city has actively discouraged college students from visiting the area since the mid-1980s, passing strict laws aimed at preventing the mayhem that regularly occurred each year in the 1970s and 1980s. The city had an estimated 350,000 college visitors for spring break 1985; by 2006, that number had declined to about 10,000. Since the 1990s, Fort Lauderdale has increasingly become a location <b>that</b> <b>caters</b> <b>to</b> those seeking the resort lifestyle seasonally or year-round and is often a host city to many professional venues, concerts, and art shows.|$|E
