25|$|In February 2016, in an {{interview}} with Ellen DeGeneres Rousey admitted that suicidal thoughts went <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> in the aftermath of her knockout loss to Holly Holm in November 2015.|$|E
500|$|During her Fame Ball Tour {{performance}} at Palm Springs, California, on April 11, 2009, Gaga {{explained to the}} crowd the true meaning behind the term [...] "Poker Face" [...] used in the song. She suggested that the song dealt with her personal experience with bisexuality. The idea behind the song was {{to be with a}} man but fantasizing about a woman, hence the man in the song needs to read her [...] "Poker Face" [...] to understand what is going <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
60|$|This {{argument}} ran hurriedly <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> as {{the girl}} stood calmly waiting.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's deceitful, Gabriel! No {{one knows}} what that poor critter goes <b>through.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>mind's</b> kinder onsettled o' late, and in that onsettled state, she breaks things. You see her break that plate just now? Well, perhaps I oughtn't to say it--but you being a friend and in confidence, for she'd kill me, being a proud kind o' nater, suthin' like my own, {{and it may not}} amount to nothin' arter all--but I kin always tell when you've been around by the breakages. You was here, let's see, the week afore last, and there wasn't cups enough left to go round that night for supper!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I have made {{anything}} of him," [...] answered Julia. [...] "I suppose he's much like other men when they're {{going to be}} married." [...] Julia quite understood the ideas that were passing <b>through</b> <b>her</b> sister's <b>mind,</b> and did not feel them to be unnatural.|$|R
6000|$|Next day, <b>through</b> <b>her</b> shopping, <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> {{sat back}} and observed. Dave Dyer and Sam Clark were as cordial {{as she had been}} fancying; but wasn't there an impersonal abruptness in the [...] "H' are yuh?" [...] of Chet Dashaway? Howland the grocer was curt. Was that merely his usual manner? ...|$|R
60|$|Pressing {{the baby}} to her breast, Gyp sat very still, and queer {{thoughts}} went <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
6000|$|In {{an instant}} these {{thoughts}} flashed <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> {{but all she}} did was to murmur something about the Heer van Goorl---- ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the idea}} passed <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> {{the sound of}} her daughter's voice startled her {{from the other side of}} the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh? What?" [...] gasped he, and his rubicund cheeks lost {{something}} {{of their high}} colour, for here was a possibility that had not entered into his calculations. But Mistress Quinn stayed not to answer him. Already she was making for the door, wiping the dough from her hands on to her apron as she went. A suspicion of <b>her</b> purpose flashed <b>through</b> <b>her</b> husband's <b>mind.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} give Bab a new idea, for in a minute all sorts of recollections, wishes, and plans rushed <b>through</b> <b>her</b> lively little <b>mind,</b> and she {{followed}} a sudden generous impulse as blindly as she often did a wilful one.|$|R
60|$|Those bitter {{words of}} Cleve's, {{as if he}} mocked himself, were the last Joan heard, and they rang in her ears and seemed to {{reverberate}} <b>through</b> <b>her</b> dazed <b>mind</b> like a knell of doom. She lay there, all blackness about her, weighed upon by an insupportable burden; and she prayed that day might never dawn for her; a nightmare of oblivion ended at last with her eyes opening to the morning light.|$|R
60|$|These things {{concerned}} Lucy, {{yet they}} only {{came and went}} swiftly <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> She was obsessed by things intimately concerning herself.|$|E
60|$|As this {{resolution}} darted <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> she repressed her disposition to scream, and, {{as far as}} she might, strove to conceal her fear.|$|E
6000|$|... "You think, then, June," [...] Mabel continued, as soon {{as these}} {{thoughts}} had passed <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> [...] "that I had better live in the blockhouse?" ...|$|E
60|$|Occasionally in <b>her</b> travels <b>through</b> <b>her</b> children's <b>minds</b> Mrs. Darling found {{things she}} could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was {{here and there in}} John and Michael's minds, while Wendy's began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters {{than any of the other}} words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.|$|R
5|$|When Simone {{was given}} the task {{to write a book}} about Madonna, she was {{enthusiastic}} about the opportunity, since she had admired the singer's musical output and her ambitious nature which has led to a successful career in show-business. Simone recalled how Madonna had struggled <b>through</b> <b>her</b> early days in New York city, and <b>through</b> <b>her</b> tough business <b>mind</b> and musical intuition had succeeded in crafting her own niche.|$|R
60|$|The {{simple and}} dispirited girl had thus far {{followed}} Mr. Sharpitlaw's lead, {{because he had}} artfully adjusted his observations to the thoughts he was pretty certain must be passing <b>through</b> <b>her</b> own <b>mind,</b> so that <b>her</b> answers {{became a kind of}} thinking aloud, a mood into which those who are either constitutionally absent in mind, or are rendered so by the temporary pressure of misfortune, may be easily led by a skilful train of suggestions. But the last observation of the procurator-fiscal was too much of the nature of a direct interrogatory, and it broke the charm accordingly.|$|R
6000|$|Was {{this the}} answer? Something darted <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> like a pang {{followed}} by a strange throbâ€”-"Give yourself up to Him. Seek the true good first. The other may lie on its way." ...|$|E
60|$|Eva quickly undressed {{and slipped}} into the pretty bed, where she lay looking at the red light till sleep kissed her eyelids, and a lovely dream floated <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> till morning came.|$|E
60|$|Mary's {{heart began}} to beat more quickly. Various ideas rushed <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> {{as to what the}} burning of a second will might imply. She had to make a {{difficult}} decision in a hurry.|$|E
60|$|The {{reader will}} readily enough comprehend, that the Molly Swash was not {{absolutely}} standing still while the dialogue related was going on, and the thoughts we have recorded were passing <b>through</b> <b>her</b> master's <b>mind.</b> On the contrary, {{she was not}} only in motion, but that motion was gradually increasing, {{and by the time}} all was said that has been related, it had become necessary for those who spoke to raise their voices to an inconvenient pitch in order to be heard. This circumstance alone would soon have {{put an end to the}} conversation, had not Spike's pausing to reflect brought about the same result, as mentioned.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only forty-five," [...] {{thought the}} girl. [...] "What strange ideas these older people have! And Ben was twenty-six." [...] Just {{what the doctor}} said {{afterwards}} she didn't hear, for {{she was thinking of}} the swift, wide arc of change <b>through</b> which <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> had swung from the time when Marshall Haney first came to Sibley--so grand of stride, so erect, so powerful. He, too, seemed young then; now he was old--old and feeble--a man to be advised, protected, humored. She dimly understood, too, that corresponding change had come to her; that she was far away from the girl who had stood behind the counter defending herself against the love-making of the bummers and drummers among her patrons--and yet she was the same, after all. [...] "I've not changed as much as he has," [...] was her conclusion. And she enjoyed the gayety and beauty of her companions, but she said little to express it.|$|R
60|$|Presently <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> {{cleared a}} little, and a keener pang of pain shot <b>through</b> <b>her</b> soul. She had been stunned at first, now she felt.|$|R
60|$|Ned {{watched her}} face, as these {{thoughts}} passed <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> He saw {{at once that}} {{she was willing to}} do all in her power, but saw also that there were difficulties in the way.|$|E
6000|$|He stood {{perfectly}} still, half a yard or more {{away from}} her; and it flashed <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> what {{a sort of}} lotus-eater's stupor had begun in him and was taking possession of her. Then he said-- ...|$|E
60|$|Sylvia looked disturbed; Bland {{could almost}} have fancied she was angry. As {{a matter of}} fact, troubled {{thoughts}} were flying <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> It was obvious that she would shortly {{be called upon to}} face a crisis.|$|E
60|$|Again the {{old woman}} looked at me intently <b>through</b> <b>her</b> spectacles; then, as if <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> was made up to confide in our honesty, she disburthened it of its secrets.|$|R
60|$|Who {{fired the}} place I never learnt. It {{may have been}} the Basutos, or Marnham's body-servant, or Footsack, or a spark from the kitchen fire. At any rate it blazed merrily enough {{notwithstanding}} the marble walls, as a wood-lined and thatched building of course would do. On the whole I suspected the boy, who may very well have feared lest he should be accused of having had a hand in his master's death. At least it was gone, and watching the distant flames I bethought me that with it went all Heda's past. Twenty-four hours before her father was alive, the bondservant of Rodd and a criminal. Now he was ashes and Rodd was dead, while she and the man she loved were free, with all the world before them. I wished that I could have added that they were safe. Afterwards she told me that much the same ideas passed <b>through</b> <b>her</b> own <b>mind.</b>|$|R
6000|$|This couplet sprang into <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> from nowhere, and {{immediately}} begot an endless series of similar couplets that {{she began to}} compose and address to Capes. They came teeming distressfully <b>through</b> <b>her</b> aching brain: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Celia," [...] said Dorothea, entreatingly, [...] "you {{distress}} me. Tell me at once {{what you}} mean." [...] It glanced <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> that Mr. Casaubon {{had left the}} property away from her--which {{would not be so}} very distressing.|$|E
60|$|Tuppence {{was quick}} in her mental processes. All these {{reflections}} passed <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> in a flash, {{and she saw}} where a chance, a very problematical chance, lay, and she determined to risk all in one supreme effort.|$|E
6000|$|Again {{the thought}} of who he really was flamed <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> [...] "What a life you lead! How {{do you happen to}} be here? I never {{expected}} to see you in a city--you don't fit into a city." ...|$|E
60|$|While {{this thought}} passed <b>through</b> Jeanie's <b>mind,</b> <b>her</b> guard, tired of silence, {{began to show}} some {{inclination}} to be communicative. He seemed a sensible, steady peasant, but not having more delicacy or prudence than is common to those in his situation, he, of course, chose the Willingham family as {{the subject of his}} conversation. From this man Jeanie learned some particulars of which she had hitherto been ignorant, and which we will briefly recapitulate for the information of the reader.|$|R
60|$|All the air round was {{so thick}} and dark, {{the people were}} so passionately revengeful and fitful, the {{innocent}} were so constantly put to death on vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her, every day shared the fate from {{which he had been}} clutched, that her heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be. The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now the dreadful carts were rolling <b>through</b> the streets. <b>Her</b> <b>mind</b> pursued them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more.|$|R
60|$|Gwendolen {{was glad}} that she had got <b>through</b> <b>her</b> {{interview}} with Klesmer before meeting her uncle and aunt. She had made up <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> now that there were only disagreeables before her, and she felt able to maintain a dogged calm {{in the face of}} any humiliation that might be proposed.|$|R
