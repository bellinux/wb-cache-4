5|$|The Cunard Building's {{architectural}} style can be generally {{described as a}} mix of Italian Renaissance and Greek Revival, {{with a degree of}} Beaux-Arts influence on the building's structural form. Willink and Caldwell's designs were heavily influenced by the work of Italian architect Baldassare Peruzzi and more broadly Italian Renaissance palace design in general, with the Farnese Palace in Rome believed to have been particularly influential. Despite the strong Italian influence, the architects chose to introduce Greek style for the details around <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> and, as <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> is larger than the Italian palaces that provided its inspiration, its structural form was prominently based upon American Beaux-Arts buildings such as those in New York.|$|E

5|$|The present {{church was}} {{believed}} to have been built upon the insistence of the Proctor-General, William de Guineville, under the ownership of Bec Abbey, to serve the growing population. He used the priory at Manor Farm as his main residence The first recorded vicar was William de Berminton in 1327. <b>The</b> <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> has been remodelled in parts over the centuries and was substantially restored by George Gilbert Scott in 1870.

5|$|After being decommissioned, Coalhouse Fort was leased {{and used}} as a storage {{facility}} by Bata Shoes, which operated the nearby Bata shoe factory in East Tilbury. It was also used for a while for emergency housing for demobilised servicemen and their families. In 1959, the parade ground {{was used as a}} coal store during a miners' strike. Thurrock Urban District Council (now Thurrock Council) purchased the fort in 1962 and still own it. The council turned the area around the fort into a riverside park but <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> decayed badly through neglect and vandalism.|$|E
5|$|In the African American {{section of}} the city, where most {{dwellings}} were built of discarded material, many homes were damaged. On one street, only two houses did not lose either their walls or roof. Walls and cars were cartwheeling down the streets. During the storm, about 100people ran to a trash incinerator, a concrete-reinforced building. A few of the local Black churches suffered significant damage. Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church lost many bricks on its front facade {{and much of the}} metal grillwork around the entrances, while <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> was deroofed. Payne Chapel AME Church, then located at Banyan Boulevard and Tamarind Avenue, was destroyed by the storm. St. Patrick's Catholic Church received about $40,000 in damage.|$|E

5|$|The Fakahani Mosque exemplifies this process. It {{was built}} in the Fatimid period, either as a {{suspended}} mosque (one with shops underneath it) or with a high basement. After the earthquake of 1302 it was rebuilt. In 1440 an ablution basin was added, and early in the Ottoman period a minaret was built. The amir Ahmad Katkhuda Mustahfazan al-Kharbutli in 1735 ordered a major reconstruction, almost all of the original building being replaced apart from two doors. These finely carved doors were registered as a historical monument in 1908 by the committee of conservation, and <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> was registered in 1937.|$|E
5|$|The incongruous make-up {{between the}} Western lower half and Thai roof has been {{compared}} with a Farang (Western) lady clothed in Victorian costume while wearing a Thai crown. The symbolism of this juxtaposition is the emphasis of the superiority of Thai architecture (as a crown upon the head) over those of the West (the {{lower half of the}} body). This stylistic innovation was more than an artistic coincidence, as it was supposed to convey a significant political message of Siamese resistance over Western imperialism, both of sovereignty and style. From another perspective, <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> epitomizes the internal political struggle between the ideas of Westernization and modernity (led by King Rama V) against those of the traditional ruling elites (as led by some of his early ministers).|$|E
5|$|The {{occupation}} of Group D dates {{as far back}} as the Middle Preclassic period. Group D was occupied as late as the Terminal Classic, when a termination ritual was apparently performed, after which the northern building of the group was abandoned. The ritual included scattering a large amount of rubbish in front of the south entrance to the building and then possibly burning <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>itself.</b> The rubbish is presumed to have come from the area of Group D itself and included some items associated with weaving and the manufacture of paper.|$|E

5|$|Moderate winds blew {{down about}} 1,600trees in the district, 23 of which fell onto houses. The United States National Arboretum lost many mature trees and azaleas {{on the bank}} of the Anacostia River. The winds also downed many power lines, leaving 129,000customers without power. Many streets were blocked by the fallen trees and power lines. At the White House, the winds downed one tree in the front garden, though there was no damage to <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>itself.</b> The storm surge {{resulted}} in flooding at the Washington Navy Yard. There, the marina was damaged, and some buildings and cars in low area garages were flooded. Five people were rescued from cars in flood waters during the storm, and several roads were closed due to the flooding. Throughout the district, the passage of Isabel created approximately 30,000pounds (13,600kg) of debris. Damage in Washington, D.C., totaled $125million (2003USD, ($ USD).|$|E
5|$|The Chrysler family {{inherited}} the property {{after the death}} of Walter Chrysler in 1940, with the property under the ownership of W.P. Chrysler Building Corporation. In 1944, the corporation filed plans to build a 38-story annex to the east of the building at 666 Third Avenue. In 1949, this was revised to a 32-story annex costing $9 million. The annex building, designed by Reinhard, Hofmeister & Walquist, had a similar facade design to the original Chrysler Building, but as the stone for the original building was no longer manufactured, the facade was instead replicated. Construction started on the annex in June 1950, and the first tenants started leasing in June 1951. <b>The</b> <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> was completed by 1952, and a sky bridge connecting the two buildings' seventh floors was built in 1959.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{contains}} {{a total of}} 58 Grade II listed buildings, including a Grade II* listed barn, and the Church of the Holy Cross, a Grade I listed building. The church dates from the late 12th century with early 13th and 15th century additions, {{as well as a}} substantial restoration in 1863. <b>The</b> <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> consists of stone walls, a tiled roof, and a stone slated porch. The oldest part is the chancel, which dates from the 12th century with 15th century extensions. The north chapel was altered in 1331, and in its churchyard is the grave of famed Second World War Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery (Viscount Montgomery of Alamein). Other listed buildings include Barnfield House – three houses which were once separated all dating from 1550 with 20th century restorations. The house itself has a timber frame with a tiled roof, including a late medieval hall. Mill Court, another Grade II listed building, is a large house dating from the early 19th century with a low pitched roof and yellow brickwork, and became a listed building on 15 August 1985.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{lighting}} in the top spires and decoration. The first are the V-shaped lighting inserts in the steel of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>itself.</b> Added later were groups of floodlights that are on mast arms directed back at the building. This allows {{the top of the}} building to be lit in many colors for special occasions. The tube lighting atop the building was added in 1981, although it {{had been part of the}} original design. Until 1998 the lights were turned off at 2a.m., but New York Observer columnist Ron Rosenbaum convinced Tishman Speyer to keep the lights on until 6a.m. Since 2015, the Chrysler Building and other city skyscrapers have been part of the Audubon Society's Lights Out program, wherein the building turns off its lights during bird migration seasons.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{conspiracy}} theories {{have been proposed}} about the events surrounding the bombing. Some theories allege that individuals in the government, including President Bill Clinton, knew of the impending bombing and intentionally failed to act on that knowledge. Other theories focus on initial reports by local news stations of multiple other unexploded bombs within <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> as evidence of remnants of a controlled demolition; following the attack, search and rescue operations at the site were delayed until the area had been declared safe by the Oklahoma City bomb squad and federal authorities. According to both a situation report compiled by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and a memo issued by the United States Atlantic Command the day following the attack, a second bomb located within the building was disarmed while a third was evacuated. Further theories focus on additional conspirators involved with the bombing. Additional theories claim the bombing {{was carried out by}} the government in order to frame the militia movement or to provide the impetus for new antiterrorism legislation while using McVeigh as a scapegoat. Other conspiracy theories suggest that foreign agents, particularly Islamic terrorists but also the Japanese government or German Neo-Nazis, were involved in the bombing. Experts have disputed the theories and government investigations have been opened at various times to look into the theories.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{contains}} {{a total of}} seven Grade II listed buildings and one Grade II* listed building—the Church of All Saints. Some of the oldest parts of the church date from the 13th century, although the structure was virtually rebuilt afresh in 1877. The church roof consists of red tiles with a small broach spire and a wooden turret. The walls are made of flint with stone dressed buttresses and the windows date from the Restoration period. Other listed buildings in the vicinity include Southwood Farmhouse, Manor Farmhouse and the Upper Farmhouse. Southwood Farmhouse is two storeys high and dates from the 18th century. Its walls are made of red brick with cambered floor openings and its roof is steeply tiled. Manor Farmhouse lies {{to the south of}} the village and consists of a near-identical design with Southwood Farmhouse, although it was probably constructed in the early 19th century. The Upper Farmhouse lies in the centre of the village and is a house of mixed periods. <b>The</b> <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> dates from the 17th century, though expansions were made in the 18th and 19th centuries. The house has interior framing and a Victorian lighting system. Its taller expansions were made in the 18th century, and in between the expansions lies a 19th century gable with a brick porch at its north side.|$|E
