5|$|The first udema {{was built}} in 1760 and had two masts (mainmast and foremast) that were {{originally}} rigged with lateen sails. It was later provided with a square sail rig {{similar to that of}} a polacca bark without <b>topgallant</b> sails. It had a low hull with a small quarterdeck structure and an arrangement of guns that was unique for its time. Its main armament consisted of a single line of eight 12-pound guns along the centerline of the ship and two 12-pounders in the bow facing forwards. The centerline guns used pivoting carriages that could be rotated 360 degrees and aimed to either side of the ship, similar to the main guns of the dreadnought battleships of the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|She {{had four}} masts and was rigged as a barque, with royal sails over double top and <b>topgallant</b> sails. Arrow was {{completed}} in April 1902. She was a sister ship to Eclipse, which was completed two months later.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} Sea Cloud featured royal-sails over single topgallant- and double top-sails on the fore and mizzen masts. The main mast {{was equipped with}} a royal-sail over double topgallant- and double top-sails. Today the first three masts are rigged with double top-sails, single <b>topgallants,</b> royals and a main skysail.|$|R
5000|$|Falls of Clyde {{was given}} to the Bishop Museum and opened to the public in 1968. In 1970 the {{grandson}} of original 19th century designer William Lithgow was engaged to assist in her restoration as a full-rigged ship. Support came from Sir William Lithgow, the shipbuilder and industrialist, whose Port Glasgow shipyard donated new steel masts, and <b>topgallants,</b> jib and spanker booms of Oregon pine.|$|R
25|$|She {{was smaller}} than Naseby (later renamed Royal Charles), but she was in regular service during the three Anglo-Dutch Wars, {{surviving}} the Raid on the Medway in 1667 by being at Portsmouth at the time. She underwent a second rebuild in 1685 at Chatham Dockyard, relaunching as a first rate of 100 guns, before {{taking part in the}} outset of the War of the Grand Alliance against Louis XIV of France. For the first time she ventured into the Irish Sea, and later participated in the Battle of Beachy Head (1690) and the Battle of La Hougue, when she was more than fifty years old. In that period she was the first ship in history that flew royals above her <b>topgallant</b> sails and a <b>topgallant</b> sail on the jigger-mast.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Luckner had {{the problem}} of feeding and keeping safe nearly 300 prisoners, in {{addition}} to his own crew. Consequently, when on 20 March, the French four-masted barque Cambronne was captured, Luckner arranged for the ship's <b>topgallant</b> mast and additional spars and sails to be removed, before putting his prisoners aboard Cambronne under the command of Captain Mullen of Pinmore. The much-reduced rigging on Cambronne ensured Seeadler would be able to escape before her location could be reported to the hunting ships.|$|E
25|$|Whereas 20th-Century square-rigged vessels were {{constructed}} of steel with steel standing rigging, prior vessels used wood masts with hemp-fiber standing rigging. As rigs became taller {{by the end}} of the 19th Century, masts relied more heavily on successive spars, stepped one atop the other to form the whole, from bottom to top: the lower mast, top mast, and <b>topgallant</b> mast. This construction relied heavily on support by a complex array of stays and shrouds. Each stay in either the fore-and-aft or athwartships direction had a corresponding one in the opposite direction providing counter-tension. Fore-and-aft the system of tensioning started with the stays that were anchored at in front each mast. Shrouds were tensioned by pairs deadeyes, circular blocks that had the large-diameter line run around them, whilst multiple holes allowed smaller line—lanyard—to pass multiple times between the two and thereby allow tensioning of the shroud.|$|E
25|$|Brig sails {{are named}} after the masts {{to which they are}} attached: the mainsail; above that the main topsail; above that the main <b>topgallant</b> sail; and {{occasionally}} a very small sail, called the royal, is above that. Behind the main sail there is a small fore-and-aft sail called the spanker or boom mainsail (it is somewhat similar to the main sail of a schooner). On the foremast is a similar sail, called the trysail. Attached to the respective yards of square-rigged ships are smaller spars, which can be extended, thus lengthening the yard, thus receiving an additional sailing wing on each side. These are called studding sails, and are used with fair and light wind only. The wings are {{named after the}} sails to which they are fastened, i.e. the main studding sails, main top studding sails, and the main top gallant studding sails, etc.|$|E
500|$|The {{ship was}} [...] long between perpendiculars, had {{a beam of}} [...] and a draft of [...] She {{displaced}} [...] and had a tonnage of 6,121bm. The hull was subdivided by watertight transverse bulkheads into 106 compartments and had a double bottom. Achilles was designed with a high centre of gravity and was very stiff. So {{much so that the}} ship only rolled 10 degrees during one storm that ripped the main and mizen <b>topgallant</b> masts off and split her topsails. Because of her great length she was not very manoeuvrable. Achilles had a crew of 709 officers and enlisted men.|$|E
500|$|The first turuma was {{completed}} in 1761. Along with the hemmema, it {{was the type of}} [...] "archipelago frigate" [...] that closest fit the description, showing considerable similarities with small ocean-going frigates. It had a low hull with no forecastle, only a low quarterdeck and no poop deck. It had three masts that were initially rigged with lateen sails, like a galley, which was later replaced with a conventional square frigate rig, but with combined top and <b>topgallant</b> masts. This improved its performance under sail and made it the best sailer in the archipelago fleet, though it was still slower than ordinary sailing vessels.|$|E
500|$|Minotaur finally {{commissioned}} in Portsmouth as {{the flagship}} of the Channel Squadron, a position which she retained until 1873. In 1868 the ship nearly rammed the ironclad [...] {{as they were}} leaving Belfast Lough. Minotaur lost her bowsprit and fore <b>topgallant</b> mast, but Bellerophon only suffered some minor flooding. She paid off for a long refit in 1873 and resumed her position in 1875 when she rejoined the Channel Squadron. Minotaur became the first ship in the Royal Navy to receive a permanent installation of an electric searchlight in 1876. The ship was the flagship of Vice Admiral Sir William Hewett, who had earned the Victoria Cross in the Siege of Sevastopol in 1854, during Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee Fleet Review on 23 July 1887. Minotaur was paid off {{at the end of}} 1887 in Portsmouth and assigned to the Reserve until 1893 when she became a training ship at Portland. She was renamed HMS Boscawen II in March 1904 and transferred in 1905 to Harwich as part of the HMS Ganges training school. The ship was renamed 11 June 1906 as HMS Ganges and then to Ganges II on 25 April 1908. She was sold on 30 January 1922 for scrap.|$|E
2500|$|She {{had four}} masts and was rigged as a barque, with royal sails over double top and <b>topgallant</b> sails. Regina Elena was {{launched}} in [...] July 1903, and completed that month.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to overlapping the mast below, the top mast and <b>topgallant</b> mast were supported laterally by shrouds that connected {{to either a}} platform, called a [...] "top", or cross-wise beams, called [...] "crosstrees", and anchored futtock shrouds from below {{that led to the}} lower mast.|$|E
2500|$|Sung {{with the}} job of hauling on halyards to hoist, over an {{extended}} period, topsail or <b>topgallant</b> yards. Usually there are two pulls per chorus as in [...] "Way, hey, Blow the man down!" [...] Examples: [...] "Hanging Johnny," [...] "Whiskey Johnny," [...] "A Long Time Ago," [...] and [...] "Blow the Man Down." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 19 September a {{lightning}} storm occurred at Gibraltar. Ships that sustained strikes, {{in some cases}} that caused damage or casualties, included Active, , , and [...] A strike destroyed several feet of the <b>topgallant</b> mast on Active and killed the ship's butcher, who had been standing near the main mast with a cleaver in his hand.|$|E

Her air draught was [...] Her sail area was [...] Pisagua was a sister ship to Placilla, which was {{launched}} seven months earlier than she was. Pisagua was assigned the Code Letters RJPT.|$|E
2500|$|Priwall was a four-masted steel-hulled barque with royal sails over {{double top}} and <b>topgallant</b> sails. The windjammer was {{ordered by the}} F. Laeisz {{shipping}} company of Hamburg and launched at the Blohm & Voss yard, Hamburg, on 23 June 1917. After delays arising from a shortage of materials during and after First World War, she was completed on 6 March 1920. [...] Priwall was used on the nitrate trade route {{to the west coast}} of South America; she also made several voyages from South Australia’s Spencer Gulf grain ports to Europe. Her code Letters were RWLN; in 1934 they were changed to DIRQ.|$|E
2500|$|Loch Vennachar {{was built}} in 1875 by Thomson's on the Clyde for the Glasgow Shipping Company. She {{was one of a}} fleet of iron wool {{clippers}} of the well-known Loch Line. Her registered tonnage and dimensions were: 1,552 tons gross, 1,485 tons net; length, 250 feet 1inch; breadth, 38 feet 3inches; depth of hold, 22 feet 4inches. [...] Her usual cargo was usually about 5,500 bales of wool. She was first rigged with fidded royal masts, but this proved to interfere with her stability as there was too much weight aloft. She was then given <b>topgallant</b> and royal masts in one with crossed royal yards over double-topgallants. Loch Vennachar was always in the wool trade to Adelaide and Melbourne, but when an out wool clipper, she also carried passengers and other cargo.|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "brig" [...] {{has been}} used in the past as an {{abbreviation}} of brigantine (which is the name for a two-masted vessel with foremast fully square rigged and her mainmast rigged with both a fore-and-aft mainsail, square topsails and possibly <b>topgallant</b> sails). The brig actually developed as a variant of the brigantine. Re-rigging a brigantine with two square-rigged masts instead of one gave it greater sailing power. The square-rigged brig's advantage over the fore-and-aft rigged brigantine was [...] "that the sails, being smaller and more numerous, are more easily managed, and require fewer men or 'hands' to work them." [...] The variant was so popular that the term [...] "brig" [...] came to exclusively signify a ship with this type of rigging. By the 17th century the British Royal Navy defined [...] "brig" [...] as having two square rigged masts.|$|E
60|$|Captain Sumner, {{aided by}} our hero and Jack, at length found the <b>topgallant</b> halyards, {{and lowered the}} sail in the peak.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, gentlemen, {{take the}} halyards, and rouse up the <b>topgallant</b> sails. I won't trust the crew on deck till the last minute." ...|$|E
60|$|With the {{assistance}} of the man Bob had relieved at the wheel, they soon had the <b>topgallant</b> sails, which had been furled, chock-a-block.|$|E
6000|$|... "They've got {{sight of}} us, sir," [...] shouted the lookout. [...] "They be firing guns to windward, an' letting fly their <b>topgallant</b> sheets." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind the}} shot, lads! Look alive! Now then, {{up with those}} <b>topgallant</b> sails! The quicker you get them up, the quicker we shall be out of range!" ...|$|E
60|$|Every rag of sail was now {{piled on}} to the ship, and {{as many of the}} others were showing nothing above their <b>topgallant</b> sails she rejoined the rest just as {{darkness}} fell.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's only a volcano," [...] said he. [...] "I {{knew there}} was one hereabouts, but thought it was extinct.--Up, there, and furl <b>topgallant</b> sails! We'll likely have a breeze, and it's well to be ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, sir, they're all {{the rest}} of the stars, and not planets at all. Then, sir, look around you, and you'll find {{everything}} going by threes. There are three topsails, three jibs, and three <b>topgallant</b> sails--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] replied Israel very humbly, [...] "I {{am going}} to my regular duty, if you will but let me. I belong to the maintop, {{and ought to be}} now engaged in {{preparing}} the <b>topgallant</b> stu'n'-sail for hoisting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir; {{about nine}} {{o'clock in the}} morning--the sea being smooth and the ship running, as I should think, about seven knots--you came up into the maintop, where I belong, and was pleased to ask my opinion about {{the best way to}} set a <b>topgallant</b> stu'n'-sail." ...|$|E
60|$|It was the Antelope. One of the Spanish shot {{had passed}} through the <b>topgallant</b> sail and--as {{that was the only}} injury that sail had received--the bit had been cut out, and a fresh one put in, before she sailed again from Gibraltar. She was flying Spanish colours.|$|E
6000|$|They lit {{the high}} sea-light, {{and the dark}} began to fall. [...] "All hands to loose <b>topgallant</b> sails," [...] I heard the captain call. [...] "By the Lord, she'll never stand it," [...] our first mate, Jackson, cried. [...] "It's the {{one way or the}} other, Mr. Jackson," [...] he replied.|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Stowel tells us, sir, {{that the}} yards {{ought not to}} be braced in exactly alike; but that we ought to check the weather-braces, a little, as we go aloft, so that the top-sail yard should point a little less forward than the lower yard, and the <b>topgallant</b> than the top-sail." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are sails. They are {{the upper}} sails of the Spanish fleet. I expect {{they are trying}} to work back into the bay again, but they won't do it, unless they get more wind. You see, I have taken the <b>topgallant</b> sails off the brig, {{so as not to be}} seen.|$|E
6000|$|... "And RODNEY, honoured sir, would grin To see you turning deadeyes in, Not UP, as in {{the ancient}} way, But downwards, like a cutter's stay-- You didn't oughter; Besides, in seizing shrouds on board, Breast backstays you have quite ignored; Great RODNEY kept unto the last Breast backstays on <b>topgallant</b> mast-- They make it tauter." ...|$|E
