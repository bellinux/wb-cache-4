5000|$|It {{has been}} found that several hot Jupiters have {{retrograde}} orbits and this calls into question the theories about the formation of planetary systems, although rather than a planet's orbit having been disturbed, {{it may be that the}} star itself flipped over early in their system's formation due to interactions between the star's magnetic field and the planet-forming disc. [...] By combining new observations with the old data it was found that more than half of all the hot Jupiters studied have orbits that are misaligned with the rotation axis of their parent stars, and six exoplanets in <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>have</b> retrograde motion.|$|E

[...] As noted before, given the potential unagressiveness of the male population in question, the differing aromatase levels may also have been evidence of aggression levels, not sexuality.

The study only compared Internet Explorer and Firefox, and left out among others Netcraft Toolbar and the Opera browser, both of which use data from PhishTank in their anti-phishing solutions.

5000|$|After {{completing}} his Ph.D. in Mathematics, Sankoff began his academic {{career at the}} University of Montreal in 1969. In 1971, Sankoff became interested in molecular sequence comparison and devised the first quadratic-time variant of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for pairwise sequence alignment. In 1973, Sankoff and Robert Cedergren developed a joint estimation method for phylogeny and multiple sequence alignment of 5S ribosomal RNA, laying the algorithmic foundations of comparative genomics. In 1975, Sankoff and Václav Chvátal studied {{the behavior of the}} longest common subsequence problem on random inputs; the constants of proportionality arising in <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>have</b> {{come to be known as}} the Chvátal-Sankoff constants.In 1980, Robert Cedergen and David Sankoff created the first research group in bioinformatics at the University of Montreal.

We also find that voter ID laws skew democracy toward those on the political right." [...] The results of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>have</b> been challenged in a paper by Stanford political scientist Justin Grimmer and four other political scientists. The paper says that the findings in the aforementioned study [...] "are a product of large data inaccuracies, that the evidence does not support the stated conclusion, and that model specifications produce highly variable results. When errors in the analysis are corrected, one can recover positive, negative, or null estimates of the effect of voter ID laws on turnout. Our findings underscore that no definitive relationship between strict voter ID laws and turnout can be established from the validated CCES data." ...|$|E

Advanced Cell Technology (ACT) located in Marlborough, Massachusetts, leads the trials aimed at improving the vision of patients with Stargardt's Macular Dystrophy and Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration. Originally, twelve patients were estimated to enroll at three hospitals in the U.S.; participating institutions included the Casey Eye Institute in Portland, Oregon, University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center in Worchester, Massachusetts, and the New Jersey Medical School in Newark, New Jersey. [...] Patients' eyes were injected with retinal pigmented epithelial cells derived from human embryonic stem cells.
