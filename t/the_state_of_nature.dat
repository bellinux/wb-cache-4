Early thinkers such as John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith saw {{humankind}} beginning in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> then finding meaning for existence through labor and property, and using social contracts to create an environment that supports those efforts.|$|E
25|$|James L. Richardson {{identified}} five central {{themes in}} Locke's writing: individualism, consent, {{the concepts of}} the rule of law and government as trustee, the significance of property and religious toleration. Although Locke did not develop a theory of natural rights, he envisioned individuals in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> as being free and equal. The individual, rather than the community or institutions, was the point of reference. Locke believed that individuals had given consent to government and therefore authority derived from the people rather than from above. This belief would influence later revolutionary movements.|$|E

25|$|The {{philosophy}} of Cumberland is expounded in De legibus naturae. Its main design is {{to combat the}} principles which Hobbes had promulgated as to the constitution of man, the nature of morality, and the origin of society, and to prove that self-advantage is not the chief end of man, that force is not the source of personal obligation to moral conduct nor the foundation of social rights, and that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> is not a state of war. The views of Hobbes seem to Cumberland utterly subversive of religion, morality and civil society. He endeavours, as a rule, to establish directly antagonistic propositions. He refrains, however, from denunciation, and is a fair opponent up to the measure of his insight.|$|E

German nationalism [...] was Romantic in nature that were based upon the principles of collective self-determination, territorial unification and cultural identity, and a political and cultural programme to achieve those ends.

Hale wrote a {{treatise}} on natural law that circulated among English lawyers in the eighteenth century and survives in three manuscript copies.

Hale's definition of the natural law reads: [...] "It is the Law of Almighty God given by him to Man with his Nature discovering the morall good and moral evill of Moral Actions, commanding the former, and forbidding the latter by the secret voice or dictate of his implanted nature, his reason, and his concience." [...] He viewed natural law as antecedent, preparatory, and subsequent to civil government, and stated that human law [...] "cannot forbid what the Law of Nature injoins, nor Command what the Law of Nature prohibits." [...] He cited as authorities Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Seneca, Epictetus, and the Apostle Paul. He was critical of Hobbes's reduction of natural law to self-preservation and Hobbes's account of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> but drew positively on [...] Hugo Grotius's De jure belli ac pacis, Francisco Suárez's Tractatus de legibus ac deo legislatore, and John Selden's John Selden's De jure naturali et gentium juxta disciplinam Ebraeorum.|$|E

2500|$|He {{published}} Main Currents in Nineteenth-Century Literature in 1906 (six volumes). This {{book was}} among the 100 best books for education selected in 2008 by Will Durant. Durant and Brandes were both contributors to the Mother Earth magazine. In Volume 2 Brandes says about Kierkegaard, [...] "It is not merely in name that this irony bears a fundamental resemblance to Kierkegaard's, which also aristocratically [...] "chooses to be misunderstood". The Ego of genius is the truth, if {{not in the sense}} in which Kierkegaard would have us understand his proposition, [...] "Subjectivity is the truth", still {{in the sense that the}} Ego has every externally valid commandment and prohibition in its power; and, to the astonishment and scandal of the world, invariably expresses itself in paradoxes. Irony is [...] "divine audacity". In audacity thus comprehended there are endless possibilities. It is freedom from prejudice, yet it suggests the possibility of the most audacious defense of all possible kinds of prejudices. It is more easily attainable, we are told, by woman than by man. “Like the feminine garb, the feminine intellect has this advantage over the masculine, that its possessor by a single daring movement can rise above all the prejudices of civilization and bourgeois conventionality, at once transporting herself into the state of innocence and the lap of Nature". The lap of Nature! There is an echo of Rousseau's voice even in this wanton tirade. We seem to hear the trumpet-call of revolution; what we really hear is only the proclamation of reaction. Rousseau desired to return to <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> when men roamed naked through the pathless forests and lived upon acorns.
