40|$|Abstract: The quality safety <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> {{food has}} played {{important}} role in governmental law, food industry management strategies, and consumers. Many institution and software companies have developed a lot of traceability system. There is a growing perception to implementation of reusability, multi resource data fusion and information sharing of the different system. The conceptual model is the key basic for the system reusability. The paper porposes an conceptual model of traceability system via integrating Petri nets, FMECA, with fuzzy probability, theory of evidence. The traceable resource unit(TRU) is classified and the infromation flow is optimized. The result shows that the model can improve the reusability and sharing of traceability system, conconquently improve the efficiency and decision-making quality for fast position and forward early warning in meat food quality safety traceability...|$|E

In order to obtain Pareto solutions from the developed model, a new solution approach was developed and its results were compared to two traditional solution approaches. A case study was applied conducive to an examination for the applicability of the developed model and the performance of the proposed solution approaches.

40|$|The {{traceability}} of {{food and}} food ingredients along the food chain is an essential element in ensuring food safety. It is a tool for tracing product and processing information of food from sea/farm to table, so that relevant information {{can be found at}} a later point. Traceability has been introduced in Croatia in 2007 for all food and feed as well as related business operators. The aim of this paper was to examine Croatian consumers’ awareness and their attitude towards <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> products, by means of a face-to-face survey on a sample of 120 respondents in Zagreb and surrounding. The research results show that the consumers’ awareness level with regard to food traceability was very low. Consumers familiar to any extent with traceability mostly do not know any product or company with implemented traceability system. Lack of knowledge about traceability concept resulted mainly in indifference regarding existence of this system; respondents do not consider it as an important cue of meat products. Only a few respondents consider it as necessary and are ready to pay higher price for traced meat products.

40|$|The Podolica {{cattle breed}} is {{autochthonous}} of Southern Italy and denoted by its particular rusticity. This study presents the preliminary results of genetic characterization of Podolica breed using DNA STR markers. A total of 20 microsatellite loci were analysed in 79 individuals reared in the Gargano area. Number of polymorphisms, allele frequencies, deviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportions, linkage disequilibrium between loci and genetic similarities between animals were calculated. The results showed a high deficiency of heterozygotes, the observed mean of heterozygosis being 0. 449, whereas the expected mean was 0. 766. Many markers showed also {{deviations from the}} Hardy-Weinberg proportions and significant linkage disequilibrium between loci. However, the genetic similarity within the population was low (0. 281) and {{the average number of}} alleles per locus was high (10), representing a high genetic variability. In order to explain these results, a stratification of the breed in sub-populations with a high interior genetic homogeneity, but a markedly differentiated one from each other could be hypothesized; this situation probably derived from non-random mating within each herd (consanguinity) and from the lack of exchange of genetic material between the herds. A further study is needed on a wider sample and extending the analysis to FAO-ISAG microsatellite panel in order to confirm this hypothesis. This could eventually provide the information necessary for the correct management of the reproductive schemes and for genomic <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> productio...|$|E
40|$|A risk ranking process {{identified}} Trichinella spp. as {{the most}} relevant biological hazard in the context <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> inspection <b>of</b> domestic solipeds. Without a full and reliable soliped traceability system, it is considered that either testing all slaughtered solipeds for Trichinella spp., or inactivation meat treatments (heat or irradiation) {{should be used to}} maintain the current level of safety. With regard to general aspects <b>of</b> current <b>meat</b> inspection practices, the use of manual techniques during current post-mortem soliped meat inspection may increase microbial cross-contamination, and is considered to have a detrimental effect on the microbiological status <b>of</b> soliped carcass <b>meat.</b> Therefore, the use of visual-only inspection is suggested for “non-suspect” solipeds. For chemical hazards, phenylbutazone and cadmium were ranked as being of high potential concern. Monitoring programmes for chemical hazards should be more flexible and based on the risk of occurrence, taking into account Food Chain Information (FCI), covering the specific on-farm environmental conditions and individual animal treatments, and the ranking of chemical substances, which should be regularly updated and include new hazards. Sampling, testing and intervention protocols for chemical hazards should be better integrated and should focus particularly on cadmium, phenylbutazone and priority “essential substances” approved for treatment of equine animals. Implementation and enforcement of a more robust and reliable identification system throughout the European Union is needed to improve <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> domestic solipeds. <b>Meat</b> inspection is recognised as a valuable tool for surveillance and monitoring of animal health and welfare conditions.

40|$|Purpose – In this paper, {{the authors}} {{investigated}} the economic feasibility of a three-echelon Halal Meat Supply Chains (HMSC) network that is monitored by a proposed RFID-based management system for enhancing the integrity <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> Halal <b>meat</b> products. The {{purpose of this}} study was aimed at maximizing the average integrity number <b>of</b> Halal <b>meat</b> products, maximizing the return of investment (ROI), maximizing the capacity utilization of facilities and minimizing the total investment cost of the proposed RFID-monitoring system. The location-allocation problem of facilities needs also to be resolved in conjunction with the quantity flow <b>of</b> Halal <b>meat</b> products from farms to abattoirs and from abattoirs to retailers. Design/methodology/approach – First, a deterministic multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model was developed and used for optimizing the proposed RFIDbased HMSC network towards a comprised solution based on four conflicting objectives as described above. Second, a stochastic programming model was developed and used for examining the impact on the number <b>of</b> Halal <b>meat</b> products by altering the value of integrity percentage. The ε-constraint approach and the modified weighted sum (MWS) approach were proposed for acquisition of non-inferior solutions obtained from the developed models. Furthermore, the Max-Min approach was used for selecting the best solution among them. Findings – The research outcome shows the applicability of the developed models using a real case study. Based on the computational results, a reasonable ROI can be achievable by implementing RFID into the HMSC network. Research implications – This work addresses interesting avenues for further research on exploring the HMSC network design under different types of uncertainties and transportation means. Also, environmentalism has been becoming increasingly a significant global problem in the present century. Thus, the presented model could be extended to include the environmental aspects as an objective function. Practical implications – The model can be utilized for food supply chain designers. Also, it could be applied to realistic problems in the field of supply chain management. Originality/value – Although there were a few studies focusing on the configuration of a number of HMSC networks, this area is overlooked by researchers. The study shows the developed methodology can be a useful tool for designers to determine a cost-effective design of food supply chain networks...|$|R
40|$|Nero Siciliano is an {{autochthonous}} Sicilian pig breed. The {{animals are}} usually completely black {{but a few}} show white portions mainly in the face or in the fore legs. Here we analysed two coat colour affecting genes, KIT and melanocortin 1 receptor (MC 1 R), with the aim to i) characterize the Nero Siciliano breed at these two loci, ii) identify mutations associated {{with the presence of}} white coat colour patterns and iii) identify DNA markers useful for breed <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> obtained from Nero Siciliano pigs. Two samples were considered in this study: i) 104 pigs collected from 13 different farms, without recorded information on coat colour; ii) 72 pigs sampled from 4 farms with recorded coat colour data. The intronless porcine MC 1 R gene was analysed amplifying three PCR fragments containing the polymorphic sites that make it possible to distinguish the E+, ED 1, ED 2, EP and e alleles. Five alleles (ED 2, EP, ED, e and E+) have been identified at the MC 1 R locus, thus markers at this gene cannot be used for Nero Siciliano product traceability. We genotyped 97 Nero Siciliano pigs (25 with white portions) for the splice site mutation of the intron 17 of the KIT gene that is associated with the Dominant White I allele. These animals were also analysed for the presence of the duplication of the same gene. None of the pigs carried the splice site mutation while 7 out of 25 animals with white portions were positive for the duplication test. Then, 20 of the 21 exons of the KIT gene (including intronic regions) were sequenced in eight Nero Siciliano pigs with different colour patterns and in one Large White animal. The results suggest that the presence of white portions in Nero Siciliano pigs might be only in part due to mutations in the KIT gene...|$|E

The breed is well adapted to marginal conditions and is appreciated for its reproductive performance, disease resistance and production <b>of</b> tasty <b>meat.</b> For a genetic characterization of this breed we analyzed the allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight major or candidate genes (ryanodine receptor 1, RYR 1; Na+, K+ ATPase subunit α 2, ATP 1 A 2; myosin heavy chain 2 B, MYH 4; sarcolipin, SLN; cathepsin B, CTSB; cystatin B, CSTB; estrogen receptor, ESR; melanocortin receptor 1, MC 1 R) for performance and phenotypic traits. The animals that were sampled and analyzed represent about 6 - 8 % of the total NS pig population. PCR-RFLP or PCR-SSCP techniques were used to type the DNA markers in the selected loci. Exact test of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was computed for each locus, Fis statistics and heterozygosity were calculated for each locus and over all loci. Allele frequencies obtained in NS breed were compared to the frequencies already available in literature for the Large White, Landrace, Duroc, Belgian Landrace, Piétrain, Hampshire and Meishan breeds. For the ESR locus, as no information on the distribution of the two alleles were available, we typed a sample of unrelated pigs from the considered breeds. Even if only eight loci were studied in NS breed, important elements were obtained from the data. The 1843 T (n) allele at the RYR 1 locus is present in NS breed, thus the molecular test to identify the carriers of this allele should be adopted to avoid its spreading in the population. Moreover, other studies are needed to clarify the allelic structure of the MC 1 R gene, which affects coat color, in order to evaluate if this gene could be used in genetic tests for the <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>meat</b> products <b>of</b> this breed.
