25|$|Topic marking 2 (tm2) and topic marking 3 (tm3) {{are both}} used with base-generated topics. Tm2 is {{characterized}} by raised eyebrows, widened eyes, and the head tilted backwards and to the side. Toward {{the end of the}} sign the head moves forward and to the opposite side, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> and often an eye blink before continuing. For tm3 the eyebrows are raised and the eyes are opened wide, the head starts tilted down and jerks up and down, the lips are opened and raised, and the head is nodded rapidly a few times before pausing and continuing the sentence. Although both tm2 and tm3 accompany base-generated topics, they are used in different contexts. Tm2 is used to introduce new information and change the topic of a conversation to something that the signer is going to subsequently characterize, while tm3 is used to introduce new information that the signer believes is already known by his/her interlocutor. Tm2 may be used with any base-generated topic, whereas only topics that are co-referential with an argument in the sentence may be marked with tm3.|$|E
2500|$|The first type of non-manual marking, topic marking 1 (tm1), is {{only used}} with a moved topic. Tm1 is {{characterized}} by raised eyebrows, widened eyes, and head tilted backwards. At {{the end of the}} sign the head moves down and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause,</b> often with an eye blink, before the sentence is continued. The following {{is an example of a}} context in which the tm1 marking is used: ...|$|E
2500|$|Tina Fey {{has said}} that Liz' {{relationship}} with Jack is [...] "somewhere between Mary Tyler Moore and Lou Grant, and Han Solo and Princess Leia." [...] Fey previously stated that {{there would not be}} a romantic relationship between the two, as it would be [...] "too icky." [...] More recently, however, she admitted there is sexual tension between Jack and Liz. Jack passes Liz off as his girlfriend to make ex-wife Bianca jealous and Bianca tells Liz in one scene that [...] "I can tell from the way he [...] looks at you that he's serious". Colleen Donaghy, Jack's mother, thinks that Liz is a perfect match for Jack. In [...] "Do-Over", Jack and Liz attempt to win over temporary head of GE, Kathy Geiss by pretending to have a soap opera-style real life relationship, escalating to the point where Geiss wants the two to kiss each other (her shouting [...] "KISS!" [...] marks the only time Kathy Geiss has spoken in the entire series); <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause,</b> but Jack and Liz refuse.|$|E

2500|$|Recitative. At the {{conclusion}} of the duet Hamlet enters, and the orchestra plays Hamlet's Theme. When the 8-bar theme has concluded, the King calls to Hamlet (The King: Cher Hamlet [...] "Dear Hamlet"), and Hamlet responds [...] "Sire!". Claudius asks Hamlet to refer to him as Father, but Hamlet responds that his father is dead. Claudius offers his hand, in Hamlet's father's name. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> as the orchestra begins again to play Hamlet's Theme, and Hamlet responds: [...] "His is cold and lifeless." [...] When the theme has finished, Claudius calls Hamlet [...] "My son...", but Hamlet angrily responds: [...] "My name is Hamlet!", and starts to walk away. The orchestra begins Hamlet's Theme again, and Gertrude asks whether Hamlet seeks the young and beautiful Oph√©lie, but Hamlet responds that youth and beauty will vanish in a single day. When the orchestra has finished playing Hamlet's Theme, Claudius suggests that Hamlet may wish to travel abroad, to France and Italy, but Hamlet responds he'd rather travel, like the clouds, among the stars, amid bolts of lightning.|$|E
