5000|$|<b>Toripristone</b> (INN) (developmental {{code name}} RU-40555) is a synthetic, steroidal antiglucocorticoid {{as well as}} antiprogestogen which was never marketed. It is {{reported}} as a potent and highly selective antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (Ki = 2.4 nM), though it also acts as an antagonist of the progesterone receptor (PR). [...] The pharmacological profile of <b>toripristone</b> {{is said to be}} very similar to that of mifepristone, except that <b>toripristone</b> does not bind to orosomucoid (Î±1-acid glycoprotein). The drug has been used to study the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and {{has been used as a}} radiotracer for the GR. Its INN was given in 1990.|$|E
