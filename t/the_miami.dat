5|$|The {{geologic}} formations {{that have}} the most influence on the Everglades are <b>the</b> <b>Miami</b> Limestone and the Fort Thompson Formation. <b>The</b> <b>Miami</b> Limestone forms {{the floor of the}} lower Everglades. <b>The</b> <b>Miami</b> Limestone is made up of ooids: tiny formations of egg-shaped concentric shells and calcium carbonate, formed around a single grain of sand. <b>The</b> <b>Miami</b> Limestone was formerly named <b>the</b> <b>Miami</b> Oolite, which comprises facies of ooids and fossilized bryozoan organisms. The unique structure was some of the first material used in housing in early 20th-century South Florida. The composition of this sedimentary formation affects the hydrology, plant life, and wildlife above it: the rock is especially porous and stores water during the dry season in the Everglades, and its chemical composition determines the vegetation prevalent in the region. <b>The</b> <b>Miami</b> Limestone also acts as a dam between Fort Lauderdale and Coot Bay.|$|E
