5|$|A Baptist {{church was}} built, {{also on the}} main road, and opened in 1923. It was a timber-framed {{weatherboard}} building, built on land donated by the first Baptist minister's son, the local butcher. The last service at the church was held 28 April 1985. Prior to <b>this,</b> <b>as</b> attendance declined, the congregations of the Baptist and Uniting Churches had often combined, and roles such as the organist were shared.|$|E
5|$|A {{particularly}} damning {{piece of}} evidence came from a bonnetmaker named Maria Durden who told the court that Webster had visited her {{a week before the}} murder and had said {{that she was going to}} Birmingham to sell some property, jewellery and a house that her aunt had left her. The jury interpreted <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a sign that Webster had premeditated the murder and convicted her after deliberating for about an hour and a quarter.|$|E

5|$|According to Maple's account, in {{the last}} few weeks of Pickingill's life, when he had become very ill, the local people moved him to the {{infirmary}} against his will, where he declared that at his funeral there would be one more demonstration of his magical powers. Many locals interpreted <b>this</b> <b>as</b> coming true when as the hearse carrying his coffin drew up to the churchyard, the horses stepped out of their harness shafts. His body was subsequently buried in the church's graveyard, whilst his abandoned house gradually became dilapidated before falling down.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the film}} {{historian}} Denis Meikle, Robertson, Mamoulian, and Fleming's films followed a pattern set by Sullivan's play: making Hyde's evil sexual and the Jekyll-Hyde transformation central to the performance. Meikle viewed <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a deterioration of Stevenson's original narrative initiated by Sullivan. Later adaptations diverged from the model established by Sullivan and the early films; some returned to Stevenson's novella, and others spun new variations from aspects of earlier versions.|$|E

5|$|Additional minor classifications {{included}} the combativity classification, {{which was a}} compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Alessandro Petacchi was the original winner, but with all his 2007 Giro results forfeited, it appears there is no official winner of this award. The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage. Petacchi originally won <b>this</b> <b>as</b> well.|$|E
5|$|After {{settling}} at Glen Noe, {{the chiefs}} {{are said to}} have held the land for centuries. While presumably owning the property outright originally, it is generally agreed that at some, uncertain date, they acquired a feudal obligation to the Campbells of Breadalbane. Initially, this entailed only a symbolic payment. Tradition identifies <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a snowball supplied at midsummer and a white calf surrendered but then killed and shared by landlord and tenant as a token of mutual esteem.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten weeks}} being {{constantly}} watched to prevent suicide attempts in police custody, he {{was transferred to}} Akershus Fortress and awaited trial {{as part of the}} legal purge. Despite initially losing weight and suffering from polyneuritis, his strong constitution meant that he soon started working hard on his case with Henrik Bergh, a lawyer with a good track record but largely unsympathetic, at least initially, to Quisling's plight. Bergh did, however, believe Quisling's testimony that he tried to act {{in the best interests of}} Norway and decided to use <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a starting point for the defence.|$|E

5|$|After the Simpsons {{arrive at}} home, the camera cuts {{to a shot}} of them on the couch, then zooms out to show <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a picture hanging on the wall of a fictional {{overseas}} Asian animation and merchandise sweatshop. The animation color quickly becomes drab and gray, and the music turns dramatic à la Schindler's List. A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and toxic waste, and a female artist hands a barefoot child employee an animation cel, which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid.|$|E
5|$|After {{the judges}} {{returned}} home, Lawrence {{was made a}} Baron for his work at Nuremberg, but Birkett received nothing. The lack of reward for his work pushed him into depression, which he took many months to recover from.

At Augustus’ request in 11 BC, Tiberius divorced Vipsania and married Julia the Elder, Augustus' daughter and Agrippa's widow. Tiberius was very reluctant to do <b>this,</b> <b>as</b> Julia had made advances to him when she was married and Tiberius was happily married. His new marriage with Julia was happy at first, but turned sour.|$|E

5|$|Ali Bhai visits Hyderabad and assassinates Narayana. He meets Pandu {{to discuss}} {{the murder of a}} {{minister}} by blowing up a balloon. Pandu rejects <b>this</b> <b>as</b> it would involve killing innocents. At the same time as they are arguing, Qadri arrests Ali Bhai and tortures him. Ali Bhai's henchmen retaliate by filming Qadri's daughter as she is enticed into sexual activity by the minister's son, and release it to the media. They also kidnap her, forcing the police to release Ali Bhai. At the same time, Pandu manages to catch the gangsters who pretended to rape Shruti and she reconciles with him.|$|E
5|$|All {{specimens}} discovered until 1967 were in coarse-grained sandstone {{that prevented}} preservation of fine details, making interpretation difficult. S.B.

5|$|Amid the enquiry, Thompson and Maguire {{received}} {{a number of}} threats and had to tolerate other more minor vexations. Maguire, unaccustomed to the African bush as he was, brought a number of accusations on himself through his personal habits. One day he happened to clean his false teeth in what the Matabele considered a sacred spring and accidentally dropped some eau de Cologne into it; the angry locals interpreted <b>this</b> <b>as</b> him deliberately poisoning the spring. They also alleged that Maguire partook of witchcraft and spent his nights riding around the bush on a hyena.|$|E

Lalich sees <b>this</b> <b>as</b> {{a way that they}} increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw. Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.|$|E
