5|$|Geastrum triplex may be {{confused}} with G.saccatum or G.fimbriatum, as <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> do not always crack around the perimeter to form a bowl under the spore case. However, it is larger than either of these species. The combination of characteristics which distinguish G.triplex from other earthstars include the lack of debris adhering to the outer surfaces, the saucer-like base in which the spore case is seated, the relatively large size, the fibrillose peristome and the paler area surrounding the peristome separating it {{from the rest of}} the endoperidium. Unlike some other Geastrum species, <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> of G.triplex are not hygroscopic: they do not open and close in response to changes in humidity.|$|E

5|$|The German-born British {{physicist}} Arthur Schuster expanded upon Crookes' experiments {{by placing}} metal plates {{parallel to the}} cathode rays and applying an electric potential between the plates. The field deflected <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> toward the positively charged plate, providing further evidence that <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> carried negative charge. By measuring the amount of deflection for a given level of current, in 1890 Schuster was able to estimate the charge-to-mass ratio of the ray components. However, this produced a value {{that was more than}} a thousand times greater than what was expected, so little credence was given to his calculations at the time.|$|E
50|$|Most {{implementations}} of <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> casting algorithm consecutively check intersections of a ray {{with all}} sides of the polygon in turn. In this case the following problem must be addressed. If <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> passes exactly through a vertex of a polygon, then it will intersect 2 segments at their endpoints. While it is OK for the case of the topmost vertex in the example or the vertex between crossing 4 and 5, the case of the rightmost vertex (in the example) requires that we count one intersection for the algorithm to work correctly. A similar problem arises with horizontal segments that happen to fall on <b>the</b> <b>ray.</b> <b>The</b> issue is solved as follows: If the intersection point is a vertex of a tested polygon side, then the intersection counts only if the second vertex of the side lies below <b>the</b> <b>ray.</b> This is effectively equivalent to considering vertices on <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> as lying slightly above <b>the</b> <b>ray.</b>|$|R

50|$|Ray tracing {{works by}} {{assuming}} that the particle or wave can be modeled as {{a large number of}} very narrow beams (rays), and that there exists some distance, possibly very small, over which such a ray is locally straight. <b>The</b> <b>ray</b> tracer will advance <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> over his distance, and then use a local derivative of the medium to calculate <b>the</b> <b>ray's</b> new direction. From this location, a new ray is sent out and the process is repeated until a complete path is generated. If the simulation includes solid objects, <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> may be tested for intersection with them at each step, making adjustments to <b>the</b> <b>ray's</b> direction if a collision is found. Other properties of <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> may be altered as the simulation advances as well, such as intensity, wavelength, or polarization. The process is repeated with as many rays as are necessary to understand the behavior of the system.|$|R
5|$|The Tampa Bay Rays, {{originally}} {{named the}} Devil Rays, joined Major League Baseball at its last expansion in 1998. The team's inaugural manager was Larry Rothschild, {{who spent his}} entire managerial career with <b>the</b> <b>Rays.</b> He managed the team for parts of four seasons and accrued a 205–294 record. Rothschild was replaced during the 2001 season by Hal McRae. Before the 2003 season, McRae was replaced by Lou Piniella, who led the team for three seasons. After 2005, Piniella departed {{and was replaced by}} Joe Maddon, who has statistically been the most successful manager in franchise history. Maddon is the only manager to lead <b>the</b> <b>Rays</b> to the postseason, accumulating an 8–8 record and leading his team to the 2008 World Series. He leads all Rays managers in games managed (648), regular season wins (308) and losses (340), and winning percentage (.475). Maddon also won the 2008 and 2011 American League Manager of the Year Award. Maddon opted out of his contract in late October 2014. On December 5, 2014, <b>the</b> <b>Rays</b> hired former Cleveland Indians bullpen coach Kevin Cash to replace Maddon.|$|E
5|$|After a 91-minute rain delay, the offenses {{fought back}} and forth, scoring run after run in an up-and-down affair in Philadelphia. Ryan Howard ended his home run drought, hitting his first round-tripper {{since the end}} of September. Chase Utley and Carlos Ruiz also hit home runs for the Phillies, while Carl Crawford and Dioner Navarro contributed a double each for <b>the</b> <b>Rays.</b> Philadelphia starter Jamie Moyer turned in his first strong {{performance}} of the post-season, allowing three runs over 6⅓ innings. His counterpart Matt Garza allowed four runs over six innings, but neither would factor in the decision. After <b>the</b> <b>Rays</b> tied the game {{in the top of the}} eighth, the Phillies loaded the bases on two intentional walks with Eric Bruntlett on third base. Even with a five-man infield, Ruiz was still able to engineer some late-game heroics, sneaking a dribbling ground ball down the third base line to score Bruntlett. Philadelphia took a 21 series lead.|$|E
5|$|Although {{other teams}} {{including}} the Kansas City Royals, Baltimore Orioles, and New York Yankees had vied for a Wild Card spot, the Indians, Rangers, and Rays all remained in contention {{until the end}} of the season. Entering the final day of the scheduled regular season, on which all three teams played, the Indians had a 91–70 record while both the Rangers and Rays had 90–71 records. These were the best non-division-leading records in the American League. Thus, the possibility existed (had the Indians lost and <b>the</b> <b>Rays</b> and Rangers won) for a three-way tie for the two Wild Card spots, which would have required several tie-breaker games to settle. However, all three teams won, leaving the Indians definitively in the Wild Card Game at 92–70 and <b>the</b> <b>Rays</b> and Rangers tied at 91–71 for the second spot.|$|E
40|$|Both {{paraxial}} ray tracing and two-point ray tracing are powerful tools for solving wave propagation problems. When a slowness model is mildly perturbed from a reference model, {{one can use}} perturbation theory for the determination of <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> positions and <b>the</b> traveltimes. An extension of Fermat’s theorem is presented, which states that the traveltime is stationary {{with respect to the}} perturbations in <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> position provided that the endpoints of <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> are perturbed along the wavefront of <b>the</b> unperturbed <b>ray.</b> It is shown that when <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> perturbation satisfies this condition the second-order traveltime perturbation can be computed from <b>the</b> first-order <b>ray</b> perturbation.

He went 3-for-4 with a double, a home run, and two RBI in the game overall. This left him 11-for-19 with seven home runs and ten RBIs in season finales from 2009–2013.
