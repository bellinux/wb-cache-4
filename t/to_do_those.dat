"Wrecking Ball" [...] is a pop ballad; [...] According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing America, {{it is set}} in common time with a tempo of 60 beats per minute. The track is written in the key of D minor and follows the chord progression Dm–F–C–Gm. Miriam Coleman of Rolling Stone noted that {{it begins with a}} minimalist keyboard instrumentation, which puts emphasis on Cyrus [...] "anguished vocals", and also described it as a [...] "heartbroken counterpoint" [...] to [...] "We Can't Stop". Cyrus said that [...] "Wrecking Ball" [...] was inspired by [...] "OneRepublic, and the way Timbaland used <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>those</b> big ballads." ...|$|E
500|$|Smith {{played on}} the Stafford Indians {{football}} team as a quarterback, running back, wide receiver, cornerback, kickoff returner, and punt returner. In Stafford's 2004 game against King George, Smith opened with a 54-yard kickoff return, played quarterback, and scored on a 63-yard punt return. His coach, Roger Pierce, said, [...] "Torrey can do those type of things for us. We expect him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>those</b> things." [...] During his senior year in 2006, Smith had 155carries for 815yards and 12touchdowns, completed nine of 25passes for 230yards and twotouchdowns, and made three receptions for 81yards. Over {{the course of his}} interscholastic career, Smith returned six kickoffs for touchdowns. He earned all-state kick returner honors as a sophomore, all-district honors as a junior, and honorable mention All-Northwest Region quarterback honors, all-district, and all-area honors as a senior.|$|E
500|$|Douglas filmed {{the opening}} scene, which is Gekko being {{released}} from Sing Sing maximum-security prison, in Ossining, Westchester County, on September 18. Stone felt that the prison scene was a [...] "key plot element" [...] {{because there is no}} one there to meet Gekko, who returns to society as an outsider. Regarding there being no scenes that show Gekko adjusting to the modern world, the director clarified that there is [...] "very little space <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>those</b> kind of tricks in this movie" [...] because of how modern the world is becoming on a monthly basis. Filming took place in Fordham University for the classroom scenes on October 10 and 11. In order to shoot a dining scene between LaBeouf and Douglas, Shun Lee West closed for 24 hours so the two could film scenes at the restaurant for the entire day of November 10. Brolin and Stone found extras simply by asking workers, at places like RdV, if they would like {{to be a part of}} the sequel.|$|E

And then, so, for this, uh, this contract with Island Def Jam, in the beginning I separated it to this English language album, and I don't do Japanese translations. I just, my integrity as an artist just would not take that, could not take that." ...|$|E
500|$|Paid to Love {{is notable}} in Hawks's filmography {{as being the}} only time that he made a highly stylized, {{experimental}} film. He attempted to imitate the style of German film director F. W. Murnau, who had recently made The Last Laugh and Sunrise and was the most critically acclaimed director in Hollywood. Hawks's film includes atypical tracking shots, expressionistic lighting and stylistic film editing that was inspired by German Expressionist cinema. In a later interview, Hawks commented [...] "It isn't my type of stuff, at least I got it over in a hurry. You know the idea of wanting the camera <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>those</b> things: Now the camera's somebody's eyes." [...] Hawks worked on the script with Seton I. Miller, with whom he would go on to collaborate on seven more films. The film stars George O'Brien as the introverted Crown Prince Michael, William Powell as his happy-go-lucky brother and Virginia Valli as Michael's flapper love interest Dolores. The characters played by Valli and O'Brien anticipate those found in later films by Hawks: a sexually aggressive showgirl, who is an early prototype of the [...] "Hawksian woman", and a shy man disinterested in sex, found in later roles played by Cary Grant and Gary Cooper. Paid to Love was completed by September 1926, but remained unreleased until July 1927, when it was financially unsuccessful.|$|E

[...] Philbert Ortiz Dy of ClickTheCity.com, a {{lifestyle}} guide website, rated the film 2 stars out of 5 saying that [...] "without any real investment in narrative gravity, the film would have likely been better off staying cute, leaving all the terminal illnesses to the movies that actually want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>those</b> stories." [...] Ted Claudio, a blogger at Wazzup.ph, had two ratings for the film. [...] As a film in the perspective of AlDub fans, he gave a 5 stars out 5 while for non-AlDub fans, he gave a rating of 4 stars out of 5 stating that it is good dating film [...] "for its great location, story, fun and romance." ...|$|E

However, during an interview with Cinemablend in January 2014 to promote the upcoming release of the Lucasfilm animated movie Strange Magic, Lucas revealed that ultimately, Disney chose {{not to use the}} story treatments which he had written and turned over with the acquisition, and that the company chose to create brand new stories for the upcoming movies instead: [...] "The ones that I sold to Disney, they came up to the decision that they didn't really want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>those.</b> So they made up their own. So it's not the ones that I originally wrote [...] ". No information about these has been released; however, during the previous 35 years, Lucas had given many hints about the content of the sequel trilogy, including the following (sometimes contradictory) possibilities: ...|$|E
2500|$|Mendes had {{the cast}} rehearse for three-and-a-half weeks before {{principal}} photography and shot everything in sequence and on location. Actor Michael Shannon {{said that he}} did not feel that on the set of the film there were any stars, but [...] "a group of people united by a passion for the material and wanting to honor the book". He said that Winslet and DiCaprio could only make such a good performance as a couple because they had developed a friendship since their work on Titanic. For Shannon, it was more important to prepare for the moment when he walked on the set than being concerned about the movie stars he was working with. On the fight scenes between him and Winslet, DiCaprio said, [...] "So much of what happens between Frank and April in this film is what's left unsaid. I actually found it a real joy <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>those</b> fight scenes because finally, these people were letting each other have it." [...] The shoot was so emotionally and physically exhausting for DiCaprio that he postponed his next film for two months.|$|E

2500|$|During the 2012 {{presidential primary}} campaign, {{when asked what}} the federal government’s role should be in {{responding}} to natural disasters, Romney suggested that responsibility for handling disasters should be taken from FEMA, the federal agency dedicated to disaster relief, and given to the states, or outsourced to the private sector: [...] "Every time you have an occasion to take something {{from the federal government}} and send it back to the states, that's the right direction. And if you can go even further, and send it back to the private sector, that's even better. Instead of thinking in the federal budget, what we should cut -- we should ask ourselves the opposite question. What should we keep? We should take all of what we're doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we're doing that we don't have to do? And those things we've got to stop doing, because we're borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we're taking in." [...] Asked whether by that he specifically meant disaster relief, he replied, “we cannot afford <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>those</b> things without jeopardizing the future for our kids. It is simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids, knowing full well that we'll all be dead and gone before it's paid off. It makes no sense at all.” ...|$|E
