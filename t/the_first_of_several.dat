5|$|After a brief postwar increase, Troy's {{population}} began {{a continuing}} decline. The city began <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> urban renewal plans shortly after adopting its 1962 master plan. Those plans {{called for the}} demolition of many buildings downtown, {{to be replaced by}} a new arterial road, large public housing projects and a shopping mall. After various delays, those projects were either scaled back or abandoned entirely. In the interim many businesses either closed or moved out of downtown.|$|E
5|$|Athens {{became a}} center for music in the region during the Civil War and gained further fame {{in the early twentieth}} century with the {{founding}} of the Morton Theatre, which was a major touring destination for African American performers. The city's local rock music scene can be traced to the 1950s, with live music at Allen's Hamburgers in Normaltown. International attention came in the 1970s when the B-52's began releasing <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> best-selling recordings. Athens-based rock bands have performed in a wide array of styles, and the city has never had a characteristic style of rock; most of the bands have been united only in their quirky and iconoclastic image.|$|E
5|$|By January 1943, the {{situation}} looked {{very good for}} the Soviet side. The German defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad had weakened the German front.

5|$|By the 1860s, Seton Hall College was {{continuing}} its rapid growth {{and began to}} enroll more and more students each year. However, among other difficulties, several fires on campus slowed down the growth process. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> strange fires in the University's history occurred in 1867 which destroyed the college's first building. Two decades later on March 9, 1886, another fire destroyed the university's main building.

50|$|During the 1870s Drummond built six 0-4-2 tank {{locomotives}} {{that were}} almost identical for the North British Railway after 1875. He too extended the design to produce <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> his <b>several</b> successful 0-4-4T {{designs for the}} North British and Caledonian Railway. Drummond's successful LSWR M7 class is also a direct descendant of the D1 class.|$|R

5|$|Homogenic is {{the third}} {{international}} solo album by Icelandic musician Björk, released in September 1997. Produced by Björk, Mark Bell, Guy Sigsworth, Howie B and Markus Dravs, it was released on One Little Indian Records. The music of Homogenic was a new style for Björk, focusing on similar-sounding music combining electronic beats and string instruments with songs in tribute to her native country Iceland. Homogenic was originally to be produced in her home in London, but was later recorded in Spain. Homogenic marked <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> production collaborations between Björk and Mark Bell, whom Björk would cite as {{a major influence on}} her musical career.

5|$|Hurricane Danielle was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> Cape Verde-type {{hurricane}}s to form {{during the}} 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. Danielle {{was the fourth}} named storm and third hurricane of the season. Danielle formed on August13, 2004 in the far eastern Atlantic Ocean and remained over the central Atlantic, peaking as a strong Category 2 hurricane on August16. Reaching cooler waters, Danielle began to weaken, becoming a remnant low on August21 and dissipating on August24. Danielle never approached land, although it briefly threatened the Azores as it made a northerly turn. As a result, there was no impact caused by the storm.|$|E
5|$|I-70 {{exits the}} valley through De Beque Canyon, a path carved by the Colorado River that {{separates}} the Book Cliffs from Battlement Mesa. The river and its tributaries provide the course for the ascent up the Rocky Mountains. In the canyon, I-70 enters the Beavertail Mountain Tunnel, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> tunnels built to route the freeway across the Rockies. This tunnel design features a curved sidewall, unusual for tunnels in the United States, where most tunnels feature a curved roof and flat side-walls. Engineers borrowed a European design to give the tunnel added strength. After the canyon winds past the Book Cliffs, the highway follows the Colorado River through a valley containing the communities of Parachute and Rifle.|$|E

5|$|In 1221 Llywelyn {{took control}} of {{neighbouring}} Meirionnydd from his son, Gruffydd; Llywelyn had previously placed Gruffydd in power there, but {{the father and son}} had fallen out. The prince then began to build the castle of Castell y Bere with the intent of controlling the local population and securing his new south-west border, which included the mountain trade routes between Gwynedd, Powys Wenwynwyn and Deheubarth. Castell y Bere was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> stone castles built by Llywelyn and the initial castle consisted of several towers positioned around a courtyard, situated on a rocky hillock in the Dysynni Valley near Cadair Idris.|$|E
5|$|In 1244, Alexander made <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> {{attempts}} by Scottish monarchs {{to purchase the}} Hebrides from the Kingdom of Norway. It was following this unsuccessful bid that Hákon sent Eóghan into the Isles in 1249, which in turn led to Eóghan's expulsion from the Scottish-mainland when Alexander launched a full-scale summer invasion into Argyll. Alexander's sudden death in the Hebrides brought an abrupt end to his westward invasion, {{and it was not}} until the 1260s that a Scottish king again attempted to impose his authority into the Isles.|$|E

The best local ironstone (with the highest iron content) was exhausted soon after, so the company arranged for extensions to the local railways, such as the Stockton and Darlington Railway. These allowed it to access new sources of ironstone, including, from 1851 onwards, ore from the Cleveland Ironstone Formation near Eston, Cleveland.|$|E
