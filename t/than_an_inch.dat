5|$|June 6, 1995– The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Allison produce light showers in some locations, amounting to less <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|E
5|$|September 30, 2001: Thunderstorms {{from the}} {{remnants}} of Hurricane Juliette caused minor damage to California and brought rain of less <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> (25mm) to the area.|$|E
5|$|June 1990: The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Boris briefly caused heavy rainfall in southern California. This {{was one of}} the reasons why it was the wettest June in San Diego, since record-keeping began in 1850. Despite this, less <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> (25mm) of rain fell in most locations.|$|E

50|$|In Engineering Electromagnetics, Hayt {{points out}} that in a power station a busbar for {{alternating}} current at 60 Hz with <b>a</b> radius larger <b>than</b> one-third of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> (8 mm) is a waste of copper, and in practice bus bars for heavy AC current are rarely more <b>than</b> half <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> (12 mm) thick except for mechanical reasons.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Pleistocene age varves at Scarborough Bluffs, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The {{thickest}} varves {{are more}} <b>than</b> half <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> thick.|$|R
5|$|Leeds {{has limited}} {{examples}} of Brutalism, one such being the Leeds International Swimming Pool (designed by disgraced architect John Poulson). until {{the commencement of}} its demolition in Autumn 2009, following its closure in October 2007. The Leeds International Pool was not without its design flaws, the pool size was miscalculated and was less <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> too narrow to qualify for Olympic Standard meaning that it never held the competitions the council had hoped for and it {{spent much of the}} 1960s closed while problems with its construction were rectified.|$|E
5|$|Skyler (Anna Gunn) calls Walter {{to inquire}} about buying the car wash where Walter once worked, which they plan {{to use as a}} front {{business}} for Walter's drug money. When Walter fails to act on the purchase, Skyler starts doing her own detailed research about the business's expenses and revenues. She later approaches the car wash owner, Bogdan (Marius Stan), about the proposed purchase, but he angrily rejects her, making sexist remarks and condemning Walter for having insulted Bogdan when he quit the car wash. Meanwhile, Marie (Betsy Brandt) continues struggling to deal with her husband Hank's (Dean Norris) deepening depression as he copes with physical therapy from having been shot. The bed-ridden and bitter Hank constantly ignores or insults Marie and, even after celebrating a successful session with his physical therapist, he refuses to share any of that excitement with Marie. Meanwhile, after three straight days of partying, Jesse tries to keep hanging out with Badger and Skinny Pete, but they are exhausted and go home, along with all of the other guests in Jesse's house. Alone with his thoughts, a depressed Jesse breaks down and cries, sitting less <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> away from his speakers at an extremely high volume.|$|E
25|$|STS-52, 1992: Portion of bipod ramp, jackpad lost. 290 total tile marks, 16 greater <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|E
50|$|After her death, the Burton Tower's {{structure}} was modified, {{with the addition}} of stops to prevent windows from opening more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> few <b>inches.</b>|$|R
50|$|Colonies of Oculina diffusa {{are usually}} about 30 cm in {{diameter}} and have twisting narrow branches less <b>than</b> half <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> in diameter. Colonies have been recorded at temperatures ranging from 13-31 degrees Celsius.|$|R
2500|$|The ROTC building, now {{nothing more}} <b>than</b> <b>a</b> few <b>inches</b> of charcoal, was {{surrounded}} by National Guardsmen. They were all on one knee and pointing their rifles at...us! [...] Then they fired.|$|R
25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{feature of}} the books was a flipbook composed of the bottom right-hand corners {{of all of the}} book's pages. A step of the cover morph was printed on each page, less <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> tall, in black-and-white. When the pages were flipped from front to back, the narrating Animorph could be seen morphing into the animal.|$|E
25|$|Surface {{roughness}} {{determines how}} much of the reflection is specular and how much diffuses, controlling how sharp or blurry the image will be. For perfectly specular reflection, the surface roughness must be kept smaller than the wavelength of the light. Microwaves, which sometimes have a wavelength greater <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> (2.5 cm) can reflect specularly off a metal screen-door, while visible light, having wavelengths of only a few hundred nanometers (a few millionths of an inch), must meet a very smooth surface to produce specular reflection.|$|E
25|$|The Drever's most {{noticeable}} characteristic are its long body and short legs, {{inherited from the}} Westphalian Dachsbracke, but as a working dog these features are not exaggerated. It has short fur, and is of any color with white markings (but not all white, which {{has been linked to}} deafness.) The breed has the typical drop (hanging) ears of a hound, and a long tail. The maximum height of a Drever is 38cm (15 ins) at the withers, which is about 15cm (approx. 6 ins) shorter than a long legged hunting hound with the same size body. The Westphalian Dachsbracke is about 2cm (less <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch)</b> shorter than the Drever.|$|E
50|$|Mahamoggallana's {{stone box}} {{enclosed}} another steatite casket, {{similar to that}} of Sariputra but slightly smaller and with a softer surface. Inside it were two bone relics of Mahamoggallana, smaller than those of Sariputra, the larger of them being less <b>than</b> half <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> long.|$|R
50|$|It is less <b>than</b> half <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> across, {{and lives}} inside the gills of an oyster or a clam. It uses the oyster for {{protection}} and {{lives on the}} food that the oyster gets for itself. It is found in oysters in the North Atlantic Ocean.|$|R

500|$|September 1939: Two {{tropical}} systems {{entered the}} state during the month. On September 4, {{the remnants of}} a former hurricane entered southwest Arizona, near Yuma. More than [...] of precipitation fell in northwest Arizona, with many parts of the state collecting more <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> of rain. This same system produced more than twice the average annual rainfall in Imperial Valley, California. On the 11th, {{the remnants of a}} separate system also passed over southwest Arizona.|$|E
500|$|Dunlap {{was known}} during his {{baseball}} career by the nicknames [...] "Sure Shot" [...] and [...] "King of Second Basemen". [...] Most accounts {{indicate that the}} [...] "Sure Shot" [...] nickname arose from Dunlap's powerful and accurate throws to first base. King Kelly reportedly gave Dunlap the [...] "Sure Shot" [...] nickname after watching him throw. One account described Dunlap's throwing prowess as follows: [...] "ndless practice made him adept as a monkey at grabbing a sizzling ground ball in either hand and firing it off from the very spot he seized it. His whistling throws, which seemed to clear the grass {{by no more than}} half a foot, never seemed to lose more <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> or two." ...|$|E
500|$|At 2:27p.m., Reagan {{exited the}} hotel through [...] "President's Walk" [...] and its T Street NW exit toward his waiting {{limousine}} as Hinckley waited within {{the crowd of}} admirers. The Secret Service had extensively screened those attending the president's speech. In a [...] "colossal mistake", the agency allowed an unscreened group to stand within [...] of him, behind a rope line. Unexpectedly, Reagan passed {{right in front of}} Hinckley. Believing he would never get a better chance, Hinckley fired a Röhm RG-14 [...]22LR blue steel revolver six times in 1.7 seconds, missing the president with all six shots. The first bullet hit White House Press Secretary James Brady in the head and the second hit District of Columbia police officer Thomas Delahanty {{in the back of his}} neck as he turned to protect Reagan. Hinckley now had a clear shot at the president, but the third bullet overshot him and hit the window of a building across the street. As Special Agent In Charge Jerry Parr quickly pushed Reagan into the limousine, the fourth bullet hit Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy in the abdomen as he spread his body over Reagan to make himself a target. The fifth bullet hit the bullet-resistant glass of the window on the open side door of the limousine. The sixth and final bullet ricocheted off the armored side of the limousine and hit the president in the left underarm, grazing a rib and lodging in his lung, causing it to partially collapse, and stopping less <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> (25mm) from his heart. [...] Parr's prompt reaction had saved Reagan from being hit in the head.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gestation}} {{period of a}} llama is 11.5 months (350 days). Dams (female llamas) do not lick off their babies, as they have an attached tongue that does not reach outside of the mouth more <b>than</b> half <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> (...) [...] Rather, they will nuzzle and hum to their newborns.|$|R
50|$|It {{was widely}} {{predicted}} by both engineers and laymen {{that such a}} structure would collapse when the wooden centring was removed, but on removal the bridge settled less <b>than</b> half <b>an</b> <b>inch.</b> It has outlived the railway and remains in excellent condition today. It is now grade II listed.|$|R
50|$|The average {{projection}} {{and size}} of human female nipples is slightly more <b>than</b> 3/8 of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> (10mm). This is equal to about five stacked American quarters.|$|R
2500|$|Most {{jellyfish}} are marine animals, {{although a}} few hydromedusae inhabit freshwater. [...] The best known freshwater example is the cosmopolitan hydrozoan jellyfish, Craspedacusta sowerbii. It is less <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> (2.5cm) in diameter, colorless {{and it does not}} sting.|$|E
2500|$|On June 22, 1999, a 24-year-old {{medical student}} from Michigan {{apparently}} {{set out from}} a remote trailhead where his rental car was found. [...] Temperatures dropped 15 degrees and more <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> of rain fell beginning the next day. [...] Ten days after his presumed disappearance, searching began with up to 70 rescuers combing the area. [...] Additional searches included cadaver dogs and psychics. [...] His body was never found.|$|E
2500|$|Tomotley first {{appears in}} the European colonial {{historical}} record in 1756 under the governorship of Attakullakulla. That same year, a small English force under Captain Raymond Demeré arrived {{in the area to}} build and garrison Fort Loudoun. [...] The garrison was greeted at Tomotley by Kanagatucko (Old Hop), who told Demeré, [...] "I am now old and lie upon a bad bearskin. My life is not more <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> long." [...] William de Brahm, who designed the fort, resided at Tomotley while the fort was being constructed in late 1756.|$|E
50|$|The {{gestation}} {{period of a}} llama is 11.5 months (350 days). Dams (female llamas) do not lick off their babies, as they have an attached tongue that does not reach outside of the mouth more <b>than</b> half <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> (0.5 in). Rather, they will nuzzle and hum to their newborns.|$|R
50|$|Temperatures {{generally}} drop {{significantly in}} October, while rainfall rises from less <b>than</b> half <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> to nearly 5 inches average per month. This trend continues through late autumn and winter, with a marked drop in precipitation beginning in April which coincides with a gradual rise in temperature into late spring and summer.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{significant}} variation in rainfall throughout the year, with December and January receiving {{a mix of}} rainfall and snow, averaging 9.06 and 7.94 inches respectively. Rainfall during summer is, on average, less <b>than</b> half <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> each month with July receiving the lowest monthly average precipitation {{of the year at}} [...]07 inches.|$|R
2500|$|Using {{the most}} basic {{typesetting}} and page-layout tools, Brand and his colleagues created {{the first issue of}} The Whole Earth Catalog in 1968. [...] In subsequent issues, its production values gradually improved. [...] Its outsize pages measured 11×14 inches (28×36cm). [...] Later editions were more <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> thick. [...] The early editions were published by the Portola Institute, headed by Richard Raymond. The so-called Last Whole Earth Catalogue (June 1971) won the first U.S. National Book Award in category Contemporary Affairs.There was a [...] "Contemporary" [...] or [...] "Current" [...] award category from 1972 to 1980.|$|E
2500|$|Snowfall in South Carolina is {{somewhat}} uncommon {{in most of}} the state, while coastal areas receive less <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> (2.5cm) annually on average. It is not uncommon for areas along the coast (especially the southern coast) to receive no recordable snowfall in a given year. The interior receives a little more snow, although nowhere in the state averages more than [...] of snow annually. The mountains of extreme northwestern South Carolina tend to have the most substantial snow accumulation. Freezing rain and ice tend to be more common than snow {{in many areas of the}} state. Road bridges in South Carolina are commonly marked, [...] "Bridge ices before road." ...|$|E
2500|$|Five-pin bowling is {{a popular}} {{variation}} in Canada, and pinsetters fall into two categories: [...] string and free-fall. [...] String pinsetters are more prevalent, and consist of machines attached {{to the head of}} each pin, by means of a cord. [...] Essentially, the pinsetter is triggered by the movement of any pin by more <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> or two. [...] With that, the machine lowers a guard, pulls up all 5 pins, and resets those that did not move. [...] There is, on average, a three-second lag from when the pins were knocked down to when the guard is lowered. [...] The pit floor is angled such that the ball is gravity-fed to a track that leads to an elevator. [...] The elevator lifts the ball to the return track.|$|E
50|$|After University of Michigan Regent Sarah Goddard Power {{committed}} suicide by jumping {{to her death}} from the eighth floor of Burton Tower in 1987, the structure was slightly modified, such as the addition of stops to prevent windows from opening more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> few <b>inches.</b>|$|R
60|$|By way of {{answer to}} this tirade Mrs. Strudwarden stooped down again and kissed the irresponsive brown nose. It was the action {{of a woman with}} a beautifully meek nature, who would, however, send the whole world to the stake sooner <b>than</b> yield <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> where she knew herself to be in the right.|$|R
50|$|April 2006: Kodak {{introduced}} the Kodak EasyShare V610 Dual Lens Digital Camera, {{at that time}} the world’s smallest 10× (38-380 mm) optical zoom camera at less <b>than</b> 2.5 cm (<b>an</b> <b>inch)</b> thick.|$|R
