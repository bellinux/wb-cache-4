In variable output systems such as automobile engines, exhaust gas pressure at idle, low engine speeds, or low throttle is usually insufficient to drive the turbine.

25|$|The R32 Skyline GT-R N1 street car {{marked the}} N1 engine's {{introduction}} to the consumer. R32, 33, and 34 N1 street cars were known for lack of amenities and their light weight. The R33 N1 engine and turbochargers were slightly revised, and the R34 N1 engine saw further improvement. The camshaft timing was altered slightly for more torque. R33 and R34 N1 turbochargers are the same size however R34 N1s use a ball bearing center section. NISMO states the ball bearings in the R34 N1 allow them <b>to</b> <b>spool</b> 400rpm faster than R33 N1.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the last}} few seconds, the {{aircraft}} climbed to 3,090 feet. The Captain put in 52 degrees of bank to turn the aircraft, and also made some nose down inputs. Therefore, the aircraft pitched down, speed increased and auto thrust commanded the engines <b>to</b> <b>spool</b> down to keep airspeed on the target speed. The aircraft started to descend at a high rate. Unfortunately in his panic, the Captain continued to move the heading knob without actually looking at it, but failed to pull the knob to activate it. When he did activate it, the aircraft turned towards the heading knob that had been rotated too far, to 25 degrees, and stayed on that course until end of recording. At 04:40:49 the Captain said to the First Officer [...] "Why the aircraft is not turning left?" [...] The aircraft then slammed into Margala Hills and exploded. The First Officer's last words could be heard saying to the Captain [...] "Sir we are going down! Sir we are going do—".|$|E

50|$|This {{improves}} average access times, with {{a worst-case}} seek request needing spool through only {{a maximum of}} half the tape's length. In comparison, traditional formats may need <b>to</b> <b>spool</b> through the full tape length, doubling the time-to-seek of IBM's product. This family of drives, alongside the StorageTek 9840, {{may be the only}} modern tape storage products taking this mid-tape load-point approach.|$|E
50|$|A {{noteworthy}} {{feature of}} the LINC was the LINCtape. It was a fundamental part of the machine design, not an optional peripheral, and the machine's OS relied on it. The LINCtape {{can be compared to}} a linear diskette with a slow seek time. The magnetic tape drives on large machines of the day stored large quantities of data, took minutes <b>to</b> <b>spool</b> from end to end, but could not reliably update blocks of data in place. In contrast, the LINCtape was a small, nimble device which stored about 400K, had a fixed formatting track allowing data to be repeatedly read and re-written to the same locations, and took less than a minute <b>to</b> <b>spool</b> {{from one end to the}} other. The tape was formatted in fixed-sized blocks, and was used to hold a directory and file system. A single hardware instruction could seek and then read or write multiple tape blocks all in one operation.|$|E

50|$|Diversion of {{exhaust gases}} regulates the turbine speed, {{which in turn}} regulates the {{rotating}} speed of the compressor. The primary function of the wastegate is to regulate the maximum boost pressure in turbocharger systems, to protect the engine and the turbocharger. One advantage of installing a remote mount wastegate to a free-float (or non-WG) turbo includes allowance for a smaller A/R turbine housing, resulting in less lag time before the turbo begins <b>to</b> <b>spool</b> and create boost.|$|E
50|$|Starting {{with the}} 2014 season, Formula 1 {{switched}} to a new 1.6 liter turbocharged V6 formula that uses turbo-compounding. The engines use a single turbocharger that is connected to an electric motor/generator called the MGU-H. On deceleration, the MGU-H acts as a generator, converting wasted mechanical energy from the turbine into electrical energy that is stored in a battery. When the car accelerates, the MGU-H acts as a motor, using the stored electrical energy <b>to</b> <b>spool</b> up the turbine, eliminating lag.|$|E

50|$|Calculating the {{perimeter}} has several practical applications. A calculated perimeter is {{the length of}} fence required to surround a yard or garden. The perimeter of a wheel (its circumference) describes how far it will roll in one revolution.

50|$|In {{the second}} half of 1984 the Italian CB-DT engine was {{replaced}} with the fully Daihatsu-built CB60 engine. The CB60, with a smaller IHI RHB32 charger and a more suitable 8:1 compression ratio (with a 0.5 bar charge, rather than the 0.37 bar used in the CB-DT), reached max power at 5,700 rpm. Tractability at lower engine speeds also improved since the smaller charger was more willing <b>to</b> <b>spool</b> up; this had been an area of concern with the earlier engine which did not {{have a whole lot of}} power beneath 3,500 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Although it cannot {{match the}} {{sustained}} {{rate of fire}} of an electric Gatling gun like the M61 Vulcan GAU, because it doesn't need <b>to</b> <b>spool</b> up, its initial rate of fire is higher. It requires no external power source to operate, but is instead powered by the recoiling of the floating barrels, somewhat like {{the action of the}} German MG-42. The Gast principle has been little used in the West, but was popular in the former Soviet Union on a variety of weapons. It is reported to be a very reliable, robust weapon easily maintained in the field.|$|E

The plane stalled, clipped trees, hit an electric power line and impacted the ground in an inverted attitude in a wheat field. It exploded and burst into flames. The plane lost contact with Multan International Airport control tower two minutes after takeoff. Everyone on board died instantly. It was reported that the post-impact fire was so intense that no-one on board could have survived.|$|E
