40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the framework of}} our intelligent video production, which has functions for multimodal data acquisition, accumulation to a database, and intelligent video editing. Since multimodal approach is most effective and promising for semi-/automatic video production, we first developed a prototype of multimodal acquisition system and database in which <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> are recorded in a multimodal way. By consulting it, we can intensively investigate <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> in typical situations. We are developing algorithms for detecting typical <b>human</b> <b>behaviors,</b> for example, deictic movements. The behaviors are good keys to detecting the "focus", which means the most important portions to be recorded and to {{be presented to the}} audience. Thus, intelligent video production becomes possible by these intelligent processes. We briefly introduce, in this paper, our idea for detecting <b>the</b> focus of <b>human</b> <b>behaviors</b> in videotaping and emphasizing it. 1 Introduction Movies, TV programs, [...] ...|$|R
