5|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there is much to suggest that {{this is the kind of}} environment in which the <b>tetrapods</b> evolved. Early fossil <b>tetrapods</b> have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive <b>tetrapods</b> in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{possibility}} of respiration across the skin combined with small size, all known lungless <b>tetrapods</b> are amphibians. The majority of salamander species are lungless salamanders, which respirate through their skin and tissues lining their mouth. This necessarily restrict their size: all are small and rather thread-like in appearance, maximising skin surface relative to body volume. Other known lungless <b>tetrapods</b> are the Bornean flat-headed frog and Atretochoana eiselti, a caecilian.|$|E
5|$|Initially making only {{tentative}} forays onto land, <b>tetrapods</b> {{adapted to}} terrestrial environments {{over time and}} spent longer periods away from the water. It {{is also possible that}} the adults started to spend some time on land (as the skeletal modifications in early <b>tetrapods</b> such as Ichthyostega suggests) to bask in the sun close to the water's edge, while otherwise being mostly aquatic.|$|E

5|$|Most {{amphibians}} today remain semiaquatic, {{living the}} first stage of their lives as fish-like tadpoles. Several groups of <b>tetrapods,</b> such as the snakes and cetaceans, have lost some or all of their limbs. In addition, many <b>tetrapods</b> have returned to partially aquatic or fully aquatic lives throughout the history of the group (modern examples of fully aquatic <b>tetrapods</b> include cetaceans and sirenians). The first returns to an aquatic lifestyle may have occurred as early as the Carboniferous Period whereas other returns occurred as recently as the Cenozoic, as in cetaceans, pinnipeds, and several modern amphibians.|$|E
5|$|The Devonian <b>tetrapods</b> {{went through}} two major {{bottlenecks}} during {{what is known}} as the Late Devonian extinction; one at the end of the Frasnian stage, and one twice as large at the end of the following Famennian stage. These events of extinctions led to the disappearance of primitive <b>tetrapods</b> with fish-like features like Ichthyostega and their primary more aquatic relatives. When <b>tetrapods</b> reappear in the fossil record after the Devonian extinctions, the adult forms are all fully adapted to a terrestrial existence, with later species secondary adapted to an aquatic lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The {{nostrils}} in most bony fish {{differ from}} those of <b>tetrapods.</b> Normally, bony fish have four nares (nasal openings), one naris behind the other on each side. As the fish swims, water flows into the forward pair, across the olfactory tissue, and out through the posterior openings. This is true not only of ray-finned fish but also of the coelacanth, a fish included in the Sarcopterygii, the group that also includes the <b>tetrapods.</b> In contrast, the <b>tetrapods</b> have only one pair of nares externally but also sport a pair of internal nares, called choanae, allowing them to draw air through the nose. Lungfish are also sarcopterygians with internal nostrils, but these are sufficiently different from tetrapod choanae that they have long been recognized as an independent development.|$|E
50|$|Blue Beach is {{the type}} {{locality}} for the apparent gap in the <b>tetrapod</b> fossil record known as Romer's gap. Sir William Logan, the first Director of the Geological Survey of Canada, found footprints from a <b>tetrapod</b> in 1841.

40|$|The ichnofacies model {{provides}} the main framework {{to understand the}} paleoenvironmental significance of trace fossils. Traditionally focused on invertebrate trace fossil, the ichnofacies model has only recently expanded to include <b>tetrapod</b> footprints. The purpose of this work is to discuss the role of <b>tetrapod</b> footprints {{in the development of}} continental ichnofacies models, {{as well as in the}} reconstruction of sedimentary paleoenvironments. An integrative perspective was employed to tackle this problem, taking into account depositional environments, as well as <b>tetrapod</b> and invertebrate trace-fossil data. The case studies that constitute the empiric base of this research project are based on trace-fossil associations studied in different lithostratigraphic units of Argentina, complemented with other ichnologic associations reported elsewhere. Proposed models on <b>tetrapod</b> ichnofacies have established a relationship between fossil footprint associations and sedimentary paleoenvironments, but no insight on the controlling environmental parameters has been provided. However, available data suggest that the distribution of <b>tetrapod</b> footprints and invertebrate trace fossils are not controlled by the same paleoenvironmental factors. Contrary to local environmental parameters involved in the distribution of invertebrate trace fossils, the distribution of <b>tetrapod</b> trace fossils in terrestrial environments seems to be more related to key environmental regional-scale parameters, such as climate and resource availability.

5|$|Tiktaalik is a genus of extinct sarcopterygian (lobe-finned fish) {{from the}} Late Devonian period, with many {{features}} akin {{to those of}} <b>tetrapods</b> (four-legged animals). It {{is one of several}} lines of ancient sarcopterygians to develop adaptations to the oxygen-poor shallow water habitats of its time—adaptations that led to the evolution of <b>tetrapods.</b> Well-preserved fossils were found in 2004 on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada.|$|E

5|$|By the Visean (mid-Carboniferous) stage, {{the early}} <b>tetrapods</b> had {{radiated}} into {{at least three}} or four main branches. Recognizable basal-group <b>tetrapods</b> {{are representative of the}} temnospondyls (e.g. Eryops) lepospondyls (e.g. Diplocaulus), anthracosaurs, which were the relatives and ancestors of the Amniota, and possibly the baphetids, which are thought to be related to temnospondyls and whose status as a main branch is yet unresolved. Depending on which authorities one follows, modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) are most probably derived from either temnospondyls or lepospondyls (or possibly both, although this is now a minority position).|$|E

40|$|ZnO <b>tetrapod</b> {{nanowires}} {{were prepared}} by thermal evaporation of Zn {{in the flow}} of different carrier gases (argon, nitrogen, humidified argon and humidified nitrogen). The optical properties of the <b>tetrapod</b> nanowires were investigated by low-temperature photoluminescence measurements, reflectance measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that the type of gas significantly affects the optical properties of the fabricated <b>tetrapod</b> nanowires. The origin of the differences in the photoluminescence spectra of <b>tetrapod</b> nanowires fabricated with different carrier gases is discussed. The addition of water vapor to the carrier gas affected the photoluminescence and XPS spectra for both N- 2 and Ar carrier gases, and the changes observed in the XPS spectra indicated possible incorporation of hydrogen in these samples.

5|$|Estimates {{published}} {{after the}} discovery of Zachelmie tracks suggested that digited <b>tetrapods</b> may have appeared as early as 427.4 Ma ago and questioned attempts to read absolute timing of evolutionary events in early tetrapod evolution from stratigraphy.|$|E
5|$|Frogs and {{all other}} living <b>tetrapods</b> have a {{rod-like}} bone called the stapes that aids in hearing by transferring vibrations from the ear drum —or homologous tympanum— to the inner ear. Temnospondyls also have a stapes, which projects into the otic cavity. The stapes likely evolved from the hyomandibula of lobe-finned fishes. The positioning of the stapes and {{the shape of the}} otic region suggests that the tympani of temnospondyls and frogs are homologous, but the tympani of these amphibians are no longer considered homologous with the hearing systems of reptiles, birds, and mammals. Therefore, ear structures in temnospondyls were not ancestral to those of all other <b>tetrapods.</b>|$|E
5|$|If early <b>tetrapods</b> {{lived in}} freshwater, {{and if they}} {{lost the ability to}} produce urea and used ammonia only, they would have to evolve it from scratch again later. Not a single species of all the ray-finned fishes living today has been able to do that, so it is not likely the <b>tetrapods</b> would have done so either. Terrestrial animals that can only produce ammonia would have to drink constantly, making a life on land {{impossible}} (a few exceptions exist, as some terrestrial woodlice can excrete their nitrogenous waste as ammonia gas). This probably also was a problem at the start when the <b>tetrapods</b> started to spend time out of water, but eventually the urea system would dominate completely. Because of this it is not likely they emerged in freshwater (unless they first migrated into freshwater habitats and then migrated onto land so shortly after that they still retained the ability to make urea), although some species never left, or returned to, the water could of course have adapted to freshwater lakes and rivers.|$|E

40|$|The {{lower jaw}} of an {{unidentified}} Pennsylvanian (Late Carboniferous) <b>tetrapod</b> from Nova Scotia [...] the "Parrsboro jaw" [...] is redescribed {{in the light}} of recent <b>tetrapod</b> discoveries and work on evolution of <b>tetrapod</b> mandibular morphology and placed {{for the first time in}} a numerical cladistics analysis. All phylogenetic analyses place the jaw in a crownward polytomy of baphetids, temnospondyls, and embolomeres. Several features resemble baphetids and temnospondyls including dermal ornamentation, absence of coronoid teeth, and presence of coronoid shagreen. Dentary dentition is most similar to Baphetes. An adsymphysial toothplate may not preclude temnospondyl affinity. An apparent large exomeckelian fenestra, with the dorsal foraminal margins formed by an unossified element, echoes the morphology of the stem <b>tetrapod</b> Sigournea and is unusually primitive given the other features of the jaw. The jaw may thus provide an example of an intermediate stage in Meckelian element evolution...|$|R

5|$|Temnospondyls {{and other}} early <b>tetrapods</b> have rounded otic notches {{in the back}} of the skull that project into the cheek region. In life, the otic notch would have been covered by a {{membrane}} called the tympanum, which is seen as a disk-like area in living frogs. The tympanum is involved in hearing, and is similar to the ear drum of more advanced <b>tetrapods.</b> It was traditionally thought that the tympanum developed very early in tetrapod evolution as a hearing organ and progressed to form the ear drum of amniotes. Thus, temnospondyls possessed a hearing system supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tetrapods</b> {{have their}} {{root in the}} early Devonian tetrapodomorph fish. Primitive <b>tetrapods</b> {{developed}} from an osteolepid tetrapodomorph lobe-finned fish (sarcopterygian-crossopterygian), with a two-lobed brain in a flattened skull. The coelacanth group represents marine sarcopterygians that never acquired these shallow-water adaptations. The sarcopterygians apparently took two different lines of descent and are accordingly separated into two major groups: the Actinistia (including the coelacanths) and the Rhipidistia (which include extinct lines of lobe-finned fishes that evolved into the lungfish and the tetrapodomorphs).|$|E

5|$|Unlike semiaquatic temnospondyls, {{terrestrial}} temnospondyls have skulls {{that are}} adapted for biting land-living prey. The sutures between {{the bones of}} the skull in the dissorophoid Phonerpeton are able to withstand a high degree of compression. Compressive forces would have been experienced when biting down on prey. Earlier aquatic <b>tetrapods</b> and tetrapod ancestors differ from temnospondyls like Phonerpeton in that their skulls were also built to withstand tension. This tension would have been experienced during suction feeding underwater. Temnospondyls like Phonerpeton were among the first <b>tetrapods</b> that were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by biting.|$|E

50|$|A notable {{characteristic}} {{that make a}} <b>tetrapod's</b> skull different from a fish's are the relative frontal and rear portion lengths.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A nanoscale, visible-light, self-sensing stress probe {{would be}} highly {{desirable}} {{in a variety of}} biological, imaging, and materials engineering applications, especially a device that does not alter the mechanical properties of the material it seeks to probe. Here we present the CdSe−CdS <b>tetrapod</b> quantum dot, incorporated into polymer matrices via electrospinning, as an in situ luminescent stress probe for the mechanical properties of polymer fibers. The mechanooptical sensing performance is enhanced with increasing nanocrystal concentration while causing minimal change in the mechanical properties even up to 20 wt % incorporation. The <b>tetrapod</b> nanoprobe is elastic and recoverable and undergoes no permanent change in sensing ability even upon many cycles of loading to failure. Direct comparisons to side-by-side traditional mechanical tests further validate the <b>tetrapod</b> as a luminescent stress probe. The <b>tetrapod</b> fluorescence stress−strain curve shape matches well with uniaxial stress−strain curves measured mechanically at all filler concentrations reported...|$|R
