5|$|During the {{following}} decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated {{by a large}} number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001 several experiments, most notably BOOMERanG, found the shape of <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>to</b> be spatially almost flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 {{a debate}} {{took place between}} Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis (the Great Debate), {{concerning}} {{the nature of the}} Milky Way, spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>Universe.</b> <b>To</b> support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula is an external galaxy, Curtis noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in the Milky Way, as well as the significant Doppler shift.|$|E
5|$|Independent {{lines of}} {{evidence}} from Type Ia supernovae and the CMB {{imply that the}} universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as dark energy, which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused the expansion of <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>to</b> slowly begin to accelerate.|$|E

5|$|Most {{galaxies in}} the Universe are gravitationally bound {{to a number of}} other galaxies. These form a fractal-like {{hierarchical}} distribution of clustered structures, with the smallest such associations being termed groups. A group of galaxies is {{the most common type of}} galactic cluster, and these formations contain a majority of the galaxies (as well as most of the baryonic mass) in <b>the</b> <b>Universe.</b> <b>To</b> remain gravitationally bound to such a group, each member galaxy must have a sufficiently low velocity to prevent it from escaping (see Virial theorem). If there is insufficient kinetic energy, however, the group may evolve into a smaller number of galaxies through mergers.|$|E
5|$|Since its premiere, 2001: A Space Odyssey {{has been}} {{analyzed}} and interpreted by professional film critics, amateur writers and science fiction fans, {{virtually all of}} whom have mentioned its deliberate ambiguity. Questions about 2001 range from uncertainty about its deeper philosophical implications about humanity's origins and final destiny in <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> <b>to</b> interpreting elements of the film's more enigmatic scenes such as the meaning of the monolith, or the final fate of astronaut David Bowman. There are also simpler and more mundane questions about what drives the plot, in particular the causes of Hal's breakdown (explained in earlier drafts but kept mysterious in the film).|$|E
5|$|The initial hot, dense {{state is}} called the Planck epoch, a brief period {{extending}} from time zero to one Planck time unit of approximately 10−43 seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of matter and all types of energy were concentrated into a dense state, where gravitation {{is believed to have}} been as strong as the other fundamental forces, and all the forces may have been unified. Since the Planck epoch, the Universe has been expanding to its present form, possibly with a very brief period of cosmic inflation which caused <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>to</b> reach a much larger size in less than 10−32 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Astronomical {{observations}} of the cosmological expansion rate allow {{the total amount of}} matter in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>to</b> be estimated, although the nature of that matter remains mysterious in part. About 90% of all matter appears to be dark matter, which has mass (or, equivalently, gravitational influence), but does not interact electromagnetically and, hence, cannot be observed directly. There is no generally accepted description of this new kind of matter, within the framework of known particle physics or otherwise. Observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements of the cosmic background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a cosmological constant resulting in an acceleration of cosmic expansion or, equivalently, by a form of energy with an unusual equation of state, known as dark energy, the nature of which remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s and the 1980s, various {{observations}} {{showed that}} there is not sufficient visible matter in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>to</b> account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, gravitational lensing studies, and X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Mario {{is invited}} to the centennial Star Festival by Princess Peach to {{celebrate}} the comet that passes overhead, Bowser invades the Mushroom Kingdom with a surprise attack in a fleet of airships. Summoning a gigantic flying saucer, Peach's entire castle is removed from its foundations and is lifted into outer space. Mario is still at the castle's base until Kamek, one of Bowser's minions, launches Mario onto a small planet with his magic. On the planet, he meets an enchantress named Rosalina and her companions, the Lumas. Rosalina is a watcher of the stars, who uses the Comet Observatory to travel across the universe. However, Bowser has stolen all of the Power Stars that act as the Observatory's power source, rendering it immobile. Bestowed {{with the power to}} travel through space through one of the Lumas, Mario sets off on a journey across <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>to</b> reclaim the Power Stars and restore power to Rosalina's observatory.

5|$|The {{proportions}} {{of all types}} of matter and energy have changed over the history of the Universe. Today, ordinary matter, which includes atoms, stars, galaxies, and life, accounts for only 4.9% of the contents of the Universe. The present overall density of this type of matter is very low, roughly 4.5 × 10−31 grams per cubic centimetre, corresponding to a density of the order of only one proton for every four cubic meters of volume. The nature of both dark energy and dark matter is unknown. Dark matter, a mysterious form of matter that has not yet been identified, accounts for 26.8% of the contents. Dark energy, which is the energy of empty space and is causing the expansion of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>to</b> accelerate, accounts for the remaining 68.3% of the contents.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the first}} series to feature Matt Smith as the {{eleventh}} incarnation of the Doctor, an alien Time Lord who travels through time and space in his TARDIS, {{which appears to be}} a British police box on the outside. Karen Gillan is also introduced as the Doctor's new companion Amy Pond, with her fiancé Rory Williams portrayed by Arthur Darvill, who is in seven episodes, and travels with the Doctor and Amy and is also a regular in the next series. Alex Kingston returns as River Song, a mysterious woman from the Doctor's future who summons the Doctor twice in this series. The main story arc concerns a pattern of cracks in the universe which appear over several episodes, sometimes going unnoticed by the characters. It is discovered that they have the power to erase things from existence, and this happens to Rory, causing Amy to forget him. In the series finale it is revealed that the cracks were caused by the TARDIS exploding and the Doctor is forced to reboot <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>to</b> the state which it was in without the cracks.|$|E
