5|$|Clinton {{was inaugurated}} as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less {{than a month}} after taking office, he signed <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act of 1993, which {{required}} large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support, and was popular with the public.|$|E
25|$|In {{what was}} to be a forerunner of <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act of 1993, then teacher Ackerman {{successfully}} sued the Board in a landmark case which established the right of either parent to receive unpaid leave for child care. A quarter of a century later, now a Congressman, Ackerman in the House-Senate Conference Committee, signed the report of <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act which became the law of the land.|$|E

25|$|The CWA {{opposed the}} 1988 Act for Better Child Care (H.R. 3660), {{which would have}} {{provided}} government-sponsored child care for families in which both parents are working. The CWA also testified against <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act {{on the premise that}} it was biased against those who could not afford to take leave.|$|E
25|$|Women in the {{workforce}} have tripled and as their numbers increase it has been hard for both mothers and fathers {{to be able to}} take care of their own newborn child or a sick family member. <b>The</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act of 1993 has allowed for workers to have up to 12 weeks a year to leave work.|$|E
30|$|Despite the {{potential}} risk, many patients with ITP need only close medical observation without special treatment. Because spontaneous bleeding is rare unless {{the number of}} platelets is <[*] 30, 000 /μL, therapeutic intervention is typically performed only when the platelet count falls below this level [4]. Therefore, a surgical procedure is not necessarily safe for a patient who is not being treated with a transfusion or medication. Before performing a surgical procedure, {{it is necessary to}} identify <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> histories, medication status, and detailed history of any bleeding tendency. Postoperative bleeding after oral surgery occurs in 8.6 – 32.1 % of patients with compromised hemostasis [5].|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> Leave <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Act, {{there are many}} other federal and state statutes that allow employees legal time off from work. Massachusetts enacted the Small Necessities Leave Act in 1998 which expanded upon the rights guaranteed by the FMLA.|$|R
3000|$|These results, while preliminary, {{suggest that}} the scores of the three subscales seem {{appropriate}} to the measurement model, corroborating the theoretical model of the original instrument (McCubbin 1987). In general, little variability in scores was observed, {{and in the case}} of some items, no participant gave the lowest score (i.e., 0). This can also be checked in Table  3, where, for <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> scales, <b>the</b> person separation index is below 2, indicating that only one distinguishable stratum can be found in the sample. This indicates that items that are more difficult are needed in order to differentiate participants more precisely. The person reliability indexes (both bellow [...]. 65) also corroborate these findings.|$|R
25|$|Some {{new mothers}} (and fathers) in the US will take unpaid time off, allowed by <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act. The FMLA entitles {{eligible}} employees of covered employers to take unpaid, job-protected leave for specified {{family and medical}} reasons with continuation of group health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} opinion in Chittister v. Department of Community & Economic Development, 226 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2000). This case concerned an employee's claim of wrongful termination under <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act {{against the state}} of Pennsylvania. States are free to maintain sovereign immunity under the U.S. Constitution. Since Pennsylvania had maintained its immunity to such suits, Alito affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the employee’s claims.|$|E
25|$|Altmire gained {{national}} attention with {{his effort to}} guarantee enlistment bonuses of combat-wounded veterans and was the principal author {{of the law that}} expands <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act to cover military guard and reserve families. He also personally intervened with President George W. Bush's administration and successfully forced a 2007 policy change allowing Vietnam-era Gold Star families access to White House tours after a constituent was denied.|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{counseling}} is “the {{process of}} helping people understand and {{adapt to the}} <b>medical,</b> psychological, <b>and</b> familial implications of genetic contributions to disease. ” Traditionally, this process includes collecting <b>and</b> inter-preting <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> history, risk assessment, a comprehensive educational process for potential genetic testing, informed consent, and psychosocial assessment and support (National Society of Genetic Counselors’ Definition Task Force et al. 2006). While genetic counsel-ing falls {{within the scope of}} many health care profession-als, clinical geneticists (physicians) and masters level genetic counselors have been working in the United States for more than 40 years, providing genetic counseling primarily for single-gene conditions.

40|$|A family conference (FC) is an {{opportunity}} for <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> their physician to share their knowledge and concerns about the physical and psychosocial dimensions of care. Appropriate communication principles and practice are both important for an effective FC. The FCs guided by common sense principles and sound clinical practice (good structure, content, and process) have beneficial outcomes. (1) Creation of a therapeutic partnership so <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> team collaborate in the difficult task of sophisticated <b>medical</b> <b>and</b> psychosocial care of a complex illness. (2) Enhanced therapeutic management through education and support of the patient and primary caregiver (<b>and</b> other <b>family</b> members) to facilitate self-efficacy and convey realistic hope with careful sequencing of key messages. (3) Easier patient transitions from cure- to care-oriented management, with a formal (yet thoughtful and gentle) introduction to the principles and practice of modern palliative medicine...|$|R
25|$|Some of {{the goals}} and {{institutions}} that Clinton advocates for in the book include: <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act of 1993, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, Community Policing, the Brady Bill, Amber Alerts, immunizations, State Children's Health Insurance Program, financial regulation, expanded Child Tax Credits, Minimum Wage increases, Universal health care, personal responsibility, uniforms in schools, Goals 2000 academic framework, music warning labels, sexual abstinence, Plan B contraception, family planning, and marriage.|$|E
25|$|If {{government}} support for workplace family-friendly policies or childcare subsidies was stronger, more solutions could be attempted. For example, child care subsidies {{by the government}} actually result in less childcare and work disruptions and could impact low-income families as well by making childcare more affordable. However, {{government support}} is not {{at the level of}} other developed countries. Legislation such as <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act had little impact on gender inequality in care work and was strongly opposed by businesses.|$|E

We presented <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> history of <b>the</b> child complaints, orthopedic/local status, and the results of radiological methods and emphasized difficulties of nosologic identification and differential diagnosis of the bone destructive process at the stage before biopsy and surgery. Macroscopic findings during surgery were identified, and the amount of resection of the affected bone was determined. A detailed description of the results of pathological and morphological (macro- and microscopic) studies is given, which could confirm the tumor process.

5000|$|Information about {{different}} types of leave, including holidays, paid time off (PTO), sick time, personal leave, military leave, bereavement, and voting leave. If the employer is covered by <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act of 1993 - generally 50 or more employees - a handbook usually contains information about FMLA and often includes specific policies for parental <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> leave.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act of 1993 {{requires}} {{employers to}} provide job-protected unpaid leave for certain {{family and medical}} reasons. Legitimate reasons include pregnancy, childbirth, adoption, foster care placement, and care for an ill family member. However, this legislation is limited: coverage is only extended for twelve weeks and for employees who have worked for at least twelve months at the same job. Short-term medical illness and routine medical checkups were not covered until the FMLA, and family members other than parents, spouses, and children are not covered. Some states have extended the definition of family on their own, and therefore extended the coverage of FMLA.|$|E
500|$|The Baird {{nomination}} was emblematic of other difficulties Clinton had {{during the transition}} period and his early days in office, including most prominently the dropping of a promised middle-class tax cut and resistance to his proposal to allow gays in the military. [...] Stephanopoulos later wrote that [...] "We should have never let the Baird nomination get {{as far as it}} did, but our systems failed us at every crucial step." [...] And the timing of the announcement of the Wood withdrawal detracted attention from the signing of <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Leave</b> Act of 1993, the first legislative achievement of the Clinton administration. While a Gallup Poll showed that only 22percent of the public said that Clinton's difficulties in naming someone for Attorney General decreased their confidence in his ability to lead the country, overall, Clinton experienced the highest disapproval ratings at the start of any presidency since such polling began. [...] His [...] "presidential honeymoon" [...] period was thus extremely brief.|$|E
