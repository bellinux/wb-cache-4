5|$|Woodlea is {{constructed}} of buff-colored pressed Italian brick with pale limestone trim. It is three stories tall, seven bays wide, {{and more than}} fourteen bays deep. The south and west facades are both symmetrical, although the house has an asymmetrical overall plan. The house has pedimented pavilions and entrance porticos on the west, south, and east; window trim consisting of stone surrounds, pediments, lintels, and sills; classical balusters and quoins. The house's third story is separated visually by a stone string course and is topped with a modillioned cornice. From a shallow hipped roof rise brick chimneys that are <b>trimmed</b> <b>and</b> capped with stone. The pavilion pediments have decorative urn-shaped elements. The house's windows are primarily rectangular, double hung, one-over-one panel style, except for a large triple Palladian window, which has stained glass and is situated midway up the house's main staircase, illuminating its lower steps. The house has distinctive quoins, pediments, and classical balustrades of pale gray limestone.|$|E

25|$|Obstructed airways – The {{restoration}} of normal breathing by correcting nasal obstruction {{caused by a}} cosmetic rhinoplasty wherein nasal cartilages were over-aggressively <b>trimmed,</b> <b>and</b> the nose appears pinched, which compromises nasal potency (airflow), especially when the patient attempts deep inspiration. These grafting techniques restore normal breathing by increasing {{the size of the}} nose tip with baton grafts (internal cartilage), and spreader grafts to widen the nasal middle vault. Furthermore, to improve breathing a septoplasty can be performed concurrent to the reconstructive surgery; likewise, if there is turbinate hypertrophy, an inferior turbinectomy can be performed.|$|E

40|$|The <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> fill method allows {{estimation}} of an adjusted meta-analysis estimate {{in the presence}} of publication bias. To date, the performance of the <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> fill method has had little assessment. In this paper, we provide a more comprehensive examination of different versions of the <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> fill method in a number of simulated meta-analysis scenarios, comparing results with those from usual unadjusted meta-analysis models and two simple alternatives, namely use of the estimate from: (i) the largest; or (ii) the most precise study in the meta-analysis. Findings suggest a great deal of variability in the performance of the different approaches. When there is large between-study heterogeneity the <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> fill method can underestimate the true positive effect when there is no publication bias. However, when publication bias is present the <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> fill method can give estimates that are less biased than the usual meta-analysis models. Although results suggest that the use of the estimate from the largest or most precise study seems a reasonable approach {{in the presence of}} publication bias, when between-study heterogeneity exists our simulations show that these estimates are quite biased. We conclude that in the presence of publication bias use of the <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> fill method can help to reduce the bias in pooled estimates, even though the performance of this method is not ideal. However, because we do not know whether funnel plot asymmetry is truly caused by publication bias, and because there is great variability in the performance of different <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> fill estimators and models in various meta-analysis scenarios, we recommend use of the <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> fill method as a form of sensitivity analysis as intended by the authors of the method. 2009...|$|R

25|$|According to {{the local}} records, eight stones were lost before {{the close of the}} 19th century, {{including}} Meigle 10. Some of the surviving stones are parts of larger monuments and it is probable that other fragments are buried in Meigle churchyard or have been used in the construction of walls. Before being moved into the museum, Meigle 1 and Meigle 2 stood {{on either side of the}} northern entrance to the churchyard, in front of a grass-covered mound called Vanora's Grave. Some of the stones appear to have been <b>trimmed</b> <b>and</b> placed near the Grave in the 16th and 17th centuries in order to decorate it.|$|E
25|$|The {{two figures}} are very richly dressed; despite the season both their outer garments, his tabard and her dress, are <b>trimmed</b> <b>and</b> fully lined with fur. The furs {{may be the}} {{especially}} expensive sable for him and ermine or miniver for her. He wears a hat of plaited straw dyed black, as often worn in the summer at the time. His tabard was more purple than it appears now (as the pigments have faded over time) and may be intended to be silk velvet (another very expensive item). Underneath he wears a doublet of patterned material, probably silk damask. Her dress has elaborate dagging (cloth folded and sewn together, then cut and frayed decoratively) on the sleeves, and a long train. Her blue underdress is also trimmed with white fur.|$|E
25|$|In regiments of {{infantry}} of the British Army and {{the armies}} of other Commonwealth countries, each battalion carries two colours, which collectively are called a stand. These are large flags, usually 36 in × 45 in, and mounted on a pike which is 8ft 7½ in long; the King's/Queen's Colour is usually {{a version of the}} country's national flag, often trimmed with gold fabric, and with the regiment's insignia placed in the centre. The Regimental Colour is a flag of a single colour, usually the colour of the uniform facings (collar/lapels and cuffs) of the regiment, again often <b>trimmed</b> <b>and</b> with the insignia in the centre. Most regiments that are designated as 'royal' regiments (that is either have the word 'Royal' or the sponsorship of a royal personage in their name) have a navy blue Regimental Colour. Irish regiments, today the Royal Irish Regiment, have a dark green Regimental Colour.|$|E

The timber used was [...] thick and nine laminations were required at the centre, where the stock passes through the poll end of the windshaft. Careful attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber. Both stocks were made during the work-in, with one of them being <b>trimmed</b> <b>and</b> finished ready for use. The stocks were the first laminated stocks made by amateurs.|$|E

Miller dived and balanced himself on his spine before catching the ball to leave England at 4/46.

500|$|In {{order to}} dive, the diving tanks, located above the waterline, {{had to be}} flooded by pumps, which took over 14½ minutes in early tests, but which was later reduced to 8 minutes.
