In this research, a heavy duty disk plow or disk harrow was used as a rotating knife to cut the sugarcane stubble. The parabolic disk was chosen because it is proven reliable as soil working tools and it is available in the market as spare part of disk plow or disk harrow unit. The prototype was mounted on the four wheel tractor 2 ̆ 7 s three point hitch, and powered by PTO of the tractor. Two kinds of disks were used in these experiments, those were disk with regular edge or plain disk and disk with scalloped edge or scalloped disk. Both disks had diameter of 28 inch. Results of field test showed that powered disk mechanism could satisfy cut sugar cane 2 ̆ 7 s stubble. However, scalloped disk type gave smoother stubble cuts compared to that of plain disk. Plain disk type gave broken stubble cut. Higher rotation (1000 rpm) resulted better cuts as compared to lower rotation (500 rpm) both either on plain disk and scalloped disk.

40|$|The {{prediction}} of chatter vibrations between the cutter and workpiece is {{important as a}} guidance to the machine tool user for an optimal selection of depth of cut and spindle rotation, resulting in maximum chip removal rate without this undesirable vibration. This {{can be done by}} some approaches. In this work, an analytical method is applied in which the time-varying directional dynamic milling forces coefficients are expanded in Fourier series and integrated in <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> bound by entry and exit angles. The forces in the contact zone between cutter and workpiece during the cut are evaluated by an algorithm using a mathematical model derived from several experimental tests with a dynamometer located between the workpiece and machine table.

The modal parameters of the machine-workpiece-tool system like natural frequencies, damping and residues must also be identified experimentally. At this point, it is possible to plot the stability lobes to this dynamic system. These curves relates the spindle speed with axial depth of cut, separating stable and unstable areas, allowing the selection of cutting parameters resulting maximum productivity, with acceptable surface roughness and absence of chatter vibrations. Experimental face milling tests were performed in a knee-type machine, using a five inserts cutter. The results showed perfect agreement between chatter prediction and experimental tests...|$|E

40|$|Excessive noise {{generation}} often occurs during the face-milling of thin-walled aluminum workpieces. It {{has been suggested}} that such noise can be reduced by utilizing milling cutters which employ non-uniform insert pitch. This report presents the results of a test series undertaken to determine the noise reduction potential of four different non-uniform insert pitch cutters used to machine the engine mounting face of an aluminum transmission housing. The tests were performed using the actual high volume, transfer-line machinery. It is shown that the use of non-uniform insert pitch does not necessarily reduce overall {{noise generation}}. There is, however, often a reduction in noisiness. To better understand the structural response of the workpiece a complete modal analysis is performed. In addition, noise frequency response functions are generated and are shown to form a basis on which to predict the noise radiation characteristics of the workpiece. A hybrid digital-analog computing system is developed and then used to simulate the workpiece response and to demonstrate the influence of various parameters such as forcing function definition, natural frequency, damping, and width of cut on system response. A more realistic forcing function definition, than the often used force impulse model, is developed. It is subsequently shown that significant differences in workpiece response occur for excitations based on these two models. It is also demonstrated that variation in width of cut has a significant influence on the forcing function definition. Several techniques for improving 2 ̆ 2 quiet cutter 2 ̆ 2 design strategies are illustrated. In particular, a technique of sectoring the workface into sections with constant 2 ̆ 2 effective 2 ̆ 2 width of cut is described. Such an approach permits <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> variation to be accounted for in a relatively simple manner. It is also shown that noise frequency response functions, when used in conjunction with a realistic model of insert engagement forces, allow prediction of workpiece noise emission characteristics as a function of cutter location.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to propose active damping as a {{potential}} control strategy for chatter instability in machine tools. The regenerative process theory explains chatter as a closed loop interaction between the structural dynamics and the cutting process. This {{is considered to be}} the most dominant reason behind machine tool chatter although other instability causing mechanisms exist. The stability lobe diagram provides a quantitative idea of the limits of stable machining in terms of two physical parameters: the width of contact between tool and the workpiece, called <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> and the speed of rotation of the spindle. It is found that the minimum value of the stability limit is proportional to the structural damping ratio for turning operations. This important finding provides the motivation of influencing the structural dynamics by active damping to enhance stability limits of a machining operation. A direct implementation of active damping in an industrial environment may be difficult. So an intermediate step of testing the strategy in a laboratory setup, without conducting real cutting is proposed. Two mechatronic "Hardware in the Loop" simulators for chatter in turning and milling are presented, which simulate regenerative chatter experimentally without conducting real cutting tests. A simple cantilever beam, representing the MDOF dynamics of the machine tool structure constitutes the basic hardware part and the cutting process is simulated in real time on a DSP board. The values of the cutting parameters such as spindle speed and the axial width of cut can be changed on the DSP board and the closed loop interaction between the structure and the cutting process can be led to instability. The demonstrators are then used as test beds to investigate the efficiency of active damping, as a potential chatter stabilization strategy. Active damping is easy to implement, robust and does not require a very detailed model of the structure for proper functioning, provided a collocated sensor and actuator configuration is followed. The idea of active damping is currently being implemented in the industry in various metal cutting machines as part of the European Union funded SMARTOOL project (www. smartool. org), intended to propose smart chatter control technologies in machining operations.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} some cutting {{variables}} {{on the quality of}} the surface produced during abrasive water jet machining of aluminum has been investigated. The type of abrasive used was garnet of mesh size 80. The machining was done on the abrasive water jet machine WJ 4080. The cutting variables were stand-off distance of the nozzle from the work surface, work feed rate and jet pressure. The evaluating criteria of the surface produced were width of cut, taper of the cut slot and work surface roughness. It was found experimentally that in order to minimize the width of cut; the nozzle should be placed close to the work surface. Increase in jet pressure results in widening of the cut slot both at the top and the at exit of the jet from the work. However, <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> at the bottom (exit) was always found to be larger than that at the top (at a stand-off distance of 3 mm and the work feed rate of 15 mm min- 1). It was found that the taper of cut gradually reduces with increase in stand-off distance and was close to zero at the stand-off distance of 4 mm (at a jet pressure of 30 ksi and a work feed rate of 15 mm min- 1). The feed rate of the work should be kept within 40 mm min- 1 (at the jet pressure of 30 ksi and the stand-off distance of 3 mm), because a feed rate beyond 40 mm min- 1 results in sharp increase in taper angle. The jet pressure does not show significant influence on the taper angle within the range of work feed and the stand-off distance considered. Both stand-off distance and the work feed rate show strong influence on the roughness of the machined surface. It was concluded that stand-off distance should be kept within 3 mm (at a jet pressure of 30 ksi and a work feed rate of 15 mm min- 1) and the work feed rate should be kept within 30 mm min- 1 (at a jet pressure of 30 ksi and a stand-off distance of 3 mm) in order to have a good surface finish, since beyond those values of the parameters the roughness of the machined surface rises sharply. Increase in jet pressure shows positive effect in terms of smoothness of the machined surface. With increase in jet pressure, the surface roughness decreases (at a stand-off distance of 3 mm and work feed of 15 mm min- 1). This is due to fragmentation of the abrasive particles into smaller sizes at a higher pressure and due to the fact that smaller particles produce smoother surface. It was also found that within the jet pressure considered, the work surface is smoother near the top surface and gradually it becomes rougher at higher depths...|$|E

40|$|Milling is a versatile, {{intermittent}} cutting {{process that is}} used in industry for creating {{many different types of}} components such as aerospace structures, mould and dies as well as thin walled workpieces. To understand the process better, a different contribution towards the variable flow stress machining theory for prediction of intermittent chip formation is presented. A proposed model is developed to extend the application of the variable flow stress machining theory to predict cutting forces in flat helical end milling. Non-uniform chip thickness geometry is yielded as the milling progresses. In applying the variable flow stress machining theory, the uncut chip geometry is portioned into a number of segments by discretizing the radial depth of cut. The chip geometry for each segment is considered to be constant by taking the average value of the maximum and minimum chip thickness. The maximum chip thickness for each chip segment is computed based on the current width of cut, feed per tooth and the cutter diameter. The subsequent radial depth of cut is subtracted from the discretized size of <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> to obtain the minimum chip thickness. The milling forces are summed for each infinitesimal segment to obtain the total forces acting on the system of the workpiece and the helical cutter. Oblique cutting conditions are applied to cater for the chip flow direction due to the helix angle. The flow stress of the material is represented by two material constitutive models, the Johnson-Cook constitutive equation and the empirical power law stress-strain relation which is used by Oxley and his co-workers. The models are used to represent the plastic deformation occurring at high strain, strain-rate and temperature in the primary deformation shear zone and tool-chip interface zone to obtain the forces generated during the process. A further model is developed to predict the dynamic chip thickness variation in end milling of thin-walled workpieces. The workpiece is modelled as a flexible cantilever plate and the cutter is assumed to be a rigid body. The specimen is discretised into a number of segments that may have a unique dynamic characteristic. The volume of the removed material is computed at each discrete axial depth of cut and undeformed chip thickness {{as well as at the}} given circumferential section of the tool for each tool step that is taken into account. The variation of the radial depth of cut due to the dynamic displacement of the workpiece is considered in this proposed model. At each time step, the changing workpiece geometry during the milling process is considered by updating the dynamic characteristics of the thin-walled workpiece. Experimental work has been carried out to investigate the characteristics of cutting forces for different cutting conditions with two different work materials and two different helical end mill geometries. The investigation also considers the significant impact of the wall characteristics such as the wall thickness, height and the milling configuration. The outcomes of the experimental investigation are discussed in detail and show the significant effects with the variation of the wall, giving an indication to understanding the machining process in order to build a capable dynamic model. The proposed models are validated by comparing the experimental results obtained with the predicted results. The comparison of the results is encouraging and reasonable correlation is achieved...|$|E
40|$|Human muscle-power {{alone can}} no longer feed Africa's growing population. Farmers will have to mechanize or food {{production}} will continue to fail {{to keep up with}} population growth. Mechanization does not mean simply the introduction of tractors (tractorization), it includes the improvement of all tools and equipment used in agriculture from clearing and cultivating the land to planting, harvesting and also transport, storage and processing. To be cost-effechve, mechanization must be appropriate to the varying conditions of different regions and even localities. It was to discuss appropriate mechanization in its many forms and options that representatives of 19 African countries (see end of report) met in Brussels, Belgium, 13 - 17 February 1990. Also present for this Euro-African Congress on Agricultural Mechanization were representatives of relevant organizations in several EC countries including Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. This Congress was a meeting of EC-ACP experts with complementary needs and experience. It was organised by the Belgian Federation of Agricultural and horticultural Equipment (UGEXPO) in collaboration with CTA, the Euro-African Association of Centres for Agricultural Mechanization (ACEMA) and the Belgian Agency for Development Cooperation, and {{with the support of the}} Commission of European Communities. Speakers at the opening, from Africa and Europe, stressed that in most of Africa cultivation is still largely by traditional methods and that these methods alone will not be able to meet the increasing demand for food in the immediate future. 'In most countries 70 - 80 % of our population remains in agriculture but food production is still insufficient', said Mr Abdel Rahman, Director of the African Regional Centre for Engineering Design and Manufacturing (ARCEDEM) which is based in Ibadan, Nigeria. The call for appropriate mechanization and the necessary training to operate and maintain equipment was taken up by the President of the Euro-African Association of Centres for Agricultural Mechanization (ACEMA), Mr Ela Evina. ACEMA is based in Yaounde, Cameroon. Mr Evina also raised the point that improved tools and equipment must not only be appropriate for the conditions they must be affordable. Financing mechanization Economic research has shown that farmers can afford to spend only about 15 % of their annual income (two months' production) on equipment purchase. No matter how good or desirable new machinery is, if it is too expensive it will not be purchased. Therefore mechanization presupposes a good market for produce since unless farmers can sell at a profit they will have no cash to mechanize. This point was made by Mr lan Johnson of Britain's Agricultural Food and Research Council Engineering (AFRC) and he went on to warn against assuming that mechanization (particularly tractorization) will necessarily increase yields. 'Most serious trials show that you cannot beat good hand cultivation', he said. He went on to suggest that post-emergence weeding was usually the most significant factor affecting yields and this is difficult to achieve with machines in mixed crops and almost impossible if machinery has to be hired. Timing of weeding operations is critical and Mr Johnson suggested that to help in cultivation, agricultural engineers should concentrate their efforts on improving the design of hand tools and animal draft equipment. A delegate from Zaire reported that trials with animal draft had not proved successful after two years and had been abandoned. This was considered too short a period by several delegates, who felt that trials must be continued for much longer,especially where there was little or no livestock tradition among the rural people. Mr Charles Mwanda, Director of Kenya's Agricultural Machinery Testing and Development Institute, Nakuru, said that he was very sad to hear of the Zaire experience and decision because he believed that animal traction gave farmers the chance to increase production, generate income and up-lift their standard of living before they attempted the next stage of cultivation, which was motorized mechanization. 'There's no way a farmer is going to jump from hand mechanization to the tractor unless he has the means, which is the money to do so', said Mr Mwanda. Improving animal traction To plough one hectare a farmer and his draft animals must walk nearly 50 kilometres and any improvement in design of tools and harness will improve efficiency of man and animals. Kenya, Tanzania and Zimbabwe have all concentrated on this sector and Zimbabwe has sent agricultural staff to Kenya to learn about improved harnesses. There is a shortage of draft animals in Zimbabwe due to competition for land and overgrazing in some areas. A farmer with only one draft animal has been considered draft-powerless, because with existing harnesses it was not possible to use one animal New harness technology brought back from Kenya has helped overcome this constraint and now single animals are being used in Zimbabwe for operations that do not require too much power. Kenya, said Mr Mwanda, had developed many of their ideas by modifying old European designs of harness and draft equipment. Local fibres and fabric are used in harnesses instead of European rope and canvas and European tools are made lighter to ease the load on draft animals faced with breaking up hard, dry soil. Where necessary, <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> on ploughs was reduced and cultivators made less wide. There were a lot of designs, now outdated in Europe, which could be adapted for Africa, concluded Mr Mwanda, adding that there was no point in re-inventing the wheel From Senegal, Mr Birame Fall pointed to the widespread and successful manufacture of simple equipment for light cultivation in workshops in many West African countries including Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d'lvoire, Mali, Senegal and Togo. However, lack of standardization has resulted in a proliferation of designs and specifications which makes production and procurement of spare parts a very serious problem. He suggested that ARCEDEM should coordinate the streamlining and standardization of designs. This would include minimum specifications for type' of steel to avoid the all too common experience of plough-shares made from unsuitable steel wearing out after only two or three hours of work, and equipment twisting under the slightest stress. For larger, more complicated machinery which carries high development costs, the potential market has to be wiser than or nation. It is here that regional cooperation through such associations as ARCEDEM and ACEMA is essential to achieve standardization. And standardization brings with it economies of scale. Too often in the past individual nations have developed their own design specifications resulting in too many machines being available for one job/ process, all requiring their own spare parts, in a market that is too small. Regional cooperation could lead to different countries specializing in different equipment. (This sounds utopian: the reality is more likely to be a desire on the part of each nation to be the one with the manufacturing base selling to all its neighbours.) Governments must agree on a realistic level of cross border tax levies since high taxes on spare parts will discourage proper maintenance. Tractorization has a role Tractors can cope easily with hard soil and their use results in timely cultivation and the infiltration of valuable rainfall. But there are four major limitations to their widespread use: high purchase cost, small farm sizes, inadequate skills in operation and maintenance, and lack of spare parts. Agricultural engineers have to realize that appropriate technology is not necessarily simple technology. A battery started engine that is incapable of hand staffing will soon cease to be useful if there is no readily available power source to recharge the battery. Spare parts must be easily and quickly available and stored efficiently. It has been found that up to 15 % of spare parts may be unusable through bad storage which has led to corrosion and other damage. Maintenance input must be kept low and simple or running costs can be ruinous. There have been calls for smaller, and therefore less expensive, tractors and even for two-wheel cultivators or power-tillers. However, while small tractors and single axle machines have proved successful in Asia where soils are frequently irrigated, they are usually inappropriate in Africa. It takes a full-sized tractor to cope with the often hard, dry conditions in Africa and, unfortunately, the bigger the tractor the better it does the work. One option for farmers with sufficient resources is to buy a tractor and to hire it out on a contract basis to his neighbours. This has proved very successful in Kenya but it is essential that land is cleared of all rocks and tree-stumps or the cost of breakages and punctures will easily exceed hire costs. Tractor-hire units run by the government have also been tried, with varying success. Now in Zimbabwe the government is running a pilot scheme to monitor the effectiveness of communal ownership of tractors. Nokazi Moyo is Engineer-in-charge of the Farm Machinery Mechanization Department of Zimbabwe's Institute of Agricultural Engineering and he admits to positive and negative results to-date. 'On the positive side we have proved without any reasonable doubt that it is possible to run profitably a tractor mechanization cooperative', he says. 'The negative side is the management input needed for all the records that have to be kept for work done, where the tractor is to go next and the servicing needed. This is above the heads of most of the people in our communal areas. They have to have the basic skills to read and write, basic maths and to have some management judgment to take decisions on priorities'. Also the time taken to carry out record keeping and to manage the efficient use of a tractor is time which small farmers cannot afford to sacrifice. The training of operators and maintenance engineers is another major challenge and many delegates to the Congress felt that tractor manufacturers should provide more training as a component of their sales service. Post-harvest mechanization Post-harvest mechanization can provide the best return on investment for farmers with limited funds. There was agreement on this between African and European experts, who felt that there was opportunity for a twofold increase in rural income through reducing post-harvest losses and by adding value to produce prior to its sale. 'Losses after harvest can range from 5 to 30 %', said Mr Haruna Musa, Director of the National Centre for Agricultural Mechanization (NCAM), Nigeria. 'If some engineering input could reduce these losses', he added, 'it would go a long way towards increasing productivity in the country'. Losses occur during transportation from the field to store; when crops are threshed or shelled; during storage; and when stores are emptied and produce is conveyed from store to transport vehicle. Better carts, threshing and shelling machines, and conveyors would help reduce this largely unnecessary wastage. 'Local processing can reduce transport cost, reduce wastage and increase the value of the crop, increasing the returns to the farmer, and at the same time bring work to the village', said Ian Johnson. Recognizing this, NCAM at Ilorin, Nigeria and Ghana's University of Science and Technology at Kumasi have developed or improved cassava and groundnut lifters, groundnut shellers, sugar cane crushers, gari making equipment and conveyors for grain and other produce. Cooperation is next step There was general agreement that there will be no progress towards successful agricultural mechanization unless policy- makers and governments in Africa give it priority. Ideally, national Agricultural Mechanization Committees should be set up to advise on national policies and to liaise through ACEMA with similar bodies in Africa and Europe. Meanwhile, European governments (possibly through the EC) could assist by helping to fund ACEMA and by encouraging European manufacturers to make available designs for equipment no longer in production. And both African and European partners in this endeavour must put much more emphasis on training and communication at all stages of the mechanization process. Opening the congress, Mr Robert Dellere Head of CTA's Technical Division, outlined CTA's role in communication between EC and ACP countries and this Congress, in which CTA collaborated, provided a much needed forum for exchange of views. In hi statement he said that a main conclusion a this Euro-African Congress on Agricultural Mechanization may be aptly summarized by the observation that while mechanization of agriculture is indispensable to Africa, and may benefit from European experience, it must be adapted for Africa and not modelled on Europe. The following African countries were represented: Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi Cameroon, Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Ghana Guinea Conakry, Kenya, Madagascar Malawi, Mali Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan Tanzania, Zaire, Zimbabwe.

Since microfabrication technology can make a since-depth indentation on a planar substrate, realizing the constant impedance structure was possible but a constant gradient structure was difficult; changing the group velocity along the structure while maintaining the gap and the depth of the indentation constant was difficult.

Also, 37 water jet cutting tests on Sardinian basalt samples were carried out based on the factorial design of the experiment at two levels and with the four operational parameters given above using Design Expert 7. 0. In addition to these cutting tests, control and repetition tests were also performed and in total, 72 cutting operations were made in this study. The two-factor interaction (2 FI) model was developed utilizing experimental measurements for <b>the</b> depth and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> after performing 37 cutting operations. The adequacy of the predicted regression model equations was tested using the very well-known method of analysis of variance.

These charts could be of help in the natural stone industry in terms of a more efficient usage of the water jet cutting machine. As a result of this study, the optimum values of working parameters for Sardinian basalt stone samples were found to be 0. 8 mm for the nozzle diameter, 90 MPa for the pressure, 5 mm for the standoff distance, and 4 m/min for the traverse velocity for the pure water jet cutting system.

This parameter depends on the driver style of drive {{and on the ground}} conditions (asphalt or ground, wet or dry). The front wheel speed and rear wheel speed are estimated, as reported in subsections 3.1 and 3.2, and their difference is used to calculate <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> on the electrical current of the spark plug. When the microcontroller receives an interrupt from the wheel speed sensors, it evaluates if the ignition spark cut must be done and the cut_off delay. When it receives the interrupt from the sparking signal that indicates that the ignition spark started, it eventually waits for a time equivalent to the cut_off delay and operates the ignition spark cut. The algorithm has been translated in assembly code and implemented in the Microchip PIC 18 F 6527 microcontroller with 40 [*]MHz clock, 10 [*]MHz bus clock, and 100 nanoseconds instruction time.
