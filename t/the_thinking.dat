5|$|The BJP's {{economic}} policy has changed considerably since its founding. There {{is a significant}} range of economic ideologies within the party.

It supported swadeshi (the promotion of indigenous industries and products) and a protectionist export policy. However, it supported internal economic liberalisation, and opposed the state-driven industrialisation favoured by the Congress.|$|E
5|$|With the {{pressure}} on the Diệm regime increasing during the Buddhist crisis, Nhu and Diệm began to shun their cabinet members because they presented arguments contrary to <b>the</b> <b>thinking</b> of the Ngô family.

Finding the situation increasingly intolerable, Thơ also considered resigning but the dissident generals urged him to remain. They were worried that mass resignations would arouse suspicion of a coup plot.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, <b>the</b> <b>thinking</b> on noise was dominated by the radio engineers' concern with external static. In modern terminology, this would include random (thermal and shot) noise but those concepts were relatively unknown and little understood at the time despite an early paper by Schottky in 1918 on shot noise. To the radio engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference. The line of attack against noise from the radio engineers included developing directional antennae and moving to higher frequencies where the problem was known not to be so severe.|$|E
40|$|A study {{presents}} a perceptual model of <b>thinking</b> called <b>the</b> "Six <b>Thinking</b> Hats " and argumentativeness {{as a predictor}} of response to the model. <b>The</b> "Six <b>Thinking</b> Hats " model creates six artificial contexts for <b>thinking,</b> corresponding to <b>the</b> primary thought modes of objective, subjective, critical, and creative thinking, within a comprehensive framework that allows the thinker to direct attention to <b>the</b> desired <b>thinking</b> mode. Argumentativeness is conceptualized as a generally stable trait which predisposes the individual in communication situations to advocate positions on controversial issues and to refute the positions which other people take on these issues. Subjects, 31 students at Rochester Institute of Technology in a graduate school management class, were trained to use <b>the</b> "Six <b>Thinking</b> Hats " model and completed survey instruments. Argumentativeness was not found to be a useful predictor of response to <b>the</b> "Six <b>Thinking</b> Hats " model for the individual thought modes, but broaches intriguing questions for future study within <b>the</b> fields of <b>thinking</b> and communication. (Contains 11 references and 3 notes. Appendixes present a detailed description of <b>the</b> introduction, training, <b>thinking</b> exercise, and surveys associated with <b>the</b> Six <b>Thinking</b> Hats model; and 2 tables of data.)

5|$|During Watts's lifetime, European culture {{had begun}} to {{question}} the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the time, based on <b>the</b> <b>thinking</b> of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, {{and the importance of}} material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless.|$|E
5|$|The term double burden {{arises from}} the fact that many women, as well as some men, are {{responsible}} for both domestic labor and paid labor. However, due to <b>the</b> <b>thinking</b> that a woman's time spent in domestic work is more valuable than a woman's time spent doing paid work, and that a man's time spent doing paid work is more valuable than a man's time spent doing domestic work, there is the issue of women having to do a large amount of both paid and unpaid work, leading to the double burden. Some alternative terms for double burden include : double day, second shift, and double duty.|$|E
5|$|Later studies {{investigated}} {{aspects of}} the effect. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg sought to explore how automatic the preference process was. They did this with both numbers and letters. They divided participants into two groups. The first group was asked to give quick, intuitive reactions stating preferences for the stimuli. The second group was asked to reason why they liked some numbers better than others and to analyse which features of the numbers they liked. As the researchers had predicted, they found that both the birthday-number effect and name-letter effect disappeared in the ‘thinking’ condition. They argued that thinking about reasons instigates deliberative overriding of implicit self-esteem effects. This conclusion was supported by looking at correlations between the effects: whereas in the feeling condition {{the strength of a}} participant's birthday-number effect was correlated to his or her name-letter effect, no such correlation was found in <b>the</b> <b>thinking</b> condition.|$|E

5|$|Sometime between 1902 and 1905, al-Qassam {{left for}} Cairo {{to study at}} the al-Azhar Mosque. Who he studied with is disputed by sources; some {{accounts}} say he studied under the Muslim reformist scholar Muhammad Abduh and {{came into contact with}} the prominent proto-Salafist, Rashid Rida, who himself studied under Abduh, while others are skeptical of al-Qassam's relationships with either. However, the attitude al-Qassam later adopted toward the political issues in the Arab world suggests he was well-acquainted with the ideas Abduh and Rida espoused. At al-Azhar, al-Qassam developed <b>the</b> <b>thinking</b> that would guide his future activism. Critical of a stagnant Islam, he preached among the ranks of farmers and other locals about the necessity for a modern Islam, one capable of defending itself from Western colonialism through jihad (holy struggle). He returned to Jableh in 1909 as an ′alim and worked as a teacher at a Qadariyya madrasa (Islamic school) where he taught both the mystical practices of the Qadariyya Sufi order and the jurisprudence and commentary of the Qur'an. In addition he preached as the imam of the Ibrahim Ibn Adham Mosque.|$|E

5|$|The House of Lords' {{statement}} on parliamentary privilege {{was assessed by}} the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which recommended that Parliament not counter the decision in Pepper v Hart, but cautioned that this should not lead to any further weakening of parliamentary privilege. However, academics widely condemned the decision and <b>the</b> <b>thinking</b> behind it. Academic Aileen Kavanagh questioned the logic used; the House of Lords was essentially saying that, where a minister has made a statement about an act's intent that was not questioned by Parliament, that statement {{can be used as}} evidence. However, there are many reasons why Members of Parliament might not question a statement, and this does not necessarily indicate that they approve of it; {{in the case of the}} Finance Act, for example, it could simply be that as the statement was not going to be added to the statute, they found no reason to actively oppose it. At the same time, different Members of Parliament may approve of a statutory provision for different reasons. The fact that a minister gives certain reasons for including a provision does not necessarily indicate that Parliament agrees; only that Parliament also feels, for whatever reason, that the provision should be included. The decision also raises questions about the separation of powers in the United Kingdom; it has been consistently maintained that it is Parliament, not the executive, which passes legislation. If one accepts that statements by the executive can allow them to specify the meaning of particular laws without formally including them in statutes where they can be approved by Parliament, it violates this separation of powers, allowing the executive to make law.|$|E

40|$|Introduction In studing the {{problems}} of <b>the</b> space <b>thinking</b> evolution we proceed from the premise: computer technologies determine the new principles of the formation {{and the evolution of}} <b>the</b> space <b>thinking</b> at <b>the</b> various levels of schooling.

The modern school must provide the level of <b>the</b> space <b>thinking</b> which would correspond to the natural aspiration of the student to the comprehensive intellegence. The considerable contribution to the evolution of <b>the</b> space <b>thinking</b> at school makes studing such subjects as physics, chemistry, geography, biology.
