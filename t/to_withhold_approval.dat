2500|$|When {{the details}} of this {{supposedly}} confidential agreement were leaked to the press, Caledonian, which had expressed its interest in acquiring BUA itself and had already begun negotiations with BUA's senior management to make an offer to take over the airline, immediately applied to the ATLB for the revocation of all of BUA's scheduled route licences, requesting them to be transferred to itself.

In particular, for drug research, there is insufficient provision in the current patient guidelines of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, since they make "no legal commitment" to paying compensation for injury to patient subjects.

II. POLICY All research staff must have completed an IACUC approved training program and be approved by the DAR Attending Veterinarian in order to provide care for or perform any procedures on NHPs at any OHSU facility. The Animal Welfare Act (9 CFR 1 (C) (2. 32) (a) and 2. 33 (a. 2) provides the WC or CWC Attending Veterinarians with the authority to approve or <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>approval</b> for projects until all training objectives are met satisfactorily.

The Jack H. Berryman Institute is dependent on Congressionally directed federal funding passed through USDA/ APHIS/Wildlife Services, but that was disrupted by the power shift that occurred in the U. S. Congress in January. The resolution of Congress <b>to</b> <b>withhold</b> <b>approval</b> of most spending bills until presentation of the fiscal 2008 budget later this year meant that the Berryman Institute’s fiscal 2007 budget did not get passed through to us. That crisis forced our 2 units (BI-West at Utah State University and BI-East at Mississippi State University) to effectively shut down until an interim plan could be made. Thankfully, we have strongly supportive colleagues in Wildlife Services who “passed around the hat” within their own agency and whittled from their own budgets to provide us with the baseline funding we need for the bare essentials, such as the {{publication of}} this issue. Our deep appreciation goes to Bill Clay and everyone else in Wildlife Services for their impressive display of support for the Jack H. Berryman Institute...|$|E
