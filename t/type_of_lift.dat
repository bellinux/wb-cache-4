50|$|The Carmila lift is a Tracey lift. It is {{configured}} in {{a similar}} way to a traverser type, comprising a horizontal beam supported by two posts. A pulley fitted to the horizontal beam is loosely held in place with a metal clamp and lengths of heavy wire. The rollers that form part of the lifting mechanism for this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> remain extant in the ground beneath the horizontal beam.|$|E
50|$|A shackle lift is {{designed}} to lift the vehicle {{in order to provide}} more room to fit larger tires. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> is accomplished by removing the stock shackles that the vehicle was equipped with and replacing them with longer ones. Lengthening the shackle moves one half of the leaf spring further away from the frame resulting in a taller suspension. Typically every two inches that a shackle is lengthened provides one inch of vehicle lift.|$|E

50|$|The Mount Martin cane lift is {{important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type. The lifts took two basic forms: a derrick with a swinging boom, and a horizontal beam supported by two upright posts. The lift at Mount Martin is a highly intact example of the derrick type and includes pulley wheels, cable, hook and access ladder. The ladder is a typical feature of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> and was fitted to permit access {{to the top of}} the derrick for maintenance purposes.|$|E
50|$|A block lift (often {{referred}} to as a budget lift) is a modification that is similar to a body lift in the way it works, but used in a different location. Block lifts are used to provide more room between the body and axle of a vehicle for larger tires. A block lift consists of either extended spring isolators or blocks that are inserted between a vehicles axle and spring, or a spring and the vehicles body. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> is often preferred due to the affordability and ease of installation.|$|E
50|$|The Leap cane lift is {{important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type. The lifts took two basic forms: a derrick with a swinging boom, and a horizontal beam supported by two upright posts. The lift at The Leap is a highly intact example of the latter type and includes pulley wheels, cable, hook and winch. Its location near a cane tramway reflects the predominate use of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> for loading tram wagons. The derrick type was used predominately for loading main line railway wagons.|$|E

5000|$|Workovers {{are often}} {{necessary}} in older wells, which may need smaller diameter tubing, scale or paraffin removal, acid matrix jobs, or completing new zones {{of interest in}} a shallower reservoir. Such remedial work can be performed using workover rigs - also known as pulling units, completion rigs or [...] "service rigs" [...] - to pull and replace tubing, or {{by the use of}} well intervention techniques utilizing coiled tubing. Depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> system and wellhead a rod rig or flushby can be used to change a pump without pulling the tubing.|$|E
50|$|The {{date of the}} image's {{finding is}} {{traditionally}} held to be 19 June 1763. Three fishermen, named Juan, Julián, and Diego dela Cruz, were fishing at a place known as Hulingduong, Binuangan in Obando, Bulacan. There, they caught the statue with their salambáw, which is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> net made from bamboo crosspieces and mounted on a raft. When the fishermen intended to bring the Virgin's image to neighbouring Navotas, their boat suddenly grew heavy and immobile. They decided to head for Obando, and their craft suddenly lightened and became easy to paddle. This they took to {{be a sign that}} the Virgin wanted to be enshrined in Obando.|$|E
50|$|Pair lifts {{are mostly}} overhead, rotational, and require ice coverage, i.e. to travel a {{distance}} across the ice. According {{to the current}} ISU rules for senior-level competition, the man must rotate more than once, but fewer than three-and-a-half times. Scores {{are affected by the}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift,</b> type of entry, ice coverage and speed across the ice, changes of position, the quality of the lady's position, the man's stability and cleanness of turns (i.e. minimal snow flying), type of dismount, and unique features. Optional features to increase one's score include performing a difficult entry or dismount, a release to one hand, changes of position during the lift, stopping the rotation, turning a carry lift into rotational one, or reversing rotation (i.e. both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions).|$|E

50|$|The HDB {{has begun}} to build more {{apartment}} buildings that are taller than 30 stories. For these buildings, existing elevator specifications such as speed, central system and hoist way equipment, {{will have to be}} improved for elevator manufacturers to design, supply and install higher speed and more sophisticated <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>lifts</b> in HDB estates to ensure better elevator ride, comfort and safety.|$|R
50|$|The two-handed lift was {{the first}} weightlifting event on 7 April. Six athletes took part. The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> used {{was similar to the}} modern clean and jerk. Viggo Jensen of Denmark and Launceston Elliot of the United Kingdom both lifted 111.5 kilograms, and the tie was broken by a {{determination}} by Prince George that Jensen had performed the lift with better form than had Elliot. A protest by the British delegation resulted in each athlete being given further attempts to improve their scores. Neither did, and the results stood as originally declared with Jensen taking the gold medal. Jensen had, however, suffered from the extra lifts in that he experienced a slight injury in trying to lift more than he was able.|$|E
5000|$|The lifts took {{different}} forms. F W Bolton, {{the manager}} of Farleigh Mill, is credited with introducing the [...] "traverser" [...] type by 1891. This consisted of an overhead travelling winch which traversed a horizontal beam supported by two posts. The cane was laid flat on a sling in a dray which was driven under the winch. The winch was used to hoist the bundle of cane which was traversed about two metres and lowered into a tramway wagon parked next to the dray. The lift was praised at the time for greatly reducing loading times and enabling the cane to be packed more densely. Apparently this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> was widely adopted {{but there are no}} known examples extant in the Mackay area.|$|E
50|$|Another type of gondola lift is the bi-cable gondola, {{which has}} one other {{stationary}} cable, besides the main haul rope, that helps support the cabins. One of the world's famous {{examples of this}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> include the Ngong Ping Cable Car in Hong Kong, the Singapore Cable Car, and the Sulphur Mountain Gondola in Banff, Canada. This system has the advantage that the stationary cable's strength and properties can be tailored to each span, which reduces costs. There are also tri-cable gondolas that have two stationary cables that support the cabins. They differ from cable cars in that the latter consist only {{of one or two}} usually larger cabins, moving up and down, not circulating. Bi and tri cable systems provide greater lateral stability allowing the system to operate in higher cross-winds.|$|E
50|$|Hackenschmidt was {{a pioneer}} in the field of weightlifting. He invented the {{exercise}} known as the hack squat, whose name is a reference to his own. Hackenschmidt also helped to popularize many other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>lifts</b> common within the modern training regimen, such as the bench press. During his career, he established numerous weightlifting records, which were improved upon by others in ensuing decades.|$|R
