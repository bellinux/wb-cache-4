5|$|Although {{the outward}} {{terminal}} {{of the line}} {{was to be the}} quay at Watchet, <b>the</b> <b>west</b> pier had been practically unusable for some considerable time, and boats were beached and loaded direct from carts brought on to the foreshore. After considerable public pressure, the Watchet Harbour Act was passed in 1857, placing it under the control of Commissioners; they built a new east pier and rebuilt <b>the</b> <b>west</b> pier; the work was finished in 1862, and 500ton vessels could enter the harbour. The WSMR used <b>the</b> <b>west</b> pier, and the newly arrived, broad gauge West Somerset Railway, a branch from the Bristol and Exeter Railway, used the east pier.|$|E

5|$|Both {{teams were}} evenly matched, with <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies not the force they had been, and England on the rise. The key players for <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies were Lara, Walsh and Bishop while England {{had a strong}} opening pair of Atherton and Graham Thorpe plus the young Dominic Cork who would be decisive in England's two Test {{victories}} in this series.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indian team {{had begun to}} decline. It was {{defeated}} by Australia in a 1994–95 series, the Third Test of which was played at the Queen's Park Oval, as {{were two of the}} ODI matches. The ground hosted two Tests of the 1997–98 tour by England, the second of which in February saw <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies defeated by England. <b>The</b> <b>West</b> Indian captain during the match, Brian Lara, went on to be the leading run scorer at the Queen's Park Oval in ODI matches, as well as hold record for the highest score made there. <b>The</b> <b>West</b> Indies lost heavily again to Australia at the ground in 1999, by a margin of 312 runs. This, the opening Test of the series, set the tone for a five-nil whitewash of the host team by the visiting Australians. The retirement of Ambrose and Courtney Walsh in 2001 further hampered West Indian efforts, and they were defeated at the Queen's Park Oval by South Africa in March, and India in August 2001. They were likewise defeated in ODI matches at the ground by both sides. <b>The</b> <b>West</b> Indies dropped to eighth in the Test rankings, with another heavy loss at the Queen's Park Oval against England in 2004, amid complaints {{about the quality of the}} pitch from England players. <b>The</b> <b>West</b> Indies also suffered at the hands of South Africa during ODI matches played at the ground.|$|E

England's morale was also surging following good performances in the shorter form of the game: the team had reached the World Cup Final the previous year, losing to Australia, and were expected to do well in One Day International cricket, even against <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies.|$|E
