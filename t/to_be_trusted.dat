5|$|Like the Shieldings’ lookout, {{one made}} {{guardian}} of the gateway to Lejre would have had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted,</b> and perhaps connected to the king by family or loyalty; the guardian would at least occupy an important position in the military hierarchy. Adornments like the Gevninge helmet fragment would have served to identify the rank of such a person, adding decoration to a helmet meant {{for more than just}} protection.|$|E
5|$|Although he has {{defeated}} the Lannisters three {{times on the}} battlefield, Robb knows that he cannot beat them alone. For this reason, he reluctantly agrees to send Theon Greyjoy to his father, Lord Balon Greyjoy, to convince Lord Greyjoy to join them with all the naval force of the Iron Islands. While his mother Catelyn wishes to return to Winterfell {{to be with her}} sons Bran and Rickon, Robb asks her to travel to Renly's court to negotiate an alliance. Catelyn tells Robb that his father would be proud of what Robb has accomplished, but warns him that Balon Greyjoy is not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted.</b>|$|E

5|$|Moore {{was known}} for his {{conservative}} political views. In the 1970s, he was chairman of the anti-immigration United Country Party, a position he held until the party was absorbed by the New Britain Party in 1980. He campaigned for the politician Edmund Iremonger at the 1979 general election, as they agreed the French and Germans were not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted.</b> Iremonger and Moore gave up political campaigning after deciding they were Thatcherites. Moore campaigned on behalf of Douglas Denny (UKIP) for the Chichester constituency in 2001. A Conservative voter for many years, he was a supporter and patron of the eurosceptic UK Independence Party until his death.|$|E
5|$|Oswald {{seems to}} have been on good terms with the West Saxons: he stood as sponsor to the baptism of their king, Cynegils, and married Cynegils' daughter. Her name is {{reported}} by only one source, Reginald of Durham's 12th century Vita S. Oswaldi, which says that it was Kyneburga. Although Oswald had one known son, Æthelwald, it is uncertain whether this was a son from his marriage to Cynegils' daughter or from an earlier relationshipsince Æthelwald began ruling in Deira in 651, {{it has been argued that}} a son from this marriage would have been too young at the time <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> with this position, and therefore may have been older, the product of a relationship Oswald had during his exile.|$|E
5|$|The {{appointment}} {{of the second}} and third Dukes of Norfolk as Lord High Treasurers from 1501 to 1546 led to a gradual reduction in the Exchequer's power. The Dukes were seen by the government as too independent <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> with any real power, but too useful to be removed; as a result, to indirectly reduce their power, the Exchequer was deliberately weakened. When William Paulet was appointed Treasurer in 1546 the Exchequer again increased in power, absorbing the Court of Augmentations and Court of First Fruits and Tenths by 1554. The Exchequer was also assisted in this period by Thomas Fanshawe, the Queen's Remembrancer; a capable man, Fanshawe was often consulted by the Barons of the Exchequer as to the best way to administer the court, and helped standardise pleadings, allowing the Exchequer to cope during a period of increased business. Fanshawe's administrative reforms were considered excellent, and his work continued to be used as the standard until the 1830s.|$|E

U.S. income and payroll taxes collected through deductions <b>are</b> considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trust</b> fund taxes, because the employer holds the deducted money in trust for later remittance.|$|R

500|$|It is a {{requirement}} that the subject matter be certain — that the property intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the <b>trust</b> <b>be</b> separated from other property, showing clarity in what <b>is</b> intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trust</b> property. If {{there is no clear}} separation, the trust will fail, as in Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd. This point was illustrated by Re London Wine Co (Shippers) Ltd, where creditors of a bankrupt wine trading company argued that they should <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> claim the wine they had paid for. The problem was that these bottles were not individually identifiable, and Oliver J held that: [...] A sum of money, say 10,000, does not satisfy the requirement, rendering uncertainty.|$|R
50|$|Effective {{communication}} {{depends on}} the informal understandings among the parties involved {{that are based on}} the trust developed between them. When <b>trust</b> exists, there <b>is</b> implicit understanding within communication, cultural differences may be overlooked, and problems can be dealt with more easily. The meaning of trust and how it is developed and communicated vary across societies. Similarly, some cultures have a greater propensity <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusting</b> than others.|$|R
500|$|A valid trust {{requires}} {{three certainties}} – certainty of intention (that the donor intends {{to make a}} trust) certainty of subject matter (that the property {{to make up the}} <b>trust</b> <b>is</b> identifiable) and certainty of object (that the beneficiaries are identifiable). The normal rule for certainty of subject matter is that the property intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the <b>trust</b> <b>be</b> separated from other property, showing clarity in what <b>is</b> intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trust</b> property. If there is no clear separation, the trust will fail.

25|$|The {{predominant}} {{theme in}} Notorious is trust—trust withheld, or given too freely. T. R. Devlin {{is a long}} time finding his trust, while Alexander Sebastian offers his up easily—and ultimately pays a big price for it. Likewise, the film addresses a woman's need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted,</b> and a man's need to open himself to love.|$|E
25|$|Cousin {{strongly}} {{insisted on}} the importance of method in philosophy. That which he adopts is the ordinary one of observation, analysis and induction. This observational method Cousin regards as that of the 18th century, the method which Descartes began and abandoned, and which Locke and Condillac applied, though imperfectly, and which Thomas Reid and Kant used with more success. He insists that this is the true method of philosophy as applied to consciousness, in which alone the facts of experience appear. But the proper condition of the application of the method is that it shall not, through prejudice of system, omit a single fact of consciousness. If the authority of consciousness is good in one instance, it is good in all. If not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> in one, it is not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> in any. Previous systems have erred in not presenting the facts of consciousness.|$|E
25|$|As stated above, {{trust in}} the trusted {{computing}} base is required to make any progress in ascertaining {{the security of the}} computer system. In other words, the trusted computing base is “trusted” first and foremost {{in the sense that it}} has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted,</b> and not necessarily that it is trustworthy. Real-world operating systems routinely have security-critical bugs discovered in them, which attests of the practical limits of such trust.|$|E

25|$|Sparta's {{interference}} and {{invasion of}} Thebes in 382 BC gave the latter {{a very good}} reason to join the league. However her behaviour within the league became difficult and Athens started to realise that Thebes was not necessarily <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted.</b> For example, Thebes destroyed Plataea in 372 BC, which had only recently been refounded. Athens started to think about negotiating peace with Sparta; it was while Athens was discussing this with Sparta that Thebes defeated the Spartan army conclusively at Battle of Leuctra (371 BC).|$|E
25|$|Later, ThunderClan becomes {{involved}} in a fight against RiverClan and ShadowClan, when RiverClan and ShadowClan unite and try to drive WindClan out again, and WindClan ally themselves with ThunderClan. When Fireheart is attacked by Leopardfur, the RiverClan deputy, Tigerclaw watches as Leopardfur and Fireheart fight, and does not attempt to help Fireheart. Silverstream attacks Fireheart but releases him; he then attacks her but, seeing Graystripe's look of dismay, and releases her. Darkstripe witnesses the event and reports it to Tigerclaw. Consequently, Fireheart becomes certain that Tigerclaw is not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 4 March 1796, Beaulieu was {{promoted}} to Feldzeugmeister and transferred to command the 32,000-strong Austrian army in northern Italy. He faced a French army with a newly created commander, Napoleon Bonaparte. Together with a 17,000-man army from the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, Beaulieu's task was to defend {{the crest of the}} Ligurian Alps and the northern Apennines {{in order to keep the}} French armies from entering the Po River basin of northern Italy. Secret orders from the Austrian government warned him that his Sardinian ally might soon change sides, and was not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted.</b> These instructions prevented Beaulieu from effectively cooperating with the Sardinian commander, Michelangelo Colli-Marchi, a personal friend.|$|E

But you can't very easily establish trust on a basis like that. If your basis is rational decision and your underlying motive is self-interest, then you can betray your trust at any point when it is profitable and in your interest to do so. Therefore other people can't trust you.

25|$|Wehrmacht officer Heinrich Gimpel astonishes his 10-year-old daughter, Alicia, with {{a secret}} that has been hidden from her all her life: the family is Jewish. He {{explains}} that the Gimpels, friends Walther and Esther Stutzman, and their extended families all belong to those remnants of Jews who now survive by hiding in plain sight within the very society that wants them dead. Now old enough, by family tradition, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> with this life-or-death deception, Alicia is obliged to hide the truth from her friends, her classmates, and even her younger sisters even as she is forced to regard her school's racist curriculum from a new perspective that leaves her sick and angry over all the anti-Semitic propaganda that she always learned and parroted without question.|$|E
25|$|In 1825 John Limbird was {{interested}} in founding a Mechanics' Newspaper with Robertson. The project was diverted by the intervention of John Gast's committee, becoming the Trades Newspaper of 1825 to 1827. Robertson was squared by being made editor, a decision unacceptable to Francis Place, who thought Robertson was not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted,</b> and wanted Edward Baines. In radical politics, Robertson and Hodgskin actually differed in their analysis. When Labour Defended, Hodgskin's landmark pamphlet, was reviewed in the Newspaper in 1825, {{there was a note}} of dissent from Robertson on fixed capital. This attitude diminished the ground on which Hodgskin was innovative. On the other hand, his ideas were quickly spread through the paper. Place attacked Robertson in consequence, in the Artizan.|$|E
