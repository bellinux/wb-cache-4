5|$|An {{independent}} study revealed <b>the</b> <b>water</b> to be radioactive {{and potentially dangerous}} to drink, initially surrounding the project with controversy. Jordan's Ministry of Water and Irrigation has stated that the radioactivity {{is not a problem}} because <b>the</b> <b>water</b> is to be diluted with an equal amount of water from other sources, although it remains disputed if this would be enough to bring <b>the</b> <b>water</b> up to standards. The Ministry said the {{independent study}} was inaccurate, as it did not test water from any of the wells that will be used in the project. The President of the Jordanian Geologists Association Bahjat Al Adwan stated that the radiation is present in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> in the form of Radon, and thus dissipates harmlessly when <b>the</b> <b>water</b> is exposed to air on the surface.|$|E
5|$|As the geyser fills, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> {{at the top}} of {{the column}} cools off, but because of the narrowness of the channel, {{convective}} cooling of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> in the reservoir is impossible.

5|$|Ocean {{surface waves}} are {{propagating}} oscillations {{caused by the}} drag and friction from air moving {{across the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> This friction transfers energy and forms surface waves in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> more or less {{in the direction of the}} wind. The top of a wave is known as its crest and its foot as its trough; the distance between two crests is the wavelength. These waves are mechanical: as they approach, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> at a given point rise up and, as they pass, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> goes down, with parcels of water tracing a roughly circular path. The energy is passed along with the wave at a much greater speed than the motion of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> itself.|$|E
