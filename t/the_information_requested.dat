The Commission did not provide <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>requested,</b> {{on the basis that}} the Commissioners had a right of privacy. The German newspaper Die Welt reported that the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, had spent a week on the yacht of the Greek shipping billionaire Spiros Latsis. It emerged soon afterwards that this had occurred a month before the Commission under Barroso's predecessor Romano Prodi approved 10.3 million euros of Greek state aid for Latsis's shipping company. It also became known that Peter Mandelson, then the British EU Commissioner, had accepted a trip to Jamaica from an unrevealed source.|$|E
25|$|From {{its early}} years, {{when it was}} contending that the Nairs needed to join {{together}} {{if they were to}} become a political force, it argued that the caste members should cease referring to their traditional subdivisions and instead see themselves as a whole. Census information thereafter appears to have become unreliable on the matter of the subdivisions, in part at least because of the NSS campaign to ensure that respondents did not provide <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>requested</b> of them. The NSS also promoted marriage across the various divisions in a further attempt to promote caste cohesion, although in this instance it met with only limited success. Indeed, even in the 1970s it was likely that cross-subdivision marriage was rare generally, and this was certainly the case in the Central Travancore area.|$|E

Chi-square tests for independence were performed to identify the relationships between the Classification (Patient Family, Hospital Staff) and two descriptors of <b>information</b> needs (<b>Request</b> Type, Resources Used). There were a total of 1, 406 <b>information</b> <b>requests</b> analyzed. <b>The</b> data showed that patient families and hospital staff <b>information</b> <b>requests</b> differed greatly in <b>the</b> number of <b>information</b> <b>requests,</b> <b>the</b> type of <b>information</b> <b>requested,</b> <b>the</b> resources used and the time the library staff spent on the requests.

25|$|From <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>requested</b> by his predecessor, {{and of all}} the {{scenarios}} that were examined by the Minister, he agreed in August 1968 to the closure of the Lewes to Uckfield section of line. But the resultant row over the severing of what was a very important rail link began. Considerable opposition from the users centred, in the first instance, around the inadequate replacement bus service – which had Ministerial approval. The issue was resolved by the Transport Commissioners who, on examination of all the complaints from the users and undertaking the journey themselves, upheld the users' complaints. However concerns over the state of the bridge over Cliffe High Street remained and finally the BR Chief Civil Engineer declared the bridge unsafe. This meant the cessation of rail services along this section of line, with a replacement bus service in place. All of these actions resulted in the delaying of the closure from January 1969 to May 1969.|$|E

In this experiment, ambiguity in <b>information</b> <b>requests</b> adversely affected accuracy and efficiency. Incongruities among <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>request,</b> <b>the</b> query syntax, and the data representation adversely affected accuracy, efficiency, and confidence. The results for ambiguity suggest that organizations might elicit better query development if end users were sensitized {{to the nature of}} ambiguities that could arise in their business contexts. End users could translate natural language queries into pseudo-SQL that could be examined for precision before the queries were developed. The results for incongruence suggest that better query development might ensue if semantic distances could be reduced by giving users data representations and database views that maximize construct congruence for the kinds of queries in typical domains.
