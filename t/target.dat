5|$|In {{computer}} science, binary search, {{also known}} as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds {{the position of a}} <b>target</b> value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the <b>target</b> value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the <b>target</b> cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the <b>target</b> is not in the array.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{software}} {{states are}} vulnerable to rowhammer attacks. An attacker thus needs to find right <b>target</b> states in order to utilize rowhammer errors. In practice, {{one of the main}} challenges is in identifying <b>target</b> states. Such typically have been done by domain experts. The mainstream fault tolerance community responded to rowhammer attacks with a systematic methodology which can be used to identify, validate, and evaluate rowhammer attack <b>target</b> states and their exploitability. That work is based on the well-established fault injection-based experimental methodology, and generalized attack <b>target</b> states and found a few practical <b>target</b> states that were previously unknown.|$|E

40|$|It {{is common}} in {{developing}} countries to attempt finer <b>targeting</b> of the benefits from social safety net programs through combining different <b>targeting</b> methods. We evaluate the returns to finer <b>targeting</b> {{in the context of}} the PROGRESA program in Mexico. This program is a prominent program in the literature reflecting the fact that it has been widely evaluated, is perceived to be well <b>targeted,</b> and has been used as a prototype for many other programs in the region and beyond. We also identify the relative incremental contribution of each <b>targeting</b> method to the overall <b>targeting</b> performance of the program. We find that geographic <b>targeting</b> dominates demographic <b>targeting</b> (based on linking transfer levels to demographic composition), which in turn dominates household proxy-means <b>targeting.</b> However, the contribution of proxy-means <b>targeting</b> increases substantially as the program expands into less marginal localities.

5|$|The TLAM {{could be}} {{equipped}} with an inertial and terrain contour matching (TERCOM) radar guidance package to find and destroy its <b>target.</b> The TERCOM radar used a stored map reference to compare with the actual terrain to determine the missile's position. If necessary, a course correction was then made to place the missile on course to the <b>target.</b> Terminal guidance in the <b>target</b> area {{was provided by the}} optical Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation (DSMAC) system, which compared a stored image of <b>target</b> with the actual <b>target</b> image.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept was}} for the {{satellite}} to be launched ahead of its <b>target,</b> so that the <b>target</b> would come close to it. After this the Agena would be used as fuel to put the SAINT in a co-orbit with its <b>target,</b> and then the SAINT would locate the <b>target</b> using its long range radar, and jettison its Agena once it had acquired the <b>target.</b> Then within the next 8 to 12 minutes the SAINT's radar and orientation systems would guide it to within 39ft (12m) of the <b>target.</b> If a SAINT was launched from Cape Canaveral, it {{would be able to}} provide initial video of the <b>target</b> and data dumps to the NORAD station in Rhodesia. A full inspection of the <b>target</b> would take two hours, and be recorded, then sent to a ground station as soon as it came within the range of the station. It would then stay within 200ft (60m) of the <b>target</b> for up to two days, taking pictures and measurements at different angles. After this it would be depleted of battery power and propellant.|$|E
5|$|While Seaborg {{applied for}} funding, Harvey {{worked on the}} {{einsteinium}} <b>target,</b> while Thomson and Choppin focused on methods for chemical isolation. Choppin suggested using α-hydroxyisobutyric acid to separate the mendelevium atoms {{from those of the}} lighter actinides. The actual synthesis was done by a recoil technique, introduced by Albert Ghiorso. In this technique, the einsteinium was placed {{on the opposite side of}} the <b>target</b> from the beam, so that the recoiling mendelevium atoms would get enough momentum to leave the <b>target</b> and be caught on a catcher foil made of gold. This recoil <b>target</b> was made by an electroplating technique, developed by Alfred Chetham-Strode. This technique gave a very high yield, which was absolutely necessary when working with such a rare and valuable product as the einsteinium <b>target</b> material. The recoil <b>target</b> consisted of 109 atoms of 253Es which were deposited electrolytically on a thin gold foil. It was bombarded by 41MeV alpha particles in the Berkeley cyclotron with a very high beam density of 6×1013 particles per second over an area of 0.05cm2. The <b>target</b> was cooled by water or liquid helium, and the foil could be replaced.|$|E

5|$|After launch, {{the missile}} was guided towards the <b>target</b> {{location}} {{as determined by}} the ship using a three-axis Attitude Reference Assembly (ATA) in an AN/DSQ-44 guidance section. The ATA was less accurate than a full-fledged inertial system, but good enough for Harpoon's range. For stabilization and control, the AGM-84A had four fixed cruciform wings (3x BSU-42/B, 1x BSU-43/B) and four movable BSU-44/B tail fins. The missile flew at a low cruise altitude and at a predetermined distance from the expected <b>target</b> position, its AN/DSQ-28 J-band active radar seeker in the nose was activated to acquire and lock on the <b>target.</b> The radar switch-on distance could be set to lower or higher values, the former requiring a more precisely-known <b>target</b> location but reducing the risk to be defeated by enemy Electronic Counter Measures (ECM).|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} disposal method, transmutation, {{has been}} demonstrated at CERN for technetium-99. In this process, the technetium (technetium-99 as a metal <b>target)</b> is bombarded with neutrons to form the short-lived technetium-100 (half-life = 16seconds) which decays by beta decay to ruthenium-100. If recovery of usable ruthenium is a goal, an extremely pure technetium <b>target</b> is needed; if small traces of the minor actinides such as americium and curium {{are present in the}} <b>target,</b> they are likely to undergo fission and form more fission products which increase the radioactivity of the irradiated <b>target.</b> The formation of ruthenium-106 (half-life 374days) from the 'fresh fission' is likely to increase the activity of the final ruthenium metal, which will then require a longer cooling time after irradiation before the ruthenium can be used.|$|E

In the latter, ambiguous N-terminal <b>targeting</b> signals have been described that result in the protein being located in both mitochondria and plastids.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a basic model for output fluctuations in traded and non-traded sectors under two alternative monetary policy regimes; exchange rate <b>targeting</b> (or monetary union) and inflation <b>targeting.</b> The conventional wisdom from one-sector models says that inflation <b>targeting</b> gives better output stabilization than exchange rate <b>targeting</b> when demand shocks occur, but the opposite when supply shocks occur. In a {{model with a}} traded and a non-traded sector, we show that the conventional wisdom holds for the non-traded sector. However, for the traded sector, we show that inflation <b>targeting</b> destabilizes output compared with exchange rate <b>targeting</b> when both supply and demand shocks occur. The only shocks where inflation <b>targeting</b> provides the better output stability for the traded sector are shocks to world market prices. The two-sector structure introduces new mechanisms that may turn around earlier results for aggregate production. For instance, a demand shock may induce higher aggregate output fluctuations with inflation <b>targeting</b> than with exchange rate <b>targeting.</b> Furthermore, a positive demand shock {{may prove to be}} contractionary under inflation <b>targeting.</b> Inflation <b>targeting,</b> exchange rate <b>targeting,</b> monetary policy, dependent economy model, output stability,...|$|R
