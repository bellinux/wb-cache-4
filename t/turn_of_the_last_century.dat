500|$|Meridian is rightly {{considered}} an architectural treasure trove being one the nations most intact cities from the <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>century.</b> [...] Architecture students {{from around the}} nation and Canada are known to visit Meridian in groups {{as part of their}} coursework due to numerous structures in the city having been designed by noted architects. [...] The only home in the US south designed by noted Canadian born architect Louis S. Curtiss, famous for inventing the glass curtain wall skyscraper, is extant on Highland Park. [...] The Frank Fort-designed Threefoot Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit's famed Fisher Building. [...] Noted California architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian {{as well as in the}} Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line. [...] He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean. His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his 2516 Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair, the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino. [...] One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s. [...] The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of post office built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had Lalique lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills.|$|E

[...] In 2006 they moved to the newly constructed University of Phoenix Stadium in suburban Glendale. Since moving to Phoenix, the Cardinals have made one championship appearance, Super Bowl XLIII on February 1, 2009, where they lost 27-23 to the Pittsburgh Steelers.|$|E
