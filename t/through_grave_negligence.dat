5000|$|Jesus {{used the}} idea of ransom, or {{redemption}} when referring to his work on earth ( [...] ; [...] ). Christ's death and resurrection (triumph over Satan and death) provide justification for believers before God.

According to Protestants this justification is by faith alone - not through good deeds - and is a gift from God through Christ. According to Catholics and Eastern Orthodox justification is a free gift but is received through baptism initially and through the sacrament of reconciliation if justification is lost <b>through</b> <b>grave</b> sin.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} few years in the United Kingdom (UK), casual viewers of the {{television}} and print media would find it extraordinarily difficult to avoid ruminations on the potentially ruinous state of the UK’s national debt crises. State borrowing, frequently positioned as part of an international response to prevent a global depression, has received considerable coverage, with an array of public figures sensing the opportunity to make political capital <b>through</b> <b>grave</b> judgements on the consequences of such financial profligacy. In the midst of this political manoeuvring there has been little public speculation on experiences of personal or consumer debt in the UK. However, the fact that personal debt has largely escaped the kind of media coverage that the national debt has incurred should not be taken as an indication of its non-problematic status. Currently, the average debt (including mortgages) owed by every UK adult is £ 30, 190 (about AUD$ 44, 108) (Creditaction, 2009). More importantly, personal debt in the UK continues to increas...|$|R

40|$|All {{over the}} western world, media are giving Muslims the role as scapegoats for {{everything}} that is wrong with society. <b>Through</b> <b>grave</b> generalizations as well as alleged connections between Islam and terrorism, social categorizations are established in which Muslims become the ‘others’. Research has been made on a various amount of western nations, {{with the exception of}} a few, and this thesis explores how Argentinean media portray Islam and Muslims. With the use of quantitative and qualitative text analyses, the result will show the levels of priming and framing in relation to earlier research. By assuming social constructivism, a high frequency of these two ‘faces of power’ would affect societal relations, possibly creating a gap between an ‘us’ and ‘them’. Our findings suggest, however, this is not the case in Argentina; on the contrary, Argentinean media lack the frames which make Muslims ‘others’. This important discovery implies that the relationship between Islam and the West of today does not necessarily have to be one of two combatants, incapable of coexisting...|$|R

40|$|Acquiring {{adequate}} {{resources for}} anatomy education has represented a challenge throughout the discipline's long history. A {{significant number of}} collections housed in anatomy departments contain human tissue of unknown provenance with some obtained in morally dubious ways. This paper outlines the history and future prospects of one such anatomical assemblage – the Burns Anatomical Collection, currently housed at the University of Maryland (UM). The collection originally contained more than 1000 anatomically prepared mummified human remains. They were produced by the renowned Scottish anatomist Allan Burns in Glasgow {{in the late eighteenth}} and early nineteenth centuries. The prepared cadavers became a commodity and after Burns' death, were acquired by his pupil Granville Pattison, who later sold them to the UM. While the origin of these human remains is unknown, historical data suggests that most of the cadavers for the collection were obtained <b>through</b> <b>grave</b> robbing. While intensely used in anatomy teaching in the nineteenth century, specimens from the collection should now be treated primarily as historical artifacts, appropriate only for teaching medical history and ethics. Other perspectives may include repatriating and reburying the human remains and providing a memorial service. Most importantly, this collection and others similar to it should initiate dialog and reflection on the ethical aspects of the past and present medical practice...|$|R
