5|$|It is in {{this period}} that the broch was built. Part of the {{structure}} has been lost to coastal erosion, and modern sea defences have been erected. The tower was probably originally 13metres (40feet) or more high and as with many broch sites the position would have commanded fine views of the surrounding seas. During this period archaeological sites in Shetland usually exhibit defensive fortifications of some kind, and Jarlshof is no exception. An outer defensive wall associated with the broch contained a substantial (although rather poorly constructed) house and byre at one time. This wall was utilised at a later stage to build a large roundhouse in <b>the</b> <b>lee</b> <b>of</b> the broch.|$|E
5|$|Keswick is in <b>the</b> <b>lee</b> <b>of</b> the Skiddaw group, {{the oldest}} group of {{rocks in the}} Lake District. These fells were formed during the Ordovician period, 488 to 443 million years ago; they form a {{triangle}} sheltering the town, reaching a maximum height of 931m on Skiddaw itself. To the west of Portinscale, to the south-west of the village of Thornthwaite, is Whinlatter Forest Park and Grisedale Pike. To the east, beyond Castlerigg stone circle, is St John's in the Vale, {{at the foot of}} the Helvellyn range, which is popular with ramblers starting from Keswick. In 2010, Electricity North West, United Utilities, the Lake District National Park Authority and the conservation charity Friends of the Lake District invested £100,000 to remove power lines and replace them with underground cables, to improve the quality of scenery in the vicinity.|$|E

5|$|Testing program staff {{originally}} {{set test}} Charlie for early 1947. They wanted to explode it deep {{under the surface}} in <b>the</b> <b>lee</b> <b>of</b> the atoll to test the effect of nuclear weapons as depth charges on unmoored ships. The unanticipated delays in decontaminating the target ships after test Baker prevented the required technical support personnel from assisting with Charlie and also meant {{that there were no}} uncontaminated target ships available for use in Charlie. The naval weapons program staff decided the test was less pressing given that the entire U.S. arsenal had only a handful of nuclear weapons and cancelled the test. The official reason given for cancelling Charlie was that the program staff felt it was unnecessary due {{to the success of the}} Able and Baker tests. The deep ocean effects testing that Charlie was to have performed were fulfilled nine years later with Operation Wigwam.|$|E
5|$|Half {{the area}} of the salt marshes that formed in <b>the</b> <b>lee</b> <b>of</b> Scolt Head Island has been {{reclaimed}} in the last 300 years, creating ecologically important, but very fragile, grazing marshes. Although Holkham is low-lying and can flood in severe weather conditions, it is protected by the spit that developed at the Holkham Gap in the 1990s and the dunes along the coast, which are increasingly being stabilised by vegetation. The Environment Agency's management plan until 2105 is to rely on the natural protection of the dunes, intervening only if work is necessary to maintain their effectiveness {{in the face of a}} potential sea level rise of 1.1m (3ft) by that date. The shingle that makes up Scolt Head Island is moving westwards and southwards at up to 3.5m (10ft) per year. This may affect the movement of sediment, and lead to some erosion of the dunes and beaches at Holkham, but should not destroy their effectiveness as a sea defence unless the island reattaches to the mainland at some date in the distant future.|$|E
5|$|The delay {{caused by}} the pursuit of Bompart by the frigates under George Countess allowed the British to {{dispatch}} a more substantial squadron under Warren to the Donegal coast. Thus when Bompart arrived in <b>the</b> <b>lee</b> <b>of</b> Tory Island, he soon found himself threatened on all sides by a superior British force. Despite the damage his ships had suffered in the heavy weather conditions, Bompart attempted to escape but was swiftly run down and defeated in battle, his flagship and four frigates being captured and towed into Lough Swilly. Among the prisoners seized on board the flagship was Theobald Wolfe Tone, leader of the United Irishmen, whose capture and subsequent death signified {{the end of the}} rebellion. Over the next week, the scattered French survivors desperately attempted to reach the safety of French harbours {{in the face of a}} dozens of British warships cruising along their homeward route. Only three made it, three others being hunted down and captured, one just a few miles from the entrance to Brest. The French never again attempted an invasion of Ireland.|$|E

25|$|Brazen {{sheltered}} in <b>the</b> <b>lee</b> <b>of</b> Grand Gosier Island, {{the southernmost}} of the Chandeleur Islands, and jettisoned her three masts and her quarterdeck and forecastle guns, but nevertheless dragged her three anchors {{to within a}} quarter of a mile from the beach. When the hurricane had passed, she salvaged the mainmast from the wreck of Warren and limped to the (then) Spanish port of Pensacola. The Spanish authorities allowed her to land some sailors to cut timber for the masts and throughout September the crew replaced the masts and carried out other repairs. On 29 September Brazen left Pensacola to resume her patrol off the mouth of the Mississippi. Stirling soon realised that the repairs had not made the ship completely seaworthy and decided to return her to Port Royal, where she arrived on 20 November. Further repairs were carried out in Jamaica, but the ship was recalled to England for a maintenance survey. She left on 19 December and arrived at Spithead on 9 February 1813, before sailing to Sheerness for the survey.|$|E
