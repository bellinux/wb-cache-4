5|$|Kirsten Klein (born 1945) studied {{portrait}} {{and museum}} photography before specializing in landscapes. Her black-and-white photographs often {{make use of}} older techniques such as cyanotype and platinum printing. Concentrating on landscapes, she conveys a sensitive, poetic and often melancholic mood. Since 1976, she has lived on the Danish island of Mors where she has photographed <b>the</b> <b>ever-changing</b> countryside and coastline.|$|E
5|$|The stacks {{belonged to}} Monet's farmer-neighbour, Monsieur Quéruel. Noticing {{the way the}} light changed on M. Quéruel's stacks, Monet asked his stepdaughter, Blanche Hoschedé, to bring him two canvases, one for sunny and one for {{overcast}} conditions. But Monet soon found he could not catch <b>the</b> <b>ever-changing</b> light and mood on merely two canvases: as a result, his willing helper was quickly bringing as many canvases as her wheelbarrow could hold. Monet's daily routine therefore came to involve carting paints, easels and many unfinished canvases back and forth, working on whichever canvas most closely resembled {{the scene of the}} moment as the conditions and light fluctuated. Although he began painting the stacks en plein air, Monet later revised his initial impressions in his studio, both to generate contrast and to preserve the harmony within the series.|$|E

30|$|The {{mobility}} and {{the heterogeneity of}} devices in SHs lead to <b>the</b> <b>ever-changes</b> of available services. It is infeasible to allocate services for user tasks in advance due to the changes of user location and that of available devices. Therefore, the service discovery, during which the services hosted on the available devices are discovered based on the unified device description, is necessitated. The service discovery is responsible for getting the accessible services in SHs. Furthermore, more contexts are captured to fully understand the environment and facilitate the ensuing service selection.|$|R

A global financial crisis was underway, and the casual dining segment of the industry was financially suffering.

40|$|Part 3 : StrategyInternational audienceTo fit <b>the</b> <b>ever-change</b> {{business}} context, developing {{large scale}} networked and collaborative strategies involve increasing both enterprise and information system agility and interoperability. At the same time, lean and six sigma theories {{have also been}} used in industries to improve the industrial process itself so that profitability, quality and reputation are increased. In order to achieve these goals, an efficient and comprehensive governance method is necessary. However, mostly existing governance methods are isolated, they do not allow a dynamic composition of monitoring services, and they lack of a converging Business Process Management and Service Oriented Architecture as a holistic ecosystem. To overcome these limits, this paper propose an agile governance method for multi-tier industrial architecture, this architecture can couple the IT service principles with the Lean- 6 sigma theories. This comprehensive governance architecture could eliminate monitoring blind spot lead to eliminate waste and defects...|$|R

25|$|The {{relationship}} between the Canadian Crown and the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples of Canada stretches {{back to the first}} interactions between European colonialists and North American indigenous people. Over centuries of interaction, treaties were established, and Canada's First Nations have, like the Māori and the Treaty of Waitangi in New Zealand, come to generally view these agreements as being between them and the Crown of Canada, and not <b>the</b> <b>ever-changing</b> governments.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} up-and-coming {{techniques}} to ensuring global food security {{is the use of}} genetically modified (GM) crops. The genome of these crops can be altered to address one or more aspects of the plant that may be preventing it from being grown in various regions under certain conditions.

25|$|Ultimately, the purpose, {{objective}} {{and meaning of}} healthcare philosophy is to consolidate the abundance of information regarding <b>the</b> <b>ever-changing</b> fields of biotechnology, medicine, and nursing. And seeing that healthcare typically {{ranks as one of}} the largest spending areas of governmental budgets, it becomes important to gain a greater understanding of healthcare as not only a social institution, but also as a political one. In addition, healthcare philosophy attempts to highlight the primary movers of healthcare systems; be it nurses, doctors, allied health professionals, hospital administrators, health insurance companies (HMOs and PPOs), the government (Medicare and Medicaid), and lastly, the patients themselves.|$|E

50|$|The {{shows were}} largely ad libbed, {{typically}} based around a one-page plot summary for each episode.

25|$|The {{association}} between the Canadian Crown and Indigenous peoples of Canada stretches {{back to the first}} decisions between North American Indigenous peoples and European colonialists and, over centuries of interface, treaties were established concerning the monarch and Indigenous tribes.

These agreements with the Crown are administered by Canadian Aboriginal law and overseen by the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs.|$|E
25|$|The {{light of}} Greece {{may be another}} {{important}} factor {{in the development of the}} particular character of ancient Greek architecture. The light is often extremely bright, with both the sky and the sea vividly blue. The clear light and sharp shadows give a precision to the details of landscape, pale rocky outcrops and seashore. This clarity is alternated with periods of haze that varies in colour to the light on it. In this characteristic environment, the ancient Greek architects constructed buildings that were marked by precision of detail. The gleaming marble surfaces were smooth, curved, fluted, or ornately sculpted to reflect the sun, cast graded shadows and change in colour with <b>the</b> <b>ever-changing</b> light of day.|$|E
