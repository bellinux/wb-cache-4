5|$|Another {{potential}} health problem is {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes {{the loss of the}} spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> limbs. Symptoms are normally seen within 3–4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and a shortened life span. A test is offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 a 700-year-old oak tree, {{called the}} Domesday Oak, was {{selected}} by The Tree Council as one of 50 Great British Trees. In 2011 a crack appeared in the <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> oak support beams were fitted to support the tree. The supports were only partly successful and {{a section of the}} tree collapsed; the remaining part of the tree was pruned to reduce the weight of the surviving section.|$|E
5|$|Local {{symptoms}} include immediate and intense pain, followed {{after a few}} minutes (but perhaps by as much as 30 minutes) by swelling and a tingling sensation. Blisters containing blood are not common. The pain may spread within a few hours, along with tenderness and inflammation. Reddish lymphangitic lines and bruising may appear, and the whole limb can become swollen and bruised within 24 hours. Swelling may also spread to the <b>trunk,</b> <b>and</b> with children, throughout the entire body. Necrosis and intracompartmental syndromes are very rare.|$|E

5|$|Over the centuries, {{the tree}} grows thicker and taller as {{successive}} rings develop around its <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> new buds grow on the branches. The tree {{becomes part of}} an old growth forest with a shaded and damp understory of broadleaf trees, shrubs, and ferns. In the canopy, a mat of dead needles and lichen accumulate on the wide upper branches. Exposed to light, air, and rain, the needles decompose and the mat becomes colonized by insects, fungus, and new plants.|$|E
5|$|The tree {{may also}} be {{attacked}} by the horse chestnut scale insect (Pulvinaria regalis) which sucks sap from the <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> branches, but does not cause serious damage to the tree. Sometimes squirrels will strip the bark off branches, girdling the stem; as a result whole branches may die, leaving brown, wilted leaves.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the <b>trunk,</b> <b>and</b> 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E

5|$|By the 1930s, Oslo had {{two main}} railway stations, Oslo East Station and Oslo West Station. The Drammen Line, {{consisting}} of commuter trains, and regional and intercity trains from the Sørland Line and the Vestfold Line, terminated at OsloV. The Østfold, <b>Trunk</b> <b>and</b> Gjøvik Lines terminated at OsloØ. Between the two stations ran the Oslo Port Line, which in part {{ran in the}} city streets and was only used for {{a limited number of}} freight trains. Several plans had been launched to connect the two stations, with the most prominent being a line running west of Oslo and merging with the Gjøvik Line at Grefsen, and an elevated line from OsloV to Tordensskiolds plass, in a tunnel under Akershus Fortress and again as an elevated line past Oslo Stock Exchange to OsloØ.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few days, the newborn is {{unsteady}} on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.|$|E
5|$|In botany, a tree is a {{perennial}} plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, {{the definition of}} a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. In looser definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.|$|E

5|$|JAL Express (JEX) was {{established}} on April 1, 1997, as a wholly owned domestic subsidiary airline of Japan Airlines (JAL), {{with an initial}} capital of ¥5.8 million. The airline operates scheduled passenger services to regional domestic destinations in Japan, {{as well as some}} low-demand flights for JAL under wet-lease agreement. It was anticipated that the airline may enter services on the domestic <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> short-haul international routes. On July 1, 1998, JAL Express commenced operations from Osaka to Miyazaki and Kagoshima with two Boeing 737-400s, non-Japanese cockpit crew, and short-term contracted cabin attendants. The airline's cabin attendants are called Sky Cast, their duties include cleaning the 150-seat cabin between flights.|$|E
5|$|Past {{experiences}} {{or general}} knowledge {{is often called}} upon in conversation, {{so it is a}} useful context for children to learn words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references. For example, if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but did not know the word elephant, an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size and color of the animal, how big its ears were, its <b>trunk,</b> <b>and</b> the sound it made, then using the word elephant to refer to the animal. Calling upon prior knowledge is used not only in conversation, but often in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating it back to the child's own experiences.|$|E
5|$|Smallpox virus {{preferentially}} attacks skin cells, {{causing the}} characteristic pimples (called macules) {{associated with the}} disease. A rash develops on the skin 24 to 48 hours after lesions on the mucous membranes appear. Typically the macules first appear on the forehead, then rapidly spread to the whole face, proximal portions of extremities, the <b>trunk,</b> <b>and</b> lastly to distal portions of extremities. The process takes no more than 24 to 36 hours, after which no new lesions appear. At this point variola major infection can take several very different courses, resulting in four types of smallpox disease based on the Rao classification: ordinary, modified, malignant (or flat), and hemorrhagic. Historically, smallpox has an overall fatality rate of about 30 percent; however, the malignant and hemorrhagic forms are usually fatal.|$|E

5|$|Suzuki was {{inspired}} to write a biography of a tree when he noticed a Douglas-fir with an uncharacteristic curve in its <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> speculated what caused it to grow into that shape. Suzuki studied the topic {{with the help of}} a research assistant and solicited Grady to help write the book. Vancouver publishers Greystone Books released the book in September 2004. In the Canadian market, it peaked at number three in the Maclean's and the National Post non-fiction best seller lists and was nominated for several awards. In February 2005 it was published in Australia by Allen & Unwin. The premise and writing were well received by critics. While several reviewers found that the authors succeeded in using accessible language, others found it too technical.|$|E
5|$|The {{back was}} also reconstructed {{in a more}} or less {{horizontal}} orientation by Borsuk-Białynicka, which was followed by most subsequent depictions. In a 2007 study, Daniela Schwarz and colleagues suggested that the back dipped towards the rear. According to these researchers, the shoulder blade would have been inclined at a horizontal angle of 55–65°, much steeper than previously thought, resulting in an elevated shoulder region. With the vertebral column of the <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> neck held in a relatively straight line, this would result in an elevated position of the head.|$|E
5|$|The common {{thresher}} is {{a fairly}} robust shark with a torpedo-shaped <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> a short, broad head. The dorsal profile of the head curves evenly down to the pointed, conical snout. The eyes are moderately large and lack nictitating membranes. The small mouth is arched and, unlike in other thresher sharks, has furrows at the corners. There are 32-53 upper and 25-50 lower tooth rows; the teeth are small, triangular, and smooth-edged, lacking lateral cusplets. The five pairs of gill slits are short, with {{the fourth and fifth}} pairs located over the pectoral fin bases.|$|E
5|$|At the 2008 ICF Congress in Rome, a {{new program}} for the championships was approved. This marked the first change in the program since the {{addition}} of the K-4 1000 m women's event at the 2001 championships in Poznań. Men's C-4 500 m, men's K-4 500 m, women's K-4 1000 m events were replaced by C-1 4 × 200 m relay (men only) and K-1 4 × 200 m relay (both men and women). Women's C-1 200 m, C-1 500 m, C-2 200 m and C-2 500 m events were shown as exhibition. Paddleability exhibition events of K-1 200 m LTA (men & women), K-2 200 m TA (mixed), and C-2 200 m LTA (mixed) also took place (LTATA – Legs, <b>Trunks,</b> <b>and</b> Arms or <b>Trunks</b> <b>and</b> Arms; LTA – Legs, <b>Trunks,</b> <b>and</b> Arms; <b>and</b> TA – <b>Trunks</b> <b>and</b> Arms, or Arms). Support for women's Canadian and the paddle ability events were confirmed at an ICF Board of Directors meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 18–20 March 2009. A training camp was held for women's canoe in conjunction with the championships.|$|R

5|$|The {{initial period}} {{following}} the contraction of HIV is called acute HIV, primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome. Many individuals develop an influenza-like illness or a mononucleosis-like illness 2–4 weeks post exposure {{while others have}} no significant symptoms. Symptoms occur in 40–90% of cases and most commonly include fever, large tender lymph nodes, throat inflammation, a rash, headache, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals. The rash, which occurs in 20–50% of cases, presents itself on the <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> is maculopapular, classically. Some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting or diarrhea may occur. Neurological symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or Guillain–Barré syndrome also occurs. The duration of the symptoms varies, but is usually one or two weeks.|$|E
5|$|The roots are, generally, an {{underground}} {{part of the}} tree, but some tree species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial roots may be of two kinds, {{to contribute to the}} mechanical stability of the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of mechanical stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that loop out of the <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> branches and descend vertically into the mud. A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan. Many large trees have buttress roots which flare out from {{the lower part of the}} trunk. These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the surface.|$|E
