5000|$|QTIP {{trust is}} a type of trust and an estate {{planning}} tool used in the United States. [...] "QTIP" [...] is short for [...] "Qualified <b>Terminable</b> <b>Interest</b> Property." [...] A QTIP trust is often used in order {{to take advantage of the}} marital deduction and still control the ultimate distribution of the assets at the death of the surviving spouse.|$|E
50|$|The current regime {{under the}} 1995 Act for {{regulating}} tenancies, {{commonly known as}} Farm Business Tenancies, permits {{the creation of a}} clearly and easily <b>terminable</b> <b>interest,</b> whether by a periodic tenancy or a fixed term. In the cycle of animal husbandry and land use and improvement, the long-term effect of the Farm Business Tenancy on the landscape of Britain is not yet proven. It was predicted by landowners and other industry spokesmen that the 1995 Act would create opportunities for new tenants by allowing large areas of new lettings but this has not happened in practice as most landowners have continued to favour share farming or management agreements over formal tenancies and the majority of new lettings under the Act have been to existing farmers, often owner-occupiers taking on extra land at significantly higher rents than could be afforded by a traditional tenant.|$|E
40|$|Because of {{the sunset}} {{provision}} of EGTRRA, estate planning through 2010 and beyond has {{become even more}} complicated. EGTRRA phases down the maximum estate, gift, and generation skipping rate of tax at intervals. Applicable state tax rates have in many states been modified to adjust for the EGTRRA effect. This article discusses the use of AB and Qualified <b>Terminable</b> <b>Interest</b> Property trusts using several hypothetical situations...|$|E
50|$|The {{taxable estate}} of a married decedent {{is reduced by}} a {{deduction}} for all property passing to the decedent's spouse. Certain <b>terminable</b> <b>interests</b> are included. Other conditions may apply.|$|R
40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} Qualified <b>Terminable</b> <b>Interest</b> Property (QTIP) Taxing Provisions and the QTIP Rulings. Part II {{explains}} that in doing so, {{it relies on}} the theory of legal fictions. This theory provides a conceptual tool by which to understand {{all aspects of the}} QTIP Provisions. Part III provides background for the analysis that follows by reviewing the marital deduction provisions, the <b>Terminable</b> <b>Interest</b> Rule, and the QTIP Provisions. Part IV demonstrates that the decision to grant the marital deduction for QTIP Property can be explained by means of a legal fiction that treats QTIP Property as passing in its entirety to the surviving spouse (2 ̆ 2 Ownership Fiction 2 ̆ 2). The Ownership Fiction ensures that the QTIP Property will ultimately be taxed in the surviving spouse 2 ̆ 7 s transfer tax base. This taxation is the topic of Parts V and VI, which address the QTIP Taxing Provisions and the QTIP Rulings, respectively. This Article concludes that the QTIP Taxing Provisions lead to equitable results when applied by their terms, but inequitable and inconsistent results when extended beyond their terms by the QTIP Rulings...|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} decision, the Tax Court {{concluded}} that an interest passing to a surviving spouse under a trust instrument qualified for a marital deduction where the interest was vested indefeasibly {{on the date}} of death but might have no value. The author suggests that the Internal Revenue Service attack upon this estate plan was based upon mistakenly equating <b>terminable</b> <b>interest</b> with terminable value-a confusion which has existed {{at least since the}} issuance of Revenue Procedure 64 - 19 in 1964...|$|E
40|$|In Morgens, {{the court}} {{ruled in favor of}} the {{government}} that section 2035 (b) applied to the gift taxes paid by the qualified <b>terminable</b> <b>interest</b> property (QTIP) trust beneficiaries to gross up the widow’s estate by that amount. Because the surviving (or donee) spouse must be taxed on the underlying property over which she has no ownership rights, Congress enacted section 2207 A to allow the second spouse to recover from the beneficiaries of the property the transfer taxes relating to her gift or estate inclusion. However, the court held that section 2207 A did not shift the gift tax liability to those beneficiaries to exempt the widow’s estate from the application of section 2035 (b) ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{proposes to}} repeal the QTIP {{provisions}} in order to collect revenue now for transfers that are essentially transfers to third parties {{and not to the}} decedent 2 ̆ 7 s spouse. Because there are advantages of increased flexibility attendant to a QTIP as opposed to a PAT, this article proposes to take those repealed QTIP benefits and attach them to the PAT, which would greatly enhance that marital deduction trust form. A super-charged PAT would thereby be able to preserve the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s GST tax exemption (like a reverse QTIP), create a decedent 2 ̆ 7 s by-pass trust by allowing a PAT (or a partial PAT) 2 ̆ 2 election-out, 2 ̆ 2 and create a decedent 2 ̆ 7 s state-only PAT marital deduction. The super-charged PAT would provide for much desired post-mortem tax planning without the complex and strict requirements of a disclaimer. Moreover, the new PAT would eliminate conflicts of interest and fiduciary problems inherent in the QTIP form of the marital deduction. Lastly, by repealing the QTIP provisions and by super-charging the PAT, the marital deduction would truly be a marital deduction and not a third party beneficiary tax deferral device. I have criticized the QTIP trust on the basis that the QTIP provisions are both illogical and sexist. The QTIP provisions are illogical because they conflict with their stated public policy goal of taxing marital property when it leaves the marital unit and passes to other beneficiaries. Because the goal of the marital deduction is to tax property when it leaves the marital unit and because the QTIP expressly endorses passing the property to third parties at the first spouse’s death, the QTIP undermines the fundamental rationale for the marital deduction. Likewise, the QTIP provisions are sexist. They treat women as the invisible spouse and they equate giving an income interest to women with giving them the corpus. With the QTIP, the first spouse to die controls the disposition of the corpus and he selects the decision maker who will make the QTIP election. The QTIP provisions implicitly equate giving an income interest to women with giving them the property itself because unlike the other exceptions to the <b>terminable</b> <b>interest</b> rule in which the widow is given a rough equivalent to outright ownership of the corpus, the QTIP provisions allow a marital deduction for the full value of the property at the husband 2 ̆ 7 s death even though the surviving spouse, {{the other half of the}} marital unit, receives only the income interest in that property. A PAT provides the surviving spouse with both an income interest and a power to appoint the property to herself or to her estate; it is considered an equivalent to ownership although this article recommends that the PAT require that the surviving spouse be entitled to both an inter vivos and a testamentary power of appointment over the trust property. The PAT, however, has all but disappeared as a marital transfer because of the popularity of the QTIP. This article proposes {{to repeal the}} QTIP provisions but recognizes that repeal is virtually impossible because of certain well-liked features of the QTIP that have nothing to do with the decedent’s desire for dead hand control, but which provide advantages of increased flexibility in estate planning. Therefore, this article proposes to take those repealed QTIP “flexibility” benefits and attach them to the PAT to create a “super-charged” PAT to take the place of the QTIP trust...|$|E
