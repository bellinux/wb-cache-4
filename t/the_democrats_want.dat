500|$|There {{were two}} main {{divisive}} issues in 1868. The {{first was the}} continued Reconstruction of <b>the</b> South. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> advocated allowing former Confederate soldiers to hold elective offices, and the Republicans endorsed the proposed Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution which allowed African Americans to vote. The other controversial issue concerned the redemption of war bonds either in gold or paper money known as greenbacks. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>wanted</b> to redeem <b>the</b> bonds with $100,000,000 in greenbacks and the rest with gold. The greenbacks were known as [...] "cheap money" [...] and would be inflationary. The Republicans wanted to pay the redemption of war bonds only with gold, a position attractive to investors and bankers.|$|R
50|$|After Democrats {{took control}} of state legislatures again after the Compromise of 1877, they began to work to {{restrict}} the ability of blacks to vote. Paramilitary {{groups such as the}} White League, Red Shirts, and rifle clubs had intimidated blacks or barred them from the polls in numerous elections before the Redemption. Nonetheless, a coalition of Populists and Republicans in fusion tickets in the 1880s and 1890s gained some seats and won some governor positions. To prevent such coalitions in <b>the</b> future, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>wanted</b> to exclude freedmen and other blacks from voting; in some states they also restricted poor whites to avoid biracial coalitions.|$|R
50|$|After New Mexico {{territory}} {{passed to}} American rule following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, {{the issue of}} slavery in the new territory became a major issue, with the Whigs wanting to keep Mexico's ban on slavery and <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>wanting</b> to introduce it. In the Compromise of 1850, {{it was decided that}} New Mexico Territory would be able to choose its own stance on slavery by popular sovereignty. In 1859, New Mexico passed the Act for the Protection of Slave Property. This was partially because Territorial Governor William Carr Lane and Chief Justice of the New Mexico Supreme Court Grafton Baker owned black slaves.|$|R

2500|$|The end of {{transportation}} and {{the rapid growth of}} population following the gold rush led to a demand for [...] "British institutions" [...] in New South Wales, which meant an elected parliament and responsible self-government. In 1851 the franchise for the Legislative Council was expanded, but this did not satisfy the settlers, many of whom (such as the young Henry Parkes) had been Chartists in Britain in the 1840s. Successive Governors warned the Colonial Office of the dangers of republicanism if the demands for self-government were not met. There was, however, a prolonged battle between the conservatives, now led by Wentworth, and <b>the</b> <b>democrats</b> as to what kind of constitution New South Wales would have. The key issue was control of the pastoral lands, which <b>the</b> <b>democrats</b> <b>wanted</b> to take away from the squatters and break up into farms for settlers. Wentworth wanted a hereditary upper house controlled by the squatters to prevent any such possibility. The radicals, led by rising politicians like Parkes and journalists like Daniel Deniehy, ridiculed suggestions of a [...] "bunyip aristocracy." ...|$|R
40|$|During the 1992 presidential election, {{both the}} Republican and Democratic Parties were {{reluctant}} to energetically pursue the black vote. Because on the one hand, even {{in the light of}} some African Americans contemplating abandoning <b>the</b> party, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>wanted</b> desperately to attract the vote of the so-called 2 ̆ 2 Reagan Democrats. 2 ̆ 2 On the other side, the Republican Party did not want to lose a grip on their own constituency. Therefore, neither party assertively sought the black vote, and consequently ignored the black voter in the 1992 Presidential election. Hence the purpose of this research is two-fold. First, after a thorough history of the relationship between blacks and political parties are examined, the paper will examine the apparent neglect of the African American voter during the 1992 presidential election. And second, in relation to the voter, the electoral strategies put forth by the Democratic and Republican parties, including the Ross Perot campaign, will be discussed...|$|R

Many incidents made a healthy coalition impossible. Prime minister Dries van Agt {{had lots of}} trouble with the vice-prime minister Joop den Uyl of the labour party. Den Uyl tried to create employment as minister of social affairs. Plans to reform the health insurance act was met with a huge resistance from the left-wing. The cabinet fell because <b>the</b> Christian <b>democrats</b> <b>wanted</b> a cut in government spending, while the labour party was much opposed to this.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} this policy {{cooperation}} was the budget proposal that the Alliance parties put forward on 2 October 2005.

2500|$|Early in his term, Bush {{faced the}} problem {{of what to do}} with {{leftover}} deficits spawned by the Reagan years. At $220billion in 1990, the deficit had grown to three times its size since 1980. This financial situation severely limited the President's ability to enact major domestic programs. The federal government did not have the revenues for any large, new domestic ventures, nor did the political climate lend itself to enacting them. To compensate for these constraints, Bush stressed [...] "a limited agenda," [...] that included volunteerism, education reform, and anti-drug efforts. Having pledged during the campaign not to raise taxes, the President found himself in the difficult position of trying to balance the budget and reduce the deficit without imposing additional taxes on the American people. He also faced a Congress controlled by <b>the</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Although Republicans thought that the government should approach the budget deficit by drastically cutting domestic spending, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>wanted</b> to raise taxes on the richest Americans. Budget negotiations for the 1991 fiscal year proved especially contentious and problematic. Bush had no choice but to compromise with Congress, and his administration entered into lengthy talks with congressional leaders. Bush issued a written statement to the press, reneging on his 1988 [...] "no new taxes" [...] campaign promise, noting that tax increases might be necessary to solve the deficit problem.|$|R

5000|$|It {{was almost}} three years before the matter was settled in court. These events led to the {{political}} maneuvering {{which led to the}} formation of Otero County.

[...] Lee's friend, Albert Fall and other Democrats offered to honor Otero, the Republican Governor, with the creation of a county named after him. The boundary of this new county would put the location, and so the jurisdiction of the Fountain case, in the new county. The only thing <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>wanted</b> in exchange was that the sheriff of the new county would be their choice. Once the county was established and Lee's friend, George Curry was appointed sheriff, Lee promptly surrendered. Albert Fall and others defended Lee, McNew and Gilliland, who were charged with and tried in Hillsboro, New Mexico, for the crime of killing Henry Fountain (Albert's young son). No one was ever charged with the murder of Albert Fountain. Charges against McNew were dismissed, while Lee and Gililland were acquitted. Dee Harkey notes that it was interesting that none of the other ranchers indicted were ever pursued as suspects.|$|R
5|$|The Finns faced a {{detrimental}} {{interaction of}} power struggle and breakdown of society during 1917.

During the campaign Veivers' campaign distributed leaflets in the Southport electorate saying that Labor and <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>wanted</b> to legalise homosexuals marrying, adopting children and holding mardi gras parades in Southport. Opposition Leader and Member for Surfers Paradise expressed his concerns to Veivers about the leaflets. Veivers said that he was not [...] "poofter-bashing" [...] but was speaking out against militant homosexuals who wanted to force their ideas on everyone. Lawlor said that these issues were not on the agenda, that it was dirty politics and that it misrepresented the facts and Labor policy, [...] "it is absolute lies".

He agrees with fiscal conservatives in advocating less government spending and decreasing corporate regulation. He is an advocate for freedom of speech. In line with the traditional views of the Libertarian Party, Boortz supports eliminating the War on Drugs, and emphasizing personal responsibility.

In a close election, Cleveland was elected over his Republican opponent, James G. Blaine. Randall also took two tours of the South in 1884 after the election.
