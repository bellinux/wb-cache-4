5000|$|A second project {{involved}} a major renovation of libraries in the Philadelphia library system to establish technologized urban libraries that offered neighborhoods {{across the city}} with state-of-the-art books, media and facilities, as well as staff training. While increased access to print and media made {{a significant difference in}} the literate lives of children and families in those Philadelphia communities, Neuman observed that increased resources alone were not enough to [...] "level the playing field", and close the knowledge and media divide for low-income students. A follow-up study conducted by Neuman and Celano five-years later revealed continued, significant differences in how children from different communities utilized the enriched facilities and accessed media and technology. Children in middle-income communities made far more effective use of library resources for literacy and learning compared to low-income children, as a result of parent support and instruction. By contrast, disadvantaged youngsters without such support made far less effective use of available resources. Neuman and Celano's research highlights the critical role of adult mediation in students’ successful access to the tools of literacy and knowledge acquisition. During hard economic times, Neuman warns against prioritizing capital outlays for technology over budgeted salaries for qualified library staff.

5000|$|Special {{libraries}} {{often have}} a more specific clientele than libraries in traditional educational or public settings, and deal with more specialized kinds of information.

Those that are open to the public may offer services similar to research, reference, public, academic, or children's libraries, often with restrictions such as only lending books to patients at a hospital or restricting the public from parts of a military collection. Many special libraries are not open to the general public, though access may be requested for specialized research by request. Special libraries are also sometimes known as information centers.

50|$|Alice S. Tyler {{graduated}} from the Armour Institute of Technology (now the Illinois Institute of Technology) in Chicago in 1894. In 1895 {{she became the first}} library school graduate on staff at the Cleveland Public Library, where she worked as head of the Catalog Division. From 1900-1913 she served as secretary of the Iowa State Library Commission where she improved existing libraries and established new ones. According to Stuart (2013), “Under Tyler’s leadership, public libraries in Iowa flourished as she oversaw the education of librarians, the expansion of the traveling library system, and the increase of libraries from 41 to 113"(p. 91). She started a summer school at the Iowa State University and served as director from 1901-1912. In reflecting on Tyler’s period in Iowa, Stuart (2013) maintains that “Alice S. Tyler’s thirteen-year tenure in Iowa left a state that had a stronger, more fully developed library system, with more <b>trained</b> <b>librarians,</b> more libraries, and more library buildings. The new library buildings, the vast majority of which were funded by Carnegie grants, were the most visible aspect of the state’s library growth. The documentation indicates that as secretary of the ILC, Tyler did not specifically support or promote that funding. Instead, it is evident that Tyler quickly believed that the Carnegie-funded buildings represented two potential liabilities for Iowa’s communities: the buildings were often designed with poor functionality, and Carnegie’s stipulation of 10 percent support meant that the libraries were essentially underfunded for further growth and development. As it was never politically expedient for Tyler to criticize the potential of Carnegie funding, she attempted in her various writings to mitigate these potentially negative consequences. Unfortunately, her writings also reveal how little influence she had, as Iowa’s communities ultimately received the fourth highest number of Carnegie-funded buildings in the country. Ironically, the development of Iowa’s libraries occurred despite Tyler’s unrelieved misgivings regarding the benefits of Carnegie’s largesse” (p. 106).” From 1913-1929 she served as Director of the School of Library Science at Western Reserve University. She became the third woman President of the American Library Association in 1920-1921. From 1925-1929 she served as Dean of the School of Library Science at Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University). Tyler was appointed Dean Emeritus after her retirement from the University on 13 June 1929.|$|E
40|$|United States {{has been}} largely a concern of the twentieth century, {{and the need for}} librarians {{specially}} prepared to render service in the schools was slow to be recognized. When Katharine L.

So for granted did she take the lack of <b>trained</b> <b>librarians</b> in the schools that she offered suggestions for promoting the use of the library "to the librarian [...] . who {{is supposed to be a}} teacher with no knowledge of library work. " l Twenty years later, in her study of school libraries, Mary E. Hall reported the appointment of but fifty <b>trained</b> <b>librarians</b> to schools from 1905 to 1915, and in that same year C. C.

Not until standards for school libraries and certification for school librarians were developed was the pressure for special preparation for school librarianship sufficiently strong to influence, to any appreciable extent, the curricula of library schools, and to interest the normal schools and teachers colleges in assuming responsibility for the preparation of library personnel as well as teachers.
