5|$|Ayers Rock's <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> Australian radio {{stations}} during the 1970s {{was related to}} the popularity of AM. Unlike the US, which had a vibrant FM radio scene, in 1976 Australia only had ABC FM and a few community FM stations which primarily played classical music. Commercial AM stations, playing pop and rock music, dominated the local airwaves. The group established their reputation with live performances, exposure in print media, and word of mouth, with minimal Australian radio promotion.|$|E

Imaging of the spine to ascertain presence of SCI may need to wait if emergency surgery is needed to stabilize a life-threatening injury. Acute SCI merits treatment in an intensive care unit, especially injuries to the cervival spinal cord.

5|$|A Norman medieval chronicler {{claimed that}} Robert {{travelled}} to Normandy in 1051 or 1052 and told Duke William of Normandy, the future William the Conqueror, that Edward wished {{for him to}} become his heir. The exact timing of Robert's trip, and whether he actually made it, {{have been the subject}} of debate among historians. The archbishop died in exile at Jumièges sometime between 1052 and 1055. Robert commissioned significant building work at Jumièges and was probably involved in the first Romanesque building in England, the church built in Westminster for Edward the Confessor, now known as Westminster Abbey. Robert's <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> the English was used by William the Conqueror as one of the justifications for his invasion of England.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a captive}} from Barcoor, {{pregnant}} women often gave birth en route, and their babies {{had to be}} borne bundled about them. When they rested, the infants were suspended in cradles from the branches of trees. If anyone happened to die they were buried on the spot. Captives were not given any rations, and {{when the time came}} to move on, those who had not finished cooking had to leave behind their rice and the cooking pots. The Barcoor Manuscript along with other British Government records suggest that 20,000 captives (one-third of the total) died on the march to Seringapatam due to hunger, disease, and ill <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> soldiers. The journey to Seringapatam took six weeks. By 1787, some 30,000 captives, half the original number, had perished.|$|E
5|$|According to the Barcoor Manuscript, {{written in}} Kannada by a Mangalorean Catholic from Barcoor {{after his return}} from Seringapatam, 20,000 of them (one-third) died on the march to Seringapatam due to hunger, disease, and ill <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> the soldiers. At the camp at Jamalabad fort, Mangalorean Catholic leaders were thrown down from the fort. All Christian churches in South Canara, except the Hospet Church at Hospet and the Monte Mariano Church at Farangipet, were razed {{to the ground and}} all land owned by the {{captured}} Christians was taken over by Tipu and distributed among his favourites.

5|$|After playing League cricket for Blackpool in 1939, on the {{outbreak}} of war Larwood left the game altogether, to work away from the public eye as a market gardener. In 1946 he used his savings to buy a sweet shop in Blackpool. Although he generally kept away from organised cricket and avoided all personal publicity, he was persuaded to attend a farewell luncheon for Don Bradman {{at the end of}} the Australians' 1948 tour. He and Bradman exchanged polite courtesies, though he was warmly welcomed by other members of the Australian team, including their premier fast bowler Ray Lindwall. The following year Larwood became one of 26 former professional Test cricketers awarded honorary membership of the MCC. This recognition, he said, went some way to help heal the hurt he had felt over his <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> the game's ruling body 15 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Angry at his <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> the Byers enquiry, Scott sought {{other means}} of {{pursuing}} his vendetta against Thorpe. In June 1971 he met Gordon Winter, a South African journalist who was also an agent for the South African intelligence agency BOSS. Scott provided details of his supposed seduction by Thorpe, a story which Winter assured his BOSS masters would destroy Thorpe and the Liberal Party. He found that no newspaper would print the story on largely uncorroborated and unreliable evidence. In March 1972 Scott's friend Gwen Parry-Jones died; Scott used the inquest to denounce Thorpe for ruining his life and driving Parry-Jones to her death. None of these accusations was published. Depressed, Scott retreated {{into a state of}} torpor, assisted by tranquilisers, and for a while presented no threat to Thorpe.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from his}} <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> Bradman, Larwood was {{successful}} in 1930, rising to fourth place in the national bowling averages (99 wickets at 16.38). He also batted well on occasions, including a not-out century against Northamptonshire. He was not selected for the 1930–31 tour of South Africa, {{and for the next}} two years he concentrated mainly on domestic cricket. He made one Test appearance in 1931, against New Zealand, in a rain-ruined game in which he neither batted nor bowled. He headed the domestic bowling averages in 1931 and 1932, in the latter year with 162 wickets at 12.86, the best seasonal figures of his career. However, because of his poor Test record in 1930, Larwood thought his chances of selection for the 1932–33 tour to Australia were slim. The 1932 Test trial was limited to half a day's play, during which Larwood bowled 15 overs for a single wicket. Nevertheless, to his great relief he was selected for the tour, as was Voce, who had been England's most successful bowler during the South African tour of 1930–31.|$|E

5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{feared that}} they would be assassinated, and taught their {{followers}} that their deaths would be {{similar to those of the}} two witnesses of the Book of Revelation. Balch and Taylor believe that Applewhite's prison experience and early rejection by audiences contributed to this fear. Applewhite and Nettles later explained to their followers that the former's <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> the press was a form of assassination and had fulfilled their prophecy. Applewhite took a materialistic view of the Bible, seeing it as a record of extraterrestrial contact with humanity. He drew heavily from the Book of Revelation, although he avoided traditional theological terminology and took a somewhat negative tone towards Christianity. He only lectured about a small number of verses and never tried to develop a system of theology.|$|E
5|$|At Simpson's next race, the four-day Grand Prix d'Eibar, {{his first}} in Spain, his knee injury still bothered him. He won the second stage, but {{was forced to}} quit during the {{following}} stage. His injury had not healed, even after <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> various specialists, but for financial reasons {{he was forced to}} enter the Tour de France with the British team. He abandoned on stage three, which started in Roubaix, struggling to pedal on the cobbles. Three months after his fall at Paris–Roubaix he saw a doctor at St. Michael's Hospital in Paris. He gave Simpson injections in his knee, which reduced the inflammation. Once healed, he competed in the road world championships in Berne, Switzerland. On the track he qualified for the individual pursuit with the fourth-fastest time, losing in the quarter-finals to Peter Post of the Netherlands. In the road race, Simpson was part of a seventeen-rider breakaway that finished together in a sprint; he crossed the line in ninth place.|$|E
