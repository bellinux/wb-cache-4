In men this relationship also exists, but <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>is</b> only five-fold in those over 20 percent above their ideal body weight.|$|E

5|$|Western jackdaws inhabit wooded steppes, pastures, {{cultivated}} land, coastal cliffs, and towns. They thrive when forested {{areas are}} cleared and converted to fields and open areas. Habitats {{with a mix}} of large trees, buildings, and open ground are preferred; open fields are left to the rook, and more wooded areas to the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius). Along with other corvids such as the rook, common raven (Corvus corax), and hooded crow (C. cornix), some western jackdaws spend the winter in urban parks; populations measured in three urban parks in Warsaw show increases from October to December, possibly due to western jackdaws migrating there from areas further north. The same data from Warsaw, collected from 1977 to 2003, showed that the wintering western jackdaw population had increased four-fold.

25|$|The {{high cost}} of IGCC is the biggest {{obstacle}} to its integration in the power market; however, most energy executives recognize that carbon regulation is coming soon. Bills requiring carbon reduction are being proposed again both the House and the Senate, and with the Democratic majority {{it seems likely that}} with the next President there will be a greater push for carbon regulation. The Supreme Court decision requiring the EPA to regulate carbon (Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency et al.) also speaks to the likelihood of future carbon regulations coming sooner, rather than later. With carbon capture, the cost of electricity from an IGCC plant would increase approximately 33%. For a natural gas CC, <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>is</b> approximately 46%. For a pulverized coal plant, <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>is</b> approximately 57%. This potential for less expensive carbon capture makes IGCC an attractive choice for keeping low cost coal an available fuel source in a carbon constrained world. However, the industry needs a lot more experience to reduce the risk premium. IGCC with CCS requires some sort of mandate, higher carbon market price, or regulatory framework to properly incentivize the industry.|$|E

25|$|The {{main concern}} with {{gasoline}} on the environment, {{aside from the}} complications of its extraction and refining, is the potential effect on the climate through the production of carbon dioxide.

Vapor pressure initially rises with some addition of ethanol to gasoline, but <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>is</b> greatest at 10% by volume. At higher concentrations of ethanol above 10%, the vapor pressure of the blend starts to decrease. At a 10% ethanol by volume, the rise in vapor pressure may potentially increase the problem of photochemical smog. This rise in vapor pressure could be mitigated by increasing or decreasing the percentage of ethanol in the gasoline mixture.|$|E
25|$|Another set of {{significant}} physical changes during puberty happen in bodily distribution {{of fat and}} muscle. This process is different for females and males.
