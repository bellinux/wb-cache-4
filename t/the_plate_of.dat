25|$|Leakage is {{equivalent}} to a resistor in parallel with the capacitor. Constant exposure to heat can cause dielectric breakdown and excessive leakage, a problem often seen in older vacuum tube circuits, particularly where oiled paper and foil capacitors were used. In many vacuum tube circuits, interstage coupling capacitors are used to conduct a varying signal from <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage. A leaky capacitor can cause the grid circuit voltage to be raised from its normal bias setting, causing excessive current or signal distortion in the downstream tube. In power amplifiers this can cause the plates to glow red, or current limiting resistors to overheat, even fail. Similar considerations apply to component fabricated solid-state (transistor) amplifiers, but owing to lower heat production {{and the use of}} modern polyester dielectric barriers this once-common problem has become relatively rare.|$|E

Peter Griffiths interpreted them as immature eggs in 1993. However, later researchers have doubted their {{connection to the}} genus because they were found outside the body cavity of the animal. A well-preserved fossil of a Sinosauropteryx, a genus related to Compsognathus, shows two oviducts bearing two unlaid eggs. These proportionally larger and less numerous eggs of Sinosauropteryx cast further doubt on the original identification of the purported Compsognathus eggs. In 1964 German geologist Karl Werner Barthel had explained the discs as gas bubbles formed in the sediment because of the putrefaction of the carcass.|$|E

40|$|When a {{dielectric}} {{is placed}} between <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> <b>of</b> a parallel <b>plate</b> capacitor, <b>the</b> capacitance increases, so charge {{can be stored}} at a smaller potential.

500|$|Another {{traditional}} assumption, {{based on}} {{the language of the}} inventories and shared by almost all writers, was that the cup was a piece of secular plate, for use at table, or display on a buffet beside it. The buffet of the period was more like a modern Welsh dresser or shop display unit, with receding shelves for displaying on important occasions all <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> the household that was not in use. [...] Neil Stratford suggests that the cup was only used to drink from on special occasions, including St Agnes' feast day, while Lightbown remarks that at over four pounds in weight the cup is much too heavy to drink from conveniently. [...] However John Cherry, noting the exclusively religious subjects depicted (including that on the lost tripod stand) considers that the cup may have been intended as a ciborium from the start. It might have been used either to accompany in its carrying case the duke on his tours of his many castles and palaces, or perhaps for his foundation of the Saint Chapelle at his capital of Bourges, intended to rival the king's Sainte-Chapelle in Paris and his brother's foundation at Champmol in Dijon.|$|E

[...] Thomas Jefferson made two drawings of the Hammond–Harwood House when he served the government in Annapolis in 1783–4. One could assume that Jefferson recognized the house as derived from Palladio because his knowledge of The Four Books of Architecture was extensive. He referred to the book as his architectural “bible” and <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> the Villa Cornaro follows the Villa Pisani plate; and directly opposite the Villa Cornaro in some 18th-century English transcriptions of the work.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{distinctive}} badge {{awarded to}} the regiment was the sphinx for service in Egypt, authorised in 1802. From 1814, a stringed bugle-horn had been the approved badge of light infantry and rifle regiments. When the 13th Foot were converted to light infantry in 1822, the badge adopted for the shako head-dress was a [...] "bugle-horn with strings with the numerals 13 in the centre and surmounted by the Sphinx". When {{a new model of}} shako was adopted in 1844, a mural crown and scroll inscribed [...] "Jellalabad" [...] were added. Similar devices were used on <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> the home service helmet adopted in 1878. In 1898, when khaki service dress was introduced, a metal badge was designed for the new slouch hat. This consisted of a bugle surmounted by a mural crown above which was a scroll inscribed [...] "Jellalabad". The cypher [...] "PA" [...] for Prince Albert was placed within the strings of the bugle horn. This remained the regiment's cap badge on various forms of head-dress until amalgamation.|$|E

Fourteen years prior, Ammaron told Mormon to dig up only <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> <b>of</b> Nephi and update them with the current doings of the Nephites.

The earliest known examples of printed bookplates are German, and date from the 15th century. One of the best known is a small hand-coloured woodcut representing a shield of arms supported by an angel, which was pasted into books presented to the Carthusian monastery of Buxheim by Brother Hildebrand Brandenburg of Biberach, about the year 1480—the date being fixed by that of the recorded gift. The woodcut, in imitation of similar devices in old manuscripts, is hand-painted. An example of this bookplate {{can be found in the}} Farber Archives of Brandeis University.
