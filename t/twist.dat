5|$|Next, {{the train}} passes through two {{consecutive}} horseshoe turns, {{first to the}} right and then to the left. As the name suggests, Horseshoe turns are highly banked horseshoe-shaped turns which feature track entering from roughly the same direction as where it exits. As the train exits the second horseshoe, it swoops down and begins a 270-degree helix to the right, which leads into the ride's second inversion, an inline <b>twist.</b> The inline <b>twist</b> sees riders perform a full rotation around the track, starting from a position where they are facing downward. After completing the <b>twist,</b> the train reaches the brake run and a final right-hand turn that leads back into the station.|$|E

5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has played}} an enormous role in refining the wings, control and sensory systems, {{and anything else}} that affects aerodynamics or kinematics. One noteworthy trait is wing <b>twist.</b> Most insect wings are twisted, as are helicopter blades, with a higher angle of attack at the base. The <b>twist</b> generally is between 10 and 20 degrees. In addition to this <b>twist,</b> the wing surfaces are not necessarily flat or featureless; most larger insects have wing membranes distorted and angled between the veins {{in such a way that}} the cross-section of the wings approximates an airfoil. Thus, the wing's basic shape already is capable of generating a small amount of lift at zero angle of attack. Most insects control their wings by adjusting tilt, stiffness, and flapping frequency of the wings with tiny muscles in the thorax (below). Some insects evolved other wing features that are not advantageous for flight, but play a role in something else, such as mating or protection.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{examination}} of the bullet can exclude {{a large number of}} weapons by examining the general characteristics of a recovered bullet. By determining general aspects of the fired ammunition, a number of weapons can be immediately excluded as being incapable of firing that type of bullet. The make and model of the weapon can also be inferred from the combination of different class characteristics that are common to specific manufactures. The three main class characteristics of all bullets are the lands and grooves, the caliber of the bullet, and the rifling <b>twist.</b> All three can be tied directly to the type of barrel that was used to fire the bullet. The lands and grooves of barrel are the bumps and valleys created when the rifling is created. The caliber is the diameter of the barrel. The <b>twist</b> is the direction of the striations left by the barrel's rifling, clockwise (right-handed) or counterclockwise (left-handed). Most barrels will have a right-handed <b>twist</b> with the exception of weapons created by the Colt's Manufacturing Company which uses left-handed twists. Weapon barrels that match the class characteristics of recovered bullets can be examined further for individual characteristics to determine if the bullet came from that particular weapon.|$|E
