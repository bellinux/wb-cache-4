On one road trip, Turner and a teammate got into a scuffle after that player knocked Turner's tray in a fast-food joint. The coach told Turner to cool it but once <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> on campus, Turner exacted retribution.

25|$|Lagun Ein {{was not yet}} off the hook. The king {{assigned}} him to lead {{another attempt}} on Minkhaung. Lagun Ein led a team of 12 commandos to infiltrate the Ava camp. The team made it inside the camp from the lightly guarded north side. He and five men managed to get inside the Ava king's quarters. But the plan was foiled when a concubine of Minkhaung saw them and screamed. She was killed but the king escaped. Lagun Ein and his men took Minkhaung's ruby-studded royal sword and gold-plated betel nut chest. They barely escaped. When <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>back,</b> Saw Pyei Chantha, Minkhaung's daughter who had been captured in early 1408 and put in Razadarit's harem, identified that the sword and the chest were her father's.

500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode {{three and a half}} stars out of five and called it [...] "an {{exercise}} in nostalgia". The two called the episode [...] "touching" [...] and noted that many of the in-jokes in the script, such as Harrison asking the agents how <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> from Antarctica, were [...] "very funny". Shearman and Pearson, however, did slightly critique the way the X-Files were presented noting that the case was comparatively a [...] "rather low-key humdrum affair". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a positive review, writing, [...] "The future of The X-Files is unsettled, but 'Alone' served as a pleasant reminder of what has come before and why the journey to this point has, for the most part, been so wonderful." ...|$|E
500|$|While Monroe {{remains a}} {{cultural}} icon, critics are divided on her legacy as an actress. David Thomson called her {{body of work}} [...] "insubstantial" [...] and Pauline Kael wrote {{that she could not}} act, but rather [...] "used her lack of an actress's skills to amuse the public. She had the wit or crassness or desperation to turn cheesecake into acting – and vice versa; she did what others had the 'good taste' not to do". In contrast, according to Peter Bradshaw, Monroe was a talented comedian who [...] "understood how comedy achieved its effects", and [...] Roger Ebert wrote that [...] "Monroe's eccentricities and neuroses on sets became notorious, but studios put up with her long after any other actress would have been blackballed because what <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> on the screen was magical". Similarly, Jonathan Rosenbaum stated that [...] "she subtly subverted the sexist content of her material" [...] and that [...] "the difficulty some people have discerning Monroe's intelligence as an actress seems rooted in the ideology of a repressive era, when superfeminine women weren't supposed to be smart".|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 6 October 1965, Hindley drove Brady to Manchester Central railway station, where she waited outside in the car while he {{selected}} their victim. After a few minutes Brady reappeared {{in the company of}} Edward Evans, to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister. After they had driven back home and relaxed over a bottle of wine, Brady sent Hindley to fetch her brother-in-law. When <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> to the house Hindley told Smith to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light. When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for [...] "the miniature wine bottles". Brady led Smith into the kitchen and left him there, saying {{that he was going to}} collect the wine. A few minutes later, Smith heard a scream, followed by Hindley shouting loudly for him to come and help. Smith entered the living room to find Brady repeatedly striking Evans with the flat of an axe, and watched as he then throttled Evans with a length of electrical cord. Evans's body was too heavy for Smith to carry to the car on his own—Brady had sprained his ankle in the struggle—so they wrapped it in plastic sheeting and put it in the spare bedroom.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} also subject to less {{favorable}} reviews from critics who were {{disappointed with the}} gaps in Michael and Walt's story. Steve Heisler of Time Out [...] "wasn't all-too-pleased", citing the story's predictability. TMZ's Daniel called [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] "solid, but not spectacular" [...] {{and gave it a}} grade of a [...] "C+", writing that [...] "this episode fell a little short … I feel like we were kind of robbed of half of the 'What Happened to Michael?' story. It was interesting to see how far into depression he sunk … And they did give him a pretty good reason for working for Ben … But I can't shake the feeling that we missed a good opportunity". He further commented that [...] "Tom would make a great football coach—his motivational speeches are awesome." [...] TV Squad's Erin Martell was unsatisfied with Michael's flashback and the lack of Walt, asking [...] "What was their cover story when <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> to the mainland? … they couldn't do a genuine flashback scene because of … Kelley's growth spurt, but they could have worked around that." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV ranked it as the second worst episode of the season; his colleague John Kubicek was also critical, and commented that the flashback [...] "essentially tells us things we already know without telling us much more." ...|$|E
500|$|Chandler and the Experience {{found time}} to record between {{performances}} in Europe. They began on October 23, recording [...] "Hey Joe" [...] at De Lane Lea Studios, with Chandler as producer and Dave Siddle as engineer. The song featured backing vocals by the Breakaways. Soon after the session began, Chandler asked Hendrix to turn his guitar amplifier down, and an argument ensued. Chandler commented: [...] "Jimi threw a tantrum because I wouldn't let him play guitar loud enough... He was playing a Marshall twin stack, {{and it was so}} loud in the studio that we were picking up various rattles and noises." [...] According to Chandler, Hendrix then threatened to leave England, stating: [...] "If I can't play as loud as I want, I might as well go back to New York." [...] Chandler, who had Hendrix's immigration papers and passport in his back pocket, laid the documents on the mixing console and told Hendrix to [...] "piss off". Hendrix laughed and said: [...] "All right, you called my bluff", and <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> to work. Redding wrote in his diary that they completed two songs during the October 23 session, but the second one has never been positively identified. Author Sean Egan speculated that it might have been Howlin' Wolf's [...] "Killing Floor" [...] or Wilson Pickett's [...] "Land of a Thousand Dances". Chandler decided that they should use an Experience original for the B-side of the single, so he encouraged Hendrix to start writing; he composed his first Experience song, [...] "Stone Free", the following day. Chandler, in an effort to minimize studio expenses, purchased rehearsal time at the Aberbach House in London. He abandoned this practice after realizing how quickly the group could learn songs while warming up in the studio. On November 2, 1966, the Experience returned to De Lane Lea to continue work on their first single. During the session, they recorded [...] "Stone Free" [...] and a demo version of [...] "Can You See Me". This marked {{the first time that the}} Experience recorded a song that was eventually included on the original UK release of the album.|$|E

2500|$|April Wingate (Series 6–9) (Linda Regan) – April {{worked as}} a hairdresser before joining Maplins in 1960. She is portrayed as a rather childish character, such as wanting to see Bambi at the cinema for her birthday. During her time at Maplins she began a {{relationship}} with Spike, and eventually decided {{she would like to}} marry him and live in a bungalow. Spike also wanted to get married, but did not want to give up being a comic in favour of a steady job, which upset April.

2500|$|After the battle, the Army of Italy was {{hemmed in}} between the crests of the Ligurian Alps on {{the north and the}} Ligurian Sea on the south. During the course of the war, the Italian Riviera had been denuded of {{supplies}} so provisions had to be shipped from France in order to sustain the army. The supply convoys were often held up by foul winds or British warships. On top of this, the soldiers had not been paid in five months and their clothing and shoes were worn out. In these conditions, many men deserted but soon the soldiers broke out in mutiny. In one incident, Championnet and Suchet were faced with 3,000 mutineers who had only received rations on six days out of the last thirty. They somehow convinced the soldiers to return to duty. The men of the Genoa garrison announced to Saint-Cyr that they were marching back to France. The general dissuaded them by pointing out that they would certainly starve to death on the long march along the Riviera. Fortunately, supply ships reached Genoa just in time. Watrin's division abandoned its positions, leaving only their officers and sous-officiers holding Bocchetta Pass. The men were only persuaded to stop by the news that the Genoa garrison had decided to remain; <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> before the Austrians could seize the pass.
