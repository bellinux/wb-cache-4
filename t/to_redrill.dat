The most desirable new trajectory would maximize reservoir size and minimize water diversion to an older abandoned reservoir. Based on a simple model using Muskatâ€™s analysis {{it was determined that}} the new well should be drilled near the old one since water diversion considerations outweighed the advantages of a larger reservoir...|$|R
