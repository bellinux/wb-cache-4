5|$|As Chen {{was born}} in a culture other than the culture he now lives in, he tries to make games that appeal universally to all people. His goal with his games is to help video games mature as a medium by making games that inspire {{emotional}} responses in the player that other games are lacking. Although he and Thatgamecompany can and have made more traditional games, he does not plan on commercially developing any of them, as he does not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> fits with their goals as an independent video game developer.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, 2012, on {{the episode}} hosted by Jonah Hill, Palin was {{impersonated}} by Andy Samberg in the Weekend Update segment.

That's not, like, a revelation – you knew {{just by looking}} at her… She would have died eventually, the way she was going, but what really killed her was the bulimia… I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> left her weaker and more susceptible. Had she not had an eating disorder, she would have been physically stronger.|$|E
25|$|Many {{art historians}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is an allegory of painting, hence the {{alternative}} {{title of the}} painting. Its composition and iconography make it the most complex Vermeer work of all.|$|E
25|$|The book {{is famous}} for its rich {{depiction}} of New Orleans and the city's dialects, including Yat. Many locals and writers <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is the best and most accurate depiction of the city in a work of fiction.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{the opening}} sixteen minutes contain no English language, {{which made the}} audiences <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a foreign subtitled film, and caused walk-outs. Consequently, this {{prompted}} movie theatres to put a disclaimer on lobby cards asserting {{that for the most}} part, it was an English-language film.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, it was {{proposed}} that Martian Crustal Dichotomy {{was created by}} plate tectonic processes. Scientists today disagree, and <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was created either by upwelling within the Martian mantle that thickened the crust of the Southern Highlands and formed Tharsis or by a giant impact that excavated the Northern Lowlands.|$|E
25|$|The {{manuscript}} is {{a complicated}} text containing many layers of collaborative writing, revision, and censorship. Scholars of the play <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was originally written by playwrights Anthony Munday and Henry Chettle and some years later heavily revised by another team of playwrights, including Thomas Heywood, Thomas Dekker, and William Shakespeare.|$|E

25|$|Before Kim Jong-un {{had been}} {{confirmed}} as Kim Jong-il's successor and Kim Jong-chul was groomed as the country's next leader, a limited set of Kim Jong-chul badges were reportedly made {{and given to}} cabinet, party, and army officials.

25|$|The Meshchera {{language}} is unattested, and theories on its affiliation remain speculative. Some linguists <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{might have been}} a dialect of Mordvinic, while Pauli Rahkonen has suggested on the basis of toponymic evidence that it was a Permic or closely related language. Rahkonen's speculation has been criticized by other scientists, such as by the Russian Uralist Vladimir Napolskikh. Nowadays, Mishar Tatar dialect is a Turkic language.|$|E
25|$|One {{component}} of the young child's linguistic environment is child-directed speech (also known as baby talk or motherese), which is language spoken in a higher pitch than normal with simple words and sentences. Although the importance of its role in developing language has been debated, many linguists <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may aid in capturing the infant's attention and maintaining communication. When children begin to communicate with adults, this motherese speech allows the child the ability to discern the patterns in language and to experiment with language.|$|E

While traveling, the group stops to eat and lets Quixote out of the cage, and he gets into a fight with a {{goatherd}} and with a group of pilgrims, who beat him into submission, and he is finally brought home.

25|$|District Councillor Amy Yung Wing-sheung, {{who lives}} in Discovery Bay, said the company was not {{conducting}} a proper consultation. She said the company had gone ahead with its plan after proposals were rejected unanimously at a recent Passenger Liaison Group meeting.

25|$|The two, at {{the extreme}} of their rivalry, {{climbing}} the road wrapped like a ribbon round the majestic volcano, terribly steep, in parallel action... I've always been convinced that in these moments that supreme player of poker, the Norman , used his craftiness and his fearless bluffing to win his fifth Tour. Because, to me, {{it was clear that}} Anquetil was at the very limit of his strength and that had Poulidor attacked him repeatedly and suddenly then he would have cracked... Although his advisers claim that his error in maintaining steady pressure rather than attacking was the result of using slightly too big a gear, which stopped his jumping away, I still <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was in his head that Pou-Pou should have changed gears.|$|E

25|$|Some {{authorities}} also {{equate the}} town named Menapia (or Manapia) as Wexford town – others place it further {{north along the}} east coast, roughly near Wicklow town. A river called the Modonnu(s), whose estuary is near Menapia, is often {{said to be the}} Slaney – others think it is the Avoka river. It is because the Slaney is the only major river in the south-east that many as a result <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is the Modonnu(s) river, thereby making Menapia equal to Wexford town (this theory only seems to work if Hook Head is made the Sacred Cape). Most authorities seem to agree that Menapia is not Wexford, but is a town located further north along the coast. However, this is not certain.|$|E
25|$|On June 14, 2013, Jalisco {{authorities}} {{confirmed that}} they were officially opening an investigation to locate Tobares. Argentine consular officials stated that they had filed a formal request to Jalisco authorities on June 10 and were collaborating with them. Tobares' friends told officials that {{he was planning to}} visit Sayulita and Tepic, Nayarit. Investigators in Mexico and Argentina discarded two leads that were initially thought plausible. They do not believe that Tobares purposely decided to cut ties with his family and friends to disappear on his own will. Tobares was looking for a new job opportunity in Guadalajara (he had his passport and other legal documentation ready), which made investigators <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was unlikely that Tobares would go into hiding or cut communication with those close to him.|$|E
25|$|Such a {{phenomenon}} was observed, but not photographed, in the Owens Valley of California. Early {{in the morning}} with no wind, thin clouds were observed to form above the valley. The distinction was that they were created alternately and moved in opposite directions away from a central location on the valley floor, suggesting the existence of an inaudible free convection whistle. The reason for including this type of whistle is that we tend to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is necessary for a forced jet flow to encounter a solid material to create a whistle. Perhaps it would be more correct to generalize the concept to a particular impedance mismatch rather than a solid object. The Hartmann whistle and the jet screech fits into this generalization. The concept also applies to any fluid motion as opposed to a strictly forced flow.|$|E
