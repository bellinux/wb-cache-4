40|$|The {{complexity}} of {{software running on}} vehicular embedded systems is constantly increasing and this negatively affects its development costs and time to market. One {{way to deal with}} these issues is to boost abstraction in the form of models to (i) ease the reasoning about the system architecture, (ii) automate certain stages of the development, (iii) early detect flaws in the system architecture through fundamental analysis and (iv) take appropriate countermeasures before the system is implemented. Considering the importance of timing requirements in the design of software for vehicular embedded systems, in this licentiate thesis we leverage Model-Driven Engineering for realizing a semi-automatic approach which allows the developer to perform end-to-end delay timing analysis on design models, without having to manually model <b>timing</b> <b>elements</b> and set their values. The proposed approach, starting from a design model of an automotive software functionality, automatically generates a set of models enriched with <b>timing</b> <b>elements</b> whose values are set at generation time.

Molecular correlates of clock function reveal that period and timeless expression is highly rhythmic in brains and clear-painted antennae, while rhythmic clock gene expression is disrupted in black-painted antennae. Our work shows that clock outputs from each antenna are processed and integrated together in the monarch time-compensated sun compass circuit.

40|$|Transient {{elevations}} in {{the concentration}} of free cytosolic calcium ion ([Ca 2 +]i) promote cell phase transitions in early embryonic division and persist even if these transitions are blocked. These observations suggest that a [Ca 2 +]i oscillator is an essential <b>timing</b> <b>element</b> of the early embryonic “master clock. ” We explore this possibility by coupling a [Ca 2 +]i oscillator model to an early embryonic cell cycle model based on the protein interactions that govern {{the activity of the}} M-phase-promoting factor (MPF). We hypothesize three dynamical states of the MPF system and choose parameter sets to represent each. We then investigate how [Ca 2 +]i dynamics may control early embryonic division in both sea urchin and Xenopus embryos. To investigate both systems, distinct [Ca 2 +]i profiles matching those observed in sea urchin embryos (in which [Ca 2 +]i exhibits sharp transients) and Xenopus embryos (in which [Ca 2 +]i is elevated and oscillates sinusoidally) are imposed on each of the hypothesized dynamical states of MPF. In the first hypothesis, [Ca 2 +]i oscillations entrain the autonomous MPF oscillator. In the second and third hypotheses, where the MPF system rests in excitatory and bistable states, respectively, [Ca 2 +]i oscillations drive MPF activation cycles. Simulation results show that hypotheses two and three, in which a [Ca 2 +]i oscillator is a fundamental <b>timing</b> <b>element</b> of the master clock, best account for key experimental observations and the questions that they raise. Finally, we propose experiments to elucidate further [Ca 2 +]i regulation and the fundamental components of the early embryonic master clock...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Flip-flops are {{critical}} <b>timing</b> <b>elements</b> in digital circuits {{which have a}} large impact on circuit speed and power consumption. The performance of the Flip-Flop is an important element to determine {{the performance of the}} whole synchronous circuit. In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for high-speed digital circuits at low power consumption. High leakage current in deep-submicron regions is becoming a significant contributor to power dissipation of CMOS circuits as threshold voltage, channel length, and gate oxide thickness are reduced. Therefore, identification and modeling of different leakage components is very important for estimation and reduction of leakage power, especially for battery operated portable low-power applications. This paper targets the power reduction in a conventional flip-flop at the circuit level by introducing power gating with the sleep transistor for the reduction of leakage power. It is proposed that while the flip-flop is in the active mode, the power optimization is achieved through dual edge triggering and when the flip-flop is not in the standby mode, the leakage power is optimized through power gating scheme...|$|R

We examine poweroptimal pipelining in deep submicron technology, both analytically and by simulation. Simulation uses a 70 nm predictive process with a fanout-of-four inverter chain model including input/output flipflops, and results are shown to match theory well. The simulation results show that power-optimal logic depth is 6 to 8 FO 4 and optimal power saving varies from 55 to 80 % compared to a 24 FO 4 logic depth, depending on threshold voltage, activity factor, and presence of clock-gating. We decompose the power consumption of a circuit into three components, switching power, leakage power, and idle power, and present the following insights into power-optimal pipelining. First, power-optimal logic depth decreases and optimal power savings increase for larger activity factors, where switching power dominates over leakage and idle power. Second, pipelining is more effective with lower threshold voltages at high activity factors, but higher threshold voltages give better results at lower activity factors where leakage current dominates. Lastly, clock-gating enables deeper pipelining and more power saving because it reduces <b>timing</b> <b>element</b> overhead when the activity factor is low...|$|E

This reflects that traditional valuation metrics might tell us whether a stock is potentially cheap or expensive but little about when or if it will experience a market correction. Two indicators have come to the fore in recent years that provide useful insights in a number of contexts as to the likely performance of stocks: sentiment/momentum and accounting fundamentals/financial health. We examine the impact of both of these indicators, both in isolation and combination, on value and growth stocks and find that (i) the are effective in introducing a <b>timing</b> <b>element</b> into the selection of both value and growth stocks, (ii) the sentiment indicator completely dominates the financial health indicator when trying to identify the better value stocks, and (iii) both indictors contribute to the identification of the good and bad growth stocks.

40|$|Abstract Children with {{specific}} language impairment (SLI) {{are thought to}} have an inherited form of language impairment that spares other developmental domains. SLI shows strong heritability and recent linkage and association studies have replicated results for candidate genes. Regulatory regions of the genes may be involved. Behavioral growth models of language development of children with SLI reveal that the onset of language is delayed, and the growth trajectories of children with SLI parallel those of younger children without SLI. The rate of language acquisition decelerates in the pre-adolescent period, resulting in immature language levels for the children with SLI that persist into adolescence and beyond. Recent genetic and epigenetic discoveries and models relevant to language impairment are reviewed. T cell regulation of onset, acceleration, and deceleration signaling are described as potential conceptual parallels to the growth <b>timing</b> <b>elements</b> of language acquisition and impairment. A growth signaling disruption (GSD) hypothesis is proposed for SLI, which posits that faulty timing mechanisms at the cellular level, intrinsic to neurocortical functioning essential for language onset and growth regulation, are {{at the core of the}} growth outcomes of SLI.
