500|$|Samuel R. Delany {{was one of}} {{the first}} openly gay science fiction authors; in his {{earliest}} stories the gay sexual aspect appears as a [...] "sensibility", rather than in overt sexual references. In some stories, such as Babel-17 (1966), same-sex love and same-sex intercourse are clearly implied but are given a kind of protective colouration because the protagonist is a woman who is involved in a three-person marriage with two men. The affection all three characters share for each other is in the forefront, and sexual activity between or among them is not directly described. In Dhalgren (1975), his most famous science fiction novel, Delany peoples his large canvas with characters of a wide variety of sexualities. Once again, sexual activity is not the focus of the novel although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the first explicitly described scenes of gay sex in SF and Delany depicts characters with a wide variety of motivations and behaviours.|$|E
500|$|Following the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention of 1787, a {{fatigued}} Washington {{returned to}} his estate, Mount Vernon. He seemed intent on resuming his retirement and letting others govern the nation with its new frame of government. The American public at large, however, wanted no one but Washington to be the nation's first president. The first U.S. presidential campaign was in essence what today would be called a grassroots effort to convince Washington to accept the office. Letters poured into Mount Vernon informing him of public sentiment and imploring him to accept; [...] from former comrades in arms, and from across the Atlantic. Gouverneur Morris urged Washington to accept, writing [...] " [...] thirteen horses now about to be coupled together, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> every race and character. They will listen to your voice and submit to your control. You therefore must, I say must mount this seat." [...] Alexander Hamilton {{was one of the}} most dedicated in his efforts to get Washington to accept the presidency, as he foresaw himself receiving a powerful position in the administration. The comte de Rochambeau urged Washington to accept, as did the Marquis de Lafayette, who exhorted Washington to [...] "not to deny your acceptance of the office of President for the first years." [...] Washington replied [...] "Let those follow the pursuits of ambition and fame, who have a keener relish for them, or who may have more years, in store, for the enjoyment." [...] In an August 1788 letter, Washington further expounded on his feelings regarding the election, stating, ...|$|E

2500|$|Opinions vary among magicians {{as to how}} to {{categorize}} a given effect, and disagreement as to what categories actually exist. For instance, some magicians consider [...] "penetrations" [...] a separate category, while others consider penetrations a form of restoration or teleportation. Some magicians today, such as Guy Hollingworth and Tom Stone have begun to challenge the notion that all magic effects fit into a limited number of categories. Among magicians who believe in a limited number of categories (such as Dariel Fitzkee, Harlan Tarbell, S.H. Sharpe), there has been disagreement as to how many different types of effects <b>there</b> <b>are.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> these are listed below.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{the name}} of Zoroaster is not {{mentioned}} in the Qur'an, still he was regarded as one of those prophets whose names have not been mentioned in the Qur'an, for there is a verse in the Qur'an: [...] "And We did send apostles before thee: <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them that We have mentioned to thee and there are others whom We have not mentioned to Thee." [...] (40 : 78). Accordingly, the Muslims treated the founder of Zoroastrianism as a true prophet and believed in his religion as they did in other inspired creeds, and thus according to the prophecy, protected the Zoroastrian religion. James Darmesteter remarked in the translation of Zend Avesta: [...] "When Islam assimilated the Zoroastrians to the People of the Book, it evinced a rare historical sense and solved the problem of the origin of the Avesta."

2500|$|In a June 2003 interview, Maida {{explained}} that lyrically, his {{words on the}} album would follow the music and would be very much {{a product of the}} times. [...] "I think it's {{going to be a little}} more raw, a little bit more in your face, not a lot of relationship stuff," [...] he says, noting that fans would get a preview of a couple of the tracks, [...] "Wipe That Smile Off Your Face" [...] and [...] "Walking In Circles", on the current tour. [...] "My head, with what's going on in the world and being able to reflect on all the (stuff) that I've done in the last few years in terms of going to Iraq, working very closely with War Child, I'm in that mode. I'm not angry, but kind of frustrated." [...] After observing the plight in Sudan and Darfur, Maida returned with a different outlook on his lyrics and became more outspoken. “There were some [...] that were way too over the top and preachy,” he admits, “and I had to pull a lot of stuff back. This isn’t a solo record for me, this is Our Lady Peace, so I have three people that I contend with in terms of how far I can go with saying things.” Bassist Coutts added [...] "A lot of things he was talking about lyrically were things that we discussed as a band in spending all that time together. I also think that becoming a father also let him deal with issues that he hadn't dealt with before. Although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the darkest lyrics ever on this record, I think there are also some very positive ones as well." [...] The content of the album's lyrics have led it to be classified as a politically charged album, which the band hasn't denied.|$|E

[...] About.com gave the album four stars out of five, saying [...] "Corgan has claimed that friends who had heard Oceania had claimed it was his best since Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. Time will tell, but for now it's clear that Oceania is the first Smashing Pumpkins record since then to fully stimulate the senses and stir the heart." [...] Allmusic gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, saying [...] "On Oceania <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the most memorable and rousing songs Corgan has delivered since 1993's Siamese Dream". ARTISTdirect gave the album a five out of five stars, saying [...] "Oceania is the year's best rock record and a milestone for the genre. Hopefully, it incites and inspires a new generation. The Pumpkins are no strangers to that concept..." [...] Ology gave the album a B+, stating it is [...] "...simply a really good new album, one that deserves to be referenced and included in the company of the classic Smashing Pumpkins albums it delightfully demonstrates little interest in resembling." [...] The Chicago Sun-Times gave the album four out of four stars, saying [...] "this album within an album revives Corgan's gutter-epic vision with a clarity and ferocity not seen since 1995's Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness." [...] Daily Express gave the album four out of fivestars, saying [...] "Oceania [...] is Corgan on especially potent form". Sputnikmusic gave the album four out of fivestars, saying [...] "SP have forged ahead to create a record that could well be the catalyst of a stellar second era for one of rock's more interesting groups".|$|E
