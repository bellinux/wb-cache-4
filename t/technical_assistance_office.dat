40|$|IntroductionAlthough {{tobacco control}} {{activity}} in the United States {{during the past several}} years has increased dramatically, tobacco use continues to have devastating consequences among all age cohorts. MethodsIn November 2003, a survey of tobacco control practices and policies in health insurance plans was conducted by America's Health Insurance Plans' national <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>office.</b> The survey was the fourth and final survey conducted as part of the Addressing Tobacco in Managed Care program. Of the 215 plans in the sample, 160 (74 %) completed the survey. Collectively, these plans represent more than 60 million members of health maintenance organizations. ResultsFrom 1997 to 2003, health insurance plans have demonstrated increasing use of evidence-based programs and clinical guidelines to address tobacco use. The number of plans providing full coverage for any type of pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation has more than tripled since 1997. Plans have also shown substantial improvement in their ability to identify all or some of their members who smoke. Similarly, a greater percentage of plans are using strategies to address smoking cessation during treatment for other chronic diseases and after acute events such as a myocardial infarction. ConclusionDespite improvements, important opportunities remain for health insurance plans and other stakeholders to expand their tobacco control activities and transfer the lessons learned to other health problems...|$|E

The health and cost consequences of tobacco dependence have made treatment and prevention of tobacco use a key priority among multiple stakeholders, including health plans, insurers, providers, employers, and policymakers. In 2002, the third survey of tobacco control practices and policies in health plans was conducted by Americas Health Insurance Plans <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>office</b> {{as part of the}} Addressing Tobacco in Managed Care (ATMC) program. Methods The ATMC survey was conducted in the spring of 2002 via mail, e-mail, and fax. A 19 -item survey instrument was developed and pilot-tested. Of the 19 items, 12 were the same as in previous years, four were modified to collect more detailed data on areas of key interest, and three were added to gain information about strategies to promote smoking cessation. The sample for the survey was drawn from the 687 plans listed in the national directory of member and nonmember health plans in America's Health Insurance Plans. Results Of the 246 plans in the sample, 152 plans (62 %) representing more than 43. 5 million health maintenance organization members completed the survey. Results show that health plans are using evidence-based programs and clinical guidelines to address tobacco use. Compared to ATMC survey data collected in 1997 and 2000, the 2002 ATMC survey results indicate that more health plans are providing full coverage for first-line pharmacotherapies and telephone counseling for smoking cessation. Plans have also shown improvement in their ability to identify at least some members who smoke. Similarly, a greater percentage of plans are employing strategies to address smoking cessation during the postpartum period to prevent smoking relapse and during pediatric visits to reduce or eliminate childrens exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Conclusion The results of the 2002 ATMC survey reflect both tremendous accomplishments and important opportunities for health plans to collaborate in tobacco control efforts. With appropriate support, analytical tools, and resources, it is likely that health plans, clinicians, providers, and consumers will continue to evolve in their efforts to reduce the negative consequences of tobacco use...|$|E

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses the results of GAO's review of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> and capacity-building programs. <b>Technical</b> <b>assistance</b> programs {{can be defined as}} training designed to improve the performance or management of program recipients, such as teaching one-on-one procurement regulations to housing authority staff. Capacity building can be generally defined as funding to strengthen the capacity or capability of program recipients or providers [...] typically housing or community development organizations [...] thereby building the institutional knowledge within those organizations. The overall goal of both <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> and capacity building is to enhance the delivery of HUD's housing and community development programs. HUD administers 21 <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> programs through five program offices. From fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2002, the annual funding for HUD <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> ranged between $ 128 million and $ 201 million, accounting for less than 1 percent of HUD's overall budget each year. Although the general purpose of HUD's <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> is to help program participants carry out HUD program goals, each program <b>office</b> designs <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> specifically related to its programs. Recipients could be states and units of local government, public or Indian housing agencies, private and nonprofit organizations, or individuals. Providers could be HUD officials or, more commonly, state or local governments, profit and nonprofit organizations, or public housing agencies. HUD awards funding for 17 of the 21 <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> programs competitively. The funding for the remaining programs is awarded noncompetitively. HUD uses three types of funding instruments and determines which type to use {{on the basis of its}} relationship with the awardee and the level of federal involvement anticipated. All five HUD program offices perform basic oversight of the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> they administer, such as visually observing the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> or reviewing reports submitted by the providers to ensure that the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> was provided. In addition, some program offices also have impact measures in place.
