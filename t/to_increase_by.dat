5|$|For the 2014 season, Busch Gardens Tampa {{expected}} attendance <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>by</b> {{three to}} eight percent. However (as predicted in June 2014 by IBISWorld Research), combined attendance {{for the second}} quarter of the year increased by about 0.3 percent for SeaWorld Orlando, SeaWorld San Diego, SeaWorld San Antonio, Busch Gardens Williamsburg and Busch Gardens Tampa. Compared to the same period in 2013, combined attendance {{for the first half of}} the year dropped by just over four percent. Busch Gardens Tampa blamed the lack of its anticipated attendance increase partially on the Falcon's Fury delays.|$|E

5|$|The event grossed over US$375,000 in {{ticket sales}} from an {{attendance}} of 8,000, and received about 233,000pay-per-view buys, {{the same amount}} as the following year's event. This enabled WWE's pay-per-view revenue <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>by</b> $4.7million from the previous year. When the 2005 event was released on DVD, it reached a peak position of second on Billboards DVD Sales Chart.

5|$|Additionally, the {{population}} of Downtown Miami nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010, and is expected <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>by</b> several thousand more in the current decade, largely due to many new high rise condo developments {{in the downtown area}} adding thousands of housing units which will benefit from having the tunnel. Although traffic and port activity has declined since the early 90's, losing some of it to the nearby Port Everglades, which overtook Port of Miami in 2007 as Florida's largest cargo port, the port is likely to see a large shift in the other direction after it becomes one of few deep water ports in the United States able to handle the New Panamax ships by 2016. Within the first month of opening, it was reported that congestion in the downtown area had eased.|$|E
5|$|To {{adapt the}} dogs to the {{confines}} of the tiny cabin of Sputnik 2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods of up to 20 days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their general condition to deteriorate. Laxatives did not improve their condition, and the researchers found that only long periods of training proved effective. The dogs were placed in centrifuges that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their blood pressure <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>by</b> 30–65 torr. The dogs were trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.|$|E
