40|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> {{isotropic}} visual {{elements such}} as blobs and interest points, e. g.

5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most of}} their area forming the wing membrane. The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future veins, in which the nerves and tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding the veins becomes thickened and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Two types of hair may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to veins. <b>The</b> <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} how <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation in risk-adjustment models for health-care costs affects the covariate effect, where <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> interest for <b>the</b> covariate effect {{may be different}} from <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation. As an illustrative example, we use claims data to estimate the incremental costs associated with heart failure within one year subsequent to myocardial infarction. Here, <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> interest for <b>the</b> effect of heart failure on costs is additive. However, traditional methods for modeling costs use predetermined <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation - for example, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression assumes an additive scale while log-transformed OLS and generalized linear models with log-link assume a multiplicative <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation. We compare these models with a new flexible model that lets the data determine <b>the</b> appropriate <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation. We {{use a variety of}} goodness-of-fit measures along with a modified Copas test to assess robustness, lack of fit, and over-fitting properties of the alternative estimators. Biases up to 19 % in <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> interest are observed due to <b>the</b> misrepresentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation. <b>The</b> new flexible model is found to appropriately represent <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation and less susceptible to over-fitting despite estimating additional parameters in the link and the variance functions.

5|$|Fruit body {{primordia}} first appear between <b>the</b> <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> the cones, {{and require}} 9 to 35 days {{to reach their}} final height. They consist of an inner core of thin-walled generative hyphae enclosed by an outer coat of skeletal hyphae. Immature fruit bodies are white and delicate, but gradually become brown as they mature. Because the cap is grown from the stem tip after it bends, cap development interrupts stem growth, and this shift to centrifugal growth (that is, growth outward from the stem) results in the typical kidney-shaped or semicircular cap. Although the fruit body takes at least 9 days to mature, spores production begins within 48–72 hours of the start of cap growth. Spines start out as minute protuberances {{on the part of}} the stem adjoining the undersurface of the cap. As the cap enlarges, these spines are spread horizontally, and more protuberances are formed, which elongate vertically downwards.|$|E
5|$|In {{animals such as}} on the {{feathers}} of birds and <b>the</b> <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> butterflies, interference is created by a range of photonic mechanisms, including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres, matrices of nanochannels and proteins that can vary their configuration. Some cuts of meat also show structural coloration due to the exposure of the periodic arrangement of the muscular fibres. Many of these photonic mechanisms correspond to elaborate structures visible by electron microscopy. In the few plants that exploit structural coloration, brilliant colours are produced by structures within cells. The most brilliant blue coloration known in any living tissue {{is found in the}} marble berries of Pollia condensata, where a spiral structure of cellulose fibrils produces Bragg's law scattering of light. The bright gloss of buttercups is produced by thin-film reflection by the epidermis supplemented by yellow pigmentation, and strong diffuse scattering by a layer of starch cells immediately beneath.|$|E
5|$|In general, A.subrubescens can be {{distinguished}} from other Albatrellus species by its white cap that becomes orange when bruised, its simple-septate hyphae, small amyloid spores, and habitat under pines. In the field, Albatrellus ovinus is difficult to differentiate from A.subrubescens due to its similar appearance. A.ovinus usually lacks the violet color often seen in the cap and stem of A.subrubescens. Microscopic characteristics {{can be used to}} reliably distinguish the two species: the spores of A.subrubescens are amyloid, in contrast to those of A.ovinus, and A.ovinus spores are smaller, typically 3.8–4.6 by 3.3–3.5µm. Other similar species include A.tianschanicus, described from the Altai Mountains in East-Central Asia, and the Japanese species A.cantharellus. Unlike A.subrubescens, these species have hairy scales on the surface of their caps, and the scales are darker than the spaces between the scales. Also, <b>the</b> <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> A.subrubescens are not much darker than the area between the scales. Both of these Asian species have larger spores than A.subrubescens: those of A.cantharellus are 4.5–7 by 4–5.5µm, while those of A.tianschanicus are 5–7 by 4–5µm.|$|E

40|$|Growth {{models of}} the second {{generation}} type, e. g. the Jones (1995) or Young (1998) model, all exhibit a so called weak scale effect in per capita production, i. e. larger economies should have a higher per capita production than smaller economies. However, in an open economy context <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy is less important because countries can participate in <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> other countries through trade. This paper develops a simple open economy growth model of the second generation type which shows <b>the</b> relevance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trading partners for per capita production.

5|$|The {{body of the}} Portuguese dogfish {{is thick}} and {{cylindrical}} except for the flattened belly. The two dorsal fins are small and of similar size and shape, each bearing a tiny grooved spine in front. The first dorsal fin originates well behind the pectoral fins, while the second dorsal originates over {{the middle of the}} pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are medium-sized with a rounded margin. There is no anal fin. The caudal fin has a short but well-developed lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The very large dermal denticles change in shape with age: in juveniles, they are widely spaced and heart-shaped with an incomplete midline ridge and three posterior points, while in adults they are overlapping, roughly circular, smooth, and flattened with a round central concavity, superficially resembling <b>the</b> <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> bony fishes. Young sharks are a uniform blue-black in color, while adults are brown-black; there are no prominent fin markings.

25|$|Nopcsa {{theorized that}} {{increasing}} {{the surface area}} of the outstretched arms could have helped small cursorial predators keep their balance, and that <b>the</b> <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> the forearms elongated, evolving into feathers. The feathers could also {{have been used to}} trap insects or other prey. Progressively, the animals leapt for longer distances, helped by their evolving wings. Nopcsa also proposed three stages in the evolution of flight. First, animals developed passive flight, in which developing wing structures served as a sort of parachute. Second, they achieved active flight by flapping the wings. He used Archaeopteryx as an example of this second stage. Finally, birds gained the ability to soar.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of <b>the</b> <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> Platecarpus {{may have been}} another adaptation toward a marine lifestyle. The small size and similar shape of these scales throughout the body would have stiffened the trunk, making it more resistant to lateral movement. This stiffness would have improved hydrodynamic efficiency by improving {{the flow of water}} across the body. The early mosasauroid Vallecillosaurus also preserves body scales, but they are larger and more varied in shape, suggesting that the animal relied on undulatory movement in its trunk rather than just its tail. Plotosaurus, a more derived mosasaur than Platecarpus, has even smaller scales covering its body, indicating that it had even more efficient locomotion in the water.|$|E
