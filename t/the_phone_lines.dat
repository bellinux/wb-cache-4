5|$|Communications {{with the}} outside world went through a single Forest Service line until April 1943, when it was {{replaced}} by five Army telephone lines. This was increased to eight in March 1945. There were also three teletypewriters with encoding machines. The first was installed in March 1943, and two more were added in May 1943. One was removed in November 1945. There were telephones in the offices, but none in private residences, as the Army regarded this as a security hazard. There were some public phones in the township for emergencies. Since {{there was no way to}} prevent the lines being tapped, classified information could not be discussed over <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines.</b> Initially <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> were operable only during business hours until enough WACs arrived to man the switchboard around the clock.|$|E
5|$|As a {{birthday}} gift for Marge, Homer buys a blender designed by television chef Paula Paul. He {{goes to a}} health food store called Swapper Jack's, where Paula is giving away autographs, to have Paula sign it. Homer is impressed by the store and {{says he will not}} be shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart any more. Apu, who is there to spy, overhears Homer and the two engage in a fight until the security guards grab hold of Apu and take him away. At the signing, Homer tells Paula that Marge is a big fan of hers. Paula decides that she will call Marge live during her upcoming show to wish her a happy birthday. Meanwhile, Bart gets his mother a rabbit for her birthday. The rabbit chews through <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> in the Simpsons' home, causing Marge to miss Paula's call. Paula becomes furious at Marge for not answering the phone as she embarrassed herself on her show. Homer punishes Bart by locking him up in the rabbit's cage.|$|E
5|$|Annoyed {{that none}} of his {{co-workers}} {{paid attention to the}} fire safety seminar he gave last week, Dwight (Rainn Wilson) tries another approach by sealing the office exits shut, cutting <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> and starting a fire in a trash can. Dwight calmly explains the proper safety procedures as the panicked employees try to flee, smashing windows, crawling through air ducts and destroying office equipment. Dwight eventually reveals it was just a drill, but Stanley (Leslie David Baker) suffers a heart attack and collapses in the commotion. Dwight is subsequently censured by Dunder Mifflin CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley), and Michael (Steve Carell) strips him of his position as safety officer. After Stanley is released from the hospital, his doctors warn him to keep his stress levels under control to avoid further damaging his health. Michael arranges for a CPR training session for the employees, but they are too easily distracted and the lesson proves fruitless. The session ends badly when Dwight destroys the expensive CPR dummy, earning another rebuke from David Wallace. Dwight is ordered to apologize to his co-workers and get signatures acknowledging that they forgive him, but after he openly declares that his apology is insincere and denies that he is responsible for Stanley's heart attack, they refuse to sign.|$|E
50|$|Some {{customers}} have the misconception that <b>the</b> optional <b>phone</b> <b>line,</b> when {{plugged into the}} receiver, is used for software downloads and programming changes. In fact, the only information the line receives, if available from and supported by <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>line,</b> consists of caller ID informations displayed in a pop-up notification for the viewer's convenience when a phone call is being received. <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>line</b> simply automates <b>the</b> process of ordering pay-per-view by dialing out the Event ID and other information that would be requested by manually calling <b>the</b> pay-per-view <b>phone</b> system.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Carrier tone== A carrier tone is {{an audio}} carrier signal used by two modems to {{suppress}} echo cancellation {{and establish a}} baseline frequency for communication. When the answering modem detects a ringtone on <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>line,</b> it picks up that line and starts transmitting a carrier tone. If it does not receive data from the calling modem within a set amount of time, it disconnects the line. The calling modem waits for the tone after it dials <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>line</b> before it initiates data transmission. If it does not receive a carrier tone within a set amount of time, it will disconnect <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>line</b> and issues <b>the</b> NO CARRIER message.|$|R

25|$|During the evening, more union {{supporters}} stole {{guns and}} ammunition, {{and made their}} way to the strip mine. McDowell was to have called Hunter when the truce took effect. When he, Col. Hunter tried to telephone the mine, he found <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> had been cut. No law enforcement officers went to the mine, no government officials accompanied Hughes to ensure the white flags were raised, and no troops were activated by the National Guard despite repeated signs that Thaxton could not be counted on to act. No action was taken to enforce a truce.|$|E
25|$|The Exhibits Design and Production Laboratory, {{located at}} Fort Stanton, was opened in October 1974. It was there where {{preparations}} {{for a new}} museum building took place. In 1976, it suffered a fire after masonite sheets fell from a forklift, and into a container of lacquer thinner. Staff were unable {{to call for help}} due to the fire damaging <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines.</b> The damage cost approximately $75,000 and no one was injured. The museum became the first Smithsonian museum to use labels for the hearing impaired in their exhibitions, in 1980. An archives devoted to the area of Anacostia was created in 1977.|$|E

25|$|The first résistant {{executed}} by the Germans was a Polish Jewish immigrant named Israël Carp, shot in Bordeaux on 28 August 1940 for jeering a German military parade down the streets of Bordeaux. The first Frenchman shot for resistance was the 19 year-old Pierre Roche, who was shot on 7 September 1940 after he was caught cutting <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> between Royan and La Rochelle. On 10 September 1940, the military governor of France, General Otto von Stülpnagel announced in a press statement that no mercy would be granted to those engaging in sabotage and all saboteurs would be shot. Despite his warning, more continued to engage in sabotage. Louis Lallier, a farmer was shot for sabotage on 11 September in Epinal and Marcel Rossier, a mechanic was shot in Rennes on 12 September. One more was shot in October 1940, and three more in November 1940.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} two series, acts usually chose a cover of a pop {{standard}} or contemporary hit. In series 1, much {{was made of the}} idea that each performer/mentor combination was free to present the performance however they wanted, including performer playing live instruments, or the addition of choirs, backing bands, and dancers. From the third series, each live show has had a different theme; each contestant's song is chosen according to the theme. A celebrity guest connected to the theme is often invited onto the show, and clips are shown of the guest conversing with the contestants at rehearsal. After each act has performed, the judges comment on their performance. Heated disagreements, usually involving judges defending their contestants against criticism, are a regular feature of the show. Once all the acts have appeared, <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> open and the viewing public vote on which act they want to keep.|$|E
25|$|At the hospital, {{paramedic}} Jimmy (Lance Guest) develops romantic {{feelings for}} Laurie, {{much to the}} chagrin of head nurse Mrs. Alves (Gloria Gifford). Michael discovers Laurie's location via the radio, due to the event reaching the media, and makes his way to the hospital. Once there, he cuts <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines,</b> disables the cars, and kills the hospital personnel. Security guard Mr. Garrett goes downstairs to fix the power in the basement and is killed with a hammer claw to his skull. Paramedic Budd is strangled while Nurse Karen is drowned in a hot tub. Orderly Janet hurries off to find Dr. Mixter only to find him dead with a needle jammed into his eye. Before she can flee, Michael kills her with a syringe. Jimmy and Nurse Jill Franco (Tawny Moyer) search the hospital for Laurie, who is trying to evade Michael; Jimmy finds Mrs. Alves' corpse and slips {{in a pool of blood}} on the floor, losing consciousness.|$|E

500|$|However, the {{telephone}} line network which the Meganet ran on {{has been criticized}} for its logistical issues in online gaming. [...] According to Electronic Gaming Monthly, [...] "Even though the TeleGenesis modem has been announced, it has yet to appear and the real usefulness of a device that is used only to play games with friends over <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> remains questionable (both have to have the modem, <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> must be clear, the phone bills will be a problem if it’s a long-distance call, etc.)" [...] The same issues that plagued the Meganet over the use of phone lines for Internet connectivity would later resurface when Catapult Entertainment launched the XBAND service in 1994.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, tickets {{sold out}} within 24 hours amid much {{controversy}} over the ticket ordering process, which left potential festival goers trying for hours to connect to the overloaded telephone and internet sites. [...] The website got two million attempted connections within the first five minutes of the tickets going on sale and an average of 2,500 people on <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> every minute. [...] The festival was not hit by extreme weather, but high winds on the Wednesday delayed entry, and steady rain throughout Saturday turned {{some areas of the}} site to mud. [...] The festival ended with Muse headlining the Pyramid Stage on Sunday, after Oasis had headlined on Friday. Franz Ferdinand and Sir Paul McCartney also performed. In the British press publications appeared about the use of psychedelic drugs by festival visitors. The magazine NME pronounced that 2004 would be [...] "the third summer of love" [...] due to the resurgence of the [...] "shroom" [...] that was praised as a natural alternative to ecstasy, which was said to be declining in popularity (LSD fuelled the first summer of love in 1967; ecstasy and LSD the second in 1988).|$|E
500|$|As Homer and Bart are {{watching}} The Itchy & Scratchy Show, Marge tells {{them that the}} telephone company has charged the family hundreds of dollars for making phone calls to Brazil. Homer and Marge decide to visit the company, thinking {{there has been a}} mistake. They meet with customer service representative Lindsey Naegle, who cuts off the family's phone service after Homer tells her that he refuses to pay the bill. Homer attempts to connect illegally to <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines,</b> but only succeeds in getting electrocuted at least 5 times and, when he regains consciousness on the couch, is told that he was found [...] "smoldering in the bushes". When Lisa finds out the reason the family no longer has phone service, she confesses that she has actually made calls to Brazil. She has been sponsoring an orphan named Ronaldo in the country and she used to receive a letter from him once every month until recently. Lisa called Ronaldo's orphanage to find out what had happened and she was told he is missing. She shows her family a tape recorded by Ronaldo that she received after her first donation, in which Ronaldo thanks Lisa and tells her that with her money he has purchased a pair of dancing shoes for himself and the orphanage has been able to buy a door. Touched by the tape, the Simpsons decide to travel to Brazil to solve the mystery behind Ronaldo's disappearance, leaving Maggie with Patty and Selma.|$|E

500|$|Despite the evacuations, Nina's closest {{approach}} to Hawaii was 120miles away. However, it came {{close enough to}} bring winds and heavy rain to the islands. There were four deaths reported in connection to the storm. The first reported was on Oahu when Herman Palepana, a lineman in the Honolulu street department, was killed when he was electrocuted by a power line downed during Nina's passing. Soon after, a sampan called the Setsu Maru sent a distress call reporting that the boat was sinking 10miles east of Niihau. Even though the Navy sent the submarine rescue vessel Couchal and conducted an air-seas search for the vessel, {{no trace of the}} sampan or the wreckage had been found. All three people aboard the boat were reported dead as a result. Another person in Hanapepe was injured when a tree came through a window in his house, causing minor forehead cuts. <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>lines</b> to the county seat of Kauai County, Lihue, were broken during the hurricane. The Aloha Theater in Hanapepe had been flooded by up to three feet of water. Reports from the five major islands indicated that less than 50 homes had been damaged during the storm and roughly 12 of them being destroyed on Kauai alone. Another ship disaster occurred when the Greek freighter Margarita Chandris got caught in the storm's winds while heading to Honolulu from Kobe. A distress call from the ship described the ship as [...] "out of control". The initial fears were that the winds from Nina would pull the ship closer to its center. These fears were made worse when the ship was found to be cargoless, making it easier to be moved by the waves. A later call said that the crew was unable to steer the ship. Three ships, the Rainier, the United States Coast Guard cutter Winnebago and the cargoliner President Monroe, were sent out to find and guide the Chandris to port. The Monroe finally found the freighter and guided it toward land until the Winnebago caught up. The cutter finally caught up to the Margarita Chandris and relieved the President Monroe and started planning to board and make repairs. Afterward, it was decided that the Margarita Chandris had enough fuel to drift into Honolulu alone. Nina's proximity also caused heavy rains, with 20.42inches falling in Wainiha in 14hours. Overall, Hurricane Nina was responsible for $100,000 in damages (1957USD), mostly from heavy surf, some of which measured 35feet high.|$|E

50|$|In the powered version, Pins 2 and 5 (black and yellow) {{may carry}} low voltage AC or DC power.

Typically, the power on Pins 2 and 5 comes from a transformer plugged into a wall near one jack, supplying power {{to all of the}} jacks in the house.
