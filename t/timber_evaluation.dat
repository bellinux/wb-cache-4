40|$|Abstract—Cross-laminated timber is {{increasingly}} {{being used in}} the construction of high-rise buildings due to its simple manufacturing system. In term of fire resistance, cross-laminated timber panels are promoted as having excellent fire resistance, comparable to that of non-combustible materials and to heavy timber construction, due to the ability of thick wood assemblies to char slowly at a predictable rate while maintaining most of their strength during the fire exposure. This paper presents an overview of fire performance of cross-laminated <b>timber</b> and <b>evaluation</b> of its resistance to elevated temperature in comparison to homogeneous timber panels. Charring rates for cross-laminated timber panels of those obtained experimentally were compared with those provided by Eurocode simplified calculation methods.

30|$|Regarding the LCA and CF, it is {{imperative}} to answer the question of how long an evaluation period should be postulated. While the evaluation period was set to be 50  years in the previous study [8], as that is the service life of <b>timber</b> dams, <b>evaluation</b> results on carbon balance vary if a period shorter or longer than the 50  year evaluation period is considered. Brandão et al. [12] mentioned that using a different evaluation period can significantly change the evaluation results on the carbon balance of wood in the LCA and CF. Therefore, in this study the evaluation period was set to be a maximum of 100  years, and then an examination was done to determine how using different evaluation periods (e.g., 30, 50, and 100  years) would affect the results.|$|R
40|$|Form {{factors are}} often used for stem timber volume {{estimation}} at both tree and forest stand levels. But this estimation becomes easy and faster when for each species is established a table where are ordered these factors according to the trees height. This contribution proposes such table for Aleppo pine reforestation realized in 1890 {{in the region of}} Tlemcen (West of Algeria). The method used for its establishment uses advantageously the existing relation between natural and artificial (breast-height) factors and requires a limited number sample trees (50 to 80 only). The obtained values, from 0540 to 0356 for respectively 6 to 25 meters heights, express better taper of the stems in the study stand and allow practically quick stem <b>timber</b> volume <b>evaluation</b> in our survey zone or in other similar stations...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{uniaxial}} cyclic loading tests {{have been carried}} out on two types of punched metal plate timber fasteners to investigate and establish their failure criterion, provide a better understanding of their mechanism of failure and set a firm basis for optimum design of these types of joint. The mode of failure was found to be somehow different for different types of joint, whereas the initial slip values were found to be the same for both joints. Slip remained constant for one type of joint and increased with increasing number of cycles for the other type. The strain distribution across the steel plate was found to be maximum at the centre and minimum at the edges. It was concluded that present methods and procedures for punched metal plate <b>timber</b> fastener <b>evaluation</b> and design are not entirely integral and require further tests combined with rigorous analytical work...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} GPR {{technique}} for <b>timber</b> structures <b>evaluation.</b> According to the electromagnetic (EM) theory, GPR wave's propagation is governed by the EM properties of a dielectric material as wood, which is affected by various parameters such as moisture, as well as heterogeneities. This paper presents some laboratory measurements in the aim of studying the sensitivity of electromagnetic waves to moisture variation in wood material. Dielectric relative permittivity was measured using resonance technique at 1. 26 GHz for Spruce and Pine wood samples. GPR measurements were also carried out using GSSI SIR 3000 system connected to 1. 5 GHz antennas on several wood samples. The results of this study show the good relations between real/imaginary relative permittivity and moisture content of the different wood samples. Moreover, due to the dependence of wood permittivity to moisture, GPR features in time domains present some correlations with moisture content of wood material...|$|R

To achieve and protect sustainable development of boreal forests {{there is a need}} to arrange monitoring of boreal forests conditions. Its goal is to establish the scientific rationale for the required protection level, conservation and regeneration of boreal forests, and their use level. A new synthetic approach to sustainable development of the regional <b>timber</b> cluster <b>evaluation</b> (the Komi republic) is worked out, it considers the system integrity. A new methodology of sustainable development level calculation is introduced; it is based on a synthetic model of the timber cluster duality: forestry ? forest use and basic public relationship indicators. Conditions, opportunities and limits of sustainable development of boreal forests are considered. Methodical and practical schemes of sustainable regional <b>timber</b> cluster development <b>evaluation</b> are approved. Possible mechanisms of results use in the regional forest sector management practice are described, as well as sustainable development planning at the regional and company level.

The X-ray calibration procedure showed a very good agreement between the measured density and the grayscale from X-ray images and indicates a good opportunity for developing {{a useful tool for}} the overall assessment of timber structures. The correlation coefficients (R 2) range from 0. 90 - 0. 98. There can also be detected a clear tendency between the influence of different moisture conditions and the grayscale from X-ray images. This influence must be therefore concluded in the evaluation process as well as the influence of the thickness of the timber specimen. The density calibration method was verified on wood specimens with highly acceptable results and an average accuracy of 97 %. Besides the possibility of determining mechanical properties of timber, the main advantage over conventional techniques is the detection and quantification of internal damage, defects and deterioration that reduce the mechanical properties of the structure...|$|R

40|$|The {{critical}} {{deterioration of}} bridges nationwide has initiated {{the search for}} new methods to rehabilitate, repair, manage, and construct bridges. Consequently, smart structure concepts utilizing structural health monitoring strategies have emerged to help improve future bridge management. However, in the specific case of timber bridges, {{a limited amount of}} research has been conducted on long-term structural health monitoring solutions. To date, <b>timber</b> bridge <b>evaluation</b> efforts have focus primarily on visual inspection data to determine the structural integrity of timber structures. To improve current timber bridge inspection and management strategies, a five-year research plan to develop a smart timber bridge structure was undertaken. The overall goal is to develop a turn-key system to analyze, monitor, and report on the performance and condition of timber bridges. This paper outlines two of the multiple phases in the five-year research plan. One phase focusses on developing, embedding, and attaching both strain and moisture sensors into glued-laminated (glulam) timber components. The other phase addresses data processing techniques to determine structural stiffness changes in timber bridges. From this work, the following contributions were added {{to the development of the}} smart timber bridge. * A commercially available timber moisture sensor was selected for the smart timber bridge due its reasonable accuracy, survivability under repeated loading, and ability to be wired in to a complete data logging system. * Two methods for embedding and attaching strain sensors into glulam girders were developed, tested, and successfully integrated into the glulam fabrication process. * A data processing technique to evaluate structural stiffness parameters was successfully developed and implemented on an existing timber bridge. The timber specific sensors and data processing techniques described herein collectively advance the development of the smart timber bridge. Upon completing the ongoing research plan, timber bridge owners will be provided with useful information regarding the performance and condition of their structure. As a result, owners will be able to program routine maintenance and/or rehabilitation in a more timely fashion...|$|R

Pri žaganem lesu ocenjevanje temelji na vizualnih karakteristikah lesa in lesenih izdelkov. Obstajajo določeni standardi za razvrščanje posameznega elementa v kakovostni razred, vendar je to področje še vedno precej neenotno. V okviru te diplomske naloge želimo določiti preprost algoritem za ocenitev natezne trdnosti bukovih desk. Ocena temelji na vizualnih karakteristikah bukovine. Najprej je v grobem opisan les kot {{material}} in njegove lastnosti ter določene vizualne značilnosti bukovine, ki naj bi najbolj vplivale na mehanske lastnosti in natezno trdnost lesa. V nadaljevanju analiziramo štiri različne tipe porušitve po ploskvi deske in dva tipa porušitve po robu deske, ki jih definiramo na podlagi eksperimentalnih opažanj. Nadalje poskušamo določiti, katere vizualne karakteristike so značilne za posamezen tip porušitve, in nato na podlagi rezultatov nateznih testov označiti, v kakšen razred nateznih trdnosti spada posamezen tip porušitve oziroma kombinacija porušitve po robu in po ploskvi deske.

In {{the first part of the}} thesis, we briefly describe wood as a material and present its features as well as certain visual characteristics of beech wood that are most likely to influence the mechanical properties and the ultimate tensile strength of wood. In the following chapters, we analyse four different types of fracture on the surface of the board and two types of fracture on the edge of the board. These types of fracture are defined according to our experimental observations. Furthermore, we try to determine which visual characteristics are typical for each type of fracture. On the basis of the results of tensile tests, we try to determine the level of the ultimate tensile strength for each type of fracture or the combination of fractures on the edge and on the surface of the board...|$|R
40|$|Since two decades, {{the use of}} {{terrestrial}} laser scanning (TLS) and Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) has become very prominent in analysing 3 D forest structures (AKAY et al. 2009). The potential of full waveform analysis of high density Airborne LiDAR data (ALS) for the detection and structural analysis of multi-layered forest stands is not yet well investigated (JASKIERNIAK et al. 2011), although ALS data provide exact information on tree heights of multi-layered forest stands using particular laser pulse characteristics (GAULTON & MALTHUS 2010). Since the mid- 19 th century, managed forests in Brandenburg have been dominated by Scots pine monocultures. In the last fifteen to twenty years many forest stands were converted into multi-layered mixed forests by silvicultural conversion of forests and natural succession (MLUR 2004). Today, the majority of forest stands in the federal state of Brandenburg remain dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in the canopy layer, while European beech (Fagus sylvatica) or Sessile oak (Quercus petraea) are predominant in the understorey. In this study, we investigate and discuss the potential of full waveform high density airborne LiDAR data (ALS) for detecting, classifying, and stratifying discrete vegetation layers at forest stand level, based on 0. 1 ha investigation plots. Full waveform high density ALS data on each 5 th percentile level was used in combination with binary logistic regressions to discover the structural layer type of multi-layered forest stands from normalized discrete ALS pulses. The results of the descriptive statistics of ALS point clouds and binary logistic regression models produce particular forest layer profile indices of understorey vegetation and canopy layer. Such parameters can further be used as variables for forest structure analysis algorithms, and can be empirically tested against stand characteristics. The validation of ALS data and model results is tested against empirical forest mensuration data of the “Datenspeicher Wald 2 (DSW 2 -Forest inventory data) ” and field survey reference points using error matrices. We demonstrate that binary logistic regression analyses are functional for establishing a prediction model. The model was applied successfully on larger forest stands and forest areas, and can become useful for identifying and separating single from multi-layered forest stands using percentiles of total amounts of ALS return pulses on a 10 x 10 m raster size with a high overall accuracy of 90 %. The established model {{has the potential for}} a broad range of forest management applications, such as <b>timber</b> inventory <b>evaluation,</b> forest growth modelling, monitoring of vegetation dynamic and succession, as well as ecological classifications and the detection of deadwood in forest stands (KIM et al. 2009) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2002 This study {{focuses on}} the {{tradeoffs}} that exist for managing forested landscapes for biodiversity and <b>timber</b> production. Tradeoff <b>evaluation</b> is important to natural resource managers so they can understand the benefits and costs of alternative management prescriptions. The study examines three watersheds in the Oregon Coast Range and 166 terrestrial vertebrate species to determine the productive capacity of the site in terms of biodiversity and timber revenue. Two points are identified that maximize biodiversity and maximize timber revenue that serve as corner solutions for the production possibilities frontier for biodiversity and timber revenue. The frontier identifies all combinations of outputs that are equal in productive efficiency and {{the slope of the}} frontier identifies the marginal cost of biodiversity in terms of foregone timber revenue. A special case is then examined that reenacts the proposed management intentions of each ownership group in the study area. The special case model is used to examine the level of efficiency that exists with respect to the productive possibilities frontier. The results of the study indicate that there is a high level of inefficiency in the proposed management intentions of the various ownership groups. Higher levels of revenues can be achieved at the same level of biodiversity. Conversely more biodiversity can be produced at the same level of revenue. Marginal cost analysis also showed that biodiversity comes at an increasingly high cost at the extreme end of the productive capability of the study area. Results also indicate the species that are most affected by management activities are those that require large home ranges (> 200 acres) and species that are the most taxonomically unique...|$|R
