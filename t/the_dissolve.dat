500|$|A form of {{cinematic}} punctuation {{very strongly}} identified with Kurosawa is the wipe. This is an effect created through an optical printer, in which, when a scene ends, a line or bar appears to {{move across the}} screen, [...] "wiping" [...] away the image while simultaneously revealing the first image of the subsequent scene. As a transitional device, it {{is used as a}} substitute for the straight cut or <b>the</b> <b>dissolve</b> (though Kurosawa often used both of those devices as well). In his mature work, Kurosawa employed the wipe so frequently that it became a kind of signature. For example, one blogger has counted no fewer than 12 instances of the wipe in Drunken Angel. Kurosawa by all accounts always gave great attention to the soundtracks of his films, especially with an emphasis on sound-image counterpoint, in which the music or sound effects would ironically comment upon the image rather than merely reinforcing it. (Teruyo Nogami's memoir gives several such examples from Drunken Angel and Stray Dog.) He was also involved with several of Japan's outstanding contemporary composers, including Fumio Hayasaka (who died in 1955) and the internationally famous Toru Takemitsu.|$|E

[...] Chris Nashawaty, {{reviewing}} the film for Entertainment Weekly, called it [...] "the most feminist summer action flick in years".

500|$|Since its release, Memento {{has been}} a widely noted topic of film discussion, both for its unique {{narrative}} structure and themes. Those searching for explanations of the film's plot have either resorted to online forums, message boards or scholarly material, or have ignored the film's official website and forums {{in order to maintain}} their own personal hypotheses. In an article for <b>The</b> <b>Dissolve</b> analyzing Nolan's work, Mike D'Angelo cites Memento as [...] "a masterful study in deliberate self-delusion," [...] alluding to Leonard's own actions {{towards the end of the}} film and his role as an unreliable narrator. On the same topic of self-deception, James Mooney of filmandphilosophy.com notes that the film suggests how [...] "our memories deceive us, or rather, sometimes we deceive ourselves by ‘choosing’ to forget or by manipulating our memories of past events." [...] This is much in line with a psychological analysis of the film, specifically the act of confabulation. Leonard's use of confabulation poses the dilemma, as explained by SUNY Downstate Medical Center Professor John Kubie for BrainFacts.org: [...] "In Memento we are faced with the question of how much of Leonard's memory of the past is real and how much constructed from beliefs and wishes." ...|$|E

500|$|Alan Scherstuhl wrote a very {{critical}} piece for The Village Voice; {{he called the}} film predictable and repetitive, and said it contained several facts that have been clearly [...] "common knowledge for years". Scherstuhl said it is scattershot, [...] "a litany of Things We Can All Agree Are Bad", but ultimately jumps between several topicswithout sufficient detail, in his opinionbut comes to no conclusion or alternative. Scherstuhl said not even common people would have their beliefs challenged {{and that they would}} [...] "dismiss it as the vague liberal agitprop that it is". Similarly, while saying the film discusses important issues, both Genevieve Koski of <b>The</b> <b>Dissolve</b> and Jennie Kermode of Eye for Film said it deals with several themes quickly but does not expand upon any of them. Koski said, [...] "The True Cost is methodical to a fault", while Kermode said it is [...] "a good starting point" [...] on the topic. Fashion critic Vanessa Friedman said it has an [...] "easy-to-swallow accessibility" [...] but that it [...] "oversimplifies" [...] some aspects of the industry. In addition to commenting on the lack of attribution for [...] "lots of eye-popping statements", she said, [...] "trying to do everything, he skirted a lot of things". The Los Angeles Timess Martin Tsai criticized Morgan for interviewing his own executive producers, saying [...] "the effects of fertilizers...don't appear quite as tangible", and faulted Morgan for not exploring [...] "retailer markups that could have gone toward improving sweatshop conditions instead of profit margins", but appreciated that he had interviewed people with both pro and con views. Lizzie Crocker of The Daily Beast said Morgan had socialist views and that the film implies he wants {{to go back to the}} 1960s. She also criticized some interviewees, such as Miller, whom she called a [...] "conspiracy theorist", and Wolff, whom she called a [...] "Marxist idealist". Crocker was dismissive of the film, saying, [...] "the film loses focus and credibility, criticizing not just the fashion industry but the global capitalist system that supports it".|$|E
500|$|Although the eponymous Baker {{brothers}} are the default {{stars of the}} film, Susie {{is considered to be}} the film's [...] "centerpiece". Film critic Mike D'angelo, writing for <b>The</b> <b>Dissolve,</b> observed that [...] "the character's name is Susie Diamond, and she's written like a woman named Susie Diamond, and Pfeiffer plays her ... like a woman named Susie Diamond." [...] As a romantic film, The Fabulous Baker Boys focuses on [...] "the unfulfilled longing between" [...] bandmates Susie and Jack. Susie is the only woman capable of changing [...] "the aloof, uncommunicative Jack... by throwing incendiary tantrums and sounding even tougher than he does", slowly inspiring the pianist to change the person he has allowed himself to become. Rolling Stones Peter Travers believes that Susie and Jack bond because both characters are [...] "losers who've sold themselves on the cheap"; Jack is a skilled musician who despises himself for squandering his talent, which reminds former escort Susie of herself. Pfeiffer agreed that her character essentially becomes [...] "a mirror image for Jack" [...] although both remain very different individuals. While Jack is depicted as timid and cautious about his decisions, Susie rather [...] "embraces life" [...] instead. An adventurous individual, Susie refuses to do only one thing, including perform, for her entire life. Pfeiffer observed that although her character has spent a significant portion of her life as an escort, she remains less of a [...] "whore" [...] than Jack because she retains her individuality, while Jack [...] "has ceased to be a vital human being." [...] When Susie and Jack have their final argument, the profanity Jack uses actually helps establish Susie as the stronger character, according to Mark R. Hasan of KQEK.com. Susie's nicknames for her bandmates reveal exactly how she feels about both brothers individually; while she refers to Frank as [...] "Egghead" [...] because of his growing bald spot and tendency to act unintelligent at times, she calls Jack simply [...] "Baker" [...] because, in her opinion, [...] "there's really only one Baker brother and he's it." [...] The way Susie teases Frank is reminiscent of how Jack used to treat him several years before she joined the band when he had energy to do it.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Susie, dressed in a red evening dress, seductively {{performs}} [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] {{on top of a}} grand piano has since become iconic and often parodied, establishing itself as a modern cinema classic. As the film's most iconic scene, it quickly became [...] "the stuff of legend" [...] according to Creative Loafing's Matt Brunson. The Fabulous Baker Boys tends to be most remembered for this celebrated scene. The Guardians Jane Graham agreed that the film's title [...] "will immediately conjure up an image of a beautiful woman sliding her way across a grand piano", referring to Pfeiffer's performance as [...] "undoubtedly... the most memorable aspect" [...] of The Fabulous Baker Boys, rivaling performances by Marilyn Monroe. Vulture's Angelica Jade Bastién wrote that Pfeiffer elevates the scene [...] "to that small pantheon of definitive bombshell moments that strike with the force of a chemical reaction," [...] comparing it to Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe's performances in Gilda and Some Like It Hot, respectively. Additionally, Turner Classic Movies believes that [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] is largely responsible for Pfeiffer's Academy Award nomination. In 2000, Empire film critic Ian Nathan proclaimed that Pfeiffer's [...] "immaculate" [...] rendition of [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] had finally achieved [...] "classic" [...] status. Mike D'Angelo of <b>The</b> <b>Dissolve</b> likened the sequence's impact to those of other famous film performances and lines that [...] "are embodied in the cultural consciousness", such as [...] "You talkin' to me?" [...] from Taxi Driver (1976) and [...] "Get to the choppa!" [...] from Predator (1987), concluding, [...] "It's easy to forget ... that there was more to the movie—and to Pfeiffer's terrific work therein—than that one intensely erotic scene. InSing ranked the scene eighth on their [...] "30 sexiest scenes in movie history" [...] countdown. The Calgary Herald considers The Fabulous Baker Boys to be the ninth sexiest film of all-time largely due to [...] "Makin' Whoopee". Nerve ranked Pfeiffer the 33rd [...] "Greatest Female Sex Symbols in Film History", dubbing the actress' rendition of [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] "a play from a sex-symbol how-to guide." [...] After providing her own vocals in The Fabulous Baker Boys, Pfeiffer would eventually go on to sing in two more musical films, The Prince of Egypt (1998) and Hairspray (2007), earning positive reviews on each occasion.|$|E

500|$|Director and screenwriter Steve Kloves {{spent six}} months writing The Fabulous Baker Boys from the {{perspective}} of its three main characters, exploring their relationship with each other. Kloves eventually decided to write the film {{in the form of a}} character study, developing Susie into a [...] "feisty wild card looking for something more from her life." [...] Susie is portrayed by American actress Michelle Pfeiffer, who claims to have first been offered the role five years before production began, only to decline it on several occasions. Despite being one of the most sought-after actresses at the time due to her recent Academy Award-nominated performance in Dangerous Liaisons (1988), some studio executives feared that Pfeiffer was still too obscure to attract a large audience on her own. Having already known her personally, Pfeiffer became the first actor Kloves expressed interest in casting in The Fabulous Baker Boys; he eventually focused on casting real-life brothers Jeff and Beau Bridges as the eponymous Fabulous Baker Boys once establishing contact with Pfeiffer proved difficult. However, the script continued to struggle without an actress playing Susie. During this time, actress Debra Winger and singer Madonna were both considered for the role, the latter of whom turned it down because she felt the script was [...] "too mushy". Actresses Jodie Foster and Jennifer Jason Leigh had also expressed interest in the part, but Kloves was eventually able to contact Pfeiffer, maintaining that she is the only actress he himself had ever considered for the role. Although the actress enjoyed both the script and character, with whom she identified emotionally, she was hesitant to commit to another role so soon after having just recently completed several film projects in a row, initially intending to go on hiatus after filming Dangerous Liaisons due to exhaustion. Thus, Kloves spent one week visiting Pfeiffer at her home until she finally relented. Prior to The Fabulous Baker Boys, most of Pfeiffer's roles had been rather unglamorous; Pfeiffer claims that she typically avoided playing glamorous characters because she found most of them uninteresting until she discovered Susie. Pfeiffer accepted the role because she [...] "thought [...] was a great woman... someone I really wanted to be like." [...] Film critic Mike D'Angelo, writing for <b>The</b> <b>Dissolve,</b> believes that Pfeiffer decided to accept the role of Susie because she was still embarrassed by her performance in the unsuccessful musical Grease 2 (1982), and wanted to prove that she was in fact capable of playing a character who was a combination of both Sandy Olsson and Betty Rizzo from Grease (1978) at the same time.|$|E
2500|$|Some critics, however, {{provided}} negative reviews. Reviewing it for Vanity Fair, Richard Lawson {{called the}} film [...] "hoary" [...] and [...] "deceptively simple". Scott Tobias, writing for <b>The</b> <b>Dissolve,</b> gave the film 1.5 stars. He commends Lubezki's cinematography as succeeding at [...] "trapping viewers in a pressure-cooker atmosphere as Riggan and his players {{struggle to keep}} it together", but suggests that Iñárritu is [...] "incapable of modulation" [...] and that there exists [...] "a sourness to Birdman that Iñárritu can't turn into wit." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{technique}} of separating the 3D image {{has been called}} a new shot in filmmaking, although it is partially comparable to shots in the first 3D feature film The Power of Love. Calum Marsh of <b>The</b> <b>Dissolve</b> said that [...] "the vocabulary of the cinema has been enriched. There is a new tool available to filmmakers: a new technique, like the jump cut before it", and that in his previous films Godard has [...] "been searching for a way to unify ideas—to join disparate images to create a new one. This shot is the realization." [...] Erin Whitney of The Huffington Post wrote that [...] "The moment is so innovative and unusual that Godard and his cinematographer, Fabrice Aragno, didn't even have a name for it (Aragno has referred to the shot as [...] "separation," [...] {{for lack of a better}} term)." [...] David Ehrlich of <b>The</b> <b>Dissolve</b> has described the technique as a [...] "choose your own adventure" [...] shot and wrote that [...] "by rendering the disparate images separate but simultaneous, Godard has found a way for viewers to compare separate images at the moment they see them. Goodbye To Language effectively argues that every cut is porous, and that seeing is just looking, if it's distracted by memory." [...] Amy Taubin of Film Comment called the shot [...] "a mindboggling, eyeball-dislocating, narratively profound sequence" [...] and reported that after the shot concluded the audience erupted into applause at the film's premiere during the Cannes film festival. Jonathan Romney of Film Comment said that [...] "it's in-camera magic of a Méliès vintage: a piece of cheap trickery, but brilliantly and simply carried off, finding hitherto unsuspected delight in a simple 'improper' use of 3-D." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{striking}} {{fact about}} Ozu's late films (of which Late Spring {{is the first}} instance) is that transitions between scenes are accomplished exclusively through simple cuts. According to one commentator, the lost work, The Life of an Office Worker (Kaishain seikatsu, 1929), contained a dissolve, and several extant Ozu films of the 1930s (e.g., Tokyo Chorus and The Only Son) contain some fades. But {{by the time of}} Late Spring, these were completely eliminated, with only music cues to signal scene changes. (Ozu once spoke of the use of <b>the</b> <b>dissolve</b> as [...] "a form of cheating.") This self-restraint by the filmmaker is now seen as very modern, because although fades, dissolves and even wipes were all part of common cinematic grammar worldwide at the time of Late Spring (and long afterwards), such devices are often considered somewhat [...] "old fashioned" [...] today, when straight cuts are the norm.|$|E
