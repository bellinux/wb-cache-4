5|$|One month later, Jupiter {{visits the}} narrator and asks him to come immediately, fearing that Legrand has been bitten by <b>the</b> <b>bug</b> and gone insane. Once they arrive on the island, Legrand insists that <b>the</b> <b>bug</b> will {{be the key to}} {{restoring}} his lost fortune. He leads them on an expedition to a particular tree and has Jupiter climb it until he finds a skull nailed {{at the end of one}} branch. At Legrand's direction, Jupiter drops <b>the</b> <b>bug</b> through one eye socket and Legrand paces out to a spot where the group begins to dig. Finding nothing there, Legrand has Jupiter climb the tree again and drop <b>the</b> <b>bug</b> through the skull's other eye; they choose a different spot to dig, this time finding two skeletons and a chest filled with gold coins and jewelry. They estimate the total value at $1.5 million, but even that figure proves to be below the actual worth when they eventually sell the items.|$|E

5|$|Micro Machines was {{completed}} in September 1990. The game did not go through quality assurance, and as a result, a major bug that caused the game to crash was discovered near completion. <b>The</b> <b>bug</b> occurred when the player tried to reverse on the first race, and escaped notice because none of the testers thought to do so as {{they thought it was}} so easy. It was determined that just one binary bit was wrong, and a device that functioned like a miniature Game Genie was installed on the cartridges to correct it, as by the time <b>the</b> <b>bug</b> was discovered, there were plenty of ROM chips containing the bugged version. Micro Machines was released for the NES by Camerica in 1991. Nintendo wanted development halted because Codemasters did not have a licence from them, and sued Galoob over the sales of the Game Genie. Courts ruled in Galoob's favour (Nintendo appealed, but the ruling was upheld), but the legal issues meant that sales of the NES version were not as good as hoped.|$|E

5|$|When he proves {{unable to}} defeat Data-Sora himself, Pete infects Data-Riku's code with bugs and forces him to fight, putting the datascape {{in danger of}} being totally corrupted. Seeing no alternative, Data-Sora chooses to debug Data-Riku from inside, an act which will cause the datascape to reset if he succeeds, wiping his memories. The {{debugging}} process also activates <b>the</b> <b>bug</b> responsible for the data's corruption, which takes the form of Sora's Heartless. Data-Sora destroys <b>the</b> <b>bug</b> while Mickey and the others are returned to their world by Data-Riku before the reset occurs. In a scene exclusive to HD 2.5 ReMix, after Maleficent and Pete take their leave, Maleficent speaks with Pete about the Book of Prophecies, an ancient artifact capable of transcribing events that have yet to take place and even conjuring them, including entire worlds; she resolves to find it, believing it may hold a connection with the datascape and the journal.|$|E

5|$|The Russian forces, however, kept advancing. The Polish army, {{under the}} command of Józef Poniatowski, was still {{retreating}} in order, yielding to the more powerful enemy as necessary to avoid annihilation, according to the Prince's judgement. In early July, near Dubno, Prince Poniatowski and Kościuszko were betrayed by Michał Lubomirski, who was tasked with King Poniatowski with resupplying the troops; instead Lubomirski joined the Russian side, and either hid the supplies for the Polish army, or outright passed them to the Russians. Lubomirski, however, was a powerful magnate, and it took until late May for the King to officially relieve him of his command. Within about a month of the Russian invasion, the Poles have mostly retreated from Ukraine. On 7 July Kościuszko's forces fought a delaying battle with the Russians at Volodymyr-Volynskyi (Battle of Włodzimierz). Meanwhile, Poniatowski's army retreated to <b>the</b> <b>Bug</b> River, where Kościuszko's units fought the Battle of Dubienka on 18 July to a draw. With about 5,300 troops Kościuszko defeated the attack of 25,000 Russians under General Michail Kachovski. Kośicuszko then had to retreat from Dubienka, as the Russians begun flanking his positions crossing the nearby Austrian border. Although the Poles had to retreat from <b>the</b> <b>Bug</b> River line, they were not defeated so far, and a decisive battle or battles at more favorable locations closer to Warsaw were expected.|$|E
5|$|The {{above-mentioned}} migration {{was undertaken}} by {{a part of}} the Jastorf population, which probably included the tribes later called Bastarnae and Scirii in Greek written sources, noted because of their military exploits around Greece and Greek colonies in the later part of the 3rd century BC. Their route went along the Warta and Noteć rivers, then crossed Kujawy and Masovia, turned south along <b>the</b> <b>Bug</b> River and continued on to what today is Moldavia, where they settled and developed the Poienesti-Lukasevka culture. The route is marked by archeological findings, especially the characteristic bronze crown-shaped necklaces.|$|E

5|$|Both Polish and Russian {{planners}} expected {{an attack}} on Warsaw—and Radzymin in particular—from the east. Yet the first fights started to the north-east of the Polish capital. Warsaw was to be assaulted from the east by the 16th Red Army. At {{the same time the}} 14th Red Army (under Ieronim Uborevich) captured Wyszków and started a fast march westwards, towards Toruń. It was then to cross the lower Vistula and assault Warsaw from the north-west. However, its 21st Rifle Division remained {{on the south side of}} <b>the</b> <b>Bug</b> River and headed for Warsaw directly, under orders from Russia's Commissar of War Leon Trotsky.
