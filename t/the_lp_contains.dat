50|$|The Best of Ray Stevens is a {{collection}} of previously recorded songs by Ray Stevens for Mercury Records, the very first label that Stevens signed with. It was released in 1968 by a subsidiary of Mercury called Wing Records. It is {{not to be confused with}} the 1967 compilation of the same name.

The back of the album cover contains an essay by Stuart Lewis that describes Stevens' ability to interpret dramatic songs as much as comedic songs. Lewis' essay begins with comparing this collection with a person, stating that it has two different sides. Indeed, the first side of <b>the</b> <b>LP</b> <b>contains</b> five of his serious songs, while the second side contains five of his novelty songs.|$|E

Five of the album's eight tracks were composed by Williams, with the only legitimate hit being [...] "Wedding Bells," [...] which hit #2 in 1949. [...] "A Mansion on the Hill" [...] failed to make the Top 10 in late 1948, peaking at #12. None of the remaining songs (mostly B-sides) charted at all. [...] "Wealth Won't Save Your Soul" [...] had actually been recorded for Sterling Records and released as Hank's second single before he moved to MGM in April 1947.|$|E
