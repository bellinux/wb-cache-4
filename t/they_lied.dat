5|$|The Egyptian {{identification}} card controversy {{began in the}} 1990s when the government modernized the electronic processing of identity documents, which introduced a de facto requirement that documents must list the person's religion as Muslim, Christian, or Jewish (the only three religions officially recognized by the government). Consequently, Bahá'ís were unable to obtain government identification documents (such as national {{identification card}}s, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, or passports) necessary to exercise their rights in their country unless <b>they</b> <b>lied</b> about their religion, which conflicts with Bahá'í religious principle. Without documents, {{they could not be}} employed, educated, treated in hospitals, travel outside of the country, or vote, among other hardships. Following a protracted legal process culminating in a court ruling favorable to the Bahá'ís, the interior minister of Egypt released a decree on 14 April 2009, amending the law to allow Egyptians who are not Muslim, Christian, or Jewish to obtain identification documents that list a dash in place of one of the three recognized religions. The first identification cards were issued to two Bahá'ís under the new decree on 8 August 2009.|$|E

25|$|Electronic {{processing}} {{locked out}} the possibility of an unlisted religion, or any religious affiliation other than Muslim, Christian, or Jewish. Consequently, adherents of any other faith (or no faith) became unable to obtain any government identification documents (such as national identification cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, or passports) necessary to exercise their rights in their country unless <b>they</b> <b>lied</b> about their religion.|$|E
25|$|The ruling left Bahá'ís {{unable to}} obtain the {{necessary}} government documents to have rights in their country unless <b>they</b> <b>lied</b> about their religion, which conflicts with Bahá'í religious principle. However a 2008 ruling accepted the compromise solution offered by the Bahá'ís, allowing for them to obtain identification papers without the Bahá'í Faith being officially recognized, however through February 2009 there have been appeals and procedural choices made trying not to give such cards. The first identification cards were issued to two Bahá'ís, though, under the new policy on 8 August 2009.|$|E

She was heard saying, [...] "Oh, crap, now you know what ... <b>they</b> <b>lied</b> to , and Coz is a fool." [...] McKinney returned on screen with the microphone, this time with instructions on what parts of the interview the station was allowed to use: [...] "anything that is captured by your audio ... that is captured while I'm not seated in this chair is off the record and is not permissible [...] to be used ... is that understood?"

40|$|Do we feel {{bound by}} our own misrepresentations? Does one act of {{cheating}} compel the cheater to make subsequent choices that maintain the false image even at a cost? To answer these questions we employed a two-task paradigm such {{that in the first}} task the participants could benefit from false reporting of private observations whereas in the second they could benefit from making a prediction in line with their actual, rather than their previously reported observations. Thus, for those participants who inflated their report during the first task, sticking with that report for the second task was likely to lead to a loss, whereas deviating from it would imply that <b>they</b> had <b>lied.</b> Data from three experiments (total N= 116) indicate that, having lied, participants were ready to suffer future loss rather than admit, even if implicitly, that <b>they</b> had <b>lied...</b>|$|R
