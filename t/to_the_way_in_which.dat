5|$|Director Bill Condon {{originally}} intended to include most songs from the Broadway musical adaptation of Beauty and the Beast in the remake. However, Disney ultimately decided to recruit composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice to write entirely new songs for the film instead. Original Beauty and the Beast composer Menken reunited with Rice, {{with whom he had}} previously collaborated on Disney's animated film Aladdin (1992), to write three new songs for the remake. Rice once again replaced original Beauty and the Beast lyricist Howard Ashman, who had passed away shortly before the animated film's release in 1991, similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> he replaced the lyricist to aid Menken in writing new material for the 1994 stage adaptation. Menken believes that the songs he and Rice had written for the stage musical would not have translated well to the screen due to structural differences between the two formats.|$|E
5|$|Pliny {{correctly}} {{identifies the}} origin of amber as the fossilised resin of pine trees. Evidence cited includes {{the fact that some}} samples exhibit encapsulated insects, a feature readily explained by the presence of a viscous resin. Pliny refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it exerts a charge when rubbed, a property well known to Theophrastus. He devotes considerable space to bees, which he admires for their industry, organisation, and honey, discussing the significance of the queen bee and the use of smoke by beekeepers at the hive to collect honeycomb. He praises the song of the nightingale.|$|E

5|$|Quite often {{milestone}} {{home runs}} such as round hundred and career records are considered breaking news, and sports news services give coverage to countdowns on impending milestone home runs. Several of Bonds' milestone home runs were given dedicated coverage on ESPN BottomLine, with Chasing Ruth and Chasing Aaron coverage being quite extensive {{for the few}} seasons preceding {{the breaking of the}} record. Sports collectible dealers and buyers pay exorbitant sums for paraphernalia associated with such milestones. The Baseball Hall of Fame covets such paraphernalia for display. In fact, players are even sensitive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> their paraphernalia is displayed. A baseball that was hit for a milestone causes such a mêlée and such hysteria that special balls have to be used to stop counterfeiting, and police escorts are necessary for those who catch such balls.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Millionaires {{basic set}} {{is a direct}} {{adaptation}} of the British version's set design, which was conceived by Andy Walmsley. Paul Smith's original licensing agreement for the U.S. Millionaire required that the show's set design, along with all {{other elements of the}} show's on-air presentation (musical score, lighting system, host's wardrobe, etc.), adhere faithfully <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they were presented in the British version; this same licensing agreement applied to all other international versions of the show, making Walmsley's Millionaire set design the most reproduced scenic design in television history. The original version of the U.S. Millionaires set cost $200,000 to construct. The U.S. Millionaires production design is handled by George Allison, whose predecessors have included David Weller and Jim Fenhagen.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{considerable}} public backlash <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{some of the}} provisions of the War Precautions Act were applied, particularly in relation to certain sections of the community such as trade unions and other sections of the community that were for various reasons not as sympathetic to the British cause as the wider community. Indeed, in 1917, following the suppression of a prominent trade union and the jailing of 12 of its members on charges of sedition and sabotage, it seemed as if Australia's war effort might have been in danger of breaking down.|$|E

5|$|While {{humans have}} the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an {{environment}} in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on communities of speakers in which children learn language from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to communicate and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to language contact. The process is similar to the process of evolution, where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a phylogenetic tree.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the major}} bodies of the Solar System orbit the Sun in nearly the same plane. This is likely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the Solar System formed from a protoplanetary disk. Probably the closest current {{representation}} of the disk {{is known as the}} invariable plane of the Solar System. Earth's orbit, and hence, the ecliptic, is inclined a little more than 1° to the invariable plane, and the other major planets are also within about 6° of it. Because of this, most Solar System bodies appear very close to the ecliptic in the sky. The ecliptic is well defined by the motion of the Sun. The invariable plane is defined by the angular momentum of the entire Solar System, essentially the summation of all of the orbital motions and rotations of all the bodies of the system, a somewhat uncertain value that requires precise knowledge of every object in the system. For these reasons, the ecliptic is used as the reference plane of the Solar System out of convenience.|$|E

25|$|Binary {{stars are}} {{classified}} into four types according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they are observed: visually, by observation; spectroscopically, by periodic changes in spectral lines; photometrically, {{by changes in}} brightness caused by an eclipse; or astrometrically, by measuring a deviation in a star's position caused by an unseen companion. Any binary star can belong to several of these classes; for example, several spectroscopic binaries are also eclipsing binaries.|$|E
25|$|Heideggerians {{regarded}} Søren Kierkegaard as, by far, {{the greatest}} philosophical contributor to Heidegger's own existentialist concepts.

40|$|International health {{programmes}} {{have been}} a major stimulus <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of several specialties collectively known as medical behavioural science. Each new programme of the international and national agencies has led to an expansion of the areas of behavioural scientists in health research. This may also be expected from WHO's Food Safety Programme; its activities, and the findings contained in the report of a recently held meeting of a Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Safety, are bringing <b>to</b> light <b>the</b> need for, and the opportunities in, behavioural science research on food safety. Although significant behavioural research has been done in nutrition and the treatment of diarrhoeal diseases, almost no attention has been paid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which food is rendered unsafe for human consumption or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which food safety can be increased.

25|$|Similarly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{atoms and}} {{molecules}} emit electromagnetic radiation, a gravitating mass {{that is in}} quadrupole type or higher order vibration, or is asymmetric and in rotation, can emit gravitational waves.

For example, planets orbiting the Sun constantly lose energy via gravitational radiation, but this effect is so small that it is unlikely it will be observed in the near future (Earth radiates about 200 watts (see gravitational waves) of gravitational radiation).|$|E
25|$|Sometimes saints {{are shown}} {{together}} {{in a sort of}} pictorial gallery, but the depiction of narratives is also common.

25|$|As a result, {{development}} of Fat Man was given high priority. Chemical explosives {{were used to}} implode a sub-critical sphere of plutonium, thus increasing its density and making it into a critical mass. The difficulties with implosion centered {{on the problem of}} making the chemical explosives deliver a perfectly uniform shock wave upon the plutonium sphere— if it were even slightly asymmetric, the weapon would fizzle. This problem was solved by the use of explosive lenses which would focus the blast waves inside the imploding sphere, akin <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> an optical lens focuses light rays.|$|E
