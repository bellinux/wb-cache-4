25|$|The 1970s {{and early}} 1980s were {{a time of}} {{transition}} for typewriters and word processors. At one point in time, most small-business offices would be completely 'old-style', while large corporations and government departments would already be 'new-style'; other offices would have a mixture. The pace of change was so rapid that it was common for clerical staff <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> several new systems, one after the other, {{in just a few}} years. While such rapid change is commonplace today, and is taken for granted, this was not always so; in fact, typewriting technology changed very little in its first 80 or 90 years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{author has}} stated that she enjoys writing Dumbledore because he [...] "is the epitome of goodness." [...] Rowling said that Dumbledore speaks for her, as he [...] "knows pretty much everything" [...] about the Harry Potter universe. Rowling {{mentioned}} that Dumbledore regrets [...] "that he has always {{had to be the}} one who knew, and who had the burden of knowing. And he would rather not know." [...] As a mentor to the central character Harry Potter, [...] "Dumbledore is a very wise man who knows that Harry is going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> a few hard lessons to prepare him for what may be coming in his life. He allows Harry to get into what he wouldn't allow another pupil to do, and he also unwillingly permits Harry to confront things he’d rather protect him from." [...] In a 1999 interview, Rowling stated that she imagined Dumbledore [...] "more as a John Gielgud type, you know, quite elderly and– and quite stately." [...] During his time as a student, Dumbledore was in Gryffindor House. Rowling said in an interview that Dumbledore was about 150 years old. However, on her website, she states that Dumbledore was born in 1881, making him either 115 or 116 when he died.|$|E

But if you saw other ships wrecked near you, you would form {{judgments}} from their fate of what you ought to do. If you could find accounts of shipwrecks, you would study them with the most intense interest; lest you too should be wrecked, and so judgment overtake you for your bad seamanship.|$|E

5000|$|Four contestants {{were locked}} in an {{underground}} bunker in a secret location with no timepieces. The contestants were required <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> a series of challenges, which included mind, body and dexterity types. They faced off against the others until one of them won {{and went on to}} a final. The ultimate prize of the show was a Mini Cooper.|$|E
2500|$|Sound {{is at the}} {{beginning}} of language <b>learning.</b> Children <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> distinguish different sounds and to segment the speech stream they are exposed to into units – eventually meaningful units – in order to acquire words and sentences. Here is one reason that speech segmentation is challenging: When you read, there are spaces between the words. No such spaces occur between spoken words. So, if an infant hears the sound sequence “thisisacup,” it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> segment this stream into the distinct units “this”, “is”, “a”, and “cup.” Once the child is able to extract the sequence “cup” from the speech stream it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> assign a meaning to this word. Furthermore, the child <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be able to distinguish the sequence “cup” from “cub” in order <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that these are two distinct words with different meanings. Finally, the child <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> produce these words.|$|R
2500|$|On August 8, 1975 Williams {{was nearly}} {{killed in a}} mountain-{{climbing}} accident. While he was climbing Ajax Peak in Montana, the snow beneath him collapsed and he fell almost 500 feet onto rock. He suffered multiple skull and facial fractures. The incident was chronicled in the semi-autobiographical, made-for-television film [...] He {{spent two years in}} recovery, having several reconstructive surgeries in addition <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> talk and sing again. To hide the scars and the disfigurement from the accident, Williams grew a beard and began wearing sunglasses and a cowboy hat. The beard, hat, and sunglasses have since become his signature look, and he is rarely seen without them. In 1980, Hank Williams, Jr. appeared on the PBS show Austin City Limits during Season 5, along with The Shake Russell-Dana Cooper Band.|$|R

Harold Wilson's proposal of an international maritime force to quell the crisis was adopted by President Johnson, but received little support, with only Britain and the Netherlands offering to contribute ships.

50|$|In a {{changing}} environment, an animal must constantly gain new information to survive. However, {{in a stable}} environment, this same individual needs to gather the information it needs once, and then rely on {{it for the rest}} of its life. Therefore, different scenarios better suit either learning or innate knowledge.Essentially, the cost of obtaining certain knowledge versus the benefit of already having it determines whether an animal evolved to learn in a given situation, or whether it innately knew the information. If the cost of gaining the knowledge outweighes the benefit of having it, then the animal does not evolve to learn in this scenario—but instead, non-learning evolves. However, if the benefit of having certain information outweighs the cost of obtaining it, then the animal is far more likely to evolve <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> this information.|$|E

Despite pleas by Klinger to assist him, Radar refuses and tells Klinger {{that he is going}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how to do the company clerk job on his own, mentioning that no one had helped him when he first came to the 4077th. Ultimately, Radar is guilted into helping Klinger by Major Winchester, who chides Radar's selfishness for being eager to leave for home while the 4077th is still without power.|$|E

50|$|The {{downfall}} of NLS, and subsequently, of ARC in general, was the program's difficult learning curve. NLS {{was not designed}} {{to be easy to}} learn; it employed the heavy use of program modes, relied on a strict hierarchical structure, did not have a point-and-click interface, and forced the user <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> cryptic mnemonic codes to do anything useful with the system. The chord keyset, which complemented the modal nature of NLS, forced the user to learn a 5-bit binary code if {{they did not want to}} use the keyboard. Finally, with the arrival of the ARPA Network at SRI in 1969, the time-sharing technology that seemed practical with a small number of users became impractical over a distributed network; time-sharing was rapidly being replaced by individual minicomputers (and later microcomputers) and workstations. Attempts to port NLS to other hardware, such as the PDP-10 and later on the DECSYSTEM-20, were successful, but did nothing to spread NLS beyond SRI.|$|E
5000|$|Foster had skipped bail {{while under}} house arrest in Fiji and entered Vanuatu by boat. He was seen wading ashore on 8 January and apprehended by Vanuatu police on 14 January after failing {{to appear in court}} in Fiji on fraud charges. He was arrested for illegal entry to the country. On arrest, Foster claimed to be ill, but a doctor {{declared}} that he was well and fit to appear in court. He was sentenced to six weeks imprisonment, the sentence was backdated to the date of his arrest and he was fined 120,000 vatu (A$1,400). He was released from jail on 4 February after serving three weeks. Foster reached a deal with the Vanuatu government and was deported to Australia, in spite of being wanted for separate fraud charges in Fiji and Micronesia.
