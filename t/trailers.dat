5|$|In 1919, {{the company}} ordered seven new trams from Skabo, with {{electric}} equipment from Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB). These {{were the first}} in the country to have Norwegian-built electrical equipment, and also allowed for multiple-unit train control. They were delivered in 1920 and 1921. In addition, six <b>trailers</b> were built from Hannoversche Waggonfabrik (HaWA) The delivery of new rolling stock required a new depot building at Holtet, two new electric arc transformers and a ticket price increase. The HaWa <b>trailers</b> were delivered in 1925. However, the two-axled <b>trailers</b> did not give as smooth a ride, and in 1927 the company ordered bogie <b>trailers</b> from Atelier Métallurgique de Nivelles, which were put into service in 1928 and 1929.|$|E

5|$|Electric {{multiple}} units began running on 1 January 1905 and by 20 March all local services between Baker Street and Harrow were electric. The use of six-car trains was considered wasteful on the lightly used line to Uxbridge and in running an off-peak three-car shuttle to Harrow the Met aroused the displeasure of the Board of Trade {{for using a}} motor car to propel two <b>trailers.</b> A short steam train was used for off-peak services {{from the end of}} March while some <b>trailers</b> were modified to add a driving cab, entering service from 1 June.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Oslo Sporveier was {{in need of}} new trams to operate on their network. Except for 40 {{articulated}} SL79-trams that had been delivered between 1982 and 1990, the company had several series of non-articulated trams with <b>trailers</b> that were built before 1960. The largest series were 13 SM53s, 11 rebuilt SM83s and 28 <b>trailers,</b> in addition to 34 SM91s that had been bought used from the Gothenburg Tramway in 1991. Oslo Sporveier considered several possibilities for new trams, including ordering additional SL79s, purchasing motorized <b>trailers</b> for SL79, purchasing new low-floor trams, purchasing trams from ČKD Tatra, purchasing the 11 used TT Class 8 trams from Trondheim, rebuild the SL79s with an additional section or purchasing used articulated trams from abroad. Purchasing used material and rebuilding the SL79s was quickly rejected. A non-articulated Tatra tram was tested in Oslo during January 1991.|$|E

The Ausf. B model saw its use broadened to tow heavier weapons like the 5 cm PaK 38 as well as their ammunition <b>trailers.</b> They also served in the maintenance and supply companies of motorized and tank units. Nine were delivered to Romania in 1942 as tractors for anti-tank guns.|$|E

5|$|The {{first order}} for {{electric}} multiple units was placed with Metropolitan Amalgamated in 1902 for 50 <b>trailers</b> and 20 motor cars with Westinghouse equipment, which ran as 6-car trains. First and third class accommodation was provided in open saloons, second class being {{withdrawn from the}} Met. Access was at the ends via open lattice gates and the units were modified {{so that they could}} run off-peak as 3-car units. For the joint Hammersmith & City line service, the Met and the GWR purchased 20 × 6-cars trains with Thomson-Houston equipment. In 1904, a further order was placed by the Met for 36 motor cars and 62 <b>trailers</b> with an option for another 20 motor cars and 40 <b>trailers.</b> Problems with the Westinghouse equipment led to Thomson-Houston equipment being specified when the option was taken up and more powerful motors being fitted. Before 1918, the motor cars with the more powerful motors were used on the circle with three <b>trailers.</b> The open lattice gates were seen as a problem when working above ground and all of the cars had gates replaced with vestibules by 1907. Having access only through the two end doors became a problem on the busy circle and centre sliding doors were fitted from 1911.|$|E
