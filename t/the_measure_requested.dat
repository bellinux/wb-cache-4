40|$|Abstract—To provide {{satisfactory}} customer experience, modern server clusters like Amazon usually set Service Level Agreement (SLA) as guaranteeing {{a certain}} percentile (i. e. 99 %) {{of the customer}} requests to have a response time within a threshold (i. e. 1 s). One way to meet the SLA constraint is to serve the customer requests with sufficient computing capacity based on the worstcase workload estimation in the server cluster. However, this may cause unnecessary power consumption in the server cluster due to over-provision of the computing capacity especially when the workload is highly dynamic. In this paper, we propose an adaptive computing capacity allocation scheme referred to as TailCon. TailCon aims at minimizing the power consumption in the server cluster while satisfying the SLA constraint by adjusting the number of active servers and the CPU frequencies of the turnon machines online. In TailCon, we analyze {{the distribution of the}} request response time dynamically and leverage <b>the</b> <b>measured</b> <b>request</b> response time to estimate the workload intensity in the server cluster, which is used as a continuous feedback to find the proper provision of the computing capacity online based on optimization techniques.

40|$|The {{disputes}} {{concerning the}} Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo raised important {{issues relating to}} {{the relationships between the}} Security Council and the International Court of Justice, by re-proposing, in a highly dramatic context, some of the problems already seen in the so called Lockerbie Case. Even in relation to such disputes the involvement of the ICJ has been preceded by some initiatives taken by other UN organs, in particular by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII, in order to settle the crisis. Moreover, a further source of interest {{lies in the fact that}} the problem at issue was raised during an ongoing armed conflict of extreme gravity. Such a conflict can undoubtedly be considered as a sheer “regional” war: in fact, not only it has caused a dramatic escalation of violence among several ethnic groups fighting against each other in the Great Lake region, but it has also determined the participation of the neighbouring States in the hostilities. After a short illustration of the origins and the evolution of the conflict in the DRC and a brief description of the initiatives which were assumed by the United Nations, and especially by the Security Council, in coordination with the regional organizations directly involved into the crisis, this article carefully analyzes the way the ICJ treated the disputes in order to clarify the issue of the relationship between the Court and the Security Council. At least two main criticisms may be raised on the ICJ order on Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (DRC v. Uganda) : by confirming its reticence to deal with questions concerning its relationships with the Security Council, the Court lost a chance to clarify its point of view with regard to the criteria and the rules to be applied in the interpretation of SC resolutions. In fact, while the Court has often discussed the content and the nature of the rules which governed treaty interpretation, it has never considered the issue of the identification of the principles which regulate the exegesis of Security Council acts so far. Moreover, the decision leaves another fundamental question completely unsolved, namely: could the judges have indicated <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> <b>requested</b> by <b>the</b> Applicant if the interpretation of ris. 1304 (2000) claimed by Uganda had been found correct? The second criticism concerns the specific solution that has been reached by the Court. The DRC expressly requested the Court to provide adequate and effective measures with a view to settling the dispute. Instead <b>the</b> Court indicated <b>measures</b> which were generic and stated that both the DRC and Uganda must take all necessary measures to comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1304 (2000).

5000|$|On 25 and 26 May {{the bill}} was {{discussed}} in the Chambre. It was proposed by Bertrand Clauzel, an old soldier of the First French Empire who had been recalled by the July Monarchy and promoted to Marshal of France. In the commission's name he approved the choice of Les Invalides as the burial site, not without discussing the other suggested solutions (besides Saint-Denis, the Arc de Triomphe, the Colonne Vendôme, the Panthéon de Paris and even the Madeleine had been suggested to him). He proposed that the funding be raised to 2 million, that the ship bringing the remains back be escorted by a whole naval squadron and that Napoleon {{would be the last}} person to be buried in the Invalides. Speeches were made by the republican critic of the Empire Glais-Bizoin, who stated that [...] "Bonapartist ideas are one of the open wounds of our time; they represent that which is most disastrous for the emancipation of peoples, the most contrary to the independence of the human spirit." [...] The proposal was defended by Odilon Barrot (the future president of Napoleon III's council in 1848), whilst the hottest opponent of it was Lamartine, who found <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> dangerous. Lamartine stated before the debate that [...] "Napoleon's ashes are not yet extinguished, and we're breathing in their sparks". Before the sitting, Thiers tried to dissuade Lamartine from intervening but received the reply [...] "No, Napoleon's imitators must be discouraged." [...] Thiers replied [...] "Oh! But who could think to imitate him today?", only to receive Lamartine's reply that then spread right round Paris - [...] "I do beg your pardon, I meant to say Napoleon's parodists." [...] During the debate Lamartine stated: Although I am an admirer of this great man, I am not enthusiastic about him with neither recollection nor foresight. I do not prostrate myself before this memory; I am not a follower of this Napoleonic religion, of the cult of force that for a time some have wished to substitute in the Nation's spirit for the serious religion of liberty. I also do not think it will be good ceaselessly to deify war, to encourage these over-impetuous bubblings in the French blood, that make us appear impatient to wreck ourselves after a truce of 25 years - as if peace, which is the good fortune and glory of the world, could be the shame of nations. ... Let us, who take liberty seriously, make our views known in a measured way. Let us not appeal to the opinion of a people who better understand what dazzles them than what serves them. Let us not wholly efface, or so much decrease, our monarchy of reason, our new, representative and peace-loving monarchy. It would end up disappearing from the people's eyes. ... it is good, Gentlemen; I do not oppose this, I applaud it: but pay attention to these encouragements to genius at any price. I am doubtful for the future. I do not like these men who have liberty, legality and progress as their official doctrine, and as their symbol a sabre and despotism. In conclusion Lamartine invited France to show that [...] "she not wish to create out of this ash war, tyranny, legitimate monarchs, pretenders, or even imitators". Hearing this peroration, which was implicitly directed against him, Thiers looked devastated on his bench. Even so, the Chambre was largely favourable and voted through <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> <b>requested,</b> although by 280 votes to 65 it did refuse to raise the funding from 1 to 2 million.

The commitment to maintain the gold standard system prevented the Federal Reserve expanded its money supply operations in 1930 and 1931, and it promoted Hoover's destructive balancing budgetary action to avoid the gold standard system overwhelming the dollar. As the Great Depression became worse, the call raised for increasing in federal intervention and spending. But Hoover refused to allow the federal government to force fixed prices, control the value of the business or manipulate the currency, in contrast, he started to control the dollar price. For official dollar prices, he expanded the credit base through free market operations in federal reserve system to ensure the domestic value of the dollar. He also tended to provide indirect aid to banks or local public works projects, refused to use federal funds to give aid to citizens directly, which will reduce public morale. Instead, he focused on volunteering to raise money. Even though Hoover was a philanthropist before becoming president, his opponents regarded him as not responsible for the citizens.
