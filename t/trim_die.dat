500|$|The {{following}} are the four steps in traditional die casting, also known as , these are also the basis {{for any of the}} die casting variations: die preparation, filling, ejection, and shakeout. The dies are prepared by spraying the mold cavity with lubricant. The lubricant both helps control the temperature of the die and it also assists in the removal of the casting. The dies are then closed and molten metal is injected into the dies under high pressure; between [...] Once the mold cavity is filled, the pressure is maintained until the casting solidifies. The dies are then opened and the shot (shots are different from castings because there can be multiple cavities in a die, yielding multiple castings per shot) is ejected by the ejector pins. Finally, the shakeout involves separating the scrap, which includes the gate, runners, sprues and flash, from the shot. This is often done using a special <b>trim</b> <b>die</b> in a power press or hydraulic press. Other methods of shaking out include sawing and grinding. A less labor-intensive method is to tumble shots if gates are thin and easily broken; separation of gates from finished parts must follow. This scrap is recycled by remelting it. The yield is approximately 67%.|$|E
40|$|AISI D 2 steels {{are widely}} used as tools for forming, drawing and {{trimming}} dies due to its high wear resistance, high compressive strength and low distortion, and its performance as a <b>trim</b> <b>die</b> material for cutting ultra-high strength steels (at 1 GPa or above) is investigated in this study. To simulate the production trimming process under a laboratory accelerated fatigue condition, a <b>trim</b> <b>die</b> simulator and testing technique have been developed. In this test 12 ̆ 2 cubic die samples were used that offers total 12 cutting edges of 6 different material grain orientations in shearing, and with adjustable die clearance. A non-contact metal removal volume measurement was developed to quantify the degree of fatigue damage during cyclic loading, and the metallurgical replica method was used at different number of cycles from the interrupted testing for obtaining micro-damage information. The damage rate {{at the cutting edge}} was obtained as a function of trimming process variables, including the die material grain orientations, the loading frequency, and the amplitude of fatigue loading. The microstructure, micro-damage and fractured surfaces were examined with optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The results show that there exist two types of distinct damage processes: the continuous contact deformation process that occurs at a low fatigue load, and the discontinuous cutting edge chipping process at a high fatigue loading with significantly higher material removal rate. The chipping involves crack initiation and propagation within the carbide phase surrounding the pro-eutectic grains, leading to grain broken and fall apart. An empirical <b>trim</b> <b>die</b> damage rate model in Paris law form is obtained from experimental data regression, and can be used for tool life prediction. The grain orientation relative to the cutting direction is found to have remarkable effect on trimming damage rate...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It’s simple {{technology}} to manufacture big <b>trimming</b> <b>die</b> by hardfacing on the die insert of steel. In this paper, {{a kind of}} surface hardfacing technology which deposited by using D 322 on 42 CrMo steel were studied instead of traditional manufacturing process. The effect of hardfacing parameters on microstructure, hardness and wear resistance are tested and analyzed. The key points of manufacturing <b>trimming</b> <b>die</b> by using hardfacing method was given out. There are no defects in the hardfacing layer. The average hardfacing layer is higher than 57. 5 HRC. The hardfacing surface has good figurations and hardfacing layer has good wear resistance. The hardfacing for real product of <b>trimming</b> <b>die</b> is completed successfully and their properties reach or exceed those of dies made with traditional technology. This technology is also an effective approach of repairing other cold working dies. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} hardfacing technology has much more advantages, cheaper than that of traditional process.

40|$|Nowadays, most of {{the tools}} of Volvo Cars Body Components (VCBC) in Olofström are {{hardened}} by flame hardening or induction hardening process. Indeed, VCBC has developed their own equipment for flame and induction hardening: However, Volvo has detected that 74 % of {{the total cost of}} one year maintenance was caused by <b>trim</b> <b>dies</b> and the main reason is actually trim edge problems which represent 26 % of year maintenance.

40|$|Trim 33 (Tif 1 Γ, ectodermin, moonshine), {{a member}} of the TIF 1 family of {{transcriptional}} coactivators and corepressors, is a large nuclear protein that contains an N-terminal tripartite (Trim) domain composed of a RING domain, two B-box domains, and a coiled coil domain. It has been suggested that Trim 33 (Ectodermin) mediates ectodermal induction in the Xenopus by functioning as a Smad 4 ubiquitin ligase, while in the zebrafish Trim 33 (moonshine) has been reported to act as a R-Smad binding protein in induction of erythroid differentiation. Since the developmental role of Trim 33 in mammals is currently unknown, we generated mice carrying the conditional Trim 33 (Trim 33 FX) allele by flanking exons 2 – 4 encoding most of the functionally critical N-terminal tripartite domain by loxP sites.

40|$|In recent years, {{the life}} cycle of car models has {{decreased}} from 7 to 5 years and the volume sizes are becoming shorter in the automotive industry. The increasing number of car models introduced to the market means that a fewer number of parts must pay the costs for the tool/die design and manufacturing. In consequence, {{there is a need for}} reducing the manufacturing cost and lead time for the tool and die manufacturing. The higher product requirements (reduced weight, increased safety and lower emissions) have meant that a larger number of car body parts must be made in AHSS (Advanced High Strength Steels). This has led to a significantly larger abrasive and fatigue tool wear. The tool wear is therefore expected to increase even more in the future, if the issue is not addressed properly. Today the total maintenance cost of the trimming tools are approximately 70 % of the total die maintenance cost in a press shop. The purpose of this thesis is to increase the knowledge of how surface topography and geometry on <b>trimming</b> <b>dies</b> influences tool wear, tool life and part quality. Methods to analyze wear, measure cutting edge radius on production dies and methods to analyze surface topography have been established. The cutting edge geometry has been evaluated with respect to the cutting edge radius and the angle of the upper tool. Experimental testing together with FE simulation has been used. Results show that by using a cutting edge radius of 80 µm, rather than 20 µm, the tool “wear in phase” can be more controlled. Sheet metal trimming when cutting at high angles (25 ° - 60 °) has been evaluated. Two versions of the geometry on the lower cutting edge was tested, a traditional geometry and a 1. 5 mm shelf geometry. Results show that the shelf geometry reduces side force, especially for the higher angles. The shelf geometry also reduces the sharpness off the cut edge profile, thus increasing part quality, compared to the traditional geometry. Surfaces on both semi-industrial test dies and dies used in production were analyzed with different surface topography analysis methods. The result shows that the wear process is different on the different sides of the trimming edge. The texture direction of the surface is changed due to wear, with the strongest change on the clearance side of the edge. The roughness on sheet side of the edge is reduced due to a hammering effect from the sheet material. The result on the semiindustrial test dies and the production dies correlates well. Future research will be continued on surface topography and trimming edge geometry and its relationship to used manufacturing methods and tool wear...|$|R

40|$|Transforming Growth Factor – beta {{signaling}} plays important, pleiotropic {{roles in}} embryonic development {{as well as}} tissue homeostasis. TGF-beta signaling dose is tightly regulated in a context-specific manner and even subtle perturbations result in a spectrum of disease phenotypes of varying severity. In the canonical TGF-beta pathway, TGF-beta signals are mediated by activated receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads, Smad 2 / 3) that form a complex with Smad 4 and participate in transcriptional regulation of TGF-beta-mediated genes with sequence specific DNA binding factors and context-specific co-regulators. Both Smad 2 / 3 and Smad 4 regulate signal duration and intensity differentially. This {{is consistent with the}} variability and spectrum of phenotypes observed upon their conditional deletions in mice, with Smad 2 / 3 -associated phenotypes being more severe than those associated with Smad 4. However, precise mechanisms that modulate the functional and phenotypic differences attributed to Smad 2 / 3 and Smad 4 are poorly understood. Tripartite motif containing (Trim) 33 - a co-regulator of both activated Smad 2 / 3 and Smad 4, is a candidate gene for understanding fine tuning mechanisms of TGF-beta signaling. Here, I have investigated the role of Trim 33 in early embryogenesis.

Epiblast-specific <b>Trim</b> 33 mutants <b>die</b> {{during the second half of}} gestation as a result of ensuing cardiac failure.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} {{our experience}} with bowel vaginoplasty done in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of eight children aged 10 months to 8 years, who underwent bowel vaginoplasty {{over a period}} of 5 years (2000 - 2005). The indications of bowel vaginoplasty included anorectovestibular fistula (ARVF) associated with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome (n= 6) and cloaca (n= 2). The bowel segment used for vaginoplasty included colon (n= 3), ileum (n= 2) and duplicated rectum (n= 1). In two patients of ARVF associated with uterovaginal agenesis, the distal- most part of ARVF was transected at the level of peritoneal reflection and left as neovagina, whereas the proximal bowel was pulled through at the proposed neo-anal site. All the patients were advised daily home dilatation of the neo vaginal orifice with Hegar&#x 2032;s dilators, for a period of six weeks. RESULTS: Bowel vaginoplasty was done in eight patients. None had any significant per-operative complication. Two patients had abdominal wound dehiscence, requiring secondary suturing.
