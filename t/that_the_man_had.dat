5|$|In 1552, Las Casas {{published}} A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies. This book, {{written a}} decade earlier {{and sent to the}} attention of then-prince Philip II of Spain, contained accounts of the abuses committed by some Spaniards against Native Americans during the early stages of colonization. In 1555 his old Franciscan adversary Toribio de Benavente Motolinia wrote a letter in which he described Las Casas as an ignorant, arrogant troublemaker. Benavente described indignantly how Las Casas had once denied baptism to an aging Indian who had walked many leagues to receive it, only on the grounds that he did not believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> received sufficient doctrinal instruction. This letter, which reinvoked the old conflict over the requirements for the sacrament of baptism between the two orders, was intended to bring Las Casas in disfavour. However, it did not succeed.|$|E

Thiers warned this species may be toxic after being alerted to severe {{gastrointestinal}} symptoms in one who had merely tasted it. Years later, in 1994, a couple developed gastrointestinal symptoms after eating this fungus and the husband died as a result. A subsequent autopsy revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> suffered an infarction of the midgut. Rubroboletus pulcherrimus was the only bolete that had been implicated {{in the death of}} someone consuming it, It is known to contain low levels of muscarine, a peripheral nervous system toxin. until 2005. A report from Australia records a fatality from muscarinic syndrome after consuming a mushroom from the genus Rubinoboletus.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} local science museum has a display of meteorites, the Fringe team is able to secure Dr. Crick (Alan Ruck), {{the man behind the}} osmium injections, and another {{paraplegic}} who has taken Dr. Crick's injections as they attempt to steal the display. With Dr. Crick in custody, Walter learns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> worked in aerospace to find an alloy for fighter craft. He happened upon the combination of the osmium-lutetium alloy that generated a material lighter than air, and sought to refine a permanent solution to give his own paraplegic son the ability to walk, having promised the same to those that had died from earlier, lethal doses of the alloy.|$|E

5|$|Subfossils {{were also}} {{recovered}} during the 1860s, but more complete remains were found during the 1874 transit of Venus, since an observation station was {{located on the}} island. Many of these excavations were requested by brothers Alfred and Edward Newton, who used them to describe the osteology of the bird in detail. Thousands of bones were excavated, and mounted skeletons were composed from the remains of several specimens. It {{has been suggested that}} the skeleton of this species is the best described after that of humans. In spite of this, some later scholars doubted Leguat's story, and the existence of the Rodrigues solitaire. In 1955, George Evelyn Hutchinson doubted aspects of the bird's biology mentioned by Leguat, and in 1921, G. Atkinson claimed the memoir was merely a novel, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> never even existed. Today, it is widely accepted that Leguat's memoirs are credible observations of the bird in life.|$|E

25|$|Before Hildegard's death, {{a problem}} arose with the clergy of Mainz. A man buried in Rupertsburg had died after excommunication from the Church. Therefore, the clergy wanted {{to remove his}} body from the sacred ground.

25|$|In {{writing about}} the {{conspiracy}} of Catiline, Sallust's tone, style, and descriptions of aristocratic behavior {{show that he was}} deeply troubled by the moral decline of Rome. While he inveighs against Catiline's depraved character and vicious actions, he does not fail to state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> many noble traits, indeed all that a Roman man needed to succeed. In particular, Sallust shows Catiline as deeply courageous in his final battle.|$|E

Two {{weeks after the}} riot, a non-Jewish man {{was killed by a}} group of black men; some {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> been mistaken for a Jew. The riots were a major issue in the 1993 mayoral race, contributing to the defeat of Mayor David Dinkins, an African American, who was blamed for an ineffective police response.|$|E

25|$|An autopsy found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> died of foul play, {{remarking}} something initially puzzling: {{ice crystals}} in blood vessels near his heart. His interior organs also had decayed {{at a rate}} far slower than his skin. Pathologists concluded that someone had frozen his body after death {{in an attempt to}} mislead investigators into believing he died at a later time than he actually did. The man was identified as someone on the periphery of Mafia activities in nearby Rockland County, New York.|$|E
25|$|On 23 July 1997, {{at around}} 4.30 pm, a sixteen-year-old boy {{discovered}} {{the body of}} a man, lying face down, at the base of an old water tower in Keillers Park, in downtown GÃ¶teborg. Called on site, the police determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> been shot twice with a pistol. The first bullet hit him in the back and went right through the heart, while the second was fired to his head as he lay on the ground. A bag and a head cap were recovered beside the body.|$|E
25|$|The {{stomach and}} {{intestines}} were examined and tests {{carried out on}} their contents. Scientists identified the man's last meal as porridge or gruel made from grains and seeds, both cultivated and wild. Approximately 40 kinds of seeds were identified, but the porridge was primarily composed of four types: barley, flax, false flax (Camelina sativa) and knotgrass. From the stage of digestion it was concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> eaten 12 to 24 hours prior to his death. Porridges were common for people of this time. Because neither meat nor fresh fruit {{was found in the}} last meal, it is suggested that the meal was eaten in winter or early spring when these items were not available.|$|E

25|$|As strike-related {{violence}} mounted, Colorado governor Elias M. Ammons {{called in}} the Colorado National Guard on October 28. At first, the Guard's appearance calmed the situation, but the sympathies of Guard leaders lay with company management. Guard Adjutant-General John Chase, who had served during the violent Cripple Creek strike 10 years earlier, imposed a harsh regime. On March 10, 1914, {{the body of a}} replacement worker was found on the railroad tracks near Forbes, Colorado. The National Guard said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> been murdered by the strikers. In retaliation, Chase ordered the Forbes tent colony destroyed. The attack was launched while the inhabitants were attending a funeral of two infants who had died a few days earlier. The attack was witnessed by photographer Lou Dold, whose images of the destruction appear often in accounts of the strike.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, archaeologists {{discovered}} at Giv'at ha-Mivtar in northeast Jerusalem {{the remains of}} one Jehohanan, who had been crucified in the 1st century. The remains included a heel bone with a nail driven through it from the side. The tip of the nail was bent, perhaps because of striking a knot in the upright beam, which prevented it being extracted from the foot. A first inaccurate account {{of the length of}} the nail led some to believe that it had been driven through both heels, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> been placed in a sort of sidesaddle position, but the true length of the nail, 11.5cm (4.53inches), suggests instead that in this case of crucifixion the heels were nailed to opposite sides of the upright. The skeleton from Giv'at ha-Mivtar is currently the only recovered example of ancient crucifixion in the archaeological record.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{his lack}} of learning, Tráº§n Thá»§ Äá» was praised as a skilled and devoted {{official}} of the Tráº§n Dynasty, the ruling dynasty which was found by his very own effort. As a result, the grand chancellor held a position in royal court which was so powerful that he was suspected by some of overruling the Emperor. Once there {{was a person who}} went to the Emperor to report him about this suspicion, ThÃ¡i TÃ´ng immediately visited Tráº§n Thá»§ Äá»'s place with this man and made him tell everything in front of the grand chancellor. After hearing the story, Tráº§n Thá»§ Äá» not only accepted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> somewhat his reason but also awarded him for being concerned for the Tráº§n Dynasty. His successful governing was considered by historical books as the main factor that not only led to the stability of Early Tráº§n period but also contributed to the victory of Äáº¡i Viá»t over the first Mongol invasion.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains were}} found accidentally in an ossuary with the crucified man's name on it, 'Jehohanan, {{the son of}} Hagakol'. Nicu Haas, an {{anthropologist}} at the Hebrew University Medical School in Jerusalem, examined the ossuary and discovered that it contained a heel bone with a nail driven through its side, indicating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> been crucified. The position of the nail relative to the bone indicates that the feet had been nailed to the cross from their side, not from their front; various opinions have been proposed {{as to whether they}} were both nailed together {{to the front of the}} cross or one on the left side, one on the right side. The point of the nail had olive wood fragments on it indicating that he was crucified on a cross made of olive wood or on an olive tree. Since olive trees are not very tall, this would suggest that the condemned was crucified at eye level.|$|E

He joined the freight {{shipping}} operation that his father worked for and was given a position known as [...] "second boss" [...] for a wagon trip to New Mexico.
