40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the interactions between}} employment and <b>training</b> <b>policies.</b> Their effectiveness in stimulating income and employment may be interdependent for various important reasons. For example, the more employment policies stimulate the employment rate, the greater {{the length of time}} over which workers use the human capital generated by <b>training</b> <b>policies.</b> Moreover, the greater the government expenditures on employment and <b>training</b> <b>policies,</b> the higher the taxes required to finance these expenditures and these higher taxes reduce aggregate income. On account of such effects, employment and <b>training</b> <b>policies</b> may be complementary or substitutable with respect to aggregate income. To analyze these interactions, we construct a simple, dynamic model of hiring decisions, derived from microfoundations. The model is calibrated with German data. The simulation shows that there are signifcant interactions between both policies. In the absence of government-budget-constraint effects, there are complementarities, but the government budget constraint introduces substitutabilities. The analysis provides a methodology for examining policy interactions which may be useful well beyond the bounds of employment and <b>training</b> <b>policies.</b> complementarities; hiring subsidies; training subsidies; vocational training; employment; unemployment...|$|R

25|$|The post-shooting {{investigation}} found no weapons on Diallo's body; the item {{he had pulled}} out of his jacket was not a gun, but a rectangular black wallet. The internal NYPD investigation ruled the officers had acted within policy, based on what a reasonable police officer would {{have done in the}} same circumstances with the information they had. The Diallo shooting led to a review of police <b>training</b> <b>policy</b> and the use of full metal jacket (FMJ) bullets. On March 25, 1999, a Bronx grand jury indicted the four officers on charges of second-degree murder and reckless endangerment. All four officers' bail were set at $100,000. On December 16, an appellate court ordered a change of venue to Albany, New York, stating that pretrial publicity had made a fair trial in New York City impossible. On February 25, 2000, after two days of deliberation, a jury in Albany acquitted the officers of all charges. Officer Kenneth Boss had been previously involved in an incident where an unarmed man was shot. Another black man, 22-year-old Patrick Bailey, died after Boss shot him on October 31, 1997. As of 2012, Boss is the only remaining officer working for the NYPD. After his acquittal, Boss was disarmed and reassigned to desk duty. In October 2012, Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly restored Boss' ability to carry a firearm against the protests of Diallo's family. On December 17, 2015, Kenneth Boss, received a promotion to the rank of sergeant despite objections from the victim’s mother and civil rights activists. Boss was promoted in accordance to police policy, which is not subject to review by top department officials.|$|E

40|$|WP 24 / 14; Sociological and {{economical}} literatures agree in asserting that individual {{integration in the}} labour market represents an important vehicle of social inclusion. In fact, individual exclusion from the labour market could have economical (poverty), sociological (disrepute and weakening of relational networks) and psychological (impoverishment of self-esteem) effects that eventually could bring to a spreading and persistent social exclusion. Vocational <b>training</b> <b>policies,</b> as they are conceived in Piedmont and more generally in Italy, are particularly helpful in contrasting such individual weakness and social exclusion. This is due to its pedagogical and didactical methods and to the attention that vocational <b>training</b> <b>policies</b> pay to the improvement of individual relational and professional skills. Both the programming and management phases of vocational <b>training</b> <b>policies</b> need, to be effective, to include an evaluation process that highlights its weak and strength points.

40|$|Page 131 is blank {{from the}} {{original}} copyThe research project involved an analysis of social work education and <b>training</b> <b>policies</b> and programmes within a statuatory welfare agency in New Zealand (the Department of Social Welfare). A functionalist epistemology and methodology {{was used to examine}} the Department's inservice social work <b>training</b> <b>policies</b> and programmes. It is argued that there are four central elements to address in social work education and training: the theoretical base, the knowledge base, skills training, and personal development. It is also argued that social work education and training should be informed by empirical study of the nature of social work practice. The thesis states that an analysis of inservice social work education and <b>training</b> <b>policies</b> and programmes would reveal that social work training within the Department of Social Welfare is: reactive to Issues of the day; comprised of a 'patchwork' of unco-ordinated elements; and is centred on meeting the needs of the agency, rather than systematically preparing social workers for practice. It was found that inservice social work <b>training</b> <b>policies</b> and programmes within the Department of Social Welfare were not based on an explicit theoretical perspective, nor were they grounded in empirical study of the nature of social work practice. Further, the analysis indicated that the four elements of social work education were unevenly covered on training courses and that theory and practice were not integrated. These findings largely support the thesis...|$|R
