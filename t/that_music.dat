5|$|Ilaiyaraaja's {{first two}} non-film albums were explorations in {{the fusion of}} Indian and Western {{classical}} music. The first, How to Name It? (1986), {{is dedicated to the}} Carnatic master Tyāgarāja and to J. S. Bach. It features a fusion of the Carnatic form and ragas with Bach partitas, fugues and Baroque musical textures. The second, Nothing But Wind (1988), was performed by flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia and a 50-piece orchestra and takes the conceptual approach suggested in the title— <b>that</b> <b>music</b> is a natural phenomenon akin to various forms of air currents (e.g., the wind, breeze, tempest etc.).|$|E
5|$|Musical {{instruments}} such as zithers {{appeared in}} Chinese writings around 12th century BC and earlier. Early Chinese philosophers such as Confucius (551–479 BC), Mencius (372–289 BC), and Laozi shaped {{the development of}} musical instruments in China, adopting an attitude toward music {{similar to that of}} the Greeks. The Chinese believed <b>that</b> <b>music</b> was an essential part of character and community, and developed a unique system of classifying their musical instruments according to their material makeup.|$|E

5|$|Reznor is {{an outspoken}} critic of the music industry, {{particularly}} the influence <b>that</b> <b>music</b> businesses have exerted upon his creative freedom.

5|$|Though Madonna {{is often}} overshadowed by her producers, {{she has her}} moments, and she is never more {{inspired}} than on the so-silly-it's-great 'Impressive Instant', yet another homage to the music that leaves her and legions of followers 'spinning, baby, out of control'. She deserves credit for allowing her latest interpretation of <b>that</b> <b>music</b> to be bent, folded and so lovingly mutilated by her collaborators, and when she chirps, 'I like to singy singy singy/Like a bird on a wingy wingy wingy', I can envision discos from Stockholm to Sacramento going bonkers with her.|$|E
5|$|Angelina was {{introduced}} as Angelo's daughter {{who had a}} {{dream of becoming a}} successful recording artist. Angelo's girlfriend Gloria requested <b>that</b> <b>music</b> producer Devon should help her out, only for everyone to find out she had no talent. Angelina developed a crush on Gloria's son, Kevin Fisher, who was already engaged to his girlfriend Chloe. Angelina attempted to seduce Kevin, making Chloe hate her. Angelo put Kevin in charge of keeping Angelina safe from her dangerous ex-boyfriend Carmine Basco (Marco Dapper). Devon found out that Angelina sang well only if staring into Kevin's eyes. At Kevin and Chloe's wedding, Angelina told Kevin that she was pregnant with Carmine's child and that they needed to leave town immediately. Kevin ran away with her after shots were fired during the wedding ceremony.|$|E

500|$|Guido Fackler has {{researched}} {{evidence that}} indicates {{that it is possible}} <b>that</b> Wagner's <b>music</b> was used at the Dachau concentration camp in 1933–34 to [...] "reeducate" [...] political prisoners by exposure to [...] "national music". There has been no evidence to support claims, sometimes made, <b>that</b> his <b>music</b> was played at Nazi death camps during the Second World War, and Pamela Potter has noted <b>that</b> Wagner's <b>music</b> was explicitly off-limits in the camps.|$|R
50|$|It {{could be}} argued <b>that</b> <b>Musics</b> was a major {{influence}} on the development of new ideas about world music, though never totally able to transcend the white imperialist mentality typical of victims of the education system and artists.|$|R
5|$|As with Nero, it is {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>music</b> from Florindo or Daphne was recycled by Handel for use in later works. The overture to the opera Rodrigo consists of eight French-style dances, which Cudworth believes might have begun life as ballet music in one or other of the lost Hamburg operas. In 1709–10 Handel composed the cantata Apollo e Dafne, which has common ground with the earlier operas. Harris {{makes the point that}} when writing the cantata, Handel would have recalled his earlier setting, and perhaps borrowed from it. Dean and Knapp provide further example of works in which the Florinda and Daphne music may have re-emerged: the oratorio Il trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno (1707); the opera Radamisto (1720); and the overture in B flat, HWV336, which Baselt conjectures might have been written as the overture to Florindo. This last-named has been combined with HWV352–354 and HWV356 to form the Suite from the operas Florindo and Daphne, which in 2012 was adapted and recorded by The Parley of Instruments under Peter Holman.|$|E
5|$|Because Hope was a {{work that}} was {{impossible}} to read using the traditional interpretation of symbolism in painting, Watts intentionally left its meaning ambiguous, and the bleaker interpretations were almost immediately challenged by Christian thinkers following its exhibition. Scottish theologian P. T. Forsyth felt that Hope was a companion to Watts's 1885 Mammon in depicting false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them {{in the absence of}} faith. Forsyth wrote that the image conveyed the absence of faith, illustrated that a loss of faith placed too great a burden on hope alone, and that the message of the painting was that in the godless world created by technology, Hope has intentionally blinded herself and listens only to <b>that</b> <b>music</b> she can make on her own. Forsyth's interpretation, that the central figure is not herself a personification of hope but a representation of humanity too horrified at the world it has created to look at it, instead deliberately blinding itself and living in hope, became popular with other theologians.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} {{different}} circumstances from which they came, and in which they played, the rhythm and blues produced by British artists was very different in tone from that created by African Americans, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. They have been criticised for exploiting the massive catalogue of African American music, {{but it has also}} been noted that they both popularised <b>that</b> <b>music,</b> bringing it to British, world and in some cases American audiences, and helping to build the reputation of existing and past rhythm and blues artists. In order to sustain their careers most British R artists soon moved on from recording and performing American standards to writing and recording their own music. Many from the 60s helped pioneer psychedelic, and eventually progressive, hard rock and heavy metal, mixing in elements of world, folk and classical music. Others from the 1970s and 1980s, helped shape new wave and post-punk music and had a major impact on later genres, including Britpop. As a result, British rhythm and blues has been a major component of the sound of rock music.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} each {{game in the}} Myst series has fallen to various composers. Originally, the Millers {{believed}} that any music or sound besides ambient noise would distract the player from the game and ruin the sense of reality; Myst, therefore, was to have no music at all. A sound test eventually persuaded the developers <b>that</b> <b>music</b> heightened the sense of immersion rather than lessening it, and as such Robyn Miller composed 40 minutes of synthesized music for the game. He would also produce the music for Riven, which featured leitmotifs {{for each of the}} main characters. Virgin Records bought the rights to the music and produced the soundtracks, which were released in 1998.|$|E
5|$|When {{creating}} {{the music for}} the film, Snow {{had a couple of}} months to write and produce the music, composing the television series simultaneously. The film marked {{the first time in the}} history of the franchise <b>that</b> <b>music</b> was composed and recorded with the help of an orchestra, although, according to Snow, there was no significant change in the recording and writing process during the production of the film. The most substantial difference was that Snow used MIDI files to save his musical scores and pieces, which would afterward be sent to a copyist who would take it through one of their programs and eventually give it to the orchestrators.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Harmonix and {{the small}} {{publisher}} RedOctane released Guitar Hero, a game inspired by Bemani's GuitarFreaks. However, instead of the Japanese pop that comprises the earlier title's soundtrack, Guitar Hero features Western rock music. The game reinvigorated the rhythm genre, which had stagnated because of a flood of Dance Dance Revolution sequels and imitations. Guitar Hero spawned several sequels, and the franchise overall earned more than $1 billion, with the third installment ranking as the best selling game in North America in 2007. Harmonix followed Guitar Hero with the Rock Band franchise, which also earned over $1 billion. Rock Band titles support multiple instrument controllers and cooperative multiplayer, allowing players to play as a full band. The Guitar Hero franchise followed suit with the band-oriented, Neversoft-developed Guitar Hero World Tour. Guitar Hero installments based on specific bands, such as Metallica and Aerosmith, were also published. Additional songs for Guitar Hero and Rock Band were made available for purchase via the Internet, which generated further revenue. Artists whose work is featured in the games receive royalties, and the increased publicity in turn generates further sales of their music. The success of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises widened the console video game market and its demographics, and {{the popularity of the}} genre drove increased sales of consoles. In 2008, it was reported <b>that</b> <b>music</b> games had become the second most popular video game genre (behind action) in the United States, with 53% of players being female. At its height in 2008, music games represented about 18% of the video game market.|$|E
50|$|Although Asian Americans {{had been}} {{performing}} jazz <b>music</b> almost since <b>that</b> <b>music's</b> inception {{in the early}} 1900s, {{it was not until}} the late 20th century when a distinctly Asian-American brand of jazz began to develop, sometimes drawing on traditional Asian music and/or using Asian instruments.|$|R

25|$|Another meta-study {{examined}} the proposed neurological mechanisms behind music therapy's effects on these patients. Many authors suspect <b>that</b> <b>music</b> has a soothing {{effect on the}} patient by affecting how noise is perceived: music renders noise familiar, or buffers the patient from overwhelming or extraneous noise in their environment. Others suggest <b>that</b> <b>music</b> serves {{as a sort of}} mediator for social interactions, providing a vessel through which to interact with others without requiring much cognitive load.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} such {{references}} that indicate <b>that</b> <b>music</b> {{was an integral}} part of the Greek perception of how their race had even come into existence and how their destinies continued to be watched over and controlled by the Gods.

25|$|At his wife's request, Prigent {{attended}} the first rave party held in Rennes, in 1993, {{in spite of}} his negative prejudice.

25|$|Music therapy {{can be used}} {{to improve}} {{function}} in patients that have lesions resulting from stroke or other disorders. More recent research suggests <b>that</b> <b>music</b> can increase a patient's motivation and positive emotions. Current research also suggests that when music therapy is used in conjunction with traditional therapy it improves success rates significantly. Therefore, it is hypothesized <b>that</b> <b>music</b> therapy helps a victim of stroke recover faster and with more success by increasing the patient's positive emotions and motivation, allowing him or her to be more successful and feel more driven to participate in traditional therapies.|$|E
