The group sees itself as an asset-based trader, <b>trading</b> <b>electricity,</b> gas and carbon certificates. Added to this, Repower also markets electricity from renewable resources to large consumers and resellers throughout Europe. On the physical side of the business Repower delivers electricity - part of which is generated by Repower itself, part of which is bought in from outside - to wholesale customers, usually via the high-voltage grid. The company also deals in certificates to deliver environmental value-added to larger end-consumers, independently of the grid. At the wholesale level the group delivers standard products such as base, peak and off-peak, as well as profiles.|$|E
50|$|The {{business}} model behind the electric utility {{has changed over}} the years playing a vital role in shaping the electricity industry into what it is today; from generation, transmission, distribution, to the final local retailing. This has occurred prominently since the reform of the electricity supply industry in England and Wales in 1990. In some countries, wholesale electricity markets operate, with generators and retailers <b>trading</b> <b>electricity</b> in a similar manner to shares and currency. As deregulation continues further, utilities are driven to sell their assets as the energy market follows in line with the gas market in use of the futures and spot markets and other financial arrangements. Even globalization with foreign purchases are taking place. One such purchase was when the UK’s National Grid, the largest private electric utility in the world, bought New England’s electric system for $3.2 billion. Domestically, local electric and gas firms have merged operations as they saw the advantages of joint affiliation, especially with the reduced cost of joint-metering. Technological advances will take place in the competitive wholesale electric markets, such examples already being utilized include fuel cells used in space flight; aeroderivative gas turbines used in jet aircraft; solar engineering and photovoltaic systems; off-shore wind farms; and the communication advances spawned by the digital world, particularly with microprocessing which aids in monitoring and dispatching.|$|E

30|$|For suppliers, RTP {{produces}} {{new challenges}} for estimating consumptions. Traditional estimations based on consumptions {{of the previous}} year or general statistics are no more applicable, as consumption progressions differ between years. This is intended for DR, as consumptions shall follow power availability, which also differs between years, e.g. because wind and solar farms lead to a correlation between availability and weather conditions. Hence, suppliers need new means to estimate their customers’ consumption for given retail price functions or they need means for controlling DR loads directly, leading to known consumptions. Note that DA-RTP is different from day-ahead auctions, used for <b>trading</b> <b>electricity</b> at wholesale energy exchanges. At exchanges, trades are only concluded for matching bids (Konstantin 2013). As trades are always concluded some time before power flow, the amount of power to be delivered or consumed is always known accurately, not requiring estimations.|$|E

40|$|Artículos en revistasThe {{traditional}} {{distribution function}} actually comprises two separate activities: distribution network and retailing. Retailing, {{which is also}} termed supply, consists of <b>trading</b> <b>electricity</b> at the wholesale level and selling {{it to the end}} users. The distribution network business, or merely distribution, is a natural monopoly and it must be regulated. Increasing attention is presently being paid to the regulation of distribution pricing. Distribution pricing, comprises two major tasks: global remuneration of the distribution utility and tariff setting by allocation of the total costs among all the users of the network services. In this paper, the basic concepts for establishing the global remuneration of a distribution utility are presented. A remuneration scheme which recognizes adequate investment and operation costs, promotes losses reduction and incentives the control of the quality of service level is proposed. Efficient investment and operation costs are calculated by using different types of strategic planning and regression analysis models. Application examples that have been used during the distribution regulation process in Spain are also presented. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

The concept of risk premium, as it is worked out by Bessembinder and Lemon (2002) is reviewed in our essay through the Markowitz portfolio theory. Unlike in the B-L model, where the variance of the spot price has a strictly negative relationship to the risk premium, it is shown that the portfolio theory gives us a different inference that the variance can have both negative and positive impacts according to the strength of supply and demand in the market. This empirically tested and found appropriate. Positive dependence of variance in the electricity markets have been found in Central Europe and Scandinavia, while in Iberian the results are still negative...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} uncertainties {{surrounding the}} benefits and costs of a policy to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions from electricity generation in the eastern U. S. Under each of 18 scenarios examined, we find an annual policy would yield net benefits that {{are at least as}} great as those expected under the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) currently planned seasonal policy. Preferred (midpoint) assumptions yield additional benefits of $ 724 million per year under an annual policy compared to a seasonal one (1997 dollars). The subset of 11 northeastern states benefit the most from an annual policy relative to a seasonal one, but relative net benefits are also positive in the remaining states in the region. An annual policy implemented on a national basis appears to be slightly less cost-effective than the EPA’s policy under midpoint assumptions but it is more cost-effective under half of the scenarios we examine. emissions <b>trading,</b> <b>electricity,</b> particulates, nitrogen oxides, NOX, health benefits, market structure, restructuring, deregulation, value of statistical life, uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} not only the impact of CO 2 emissions trading on the Iberian Electricity Market (IBELM) power industry, but also the likelihood for the reduction in the electricity sector emissions. A SIMulator for Electricity and Carbon markets (SIMEC) was developed for that purpose. Given the system power plants characteristics, demand data and CO 2 allowance prices, SIMEC computes the electricity market clearing price, power generation by technology, CO 2 emissions and power industry profits. A rise in electricity prices is expected when CO 2 constraints are in place with a sharp increase in off-peak hours, when normally coal power plants clear the market. Increases in electricity prices are evaluated for different scenarios of allowance prices. Producers that do not face carbon liabilities or facing less carbon liabilities than the market clearing technology will have a positive effect on profits. Moreover, due to the fact that fuel switching takes place only for higher CO 2 allowance prices than the EU 2005 emissions trading market prices, a global reduction in the Iberian power industry emissions is not likely to occur.
