5|$|The Servant's Hall, {{from which}} a {{staircase}} in the bay window descends <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> became the servant's dining room {{at the beginning of}} the 18th century. Outside, the six Doric columns on the East Terrace originally had decorative finials, now replaced by lamps.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} entrance, on {{the south}} side of the belltower, leads to a small vestibule from which short flights of stairs rise to the sanctuary level and descend <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ianto returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> and is devastated to find Lisa dead. He then {{sees the}} {{delivery}} girl, {{who has a}} large cut across her forehead; Lisa implanted her brain into the delivery girl. At first reluctant, Ianto aims his gun at her, but cannot bring himself to shoot her. The girl tries to explain she did this for Ianto, but then promises {{that they can be}} upgraded together. The rest of the Torchwood team, arriving to hear that, open fire and kill her, leaving Ianto to mourn.|$|E
30|$|The above {{suggests}} that the thermal conductivity contrast between the sedimentary basin filling and <b>the</b> crystalline <b>basement</b> is more significant than that between the sedimentary formations themselves, such that areas with thicker sedimentary piles have their isotherms bent upward, thus implying higher geothermal gradients. The reverse occurs for those of shallower basements (Fig.  11). This means that the conductive temperature distribution is sensitive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement’s</b> geometry.|$|R
50|$|Around 251,000 {{cubic metres}} of earth were {{excavated}} <b>to</b> form <b>the</b> <b>basements</b> and over 4,000 tons of support the Touchwood structure.|$|R
50|$|April 13, 1992, {{billions of}} dollars in damage was caused by the Chicago Flood, when a hole was accidentally drilled into the long-abandoned (and mostly-forgotten) Chicago Tunnel system, which was still {{connected}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basements</b> of numerous buildings in the Loop. It flooded the central business district with 250 million US gallons (950,000 m3) of water from the Chicago River.|$|R
5|$|Inside, the {{building}} held a two-story balconied main sanctuary and dining room, in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> kitchen and bathrooms. The heating system {{was in a}} sub-basement. The front ark and wood bimah in the sanctuary were ornate; the red velvet draped ark was elaborately decorated, and the bimah was also decorated, and supported a large bronze candelabra. The sanctuary floor was wood, with wood wainscoting and plaster walls.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, on September 28, 1903, the {{congregation}} relocated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> of St. Mary's Polish Church, {{which was also}} located in New Kensington. Here, the first parish register was created. The first recorded event in the new parish was a marriage on December 27, 1903. Soon after, the Burrell Improvement Company donated land {{on the corner of}} Ridge Avenue and Constitution Boulevard. On July 4, 1905, the cornerstone of St. Peter Church was laid and on September 25, 1905, Bishop Regis Canevin dedicated the new church.|$|E
5|$|The cerebrum, brainstem, cerebellum, {{and spinal}} cord {{are covered by}} three {{membranes}} called meninges. The membranes are the tough dura mater; the middle arachnoid mater and the more delicate inner pia mater. Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the subarachnoid space, which contains the cerebrospinal fluid. In the cerebral cortex, close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> membrane of the pia mater, is a limiting membrane called the glia limitans; this is the outermost membrane of the cortex.|$|E
50|$|The Rhinns complex, a {{deformed}} igneous {{complex that}} is considered <b>to</b> form <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Colonsay Group of metasedimentary rocks {{takes its name from}} the Rhinns of Islay.|$|R
50|$|If {{the water}} table outside <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> is above <b>the</b> height of <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> floor, then <b>the</b> {{foundation}} drains or the weeping tiles outside the footings may be insufficient <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> dry. A sump pump may be required. It can be located anywhere and is simply in a well that is deeper than <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> floor.|$|R
50|$|There was {{no crime}} scene {{investigation}} and no judicial authority was allowed <b>to</b> enter <b>the</b> <b>basements.</b> Instead <b>the</b> Turkish authorities arranged that the ruins were flattened, <b>the</b> <b>basements</b> {{filled up with}} rubble, and bodies were taken away. Therefore, Human Rights Watch suspects a cover-up.|$|R
5|$|A young Addie (Katelyn Reed) {{stares up}} at an old mansion when two {{troublesome}} twins Brian and Troy (Kai and Bodhi Schulz) arrive, planning to enter the house. Addie warns them not to enter the house, but they ignore her warning and enter the house anyway. While they wreak havoc, Brian discovers a dying animal and the twins find an open door <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement.</b> They enter the basement where they find jars containing animal remains and human fetuses. After complaining about the smell, Brian leaves the basement {{only to find that}} his brother has gone silent. He searches for him and finds him with his throat slit, gasping for air. The Infantata (Ben Woolf) appears behind him and kills him off screen.|$|E
5|$|As Scully {{heads to}} the other room to get ready, her FBI badge falls out of her coat pocket. Scully discreetly picks it back up without Ed noticing. The tattoo begins to talk again, convincing Ed to redial Scully's last call to see who she was {{speaking}} to. An FBI operator answers and, upon learning that Scully is an FBI agent, the tattoo forces Ed to attack her. Scully tries to escape but is overpowered by Ed, who wraps her in a bedsheet and carries her down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> to throw her in the furnace. At the last moment, Ed is able to overpower the impulses of the tattoo and instead thrusts his own arm into the furnace.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, {{the club}} was {{purchased}} by London Clubs, who moved their premises from the Devonshire Club on St James's Street <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> of the Ritz. A new company was formed in June 1998, the Ritz Hotel Casino Ltd., which was granted legal permission to open a casino. After very quick refurbishment, it reopened on 12 September with exclusive membership, although members are permitted to invite a guest. As of 2006 the Ritz Club was divided into four main areas—the restaurant, bar, lounge and the private gaming room, situated in the former Banqueting Hall. In July 2014, London High Court heard a case against the club, in which Nora Al-Daher claimed she was 'taken advantage' of and asked for £2 million in losses.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} of Peru sent {{a number of}} extradition requests to Chile concerning Fujimori. It requested his extradition to stand trial for murder {{in the cases of}} the Barrios Altos massacre and the La Cantuta massacre, both carried out by Grupo Colina. It also requested his extradition for kidnapping Samuel Dyer and Gustavo Gorriti, both of whom were abducted by Peruvian Army personnel during Fujimori's self-coup and brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basements</b> of <b>the</b> Intelligence Service.|$|R
5000|$|Reported {{sightings}} of ghosts include {{that of a}} small child {{on the top floor}} corridor and shadowy figures on Ward G. Visitors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basements</b> have reported an uneasy feeling and dragging noises have been heard from the Dining Room while nobody is there. The building now hosts nocturnal both private and public ghost hunts. It is now opened to ghost hunting events that accrue around autumn and are investigated by investigators and local people ...|$|R
50|$|Once the bubbler pool gates {{were opened}} by the Ananenko team, fire brigade pumps were then used <b>to</b> drain <b>the</b> <b>basement.</b> <b>The</b> {{operation}} was not completed until 8 May, after 20,000 {{metric tons of}} highly radioactive water were pumped out.|$|R
5|$|On July 2, 1862, William and Jim Anderson {{returned}} to Council Grove and sent an accomplice to Baker's house {{claiming to be}} a traveler seeking supplies. Baker and his brother-in-law brought the man to a store, where they were ambushed by the Anderson brothers. After a brief gunfight, Baker and his brother-in-law fled into the store's basement. The Andersons barricaded the door <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> and lit the store on fire, killing Baker and his brother-in-law. They also burnt Baker's home and stole two of his horses before returning to Missouri on the Santa Fe Trail.|$|E
5|$|Rideau Cottage is a two-level, 22-room Georgian Revival building. Originally, the {{structure}} had 14 rooms {{on a single}} floor. An 1872 remodel, using a different brick, added both the second level and a verandah on three sides of the ground floor. During that remodel, the exterior brick of the first floor was covered in stucco painted to appear like brick. (When the verandah was removed some time later, the stucco remained.) Between 1999 and 2000, the building underwent major renovations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> roof and interior finishes, and the mechanical and electrical systems were upgraded. Outside, the stucco was removed and each brick and joint was individually dyed to give a uniform appearance. It was again renovated in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Brick Lane {{screening}} – on 8 December 1995 – {{had been}} previewed in NME, and was chaotically busy. It was originally planned {{for a car}} park, but freezing conditions and snow forced a rethink and the screening was moved indoors, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> of the nearby Seven Stars pub. Hundreds of people crammed in to watch the screening, which was eventually abandoned partway through due to the cramped conditions. The NME preview had claimed that after the screening the film would be cut up and individual frames sold off to the public. Gimpo, {{the owner of the}} film, had no intention of doing so, but after the screening was nearly overwhelmed by a mob of people wanting to take home a piece of the film.|$|E
50|$|According <b>to</b> legend, <b>the</b> secret tunnels {{under the}} nearby Green Mill bar, a Prohibition-era hangout of Al Capone, lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Aragon's <b>basement.</b>|$|R

50|$|As {{seen with}} {{electron}} microscope, <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> membrane {{is composed of}} two layers, the basal lamina and the underlying layer of reticular connective tissue. The underlying connective tissue attaches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> basal lamina with collagen VII anchoring fibrils and fibrillin microfibrils. The two layers together are collectively referred <b>to</b> as <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> membrane.|$|R
5|$|The palace is {{structured}} {{around a large}} and paved courtyard. It has a trapezoidal plan, and the land falls away toward the river Ill. To compensate for the slope, the riverside (southern) façade of the main wing has four floors (including the Mansard roof), while the courtyard (northern) façade has three floors. The half-buried floor corresponds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> and now houses the archaeological museum (see below, Museums). The riverside façade is thus both the highest and the widest of the palace. The terrace before it, facing the quai des Bateliers, is closed at both ends by elaborate wrought-iron gates adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan.|$|E
5|$|This {{causes a}} power flicker in the Hub; Ianto makes {{an excuse to}} look into it himself and finds Tanizaki's body. As he leaves Lisa to hide the body, she drains even more power by {{re-entering}} the conversion unit. Believing the Hub is under attack, team leader Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) sends Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) and Owen Harper (Burn Gorman) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> where they find the abandoned conversion unit. Jack runs down to find Owen unconscious and Gwen about to be converted. He stops the process and attempts to shoot Lisa, but Ianto stops him, allowing Lisa to escape. Ianto pleads with Jack that they try to save her, but Jack affirms that there is no cure.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, the {{popularity}} of the hydrotherapy had declined to the extent that many hotels were already being converted into private boarding schools and rest homes, and education became the basis of Malvern's economy. By 1865, the town already had 17single-gender private schools, increasing to 25 by 1885. The area was well suited for schools due to its established attractive environment and access by rail. Children could travel unaccompanied with their trunks by rail to their boarding schools near the stations in Great Malvern, Malvern Wells, and Malvern Link. Malvern St James (formerly Malvern Girls College), located in a former hotel directly opposite Great Malvern railway station, has a dedicated (now derelict) tunnel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> of the building, which is clearly visible from both platforms of the station.|$|E
50|$|The {{station in}} a double track section has one {{underground}} island platform with two tracks. Stairs, escalators and elevators connect the platform on <b>the</b> second <b>basement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first <b>basement</b> concourse and then <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground level.|$|R
50|$|In 1978, R J Laburn {{undertook}} alterations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> staircase <b>basement</b> {{and first}} floor and in 1980, alterations were made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entrance hall.|$|R

5|$|A detective named Havez (Dwight McFee) {{takes over}} as Bruckman's guard when Mulder and Scully {{are called to}} {{investigate}} yet another new murder victim: the tarot card reader. As they leave they bump into a bellhop who is delivering food to Bruckman's room. The bellhop is actually the killer, and when he enters the room (while Havez is in the washroom), he is delighted to discover that Bruckman has been brought right to where he works. As {{he is about to}} kill Bruckman, Havez re-enters and the killer attacks and kills him instead. Meanwhile, Scully finds the same silk fiber at the new crime scene, and realizing that the bellhop had it on his tray, deduces that he is the murderer. They rush back to the hotel. Mulder chases the killer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> kitchen and the scene plays out as described in Bruckman's earlier premonition, but when the killer attacks Mulder, Scully arrives {{in the nick of time}} and shoots him—what Bruckman had seen was the dying killer's last thoughts, not Mulder's death.|$|E
5|$|Carlton {{then turned}} his {{attention}} to the other six residents, pouring gasoline underneath the door of the far end of the residence and setting it on fire. Draftsman Herbert Fritz managed to break open a window and escape, though he broke his arm in the process. Carlton then entered the other dining room and killed Brodelle. He then hid, waiting for the other residents to try to escape. As foreman William Weston and his 13-year-old son Ernest ran through the door, Carlton attacked with the hatchet. The Westons escaped, but Ernest died from his wounds hours later. Carlton sought out the final two residents, laborer Thomas Brunker and gardener David Lindblom. Brunker and Lindblom managed to fight off Carlton and escape, but died days later from their burns and injuries. With the house empty, Carlton ran <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> and into a fireproof furnace chamber. He brought a small vial of hydrochloric acid with him as a fallback plan in case the heat became too much for him to handle. Carlton did attempt suicide by swallowing the acid, but it failed to kill him.|$|E
5|$|Desperate, they free Chris, who {{reveals that}} Claire is his sister, and the prison has an armored car {{they can use}} to escape. However, a giant axe-wielding monster begins {{breaking}} down the gate. Alice, Chris and Crystal go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> armory to get more guns; however, zombies kill Crystal en route. Luther and Claire reinforce the gate. Angel informs Bennett and Yong the car is missing its engine, {{and it would take}} a week to fix. Bennett shoots Angel and heads for Arcadia in Alice's airplane. The Axeman breaks down the gate, allowing the zombies into the prison. The group decides to use the zombie-dug tunnels to escape into the sewers. Kim Yong is slashed in half by the Axeman, while Alice is knocked out. Claire successfully defends Alice, manages to defeat the Axeman and disorienting it, after which Alice kills it by firing at its head. Unfortunately, Luther is dragged back into the tunnels by a zombie.|$|E
