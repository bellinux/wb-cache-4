40|$|Increasing noise {{complaints}} are recorded from residential areas surrounding small airfields in Germany. As a consequence the German Ministry of Transport, Building and Housing set in force noise related traffic regulations for General Aviation (GA) aircraft, which were meant as an {{impetus for the}} aircraft operators to realize available noise reduction technologies. These regulations (German "Landeplatz-Lärmschutzverordnung") impose operational restrictions - at leisure times in particular - for aircraft without a <b>noise</b> <b>certificate</b> and for aircraft with noise levels which do not fall 4 to 7 dB below their relevant (Chapters 6 to 10) noise certification level. Exceptions are granted for cross-country flights. The philosophy of this regulation is to reduce <b>noise</b> originating from <b>the</b> most annoying circuit flights of training aircraft but not hamper GA-aircraft business operations. Seeking for a non restricted operation, therefore each individual aircraft type needs a <b>noise</b> <b>certificate</b> to establish its compliance with <b>the</b> required <b>noise</b> limits. This turns out as a hardship for older aircraft, which only comply with former - less stringent - noise limits, or which even {{do not have a}} <b>noise</b> <b>certificate</b> at all (if they got their airworthiness certificate before 1971). Such aircraft need an adequate retrofitting with low-noise propellers or engine exhaust mufflers. The respective technology has been developed in recent years, coming up with multiblade propellers, geared engines and innovative muffler designs. Based on the knowledge of respective <b>noise</b> reduction potentials <b>the</b> adequate technical solution (and the ensuing cost/benefit relation) has to be determined for each one aircraft type individually...|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>noise</b> {{properties}} of tubes at audio frequencies can be modeled well by a perfect noiseless tube having {{a source of}} voltage noise in series with the grid. For the EF86 tube, for example, this voltage noise is specified (see e.g., the Valvo, Telefunken or Philips data sheets) as 2 microvolts integrated over a frequency range of approximately 25 Hz to 10 kHz. (This refers to <b>the</b> integrated <b>noise,</b> see below for the frequency dependence of <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> spectral density.) This equals <b>the</b> voltage <b>noise</b> of a 25 kΩ resistor. Thus, if the signal source has an impedance of 25 kΩ or more, <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> of <b>the</b> tube is actually smaller than <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> of <b>the</b> source. For a source of 25 kΩ, <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> generated by tube and source are the same, so <b>the</b> total <b>noise</b> power at <b>the</b> output of the amplifier is twice <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> power at <b>the</b> output of the perfect amplifier. <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> figure is then two, or 3 dB. For higher impedances, such as 250 kΩ, <b>the</b> EF86's voltage <b>noise</b> is [...] lower than <b>the</b> sources's own <b>noise.</b> It therefore adds 1/10 of <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> power caused by the source, and <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> figure is 0.4 dB. For a low-impedance source of 250 Ω, on the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> voltage contribution of the tube is 10 {{times larger than the}} signal source, so that <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> power is one hundred times larger than that caused by <b>the</b> source. <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> figure in this case is 20 dB.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Development of {{a passive}} {{respiratory}} motion sensor based on <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> variance of <b>the</b> receive coil array. Methods: Respiratory motion alters the body resistance. <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> variance of an RF coil {{depends on the}} body resistance and, thus, is also modulated by respiration. For <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> variance monitoring, <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> samples were acquired without and with MR signal excitation on clinical 1. 5 / 3 T MR scanners. The performance of <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> sensor was compared with the respiratory bellow and with the diaphragm displacement visible on MR images. Several breathing patterns were tested. Results: <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> variance demonstrated a periodic, temporal modulation that was synchronized with the respiratory bellow signal. The modulation depth of <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> variance resulting from the respiration varied between the channels of the array and depended on the channel's location with respect to <b>the</b> body. <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> sensor combined with MR acquisition was able to detect the respiratory motion for every k-space read-out line. Conclusion: Within clinical MR systems, the respiratory motion can be detected by <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> in receive array. <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> sensor does not require careful positioning unlike the bellow, any additional hardware, and/or MR acquisition...|$|R

The transmitter indexes {{through at least}} two noise records which comprise a series of randomly generated samples, <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> records being divided into noise segments, to maintain a current noise segment for each <b>noise</b> record. <b>The</b> transmitter modulates a predefined base signal using the segments of <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> records to represent the symbols of the base signal. In modulating the predefined base signal, the transmitter replaces the respective symbols of the base signal with <b>the</b> current <b>noise</b> segments from <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> records, thereby generating a noise signal in which the symbols can not be discerned. <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> signal is transmitted across a communications channel to the receiver which demodulates <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> signal into <b>the</b> base signal.
