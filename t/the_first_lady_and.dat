She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration and her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones.

[...] Ray cited eight separate conversations between <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>and</b> senior staff and concluded: [...] "Mrs. Clinton’s input into the process was significant, if not the significant factor influencing the pace of events in the Travel Office firings and the ultimate decision to fire the employees." [...] Moreover, Ray determined Hillary Clinton had given [...] "factually false" [...] testimony when questioned by the GAO, the Independent Counsel, and Congress about the travel office firings, but reiterated that [...] "the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt" [...] that she knew her statements were false or understood that they may have prompted the firings.|$|E

[...] Judicial Watch's Cara Leslie Alexander et al. vs. Federal Bureau of Investigation et al. class action lawsuit, filed {{on behalf of}} {{several members of the}} Reagan and George H. W.

[...] Judicial Watch founder and Clintons antagonist suprême Larry Klayman attracted enough attention with the case to have the recurring Larry Claypool character modeled after him on the television series The West Wing. [...] As late as January 2000, Judicial Watch was filing affidavits in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia under Judge Royce C. Lamberth related to the case. [...] In their $90 million lawsuit, they claimed that the First Lady did, despite her denials, know Livingstone – indeed, that Livingstone had bragged to associates he was very close to both the president and his wife – and that Clinton had personally hired him for the security job. (White House defenders pointed out that Livingstone had a long history of exaggerating his importance and connections.) Judicial Watch also said they had five sources who claimed Livingstone had been hired by and worked under <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady,</b> <b>and</b> also discovered some photographs of Livingstone {{in the vicinity of the}} First Lady (but not talking with him). [...] In December 2002 Judicial Watch obtained a ruling from Judge Lamberth that recently uncovered White House e-mails be searched for possible evidence in the lawsuit. [...] Klayman said, [...] "Hillary Clinton was the mastermind of Filegate. She will not escape justice." [...] Klayman and Judicial Watch had a severe falling out in 2003, however, and several years went by with little or nothing happening in the lawsuit.|$|E

2500|$|Nixon's {{involvement}} in Watergate brought disgrace and a forced resignation in 1974 and any long-term movement toward the GOP {{was interrupted by}} the scandal. Gerald Ford succeeded Nixon {{and gave him a}} full pardon—thereby giving the Democrats a powerful issue they used to sweep the 1974 off-year elections. Ford never fully recovered and in 1976 he barely defeated Ronald Reagan for the nomination. The one positive to come from Ford's brief presidency was the outspoken personality of First Lady Betty Ford. Ford took several liberal positions on social issues regarding breast cancer awareness following her Mastectomy in 1974. To add to her outspoken persona, she was a staunch supporter of and activist for the Equal Rights Amendment, (ERA). Pro-choice on abortion and a leader in the women's movement, she gained fame {{as one of the most}} candid first ladies in history, commenting on every hot button issue of the time, including feminism, equal pay, the ERA, sex, drugs, abortion, civil rights, and gun control. Her liberal positions and her outspoken personality garnered her high approval ratings throughout her husband's term in office [...] despite opposition from the conservative wing of the GOP who objected to her liberal stances and even a few members of Ford's cabinet like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld advised Ford to ask her to tone down her outspoken views to avoid losing voters, but Ford declined to do so. Despite the candid nature of <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>and</b> the end of the Vietnam War, Democrats ended up with major gains in Congress and the taint of Watergate and the nation's economic difficulties contributed to the election of Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976, running as a Washington outsider.|$|E
