5|$|An {{important}} event following {{the conquest of}} the Carpathian Basin, the Bavarians' murder of Kurszán, was recorded by the longer version of the Annals of Saint Gall, the Annales Alamannici and the Annals of Einsiedeln. The first places <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>in</b> 902, while the others date it to 904. The three chronicles unanimously state that the Bavarians invited the Hungarian leader to a dinner on the pretext of negotiating a peace treaty and treacherously assassinated him. Kristó and other Hungarian historians argue that the dual leadership over the Hungarians ended with Kurszán's death.|$|E

5|$|Aside from {{professional}} wrestling performances, celebrity involvement {{has been a}} major key in the production of WrestleMania events. WWE involves celebrities in the WrestleMania events to gain more hype and media attention for <b>the</b> <b>event,</b> <b>in</b> this way receiving more attraction to the event, pay-per-view buys, and ticket sales. The celebrities involved with WrestleMania events have come from a range of occupations, including singing, acting, professional boxing, and modeling, and usually appear in non-wrestling roles, such as singing, promoting a subject, or managing wrestlers at ringside. There have been exceptions, however, in which celebrities have had a professional wrestling role.|$|E

5|$|Because The Birth of a Nation {{attracted}} increased scrutiny due {{to possible}} Oscar nominations, {{and the film}} itself depicts a brutal rape, there was significant press coverage about damage control by Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio releasing the film.

5|$|Before the event, the GFW {{broadcasts}} experienced setbacks.

According to Dave Meltzer, NJPW undercut GFW by including <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>in</b> the $8.42 monthly price for New Japan Pro Wrestling World; the GFW broadcast of Wrestle Kingdom 9 alone was $34.95. The New Japan Pro Wrestling World stream had Japanese commentary only.|$|E
