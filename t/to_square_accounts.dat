60|$|At {{first he}} refused, {{but when they}} {{threatened}} arrest he weakened. It took nearly three weeks of his salary <b>to</b> <b>square</b> <b>accounts,</b> and then {{the young man was}} utterly crushed. He never went sailing again.|$|E

[...] "Now," [...] he said, [...] "you {{know very}} well that your chance of finding gold on the new claim is good, and we can very easily afford to grub-stake you until you strike it. In this country it's quite a common arrangement. Apart from that--since you seem to be so {{abnormally}} sensitive--there's enough for you and me to do chopping wood for the oven in the evenings <b>to</b> <b>square</b> the <b>account</b> altogether. I have, of course, pointed that out already; but if you will make an effort, I think you will remember that {{there was a time when}} you insisted on lending me what was, in the circumstances, a considerable sum of money." ...|$|R

50|$|However, {{financial}} irregularities quickly began cropping up in Cargo's business dealings under Fox and Allen's management: some labels began {{to report that}} Cargo was making its own decisions about how many copies of an album to press without reporting back to the labels, often leaving the labels unable <b>to</b> <b>square</b> their <b>accounts</b> because of discrepancies {{between the number of}} copies they had ordered and the number that were actually sold and/or returned; many labels reported unpaid bills from Cargo that in turn left them unable to pay their bands; and some retail chains, including HMV, entirely ceased business dealings with Cargo due to the company's frequent delays in properly fulfilling orders. Mint Records suffered the highest-profile setback during this period when it lost Gob, then its most lucrative act, to Nettwerk because of Cargo's failure to pay Mint for sales of the band's album Too Late... No Friends.|$|R
5000|$|Grasmick {{was treated}} roughly in his MLB debut on April 22, 1948, against the {{eventual}} National League champion Boston Braves, allowing three earned runs, three bases on balls and two hits in one inning of work. Two days later, he allowed one run in four innings against the Brooklyn Dodgers (on {{a home run}} to Arky Vaughan), but did allow two inherited runners to score in an 11-4 Phillie defeat. He then returned to minor league baseball {{for the rest of}} his career. A single in his only at-bat left Grasmick with a rare MLB career batting average of 1.000. When once asked about knockdown pitches he stated: [...] "If you didn't thrown a knockdown, you were going to have problems with your teammates. You were expected to protect them. If the other pitcher threw at one for your players, then you had <b>to</b> <b>square</b> the <b>account.</b> It was the way the game was played. A different era now. And players then didn't have protective helmets." ...|$|R
40|$|How do we {{determine}} whether some candidate causal factor is an actual cause of some particular outcome? Many philosophers have wanted {{a view of}} actual causation which fits with folk intuitions of actual causation and {{those who wish to}} depart from folk intuitions of actual causation are often charged with the task of providing a plausible account of just how and where the folk have gone wrong. In this paper, I provide a range of empirical evidence aimed at showing just how and where the folk go wrong in determining whether an actual causal relation obtains. The evidence suggests that folk intuitions of actual causation are generated by two epistemically defective processes. I situate the empirical evidence within a background discussion of debunking, arguing for a two-pronged debunking explanation of folk intuitions of actual causation. I conclude that those who wish to depart from folk intuitions of actual causation should not be compelled <b>to</b> <b>square</b> their <b>account</b> of actual causation with the verdicts of the folk. In the dispute over actual causation, folk intuitions deserve to be rejected...|$|R

6000|$|If Dick Rover {{had been}} present he might have advised against visiting the Lorimer Spell claim. In a {{roundabout}} way he had heard from Carson Davenport.

"I {{shall be}} honest, and own {{that there may}} be some truth in it--for the Injin {{promises}} nothing, or next to nothing, and it is easy <b>to</b> <b>square</b> <b>accounts,</b> in such cases.

40|$|Determining {{the impacts}} on {{consumers}} of government policies affecting {{the demand for}} food products requires a theoretically consistent micro-level demand model. We estimate a system of demands for weekly city-level dairy product purchases by nonlinear three stage least <b>squares</b> <b>to</b> <b>account</b> for joint determination between quantities and prices. We analyze the distributional effects of federal milk marketing orders, and find results that vary substantially across demographic groups. Families with young children suffer, while wealthier childless couples benefit. We also find that households with lower incomes bear a greater regulatory burden due to marketing orders than those with higher income levels. *Corresponding author.

60|$|In {{the second}} act a grand Roman {{official}} is not above trying to blast Appelles' reputation by falsely charging him with misappropriating public moneys. Appelles, who is too proud to endure even the suspicion of irregularity, strips himself to naked poverty <b>to</b> <b>square</b> the unfair <b>account,</b> and his troubles begin: the blight which is to continue and spread strikes his life; for the frivolous, pretty creature whom he brought from Rome has no taste for poverty and agrees to elope with a more competent candidate. Her presence in the house has previously brought down the pride and broken the heart of Appelles' poor old mother; and her life is a failure. Death comes for her, but is willing to trade her for the Roman girl; so the bargain is struck with Appelles, and the mother is spared for the present.|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} performance and relationships between several management factors and {{financial performance}} are examined in {{a panel of}} 107 New York dairy farms. A panel regression model with fixed effects is estimated {{in an effort to}} identify management factors that influence profitability. The model is estimated with two-stage least <b>squares</b> <b>to</b> <b>account</b> for endogenous farm size and debt use variables. Production management factors such as farm size, rate of milk production, and milking system had a positive impact on farm profitability. Financial management variables for the type of accounting system used and the debt use were also significantly related to profitability. Unlike the findings of many other studies, measures of human capital did not have a statistically significant impact on profitability. Farm Management,...|$|R
6000|$|Inside of {{half an hour}} Link Merwell and Job Haskers gained all the {{information}} they desired. They learned that the three men were Sol Blugg and his cohorts. The wounded man was Staver, {{and he had been}} shot through the hand by Tom Dillon. He was very angry and willing to do almost anything <b>to</b> <b>square</b> <b>accounts.</b> The men were sure that the Dillon party and the Blower party were on the trail of a new find of gold and wanted to get in [...] "on the ground floor," [...] as they expressed it.|$|E
6000|$|... "They want <b>to</b> <b>square</b> <b>accounts</b> for the {{football}} defeat," [...] said Fred. [...] "Well, {{the only thing}} to do is to accept the challenge," [...] and the acceptance was sent without delay, the game to be played on the Putnam Hall grounds, Captain Putnam having promised the cadets his aid in building a grandstand. The lumber came out of a boathouse that had been torn down to make place for a new structure, and as many of the cadets took to carpentering naturally, the grandstand was quite a creditable affair.|$|E
60|$|Author. It {{would be}} base {{to do so}} exclusively, or even {{to make it a}} {{principal}} motive for literary exertion. Nay, I will venture to say, that no work of imagination, proceeding from the mere consideration of a certain sum of copy-money, ever did, or ever will, succeed. So the lawyer who pleads, the soldier who fights, the physician who prescribes, the clergyman--if such there be--who preaches, without any zeal for his profession, or without any sense of its dignity, and merely on account of the fee, pay, or stipend, degrade themselves to the rank of sordid mechanics. Accordingly, in the case of two of the learned faculties at least, their services are considered as unappreciable, and are acknowledged, not by any exact estimate of the services rendered, but by a honorarium, or voluntary acknowledgment. But let a client or patient make the experiment of omitting this little ceremony of the honorarium, which is cense to be a thing entirely out of consideration between them, and mark how the learned gentleman will look upon his case. Cant set apart, it is the same thing with literary emolument. No man of sense, in any rank of life, is, or ought to be, above accepting a just recompense for his time, and a reasonable share of the capital which owes its very existence to his exertions. When Czar Peter wrought in the trenches, he took the pay of a common soldier; and nobles, statesmen, and divines, the most distinguished of their time, have not scorned <b>to</b> <b>square</b> <b>accounts</b> with their bookseller.|$|E
