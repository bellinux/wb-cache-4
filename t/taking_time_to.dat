5|$|A PlayStation {{version was}} in {{development}} and {{scheduled for release}} in summer 2001, and a Dreamcast version in late 2001. Both were cancelled. PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions were due for release in 2002. Versions for the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance were proposed, but never materialised. A company called M4 was to have co-developed them alongside Lionhead, but Electronic Arts {{were not interested in}} the Game Boy versions. Molyneux stated that the Dreamcast version was cancelled because it was <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> convert the game for the platform, and development had not progressed far enough for it to be worth continuing as interest in the platform was declining.|$|E
25|$|Like {{a number}} of other theories, the Multiple Drafts model understands {{conscious}} experience as <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> occur, such that percepts do not instantaneously arise in the mind in their full richness. The distinction is that Dennett's theory denies any clear and unambiguous boundary separating conscious experiences from all other processing. According to Dennett, consciousness {{is to be found in}} the actions and flows of information from place to place, rather than some singular view containing our experience. There is no central experiencer who confers a durable stamp of approval on any particular draft.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Jackson was not {{advancing}} as Lee had planned. He was <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> rebuild bridges {{over the}} Chickahominy and {{he received a}} garbled order from Lee's chief of staff that made him believe he should stay north {{of the river and}} guard the crossings. These failures of the Confederate plan were being matched on the Union side, however. Heintzelman decided on his own that his corps was not needed to defend Savage's Station, Sumner's and Franklin's being sufficient, so he decided to follow the rest of the army without informing his fellow generals.|$|E

25|$|Naved Arif {{signed for}} Rawtenstall Cricket Club in the Lancashire League during the 2010 season. Arif was largely {{described}} as a big success despite <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{come to terms with}} English conditions. Arif took 64 wickets during the season with an average of 18.00 and a best of 8–35 against Lowerhouse Cricket Club. He was also a useful run scorer for the club. He scored 769 runs at 40.5 with 5 half centuries. It was at Rawtenstall CC that Arif was given his nickname 'Barry' (as in the Great Barry Arif) a nickname that was adopted by his next club, Sussex CCC.|$|E
25|$|That same year, {{the comedy}} Junior was released, {{the last of}} Schwarzenegger's three collaborations with Ivan Reitman and again co-starring Danny DeVito. This film brought him his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for Best Actor– Musical or Comedy. It was {{followed}} by the action thriller Eraser (1996), the Christmas comedy Jingle All The Way (1996), and the comic book-based Batman & Robin (1997), in which he played the villain Mr. Freeze. This was his final film before <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> recuperate from a back injury. Following the critical failure of Batman & Robin, his film career and box office prominence went into decline. He returned with the supernatural thriller End of Days (1999), later followed by the action films The 6th Day (2000) and Collateral Damage (2002), both of which failed to do well at the box office. In 2003, he made his third appearance as the title character in , which went on to earn over $150million domestically.|$|E

He distinguished the styles of each band, writing: [...] "Anthrax has a more lighthearted, fun approach, while Megadeth is 100 percent business with very little banter {{and focus on the}} music. Slayer has a more ominous vibe, although their evil mystique has lessened over the years. Metallica were very inclusive, with James Hetfield acting as everybody's favorite uncle interacting with the crowd and <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> soak it all in." ...|$|E

500|$|Stuttgart manager Joachim Löw was {{disappointed}} with the defeat, but remained confident about his future at the team, {{as well as the}} season: [...] "I'm calmly looking forward to the discussion. The club has to approach me. I have a contract until 1999. There must be some tough words. For me, the season has been positive". His word was also shared by Bobic who felt that his team were treated unfairly to the goal, also <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> defend Löw: [...] "We need to talk about mistakes and learn from them, {{it does not mean that}} it is necessary to change the manager". He added: [...] "It is bitter to lose by such a goal". However, Verlaat dissented, and criticised Stuttgart's campaign: [...] "The club has to make up its mind finally. We could have done better this season. We carelessly squandered about eight games". Yakin agreed and offered his own comments: [...] "You have to talk about many things, you cannot work together in the way it was this year." ...|$|E
500|$|Harsh {{restrictions}} were imposed on Prussia, {{such as a}} massive indemnity of one hundred and twenty million francs and the quartering of troops. At the time, one hundred and twenty million francs was equivalent to the entire yearly budget of Prussia. As the perceived symbol of Prussia's former grandeur and pride, the French occupation of Prussia had a particularly devastating effect upon Louise, as the queen endured personal insults– Napoleon himself callously called her [...] "the only real man in Prussia". The queen recognized that her adopted country depended on her for moral strength, {{and as a consequence}} Louise regained her old sense of optimism, often <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> prepare their eldest son for his future role as king. In the following few years Louise supported the reforming efforts of government carried out by Stein and Hardenberg, {{as well as those of}} Gerhard von Scharnhorst and August Neidhardt von Gneisenau, to reorganize the army. After the disaster at Tilsit, Louise was instrumental in Stein's reappointment (the king had previously dismissed him), telling Frederick William [...] " [...] is my last hope.

500|$|After [...] "composed performances" [...] {{on trial}} in pre-season, Courtney signed a one-year {{contract}} with Conference Premier club Kidderminster Harriers on 20 July 2009. He made his debut as a substitute in the 66th minute of a 1–0 victory over Hayes & Yeading United on 8 August 2009, which was followed by his first start in a 1–0 defeat to Salisbury City on 11 August due to Liam Dolman not being fit. He played against Tamworth on 31 August 2009 despite an injury and although he was still suffering this injury {{he was able to}} play in the next match, a 2–0 defeat to Eastbourne Borough. Courtney commented in September 2009 that Kidderminster's defence was <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> gel, saying [...] "We've all played at a high standard, individually and collectively we are good, but there's something missing. I think it's communication between us, which is why we're making mistakes." [...] His first and only goal for Kidderminster came with a low shot at Kettering Town in a 2–0 victory on 21 November 2009 and manager Mark Yates said [...] "It was a good finish by Duane, he does it in training quite often". He played for Kidderminster in their run to the FA Trophy semi-final, in which they were beaten 5–1 on aggregate by Stevenage Borough. Courtney suffered an ankle injury against Cambridge United on 30 March 2010 and returned in the following match against Altrincham on 3 April, in which he was forced to be substituted due to his ankle. He did not miss any further playing time as he featured in the following match, a 1–1 draw with Rushden & Diamonds on 5 April 2010. He finished 2009–10 with 49 appearances and 1 goal for Kidderminster.|$|E

500|$|Reviewing {{the first}} seven episodes, Brian Lowry of Variety said, the season begins [...] "on an uneven note", {{comparing}} {{some of the early}} moments to the works of Sam Peckinpah, [...] "complete with slow-motion bullets and blood sprays. Stick with it, though, and the show blossoms, featuring a few terrific action sequences while introducing into this grim world seminal characters the Punisher and Elektra." [...] Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush felt {{the first seven}} episodes of the season seemed [...] "to have learned the best of both" [...] from season one and Jessica Jones, [...] "placing its most compelling imagery front and center straightaway, but still <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> pick apart the characters beneath them, rather than shout platitudes about saving the city." [...] He also praised the castings of Bernthal and Yung as Punisher and Elektra, respectively, and enjoyed [...] "the improved spotlight" [...] for Foggy and Karen, given the reduction of Dawson saying, [...] "So many superhero series struggle to draw its supporting characters as compellingly as the action, and Daredevils particular blend of set piece and legal thriller feels inescapably original." [...] However, Fitzpatrick did note the series lacked the presence Vondie Curtis-Hall brought as Ben Urich in the first season. He concluded that the season's progression [...] "feels much cleaner" [...] than the first's, [...] "moving almost in acts more than back and forth victories...Even the aim feels that much more cohesive, to start in a place of Matt, Foggy and Karen all confident in their new roles, but wrestling with the consequence of their choice to always help the helpless." [...] Merrill Barr of Forbes said, [...] "Daredevil season two is very much the same excellent show Daredevil season one was...but in the places it isn’t, it’s also very much improved". Barr praised Bernthal as the Punisher, and noted the reduction in the amount of [...] "thick blacks" [...] in the cinematography that the first season was criticized for.|$|E
500|$|In {{comparison}} to Cliff, Clair {{is usually the}} tougher and more sensible parent, offering her children legitimate advice that they can actually apply to their everyday lives; it remains clear to audiences that Clair runs the household. AskMen's Geoffrey Lansdell agreed that the character [...] "rel on a sly maternal quality that fed off of Bill Cosby’s silly paternal playfulness". However, there are occasionally times when Clair resorts to the [...] "wait till your father gets home" [...] method of disciplining her children. Clair generally supports her children's decisions and ever-changing ambitions, specifically in regards to schooling, marriage and careers. Both Clair and Cliff value the importance of proper education in their children's lives, appearing proudest when they {{do well in school}} and delivering the most serious punishments when they underperform academically. On one occasion, Theo rebels against his parents' high expectations of him, arguing, [...] "Because of what you two have achieved, the whole world expects a lot more from us than other kids. Let’s face it, there’s nowhere else left for us to go but down," [...] a statement Clair immediately reprimands him for making. When it comes to parenting, Clair usually maintains [...] "an allure of cool, calm confidence ... exhibit a strong but gentle parenting stance, one that wasn’t seen on television by a woman of color" [...] at the time, according to Global Grind's Desire Thompson. Clair practices disciplining her children without ever punishing them physically, often delivering punishments [...] "with a calm charm", and raises her four daughters to love and respect themselves. However, she is also known for ranting at her children when she loses her temper, one of her most recognizable of which is the one she gives Vanessa when she attends a concert in Baltimore against her parents' wishes. In the Season 3 episode [...] "The Shower", Denise hosts a wedding shower for a close friend who gets pregnant on purpose to blackmail her parents into letting her marry her fiancé as soon as possible. When Denise broaches the subject of how she would handle a similar situation, Clair sternly – but rather comically – insists that she will never find herself in a similar situation. Despite her seriousness and disciplinarian status, Clair seldom shies away from laughing and participating in fun activities alongside her family as opposed to simply observing them from the sidelines. The character is also fond of relaxing and <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> herself away from her children whenever necessary.|$|E
