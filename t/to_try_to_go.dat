Buscopan is sometimes used to facilitate rectal examination and {{reduce the risk of}} tears, because it decreases the smooth muscle tone of the gastrointestinal tract, but can be contraindicated and will produce a very rapid heart rate. Because the rectum is relatively fragile, the risk of rectal tears is always present whenever an examination is performed. Severe rectal tears often result in death or euthanasia. However, the diagnostic benefits of a rectal examination almost always outweigh these risks.|$|E
500|$|Surprised by {{the news}} of a Matabele mission to London, Rhodes {{attempted}} to publicly downplay the credentials of the izinDuna and {{to stop them from}} leaving Africa. When the envoys reached Kimberley Rhodes told his close friend, associate and housemate Dr Leander Starr Jameson—who himself held the rank of inDuna, having been so honoured by Lobengula years before as thanks for medical treatment—to invite Maund to their cottage. Maund was suspicious, but came anyway. At the cottage, Rhodes offered Maund financial and professional incentives to defect from the London syndicate. Maund refused, prompting Rhodes to declare furiously that he would have Robinson stop his progress at Cape Town. The izinDuna reached Cape Town in mid-January 1889 to find that it was as Rhodes had said; to delay their departure, Robinson discredited them, Maund and Colenbrander in cables to the Colonial Office in London, saying that Shippard had described Maund as [...] "mendacious" [...] and [...] "dangerous", Colenbrander as [...] "hopelessly unreliable", and Babayane and Mshete as not actually izinDuna or even headmen. Cawston forlornly telegraphed Maund that it was pointless <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on while Robinson continued in this vein.|$|E

In response, Webb told reporters that if Ronald Reagan had made any speeches about Allen his opponent's campaign would probably use them, too.

"There {{is nothing}} very strange in that," [...] he replied; [...] "a {{schoolmaster}} usually becomes very {{well acquainted with}} some of his scholars, and if a girl pleases him very much {{it is not surprising that}} he should prefer to marry her, or, at least, <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to,</b> than <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out among comparative strangers to look for a wife." ...|$|R

2500|$|The New Girl {{production}} {{offices are}} on the Fox lot in Los Angeles, next to those of Homeland. New Girl had 11 writers during its first season and 15 during the second season, half of them male. Stories are developed in a collaborative effort and are aimed at viewers of all genders. The first season had no planned story arcs, but focused on setting up the characters, while the second season was to show different sides of the characters. Overarching storylines usually culminate at a season's end; the actors are generally not told the ending. Meriwether said the writers did not [...] "have a lot of plans. I think we really just <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> where the show wants to go." [...] The writers challenge themselves to create new stories and to change the show's dynamics to keep things fresh, while aiming to be [...] "as emotionally real as possible" [...] with [...] "Every story having to feel like it was grounded in some emotional arc as opposed to going from the joke into the story." [...] As the show's jokes rely on the actors' performance instead of perfectly constructed punch lines, Meriwether looks for the actors' strengths before writing. The A story generally revolves around Jess and has an emotional core. Still, Meriwether sees the show as an ensemble about friendship with [...] "everybody having their own stories and people being interested {{in all of the}} characters." ...|$|E

60|$|Peter Rabbit was in trouble. He had {{got into}} {{mischief}} and now, like everyone who gets into mischief, he wished that he hadn't.

Why, in the stone wall on one side of Farmer Brown's young peach orchard. How Peter blessed the old stone wall in which he had found a safe hiding-place!

60|$|And besides--this, remember, is {{the place}} and the moment of {{perfectly}} open talk--I think that all ambitions are lawful except those which climb upward on the miseries or credulities of mankind. All intellectual and artistic ambitions are permissible, up to and even beyond the limit of prudent sanity. They can hurt no one. If they are mad, then so much the worse for the artist. Indeed, as virtue is said to be, such ambitions are their own reward. Is it such a very mad presumption {{to believe in the}} sovereign power of one's art, to try for other means, for other ways of affirming this belief in the deeper appeal of one's work? <b>To</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> deeper is not to be insensible. A historian of hearts is not a historian of emotions, yet he penetrates further, restrained as he may be, since his aim is to reach the very fount of laughter and tears. The sight of human affairs deserves admiration and pity. They are worthy of respect, too. And he is not insensible who pays them the undemonstrative tribute of a sigh which is not a sob, and of a smile which is not a grin. Resignation, not mystic, not detached, but resignation open-eyed, conscious, and informed by love, {{is the only one of}} our feelings for which it is impossible to become a sham.|$|E
