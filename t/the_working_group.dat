5|$|Another legacy was the Arbeitsstab Wiederaufbau zerstörter Städte (Working {{group on}} Reconstruction of {{destroyed}} cities), authorized by Speer in 1943 to rebuild bombed German cities {{to make them}} more livable {{in the age of the}} automobile. Headed by Wolters, <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>group</b> took a possible military defeat into their calculations. The Arbeitsstabs recommendations served as the basis of the postwar redevelopment plans in many cities, and Arbeitsstab members became prominent in the rebuilding.|$|E
5|$|Fleischmann and Weissmandl's rescue group, <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Group,</b> {{devised a}} more ambitious {{proposal}} in November that year. Known as the Europa plan or Grossplan, {{the aim was}} to bribe the SS with money from Jews overseas, primarily the United States, to stop the deportation of all Jews to Poland. Various sums have been mentioned in connection with this, including $2–3 million. Nothing came of it, reportedly because Heinrich Himmler intervened in August 1943.|$|E
5|$|On a {{fence in}} front of the wall, there were {{memorial}} crosses with the names and date of death on them. However, since the government moved to Berlin, the white crosses had to be relocated in 1995 from {{the eastern side of the}} Reichstag. The new location is on the west side of the building at a fence of the Tiergarten. 2003, Wolfgang Thierse inaugurated a new memorial designed by Jan Wehberg with the same name as the one on Reichstagufer. On seven both-sided inscribed crosses are the names of the 13 deaths. Another memorial of the Civil Association was in Bernauer Straße. Other victims are remembered through commemorative plates embedded in sidewalks and other installations which are nearby their death spot. On October 2004, <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Group</b> 13 August built the Freedom Memorial at Checkpoint Charlie. It reminds people of the victims of the Berlin Wall and the inner German border with 1067 crosses. The memorial had to be removed after about half a year because the landowners terminated the lease with <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E

5|$|These {{criteria}} {{restricted the}} field of potential target areas. It was decided that the target should be in Hubble's 'continuous viewing zones' (CVZs)—the areas of sky which are not occulted by the Earth or the moon during Hubble's orbit. <b>The</b> <b>working</b> <b>group</b> decided {{to concentrate on the}} northern CVZ, so that northern-hemisphere telescopes such as the Keck telescopes, the Kitt Peak National Observatory telescopes and the Very Large Array (VLA) could conduct follow-up observations.|$|E
5|$|Rio de Janeiro was {{primarily}} evaluated during the Applicant phase, accurately on March 14, 2008, when the IOC Working Group released its report {{after four days}} of meetings, giving a weighted-average score of 6.4 to the bid. It {{was based on a}} thorough technical analysis of the projects presented on the Application File, which was developed by the Rio de Janeiro bid committee after having access to the Olympic Games Knowledge Management database as well as the official IOC Technical Manuals. <b>The</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Group</b> composed of several experts assessed the city's potential for staging successful Olympic Games according to eleven criteria presented in the Application File. Rio de Janeiro's highest score came from Government support, legal issues and public opinion due to the strong government commitment, and its lowest from Safety and security due to the city's chronic problems of violence. Experience in major events also yielded good scores, while a shortage in the number of required hotel rooms undermined the accommodation theme. <b>The</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Group</b> also gave an 8.3 score to Tokyo, 8.1 to Madrid, 7.0 to Chicago, 6.9 to Doha, 5.3 to Prague and 4.3 to Baku; being the basis for the selection to the Candidature phase. On September 18, 2008, after the shortlist which concluded the Application phase, the IOC announced the composition of its Evaluation Commission. The commission inspected the four Candidate cities under the leadership of Nawal El Moutawakel, who also chaired the Evaluation Commission for the bid process of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics.|$|E
5|$|The AKC {{accepted}} {{registration of}} the new breed in 1926, two years after Miniature Schnauzers {{were introduced to the}} United States. They were originally known as Wirehaired Pinschers. International Kennel Club classifications vary; in the United Kingdom and Australia they fall within the Utility Group, while in Canada they are in <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Group.</b> In the AKC the Miniature Schnauzer is classed with the terriers. It was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1948 and also classed as a terrier. The start of the modern Miniature Schnauzer is generally considered to begin with Ch. Dorem Display, the first Miniature Schnauzer to win Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. He was born 5 April 1945 and lived to be nearly fourteen. Almost every living Miniature Schnauzer in America can trace its lineage back to Dorem Display.|$|E

5|$|The {{dispute over}} who had {{actually}} discovered the object delayed {{the acceptance of}} any name, or of formal classification of the object as a dwarf planet. On 17 September 2008, the IAU announced that the two bodies in charge of naming dwarf planets, the Committee on Small Body Nomenclature (CSBN) and <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Group</b> for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN), had decided on the Caltech proposal of Haumea. At the CSBN, {{the outcome of the}} voting was very close, eventually being decided by a single vote. However, the date of the discovery was listed on the announcement as March 7, 2003, the location of discovery as the Sierra Nevada Observatory, {{and the name of the}} discoverer was left blank.|$|E
5|$|The only internationally {{recognized}} authority for naming celestial bodies is the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The International Astronomical Union maintains <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Group</b> on Star Names (WGSN) which catalogs and standardizes proper names for stars. A number of private companies sell names of stars, which the British Library calls an unregulated commercial enterprise. The IAU has disassociated itself from this commercial practice, and these names are neither {{recognized by the}} IAU, professional astronomers, nor the amateur astronomy community. One such star-naming company is the International Star Registry, which, during the 1980s, was accused of deceptive practice for making it appear that the assigned name was official. This now-discontinued ISR practice was informally labeled a scam and a fraud, and the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs issued a violation against ISR for engaging in a deceptive trade practice.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of 1940, {{following}} the rising tension between the Soviet Union and Germany over territories in the Balkans, an eventual invasion of the Soviet Union seemed to Hitler {{to be the only}} solution. While no concrete plans were made yet, Hitler told one of his generals in June that the victories in Western Europe finally freed his hands for his important real task: the showdown with Bolshevism. With the successful end to the campaign in France, General Erich Marcks was assigned to <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>group</b> drawing up the initial invasion plans of the Soviet Union. The first battle plans were entitled Operation Draft East (but colloquially it was known as the Marcks Plan). His report advocated the A-A line to be the operational objective of any invasion of the Soviet Union. This goal would extend from northern city of Arkhangelsk on the Arctic Sea through Gorky and Rostov to the port city of Astrakhan {{at the mouth of the}} Volga on the Caspian Sea. The report concluded that this military border would reduce the threat to Germany (and the Third Reich) from attacks by enemy bombers.|$|E

Weightings, varying between 1 and 5 (5 being the highest), were attributed by <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Group</b> to each criterion, reflecting the level of information requested of the Applicant Cities {{at this stage of}} the bid process, and the potential of achieving the level required for the organisation of the Olympic Games in the seven years' preparation time. <b>The</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Group</b> set the benchmark at 6 as minimum required grade (on a scale of 0 to 10).
