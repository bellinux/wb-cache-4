500|$|The cover artwork shows a photograph, {{taken at}} Easington Colliery, {{of the band}} {{apparently}} having just urinated on a large concrete piling protruding from a slag heap. The decision to shoot the picture came from Entwistle and Moon discussing Stanley Kubrick and the film [...] According to photographer Ethan Russell, most of the band members were unable to urinate, so rainwater was tipped from an empty film canister to achieve the desired effect. <b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>cover</b> showed the band backstage at De Montfort Hall, Leicester, amongst a debris of furniture. [...] In 2003, the television channel VH1 named Who's Nexts cover {{one of the greatest}} album covers of all time.|$|E

500|$|The G2's {{exterior}} {{consists of}} a polycarbonate shell—unlike its predecessor, which used a glass-based construction. <b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>cover</b> is adorned with a subtle pattern resembling carbon fiber. The G2's volume and power keys are located directly below the camera on {{the rear of the}} device. The power button contains an LED lamp, which {{can be used as a}} notification light. The positioning of the buttons on the rear deviates from the majority of smartphones, where they are located on the bezel (side edge) of the phone. LG argued that buttons located on the bezel were harder to reach on larger smartphones, and made it more likely for users to drop their phone when adjusting the volume during a call. As such, the G2's buttons are instead located where the index finger would normally lie when the phone is held. Alongside the power button, the G2 is also [...] powered on by double-tapping on the screen, and turned off by double-tapping on the status bar or a blank area on the home screen, a feature branded as [...] "KnockOn". When the phone is off, the volume keys can also be used to launch directly into the camera or QuickMemo applications by holding them down.|$|E
500|$|The {{cover sleeve}} and images were shot by Ellen von Unwerth. The cover was {{released}} by Jive Records on October 12, 2007. It features Spears sporting black hair and wearing a pink (blue in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>cover)</b> dress, and a white fedora. A reviewer for the Ottawa Citizen felt the design was [...] "horrendous". The centerfold pictures feature Spears and a priest in suggestive poses in a confessional. The first image shows Spears, who wears a cross and fishnet stockings, sitting on the priest's lap, while in the second one she leans suggestively against the confessional with the priest sitting {{on the other side}} of the partition. After the album was released, the Catholic League's director of communications Kiera McCaffrey stated that the group considered the photos a [...] "cheap publicity stunt" [...] to promote the album and condemned Spears for [...] "mocking a Catholic sacrament". McCaffrey added: [...] "All we see is how troubled this girl is now, especially with her family, losing her kids, with her career on a downward slide. And now she's put out this album and this is her tactic to promote it?" [...] Gil Kaufman of MTV said that the images were reminiscent of Madonna's music video for [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] (1989). The booklet also contains pictures of empty chairs with ripped tabloid pages and still images from the music video for [...] "Gimme More". The album doesn't include a thank-you list, unlike her previous albums.|$|E
500|$|The {{first issue}} of Fantastic was impressive, with a cover that sf {{historian}} Mike Ashley has described as [...] "one of the most captivating of all first issues"; the painting, by Barye Phillips and Leo Summers, illustrated Kris Neville's [...] "The Opal Necklace". [...] The fiction included some stories by well known names; in particular, Raymond Chandler's [...] "Professor Bingo's Snuff" [...] would have caught readers' eyes—the story had appeared the year before in Park East magazine, but would have been new to most readers. [...] It was a short mystery in which the fantasy element was invisibility, achieved by magical snuff. [...] Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury also contributed stories, and the issue led with [...] "Six and Ten Are Johnny", by Walter M. Miller. [...] <b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>cover</b> reprinted Pierre Roy's painting [...] "Danger on the Stairs", which depicted a snake on a staircase; {{it was an odd}} choice, but subsequent back covers were more natural fits for a fantasy magazine. [...] The quality of the fiction continued to be high for the first year; sf historian Mike Ashley comments that almost every story in the first seven issues was of high quality, and historian David Kyle regards it as an [...] "outstandingly successful experiment". Science fiction bibliographer Donald Tuck dissents, however, regarding the first few years as containing [...] "little of note", and James Blish wrote a contemporary review of the second issue which found it lacking: Blish dismissed three of the seven stories in the Fall 1952 issue as being essentially crime stories written for the sf market, and commented that of the remaining four, only two were [...] "reasonably competent and craftsmanlike".|$|E

500|$|Several {{photographs}} were considered as candidates {{for a single}} cover image, including shots of: a cow on an Irish farm in County Kildare; the nude Clayton; and the band driving a Trabant, an East German automobile they became fond of as a symbol for a changing Europe. Ultimately, a multiple image scheme was used, as U2, Corbijn, Averill, and the producers thought that [...] "the sense of flux expressed by both {{the music and the}} band's playing with alter egos was best articulated by the lack of a single viewpoint". The resulting front sleeve is a 4×4 squared montage. A mix of Corbijn's original images from Berlin and the later photo shoots was used, as the band wanted to balance the [...] "colder European feel of the mainly black-and-white Berlin images with the much warmer exotic climates of Santa Cruz and Morocco". Some {{photographs were}} used because they were striking on their own, while others were used because of their ambiguity. Images of the band with Trabants, several of which were painted bright colours, appear on the sleeve and throughout the album booklet. These vehicles were later incorporated into the Zoo TV Tour set design as part of the lighting system. The nude photo of Clayton was placed on <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>cover</b> of the record. On the US compact disc and cassette sleeves, Clayton's genitals are censored with a black [...] "X" [...] or a four-leaf clover, while vinyl editions feature the photo uncensored. The label of the physical CD and vinyl record features an image of a [...] "babyface" [...] graffitied by artist Charlie Whisker onto an external wall of Windmill Lane Studios. The babyface image was later adopted as a logo for Zoo TV Tour memorabilia and was incorporated into the Zooropa album cover. In 2003, music television network VH1 ranked Achtung Babys sleeve at number 39 on its list of the [...] "50 Greatest Album Covers". Bono has called the sleeve his favourite U2 cover artwork.|$|E
