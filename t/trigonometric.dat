5|$|The phase-amplitude {{converter}} {{creates the}} sample-domain waveform from the truncated phase output word {{received from the}} PA. The PAC can be a simple read only memory containing 2M contiguous samples of the desired output waveform which typically is a sinusoid. Often though, various tricks are employed {{to reduce the amount}} of memory required. This include various <b>trigonometric</b> expansions, <b>trigonometric</b> approximations and methods which take advantage of the quadrature symmetry exhibited by sinusoids. Alternatively, the PAC may consist of random access memory which can be filled as desired to create an arbitrary waveform generator.|$|E
5|$|To fit {{the program}} into the 320 words {{available}} on the chip, some significant modification was used. By not using regular floating point numbers, which require lots of instructions to keep the decimal point in the right place, some space was freed up. <b>Trigonometric</b> functions were implemented in about 40 instructions, and inverse <b>trigonometric</b> functions are almost 30 more instructions. Logarithms are about 40 instructions, with anti-log about 20 on top of that. The code to normalize and display the computed values are roughly the same in both the TI and Sinclair programs.|$|E
5|$|Algebraic {{operations}} {{can be done}} readily on {{the power}} series representation; for instance, Euler's formula follows from Taylor series expansions for <b>trigonometric</b> and exponential functions. This result is of fundamental importance in such fields as harmonic analysis.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in {{practice}} {{one wants to}} approximate the function with {{a finite number of}} terms, say with a Taylor polynomial or a partial sum of the <b>trigonometric</b> series, respectively. In the case of the Taylor series the error is very small in a neighbourhood of the point where it is computed, while it may be very large at a distant point. In the case of the Fourier series the error is distributed along the domain of the function.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th century, the {{earliest}} {{examples of the}} use of Taylor series and closely related methods were given by Madhava of Sangamagrama. Though no record of his work survives, writings of later Indian mathematicians suggest that he found a number of special cases of the Taylor series, including those for the <b>trigonometric</b> functions of sine, cosine, tangent, and arctangent. The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics further expanded his works with various series expansions and rational approximations until the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{distance}} to Beta Pictoris {{and many other}} stars {{was measured by the}} Hipparcos satellite. This was done by measuring its <b>trigonometric</b> parallax: the slight displacement in its position observed as the Earth moves around the Sun. Beta Pictoris was found to exhibit a parallax of 51.87 milliarcseconds, a value which was later revised to 51.44 milliarcseconds when the data was reanalyzed taking systematic errors more carefully into account. The {{distance to}} Beta Pictoris is therefore 63.4 light years, with an uncertainty of 0.1 light years.|$|E
5|$|The {{functionality}} of calculator ICs {{increased at}} a rapid pace and Roberts was designing and producing new models. The MITS 7400 scientific and engineering calculator was introduced in December 1972. It featured <b>trigonometric</b> functions, polar to rectangular conversion, two memories, and up to a seven-level stack. A kit with a three-level stack was $299.95 and an assembled unit with a seven-level stack was $419.95. The next month the Series 1200 four-function pocket calculators were announced. The six-digit model was $59.95 and the twelve-digit model was $99.95.|$|E
5|$|Euler also {{pioneered the}} use of {{analytic}} methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic <b>trigonometric</b> functions and the analytic theory of continued fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's {{work in this area}} {{led to the development of}} the prime number theorem.|$|E
5|$|The Kerala {{school of}} {{astronomy}} and mathematics flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries. In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently created {{a number of}} important mathematics concepts, including series expansion for <b>trigonometric</b> functions. Following the instructions of the Wood's despatch of 1854, both the princely states, Travancore and Cochin, launched mass education drives with support from agencies, mainly based on castes and communities and introduced a system of grant-in-aid to attract more private initiatives. The efforts by leaders, Vaikunda Swami, Narayana Guru, Ayyankali and Kuriakose Elias Chavara towards aiding the socially discriminated castes in the state, with the help of community-based organisations like Nair Service Society, SNDP, Muslim Mahajana Sabha, Yoga Kshema Sabha (of Nambudiris) and congregations of Christian churches, {{led to the development of}} mass education in Kerala.|$|E

Inverse <b>trigonometric</b> functions are widely used in engineering, navigation, physics, and geometry.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trigonometric</b> {{functions}} of inverse <b>trigonometric</b> functions are tabulated below. A {{quick way to}} derive them is by considering the geometry of a right-angled triangle, with one side of length 1, and another side of length x (any real number between 0 and 1), then applying the Pythagorean theorem and definitions of the <b>trigonometric</b> ratios.

25|$|Other {{forms of}} {{interpolation}} {{can be constructed}} by picking a different class of interpolants.

Another possibility is to use wavelets.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, the <b>trigonometric</b> {{functions}} (also called circular functions, angle functions or goniometric functions) are {{functions of}} an angle.

25|$|A {{number of}} authors, notably Jean le Rond d'Alembert, and Carl Friedrich Gauss used <b>trigonometric</b> series {{to study the}} heat equation, but the {{breakthrough}} development was the 1807 paper Mémoire sur la propagation de la chaleur dans les corps solides by Joseph Fourier, whose crucial insight was to model all functions by <b>trigonometric</b> series, introducing the Fourier series.|$|E

25|$|If sin(nx) and cos(nx) are {{expanded}} {{in terms of}} sin(x) and cos(x), a <b>trigonometric</b> polynomial becomes a polynomial in the two variables sin(x) and cos(x) (using List of <b>trigonometric</b> identities#Multiple-angle formulae). Conversely, every polynomial in sin(x) and cos(x) may be converted, with Product-to-sum identities, into a linear combination of functions sin(nx) and cos(nx). This equivalence explains why linear combinations are called polynomials.|$|E
25|$|Elementary proofs {{of these}} {{relations}} proceed via expansion to exponential {{forms of the}} <b>trigonometric</b> functions.|$|E
