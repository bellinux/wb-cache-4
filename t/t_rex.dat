5|$|Two {{scenes from}} the book were {{ultimately}} excised, with Spielberg removing the opening sequence with Procompsognathus attacking a young child as he previously found it too horrific, and Koepp cutting for budgetary reasons the <b>T.</b> <b>rex</b> chasing Grant and the children down a river before being tranquilized by Muldoon. Both parts eventually saw inclusion in the film sequels. Spielberg suggested {{the addition of the}} scene where the <b>T.</b> <b>rex</b> pursues a jeep, which at first would only have the characters driving away after listening to the dinosaur's footsteps.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle between}} Kong {{and the final}} V. rex is almost move-for-move like {{the last half of}} the fight between Kong and the <b>T.</b> <b>rex</b> in the 1933 film, right down to Kong playing with the dinosaur's broken jaw and then standing, beating his chest and roaring victoriously.|$|E
5|$|The {{boys and}} Candace {{return to a}} muddy area where the <b>T.</b> <b>rex</b> has left a massive footprint, which they {{recognize}} will eventually be {{on display in the}} museum in the present. Phineas leaves a message in the footprint for Isabella and the Fireside Girls to save them. The girls—in the present—immediately spot the footprint and the message and follow their handbook to create a new time machine. They use the machine to travel back in time and rescue the three. Upon arrival in the present, though, they realize a <b>T.</b> <b>rex</b> returned with them, so Candace flees and tries to expose it to her parents. A stray ray from Doofenshmirtz's machine freezes the creature, so her parents merely believe it is an exhibit.|$|E
50|$|Like all of <b>T.</b> <b>Rex's</b> music, {{the song}} is written by Marc Bolan.|$|R
5000|$|... "I Love to Boogie" [...] is amongst <b>T.</b> <b>Rex's</b> {{best known}} and most popular hits.|$|R

5|$|Different endings are {{possible}} {{based on the}} choice the player makes. The endings all involve a battle with the <b>T.</b> <b>rex</b> and escaping the island via a watercraft or helicopter. Regina survives in all endings but depending on the ending, other characters may die. If Regina chases Kirk, Gail reveals that the whole mission was a front and {{the government did not}} want Kirk, but instead wanted the Third Energy to use in warfare.|$|E
5|$|The first festival at Worthy Farm was the Pilton Pop, Blues & Folk Festival, mounted by Michael Eavis on Saturday 19 September 1970, and {{attended}} by 1,500 people. The original headline acts were The Kinks and Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders but these acts were replaced {{at short notice}} by Tyrannosaurus Rex, later known as <b>T.</b> <b>Rex.</b> Tickets were £1. Other billed acts of note were Quintessence, Stackridge, and Al Stewart.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} soundtrack {{album was}} announced on October 16, 2013, {{and it was}} released digitally on October 29, 2013, by the Relativity Music Group. The soundtrack album featured various artists, include Leto's band Thirty Seconds to Mars, Tegan and Sara, Awolnation, The Naked and Famous, <b>T.</b> <b>Rex,</b> My Morning Jacket, Fitz and The Tantrums, Blondfire, Neon Trees, Cold War Kids, Capital Cities, The Airborne Toxic Event, and more. It was announced that 40 cents of every sale of album at iTunes {{would go to the}} AIDS relief charity Project Red's Global Fund.|$|E

5000|$|Rolling Stone {{described}} Manson's crooning on {{the title}} track, [...] "Mechanical Animals", as evocative of [...] "the sultry vibe of <b>T.</b> <b>Rex's</b> Marc Bolan".|$|R
5000|$|The {{track was}} {{produced}} by the band's manager Nils Stevenson and Mike Stavrou, a recording engineer on <b>T.</b> <b>Rex's</b> final album, Dandy in the Underworld (1977) ...|$|R
5|$|Gallimimus are {{featured}} in a stampede scene where {{one of them is}} devoured by the Tyrannosaurus. The Gallimimus was the first dinosaur to receive a digital version, being featured in two ILM tests, first as a herd of skeletons and then fully skinned while pursued by the <b>T.</b> <b>rex.</b> Its design was based on ostriches, and to emphasize the birdlike qualities, the animation focused mostly on the herd rather than individual animals. As reference for the dinosaurs' run, the animators were filmed running at the ILM parking lot, with plastic pipes standing in as the tree that the Gallimimus jump over. The footage even inspired to incorporate an animal falling in its leap as one of the artists crashed making the jump. Horse squeals became the Gallimimus sounds.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} follows Gail, they go after an unknown man, but end up losing him. Rick then tells Regina that Tom's dead. If the player follows Rick, they come across Tom, badly injured and near death. Rick takes {{him to the}} medical room, however a Velociraptor attacks them, but Tom sacrifices himself to kill it and save Rick. Later, Regina and the team manage to locate Kirk and {{apprehend}} him. As they are preparing to leave via helicopter, the <b>T.</b> <b>rex</b> returns and destroys the helicopter, forcing them to flee back into the base while Kirk manages to escape. Regina and Rick flee into the facility and locate keys to a watercraft, but find a vortex {{in the way of}} getting to it. Rick speculates this is the spacetime distortion that brought the dinosaurs back. The two split up to find an alternate route off the island, and Regina ends up being held at gunpoint by Dr. Kirk. He is about to kill her when the gun is shot out of his hand by Gail, and they arrest him again.|$|E
5|$|Psychedelic rock, {{with its}} {{distorted}} guitar sound, extended solos and adventurous compositions, {{has been seen}} as an important bridge between blues-oriented rock and later heavy metal. American bands whose loud, repetitive psychedelic rock emerged as early heavy metal included the Amboy Dukes and Steppenwolf. From England, two former guitarists with the Yardbirds, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page, moved on to form key acts in the genre, The Jeff Beck Group and Led Zeppelin respectively. Other major pioneers of the genre had begun as blues-based psychedelic bands, including Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Judas Priest and UFO. Psychedelic music also contributed to the origins of glam rock, with Marc Bolan changing his psychedelic folk duo into rock band <b>T.</b> <b>Rex</b> and becoming the first glam rock star from 1970. From 1971 David Bowie moved on from his early psychedelic work to develop his Ziggy Stardust persona, incorporating elements of professional make up, mime and performance into his act.|$|E
50|$|The single {{was in the}} UK charts for a {{total of}} three weeks, peaking at No. 41, making it <b>T.</b> <b>Rex's</b> lowest {{charting}} single during Bolan's lifetime.|$|R

5|$|Stepbrothers Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher {{attend a}} museum, where they {{discover}} a broken time machine {{built in the}} 1880s on display. Endeavoring to travel through time themselves, they begin fixing it to work properly. This catches the attention of their sister, Candace, who desires to inform their mother of their activities to get in trouble. When she finally gets their mother Linda to follow her and view the machine, Linda becomes distracted while Candace continues {{to walk to the}} boys, just as their time machine activates. The three are sent back to the Late Cretaceous Period (erroneously stated to be in 300 million B.C.), where a Tyrannosaurus rex immediately destroys the time machine. Now stranded, the three are forced to flee from the <b>T.</b> <b>rex</b> and are eventually saved by a herd of Alamosaurus lounging in a large pond.|$|E
5|$|By tabulating {{the number}} of {{specimens}} of each age group, Erickson and his colleagues were able to draw conclusions about life history in tyranosauridae populations. Their analysis showed that while juveniles were rare in the fossil record, subadults in the rapid growth phase and adults were far more common. Over half of the known <b>T.</b> <b>rex</b> specimens appear to have died within six years of reaching sexual maturity, a pattern that is also seen in other tyrannosaurs and in some large, long-lived birds and mammals today. These species are characterized by high infant mortality rates, followed by relatively low mortality among juveniles. Mortality increases again following sexual maturity, {{partly due to the}} stresses of reproduction. While this could be due to preservation or collection biases, Erickson hypothesized that the difference was due to low mortality among juveniles over a certain size, which is also seen in some modern large mammals, like elephants. This low mortality may have resulted from a lack of predation, since tyrannosaurs surpassed all contemporaneous predators in size by the age of two. Paleontologists have not found enough Daspletosaurus remains for a similar analysis, but Erickson notes that the same general trend seems to apply.|$|E
25|$|Hutchinson and Garcia {{used the}} {{reconstruction}} of <b>T.</b> <b>rex</b> musculature produced by Carrano and Hutchinson to ascertain its running abilities. They found that <b>T.</b> <b>rex</b> was not muscular enough for its body size to run quickly.|$|E
50|$|Since The Good Dinosaur {{is set in}} a {{world in}} which dinosaurs never became extinct, they were instead able to evolve. Herbivores like Arlo and his family become farmers, and {{carnivores}} like the <b>T.</b> <b>rexes</b> become ranchers. Because they are meant to be reminiscent of cowboys, when the <b>T.</b> <b>rexes</b> run, their lower bodies mimic a galloping horse, while their upper bodies have the feel of a riding cowboy. To help inspire Butch's physical look and performance, the filmmakers looked at classic film cowboys such as characters portrayed by Clint Eastwood and Jack Palance.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{promotion}} cycle for the album, EMI released three singles, including {{the cover of}} <b>T.</b> <b>Rex's</b> [...] "Get It On". Versions of these three singles are now included among the bonus tracks on the 2005 re-release.|$|R
50|$|McNabb cites his {{earliest}} musical influences as being from watching <b>T.</b> <b>Rex's</b> Born to Boogie and That'll Be the Day starring David Essex {{at the age}} of 10. After this he began attending Guitar and Music theory lessons.|$|R
25|$|Thomas Carr {{argued that}} Nanotyrannus was {{actually}} just a young Tyrannosaurus. He noticed that adult <b>T.</b> <b>rex</b> had fewer and more widely spaced {{teeth in the}} front tip of their jaws than juvenile <b>T.</b> <b>rex</b> or tyrannosaurs of other species, suggesting differences in feeding within and between tyrannosaur species.|$|E

5000|$|Marc is a British {{television}} series presented by <b>T.</b> <b>Rex's</b> lead singer Marc Bolan. It {{was produced in}} Manchester by Granada Television for the ITV network. [...] A second series was planned had Bolan not died {{before it could be}} produced.|$|R
5000|$|When Bolan {{died in a}} {{car crash}} in 1977, <b>T.</b> <b>Rex's</b> {{management}} paid tribute to Bolan by laying a large white swan made of flowers among the floral tributes on display at Golders Green Crematorium in North London, where his funeral was held.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} cover {{versions}} also appear: [...] "East West" [...] by Herman's Hermits, The Jam's [...] "That's Entertainment"; <b>T.</b> <b>Rex's</b> [...] "Cosmic Dancer"; Bradford's [...] "Skin Storm"; and {{a version of}} [...] "Sweet and Tender Hooligan" [...] by Morrissey's former band The Smiths.|$|R
25|$|Tanx is {{the eighth}} studio album by English glam rock act <b>T.</b> <b>Rex,</b> {{released}} on 28 January 1973 by record label EMI. Tanx was a musical departure from previous works: still containing {{tracks in the}} vein of The Slider, Marc Bolan showed his interest for both American soul music and funky music. Female backing singers appeared on a few tracks. New instruments such as mellotron were used, allowing the <b>T.</b> <b>Rex</b> sound to evolve.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{featured}} during the <b>T.</b> <b>Rex</b> jam session with Elton John in 1972 film Born to Boogie (1972).|$|E
25|$|In 1997 former bongo player Mickey Finn formed Mickey Finn's T-Rex {{which also}} {{included}} former <b>T.</b> <b>Rex</b> guitarist Jack Green and drummer Paul Fenton who recorded and toured {{with the band}} briefly. This band has also included former Smokie guitarist Alan Silson and Saxon guitarist Graham Oliver. Following Finn's death in 2003 the band continued on as <b>T.</b> <b>Rex</b> (A Celebration of Marc and Mickey) until a petition signed by Bill Legend, Tony Visconti and David Bowie, among others, forced them to revert their name back to Mickey Finn's T-Rex with his family's blessing.|$|E
50|$|In <b>T.</b> <b>Rex's</b> 1972 concert film Born to Boogie, Marc Bolan and Ringo Starr {{attempt to}} recite {{one of the}} lyrics from the song ("some people like to rock, some people like to roll, but movin' and a-groovin's gonna satisfy my soul"). However, they break into {{laughter}} each time.|$|R
5000|$|... "I Love to Boogie" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} on 5 June 1976 by record label EMI. It later appeared on <b>T.</b> <b>Rex's</b> final studio album, 1977's Dandy in the Underworld. The song was in the UK charts {{for a total of}} nine weeks, peaking at No. 13.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} reissued and remastered in 2001 along with Blondie's back catalog and {{featured}} four bonus tracks: a 1978 demo of [...] "Heart of Glass", live cover of <b>T.</b> <b>Rex's</b> song [...] "Bang a Gong (Get It On)" [...] and two live tracks taken from Picture This Live live album.|$|R
