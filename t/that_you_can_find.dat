25|$|Around April 19, 2000 Blizzard {{released}} new screenshots of Warcraft III, {{these were}} completely without interface. These screenshots showed heroes {{and a number}} of abilities. More screenshots came around May 2000. These screenshots showed the new interface of the game, which looked like the human interface in the eventual final release, however had small cannons above the minimap and the command button space. The gold display was still eye-shaped, but the last screenshot before E3 2000 shows a rectangle-shaped gold display. Most models, icons, textures and abilities <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> on these screenshots never appeared in the retail version. Then from E3 2000 around May 12, 2000 to ECTS 2000 the game didn't change very much. The next major changes came between ECTS 2000 and E3 2001, when a different interface and the Night Elf race was revealed.|$|E
