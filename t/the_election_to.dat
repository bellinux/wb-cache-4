5|$|Descended from a {{prominent}} political family, Beckham {{was chosen as}} Democrat William Goebel's running mate in the gubernatorial election of 1899 {{despite the fact that}} he turned 30, the minimum age for governor, during the campaign. Goebel lost <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>to</b> Republican William S. Taylor, but the Kentucky General Assembly disputed the election results. During the political wrangling that followed, an unknown assassin shot Goebel. A day later the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to give <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>to</b> Goebel, who was sworn into office on his deathbed. Taylor claimed the election had been stolen by the Democratic majority in the General Assembly and a legal fight ensued between him and Beckham over the governorship. Beckham ultimately prevailed and Taylor fled the state. Beckham later won a special election to fill the remainder of Goebel's term (since less than half the term had expired) and election in his own right in 1903.|$|E
5|$|On November 2, 1999, {{the city}} of Baltimore, Maryland, elected a new mayor, the 47th in the city's history. Primary {{elections}} were held to determine the nominees for the Democratic Party and Republican Party on September 14. Incumbent mayor Kurt Schmoke, a Democrat, opted not to run for reelection. Martin O'Malley, {{a member of the}} Baltimore City Council, won <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>to</b> succeed Schmoke.|$|E

5|$|A {{group that}} opposed the hippie {{movement}} {{managed to keep}} Guldy off the mayoral ballot in 1975. He became a write-in candidate for village trustee, with his friend, poet George Montgomery, running for mayor. Montgomery lost <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>to</b> Raivo Puusemp, a sculptor from SoHo. After his election, Puusemp chided Guldy for being a poor role model for the village youth. Puusemp was not a native of Rosendale and had not lived there long. By early July 1975, Puusemp had appointed a village dog warden after a dog bit a child and was allowed to run about the streets unrestrained.|$|E
5|$|After losing <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>to</b> Abraham Lincoln, Breckinridge {{worked for}} {{adoption}} of the Crittenden Compromise—authored by fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden—as a means of preserving the Union. Breckinridge believed the Crittenden proposal—restoring the Missouri Compromise line as the separator between slave and free territory in exchange for stricter enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and federal non-interference with slavery in the territories and Washington, D.C.—was the most extreme proposal to which the South would agree. Ultimately, the compromise was rejected and the Civil War soon followed.|$|E
5|$|After resigning {{as state}} party chairman, McNary {{prepared}} {{to campaign for}} a full term in the Senate. He faced Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives Robert N. Stanfield in the May 1918 Republican primary. McNary defeated Stanfield 52,546 to 30,999. In the November general election, he defeated a friend and former governor, Oswald West, 82,360 to 64,303, to win a full, six-year term in the Senate. Meanwhile, Frederick W. Mulkey won <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>to</b> replace McNary and finished Lane's original term, which would end in January 1919, and Mulkey took office on November 6, 1918, replacing McNary in that seat.|$|E

5|$|After {{visiting the}} village of Annisa to see his dying sister Macrina, he {{returned}} to Nyssa in August. In 380 he travelled to Sebaste, {{in the province of}} Armenia Prima, to support a pro-Nicene candidate for <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>to</b> the bishopric. To his surprise, he himself was elected to the seat, perhaps due to the population's association of him with his brother. However, Gregory deeply disliked the relatively unhellenized society of Armenia, and he was confronted by an investigation into his orthodoxy by local opponents of the Nicene theology. After a stay of several months, a substitute was found - possibly Gregory's brother Peter, who was bishop of Sebaste from 381 - and Gregory returned home to Nyssa to write books I and II of Against Eunomius.|$|E
5|$|An incensed Democratic {{majority}} in the Kentucky General Assembly created a committee to investigate the charges of voter fraud, even as armed citizens from heavily Republican eastern Kentucky poured into the state capital under auspices of keeping Democrats from stealing the election. Before the investigative committee could report, Goebel was shot by an unknown assassin while entering the state capitol on January 30, 1900. As Goebel lay in a nearby hotel being treated for his wounds, the committee issued its report recommending that the General Assembly invalidate enough votes to give <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>to</b> Goebel. The report was accepted, Taylor was deposed, and Goebel was sworn into office on January 31. He died three days later on February 2.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Nixon {{told his}} family he planned to run for {{president}} a second time. Although Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life (for example, she had been embarrassed by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech), she was supportive of her husband's ambitions. Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over the issue of the Vietnam War, a Republican had a good chance of winning, although he expected <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>to</b> be as close as in 1960.|$|E

40|$|<b>Elections</b> <b>to</b> Municipal Councils in the Czech Republic The {{topic of}} my Master'degree thesis are <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>to</b> {{municipal}} councils in the Czech Republic. I chose this topic mainly because these elections receive considerably less attention of professional {{literature and the}} media than other kinds of <b>elections,</b> particularly <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chamber of Deputies. It is so, although the decisions made by the municipal councils often have the biggest impact {{on the lives of}} ordinary people. Also this year, there were some interesting cases related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>to</b> municipal councils that the Constitutional Court had to decide and that only made my interest greater. The aim of this thesis is to give a complex description of the legislation concerning <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>to</b> municipal councils, to try to give some evaluation of this legislation and to suggest some possible changes to this legislation. This thesis consists of introduction, eight chapters and conclusion and its structure is essentially based on the structure of the Act No. 491 / 2001 Sb., on <b>Elections</b> <b>to</b> Representative Bodies of Municipalities and on Amendments to Certain Other Laws as amended. The introduction pursues the reasons why <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>to</b> municipal councils receive such relatively small attention and the problems which the [...] ...|$|R
5|$|Banks {{played a}} key role in 1856 in {{bringing}} forward John C. Frémont as a moderate Republican presidential nominee. Because of his success as speaker, Banks was considered a possible presidential contender, and his name was put in nomination by supporters (knowing that he supported Frémont) at the Know Nothing convention, held one week before the Republicans met. Banks then refused the Know Nothing nomination, which went instead to former President Millard Fillmore. Banks was active on the stump in support of Frémont, who lost <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>to</b> James Buchanan; Banks easily won reelection to his own seat. Democrats, however, regained control of the House of Representatives, depriving him of the speakership.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{sought and}} gained the 1910 Republican gubernatorial nomination. At that time, {{the party was}} deeply divided between {{progressive}} and conservative wings, and could not defeat the united Democrats; he lost <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>to</b> incumbent Judson Harmon. Harry Daugherty managed Harding's campaign, but the defeated candidate did not hold the loss against him. Despite the growing rift between them, both President Taft and former president Roosevelt came to Ohio to campaign for Harding, but their quarrels split the Republican Party and helped assure Harding's defeat.|$|E

Each of the two candidates had supporters in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth with the two opposing sides gathered around pro-Sigismund Chancellor and Great Crown Hetman Jan Zamoyski and the Primate of Poland, Stanisław Karnkowski {{on one side and the}} pro-Maximilain Zborowski family on the other. The rivalry between Zamoyski and the Zborowski family dated years past and tensions during the elections ran high.|$|E

Though some speculation arose as to whether Reagan might support New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in a presidential bid, nothing came of it. On March 25, she formally endorsed Senator John McCain, then the presumptive Republican party nominee for president, but McCain would go on to lose <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>to</b> Barack Obama.|$|E

5|$|In {{the event}} {{the office is}} vacant, <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>to</b> replace the {{president}} must occur between thirty and seventy days after the vacancy occurred. During normal election cycles, the elections must occur before {{the last two months}} of the current president. In either situation, the government body that calls for elections is the House of Representatives. The last round of presidential elections occurred in 2015. President Lukashenko, when addressing the press in February 2007, stated his health will determine if he will run in 2011 or step down at that time.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln ran for {{election}} as governor {{in his own}} right in 1809, but he was perceived by moderate Federalists as overly partisan and lacked the charisma of Sullivan. His support for Jefferson's economic policy, particularly that of embargoing trade with Great Britain and France (who were then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars) was costly. Federalists, who had regained control of the Massachusetts legislature in 1808, attacked his statements in support of Jefferson, and he lost <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>to</b> Christopher Gore, amid a complete Federalist takeover of the Massachusetts government (the outgoing Jefferson administration's repeal of the embargo before the election notwithstanding).|$|E
