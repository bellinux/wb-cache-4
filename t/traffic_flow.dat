30|$|Traffic network constraints. The {{traffic system}} and the {{electric}} power system have complex mutual influence. <b>Traffic</b> <b>flows</b> can affect the planning of charging stations {{and the construction of}} the power system. In turn, the distribution of charging stations also influences <b>traffic</b> <b>flows.</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>flows</b> are also greatly affected by user behavior and charging strategies. Therefore, the operation and planning of integrated electric and traffic systems is mainly constrained by <b>traffic</b> <b>flows,</b> <b>traffic</b> congestion levels, the road conditions and the potential to extend the road network, user behavior, weather conditions, and other factors [84, 85].|$|R

5|$|Caltrans {{proposed}} {{the installation of}} a metered traffic signal on I-8 west in Lakeside during 1987, {{in order to improve}} <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> in the mornings by inserting a short delay before entering San Diego should the rate exceed 2,000vehicles per hour. However, the state put its plans on hold shortly thereafter, following several concerns from the public, and from state senator Jim Ellis.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{controlled}} access highways on Hamersley's southern and western boundaries physically isolate the suburb from its neighbours and limit southbound exits to just two, Erindale Road and Wanneroo Road. This results in considerable rush hour congestion on {{the stretch of}} Erindale Road between Eglinton Crescent and Reid Highway. In 2004, Main Roads Western Australia provided a grant of $48,000 to the City of Stirling under its Black Spot Programme to improve the <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> in this area.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>flows</b> on {{the right}} or {{on the left side}} of the road {{depending}} on the country. [...] In countries where <b>traffic</b> <b>flows</b> {{on the right}}, traffic signs are mostly on the right side of the road, roundabouts and traffic circles go counter-clockwise/anti-clockwise, and pedestrians crossing a two-way road should watch out for traffic from the left first. In countries where <b>traffic</b> <b>flows</b> on the left, the reverse is true.|$|R
30|$|EDCA is a {{contention-based}} channel {{access and}} provides service differentiation in IEEE 802.11 e. Differentiated accesses to the wireless medium {{are provided by}} prioritizing the traffic categories (TC). There are at most eight prioritized output queues, {{one for each of}} the traffic categories. Changing the priorities of the <b>traffic</b> <b>flows</b> can consequently change the QoS received by the <b>traffic</b> <b>flows.</b> Different contention parameters can be tuned adaptively for each access category (AC) to treat the <b>traffic</b> <b>flows</b> differently. EDCA provides differentiated services among different traffic classes, but cannot provide the guaranteed throughputs and bounded delays. It provides a higher QoS to <b>traffic</b> <b>flows</b> with a higher priority while sacrificing the <b>traffic</b> <b>flows</b> with a lower priority, especially when the traffic load is heavy. The performance analysis of IEEE 802.11 e EDCA was presented in [18] and [19].|$|R

There is no guarantee how much service the system has to provide for these <b>traffic</b> <b>flows.</b> Without consideration of fair service, multiple data <b>traffic</b> <b>flows</b> in a same system may receive fairly different amounts of service, due to the different wireless channel conditions.

5|$|Like {{the similar}} COMPASS system on provincial freeways, RESCU {{combines}} in-pavement sensors with traffic cameras and changeable message signs (6 fixed and 10 portable) to alert drivers of accidents, traffic conditions and upcoming closures. The system {{is used as}} a means of managing <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> along the parkway. The message signs also frequently display non-urgent messages to motorists, such as notices for future construction, safety messages and smog alerts.|$|E

5|$|WSDOT is {{studying}} several different proposed {{changes to the}} SR224 / SR225 intersection to improve <b>traffic</b> <b>flow.</b> Several proposals have been introduced to alleviate the situation, including replacing the stop sign at the intersection with a traffic light, reconfiguring the intersection and the off ramp from I-82, and implementing several options featuring roundabouts.

5|$|An inquiry {{was held}} into {{widening}} the section from the Archway intersection to the Hornsey Lane Bridge to a three lane dual carriageway in 1969 and work started in 1971. It was {{originally intended to}} widen a further section of the road, but severe disruption led to the first inquiry being abandoned in 1978, and a second inquiry in 1984, chaired by Air Marshal Sir Michael Giddings, was also abandoned. The <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> was projected to increase to 180,000 cars a day by 1981, but by 1986 the actual flow was only 30,000 a day.|$|E
5|$|An {{interchange}} {{is planned}} between MD 12 and US 113 south of Snow Hill {{in order to}} improve safety and <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> as a follow up to widening US 113; however, the project is currently on hold. This proposed interchange is to be a dumbbell interchange, a variation of the diamond interchange with two roundabouts on MD 12 where it intersects the ramps to US 113. The proposed cost needed to build this interchange is $24.2 million, which includes engineering, acquisition of land, and the actual construction.|$|E
5|$|During 2016, the {{intersection}} with Gosnells Road West was upgraded with longer and extra turning lanes, better cycling and pedestrian facilities, and better street lighting and CCTV {{as part of}} the Black Spot program. This project was funded by the Western Australian State government, and cost $2.4 million. During 2016 and 2017, as part of Main Roads Western Australia's Traffic Congestion Management Program, {{the intersection}} with Kelvin Road was upgraded to improve <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> and safety.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an empirical}} {{model of the}} relationship between road traffic accidents and <b>traffic</b> <b>flows.</b> The analysis focuses on the accident externality which is mainly determined by the difference between the marginal and average risks. The model is estimated using a new dataset which combines hourly London traffic count data from automated vehicle recorders together with police records of road accidents. The accident-flow relationship is seen to vary considerably between different road classes and geographical areas. More importantly, even having controlled for these and other differences, the accident externality is shown to vary significantly with <b>traffic</b> <b>flows.</b> In particular, while the accident externality is typically close to zero for low to moderate <b>traffic</b> <b>flows,</b> it increases substantially at high <b>traffic</b> <b>flows.</b> Road <b>Traffic</b> Accidents; Traffic Flows; Accident Externalities...|$|R
5|$|In 2006, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{converted}} NY376's intersections {{with the}} main gate of Vassar College and College Avenue into roundabouts. Both of the roundabouts replaced traffic lights. A traffic signal used to control traffic for a pedestrian crosswalk was also removed {{as part of their}} construction. Another roundabout was constructed in 2008 at Fulton and Collegeview Avenues. NYSDOT has called the installation of roundabouts a success, stating that it has significantly calmed traffic, decreased congestion and increased <b>traffic</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the MTA filed {{to change}} the {{location}} of Entrance 1, moving it onto from the sidewalk, away from its original proposed location inside 301 East 69th Street. This was because designs for entrances inside the building failed to both satisfy the building's residents as well as meet the MTA's engineering requirements. With the New York City Department of Transportation planning a bike lane along {{the east side of}} Second Avenue after construction is finished, the MTA could widen the sidewalk {{to make room for the}} entrances without ultimately disrupting <b>traffic</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|E
5|$|In September 1990, the Morgantown {{interchange}} was {{relocated to}} provide a direct connection to I-176; the overhead interchange lights at the new exit were a nuisance to nearby residents.
