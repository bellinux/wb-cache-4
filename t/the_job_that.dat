5|$|Although the Japanese were {{experiencing}} similar problems {{in relation to}} supplies, they began their advance once again on 26 August and despite several rugged defensive actions the Australians were forced back again, first to Eora Creek on 30 August, then Templeton's Crossing on 2 September, and finally to Efogi three days later. Exhausted from their efforts and {{no longer able to}} be considered an effective fighting force, the 39th was relieved and sent down the track to Koitaki to rest. They had done <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>that</b> was required of them, having stalled the Japanese advance in order to allow reinforcements to be brought up. These reinforcements came {{in the shape of the}} 25th Brigade, comprising the 2/25th, 2/31st and 2/33rd Battalions. Bitter fighting ensued around Ioribaiwa and the Australians withdrew once again on 17 September, this time to Imita Ridge; however, the Japanese had reached their limit and on 24 September began to withdraw. The Australians subsequently launched a counter-offensive in October and by 2 November, Kokoda was back in Australian hands.|$|E
5|$|On 15 February 1959, it was {{organized}} {{to consist of}} the 1st Battle Group, 65th Infantry, {{an element of the}} 92nd Infantry Brigade. On February 21, 1960, commemorated as National Guard Day, the 65th Infantry Regiment was formally transferred from the Regular Army to the PRNG, in an activity where Gen. Cesár Cordero handed the units colors to Col. Rafael Rodríguez. That same year, Company B of the 65th Regiment created Employer's Day (Día del Patrono in Spanish) where the employer's of the volunteers that serve in the PRNG are instructed about <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>that</b> their employees do with the entity and participate in training of their own. The idea behind the initiative was facilitating the processing of the request of leave-of-absence to train for two weeks during the summer. On 1 May 1964, it was reorganized to consist of the 1st Battalion, 65th Infantry, and remained assigned to the 92nd. It was reorganized again on 1 April 1971, to consist of the 1st Battalion and the separate Company E. This was followed by another reorganization on 1 September 1978, to consist of the 1st and 2nd Battalions within the 92nd, as well as the separate Company E. Less than two years later another reorganization on 29 February 1980, eliminated the separate Company E while retaining the 1st and 2nd Battalions.|$|E

The chassis itself was built by one of the team's sponsors Hercules Aerospace in the US after former Hercules apprentice and then McLaren engineer Steve Nichols had advised Barnard, who along with Dennis had been unsuccessfully searching in England for a company willing to take on <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> <b>that</b> the US based company might be their best choice, and quickly revolutionised car design in Formula One with new levels of rigidity and driver protection.|$|E
25|$|Pulis {{was then}} {{out of work for}} two years, before the {{resignation}} of Stoke City's manager Steve Cotterill early into the 2002–03 season led to Pulis being given <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>that</b> November. Pulis immediately found himself in a relegation battle and it looked likely that the club would be relegated back to the Second Division only a year after being promoted. Pulis, however, completed the signings of striker Ade Akinbiyi and goalkeeper Mark Crossley, on loan from Crystal Palace and Middlesbrough respectively, who helped turn around the club's bad run. Stoke avoided relegation {{on the final day of}} the 2002–03 season with a 1–0 win over Reading at the Britannia Stadium, with Akinbiyi scoring the only goal of the match. Pulis rates Stoke's survival in 2002–03 as one of his best achievements in management.|$|E
25|$|Pierre and Eugénie Savoye {{approached}} Corbusier {{about building}} a country home in Poissy {{in the spring of}} 1928. The site was on a green field on an otherwise wooded plot of land with a magnificent landscape view to the north west that corresponded with the approach to the site along the road. Other than an initial brief prepared by Emile for a summer house, space for cars, an extra bedroom and a caretaker's lodge, Corbusier had such freedom with <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>that</b> he was only limited by his own architectural palette. He began work on the project in September 1928. His initial ideas were those that eventually manifested themselves in the final building but between Autumn 1928 and Spring 1929 he undertook a series of alternatives that were influenced primarily by the Savoye's concern about cost. The eventual solution to this problem was to reduce the volume of the building by moving the master bedroom down to the first floor and reducing the grid spacing down from 5 metres to 4.75 metres.|$|E
50|$|The Bracero Program allowed {{agribusiness}} {{access to}} a large pool of labor that had virtually no civil rights, and no recourse to address growing injustices.

As the war ended, few returning soldiers returned to <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> braceros were holding, and instead, they moved on to more industrial areas and reinforced the belief that immigrants take on <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>that</b> Americans would {{not be willing to}} do.|$|R

In March 2013, he spoke to his sister and told her that he wanted to return to Argentina. They believe that Tobares was kidnapped because he might have seen {{something}} suspicious while on <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>that</b> his employers did not want him to see. Tobares worked at Hotelito Desconocido and Nudoki Sushi Bar, but he was also a hired chef for private parties; his family told investigators that Tobares was sometimes taken by the CJNG, Tobares' last employer, to their private islands in western Mexico to cook for their exclusive events. He was not allowed to leave for a few days and was prohibited from using his cellphone while he was there. His family believes that in one of those private parties, Tobares saw something suspicious and began asking third-parties to clarify what he saw. When the CJNG found out what he was doing, Gerardo reportedly threatened him and told him to ask those question to his face. A week before his disappearance, Gerardo reportedly ordered Tobares to close down the Asian restaurant and fire all of the employees.|$|E

Horrocks, an infantry soldier with no experience in dealing with cavalry, was an unusual choice for commander of an armoured division. He trained the division hard, organising exercises to improve the effectiveness of his troops, and to familiarise himself with armoured warfare.

500|$|In July 1993, Weinberg had {{a chance}} {{sidewalk}} meeting outside Carnegie Deli with newly selected Late Night host Conan O'Brien, where Weinberg spoke about his ideas for music on the show. O'Brien promised Weinberg an audition. Within a few short days Weinberg put together The Max Weinberg 7, recruiting musicians he had worked with during his career including on the Killer Joe project, starting with guitarist and arranger Jimmy Vivino. Weinberg decided a muscular, drums-driven jump blues vibe, partly derived from the Killer Joe sound, is what he would use {{as a starting point}} for the group's sound. At the early August audition, the outfit impressed O'Brien with their ability to play not just rock but also rhythm and blues, soul, jazz, pop, and big band swing; Weinberg was so anxious to land <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>that</b> he threw up afterward. After a final meeting with executive producer Lorne Michaels they were hired as the house band. The band performed on the show every night since its premiere on September 13, 1993.

[...] Weinberg held the title of music director on the show, while Vivino did most of the arranging. Of his career rebound, Weinberg said simply: [...] "I grabbed the brass ring twice." ...|$|E
