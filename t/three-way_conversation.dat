5000|$|Their {{music has}} been praised by music critics for its {{originality}} and technical competence. One review of their 2014 performance at the Melbourne Music Festival captured {{the quality of their}} music well. [...] Musically, Tuba Skinny mines a rich seam of traditional jazz and blues from the '20s and '30s. And, while it's evident the band treasures the sense of history evoked by these vintage tunes, the players' natural exuberance makes the music feel irresistibly alive. Erika Lewis' vocals have a wonderfully earthy quality, her phrases often pulling behind the beat with a languid, world-weary drawl. On the instrumental numbers, Cohn's cornet outlined the melody and also engaged in spirited <b>three-way</b> <b>conversations</b> with Barnabus Jones' trombone and Jon Doyle's agile clarinet. Washboard player Robin Rapuzzi frolicked on the sidelines, his rhythmic explorations as captivating to watch as they were to listen to - even when the band was temporarily upstaged by a troupe of swing dancers, who launched into an athletic routine peppered with break-out solos and acrobatic air steps, offering a physical manifestation of the joy Tuba Skinny seem to bring with them wherever they go.|$|R

In this paper we examined <b>three-way</b> distributed <b>conversations</b> while varying the presence of spatial video and audio.

Specifically, users perceived that the conversations were of higher quality, they were more engaged, and they were better able {{to keep track of}} the conversation. In contrast, no significant benefits were found when mono audio was replaced by spatialized audio. The results of this work are important in that they provide strong evidence for continued exploration of spatialized video, and also suggest that the benefits of spatialized audio may have less of an impact when video is also spatialized.

40|$|Introduction: Because lack of {{inpatient}} {{capacity is}} associated with emergency department (ED) crowding, more efficient bed management could potentially alleviate this problem. Our goal {{was to assess the}} impact of involving a patient placement manager (PPM) early in the decision to hospitalize ED patients. The PPMs are clinically experienced registered nurses trained in the institution-specific criteria for correct unit and bed placement. Methods: We conducted two pilot studies that included all patients who were admitted to the adult hospital medicine service: 1) 10 / 24 to 11 / 22 / 2010 (30 days); and 2) 5 / 24 to 7 / 4 / 2011 (42 days). Each pilot study consisted of a baseline control period and a subsequent study period of equal duration. In each pilot we measured: 1) the number of “lateral transfers” or assignment errors in patient placement, 2) median length of stay (LOS) for “all” and “admitted” patients and 3) inpatient occupancy. In pilot 2, we added as a measure code 44 s, i. e. status change from inpatient to observation after patients are admitted, and also equipped all emergency physicians with portable phones in order to improve the efficiency of the process. Results: In pilot 1, the number of “lateral transfers” (incorrect patient placement assignments) during the control period was 79 of the 854 admissions (9. 3 %) versus 27 of 807 admissions (3. 3 %) during the study period (P< 0. 001). We found no statistically significant differences in inpatient occupancy or ED LOS for “all” or for “admitted” patients. In pilot 2, the number of “lateral transfers” was 120 of 1, 253 (9. 6 %) admissions in the control period and 42 of 1, 229 (3. 4 %) admissions in the study period (P< 0. 001). We found a 49 -minute (352 vs. 401 minutes) decrease in median LOS for “admitted” ED patients during the study period compared with the control period (P= 0. 04). The code 44 rates, median LOS for “all” patients and inpatient occupancy did not change. Conclusion: Inclusion of the PPM in a <b>three-way</b> handoff <b>conversation</b> between emergency physicians and hospitalist providers significantly decreased the number of “lateral transfers. ” Moreover, adding status determination and portable phones for emergency physicians improved the efficiency of the process and was associated with a 49 (12 %) minute decrease in LOS for admitted patients.

40|$|As {{a part of}} {{preparing}} for an exhibition, Mindy Lee, Amanda Couch, and Andrew Hladky have been meeting regularly to discuss their artistic practice and shared interest in guts. At the Body Horror 2 conference, we presented a snapshot of these discussions as a <b>three-way</b> <b>conversation.</b> Our artistic research centres on changing conceptualisations of the digestive system, the role these ideas have played in constructing and destabilising our sense of self/self-image, and the distaste and horror they can inspire. Recent medical research re-imagines the digestive system as a sensory organ and second brain, ‘a vibrant, modern data-processing center’ and the site of our most direct and complex physical interaction with the external world. The messages it sends {{to the rest of}} the body have a profound effect on our mood and ability to function, but its reasoning remains largely inaccessible to consciousness. The idea that our entrails lurk behind the scenes exerting a decisive influence on our actions is an unsettling one, challenging modern cerebro-centred images of selfhood and agency. Our artwork highlights these digestive ruminations, usually kept so carefully hidden. It emphasises its own materiality and brings to light its inner workings, showing those imagistic indigestions and textual regurgitations that can shatter the fragile surface illusion. Our <b>three-way</b> <b>conversation</b> exposes and disembowels the artwork and the ideas within it. In research we take in and incorporate the ideas and stories of the other, processing and digesting to regurgitate and repeat through our own perspectives as artists: Research as rumination...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an ongoing}} research-based collaboration between an academic literacies researcher and a {{lecturer in the}} field of Social Work aimed at exploring the nature of everyday writing in social work. The paper outlines the key principles of the methodology adopted—a text-oriented ethnography—and discusses the extent to which this methodology is facilitating a collaborative partnership towards meeting three interrelated goals: the empirical goal of building rich descriptions of writing in everyday social work practice; the ideological-epistemological goal of challenging a deficit discourse on writing (and writers); and the interventionist goal of working with institutions to harness writing in productive ways to learning and professional practice. Central to this methodological approach is an attempt to build a <b>three-way</b> <b>conversation</b> between the fields of 'new' literacy studies, in particular academic literacies; the discipline of social work education; and social work agencies/practitioners. We outline the methodology and foreground some key congruencies across these fields which are helping to facilitate successful collaboration...|$|E
40|$|On Innards is a {{multidisciplinary}} project developed by artists, Amanda Couch, Andrew Hladky, and Mindy Lee, that explores the changing conceptualisations of guts and digestion, {{their impact on}} the creative process and the role they play in constructing and destabilising our sense of self. Recently, bookwork artist and designer Richard Nash joined the project to collaborate on a record of this two-year project, dissecting, reinterpreting, and reconnecting it {{in the form of a}} limited edition artist book, On Innards | Publication, published by bookRoom press. Lee, Couch and Hladky begin by ruminating on their panel and <b>three-way</b> <b>conversation,</b> presented at the second international Interdisciplinary conference, Body Horror, in Athens, in 2013. Their reflections on the project, joined by Nash's are interwoven with recalled events, artefacts, images, and stories from the conference panel, and the On Innards | Exhibition and Event of 2014, which includes contributions by Carlo Comanducci, Giskin Day, Dr. Simon Gabe, Kerry Gallagher, Nathaniel Storey, and Jamie Sutcliffe and Jenny Pengilly. Curated and intervened by Nash, the book becomes an embodiment of digestion, its intestinal form, a multitude of folds; concertinas, fold-outs, pop-ups, gate-folds, roll-folds and reveals, held by a mesenteric binding, which, when unwound, allows the book to be opened further, unfolding to reveal hidden ideas, images and text...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} Foundation Degree {{qualifications}} in the UK (HEFCE, 2007) has {{lead to a}} more active view of employer engagement with Higher Education. Many full time Foundation Degree students are now taking up work placements with employers as part of their study. As a result, a <b>three-way</b> <b>conversation</b> between learners, employers and tutors needs to take place on an ongoing basis throughout placements. An online environment utilising blogs, e-portfolio and online work-based contracts can facilitate this ‘conversation’. Employers can be further supported through provision of online materials to support the process of mentor training. This paper reports on an HE Academy, ICS funded mini-project to create such an environment at Hull College for students on the Foundation Degree course in Software Design and Development. The project is still underway, and {{is in the middle of}} its year-long span. The environment has been chosen, developed and tested. The next phase will be to use the system for work-placement study. This paper outlines the use of Elgg as a means of maintaining communication with students, employers and tutors and encouraging reflection during Foundation Degree work placements. We aim to present the experience of using the online environment at the 8 th Annual Conference of the ICS HE Academy in August. More information on the project can be found at...|$|E
40|$|Karl Shell {{is without}} a doubt {{one of the central}} players in the {{development}} of economic theory and macroeconomics {{in the latter part of}} the twentieth century. He has made important contributions on topics ranging from growth theory, to overlapping generations, to extrinsic uncertainty, to monetary economics, to market games, and to technological innovation. His collaborations with Dave Cass are legend, and include the seminal formulation of the concept of sunspot equilibria. His Notes on the Economics of Infinity, and his papers with Yves Balasko are overlapping-generations classics. Shell s many coauthors read like a Who s Who in economics, and include (in no particular order) Joe Stiglitz, Franklin Fisher, Miguel Sidrauski, Ned Phelps, Duncan Foley, Walt Heller, Albert Ando, Jim Peck, Rod Garratt, Aditya Goenka, Christian Ghiglino, and Todd Keister. This is also a club to which we are also proud to belong. Shell s research is first rate and highly innovative, but his full contribution to economic theory must also be judged by his long service as the editor of one of the profession s premier journals, the Journal of Economic Theory. As the founding editor of JET, Shell took a small upstart journal, originally envisioned as a niche outlet for papers on mathematical economics, and turned it into one of the best in the profession. JET has published papers that have had major impacts on the development of economic theory in all its various flavors. Because of Shell s long stewardship of JET, the story of his professional life which we hope we have captured in this interview is also a history of the evolution of economic theory over the past quarter century. We spoke with Karl in his office at Cornell University and over lunch at the faculty club in the Statler, and the interview tapes we made were very much a <b>three-way</b> <b>conversation</b> between Karl and the two of us. In editing the transcripts of these tapes for publication, we wished to keep the focus of the conversation on Shell, and have therefore adopted the same anonymous MD moniker we used in our interview of Dave Cass to mask the identity of the questioner. We hope you enjoy the conversation as much as we did. ...|$|E
