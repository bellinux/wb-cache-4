50|$|Test holes 60 to 75 ft. deep to {{determine}} the character of foundation for the concrete piers disclosed compact sand, gravel and large boulders in layers of varying thicknesses, suitable for carrying pier loading without foundation piles.Pier construction started in May, 1920, when the head of track was 22 {{miles south of the}} bridge site. Supplies were freighted by sleds on the ice until the river broke and then by boats and wagons. Transportation difficulties were practically overcome when the track reached the river in September, 1920. At that time excavation for the south pier was complete and that for the north pier had been begun. A temporary trestle 100 ft. downstream from the bridge site permitted tracklaying to proceed and facilitated erection of the bridge without interference to traffic and to other construction work north of the river. Piles for the <b>trestle</b> <b>bents,</b> <b>piers</b> and abutments had been driven and the falsework for the steel span had been started from the north end before the track reached the site.|$|R
5000|$|The {{railroad}} {{track that}} runs {{across the bridge}} was originally part of the Boston & Maine Railroad, which connected to South Berwick, Maine, via an easement that is now Maine Route 236. In addition to replacing a vehicular span, the Sarah Long absorbed the traffic of a railroad trestle located just upriver which had collapsed on September 10, 1939. It had been weakened when a caisson used {{in the construction of}} the new bridge dragged its anchor cables, which pulled out several of the <b>trestle's</b> <b>bents,</b> sending B&M engine #3666 and a baggage car to the bottom of the river, where they remain. [...] Currently, the tracks lead only to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, and are used for the transportation of nuclear materials.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} bridge {{design for}} the San Francisco Bay span called for trestle approaches {{all the way to}} the swing span. On , the supports for a 120 ft section of eastern approach trestle, which had been built to within 120 ft of the swing span, washed out in the receding tide and the bridge plans were modified. The first proposed change was to modify the trestle approaches 200 ft immediately to the east and 600 ft immediately to the west of the swing span by changing these to double-track width. However, the wider <b>trestle</b> <b>bents</b> continued to vibrate in the receding tide. The final as-built design eliminated approximately 1080 ft of trestle approaches in favor of the six 180 ft steel truss spans, three on either side of the swing span.|$|R
40|$|Severe {{corrosion}} of epoxy coated rebar in the substructure of 5 major marine bridges in the Florida Keys {{was detected}} {{after only a}} few years of construction. Corrosion occurred underneath the coating and was preceded by loss of adherence between the steel and the coating. Damage surveys of the bridges, which were built around 1980, were conducted from 1986 to 2000. Corrosion resulted in delaminated areas (spalls) typically about 0. 3 m 2 each. After Initial detection, damage has been steadily accumulating at a rate of approximately 0. 1 spall per bridge <b>pier</b> (<b>bent)</b> per year. An initiation-propagation model for corrosion development reproduced the observed trends. The exploratory model assumes distribution of chloride diffusivity, rebar cover, chloride surface concentration, and propagation time. Interpretation of the results suggests that much of the early damage stemmed from rebar with high levels of coating distress, and that damage development depends mainly on the propagation stage of corrosion...|$|R
40|$|A compatibility-based strut-and-tie model C-STM is {{proposed}} for analyzing deep beams and disturbed regions with {{particular emphasis on}} reinforced concrete bridge piers. In addition to the normal strut-and-tie force equilibrium requirements the model accounts for non-linear behavior through displacement compatibility using inelastic constitutive laws of cracked reinforced concrete. The model is implemented into widely used commercial structural analysis software and validated against results from previously conducted large scale experiments. A near full-scale experiment on a reinforced concrete sub-assemblage that represents cantilevered and straddle <b>pier</b> <b>bents</b> is conducted to investigate the shear-flexure performance of deep (disturbed) regions. Insights into the development of nonlinear behavior and the final collapse failure mechanism are then evaluated and accurately modeled using the C-STM. It is concluded that the proposed C-STM serves as an advanced method of analysis that can predict with suitable accuracy the force-deformation response of both D- and B- regions, deep beams, and beam-columns. This provides engineers with a supplementary analysis tool {{that can be used}} to assess the nonlinear behavior of bridge piers with stocky members and/or large disturbed regions...|$|R
40|$|The $ 900 million Rt. 295 Direct Connect Project in New Jersey, USA is a {{major highway}} and bridge {{construction}} project currently under design. This project is {{to be built in}} several stages and in four separate contracts in one of the busiest corridors in the country where three major highways meet. It has numerous long span bridges that weave through the interchange at four separate levels. For the I- 295 Direct Connect Project, the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) required the use of precast post tensioned segmental piers where appropriate to expedite construction and to relieve motorists from construction related delays. In precast concrete construction, much of the pier fabrication can be done in an off-site pre-casting plant. This shortens the on-site labor and construction time, thereby reducing traffic delays and detours during construction. A pre-casting plant allows for both the efficiency of mass production and a high level of quality control. Consequently, the cost of the precast substructure will be reduced. With the high level of quality control attainable in a precast plant, high performance concrete can be used. This results in more durable substructure units with higher quality and better finish. The higher strength of high performance concrete allows the use of hollow sections. Hollow sections result in material savings, lower hauling and erection weights, and decreased foundation costs. In this paper, the design of post tensioned segmental straddle <b>bent</b> type <b>piers</b> is presented. An Excel Spreadsheet was developed for the design. The features of the spreadsheet discussed also describe the design procedure adopted. The efficient use of the spreadsheet shows that these piers can be routinely designed without complicated and expensive computer programs. The sequence of pier construction is also provided...|$|R
40|$|Concrete-filled steel tubes have {{wide range}} of {{applications}} in building and civil engineering structures due to their excellent earthquake resisting characteristics. In this study effectiveness of partially concrete-filled steel tubes (CFST) in rigid-frame bridge <b>pier</b> <b>bents</b> is examined {{in terms of their}} ultimate strength and ductility performances. The columns and beam of frames consist of an un-stiffened rectangular-shaped steel section. Pushover analyses of single columns and rigid-frames were carried out using beam-column elements associated with nonlinear stress-strain relations for both concrete and steel. The effect of filled-in height of single columns was first examined by comparing the ultimate displacement and the ultimate strength determined using an available failure criterion established for cantilever type concrete-filled steel columns. The optimum concrete-filled height of the single columns was found to be around 0. 30 times the column height. The pushover analyses were carried out for three rigid-frames having different filled-in heights. The ultimate displacement and the ultimate strength of concrete-filled rigid-frame were significantly higher than those of the hollow section frame. The optimum filled-in height of rigid-frames was found to be around 0. 15 times the total height of the frame...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} ASR/DEF on the D-regions of {{structures}} are investigated {{by means of}} a dual experimental and analytical modeling program. Four near full scale specimens that represent cantilever and straddle <b>pier</b> <b>bents,</b> that are representative of typical bridges in Texas, are constructed, conditioned over time, and tested to failure. The undamaged first specimen serves as the control specimen, while the next two are tested after eight months and two years of field conditioning through the Texas heat along with supplemental water aimed at promoting ASR/DEF. The fourth remains to be tested within the next three years. In the two specimens subjected to deterioration, early formation of ASR gel is observed, and with time load-induced cracks along with other additional cracks are observed. These additional cracks are a result of the continued formation of ASR gel, which causes the concrete to swell, and in turn puts the reinforcing steel into a state of active prestress. It is observed that the failure mechanism in all the specimens is a brittle shear failure through the beam-column joint. Specimens with ASR/DEF deterioration show greater stiffness and strength, and slightly greater ductility...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€” A seismic {{vulnerability}} {{evaluation method}} based on structural analysis for RC bridges with simple <b>pier</b> <b>bents</b> is {{proposed in the}} paper. The proposed method {{is based on the}} hypothesis of the flexible pier-rigid deck behavior of the structure subjected to transversal seismic loads. A flexible pier-rigid deck simplified model was therefore developed. This model has been chosen after verifying the correlation between the responses of the proposed model and of the real structure which was presented by Egyptian General Authority of Roads and Bridges. The damage produced by the earthquake load is centered on the piers of the bridge, while the dynamic study of the deck can be performed after the structural analysis of the piers in an uncoupled way. The maximum damage of the piers under seismic actions is the principal aim of the proposed structural evaluation methodology. A damage index is used for this purpose, which describes the state of the material at each point of the structure. The study success to present the fragility curves which show that the peak ground acceleration for 50 % probability of exceeding slight, moderate and sever damage ranges from approximately 0. 15 to 0. 4 g for this typical and repeated RC bridge in Egypt...|$|R
40|$|Local scour around bridge {{foundations}} {{has been}} {{recognized as one of}} the main causes of bridge failures. The objective of this study is to investigate the relationships among field, laboratory, and numerical data for the purpose of improving scour prediction methods for complex bridge piers. In this study, three field sites in Georgia were selected for continuous monitoring and associated laboratory models were fabricated with physical scale ratios that modeled the full river and bridge cross sections to consider the effect of river bathymetry and bridge geometry. Three different sizes of sediment and several geometric scales of the bridge pier models were used in this study to investigate the scaling effect of relative sediment size, which is defined as the ratio of the pier width to the median sediment size. The velocity field for each bridge model was measured by the acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) to explain the complicated hydrodynamics of the flow field around bridge piers as guided by the results from a numerical model. In each physical model with river bathymetry, the comparison between the results of laboratory experiments and the measurements of prototype bridge pier scour showed good agreement for the maximum pier scour depth at the nose of the pier as well as for the velocity distribution upstream of each bridge <b>pier</b> <b>bent.</b> Accepted scour prediction formulae were evaluated by comparison with extensive laboratory and field data. The effect of relative sediment size on the local pier scour depth was examined and a modified relationship between the local pier scour depth and the relative sediment size was presented. A useful methodology for designing physical models was developed to reproduce and predict local scour depth around complex piers considering Froude number similarity, flow intensity, and relative sediment size.

40|$|Simplified {{methods of}} seismic verification, using {{equivalent}} single {{degree of freedom}} systems for the response prediction, {{have been the subject}} of great emphasis on research in the field of earthquake engineering particularly since the mid- 1990 s. This interest is justified still today by the great uncertainty characterizing the prediction of the seismic response: the variability of the parameters influencing the structural capacity and the seismic input definition, makes the use of sophisticated models not always effective and warranted. Furthermore, the extensive use of Non Linear Time-History (NLTH) analyses requires a calibration of the hysteretic model parameters and ground motions that seems still to date hardly applicable to day to day engineering practice. At the same time in last decade the design for earthquake resistance has undergone a critical review, triggered by the concept of Performance-Based Design. Performance objectives represent the attainment of certain damage levels for a given seismic intensity, and it has been widely recognized that the damage measure for a structure is directly related to deformations: displacements are the fundamental index of structural damage in seismic events and the achievement of the target displacement in relation to the different limit states should be the main objective of the verification procedure. Displacement-Based methods for seismic verification of structures hold together the two aspects evidenced so far, being simplified procedures which rely on a substitute SDOF structure and use as reference control parameter the target limit displacement for the system under exam. At present Displacement-Based Design (DBD) methods for new structures have reached a degree of formalization almost complete, with the recent publication of a Model Code for their adoption into seismic codes (Calvi and Sullivan, 2009). However, several aspects related to the method calibration are still matter of research, being the representativeness of the substitute linear structure a critical issue, in particular the formulation of equivalent viscous damping and the definition of the target displacement profile for a given structural system. With regard to the appraisal of existing structures, the development of Displacement-Based Assessment (DBA) approach represents the state of the art of research in this field, since so far the calibration of the methods dealt essentially with new structures only. The specific problems of the development of DBA methodologies include the prediction of the possible collapse mechanisms due to brittle rupture of members (which may be substantially different from those of the new ductile structures, designed following capacity design criteria), and the inclusion of local damage effects caused by nodes not adequately confined. In this context the research activity focuses on the evaluation, calibration and development of simplified Displacement-Based approaches for seismic verification of bridge structures, with particular reference to their use in a probabilistic framework, represented by vulnerability analyses and risk calculation on a large scale. In the first part the thesis addresses the methodological aspects of the DBD procedures focusing on the error sources of the simplified methods. In particular the current design methods for new structures with flexural ductile behaviour are evaluated, with reference to the formulations of the equivalent viscous damping and target displacement profile to be adopted in the analysis. A first study investigates the accuracy of the current Direct Displacement-Based Design (DDBD) procedure applied to simple SDOF systems (with specific reference to multi-span simply supported rc bridge piers), the main error sources being the approximation of the substitute linear structure characterized by the equivalent viscous damping, and the scaling of the displacement elastic spectrum through the modification damping factor. Using different formulations proposed in literature for equivalent viscous damping and spectrum reduction factor, a parametric study is carried out on an ample set of SDOF systems (previously designed with the DDBD method and subsequently verified with NLTH analyses), and an average error chart is obtained, allowing the prediction of the expected error for the design cases of multi-span simply supported bridge piers. A second work investigates the representativeness of the equivalent SDOF structure related to the estimation of the design displacement profile within a displacement-based framework. In the case of transverse response prediction for continuous rc girder bridges, the accuracy of the current iterative Direct Displacement-Based method (called DBD-IT in this work) is evaluated, and compared to an alternative direct design method (named DBD-DEM) herein proposed. The alternative methods combine in a non-iterative procedure the DBD framework with a Response Spectrum Analysis carried out with effective stiffness. In the second part the methodological aspects are addressed with regard to the specific issues of the existing bridge structures, not seismically designed (and not satisfying capacity design principles), and thus characterized by failure modes, limit states, hysteretic behaviour, and local ductility of the nodes that are different from those characterizing new seismically designed structures. In particular the calibration effort regards the assessment of pier capacity, piers generally representing the most vulnerable elements in existing bridges. A simplified numerical model is defined for the aggregation of phenomenological non linear shear behaviour and fiber representation of flexural behaviour for piers, calibrated by using experimental results on rc columns with flexure and shear failure extracted from on line databases (PEER database). A parametrical study is then developed for single bent and multiple <b>bent</b> <b>piers</b> (cantilever, walls frame), considering all main geometrical and material properties that can influence the pier capacity, aiming at the determination of the effective properties for existing rc bridge piers, to be used in a Displacement-Based framework. The effective ranges of the selected parameters were determined by a preliminary statistical analysis on the bridges of the reference database (the Veneto Region road network bridge stock, named VR stock). With regard to the appraisal of existing structures, the specific advantage in the use of simplified analytical procedures becomes apparent when a probabilistic seismic risk estimation is carried out on a large-scale. In this study, in the final part, the DBA method previously calibrated, is applied to assess the seismic vulnerability of the bridge stock under exam on a regional scale. A limited number of bridges are chosen as reference examples for each homogeneous subclass of multi-span bridges, comparing simplified DBA procedures with NLTH analyses for the development of analytical fragility curves, and an extensive vulnerability analysis for the class of multi-span rc bridges of the VR stock is then developed, using the previously calibrated DB fragility curves. Finally regional seismic risk maps are drafted including all the multi-span rc bridges of the VR stock, for three different scenarios of damage: the seismic risk is obtained by the convolution of hazard functions, defined on the base of the PGA exceedance probabilities provided by the current Italian seismic code, and the analytical fragility curves calculated with the Displacement-Based approaches. An immediate extension of the research on existing rc bridges, may be represented by the development of fragility curves for the whole classes of multi-span structures: these fragility functions could be obtained considering the variability in the range of geometrical and mechanical characteristics obtained from the statistical analysis of the VR database for that specific classes, and the envelope curves obtained could than be applied for the vulnerability evaluation of typical bridges of the Italian or European stocks. A long-term development of the work may regard the extension of the simplified Displacement-Based procedures to the evaluation of different classes of structures, particularly of single span rc bridges and masonry arch bridges, which represent the other major category of existing bridges, to complete as much as possible the scenario of seismic risk for the infrastructure network under examination. In this context it will be possible to calibrate the seismic input for risk analysis through the use of hazard curves, obtained from micro-zonation studies in the areas of interest. ...|$|R
