5|$|The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm is a 550MW {{power plant}} in Riverside County, California, that uses {{thin-film}} CdTe-modules made by First Solar. As of November 2014, the 550 megawatt <b>Topaz</b> Solar Farm was the largest photovoltaic {{power plant in}} the world. This was surpassed by the 579 MW Solar Star complex. The current largest photovoltaic power station {{in the world is}} Longyangxia Dam Solar Park, in Gonghe County, Qinghai, China.|$|E
5|$|The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm is a 550megawatt (MWAC) {{photovoltaic}} {{power station}} approximately six miles north of Desert Center, California, in the Mojave Desert. It uses approximately 8.8 million cadmium telluride modules made by the US thin-film manufacturer First Solar. As of Fall 2015, the Solar Farm has the same 550MW installed capacity as the <b>Topaz</b> Solar Farm in the Carrizo Plain region of Central California, making both of them tied for the second largest completed solar plants by installed capacity.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, two U.S. highways, both {{formed in}} 1926, were {{extended}} into California using El Camino Sierra. The southern terminus of U.S.395 was extended from Spokane, Washington to San Diego, using El Camino Sierra from near {{what is now}} <b>Topaz</b> Lake to Inyokern, by 1935. By 1937, U.S. Route 6 was extended from Colorado, mostly along the Midland Trail, to Long Beach using El Camino Sierra south of Bishop. As part of the 1964 state highway renumbering US6 was truncated at Bishop, and the route from the separation with US395 to I-5 was renumbered SR14.|$|E
5|$|Several of Necrid's attacks {{duplicate}} physical {{motions and}} properties of attacks used by other {{characters in the}} series. However, each attack causes his weapon to extend from then retract into his hands, resulting in different visual cues than the move they derive from. Some attacks combine elements of two other existing character moves; for example, Dragon Blaze begins with one attack used by Maxi and ends with another from Nightmare. Despite this fact some moves are unique to Necrid's repertoire, such as Elder <b>Topaz,</b> an attack stance that allows {{the use of an}} altered set of attacks for a short time, and Void Cannon, which creates a small explosion on the ground at varying distances from Necrid.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} many large plants under {{construction}}. The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm {{under construction in}} Riverside County, California and <b>Topaz</b> Solar Farm being built in San Luis Obispo County, California are both 550 MW solar parks that will use thin-film solar photovoltaic modules made by First Solar. The Blythe Solar Power Project is a 500 MW photovoltaic station under construction in Riverside County, California. The California Valley Solar Ranch (CVSR) is a 250megawatt (MW) solar photovoltaic power plant, which is being built by SunPower in the Carrizo Plain, northeast of California Valley. The 230 MW Antelope Valley Solar Ranch is a First Solar photovoltaic project which is under construction in the Antelope Valley area of the Western Mojave Desert, and due {{to be completed in}} 2013. The Mesquite Solar project is a photovoltaic solar power plant being built in Arlington, Maricopa County, Arizona, owned by Sempra Generation. Phase1 will have a nameplate capacity of 150megawatts.|$|E
5|$|U.S.395 was rebuilt {{on a new}} {{alignment}} on {{the ascent}} to Sherwin Summit and around Crowley Lake. Unlike the highway relocation in southern California, the old alignments have been renamed, now called Lower Rock Creek Road, Old Sherwin Grade, and Crowley Creek Road; not Sierra Highway. From here to Lake Tahoe, the highway crosses mountainous terrain inside the Sierra Nevada, giving the highway its name. While in the Sierra Nevada, the road passes by attractions such as Mammoth Mountain, Yosemite National Park and Mono Lake. El Camino Sierra separates from U.S.395, {{just prior to the}} Nevada state line at <b>Topaz</b> Lake, following SR89. This is the only portion of the route not used year-round, as Caltrans closes Route89 over Monitor Pass during winter months. Motorists destined for Lake Tahoe during the winter closures can continue along US395 into Nevada, and return to California via Nevada State Route 88 or Nevada State Route 207.|$|E
5|$|Oil {{has been}} pumped {{from the bay}} since 1912, but fishing has been a {{mainstay}} since humans have inhabited the area. In the early 1970s, recreational fishing accounted for a yearly input of $17million to the local economy, while commercial fishermen contributed $27.3 million. Commercial oyster farming was common in the bay until 1995, when the Texas Department of State Health Services suspended the practice, due to an unhealthy annual average zinc level of nearly 2500mg/kg in oysters, which as filter feeders, are affected by high levels of zinc in the water. The excessive zinc {{is believed to have}} been dumped into the bay by the American Smelting and Refining Company's Encycle Texas Incorporated subsidiary, which operated a zinc refinery at the site from 1942 to 1985. The Nueces Bay Power Station is also believed to have discharged zinc used for coolant until December 2002. Since that time, zinc levels in the bay have been reduced to slightly under 1000mg/kg, which remains above the healthy levels of 700mg/kg. The power station has since come under the control of the <b>Topaz</b> Power Group. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has established the Total Maximum Daily Load Program to measure the level of pollutants throughout the Nueces watershed, in an effort to restore the bay to safe levels of contaminants. Pesticides that seep into the bay from the heavy agricultural activity on the north shore can also spur adverse environmental effects.|$|E
5|$|Rich traders contributed {{significantly}} to the king's treasury through paying import and export taxes. The edicts of the Aihole Svamis mention trade ties with foreign kingdoms such as Chera, Pandya, Maleya (Malaysia), Magadh, Kaushal, Saurashtra, Kurumba, Kambhoja (Cambodia), Lata (Gujarat), Parasa (Persia) and Nepal. Travelling both land and sea routes, these merchants traded mostly in precious stones, spices and perfumes, and other specialty items such as camphor. Business flourished in precious stones such as diamonds, lapis lazuli, onyx, <b>topaz,</b> carbuncles and emeralds. Commonly traded spices were cardamom, saffron, and cloves, while perfumes included the by-products of sandalwood, bdellium, musk, civet and rose. These items were sold either in bulk or hawked on streets by local merchants in towns. The Western Chalukyas controlled most of South India's west coast and by the 10th century they had established extensive trade ties with the Tang Empire of China, the empires of Southeast Asia and the Abbasid Caliphate in Bhagdad, and by the 12th century Chinese fleets were frequenting Indian ports. Exports to Song Dynasty China included textiles, spices, medicinal plants, jewels, ivory, rhino horn, ebony and camphor. The same products also reached ports in the west such as Dhofar and Aden. The final destinations for those trading with the west were Persia, Arabia and Egypt. The thriving trade center of Siraf, a port on the eastern coast of the Persian Gulf, served an international clientele of merchants including those from the Chalukya empire who were feasted by wealthy local merchants during business visits. An indicator of the Indian merchants' importance in Siraf comes from records describing dining plates reserved for them. In addition to this, Siraf received aloe wood, perfumes, sandalwood and condiments. The most expensive import to South India were Arabian horse shipments, this trade being monopolised by Arabs and local Brahmin merchants. Traveller Marco Polo, in the 13th century, recorded that the breeding of horses never succeeded in India due to differing climatic, soil and grassland conditions.|$|E

The Seychellois then engaged and after shooting off 10,000 rounds of machine gun fire, the dhow was burning and eventually sank. Twenty-seven members of the dhow's crew were rescued and the <b>Topaz</b> was returning to base when she was attacked by a trawler and two skiffs.

25|$|Pit'dah (פִּטְדָה = in the masoretic text) / Topazios (in the Septuagint) - {{despite the}} {{suggestion}} of the Septuagint that it was <b>Topaz,</b> <b>Topaz</b> was scarcely known {{at the time the}} Book of Exodus was written (according to both the traditional dating of the book and that by critical scholars); in the classical era, topazios referred to Topazos Island on which a particular yellow mineral was mined (topazios means to seek, in reference to the difficulty in finding the island). Others suggest that <b>topaz</b> was merely peridot, a light green semi-precious stone, and which stone in the ancient world was found primarily on Topazos Island as well as on St. John’s Island (Zabargad) in the Egyptian Red Sea. The word pit'dah is thought by scholars to be connected with the Assyrian word hipindu, which refers to something that flashed (presumably meaning shimmered), and thus the jewel in question would fit the description of Chrysolite, a translucent greenish yellow mineral, common throughout the Levant, and particularly found on a particular island in the Red Sea, {{under the control of the}} Egyptian Pharaoh.|$|E
