5|$|A {{convenient}} {{means of}} determining {{the order of a}} given sigmatropic rearrangement is to number the atoms of the bond being broken as atom 1, and then count the atoms in each direction from the broken bond to the atoms <b>that</b> <b>form</b> <b>the</b> new σ-bond in the product, numbering consecutively. The numbers that correspond to the atoms forming the new bond are then separated by a comma and placed within brackets to create the sigmatropic reaction order descriptor.|$|E

The integrated circuit has eight levels: (1) a 300 nm thick Nb ground plane, (2) a 2 μm layer of SiO2 <b>that</b> <b>forms</b> <b>the</b> microstripline dielectric, (3) a 200 nm Nb film <b>that</b> <b>forms</b> <b>the</b> lower electrode of the Josephson junctions, (4) a 3 nm metal oxide layer <b>that</b> <b>forms</b> <b>the</b> Josephson tunneling barrier, (5) a 100 nm Nb junction counter electrode (6) a 300 nm SiO2 film with windows for contacts {{to the counter}} electrode, (7) a 400 nm film of Nb that connects the junction counter electrodes, and (8) a 100 nm resistive film <b>that</b> <b>forms</b> <b>the</b> stripline terminations.|$|R

5|$|Jupiter's {{atmosphere}} {{has multiple}} jet streams, {{caused by the}} convection cells <b>that</b> <b>form</b> <b>the</b> familiar banded color structure; on Jupiter, these convection cells are driven by internal heating. The factors that control the number of jet streams in a planetary atmosphere is an active area of research in dynamical meteorology. In models, as one increases the planetary radius, holding all other parameters fixed, the number of jet streams decreases.|$|E

5|$|Other {{volcanic}} events elsewhere {{interacted with}} groundwater and magma creating numerous pit craters. Many of these pit craters {{have been filled}} with water creating several crater lakes. In some places glacial till and fluvial sands and gravels are maintained under the several lava flows <b>that</b> <b>form</b> <b>the</b> volcanic field. Paleosols are found, but are rare. Glaciation has left a thick blanket of till over {{nearly all of the}} volcanic deposits and therefore outcrop is largely limited to cliffforming exposures in several valleys.|$|E
5|$|Plaque is a biofilm {{consisting}} of {{large quantities of}} various bacteria that form on teeth. If not removed regularly, plaque buildup can lead to periodontal problems such as gingivitis. Given time, plaque can mineralize along the gingiva, forming tartar. The microorganisms <b>that</b> <b>form</b> <b>the</b> biofilm are almost entirely bacteria (mainly streptococcus and anaerobes), with the composition varying by location in the mouth. Streptococcus mutans {{is the most important}} bacterium associated with dental caries.|$|E
5|$|Portrait of a Lady (or Portrait of a Woman) {{is a small}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} executed around 1460 by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden.

The vivid contrasts of darkness and light enhance the almost unnatural beauty and Gothic elegance of the model.|$|E

5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are part}} of the body's {{integumentary}} system and serve to protect the body against germs. Sebaceous glands secrete acids <b>that</b> <b>form</b> <b>the</b> acid mantle. This is a very fine, slightly acidic film {{on the surface of the}} skin that acts as a barrier to bacteria, viruses, and other potential contaminants that might penetrate the skin. The pH of the skin is between 4.5 and 6.2, and this acidity helps to neutralise the primarily alkaline nature of contaminants.|$|E
5|$|Some sponges also secrete exoskeletons {{that lie}} {{completely}} outside their organic components. For example, sclerosponges ("hard sponges") have massive calcium carbonate exoskeletons {{over which the}} organic matter forms a thin layer with choanocyte chambers in pits in the mineral. These exoskeletons are secreted by the pinacocytes <b>that</b> <b>form</b> <b>the</b> animals' skins.|$|E

5|$|The Marcellus {{is easily}} eroded, {{and is also}} found {{underlying}} low areas between some Appalachian ridges, forming linear valleys of moderate relief. These bedrock surfaces are typically covered with colluvium from erosion of stratigraphically higher and more erosion-resistant strata <b>that</b> <b>form</b> <b>the</b> surrounding higher ground. The soils formed from the Marcellus and the overlying Hamilton shales are deep, free of stones, and well suited for agriculture.|$|E

In archaea there are two different PH-like proteins (called Rrp41 and Rrp42), each present three times in an alternating order. Eukaryotic exosome complexes have six different proteins <b>that</b> <b>form</b> <b>the</b> ring structure. Of these six eukaryotic proteins, three resemble the archaeal Rrp41 protein and the other three proteins are more similar to the archaeal Rrp42 protein.|$|E
