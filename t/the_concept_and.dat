5|$|A {{one-shot}} crossover between Revival and Chew {{was announced}} on February 12, 2014, and released on May 28, 2014. The idea was proposed by Chew writer John Layman, but was initially opposed {{by all the}} other creators. Layman continued to push <b>the</b> <b>concept,</b> <b>and</b> eventually wrote the story anyway. He emailed it to Seeley, Norton, and Chew artist Rob Guillory, and after reading it they all agreed to participate. It was constructed as a double-sided book with two stories, one by each creative team.|$|E

After some acrimony between the two parties, a deal was struck between them in 1966, whereby they would both continue to manufacture instruments independently. Bradmatic renamed themselves Streetly Electronics in 1970.|$|E

5|$|Interest in {{the risk}} parity {{approach}} has increased since the late 2000s financial crisis as the risk parity approach fared better than traditionally constructed portfolios, {{as well as many}} hedge funds.

Carter worked with NYPD Blue producer Daniel Sackheim in further developing the pilot, drawing stylistic inspiration from the 1988 documentary The Thin Blue Line, and the English television series Prime Suspect. Inspiration was also taken from Carter's memories of watching Kolchak: The Night Stalker and The Twilight Zone in his youth; {{as well as from}} the then-recently released film The Silence of the Lambs, which was the impetus for framing the series around agents from the FBI, in order to provide the characters with a more plausible reason for being involved in each case than Carter believed was present in Kolchak. Carter was also keen on keeping the relationship between the two lead roles strictly platonic, basing their interactions on the characters of Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) and John Steed (Patrick Macnee) in the series The Avengers.|$|E

5|$|Fighters Uncaged was {{announced}} by Ubisoft at Gamescom 2010, {{three months before}} its official release. There, people were allowed to preview the game. The game was developed by AMA Studios and published by Ubisoft exclusively for the Xbox 360 Kinect. Because the announcement came suddenly {{and close to the}} release date, video game journalists such as Christopher Grant of Engadget and Jamin Smith of VideoGamer were not intrigued. Grant was unimpressed by the game's announcement, criticizing <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>and</b> its character designs and noted a misspelling in the preview. The game was originally planned to feature a multiplayer mode, though this was cut later on in development.|$|E
5|$|From {{a handful}} of company designs, Saville {{selected}} Hughes Aircraft to make the FCS. Saville worked closely with Dr. Ruben F. Mettler of Hughes, {{to lay out the}} desired strategy of the weapons system and to describe the expected fighter tactics. This weapon would eventually be developed as the AIM-4 Falcon after much urging by Saville. The Falcon was used successfully for more than a decade, beginning in 1956. Designing an aircraft around a weapons system was something Saville had witnessed in the development of Bell's P-39 Airacobra around a large autocannon, but he further refined <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>and</b> made it a requirement for government contractors, a practice that is continued to this day. Saville put an end to specific design goals in aircraft requests for proposal (RFPs); instead, he briefed potential designers on general requirements and discussed with them the defense problems the aircraft was to solve.|$|E

5|$|In another story, {{based on}} an old folktale-motif, and echoing a similar theme, Demeter was searching for her daughter, Persephone, having taken {{the form of an}} old woman called Doso, and {{received}} a hospitable welcome from Celeus, the King of Eleusis in Attica. As a gift to Celeus, because of his hospitality, Demeter planned to make his son Demophon a god, but she was unable to complete the ritual because his mother Metanira walked in and saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright, which angered Demeter, who lamented that foolish mortals do not understand <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>and</b> ritual.|$|E
5|$|Jan Pinkava came up {{with the}} concept in 2000, {{creating}} the original design, sets and characters and core storyline, but he was never formally named the director of the film. Lacking confidence in Pinkava's story development, Pixar management replaced him with Bird in 2005. Bird was attracted to the film because of the outlandishness of <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>and</b> the conflict that drove it: that rats feared kitchens, yet a rat wanted to work in one. Bird was also delighted that the film could be made a highly physical comedy, with the character of Linguini providing endless fun for the animators. Bird rewrote the story, with a change in emphasis. He killed off Gusteau, gave larger roles to Skinner and Colette, and also changed the appearance of the rats to be less anthropomorphic.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin {{conceived}} the political drama The West Wing in 1997 {{when he went}} unprepared to a lunch with producer John Wells and in a panic pitched to Wells a series centered on the senior staff of the White House, using leftover ideas from his script for The American President. He told Wells about his visits to the White House while doing research for The American President, and they found themselves discussing public service and {{the passion of the}} people who serve. Wells took <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>and</b> pitched it to the NBC network, but was told to wait because the facts behind the Lewinsky scandal were breaking and there was concern that an audience {{would not be able to}} take a series about the White House seriously. When a year later some other networks started showing interest in The West Wing, NBC decided to greenlight the series despite their previous reluctance. The pilot debuted in the fall of 1999 and was produced by Warner Bros. Television.|$|E

5|$|The XJ220 was not {{initially}} {{intended to be}} a production car, but, following the reception of <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>and</b> financial interest from serious buyers, a feasibility study was carried out by teams from TWR and Jaguar. Its conclusion was that such a car would be technically feasible (subject to engineering changes), {{and that it would be}} financially viable. The announcement of a limited production run of 220 to 350 cars came on 20 December 1989. The list price on 1 January 1990 was £290,000 exclusive of value added tax, options and delivery charges, but by 1992 that had increased considerably owing to indexation of contracts. The offer was four times oversubscribed, and deposits of £50,000 exclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT) were taken from around 1400 customers; first deliveries were planned for mid-1992.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the single's US picture sleeve {{consisted}} of a photo of Harrison playing guitar inside the central tower of his recently purchased home, Friar Park, in Henley-on-Thames. The tower's sole, octagonal-shaped room was an area that Harrison had adopted as his personal temple and meditation space. This picture was taken by photographer Barry Feinstein, whose Camouflage Productions partner, Tom Wilkes, originally used {{it as part of}} an elaborate poster intended as an insert in the album package. The poster featured a painting of the Hindu deity Krishna watching a group of naked maidens beside a bathing pond. Harrison apparently felt uncomfortable with the symbolism in Wilkes's design – the Friar Park tower image filled {{the top half of the}} poster, floating among clouds above the Krishna scene – so Wilkes abandoned <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>and</b> instead used a darkened photo of Harrison inside the house as the album poster. The more common picture sleeve internationally was a close-up of Feinstein's All Things Must Pass front-cover image, taken on the main lawn of Friar Park. In Denmark, the sleeve featured four shots of Harrison, again with guitar, taken on stage during the Delaney & Bonnie tour.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} Sholay {{began as a}} four-line snippet which screenwriter pair Salim-Javed told G. P.

The original idea of the film involved an army officer who decided to hire two ex-soldiers to avenge {{the murder of his}} family. The army officer was later changed to a policeman because Sippy felt that {{it would be difficult to}} get permission to shoot scenes depicting army activities. Salim-Javed completed the script in one month, incorporating names and personality traits of their friends and acquaintances.|$|E
