5|$|Canopus {{served in}} the Mediterranean Fleet upon {{commissioning}} until 1903, when she was decommissioned for refitting. In 1905, she was sent to East Asia, but <b>the</b> <b>renewal</b> of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance that year rendered her presence in Asian waters unnecessary. She instead returned to Britain and served with several fleet commands in British waters, including the Atlantic Fleet, the Channel Fleet, and finally the Home Fleet. Another short deployment to the Mediterranean followed in 1908–1909. Upon returning to Britain, she was placed in reserve.|$|E

5|$|Along with <b>the</b> <b>renewal</b> of {{the civil}} war in 1352, these factors {{destroyed}} any chance of even a modest recovery similar to that experienced under Andronikos III. Thereafter, Byzantium remained under the menacing threat of stronger neighbours, unable to pursue an independent foreign policy, handicapped by a shortage of resources and riven by internal strife. Nevertheless, through a combination of fortuitous external circumstances and adroit diplomacy, it survived for another century, until finally conquered by the Ottomans in 1453. Only the Byzantine exclave in the Morea remained prosperous, having been spared the ravages {{of the civil}} war because of its relative isolation. The appointment of Manuel Kantakouzenos as its despotes in 1349 heralded the creation of the semi-independent Despotate of the Morea, which experienced the last economic and cultural flowering of the Byzantine world before it too fell to the Ottomans in 1460.|$|E

40|$|School Renewal is {{a broadly}} defined process {{used as an}} {{alternative}} route to school improvement and regional accreditation. However {{there is no direct}} evidence to support its use. To date, there have been no systematic inquiries to document the regional accreditation process of improving an elementary and middle school through <b>the</b> School <b>Renewal</b> process. This study was an inquiry into <b>the</b> School <b>Renewal</b> accreditation process in an elementary and middle school. The study focused on the structure of <b>the</b> School <b>Renewal</b> process, <b>the</b> processes in which participants engaged, and the outcomes of <b>the</b> School <b>Renewal</b> process as related to planning, climate, communication, curriculum and instruction, and staff development. The design included a case study with a rich, descriptive, narrative format for reporting. The participants included the principal, assistant principal, all faculty and staff members, parents and community members of Honaker Elementary and Middle School who were members of one of <b>the</b> School <b>Renewal</b> committees. Data from documents, observations and interviews of participants, and the researcher's journal were analyzed to build a complete case narrative. The findings were organized into three major themes from <b>the</b> School <b>Renewal</b> process: <b>the</b> structure of school renewal; the processes of leadership including communication and involvement of participants in <b>the</b> School <b>Renewal</b> process; and <b>the</b> outcomes of school renewal.

5|$|In 1147 Manuel {{was faced}} with war by Roger II of Sicily, whose fleet had {{captured}} the Byzantine island of Corfu and plundered Thebes and Corinth. However, despite being distracted by a Cuman attack in the Balkans, in 1148 Manuel enlisted the alliance of Conrad III of Germany, and {{the help of the}} Venetians, who quickly defeated Roger with their powerful fleet. In 1149, Manuel recovered Corfu and prepared to take the offensive against the Normans, while Roger II sent George of Antioch with a fleet of 40 ships to pillage Constantinople's suburbs. Manuel had already agreed with Conrad on a joint invasion and partition of southern Italy and Sicily. <b>The</b> <b>renewal</b> of the German alliance remained the principal orientation of Manuel's foreign policy {{for the rest of his}} reign, despite the gradual divergence of interests between the two empires after Conrad's death.|$|E
5|$|In April 1903 a {{petition}} objecting to <b>the</b> <b>renewal</b> of alcohol licences for local inns, signed by 450 people, {{was presented to}} the Brewsters sessions (magistrates court meetings in England where pub licences were renewed or granted). A deputation sent to the session explained that the number of licensed houses was too large in proportion to the population. In 1917, the cattle market moved from the Higher Bullring to a field near the station. The first cinema was opened in the Victoria Hall in 1918 by Bill Terry and in 1977 the town was twinned with Ploudalmézeau in Brittany, France.|$|E

5|$|The Fasci Siciliani , {{short for}} Fasci Siciliani dei Lavoratori (Sicilian Workers Leagues), were a popular {{movement}} of democratic and socialist inspiration, which arose in Sicily {{in the years}} between 1889 and 1894.

5|$|The Sangam {{literature}} of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was being ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and South-East Asia. In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women. By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created in the greater Ganges Plain a complex system of administration and taxation that became a model for later Indian kingdoms. Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself. <b>The</b> <b>renewal</b> was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.
