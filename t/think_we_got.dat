5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> it right.|$|E

It's all about casting and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> really lucky in all five of these regulars." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the band}} entered 2016, Cain felt {{the future for}} the group was bright: [...] "We're not done yet. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> more music in us," [...] he told Substream Magazine in January 2016. Two months later the band {{announced}} their break-up with a statement that read in part, [...] "We {{have no idea what}} the future holds, but for now we are done." [...] The band embarked on the So Long, Farewell Tour across North America between May and September 2016 with original drummer Tony Thaxton returning. They performed their final, sold-out show at the Metro in Chicago on September 18, 2016. The group performed 36 songs — some dating back to their 2000 EP, Back to the Beat — while both Thaxton and Rivera sat in on drums.|$|E

500|$|The {{series was}} officially {{canceled}} by ABC on May 13, 2010. In {{an interview with}} New York Magazine, Victor Fresco, the show's creator, was asked why he thought the show didn't catch on. He responded, [...] "I think not enough people knew about it. It wasn’t like {{we had a lot}} of people watch it and they didn’t come back to it. If anything, I think we were building slowly, but to me the way TV works is you spend a lot of money advertising and promoting, or you have to let a show stay some place for a long period of time and an audience slowly comes to it. And I don’t <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> either of that". Fresco also added, [...] "I still feel there’s an audience out there for it, because I know that the people who liked it, liked it a lot." ...|$|E
500|$|When Project 86 {{released}} their self-titled record, {{they were}} generally acknowledged to be a rapcore band. Schwab has maintained {{it was never}} intentional, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> lumped in with that music because we [...] toured with P.O.D. and Linkin Park." [...] According to writer Mark Allan Powell, the music featured [...] "cryptic, down-tuned guitars" [...] and [...] "half-spoken, half-rapped" [...] vocals. Drawing Black Lines saw their style adopt elements of traditional metal, groove metal, and hard rock. The band used their song [...] "Pipedream" [...] as a blueprint to build the album: [...] "We knew {{that was one of}} the brightest spots on the album," [...] said Schwab, [...] "I just wanted to take what we did in 'Pipedream' and go further with it". Experimentation with noise occurred in track [...] "Twenty-Three", and would be revisited on their fourth album with [...] "Circuitry".|$|E
500|$|Some People Change was Montgomery Gentry's lowest-selling album at the time. Joe Galante, then-president of Sony Music Nashville, {{thought that}} the album's poor sales were because it [...] "strayed musically from what the base had been. They have an edge to their sound, and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a little too soft." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times gave a mixed review, {{saying that it was}} more [...] "touchy-feely" [...] than You Do Your Thing, and that [...] "no one works a snarling country chorus like Montgomery Gentry". Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "C", criticizing the duo for the {{contradictory}} viewpoints of personal changes on the title track versus the [...] "defense of the American right to piss off your neighbors" [...] in [...] "What Do Ya Think About That". Jurek comparatively called it a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and said that it was [...] "a new pinnacle for the duo", calling the title track [...] "one of those tunes that defines something that {{lies at the heart of}} what is good about Americans." ...|$|E

The guy in the surgical scrubs is my friend Joel Miller. The woman in the foreground with her legs crossed is my first-cousin-once-removed Tammy (who also played Queen Amidala in my video for [...] "The Saga Begins"). Uh Jeff, the guy that screens my fan mail, is the guy wearing the NY Yankees cap way in the back. Steve Jay's son Ian is the really tall blond bicycle messenger. Tracy Berna, one of the writers for The Weird Al Show, is the waitress with the beehive hair-do. The Boy Scout is Dylan Bostick, the oldest son of one of Suzanne's oldest friends. Bermuda's wife Leslie is in there too. Plus there’s my mother-in-law, my father-in-law, my electrician, a couple from my church, the owner of my favorite ice cream shop, my aunt's boyfriend… I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> maybe 2 or 3 people from the casting office, but the overwhelming majority were friends and family members that just wanted to come to the shoot.|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, some users also {{alleged that}} their Windows 7 and 8.1 devices had {{automatically}} begun upgrading to 10 without their consent. In June 2016, the GWX dialog's behavior changed to make closing the window imply a consent to a scheduled upgrade. Despite this, an Infoworld editor disputed the claims that upgrades had begun without any consent at all; testing {{showed that the}} upgrade to Windows10 would only begin once the user accepts the end-user license agreement (EULA) presented by its installer, and that not doing so would eventually cause Windows Update to time out with an error, thus halting the installation attempt. It was concluded that these users may have unknowingly clicked the [...] "Accept" [...] prompt without full knowledge that this would begin the upgrade. In December 2016, Microsoft chief marketing officer Chris Capossela admitted {{that the company had}} [...] "gone too far", by using this tactic, stating that [...] "we know we want people to be running Windows 10 from a security perspective, but finding the right balance where you’re not stepping over the line of being too aggressive is something we tried and {{for a lot of the}} year I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> it right." ...|$|E
500|$|... "You're Not Sorry" [...] {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics. Rob Sheffield of Blender magazine received [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] negatively {{and used the}} word [...] "drippy" [...] to describe it. Sheffield added that, in the song, by comparison, [...] "she reminds you what a smart job she normally does of keeping the tempo jumping." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine believed [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] {{was one of the}} songs on Fearless that expanded on the success of Swift's eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift (2006), because of how prominently its hook stands out. Craig Rosen of The Hollywood Reporter said [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] was ostentatious in regards to Swift's crossover potential. Nick Catucci of New York magazine read an article posted in The New York Times, which stated Swift [...] "quickly established herself as the most remarkable country music breakthrough artist of the decade", and opted his own opinion, based on the song. Catucci said, [...] "And indeed, we <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a little fairy dust in our eyes listening to 'You're Not Sorry' [...] isn't the stuff of redneck women but earnest suburban princesses," [...] despite that he had listened to better songs in the past decade. Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette compared [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] to a [...] "chanteuse a la Tori Amos".|$|E

2500|$|Unferth {{is portrayed}} by John Malkovich. Malkovich became {{involved}} in the project because one of his friends, who had worked with Zemeckis, [...] "spoke very highly of him. I had always found him a very interesting and innovative filmmaker. I liked the script very much and I liked the group involved and the process interested me a great deal also." [...] He found the experience of working with motion capture to be similar to his experiences working in the theater. He also found the process intriguing: [...] "Say you do a normal day of filmmaking. Sometimes that’s 1/8 of a page, sometimes it’s 3/8th of a page, normally let’s say it’s 2½ pages, maybe 3. Now it’s probably a little more {{than it used to be}} but not always. So you may be acting for a total of 20 minutes a day. In this, you act the entire day all the time except for the tiny amount of time it takes them to sort of coordinate the computer information, let’s say, and make sure that the computers are reading the data and that you’re transmitting the data. It interests me on that level because I’m a professional actor so I’d just as soon act as sit around." [...] Malkovich also recalled that he studied the original poem in high school, and that “I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> smacked if we couldn’t recite a certain number of stanzas. It was in the Old English class and I think my rendition was exemplary." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{must have}} given him the letter myself, for I have no {{recollection}} of parting with it before, but I only remember his offering me his hand, and making me shyly and tentatively welcome. After {{a few moments of}} the demoralization which followed his hospitable attempts in me, he asked if I would not like to go up on his hill with him and sit there, where he smoked in the afternoon. He offered me a cigar, and when I said that I did not smoke, he lighted it for himself, and we climbed the hill together. At the top, where there was an outlook in the pines over the Concord meadows, we found a log, and he invited me to a place on it beside him, and at intervals of a minute or so he talked while he smoked. Heaven preserved me from the folly of trying to tell him how much his books had been to me, and though we got on rapidly at no time, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> on better for this interposition. He asked me about Lowell, I dare say, for I told him of my joy in meeting him and Doctor Holmes, and this seemed greatly to interest him. Perhaps because he was so lately from Europe, where our great men are always seen through the wrong end of the telescope, he appeared surprised at my devotion, and asked me whether I cared as much for meeting them as I should care for meeting the famous English authors. I professed that I cared much more, though whether this was true, I now have my doubts, and I think Hawthorne doubted it at the time. But he said nothing in comment, and went on to speak generally of Europe and America. He was curious about the West, which be seemed to fancy much more purely American, and {{said he would like to}} see some part of the country on which the shadow (or, if I must be precise, the damned shadow) of Europe had not fallen. I told him I thought the West must finally be characterized by the Germans, whom we had in great numbers, and, purely from my zeal for German poetry, I tried to allege some proofs of their present influence, though I could think of none outside of politics, which I thought they affected wholesomely. I knew Hawthorne was a Democrat, and I felt it well to touch politics lightly, but he had no more to say about the fateful election then pending than Holmes or Lowell had.|$|E
