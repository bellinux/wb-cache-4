50|$|The French {{expeditionary force}} {{at the time was}} led by General Charles de Lorencez. The battle came about by a {{misunderstanding}} of the French forces’ agreement to withdraw to the coast. When the Mexican Republic forces saw these French soldiers on the march, they took it that hostilities had recommenced and felt threatened. To add to the mounting concerns, it was discovered that political negotiations for the withdrawal had broken down.A vehement complaint was lodged by the Mexicans to General Lorencez who took the effrontery as a plan to assail his forces. Lorencez decided to hold up his withdrawal to the coast by occupying Orizaba instead, which prevented the Mexicans from being able to defend the passes between Orizaba and <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>port</b> of Veracruz. The 33-year-old Mexican Commander General, Ignacio Zaragoza, fell back to Acultzingo Pass where he and his army were badly beaten in a skirmish with Lorencez's forces on 28 April. Zaragoza retreated to Puebla which was heavily fortified - it had been held by the Mexican government since the Reform War. To its north stood the forts Loreto and Guadalupe on opposite hilltops. Zaragoza had a trench dug to join the forts via the saddle.|$|E
50|$|After Twinsen {{defeated}} FunFrock {{at the end}} of Little Big Adventure, Twinsun was peaceful, until {{a sudden}} storm covered Citadel Island. The Dino-Fly, a creature encountered in LBA 1 is struck by lightning and crashes in Twinsen and Zoe's garden. Twinsen seeks help from Ker'aooc, a healing wizard, who lives on Desert Island. But ferry crossings are cancelled. He aids Bersimon, the island's weather wizard, resulting in the clouds disappearing. After the storm, alien creatures, who call themselves Esmers, land on the planet, under a false diplomatic guise and Twinsen begins training under the Wizard's School after hearing of missing children on the planet. The Esmers use their army to secretly capture Twinsun's Children and openly invite the Wizards to their planet(which is revealed later to be a trap to capture them). After graduating as a Wizard, Twinsen is informed by his master of the possible plot of the Esmers and is sent to investigate their planet by accepting their invitation to all Wizards. Once Twinsen lands in Zeelich (the Esmers' two-layered, Jupiter-like gas home planet), the invitation proves to be a trap and he is arrested on <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>port.</b> After tricking one of the guards with the help of another prisoner, Twinsen manages to escape imprisonment and escapes the planet in one of the ships. He eventually crashes in the mountains of Citadel Island, where he is attacked by an Esmerian soldier, after defeating him and making his way into the city he finds out that the Esmers have taken over the planet and have imposed martial law. After going home to check on Zoe he finds out that Baldino has left him a protopack (Prototype Jetpack; it can hover, not fly) in the warehouse, he retrieves it and sets out to find his friend. Once making it to Desert Island he finds out that Baldino has disappeared, he proceeds to investigate his house and discovers that Baldino has built a spacecraft and for some reason went to Emerald Moon (Twinsun's moon). He visits the Wizard's School and learns from his master that in order to proceed in his journey and face the Esmers, who prove to be more than he can handle, he must obtain a powerful artifact from beneath Citadel Island.|$|E
40|$|Research PaperJapanese salmon {{fishery is}} facing a {{juncture}} of existence and pressed {{for the improvement of}} constitution. The decline of high-seas salmon fisheries was taken and the import amount increased rapidly. In addition, domestic production by coastal set net fisheries has increased with a success of salmon enhancement in Japan. Salmon market has internationalized consequently, decreasing wholesale prices of domestic salmon in Japan. Factors on short-term and long-term changes in the wholesale prices of salmon at the main landing port in Hokkaido were examined. The wholesale price increased in the year when the landing amount of salmon decreased from the previous year. A negative correlation between the landing amount and prices of salmon at <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>port</b> indicated that the prices of salmon were influenced by the landing amount. It was also that clarified that the import amount of salmon influenced the wholesale price of salmon. The wholesale price of salmon in the entire Hokkaido showed the long-term variability depending on the amount of imported salmon, and the wholesale price of salmon in the regions showed the short-term variability depending on the amount of landing salmon. Factors on wholesale price function of salmon in Japan were analyzed by econometric method. It was clarified that wholesale price of fresh salmon decreased when inventory amount of fresh salmon or import amount of fresh salmon increased and wholesale price of fresh salmon decreased when inventory amount of salted salmon roe and fishery production of fresh salmon increased. Increase in the inventory amount of fresh salmon in recent years was caused because of increase in the import amount of fresh salmon produced by aquaculture in winter...|$|E
