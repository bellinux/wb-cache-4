These investigations, which had originally argued against saccharin use, were shown to prove little about saccharin being harmful to human health. In 1977, the FDA made an attempt to completely ban the substance, following studies showing that the substance caused cancer in rats. The attempted ban was unsuccessful due to public opposition that was encouraged by industry advertisements, and instead the following label was mandated: [...] "Use of this product may be hazardous <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>health.</b> This product contains saccharin which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals". That requirement was dropped in 2000 following new research that concluded humans reacted differently than rats and were not at risk of cancer at typical intake levels. (See also: labeling below.) The sweetener has continued to be widely used in the United States and is now the third-most popular artificial sweetener behind sucralose and aspartame.|$|E

2500|$|In 1987, the DSM-IIIR {{category}} [...] "psychoactive substance abuse," [...] {{which includes}} former concepts {{of drug abuse}} is defined as [...] "a maladaptive pattern of use indicated by...continued use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent social, occupational, psychological or physical problem that is caused or exacerbated by the use (or by) recurrent use in situations {{in which it is}} physically hazardous." [...] It is a residual category, with dependence taking precedence when applicable. It was the first definition to give equal weight to behavioural and physiological factors in diagnosis. By 1988, the DSM-IV defines substance dependence as [...] "a syndrome involving compulsive use, with or without tolerance and withdrawal"; whereas substance abuse is [...] "problematic use without compulsive use, significant tolerance, or withdrawal." [...] Substance abuse can be harmful <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>health</b> and may even be deadly in certain scenarios. By 1994, The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) issued by the American Psychiatric Association, the DSM-IV-TR, defines substance dependence as [...] "when an individual persists in use of alcohol or other drugs despite problems related to use of the substance, substance dependence may be diagnosed."
