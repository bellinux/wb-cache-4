5|$|Generally the {{jumping spider}} {{subfamily}} Spartaeinae, {{which includes the}} genus Portia, cannot discriminate objects at such long distances as the members of subfamilies Salticinae or Lyssomaninae can.

The main eyes of a Portia can also identify features of <b>the</b> <b>scenery</b> up to 85times its own body length, which helps the spider to find detours.|$|E
