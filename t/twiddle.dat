25|$|By far {{the most}} {{commonly}} used FFT is the Cooley–Tukey algorithm. This is a divide and conquer algorithm that recursively breaks down a DFT of any composite size N = N1N2 into many smaller DFTs of sizes N1 and N2, along with O(N) multiplications by complex roots of unity traditionally called <b>twiddle</b> factors (after Gentleman and Sande, 1966).|$|E
25|$|For N = N1N2 with coprime N1 and N2, {{one can use}} the prime-factor (Good–Thomas) {{algorithm}} (PFA), {{based on}} the Chinese remainder theorem, to factorize the DFT similarly to Cooley–Tukey but without the <b>twiddle</b> factors. The Rader–Brenner algorithm (1976) is a Cooley–Tukey-like factorization but with purely imaginary <b>twiddle</b> factors, reducing multiplications {{at the cost of}} increased additions and reduced numerical stability; it was later superseded by the split-radix variant of Cooley–Tukey (which achieves the same multiplication count but with fewer additions and without sacrificing accuracy). Algorithms that recursively factorize the DFT into smaller operations other than DFTs include the Bruun and QFT algorithms. (The Rader–Brenner and QFT algorithms were proposed for power-of-two sizes, but it is possible that they could be adapted to general composite n. Bruun's algorithm applies to arbitrary even composite sizes.) Bruun's algorithm, in particular, is based on interpreting the FFT as a recursive factorization of the polynomial z'N−1, here into real-coefficient polynomials of the form z'M−1 and z2M+az'M+1.|$|E
25|$|In the {{introductory}} section, it was claimed that M-Theory allows to learn invariant representations. This is because templates and their transformed versions {{can be learned}} from visual experience - by exposing the system to sequences of transformations of objects. It is plausible that similar visual experiences occur in early period of human life, for instance when infants <b>twiddle</b> toys in their hands. Because templates may be totally unrelated to images that the system later will try to classify, memories of these visual experiences may serve as a basis for recognizing many different kinds of objects in later life. However, as it is shown later, for some kinds of transformations, specific templates are needed.|$|E

He said, [...] "You can literally <b>twiddle</b> a knob and the depth will increase", and, [...] "the trick is not to overdo it". In December 2011, Rapace undertook additional dialogue recordings for the film. Additional pick-up scenes were filmed during January 2012, including a one-day shoot on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, and a new scene shot at a cave in the Scottish mountains. For dark scenes, the film was color graded to specifically compensate for the light loss of 3D glasses, to ensure the image was comparable to the 2D version.|$|E

2500|$|Even the [...] "exact" [...] FFT {{algorithms}} have errors when finite-precision floating-point arithmetic is used, {{but these}} errors are typically quite small; most FFT algorithms, e.g. Cooley–Tukey, have excellent numerical properties {{as a consequence}} of the pairwise summation structure of the algorithms. [...] The upper bound on the relative error for the Cooley–Tukey algorithm is O(ε log N), compared to O(εN3/2) for the naïve DFT formula, where ε is the machine floating-point relative precision. In fact, the root mean square (rms) errors are much better than these upper bounds, being only O(ε √log N) for Cooley–Tukey and O(ε √N) for the naïve DFT (Schatzman, 1996). These results, however, are very sensitive to the accuracy of the <b>twiddle</b> factors used in the FFT (i.e. the trigonometric function values), and it is not unusual for incautious FFT implementations to have much worse accuracy, e.g. if they use inaccurate trigonometric recurrence formulas. Some FFTs other than Cooley–Tukey, such as the Rader–Brenner algorithm, are intrinsically less stable.|$|E

She rose, advanced two steps, made a majestic curtsey, during which all the bugles in her awful head-dress began to <b>twiddle</b> and quiver--and then said, 'Mr. Snob, we are very {{happy to see you}} at the Evergreens,' and heaved a great sigh.|$|E
