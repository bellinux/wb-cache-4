5|$|Death {{has always}} been a {{critical}} moment for those bereaved, and consequently death is surrounded by taboo-like rules. Family life has to be reorganized and in order to master such transitions, people use rites. The ceremonies are transitional rites that are intended to give the deceased peace in his or her new situation {{at the same time as}} they provide strength for <b>the</b> <b>bereaved</b> to carry on with their lives.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} after the war, veterans, <b>the</b> <b>bereaved</b> {{and the rest of}} society focused, to the point of obsession, with the problem of death. There was {{tremendous}} interest in creating war memorials that celebrated the themes of glory, heroism and loss. In part, there was a rupture or dislocation with the pre-war norms of how memorials should look and feel; communities sought to find new, radical ways to mourn the millions of dead, killed in an essentially modern conflict. In other ways, the building of memorials drew on traditional forms and ideas, drawing on existing religious and architectural themes to explore loss and grief.|$|E
5|$|Davies's Merthyr {{constituency}} {{included the}} mining village of Aberfan, situated {{a few miles}} south of Merthyr Tydfil. On the mountainsides above the village, colliery waste had been dumped {{over the years to}} form large spoil tips. Shortly after 9:00 am on Friday 21 October 1966 one of these tips collapsed, sending thousands of tons of semi-liquid waste hurtling towards Aberfan. The point of impact was Pantglas Junior School, where morning lessons were beginning. The school was half buried; inside, 109 children and 5 teachers were killed. A further 7 children and 23 adults lost their lives outside the school, in the streets or adjoining houses. In the immediate aftermath, Davies visited and consoled <b>the</b> <b>bereaved</b> families in Aberfan, and the following day he led a party which included the Duke of Edinburgh {{on a tour of the}} disaster site.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} collaboration and learning to cope with grief in Denise Desautels' poetic works. It shows that this writing strategy influences the representation of mourning and contributes to the learning process, which {{is characterized by a}} constant oscillation between opposing poles, such as life and death, the past and present, the self and other, the private and public realms, as well as art and writing. The thesis further demonstrates that Desautels' development of an interdisciplinary approach gives rise to a community of <b>the</b> <b>bereaving</b> and enables <b>the</b> poetic subject to distance herself from melancholy in order to foster a new aim toward happiness. It concludes that the mourning process never reaches completion, but is constantly renegotiated...|$|R
50|$|There was {{internal}} conflict which was mostly frustration toward the Perfect. <b>The</b> author <b>bereaves</b> <b>the</b> elevated {{status of the}} Perfect, likening them unto “perfect” examples of the human race, one in which all humans can look to and model after.

Everyone had something against them, the poor thought the Perfect as wealthy and comfortable, the starving thought all the Perfect did was recline and eat the best foods.|$|R
