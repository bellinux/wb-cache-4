500|$|The {{experiment}} {{consisted of}} making audio recordings of a Toyota Prius and combustion engine Honda Accord approaching from two directions at [...] {{to assure that}} the hybrid car operated only with its electric motor. Then test subjects in a laboratory listened to the recordings and indicated when they could hear from which direction the cars approached. Subjects could locate <b>the</b> <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> internal combustion engine car at [...] away, but could not identify the hybrid running in electric mode until it came within , leaving just less than two seconds to react before the vehicle reached their position. In a second trial, the background sounds of two quietly idling combustion engine cars were added to the recordings to simulate the noise of a parking lot. Under this condition, the hybrid needed to be 74 percent closer than the conventional car before the subjects could hear from which direction the cars approached. Subjects could correctly judge the approach of the combustion car when it was about [...] feet away. This result means that under closer to normal environmental noise, a pedestrian {{would not be able to}} correctly determine the hybrid's approach until it was one second away.|$|E

30|$|It {{is often}} the case that the {{original}} music file includes the whole song, while a user <b>hums</b> <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song.

In addition, a user can hum faster or slower as compared to the original music file, and some parts can be missing or added during humming. Thus, a matcher that can solve these problems should be considered; the DTW method [13 – 15, 18] was used in this study. DTW matching is mainly used to measure the dissimilarity between two waveforms through insertion and deletion.|$|R
