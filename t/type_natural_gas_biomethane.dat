40|$|This paper assesses {{and compares}} {{existing}} and new technologies for space heating in Germany (e. g., heat pumps, and solar thermal and wood pellet systems) {{in terms of}} their environmental impacts. The various technologies were analyzed {{within the context of the}} new German legislation. The assessment was carried out on three levels: 1. Global emissions: a life cycle assessment was carried out in order to find the global environmental footprint of the various technologies; 2. Local emissions: the effects of local emissions on human health were analyzed; and 3. Immissions: the immissions were evaluated for the various technologies using a dispersion calculation. A special feature of this study is the substitution of frequently used database emission values by values obtained from field studies and our own measurements. The results show large differences between the different technologies: while electric heat pumps performed quite well in most categories, wood pellet systems performed the best with respect to climate change. The latter, however, are associated with high impacts in other environmental impact categories and on a local scale. The promotion of some technologies (especially systems based on fuel oil, a mixture of fuel oil and rapeseed oil, or a mixture of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> and <b>biomethane)</b> by the newly introduced German legislation is doubtful. In terms of the immissions of wood pellet systems, it can be concluded that, even for extremely unfavorable meteorological conditions, the regulatory limits are not exceeded and the heating systems have a negligible influence on the total PM load in the ambient air. heating systems; life cycle assessment; immissions; particulate matter; dispersion calculation...|$|R

Syngas fermentation has potential in this context, as a diverse range of low-biodegradable materials that can be used. In this study, anaerobic sludge acclimatized to syngas in a multi-orifice baffled bioreactor (MOBB) was used to start enrichments with CO. The main goals were to identify the key players in CO conversion and evaluate potential interspecies metabolic interactions conferring robustness to the process. Anaerobic sludge incubated with 0. 7 × 105 Pa CO produced methane and acetate. When the antibiotics vancomycin and/or erythromycin were added, no methane was produced, indicating that direct methanogenesis from CO did not occur. Acetobacterium and Sporomusa were the predominant bacterial species in CO-converting enrichments, together with methanogens from the genera Methanobacterium and Methanospirillum. Subsequently, a highly enriched culture mainly composed of a Sporomusa sp. was obtained that could convert up to 1. 7 × 105 Pa CO to hydrogen and acetate. These results attest the role of Sporomusa species in the enrichment as primary CO utilizers and show their importance for methane production as conveyers of hydrogen to methanogens present in the culture...|$|R

Other utilization pathways, such as biomethane injection into the <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> grid or <b>biomethane</b> used as a vehicle fuel, remain unexplored. Given the dense grid of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> pipelines and existing Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) refueling stations in northern Italy, significant market opportunities for biogas could also arise in the heating and transport sectors. The main objectives of this paper are to explore the potential role of agricultural biogas in different utilization pathways. Biogas combustion for simultaneous production of heat and power in small Combined Heat and Power (CHP) facilities is also assessed, as is upgrading to biomethane for transport or <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> grid injection {{in the specific context}} of northern Italy. The spatially explicit optimization model BeWhere is used to identify optimal locations where greenfield biogas plants could be installed and to determine the most economic and environmentally beneficial mix of conversion technologies and plant capacities. Carbon price, for instance in the form of tradable emission permits, is assessed as a policy instrument and compared with other options such as price premiums on biomethane or electricity costs. Results show that starting from a carbon price of 15 EUR/tCO(2), the cogeneration option is preferable if plants are located in the proximity of existing district heating infrastructure. CNG plants are only competitive starting at a carbon price of 70 EUR/tCO(2) in areas with high feedstock availability. The sensitivity analysis for energy prices reveals that a larger number of CNG facilities are included in the optimal mix at higher gas wholesale prices. This further indicates that specific premiums are needed to expand the biomethane market share, while greenhouse gas emission reductions would primarily be achieved by fostering cogeneration of electricity and heat supported by carbon price-based policy instruments...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} the daily gas demand in the UK and Ireland has become {{increasingly}} uncertain. This due to {{the changing nature of}} electricity markets, where intermittent wind energy levels lead to variations in the demand for gas needed to produce electricity. As a result, there is an increasing need for models of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> markets that include stochastic demand. In this thesis, a Rolling Optimisation Model (ROM) of the UK <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> market is introduced. It takes as an input demand scenarios simulated from a stochastic process of UK gas demand which is developed as a part of this work. The model is informed by an analysis of the two main <b>types</b> of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> market models: complementarity-based equilibrium models and cost minimisation models. This analysis shows that when market power (i. e. Nash-Cournot competition) is removed from complementarity-based equilibrium models the outputs are equivalent to those from a corresponding cost minimisation model. The outputs of the Rolling Optimisation Model are the ows of gas in the UK, i. e., how the different sources of supply meet demand, as well as how gas ows in to and out of gas storage facilities, and the daily System Average Price of gas in the UK. The model was found to t reasonably well to historic data (from the UK National Grid) for the years starting on the 1 st of April for both 2010 and 2011. This work also investigates the bene t of using scenario reduction techniques on the set of demand scenarios used in ROM. These techniques allow the effects of large sets of stochastically-generated scenarios to be captured in ROM, whilst maintaining a relatively low computational cost for solving the model.
