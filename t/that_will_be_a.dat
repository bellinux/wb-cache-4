25|$|In {{attempting}} to explain similar criticisms manifest in other countries, some academics {{have argued that}} global structures of gender often butt heads with more culture-specific concepts, resulting in tension between the imposed and traditional gender and/or sexual norms. According to one study, this tension in Japan is likely to lessen over successive generations, as holders of traditional views tend to belong to an older cohort of the population. Others argue that the tension between global and local concepts of gender will eventually resolve {{in the establishment of}} a third system <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> unique conglomeration of traditional and global gender norms for a particular region.|$|E

Predicted in Brahma-vaivarta Purana 4.129. The fourth part of the Brahma-vaivarta is called Kṛṣṇa-janma-khanda. Chapter 129 is called Golokarohanam, because it describes how Krishna returns to His abode. This specific dialogue is between Lord Krishna and Mother Ganga. Verse 49 is a question by Ganga, verses 50–60 are Lord Sri Krishna's answer.|$|E
25|$|Madrid’s Pride Parade {{began in}} 1977, in the Chueca neighbourhood, which also marked the {{beginning}} of the gay, lesbian, transgender, and bisexual rights movement after being repressed for forty years in a dictatorship. This claiming of LGBT rights has allowed the Pride Parade in Madrid to grow year after year, becoming one of the best in the world. In 2007, this was recognised by the European Pride Owners Association (EPOA) when Madrid hosted Europride, the Official European Pride Parade. It was hailed by the President of the EPOA as “the best Europride in history”. In 2017, Madrid plans on celebrating the 40th anniversary of their first Pride Parade with WorldPride Madrid 2017. This festival will be the host of many conferences, seminars, workshops, cultural and sports activities, and a “kids and family pride” <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> source of education.

500|$|The {{reception}} to Quicksilver {{was generally}} positive. Some reviewers found the length cumbersome; however, others found the length impressive in its quality and entertainment value.
