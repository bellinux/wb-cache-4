50|$|Today, {{the dolls}} at the Käthe Kruse Manufactory in Donauwörth are still made by hand. The bodies are either made with muslin and stuffed with {{reindeer}} hair, or have an inner wire skeleton covered with <b>tricot</b> <b>knitting.</b> The heads {{are made of}} fabric, papier maché or polystyrene and hand painted. Many have wigs knitted from real hair or mohair. Over the years, Käthe's daughter and successor, Hanne Adler-Kruse, introduced new items made of velour or terrycloth for babies.|$|E
50|$|A {{headliner}} {{often is}} a composite material that is adhered to the inside roof of automobiles or yachts. It typically consists of a face fabric with nonwoven or foam backing. Headliners consist of multilayered composite materials that bring together multiple functionalities, including the requested look, feel, stiffness, and sound reduction needed in cars. Automotive headliners are optimised with respect to head impact counter measures or to integrate additional LED lighting film behind the fabric. Most headliners consist of a <b>tricot</b> <b>knit</b> fabric that is napped to provide a soft touch and uniform appearance. The fabric is adhered to melted polyurethane foam. This fabric-foam composite is glued to the interior fiberglass roof of the automobile.|$|R
40|$|The {{anomalous}} plasma around spacecrafts in low Earth orbit {{represents the}} coma of an artificial comet. The plasma discharge {{is caused by}} an energetic disturbance of charged particles which were formerly {{in a state of}} equilibrium. The plasma can effect the passive and active radio frequency operation of large space antennas by inducing corona discharge or strong arcing in the antenna feeds. One such large space antenna is the 15 -meter hoop column antenna which consists of a mesh membrane material (<b>tricot</b> <b>knitted</b> gold plated wire) reflector and carbon fiber tension cords. The atomic oxygen in the plasma discharge state can force the wire base metal particles through the gold lattice and oxydize the metal particles to build a Schottky-barrier contact {{at the point where the}} wires meet. This effect can cause strong deviations in the reflector performance in terms of antenna pattern and losses. Also, the carbon-fiber cords can experience a strength reduction of 30 percent over a 40 -hour exposure time...|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{satellite}} communications systems require large, high gain antennas at the spacecraft {{to minimize the}} antenna gain and power requirements for mobile user elements. The use of a deployable reflector antenna for these applications provides a lightweight system that can be compactly stowed prior to deployment on orbit. The mesh surface material is a critical component in the deployable reflector antenna design. The mesh is required to provide the desired electrical performance {{as well as the}} mechanical properties that are necessary to deploy and maintain the reflector surface on orbit. Of particular interest in multi-channel communications applications is the generation of Passive InterModulation (PIM) products at the reflector surface that can result in interference in the receive band. Wire mesh was specifically identified by some as having a high potential for PIM generation based solely on the existence of nonpermanent metal to metal contacts at the junctions that are inherent in the mesh design. There {{are a number of other}} factors, however, that reduce the likelihood of PIM occurring at the mesh reflector surface. Experimental data presented demonstrate that mesh PIM generation is not significant for typical applications. PIM and reflectivity performance of wire mesh composed of gold plated molybdenum wire in a <b>tricot</b> <b>knit</b> are described. This type of mesh was successfully used for the deployable Single Access Antennas of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the reproducibility of repeated measurements with the Kikuhime pressure sensor under {{two different types of}} pressure garments used in the treatment and prevention of scars after burns. Also efficiency of garments was assessed in clinical circumstances by assessing pressure loss and residual pressure after 1 month. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility and repeated measurements with 1 -month time lapse were examined on 55 sites in 26 subjects by means of intra-class correlation coefficients and standard error of measurements. Results showed good to excellent ICC and low SEMs in the two conditions. There was a significant difference in pressure after 1 month between elastic <b>tricot</b> and weft <b>knit</b> garments, although evolution of pressure loss after 1 month was similar. Concerning different locations, {{there was a significant difference}} in pressure loss after 1 month between gloves and sleeves with the largest pressure loss for sleeves. Considering these results we concluded that the Kikuhime pressure sensor provides valid and reliable information and can be used in comparative clinical trials to evaluate pressure garments used in burn scar treatment. Secondly, elastic tricot garments in our study tended to have higher clinical pressures but both types of garments had similar pressure loss over time. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Rise of {{the textile}} and {{clothing}} industry that operating in Turkey {{for many years}} has reached huge proportions today. It isknown by everyone that our country compete with large geographies in this sector. The location of the textile industry in privatesector has growed day by day {{in recent years and}} this situation has brought about at the same rate of change. So the eyes havebeen turned to education which unique key of the change and the necessity was born that to be shown great interest to theprogramme of the textile ready - made clothing in Turkish education system. This research fronts to textile ready - made clothingeducation subject and it focuses on factors that affect the election of the programme of the textile ready - made clothing that isapplied in Anatolian Professional High Schools, Anatolian Maiden Professional High Schools and Maiden Professional HighSchools and the demand rate to the programme (Konya, Karaman and Aksaray provinces). The universe of this study is the students of the programme of the textile ready - made clothing in Anatolian ProfessionalHigh Schools, Anatolian Maiden Professional High Schools and Maiden Professional High Schools that hold the programme ofthe textile ready - made clothing. Specimens are composed of the pupils doing the programme of the textile ready - made clothingin Anatolian Professional High Schools, Anatolian Maiden Professional High Schools and Maiden Professional High Schools from Konya, Karaman and Aksaray. Totally 418 textile ready - made clothing students 9. 10. and 11. classes in these provincesand in their towns have been included in this study. Survey method was applied in this research. The basic informations that can be reached via internet and literature will be usedin the context of this survey model. Than a poll has been applied to the students to determine the factors that have an effect onstudents to opt for textile ready - made clothing programme. In addition to this the headmasters of the schools have beeninterviewed and the demand for the programme of the textile ready - made clothing in these schools has been determined. Allfindings have been showed by the tables and graphs with the percentage and frequency calculations. With the aim of showing upthe relation ship between some factors with each other among these factors x 2 (khi - square) test has been applied and the resultsthat came out from them have been tabulated. According to the findings of the study, so many factors which affect the programme of the textile ready - made clothing havebeen determined. It is possible to group these factors as close environment (family, friends, relatives, guidance teachers), externalenvironment (the famous fashion designers, artists, teachers, academic members, company owners, workshop leaders, stylists,designers, tailors and, models, etc.), textile ready - made clothing symbols (showcases, fashion shows, fashion bulletins, fashionmagazines, textile magazines, fashion channels, brands, fabrics, the new model sewing machines, sewing equipment, dress forms,clothing accessories, etc [...] ), the various aspects of the programme of the textile ready - made clothing (conceptual, design, cutting,sewing, etc [...] ), the subsections of the programme of the textile ready - made clothing (Branch of the Child Clothing Design,Branch of the Sock Knitting, Branch of the Leather Ready - To - Wear, Branch of the Weaving Surface Apparel, Branch of theFlatbed <b>Knitting</b> (<b>tricot)</b> Ready - To - Wear, Branch of the Men's Clothing Design, Branch of the Men's Tailoring, Branch of theHome Textile Apparel, Branch of the Underwear Styler, Branch of the Underwear Design, Branch of the Women's ClothingDesign, Branch of the Pattern, Branch of the Quality Control (Production Controller), Branch of the Cut, Branch of the MaterialQuality Control, Branch of the Fashion-House Boutique (dressmaking), Branch of the Embroidery of the Textile and GarmentIndustry, Branch of the Textile and Garment Machinery Mechatronics, Branch of the Circular Knitting Apparel), somevocational/academic factors, (becoming skilful in order to sew, becoming skilful in order to work in a factory/an establishment,to earn a reputation in the textile sector in Turkey/abroad, get a bachelor degree and a master’s degree in this department, gainingthe ability to begin a business by dint of education that to be earned), some emotional reasons (to love sewing, to like usingcreativeness, thinking the world of figures who is fashion designers in the some television series, movies or televisionprogrammes, to be interested in technological products with regard to apparel industry, thinking the world of the textile ready -made clothing teachers, to like things which is producted by the neighbours, relatives etc. worked in this sector),vocational/academic status of the textile ready - made clothing programme’s the former graduates, the guidance service whichprovided by guidance counselor at the schools, well - known figures in this field in Turkey and in the world, the overseas positionof the programme of the textile ready - made clothing. Moreover, the status of the students’ parents as alive/dead, apart/togetherand their jobs and income levels can be counted among these factors. Also the demand for the programme of the textile ready -made clothing in the Anatolian Professional High Schools, Anatolian Maiden Professional High Schools and Maiden ProfessionalHigh Schools in Konya, Karaman and Aksaray corresponds to an extend of % 17. 5 of the students who have made their choicesfor the fields.
