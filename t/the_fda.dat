5|$|As {{a result}} of her {{blocking}} American approval of thalidomide, Kelsey was nominated for the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service by John F. Kennedy, becoming the second woman so honoured. After receiving the award, Kelsey continued her work at <b>the</b> <b>FDA.</b> There she {{played a key role in}} shaping and enforcing the 1962 amendments. She also became responsible for directing the surveillance of drug testing at <b>the</b> <b>FDA.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1996, <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> {{approved}} a sustained-release formulation of bupropion called Wellbutrin SR, {{intended to be}} taken twice a day (as compared with {{three times a day}} for immediate-release Wellbutrin). In 2003, <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> {{approved a}}nother sustained-release formulation called Wellbutrin XL, intended for once-daily dosing. Wellbutrin SR and XL are available in generic form in the United States and Canada. In Canada, generic XR bupropion is distributed by Mylan. In 1997, bupropion was approved by <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> for use as a smoking cessation aid under the name Zyban. In 2006, Wellbutrin XL was similarly approved as a treatment for seasonal affective disorder.|$|E

5|$|Suicidal {{thoughts}} and behaviors are rare in clinical trials, and <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> requires all antidepressants, including bupropion, {{to carry a}} boxed warning stating that antidepressants may {{increase the risk of}} suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on a statistical analysis conducted by <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> which found a 2-fold increase in suicidal thought and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase in the 18–24 age group. For this analysis <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants in order to obtain statistically significant results. Considered in isolation, bupropion was not statistically different from placebo.|$|E
5|$|The Faisalabad Development Authority (FDA) was validly {{established}} in October 1976 under The Punjab Development of Cities Act (1976) to regulate, supervise and implement development activities in its jurisdiction area. <b>The</b> <b>FDA</b> {{acts as a}} policy-making body {{for the development of}} the city and is in charge of arranging and supervising major developments within the city. It is responsible for the administration of building regulations, management of parks and gardens and subsoil water management. <b>The</b> <b>FDA</b> works with the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) to control and maintain the water supply, sewerage and drainage. <b>The</b> <b>FDA</b> works to improve conditions in the slums.|$|E
5|$|As time passes, Woodroof shows {{compassion}} towards gay, lesbian, and transgender {{members of}} the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority is provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in 1987 he files a lawsuit against <b>the</b> <b>FDA.</b> He seeks {{the legal right to}} take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes <b>the</b> <b>FDA,</b> but lacks the legal tools to do anything. As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.|$|E

5|$|In 2010 fingolimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate {{receptor}} modulator, {{became the}} first oral drug approved by <b>the</b> <b>FDA,</b> being followed in 2012 by teriflunomide, a drug that inhibits the synthesis of pyrimidine and disrupts the interaction of T cells with antigen presenting cell. Fingolimod and teriflunomide are taken through a daily single dose. In 2013 one further oral drug, dimethyl fumarate -or BG12- (which is an improved version of fumaric acid, an already existing drug), was approved by <b>the</b> <b>FDA.</b> Dimethyl fumarate is taken twice daily.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{states that}} zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose, causing anosmia. Reports of anosmia were also {{observed}} in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent polio infections. On June 16, 2009, <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> ordered removal of zinc-based intranasal cold products from store shelves. <b>The</b> <b>FDA</b> said the loss of smell can be life-threatening because people with impaired smell cannot detect leaking gas or smoke, and cannot tell if food has spoiled before they eat it.|$|E
5|$|After Morton Mintz {{broke the}} story in July 1962, there was a {{substantial}} public outcry. The Kefauver Harris Amendment was passed unanimously by Congress in October 1962 to strengthen drug regulation. Companies were required to demonstrate the efficacy of new drugs, report adverse reactions to <b>the</b> <b>FDA,</b> and request consent from patients participating in clinical studies.|$|E
5|$|Aloe vera gel is used commercially as an {{ingredient}} in yogurts, beverages, and some desserts, although at certain doses, its toxic properties could be severe whether ingested or topically applied.

5|$|Another oral drug, cladribine, was {{approved}} in Russia and Australia in 2010.

50|$|The Independent Institute {{has criticized}} the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, {{for what it}} sees as {{over-regulation}} as a result political and bureaucratic incentives. Independent’s website FDAReview.org cites numerous scholarly studies by academic economists that question the agency’s safety, effectiveness, and incentives. Senior Fellow Robert Higgs has argued that <b>the</b> <b>FDA’s</b> regulation of healthcare products is “hazardous to our health”. Senior Fellow Alexander Tabarrok has questioned the need for <b>the</b> <b>FDA’s</b> pre-approval requirements for pharmaceuticals {{on the grounds that}} doctors successfully prescribe many drugs for off-label usage. He has recommended that <b>the</b> <b>FDA’s</b> focus be changed to one of testing drugs already on the market and making comparisons so that consumers and doctors can make better-informed choices, similar to what Consumer Reports does for consumer products.|$|R

5|$|Kelsey {{continued}} to work for <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> while being recognised for her earlier work. She was still working at the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research in 1995 and was appointed deputy for scientific and medical affairs.

5|$|Over {{the years}} <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> interviewed physicians, Reich's {{students}} and his patients, {{asking about the}} orgone accumulators. A professor at the University of Oregon who bought an accumulator told an FDA inspector that he knew the device was phoney, but found it helpful because his wife sat quietly in it for four hours every day.|$|E
5|$|Suicidal {{behavior}} {{is less of}} a concern when bupropion is prescribed for smoking cessation. According to a 2014 Cochrane review, while there is an association with suicide it is unclear if bupropion was the cause.
