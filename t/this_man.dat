A 25-year-old man at the party who had forged identity documents convinced her to sell sex for money and give him half of her earnings. Falle found <b>this</b> <b>man</b> well-dressed and attractive and did not think that he fit the stereotypical image of a pimp. She had nowhere to sleep that night and had no money for food, so she accepted his offer. The man to whom she sold sex that night had teeth that were rotten. They had sex on a soiled mattress in a poorly-ventilated restaurant attic, and she received $100.|$|E
5|$|Black also learns of {{the murder}} in Maryland, and connects it to the killings of four {{other women in the}} locale. Ignoring the protestations of his wife, Black leaves to {{investigate}} the parkland where one of the earlier bodies was uncovered. A park ranger discusses that case with him, telling Black that the body was found by an unidentified rambler. Black believes <b>this</b> <b>man</b> was the murderer. Elsewhere, Dion returns home, where he is belittled and emasculated by his overbearing mother, Marie (Linda Sorensen).|$|E
5|$|British Army Captain Walker goes missing {{during an}} {{expedition}} and is believed dead ("Overture"). His widow, Mrs. Walker, {{gives birth to}} their son, Tommy ("It's a Boy"). Years later, Captain Walker returns home and discovers that his wife has found a new lover. The Captain murders <b>this</b> <b>man</b> in an altercation as Tommy watches. Tommy's mother convinces him {{that he did not}} see or hear the incident and must never tell anyone about it; as a result, he becomes deaf, dumb, and blind to the outside world ("1921"). Tommy now relies on his sense of touch and imagination, developing a fascinating inner psyche ("Amazing Journey/Sparks").|$|E

5|$|Echmarcach mac Ragnaill (died 1064/1065) was a {{dominant}} {{figure in the}} eleventh-century Irish Sea region. At his height, he reigned as king over Dublin, the Isles, and perhaps the Rhinns of Galloway. The precise identity of Echmarcach's father, Ragnall, is uncertain. One possibility is that <b>this</b> <b>man</b> {{was one of two}} eleventh-century rulers of Waterford. Another possibility is that Echmarcach's father was an early eleventh-century ruler of the Isles. If any of these identifications are correct, Echmarcach may have {{been a member of the}} Uí Ímair kindred.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} that <b>this</b> <b>man</b> is the actual, corporeal Prismo, and the version Finn and Jake {{are familiar with}} is merely a dream. Prismo explains that killing a wishmaster—as in, waking up the man—is a cosmic crime, but that he will return when his corporal body falls back asleep. At that instant, the Lich springs into action, physically waking and destroying Prismo, killing him. Suddenly, an interdimensional being arrives and begins taking the Lich to the Citadel, to which Finn and Jake give chase.|$|E

Soon after, Kancha sends a man to assassinate Gaitonde. <b>This</b> <b>man</b> identifies Vijay to be {{the son of the}} teacher killed by Kancha and reports this to Kancha. However, while he tries to assassinate Gaitonde, he is killed by Vijay. Vijay, meanwhile marries his love interest Kaali Gawde (Priyanka Chopra), who is killed right after during a shooting spree by Kancha's men.|$|E

5|$|Norman's {{position}} as the Goblin King was quickly usurped by the Goblin Knight (Phil Urich). However, a mysterious man with a bandaged face is soon shown to be selling Goblin-based weaponry globally to attack Parker Industries. <b>This</b> <b>man</b> reveals himself to be Norman Osborn, alive again post-Secret Wars and still planning on getting revenge on Spider-Man. He is revealed to have {{played a part in}} the recent coup of Symkaria. He restores a semblance of his original features via a twisted form of plastic surgery but also resembles the Green Goblin's facets, and intends to release {{a modified version of the}} Goblin formula to turn the whole country into Goblin-powered soldiers programmed to be loyal to him.|$|E
5|$|The buttons worn on the Infantryman's {{clothing}} {{is not as}} minor a detail as it would sound. The average infantryman may have had his uniform made for him in Richmond, Virginia, however, the man enlisted in Georgia, and is now marching through the former state. In reflection to his loyalties to home, <b>this</b> <b>man,</b> for example, could have adorned his uniform with Georgia State buttons. This would indicate to his fellow soldiers his allegiance to both his state and his military unit. This was common practice during the war for {{both sides in the}} conflict.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} argued {{before the court}} on March 28, 2006. Katyal argued on behalf of Hamdan, and Paul Clement, the Solicitor General of the United States, argued {{on behalf of the}} government. Chief Justice Roberts recused himself because he had {{previously}} ruled on this case as part of the three judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Critics called for Justice Antonin Scalia to recuse himself, since he had made allegedly improper comments about the decision of the case prior to hearing oral arguments ("I'm not about to give <b>this</b> <b>man</b> who was captured in a war a full jury trial. I mean it's crazy") but he chose not to do so.|$|E

5|$|What Arafat {{says about}} me doesn't bother me. Not only he, {{but also a}} whole list of Arab and world {{politicians}} claim that I am an agent of the Zionists or the CIA. Others state that I am a mercenary of the French secret service and of the Soviet KGB. The latest rumor is that I am an agent of Khomeini. During a certain period they said we were spies for the Iraqi regime. Now they say that we are Syrian agents.... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate <b>this</b> <b>man</b> Abu Nidal. They wanted to find a weak point in his character. The result was zero.|$|E
5|$|Henry Gerber and the Society for Human Rights {{serve as}} direct {{links between the}} LGBT-related {{activism}} of the Weimar Republic and the American homophile movement of the 1950s. In 1929, {{a young man named}} Harry Hay was living in Los Angeles. He soon discovered the cruising scene in Pershing Square, where he met Champ Simmons, {{a man who had been}} a lover of one of Gerber's Society compatriots. <b>This</b> <b>man</b> told Hay about the Society's brief history, warning Hay of the futility of trying to organize gay men. Although Hay would later deny that he had any knowledge of previous LGBT activism, he was inspired by this knowledge to conceive in 1948 a proposal for a gay men's political and social group. In 1950 Hay's idea reached fruition when he and several other men founded the Mattachine Society, the first enduring LGBT rights organization in the United States.|$|E

5|$|In 1815, Emperor Gia Long summoned {{him back}} in order to {{suppress}} widespread rebellions in central Vietnam. In 1819, Duyệt was in Nghệ An and Thanh Hóa in northern Vietnam putting down revolts for Gia Long. During this time, he joined forces with a former rebel leader from a highlands minority group in Cao Bằng. <b>This</b> <b>man</b> became Duyệt's adopted son under the name Lê Văn Khôi and his men also rallied to the court. Khoi was then propelled directly into a high-ranking post in Gia Định. During the final four years of Gia Long's reign, Duyệt ascended to the highest rank in the court, and he and Pham Dang Hung, another southerner, {{were the only people}} present as the emperor died. Gia Long decreed that Duyệt take command of five royal regiments.|$|E
5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon <b>this</b> <b>man</b> has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing it like a gentleman. In many ways a most unusual trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one rises—he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench {{to come down and}} perch on the step of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners' seats... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes some human understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E
5|$|The {{way this}} man's dark hair grows, with the sharp {{dip in the}} middle of his high forehead, as though concentrating there all the energy of the {{masculine}} M, makes his face different from all the others. His coal-black eyes are rigidly focused in a gaze that expresses compelling force. The nose is unusually long and boldly curved. The mouth is wide and sensual, but the lips are firmly shut in a straight line, the corners strongly marked and tightened into final points, and this strengthens the impression — already suggested by the eyes — of a strong controlling will. It is an extraordinarily fascinating face, reminding us of faces of famous men, especially of Machiavelli's; and indeed the whole aspect of the head suggests something Mediterranean, as though <b>this</b> <b>man</b> had acquired his frank, searching, superior air at Italian academies.|$|E
