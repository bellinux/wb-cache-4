[...] (the list includes <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>years)</b> and followed by [...] "The United States government may have been able to outspend the Soviet Union into economic collapse in the Cold War arms race, injuring the entire planet in the process.

500|$|US {{military}} aid and {{arms sales to}} Indonesia increased from 1974 and continued through to <b>the</b> Bush and <b>Clinton</b> <b>years</b> until it was stopped in 1999. US arms provisions to Indonesia between 1975 and 1995 amounted to approximately $1.1 billion. <b>The</b> <b>Clinton</b> administration, under <b>the</b> Pentagon's JCET program, trained the Indonesian Kopassus special forces in urban guerrilla warfare, surveillance, counter-intelligence, sniper tactics and 'psychological operations'.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> CIA {{informed}} <b>Clinton</b> {{that they}} feared the thwarted attacks were {{just part of}} a larger series of attacks planned for <b>the</b> new <b>year.</b> <b>Clinton</b> asked Clarke and the CSG to draft plans to [...] "deter and disrupt" [...] al Qaeda attacks.|$|R
2500|$|While {{the mantle}} of fiscal {{conservatism}} is most commonly claimed by Republicans and libertarians, it is also claimed in some ways by many centrist or moderate Democrats who often refer to themselves as [...] "New Democrats". Though not supportive of the wide range tax cut policies that were often enacted during the Reagan and Bush administrations, the New Democrat coalition's primary economic agenda differed from the traditional tax and spend philosophy held among liberal Democrats and sided with the fiscal conservative belief that certain things needed to be cut in order to balance the federal budget. [...] Former President Bill Clinton, who was a New Democrat {{and part of the}} somewhat fiscally conservative Third Way advocating Democratic Leadership Council, {{is a prime example of}} this as his administration along with the Democratic-majority congress of 1993 passed on a party-line vote the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 which cut government spending, created a 36% individual income tax bracket, raised the top tax bracket, which encompassed the top 1.2% earning taxpayers, from 31% to 39.6%, and created a 35% income tax rate for corporations. The 1993 Budget Act also cut taxes for fifteen million low-income families and 90% of small businesses. Additionally, during <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>years,</b> the PAYGO (pay-as-you-go) system originally introduced with the passing of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (which required that all increases in direct spending or revenue decreases be offset by other spending decreases or revenue increases and was very popular with deficit hawks) had gone into effect, and was used regularly until the system's expiration in 2002.|$|E

2500|$|Jane Heard Clinton died in Tulsa in 1945. In <b>the</b> {{following}} <b>year,</b> <b>Clinton</b> married again, {{this time}} to Beulah Jane Elliott.

Memorial services were conducted at the Boston Avenue Methodist Church.|$|R
50|$|Roselli's {{career as}} a correspondent, {{photographer}} and editorialist at Il Giorno spanned over three decades from 1956 to 1989. Responsible for the coverage of {{every aspect of the}} United States, from politics to culture, science, technology and life-style, he was a defining voice in Italy for such major events as the Cape Canaveral launchings, the Kennedy and King assassinations, Watergate, the Iranian hostage crisis, and <b>the</b> Reagan and <b>Clinton</b> <b>years.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There was {{an uproar}} during <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>years</b> when Genn {{depicted}} Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and Al Gore on a National Review cover titled [...] "The Manchurian Candidates." [...] Genn's covers depicting Sonia Sotomayor as a Buddha and President Barack Obama as a proctologist produced similar responses.|$|E
50|$|In the 2006 midterm election, however, {{due to the}} unpopularity of the Iraq War, {{the heated}} debate {{concerning}} illegal Hispanic immigration, and Republican-related Congressional scandals, Hispanics and Latinos went as strongly Democratic as they have since <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>years.</b> Exit polls showed the group voting for Democrats by a lopsided 69-30 margin, with Florida Latinos {{for the first time}} split evenly.|$|E
5000|$|Their {{releases}} Solutions to Our Nations Problems, Take 1, (1999) and Take 2 (2001) featured {{selections from}} their regular appearances on National Public Radio's Sunday Weekend Edition, {{where they were}} billed as [...] "resident political satirists" [...] during <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>years.</b> On the show they provided a series of short political satire sketches on the political issues of the day.|$|E
5000|$|Judgement on the Broaddrick matter has varied among book-length {{treatments}} of <b>the</b> Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>years.</b> Joe Conason and Gene Lyons' book The Hunting of the President argued that Broaddrick's claim is not credible, {{noting that the}} FBI had found evidence for the allegations [...] "inconclusive". [...] Michael Isikoff's book, Uncovering Clinton, stated that Clinton's lawyers figured that he might well have had consensual, extramarital sex with Broaddrick, {{but they did not}} believe he would have forced himself on her. [...] Christopher Hitchens' book, No One Left to Lie To, argued that Broaddrick's claim is credible and shows similarities to Paula Jones' later allegation of sexual harassment.|$|R
2500|$|For {{the third}} quarter of 2007, which {{typically}} sees lower numbers than the rest of <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> <b>Clinton</b> led all candidates with $27 million raised and with 100,000 new contributors. [...] This beat Obama's $20 million and allowed Clinton to apportion some of the amount for an expected general election race rather than the primary season.|$|R

50|$|Lott also {{emphasizes}} {{his years}} as Majority Whip in the House and {{his years as}} Majority Leader in the Senate, where Lott claims to have built an efficient vote-getting organization and {{played a key role}} in several legislative accomplishments, including the Reagan-era budget cuts and tax cuts, and welfare reform and the tobacco settlement during <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>years.</b> This emphasis may tie into Lott's ambition to rejoin the Senate Republican Leadership.|$|E
5000|$|Lowry {{has written}} two non-fiction books. His New York Times best-selling book, Legacy: Paying the Price for <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>Years</b> is a polemic about President Bill Clinton, whom he deprecates as [...] "Navel-Gazer-in-Chief". In June 2013, he {{published}} the political biography Lincoln Unbound. Lowry {{has also written}} fiction. In 2009, Lowry and Keith Korman wrote Banquo's Ghosts, a political thriller.

50|$|President Clinton had in 1993 {{tied the}} {{annual review of}} Most Favored Nation trading status to China’s record on human rights, a {{decision}} that was in keeping with popular opinion on China. When this status came up for renewal <b>the</b> next <b>year,</b> <b>Clinton</b> reversed this position and granted China MFN without requiring any changes regarding human rights.|$|R
50|$|Corn {{moved on}} to fiction with a {{contribution}} to Unusual Suspects (1996), a paperback collection of crime stories published as a fundraiser to combat world hunger. His first novel, Deep Background, was a conspiracy thriller about the assassination of a president at a White House press conference and the ensuing investigation. Reviews praised Corn's mastery of the political atmosphere and characters, although they split on whether this was a virtue or, coming {{at the conclusion of}} <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>years,</b> already all-too-familiar territory.|$|E

5000|$|During {{her time}} in <b>the</b> Senate, <b>Clinton</b> was a {{co-sponsor}} of the Armenian Genocide Resolution, and as senator twice wrote to President Bush calling on him {{to refer to the}} Armenian Genocide in his annual commemorative statement. (The use of the word [...] "genocide" [...] is contested by the government of Turkey.) In 2008 (<b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>Clinton</b> unsuccessfully sought <b>the</b> Democratic nomination for president), Clinton stated that [...] "I believe the horrible events perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire against Armenians constitute a clear case of genocide." ...|$|R
5000|$|The US {{supplied}} {{weapons to}} Indonesia during the invasion {{and the subsequent}} occupation. A week after the invasion of East Timor, the National Security Council prepared a detailed analysis which found {{that the vast majority}} of the military equipment was US supplied. While the US government said they had suspended military assistance from December 1975 to June 1976, military aid was actually above what the US Department of State proposed and the US Congress continued to increase it, nearly doubling it. Between 1975 and 1980, when the violence in East Timor was at its climax, the United States furnished approximately $340 million in weaponry to the Indonesian government.US military aid and arms sales to Indonesia increased from 1974 and continued through to <b>the</b> Bush and <b>Clinton</b> <b>years</b> until it was stopped in 1999.

2500|$|The bill stalled {{and died}} in Congress in 1994, and <b>the</b> next <b>year,</b> <b>Clinton</b> was reduced to asking Congress {{for a series of}} small, {{incremental}} reforms to healthcare.

5000|$|Nelson {{first became}} nationally {{known for being}} {{one of the founders of}} Lead or Leave a {{political}} action group that focused on reducing the deficit and fighting for generational equity. Lead or Leave garnered national attention with an accountability pledge that asked the President and all members of Congress to pledge to cut the federal deficit in half in four years or leave office. Led by Nelson and Jonathan Cowan, the [...] "mini-movement" [...] became so prominent it was featured on 60 Minutes, Nightline, Good Morning America and The Today Show, creating a stir in [...] "MTV-DC" [...] during <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} virtues of strong presidential {{leadership}} in the regulatory process, {{we need to have}} a richer sense of the dimensions of presidential leadership in regulatory decisionmaking. The set of proposals put forward by the National Performance Review (NPR), a task force established by <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> administration last <b>year,</b> provides a useful focal point for the examination of this issue. In Part I, the author considers how the trend toward President-led initiatives fits with our growing skepticism about the capacities of legislators and bureaucrats to improve regulation and administration. In Part II, the author traces some of the conceptual underpinnings of the President 2 ̆ 7 s expanding regulatory role. The author adds to this mostly theoretical discussion the particulars of the NPR Report in Part III. Ultimately, <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> administration 2 ̆ 7 s opening salvo into the thicket of regulatory reform is of a piece with contemporary trends in presidential politics and regulatory administration...|$|R
