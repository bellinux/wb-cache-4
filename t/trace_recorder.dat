Puthoff states that after about a five-second delay, Heberd says it was a ten- to fifteen-minute delay, the frequency of the <b>trace</b> <b>recorder</b> oscillation doubled for about 30 seconds (reportedly a common occurrence due to variations in the shared helium line to the lab). Heberd continues, when the curve burped, Swann asked, [...] "Is that what I am supposed to do?" [...] Swann said he responded,"is that an effect?" [...] Then according to Heberd, Swann crossed the room taking his attention away from the chart recorder. [...] Swann said he took his mind off the machine and was sketching. Others watched the recorder to see if the irregularity would be repeated, and it was. Puthoff asked Swann, [...] "Did you do that too?" [...] Swann said he again responded, [...] "Is that an effect?" [...] According to Puthoff, Swann said he was then tired and couldn’t “hold it any longer” and let go. The chart recorder pattern returned to normal.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{details of}} tests {{carried out to}} assess {{the correlation between the}} major mechanical properties of selected bituminous mixes using the Marshall, the unconfined compressive strength, and the triaxial compressive strength tests. The influence of the type of aggregate on the Marshall test parameters has been investigated using five combinations of aggregates with continuous and gap grading for tests at 60 °C and 45 °C. The role of filler has been examined by preparing limestone aggregate mixes {{with a wide range of}} filler contents for test by the normal Marshall procedure. Tests have also been carried out to investigate the effect of density on the unconfined compressive strength of continuously graded gravel aggregate mixes, the tests being carried out at 2 in/min rate of strain and at 60 °C. The effect of testing rate of strain and of testing temperature was noted for the three types of aggregate. The Marshall stability test and the unconfined compressive strength test results were obtained using a <b>trace</b> <b>recorder</b> and the continuous results of lead/deformation thus obtained have been analysed in detail. Values of cohesion and angle of internal friction have been determined for two types of aggregate using an "open-system" triaxial compressive strength test at different values of lateral pressure. The tests in this part of the study were limited in number of lateral pressure undertaken at 45 °C and 2 in/min rate of strain. The review of previous work covers mix design methods and observations on the three mechanical tests used in the investigations carried out. Reference is also made to some other aspects that affect the value of the tests. The experimental results obtained are discussed in detail and a number of conclusions are drawn regarding the significance of the tests carried out. In particular, the type of aggregate used is shown to have a dominant effect on the properties measured. Recommendations are given for further work with emphasis on the need to correlate laboratory results with practical pavement mixes...|$|E
40|$|Statistical {{estimates}} of the accuracy with which electronystagmography (ENG) can provide eye movement records have been published by Shackel (1960). His data described horizontal eye movements over a fairly large displacement, as did data from trials com-paring this technique with eye movement films described by Hoffman, Wellman, and Carmichael (I 939) and Michael and Melvill Jones (I 966). Elsewhere, Shackel and Davis (1960) demonstrated that monocular vertical potentials were only about 6 o per cent. {{of the magnitude of}} binocular horizontal potentials, which inferred that a vertical eye movement may yield a signal with a poorer signal-to-noise ratio than a comparable horizontal one. In the opinion of Miles (939), who presented no supporting data, this vertical potential may possibly be enlarged if the eyes are closed. Vertical fixation movements could still be particularly difficult to measure accurately, however, because of an eyelid artefact which can confuse the vertical eye movement record (Barry and MIelvill Jones, I 965). The aim of the present investigation was to perform a test-retest reliability examination of ENG records, when such records were made from small vertical eye movements. A comparison between the eye open- eye closed case was also included. Subjects 32 subjects participated, nine of them female. Most had normal binocular visual acuity, none poorer than 6 /I 2 corrected (as tested by the Snellen chart). None had any visible or known eye abnormality. Their ages ranged from 17 - 4 to 50. 3 years, but only eight were in fact over 30 years old. All were known to the experimenter and none was unduly anxious about the experimental situation, as far as could be seen. Equipment ENG signals were obtained from suction-cup electrodes (described by Shackel, 1958) and delivered to d. c. amplification equipment. This equipment was of high input impedance (differential input) and low drift, and had gains, available by switching, from x 1, 000 to x ilo,oo. The output was- 3 db down at 6 Hz, and- 44 db at 50 Hz. (A secondary output, flat to 6 o Hz, could be introduced as an occasional check that such steep filtering was not misleading.) The amplified signals were delivered to an ultra-violet <b>trace</b> <b>recorder...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—I/O {{has become}} one of the {{determining}} factors of HPC application performance. Understanding an application’s I/O activity requires a multi-level view of the I/O function flow that includes high-level I/O libraries. We have developed a <b>tracing</b> framework, called <b>Recorder,</b> that captures I/O function calls at multiple layers of the parallel I/O stack without requiring source code modifications. In this paper, we show how <b>Recorder’s</b> <b>trace</b> output can be used to investigate I/O activity and identify performance inefficiencies in two I/O benchmarks running on a leading edge HPC platform. Future work to organize and present the collected information more intuitively will further increase the value of Recorder’s capabilities. We believe that a multi-level I/O tracing framework can provide key insights to end users and I/O library developers working to improve I/O on HPC platforms. I...|$|R

40|$|An optical {{measuring}} device with electrical timing unit {{was designed to}} identify the aspiration of inadequate volumes of samples into AutoAnalyzers. The device meas-ures the duration of transit of solutions past a fixed point in the sample line. Con-siderable differences in transit times are found under normal operating conditions when standard Technicon components are used. The variation in transit times is greater between sampler modules than when the same module is used. Documentation of duration of sample aspiration in publications describing AutoAnalyzer methods would facilitate comparison of results between laboratories. A modification of the Technicon Model II sampler unit is described which markedly reduces the variation in sample aspiration. REDUCED SAMPLE VOLUMES are aspirated into the AutoAnalyzer, incorrect results may be produced; these results should be rejected. With normal operation of the AutoAnalyzer it is usually possible for a technologist to recognize when insufficient sample has been aspirated because the peak on the <b>recorder</b> <b>tracing</b> is narrower.

50|$|The unit is {{composed}} of a probe; a wire link; and a shipboard canister. Inside of the probe is a thermistor which is connected electronically to a chart recorder. The probe falls freely at 20 feet per second and that determines its depth and provides a temperature-depth <b>trace</b> on the <b>recorder.</b> A pair of fine copper wires which pay out from both a spool retained on the ship and one dropped with the instrument, provide a data transfer line to the ship for shipboard recording. Eventually, the wire runs out and breaks, and the XBT sinks to the ocean floor. Since the deployment of an XBT {{does not require the}} ship to slow down or otherwise interfere with normal operations, XBT's are often deployed from vessels of opportunity, such as cargo ships or ferries, rather than a dedicated research ship where a CTD would normally be used in preference. Airborne versions (AXBT) are also used; these use radio frequencies to transmit the data to the aircraft during deployment. Today Lockheed Martin Sippican has manufactured over 5 million XBTs.|$|R
40|$|The {{critical}} importance of wire rope integrity to the mining industry {{has led to}} the creation of standards for the retirement of wire rope as well as to the development of electromagnetic devices and procedures that would allow wire ropes to be tested against these standards without destroying them, The U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) conducted research to evaluate these devices by measuring loss of metallic cross-sectional area and the number of wire breaks, or local faults. The intent was to define the extent to which the technique can identify degradation within the rope, e. g., broken wires, corrosion, and wear. Experimental results showed that instrument sensitivity depended on a number of factors, including rope diameter, placement of sensors, location and characteristics of flaws, rope speed, and tension on the rope. The experiments also demonstrated the importance of having an elongated <b>recorder</b> <b>trace</b> and a properly trained and experienced operator to interpret overall results. A design of a rope and test procedures for use in laboratory evaluation of instruments have been recommended by the American Society for Testing and Materials Committee E 07. 07. 10, Wire Rope Applications.

40|$|In {{order to}} verify the {{duration}} magnitude MD we calculated local magnitude ML values of 288 earthquakes occurring from October 2002 to April 2003 at Mt. Etna. The analysis was computed at three digital stations of the permanent seismic network of Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia of Catania, using the relationship ML = logA+alog?-b, where A is maximum half-amplitude of the horizontal component of the seismic recording measured in mm and the term «+alog?-b» {{takes the place of}} the term «-logA 0 » of Richter relationship. In particular, a = 0. 15 for ?< 200 km, b= 0. 16 for ?< 200 km. Duration magnitude MD values, moment magnitude MW values and other local magnitude values were compared. Differences between ML and MD were obtained for the strong seismic swarms occurring on October 27, during the onset of 2002 - 2003 Mt. Etna eruption, characterized by a high earthquake rate, with very strong events (seismogram results clipped in amplitude on drum <b>recorder</b> <b>trace)</b> and high level of volcanic tremor, which not permit us to estimate the duration of the earthquakes correctly. ML and MD relationships were related and therefore a new relationship for MD is proposed. Cumulative strain release calculated after the eruption using ML values is about 1. 75 E+ 06 J 1 / 2 higher than the one calculated using MD values...|$|R
40|$|Low {{concentrations}} of KCNO (approx o. 1. mM) {{were found to}} react rapidly with activated papain (EC 3. 4. 4. 10), leading to inactivation of the enzyme. The reaction proved to be reversible, the activity slowly returning again on sufficient dilution of the enzyme-KCNO mixture. The reaction occurred with the essential thiol group of papain, shown by an emperometric method. The rate of inactivation could be conveniently determined from {{the shape of the}} progress curves of ester hydrolysis (5 – 120 mM benzoylarginine ethyl ester), <b>traced</b> on the <b>recorder</b> of a pH stat. The rate constant k was found to vary with substrate concentration. It decreased with increasing sustrate concentration. A plot was made of k versus [E]/([E] + [ES]) as calculated from the known value of Km. A linear relationship was found, which gave extrapolated values for k = 9400 M- 1 · min- 1, at zero substrate concentration and of k = 1500 M- 1 · min- 1 at infinite substrate concentration. The latter value shows that protection of the enzyme in the ES complex is not complete. The rate constant of the reaction of the thiol group of free cysteine with KCNO under the same conditions (pH 6. 0; 25 °) was only 3. 4 M- 1 · min- 1. Hence the reactivity of cyanate towards the thiol group of papain, as determined by extrapolation to zero substrate concentration, is 3000 times greater than the reactivity of the thiol group of free cysteine...|$|R
40|$|Evolution of {{hydrogen}} and oxygen from electrodes in an electrolysis cell may be conveniently monitored in a non-intrusive manner via its ultrasonic acoustic emission. The apparatus used in this work was comprised of a nickel anode, a stainless steel cathode, and a saturated calomel reference electrode, all situated in a three chamber cell containing sodium hydroxide solution. The potential necessary for gas bubble evolution was conclusively detected by onset of bursts of acoustic emission. Individual acoustic emission signals, captured using a broadband transducer mounted on the working electrode, contained frequencies from the audible range to as high as 800 kHz. These were correlated {{with the release of}} bursts of bubbles from the electrode’s surface, both visually and via a chart <b>recorder</b> <b>trace</b> of peak acoustic power vs. time. Trends in several time-domain signal descriptors were observed with increase in the applied voltage. Acoustic power spectra were obtained by averaging spectra from many acoustic signals. Semiquantitative estimates of rate of emission were made by integration of the peak acoustic level. The effects of applied potential and electrolyte concentration on the multiple bursts of acoustic emission were characterized and are presented as a system response surface. Increasing the applied potential resulted in greater rates of bubble emission, which increased the intensity of acoustic emission, but produced an identical acoustic power spectrum. The extent of acoustic emission at high concentrations and applied potentials was less than expected, which suggested decreased efficiency under these conditions. Electrolysis start-up kinetics were also studied using a digitizer capable of large record lengths...|$|R
40|$|Six healthy {{subjects}} rapidly {{lifted and}} lowered a small (250 g) weight {{with the first}} dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) of one hand while the work performed was recorded continuously until fatigue (defined as losing the ability to continue lifting). Work was recorded in units of chart <b>recorder</b> <b>trace</b> displacement from baseline (centimeters) as an isotonic transducer followed {{the movement of the}} weight. In all experiments, the temperature of the hand was first adjusted by immersion in a controlled-temperature water bath. In the warmest condition, the skin surface temperature over the FDI was 30. 5 (0. 30) degrees C [mean (SE) ]. After moderate cooling, this surface temperature was 21. 5 (0. 16) degrees C. Cooling significantly reduced the time taken to reach fatigue and more than halved the work capacity. An intermediate degree of cooling was also used in four subjects, showing that most of the effects seen were changing incrementally. Before work, and at fatigue, intracellular metabolic conditions in the FDI were studied by phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (31 P-NMR) spectroscopy, with occlusion of the blood flow maintained during measurements. The mean intracellular pH of the FDI was also calculated. The changes observed were all consistent with the fact that intense work requires energy which must be derived largely from intracellular stores of phosphocreatine and glycogen. Less work made less demand upon reserves, and created lower concentrations of waste products and by-products. The observations did not, however, allow us to explain why fatigue occurred at a particular point or why work capacity was reduced by cooling...|$|R
