At {{one point}} during the debate, Marshall officials were so certain of its selection that <b>they</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> governor's mansion. After extensive debate, State Senator Joseph H. Kilbourne of Ingham County proposed that the nearly uninhabited Lansing Township be made the seat of government.

The legislature renamed it as the Town of Michigan, though by 1848 the original name of Lansing was restored.|$|E
5|$|Crewe was {{the seat}} of the de Crewe (or de Criwa) family in the 12th and 13th centuries; <b>they</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> timber-framed manor house there in around 1170.

Legal problems resulted in the lands being acquired by Sir Christopher Hatton, from whose heirs Sir Randolph Crewe (1559–1646) purchased an extensive estate including the manors of Crewe, Barthomley and Haslington in 1608 for over £6,000 (£ today).|$|E

To overcome the Midland's lead, <b>they</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> narrow-gauge line on the north side of the Roaring Fork, today the route of the Rio Grande Trail. Both the gauge and the elimination of the Maroon Creek crossing, which was causing complications for the Midland, saved considerable time, and the Rio Grande managed to bring the first train to Aspen in October 1887. Working through the winter, the Midland finished the Maroon Creek Bridge and got its standard gauge line into Aspen five months later.|$|E
