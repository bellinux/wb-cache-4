5|$|Airline EasyJet is {{interested}} in the inspection of aircraft with drones. It made a first inspection in 2015. Equipped with laser sensors and high resolution camera, the drone performs autonomous flight around the aeroplane. It generates a three-dimensional image of the aircraft and transmits it to a technician. <b>The</b> <b>operator</b> can then navigate in this representation and zoom to display a high-resolution picture of some parts of the aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>operator</b> must then visually diagnose {{the presence or absence of}} defects. This approach avoids the use of platforms to observe the upper parts of the aeroplane.|$|E
5|$|For example, suppose <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> {{chose the}} message setting KYG for a message. <b>The</b> <b>operator</b> would first set the Enigma's rotors {{to the ground}} setting, which might be GBL on that {{particular}} day, and then encrypt the message setting on the Enigma twice; that is, <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> would enter KYGKYG (which might come out to something like QZKBLX). <b>The</b> <b>operator</b> would then reposition the rotors at KYG, and encrypt the actual message. A receiving operator could reverse the process to recover first the message setting, then the message itself. The repetition of the message setting was apparently meant as an error check to detect garbles, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher. Due to the indicator's repetition of the message setting, Rejewski knew that, in the plaintext of the indicator, the first and fourth letters were the same, the second and fifth were the same, and the third and sixth were the same. These relations could be exploited {{to break into the}} cipher.|$|E

40|$|Model {{management}} is {{an approach to}} simplify the programming of metadata-intensive applications. It offers developers powerful operators, such as Compose, Extract, and Merge, that are applied to models, such as database schemas or interface specifications, and to mappings between models. To be used in practice, these operators need to be implemented for particular schema definition languages and mapping languages. To guide that implementation, we need a language-independent semantics that tells what <b>the</b> <b>operators</b> should do. In this paper we develop a state-based semantics of <b>the</b> <b>operators.</b> That is, we express the effect of applying <b>the</b> <b>operators</b> to models {{in terms of what}} <b>the</b> <b>operators</b> do to instances of these models. We show that our semantics captures previously-proposed desiderata for <b>the</b> <b>operators.</b> We study formal properties of <b>the</b> <b>operators,</b> such as com-mutativity, associativity, uniqueness of results, and how the cardinality of the results corresponds to that of the inputs. Finally, we specify the state-based semantics of <b>the</b> <b>operators</b> in Rondo, <b>the</b> first prototype model-management system. ...|$|R
