25|$|The {{blue jay}} {{occupies}} {{a variety of}} habitats within its large range, from the pine woods of Florida to the spruce-fir forests of northern Ontario. It is less abundant in denser forests, preferring mixed woodlands with oaks and beeches. It has expertly adapted to human activity, occurring in parks and residential areas, and can adapt to wholesale deforestation with relative ease if human activity creates other means for the jays <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>by.</b>|$|E
25|$|The show is {{centered}} on the Conners, an American working-class family struggling <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>by</b> on a limited household income in the fictional town of Lanford, Illinois. Lanford was nominally located in Fulton County, but other on-air references over the years suggest the town is {{in the vicinity of}} Aurora, Elgin, and DeKalb, which are much closer to Chicago. The family consisted of outspoken Roseanne, married to husband Dan, and their three children: Becky, Darlene, and DJ. Later in the series, Roseanne becomes pregnant again and gives birth to a boy named Jerry Garcia Conner.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} that the Army of the Holy War and the Palestinian forces were in was worse. They could {{not rely on}} any form of foreign support and had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>by</b> on the funds that Mohammad Amin al-Husayni could raise. The troops' armament was limited to what the fighters already had. To make things even worse, {{they had to be}} content with arms bought on the black market or pillaged from British warehouses, and, as a result, did not really have enough arms to wage war.|$|E

25|$|Employees {{were given}} 14 minutes between each shift to punch the time clock, walk to their {{respective}} workbench and prepare for work. It took a minimum of eight minutes for all the employees <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>by</b> the time clock. The estimated walking time for employees ranged from 30 seconds to three minutes, but some workers needed {{as many as eight}} minutes to reach their workbenches. Upon arriving at their workbench, employees were required to put on aprons or overalls, removed shirts, tape or grease arms, put on finger cots, prepare equipment, turn on switches, open windows, and/or assemble or sharpen tools. Such preparatory activities consumed three to four minutes.|$|E
25|$|Donnelly has {{supported}} {{increases in the}} minimum wage and protection of collective bargaining. In Donnelly's first term he co-sponsored H.R. 2: The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. The act allows Congress to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to raise the federal minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25, and cuts taxes on small businesses by $12 Billion. After The Fair Minimum Wage Act was signed, Donnelly said in a statement that, “A decent wage is essential for a working family <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>by</b> in America. This is not only good social and economic policy, it's just plain fair.” Donnelly voted in favor of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.|$|E
25|$|With time, the {{shortage}} economy led to scarcity of meat, coffee, tea and other ingredients of daily use. Many products like chocolate, sugar and meat were rationed, {{with a specific}} limit depending on social class and health requirements. Physical workers and pregnant women were generally entitled to more food products. Imports were restricted, {{so much of the}} food supply was domestic. Cuisine became homogeneous, to be a chef was no longer a prestigious profession and for decades the country became basically disconnected from any foreign cuisine. Tropical fruits (citrus, banana, pineapple, etc.) were available during holidays and local fruits and vegetables were mostly seasonal but were available at private stands. For most of the year the Poles had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>by</b> with only domestic winter fruit and vegetables: apples, plums, currants, onions, potatoes, cabbage, root vegetables and frozen products. Other food products (of foreign origins) were available at markets at high prices.|$|E

25|$|In 1867, Griffith Dickenson Compton led a {{group of}} 30 pioneers to the area. These {{families}} had traveled by wagon train south from Stockton, California in search of ways {{to earn a living}} other than in the rapid exhaustion of gold fields. Originally named Gibsonville, after one of the tract owners, it was later called Comptonville. However, to avoid confusion with the Comptonville located in Yuba County, the name was shortened to Compton. Compton's earliest settlers were faced with terrible hardships as they farmed the land in bleak weather <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>by</b> with just the barest subsistence. The weather continued to be harsh, rainy and cold, and fuel was difficult to find. To gather firewood it was necessary to travel to mountains close to Pasadena. The round trip took almost a week. Many in the Compton party wanted to relocate to a friendlier climate and settle down, but as there were two general stores within traveling distance—one in the pueblo of Los Angeles, the other in Wilmington—they eventually decided to stay put.|$|E

[...] He awarded both entries a [...] "B+" [...] but noted, however, that [...] "Without" [...] nearly came across as [...] "strained or stalling", but [...] "manages <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>by</b> with the general freakiness of the alien bounty hunter".

[...] He received his Juris Doctor in 1968, graduating 76th of 85 in his class. [...] Biden was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969.|$|E
500|$|The Softwire is {{actually}} a story that Haarsma began imagining in his childhood. As a teenager, he worked at his parents' ceramic factory during the summers, hauling fifty pound molds around in the extreme heat of a kiln room. To Haarsma, it felt similar to what the children of his books might feel as slaves. In addition to these experiences, {{there is a more}} prominent influence on the premise of The Softwire—that is, there is a mystery of a journey to a new, unknown place to start a new life. Growing up, Haarsma dreamed of moving to the United States; and in his twenties, he actually did. While there, living in New York, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles, Haarsma [...] witnessed immigrants struggling <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>by.</b> He tried to imagine what caused them to risk everything, and to move to another country, and to have a chance at something better. It is this journey (and struggle) that is prevalent in The Softwire.|$|E

Pebe, a single mother, {{struggled}} financially while supporting herself, Kesha, and Kesha's older brother Lagan; they relied on welfare payments and food stamps <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>by.</b> When Kesha was an infant, Pebe would often have to look after her onstage while performing. Kesha says she has no knowledge of her father's identity, though she has jokingly speculated {{that he may be}} Mick Jagger. However, a man named Bob Chamberlain who called himself her father approached Star magazine in 2011 with pictures and letters, claiming them as proof that they had been in regular contact as father and daughter before she turned 19. Her mother is of German and Hungarian (from Szentes) descent. One of Kesha's great-grandfathers was Polish.|$|E

In fact, he argued that it largely [...] "makes up for any shortcomings in the script". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five and called it [...] "one of the best standalone X-Files in years." ...|$|E
