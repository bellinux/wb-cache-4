[...] I know often with good reason there has been an opportunity in higher education to adjust tuition to match what the place wanted to spend, and I just think we've reached the point where we ought to break that pattern." [...] The first tuition freeze required the university to find $40 million in savings or new revenue. In order to make up for the lost revenue from tuition freezes, Daniels and the Purdue Board of Trustees focused on finding operating efficiencies such as consolidating information technology data centers, investing cash reserves and switching to a consumer-driven health plan for employees.|$|E

[...] Helge Rønning, a professor at the Institute of Media and Communication at the University of Oslo, said the offense to Muslims was outweighed by freedom-of-speech concerns. [...] "Indignation from those who claim the right to engage in criticism of religion {{is as important as the}} indignation that comes from the Muslim side," [...] he told the [...] NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation). [...] "I think that this is an attitude that goes deeper than whether these drawings are blasphemous or not." [...] Vebjørn Selbekk, a Norwegian editor who was threatened in 2006 after he reprinted Danish cartoons of Mohammed in his publication, supported the May 20 protest. [...] "I think maybe <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> way to react—with humor, and also to spread this number, so it isn't only a few who sit with all the threats and all the discomfort associated with defending our freedom of speech in this area," [...] he said.
