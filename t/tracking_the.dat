Two and a half hours later, the agency issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), but almost immediately thereafter, shower and thunderstorm activity rapidly diminished due to decreased poleward outflow and increased wind shear.

5|$|Similar to {{previous}} storms Antoinette and Bellamine, Tropical Storm Chantelle originated from the ITCZ in the Australian region. On November23, the MFR began <b>tracking</b> <b>the</b> {{system as a}} tropical disturbance off {{the west coast of}} Sumatra. The system fluctuated in intensity while moving westward, entering the south-west Indian as a tropical depression on November24. Around that time, the JTWC had begun classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 7S. On November26, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Chantelle, and the convection continued to organize despite the presence of wind shear. That day, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 120km/h (75mph). On November27, the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 95km/h (60mph). An approaching trough imparted significant weakening, and Chantelle weakened to tropical depression status 18hours after it was at peak intensity. A ridge behind the trough steered the weakening system to the northwest, causing Chantelle to reach the low latitude of 5°S. Widespread cloudiness made it difficult for MFR to continue <b>tracking</b> <b>the</b> circulation, and the agency issued the final advisory on November30 northwest of Diego Garcia. The JTWC continued <b>tracking</b> <b>the</b> storm for several more days, and the remnants of Chantelle likely contributed to the formation of the subsequent Tropical Cyclone Daniella.|$|E

5|$|A {{disturbance}} in the Indian Ocean {{intertropical convergence zone}} became evident southeast of the Chagos Archipelago on March16 after two cyclones {{moved away from the}} region.

On March17, the JTWC also began <b>tracking</b> <b>the</b> system. Due to cool, dry air, the system initially did not intensify, although its passage over warmer sea surface temperatures on March19 allowed for strengthening. On March19, MF classified the disturbance as Tropical Storm Nadia after rainbands developed. A day later, the JTWC designated Nadia as Tropical Cyclone 23S.|$|E

The angle of the axis is normally horizontal, though some, such as the solar park at Nellis Airforce Base, which have a 20° tilt, incline the axis towards the equator in a north-south orientation – effectively a hybrid between tracking and fixed tilt.|$|E
5|$|After {{several days}} as a {{powerful}} typhoon, Fengshen began a weakening trend due to decreased outflow and dry air.

At 1145UTC on July25, Fengshen made landfall on Yakushima in Japan's Ōsumi Islands, while a severe tropical storm. The next day, the storm passed a short distance southwest of Jeju Island offshore South Korea. After entering the Yellow Sea, Fengshen weakened into a tropical depression, and on July27 the JTWC discontinued advisories, after much of the convection had dissipated. The JMA continued <b>tracking</b> <b>the</b> system, and Fengshen made landfall on China's Shandong Peninsula late on July27. The next day, the depression dissipated over the Bohai Sea.|$|E
