Ashley created the Bristol Channel Mission in order to serve seafarers on the 400 sailing vessels which used the Bristol Channel.

5|$|The Bulgarian Orthodox Church decisively {{opposed the}} charges against Joachim III and {{considered}} the emperor's actions personal vengeance. It included {{his name in the}} list of the Patriarchs, preserved in the Book of Boril, and mentioned him in the liturgies. The litanies in his honour indicate that Joachim III was remembered with respect in the Church. He was the second Bulgarian Patriarch executed by the ruling monarch after Vissarion, condemned by Ivan Asen II (r. 1218–1241) after refusing <b>to</b> <b>bless</b> his third marriage.|$|E

5|$|The church {{remained}} incomplete {{for over}} ninety years. By 1957 Anglican services {{were being held}} in St Stephens, a wooden church next to the apparent ruin. Around this time some in the church showed interest in completion of the old structure, {{partly due to the}} approaching centenary of construction beginning. In April of that year a gathering of people from the Parish of Carrick was held in the unfinished building, and a prayer held <b>to</b> <b>bless</b> its completion. The gathering, and associated committee, were led and chaired by W R Barrett, assistant bishop of Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|While chrism is {{used only}} for the three sacraments that cannot be repeated, a {{different}} oil is used by a priest or bishop <b>to</b> <b>bless</b> a Catholic who, because of illness or old age, {{has begun to be}} in danger of death. This sacrament, known as Anointing of the Sick, is believed to give comfort, peace, courage and, if the sick person is unable to make a confession, even forgiveness of sins.|$|E
5|$|Hansel {{wakes up}} with Mina, who reveals {{herself to be}} a white witch. She heals his wounds again and uses a grimoire <b>to</b> <b>bless</b> Hansel's arsenal of weapons. Hansel, Mina, and Ben head out to disrupt the Blood Moon Sabbath. Mina begins {{slaughtering}} dark witches with a Gatling gun, while Hansel squares off against Muriel's witches and frees the children. Edward defies Muriel's orders and releases Gretel before Muriel throws him off the cliff. Muriel flees on a broomstick, but Ben manages to shoot her and forces her to crash. Hansel goes after Muriel while Gretel stops to revive Edward. Hansel, Ben, and Mina follow Muriel's trail to the original gingerbread house. Muriel wounds Ben and kills Mina before Hansel shoots her several times, knocking her into the house. Gretel arrives and the pair engage Muriel in a brutal fight that ends with Gretel decapitating her with a shovel. They burn Muriel's body on a pyre and collect their reward for rescuing the children. They head out on their next witch hunt accompanied by Ben and Edward.|$|E

25|$|They then venerate {{the holy}} table {{and put on}} their vestments. Before putting on each vestment the priest says a prayer, usually drawn from the Psalms, bless the vestment, and kiss the cross that is sewn onto it. The deacon brings his vestments to the priest <b>to</b> <b>bless</b> and then kisses the priest's hand and withdraws to vest, saying the same prayers for the sticharia as the priest and kissing the cross on each vestment. Each subdeacon and server vesting bring his sticharion to the priest for him <b>to</b> <b>bless,</b> and then kisses the cross on it before vesting. If a bishop is present, the clergy bring their vestments for him <b>to</b> <b>bless</b> before putting them on.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the temple}} and priesthood {{restrictions}} before 1978, black members of African descent could {{not receive the}} priesthood or participate in temple ordinances besides baptisms for the dead. For {{a time in the}} 1960s and 1970s, they were not allowed to perform baptisms for the dead either. For young men and men in the LDS church, holding the priesthood is required to hold leadership roles, perform baptisms, <b>to</b> <b>bless</b> the sacrament, <b>to</b> <b>bless</b> babies and <b>to</b> <b>bless</b> the sick. Since black men could not hold the priesthood, they were excluded from holding leadership roles and performing these rituals. Temple ordinances are necessary for members to receive the endowment and marriage sealings necessary for exaltation, and black members could not enjoy these privileges. Church leaders taught that these restrictions were commanded by God. In 1978, the First Presidency and the Twelve, led by Spencer W. Kimball, declared they had received a revelation instructing them to reverse the racial restriction policy. After this revelation, black men could receive the priesthood and black people could receive temple ordinances.|$|E
25|$|House Blessings: On Theophany {{the priest}} will begin making {{the round of}} the parishioner's homes <b>to</b> <b>bless</b> them. He will perform a short prayer service in each home, and then go through the entire house, gardens and outside-buildings, blessing them with the newly blessed Theophany Water, while all sing the Troparion and Kontakion of the feast. This is {{normally}} done on Theophany, or at least during the Afterfeast, but if the parishioners are numerous, and especially if many live {{far away from the}} church, it may take some time <b>to</b> <b>bless</b> each house. Traditionally, these blessings should all be finished before the beginning of Great Lent).|$|E

25|$|This bough {{forms an}} {{important}} plot {{detail of the}} story Aldarion and Erendis. According to the narrative, King Tar-Meneldur at one point refused <b>to</b> <b>bless</b> his son Aldarion's sailing to Middle-earth and forbade his kin to set oiolairë upon the ship; and Erendis won Aldarion's love by doing this instead. She set it several times later, though her love for Aldarion gradually lessened; but after a bough became frozen during one journey, Erendis disapproved completely of Aldarion's journeys. Another woman used <b>to</b> <b>bless</b> his ships for some time, until Aldarion forsook the tradition and instead placed upon the prow an image of an eagle presented to him by Círdan; by that time he had finally breached with Erendis.|$|E
