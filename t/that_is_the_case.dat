5|$|Some philosophers, such as Paul Boghossian, have {{attempted}} to show that eliminativism is in some sense self-refuting, since the theory itself presupposes the existence of mental phenomena. If eliminativism is true, then the eliminativist must permit an intentional property like truth, supposing {{that in order to}} assert something one must believe it. Hence, for eliminativism to be asserted as a thesis, the eliminativist must believe that it is true; if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> then there are beliefs and the eliminativist claim is false.|$|E

25|$|A third {{interpretation}} {{relies on}} the theory that an individual form is capable of having properties of its own.

25|$|The {{species is}} only {{partially}} able to self-pollinate because of dichogamy in its flowering. This limitation, {{added to the}} long juvenile period, makes the species difficult to breed.

Modern breeding programs tend to use isolation plots where the chances of cross-pollination are reduced. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for programs at the University of California, Riverside, {{as well as the}} Volcani Centre and the Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias in Chile.|$|E

25|$|The Viennese oyster {{position}} requires great flexibility {{from the}} woman to perform. The female lies {{on her back and}} moves her legs behind her head, with the groin area being completely exposed. The male partner penetrates the vagina from the top. This is a deep penetrating position and may not be suitable for men with larger than average penis size. However, in most cases, the female will not be flexible enough to achieve this position fully, and will need to stop well before the legs are behind the head. If <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> the male partner can help hold the legs in a comfortable position and continue on with intercourse.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} aspects of the organization of the Inquisition was its form of financing: devoid of its own budget, the Inquisition depended exclusively on the confiscation of the goods of the denounced. It is not surprising, therefore, that many of those prosecuted were rich men. That the situation was open to abuse is evident, as stands out in the memorial that a converso from Toledo directed to Charles I: Your Majesty must provide, before all else, that the expenses of the Holy Office do not come from the properties of the condemned, because if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> if they do not burn they do not eat.|$|E
25|$|Opioids include opiates, {{an older}} term {{that refers to}} such drugs derived from opium, {{including}} morphine itself. Other opioids are semi-synthetic and synthetic drugs such as hydrocodone, oxycodone and fentanyl; antagonist drugs such as naloxone; and endogenous peptides such as the endorphins. The terms opiate and narcotic are sometimes encountered as synonyms for opioid. Opiate is properly limited to the natural alkaloids found in the resin of the opium poppy although some include semi-synthetic derivatives. Narcotic, derived from words meaning 'numbness' or 'sleep', as an American legal term, refers to cocaine and opioids, and their source materials; it is also loosely applied to any illegal or controlled psychoactive drug. In some jurisdictions all controlled drugs are legally classified as narcotics. The term can have pejorative connotations and its use is generally discouraged where <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

30|$|One {{interpretation}} of this set of results <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> participants performed similarly between the modes; this led the raters to assign similar ratings to their performance during each of <b>the</b> modes. If <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> <b>the</b> findings for <b>the</b> analytic scales <b>were</b> {{consistent with those of}} studies on tape-based speaking tests that used the ACTFL holistic scale (Kenyon and Tschirner 2000; Shohamy 2004). Thus, it appears <b>that</b> delivery mode <b>is</b> not a factor that affects the magnitude of scores, regardless of the type of rating scale used. However, more empirical evidence is needed to support this conclusion.|$|R
25|$|During the 1950s, Lionel outsold {{its closest}} competitor, American Flyer, by nearly 2:1, peaking in 1953.

Had <b>that</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> it <b>was</b> a short-lived greatness: Lionel's 1955 sales were some $23 million, while rival Marx's toy (more than just trains) sales were $50 million.|$|R
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of transport for importers supports the alternating-access model. The resting state of importers is inward-facing, where the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) dimer interface is held open by the TMDs and facing outward but occluded from the cytoplasm. Upon docking of the closed, substrate-loaded binding protein towards the periplasmic {{side of the}} transmembrane domains, ATP binds and the NBD dimer closes. This switches the resting state of transporter into an outward-facing conformation, in which the TMDs have reoriented to receive substrate from the binding protein. After hydrolysis of ATP, the NBD dimer opens and substrate is released into the cytoplasm. Release of ADP and Pi reverts the transporter into its resting state. The only inconsistency of this mechanism to the ATP-switch model is that the conformation in its resting, nucleotide-free state {{is different from the}} expected outward-facing conformation. Although <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> the key point is that the NBD does not dimerize unless ATP and binding protein is bound to the transporter.|$|E
25|$|Glucose-6-phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} deficiency (G6PD deficiency), a form {{of which}} is known as favism (after the fava bean), is an X-linked recessive inborn error of metabolism that predisposes to hemolysis (spontaneous destruction of red blood cells) and resultant jaundice {{in response to a}} number of triggers, such as certain foods, illness, or medication. It is particularly common in people of Mediterranean and African origin. The condition is characterized by abnormally low levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway that is especially important in the red blood cell. G6PD deficiency is the most common human enzyme condition. There is no specific treatment, other than avoiding known triggers. In the United States, no genetic screening of prospective parents is recommended, as the symptoms only show in part of the carriers and when <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> they can be prevented or controlled, and as a result the condition generally has no impact on the lifespan of those affected. However, globally G6PD deficiency has resulted in 4,100 deaths in 2013 and 3,400 deaths in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Climate {{change was}} {{referred}} to in several of Giddens’s books from the mid-1990s onwards, but was not discussed at length until {{the publication of his}} work The Politics of Climate Change in 2009. Climate change, Giddens says, constitutes a fundamental threat to the future of industrial civilisation as it spreads across the globe. Given <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> he asks, why are countries around the world doing so little to counter its advance? Many reasons are involved, but the prime one is the historical novelty of humanly induced climate change itself. No previous civilisation intervened into nature on a level remotely similar to that which we do on an everyday level today. We have no previous experience of dealing with such an issue and especially one of such global scope, or of the dangers it poses. Those dangers hence appear as abstract, and located at some indefinite point in the future. ‘Giddens’s paradox’ consists of the following theorem. We are likely put off responding adequately to climate change until major catastrophes unequivocally connected to it occur; but by then by definition it will be too late. For {{we have no way of}} reversing the build-up of greenhouses gases that is driving the transformation of the world’s climate. Some such gases will be in the atmosphere for centuries.|$|E
