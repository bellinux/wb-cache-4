50|$|According to the Army, the M4 only {{suffered}} 296 stoppages, {{and said}} that the high number reported could be attributed to discrepancies in the scoring process. The Army testing command stated that if the number of stoppages caused by a broken part met some threshold, they would be eliminated from the final report pending redesign of the part. Colt also claimed that <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> were unfair to the M4, as the M4s used in the test were normal guns from active inventory, with remaining service life varying randomly. Further, the trial M4s had burst-mode fire groups, which are more complicated and prone to failure than the fully automatic fire groups the other manufacturers presented for testing.|$|E

50|$|At Aintree Racecourse in April Cyborgo {{was moved}} up in class for the Grade II Mersey Novices' Hurdle over {{two and a}} half miles on heavy ground. The odds-on {{favourite}} was Large Action who had shown exceptional form for a novice by winning the Tote Gold Trophy and finishing third, beaten two and quarter lengths by Flakey Dove in the Champion Hurdle. Cyborgo started 8/1 second choice in the betting alongside the Irish challenger Monalee River. Dunwoody sent Cyborgo into the lead from the start and the gelding maintained his advantage until overtaken by Large Action and Monalee River at the third last. As his rivals began to struggle in <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions,</b> Cyborgo rallied to regain the lead near the finish and won by one and a quarter lengths from Monalee River, with Large Action one and a half lengths back in third.

5000|$|Creators Stephen Giffin and John Hannah [...] {{state in}} their three part {{broadcast}} [...] on Channel 9 (discussion forum) that MVC4WPF {{is designed to}} take advantage of the MVC pattern’s flexibility in problem solving while the PAC pattern provides a hierarchy through parent-child controller interactions. All interactions between layers are managed by contracts which dictate the terms which parent and child layers interact. Because of these contracts, the model, view and controller layers have a great deal of flexibility in how they interact, handle data, or are constructed. All that is required is that contract terms are met. For example, a model (data) layer may consist of a local database, Web feeds, or any other information provided that the given model meets all of the requirements of its contract. This contract-centered approach increases the potential flexibility of applications as well as proscribes the conditions for testing code (i.e. contracts set <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions).</b> It also promotes development specialization, as developers only need to understand their area of expertise and how to meet their contract requirements.|$|E

50|$|Flash of Steel {{began his}} second season in the Tetrarch Stakes over seven furlongs on soft ground at the Curragh in April. Ridden by Kinane he won by three {{quarters}} of a length from Equator, to whom he was conceding nine pounds in weight. The 1986 edition of the Irish 2000 Guineas, run on heavy ground at the Curragh on 17 May drew an unusually small field of six, with three Irish-trained colts being matched against three British challengers. The British appeared to have a clear advantage as the Dick Hern-trained Sharrood started favourite ahead of Huntingdale and Green Desert whilst Flash of Steel was the 9/2 fourth choice in the betting alongside Fioravanti. The only other runner was Mr John who had finished fourth in the Tetrarch Stakes. Sharrood set a steady pace with Kinane positioning Flash of Steel towards the rear of the closely grouped field. In the last quarter mile most of the runners began to struggle in <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> but Flash of Steel stayed on strongly, took the lead a furlong out and won by {{three quarters of a}} length from Mr John. As in the Beresford Stakes he hung to the right in the closing stages, slightly hampering the runner-up but there was no stewards' inquiry and the result stood.|$|E
50|$|After a {{break of}} well over two months Mountain Lodge {{returned}} in the Doncaster Cup in September and came from well off the pace to finish third behind Karadar and Gildoran. The 1983 Irish St Leger, run over {{one and three}} quarter miles at the Curragh Racecourse on 8 October, was {{the first edition of}} the race to be open to older horses instead of being restricted to three-year-olds. Heavy rain in the build-up resulted in very soft ground and conditions were not improved by a thick mist which restricted visibility. The British colt Band (winner of the Cumberland Lodge Stakes) started favourite ahead of Colonial Flag (representing the Vincent O'Brien stable) and Yawa (Grand Prix de Paris) with Mountain Lodge, who was epected to relish <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions,</b> net in the betting on 13/2. The best of the other si runners appeared to be the British four-year-old Khairpour, who had finished ahead of Mountain Lodge at andown and later won the Geoffrey Freer Stakes. Little of the early stages were clearly visible but High Cannon appeared to make the running before Arctic Lord led the field into the straight. Band went to the front in the traight, but Mountain Lodge, ridden by Declan Gillespie, wore down the tiring favourite in the final furlong and won going away by two lengths.|$|E
50|$|The 1987 Cheltenham Gold Cup, run on 19 March was the 60th {{running of}} Britain's most prestigious steeplechase. Arthur Stephenson {{was not at}} Cheltenham, preferring to attend the meeting at Hexham, where he had seven runners, and The Thinker {{was taken to the}} course by Stephenson's nephew Peter Cheeseborough. The twelve runner field was headed by the 5/4 {{favourite}} Forgive 'n' Forget who had won the race in 1985, whilst the other runners included Door Latch and Bolands Cross (second and third behind Desert Orchid in the King George VI Chase, Wayward Lad, Charter Party, Combs Ditch, Earls Brig and West Tip. The Thinker, ridden by Ridley Lamb started at odds of 13/2 after considerable late support from gamblers who felt he would be well-suited by <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions.</b> An hour before the race, snow fell heavily on the course rendering the conditions virtually unraceable and the runners for the Gold Cup, having {{made their way to the}} start, were recalled to the paddock. After a delay of well over an hour, during which the snow began to melt, the runners were recalled to the start and the race began. Lamb settled The Thinker towards the rear of the field in the early stages as Cybrandian led the field on the first circuit. Charter Party fell at the fifth whilst Earls Brig was pulled up early on the second circuit and Bolands Cross fell at the fifteenth. Four fences from the finish, Cybrandian led from Door Latch, but The Thinker had made steady progress into third ahead of Forgive 'n' Forge, Wayward Lad an Combs Ditch. The Thinker moved into second but made a bad jumping error at the third last and turned into the straight in third place behind Cybrandian and Wayward Lad. The Thinker maintained his position over the last two fences before tracking to the right on the run-in and producing a strong late run to overtake Cybrandian in the last hundred yards and win by one and a half lengths. Door Latch and West Tip finished well to take third and fourth ahead of Wayward Lad.|$|E

40|$|The {{injection}} of a plain jet of kerosene Jet A- 1 fuel into a crossflow of air was investigated experimentally regarding fuel placement, spray characteristics, and evaporation. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> chosen were {{a test case}} relevant to LPP (lean premixed prevaporized combustion) for gas turbines (pair= 15. 5 bar, Tair= 750 K) and <b>the</b> corresponding cold <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> in terms of air density (pair= 6 bar, Tair= 290 K). Both test cases were investigated in the absence {{as well as in}} the presence of a filmer plate on which part of the nascent fuel spray impinges. The nozzle diameter was 0. 45 mm and the fuel flowrate was 2. 94 g/s, so that the fuel-to-air momentum flux ratio q (q=(rliq*uliq 2) /(rair*uair 2)) assumed a value of 6. Measurement techniques employed include time-resolved shadowgraphs and Phase-Doppler-Anemometry (PDA).

40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanical}} properties of a Cu- 2. 16 Ni- 0. 72 Si alloy in a hardened state are investigated {{at room temperature}} (RT) and up to 573 K through tensile tests performed at slow and fast straining rates. In the upper temperature range the material ductility exhibits an anomalous behaviour typical of dynamic embrittlement: the ductility decreases with increasing temperature or/and with decreasing straining rate. SEM observations confirm that result: the fracture surfaces of the broken specimens are predominantly of ductile type at RT, while they are covered of many intergranular facets for specimens tested in the upper temperature range at slow straining rate. The role of stress is predominant in the mechanism of embrittlement. A model of dynamic embrittlement controlled by diffusion is used to derive a factor of embrittlement, SDE, related to <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions.</b> This factor appears to be well correlated with the variation of the ductility linked with <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|E
