5|$|Several {{days prior}} to Fabian {{striking}} Bermuda, computer models forecast a ridge of high pressure forcing the hurricane {{to the west of}} the island by 200miles (320km). Not expected to be a direct threat, a meteorologist at <b>the</b> <b>Bermuda</b> Weather Service expected gusty winds and potentially heavy rainfall. Each successive advisory brought the hurricane steadily closer to Bermuda, and 35hours before Fabian made its closest approach, <b>the</b> <b>Bermuda</b> Weather Service issued a hurricane watch for the island. When a track near Bermuda became more certain, a hurricane warning was issued for the island, approximately 29hours before Fabian made a direct hit on the island.|$|E
5|$|After retiring, Goater {{returned}} to Bermuda, receiving an official welcome from the Premier of Bermuda Alex Scott on his arrival. A week later, Southend played <b>the</b> <b>Bermuda</b> national team in an appreciation game for their former striker. Goater has expressed a wish to enter coaching following his retirement, and studied for the UEFA B coaching licence in 2005. Since 2003, Goater has organised the annual Shaun Goater Grass-roots Soccer Festival, a football coaching event {{for children in}} Bermuda. On 14 September 2006, Goater and the United Soccer Leagues announced that Bermuda would receive a professional football team that would play in the third division of American football, the USL Second Division. Goater had roles as both a director and player of the team, <b>the</b> <b>Bermuda</b> Hogges. Goater left Bermuda Hogges in 2008, to concentrate on youth coaching with North Village Rams in his home town.|$|E

5|$|In June 2012, Sea World {{applied for}} a permit to {{demolish}} <b>the</b> <b>Bermuda</b> Triangle water ride system and the interior of its show building. <b>The</b> <b>Bermuda</b> Triangle had been sitting dormant since its closure in October 2010 and had been earmarked by the park as a site for a future attraction. On 12 July 2012, Christian von Elverfeldt from Mack Rides revealed Australia would be receiving a water roller coaster in 2013; leading to speculation that Sea World might have revived its plans. Further development application filings, and reports by the Roller Coaster DataBase and the Gold Coast Bulletin, confirmed this speculation. In September 2012, Sea World asked Austrian firm Dynamic Motion Rides (DyMoRides) to develop a theming and show design concept for the yet-to-be-announced Storm Coaster. DyMoRides was ultimately contracted for the full turnkey project in April 2013. DyMoRides subsequently contracted PEL Creative for creative direction, Full-On Lighting for lighting design, Volume One for audio and visual effects, and Sculpt Studios for theming design.|$|E

5|$|On October 9, one {{day prior}} to Nicole forming, <b>the</b> <b>Bermuda</b> Weather Service issued a gale warning for the island. The agency also issued a Tropical Storm Watch {{shortly after the}} storm developed. All {{warnings}} were canceled after the storm passed the island. Winds on Bermuda peaked at 44mph (71km/h) in association with Nicole, while gusts peaked at 60mph (97km/h) prior to the storm developing. Nicole and the precursor extratropical storm dropped heavy precipitation, amounting to 5.86inches (148mm) over a three-day period at <b>the</b> <b>Bermuda</b> International Airport. Thunderstorms were also reported on the island. Poor weather conditions from Nicole forced the cancellation of several events at the tourist-driven Bermuda Music Festival, including acts by Isaac Hayes, Gerald Albright, and Anita Baker. Strong winds knocked down power lines, leaving over 1,800 homes and businesses without power. Unsettled conditions also resulted in airport delays. High winds delayed or altered the courses of four cruise ships. High waves of 10 to 12-foot (3 to 3.6 m) in height left several cruise ship passengers seasick; one sick person was rushed to a local hospital on Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Original {{plans for}} a Water Coaster at Sea World were {{released}} by the local council in 2008; however, they were put on hold. In 2010, <b>the</b> <b>Bermuda</b> Triangle ride closed, sitting dormant until mid-2012 when construction for the Storm Coaster began. After demolition works were completed, track for the Storm Coaster arrived at Sea World, taking five months to erect. Storm Coaster officially {{opened to the public}} on 6 December 2013.|$|E
5|$|Structural damage {{ranged from}} the {{superficial}} to complete wall or roof failure, the latter being relatively uncommon. A multitude of buildings, including churches, a visitor's center, the House of Assembly building in Hamilton, and <b>the</b> <b>Bermuda</b> Police Service headquarters at Prospect Camp, suffered some degree of roof damage. Older structures were particularly prone to substantial damage, as were commercial storage buildings subject to less strict building codes. In December, five new slate quarries were approved to accommodate the demand for roofing materials. Both the new and old portions of the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital received significant damage that exposed the facilities to the elements. An exhibit at <b>the</b> <b>Bermuda</b> Aquarium, Museum and Zoo was unroofed, and coastal erosion threatened to encroach on the site, though no animals were harmed. Part of the structure's roof was blown a quarter mile (400 m).|$|E

5|$|Arthur and {{his mother}} Atlanna are flying over <b>the</b> <b>Bermuda</b> Triangle. As they get closer, Atlanna's {{necklace}} begins to glow and a surge of light and energy erupts from the ocean, causing cyclones which bring their plane down. Atlanna is kidnapped by a siren, but not before giving Arthur her necklace and calling him Orin. Ten years later, Arthur is charged for releasing dolphins from a marine park. His father bails him out of trouble, but gives him a stern lecture on responsibility. Later, Arthur tells his friend Eva that he felt like the dolphins were calling to him. While he's working, he is approached by a lighthouse keeper who identifies himself as McCaffery. The Coast Guard picks up an unidentified man floating in <b>the</b> <b>Bermuda</b> Triangle and pleading to warn Orin. Lt. Torres is sent to investigate the area. Arthur is also at the Triangle, and his necklace triggers another surge of light, which causes Torres to crash her jet. Brigman transports the John Doe to another facility, and persuades Torres to join his team. Brigman {{is looking for a}} connection between the disappearances of thousands of individuals, and their reappearance years later without ever aging a day.|$|E

5|$|Identified by {{its lack}} of {{associated}} frontal boundaries and closed circulation center, the first tropical cyclone of the 1911 season formed on August 4 over southern Alabama in the United States. At only tropical depression strength, it tracked eastward and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean the next day. Several days later, while located near Bermuda, the depression became a tropical storm and turned northeastward. The storm lasted several more days until dissipating on August 11. The storm produced heavy rainfall on <b>the</b> <b>Bermuda,</b> but no gale-force winds were reported. The storm was unknown until the 2005 Atlantic hurricane database revision recognized it as a tropical storm.|$|E

This occurred when neither Terceira nor Nisbett qualified for an Olympic {{spot at the}} equestrian finals in Hong Kong, caused {{in part by the}} injury of Terceira's horse, Navantus. Because Bermuda was allowed only one horse rider, <b>the</b> <b>Bermuda</b> Equestrian Federation awarded their one reserved Olympic spot to Nisbett because Terceira's horse had been injured {{during the course of the}} event.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, as the {{precursor}} extratropical storm was forming, <b>the</b> <b>Bermuda</b> Weather Service issued a gale {{and later a}} storm warning for the island, expecting winds of 50 to 60mph (60 to 95km/h). Several radio interviews and television stations issued information on the expected storm. Many residents believed they were insufficiently warned, though it is acknowledged that emergency managers and citizens pay less attention to gale warnings then they do for tropical cyclone warnings. On October 12, as the storm was passing {{to the south of}} the island, officials closed all schools and government offices. Many private businesses closed as well.|$|E

5|$|The Picidae {{are just}} one of eight living {{families}} in the order Piciformes, the others being barbets, toucans, and honeyguides in the clade Pici, and the jacamars and puffbirds in the clade Galbuli. DNA sequencing has confirmed the sister relationships of these two groups. The family Picidae includes about 240 species arranged in 35 genera. Almost 20 species are threatened with extinction due to loss of habitat or habitat fragmentation, with one, <b>the</b> <b>Bermuda</b> flicker, being extinct and a further two probably being so.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{transitioning}} into {{a tropical}} cyclone, the depression executed an elongated counter-clockwise loop to the northeast. Conditions favored further intensification, {{and based on}} ship reports, it is estimated the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bertha early on July28. Bertha quickly strengthened to attain hurricane status early on July29 about halfway between Cape Canaveral, Florida and Bermuda. The strengthening trend was brief, however, as increased vertical wind shear weakened it back to a tropical storm late on July29, with the center exposed from the deep convection. Bertha continued slowly northeastward to ridging from <b>the</b> <b>Bermuda</b> high extending westward to the United States.|$|E
