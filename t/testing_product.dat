40|$|Background/Purpose: In {{the frame}} of a {{development}} of a formulation {{to be used in}} perineal mas-sage in pregnant women, a screening program was built up among compositions with elasticising properties. Methods: This was an open-label, controlled study in 21 volunteers. The participants applied once, on the volar surface of both forearms, five formulations with elasticising properties (<b>test</b> <b>products</b> 1 to 5) and a reference standard (<b>test</b> <b>product</b> 6). The formulations were applied on three sites on each forearm that were randomly assigned. Skin elasticising parameters were evaluated using the Dermal Torque Meter, at baseline and 30 minutes after application. Results: Among the <b>test</b> <b>products,</b> only <b>test</b> <b>product</b> 2 significantly increased skin elasticity compared with the baseline value, with a trend toward superiority versus the reference standard (+ 24 % vs. + 13 %, respectively). There was a significant increase in elastic recovery of 23 % with <b>test</b> <b>product</b> 2, compared with a significant increase of 13 % with the reference standard. Conclusion: Test prod-uct 2, comprising a thiolated compound and a mixture of esters of fatty acids, had the greatest elasticising effect.

The idea is that the ductwork must remain operable even while exposed to fire for a duration stipulated for each occupancy by the local building code. The electrical equipment supplying power to such systems must also be equipped with approved circuit integrity measures. Both ventilation and power systems must have a demonstrable fire-resistance rating that is acceptable to the authority having jurisdiction.|$|E

A serial {{entrepreneur}} by nature, Duffie also founded Turnstone Systems, which went public in 2000; and Whitetree Inc., a network switch maker that was acquired in 1997 by Ascend Communications. Fanfare was the first company to commercialize an automated <b>testing</b> <b>product</b> that addressed the testing challenges around increasingly complex network devices. To get the job done, feature testers and device testers tend to rely on traditional script-based automation, a time-intensive approach that requires highly trained manual testers to accomplish. With this approach, it can take hours or days to set up devices, configure test beds, and communicate basic test reports. Language barriers from geographically dispersed QA teams exacerbate the problem, resulting in duplicated efforts and reduced productivity.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Literature data {{relevant}} to the decision to allow a waiver of in vivo bioequiva-lence (BE) testing for the approval of immediate release (IR) solid oral dosage forms containing metronidazole are reviewed. Metronidazole can be assigned to Biopharmaceutics Classifica-tion System Class I. Most BE studies that were identified reported the investigated formu-lations to be bioequivalent, indicating the risk of bioinequivalence to be low. Formulations showing differences in bioavailability showed dissimilarities in in vitro dissolution profiles. Furthermore, metronidazole has a wide therapeutic index. It is concluded that a biowaiver for solid IR formulations is justified, provided: (a) the <b>test</b> <b>product</b> and its comparator are both rapidly dissolving; (b) meet similarity of the dissolution profiles at pH 1. 2, 4. 5, and 6. 8; (c) the <b>test</b> <b>product</b> contains only excipients present in IR drug products approved in Interna-tional Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) or associated countries in the same dosage form; and (d) if the <b>test</b> <b>product</b> contains sorbitol, sodium laurilsulfate, or propylene glycol.

50|$|Creating a cast {{urethane}} {{master pattern}} {{is different from}} the steps involved in creating hard tooling for injection molding. Hard tools for injection molding are going to be subjected to a lot of stress and heat during the injection process. They will see runs of thousands of parts per day. The care that goes into a hard tool involves intense machine programming which costs thousands of dollars alone. The price for hard tooling is balanced by the mass production the tooling brings, which is where cast urethanes begin to differ. Cast urethanes are suited for smaller runs of parts and prototyping. Because the cost for soft tooling is lower, down in the hundreds rather than hundreds of thousands, cast urethanes are excellent resources for creators still <b>testing</b> <b>product</b> design, for one-off products, or for testing market and consumer response to a new product.|$|E
