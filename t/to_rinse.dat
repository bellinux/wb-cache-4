25|$|The largest {{bacterial}} {{populations are}} found in the filter, where is high water flow and plentiful surface available for their growth, so effective and efficient filtration is vital. Sometimes, a vigorous cleaning of the filter is enough to seriously disturb the biological balance of an aquarium. Therefore, it is recommended <b>to</b> <b>rinse</b> mechanical filters in an outside bucket of aquarium water to dislodge organic materials that contribute to nitrate problems, while preserving bacteria populations. Another safe practice consists of cleaning only half of the filter media during each service, or using two filters, only one of which is cleaned at a time.|$|E

For example, increasing the proportion of solvating agent <b>to</b> <b>rinsing</b> agent in the mixture increases the solvency, and thus is used for removing heavier soils.|$|R

Dental caries and {{periodontal}} disease are major problem of oral health that {{is caused by}} accumulation of plaque bacteria on dental surfaces and subgingival. Oral health can be enhanced by removing or preventing the accumulation of dental plaque or can be called as plaque control. Plaque contol can be applied by rinsing with chemicals such as 0, 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate solution or using natural substance such as gambier stew. The aim {{of this research is}} to know the average difference of plaque score by rinsing with 0, 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate solution and gambier stew. It is also to know which of those two mouthwash that more effective in reduction of plaque score. This research used an experimental method with pretest and posttest only control group design. Subjects of this research retrieved using total sampling technique and suitable with inclusion criteria. Subjects were divided into two groups, there are one group that was ordered <b>to</b> <b>rinsing</b> with 0, 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate solution and another group was ordered <b>to</b> <b>rinsing</b> with gambier stew.

25|$|Medical hand-washing is for {{a minimum}} of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands.

Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important <b>to</b> <b>rinse</b> well and wipe dry with a clean towel. After drying, the paper towel should be used to turn off the water (and open any exit door if necessary). This avoids re-contaminating the hands from those surfaces.|$|E

2500|$|Less {{than three}} months after the murder of Smith, Dahmer {{encountered}} a 22-year-old Chicago native named Ernest Miller on the corner of North 27th Street. Miller agreed to accompany Dahmer to his apartment for $50 and further agreed to allow him to listen to his heart and stomach. When Dahmer attempted to perform oral sex upon Miller, he was informed: [...] "That'll cost you extra," [...] whereupon Dahmer gave his intended victim a drink laced with two sleeping pills. On this occasion, however, he had had only two sleeping pills to give his victim; therefore, he killed Miller by slashing his carotid artery with the same knife he used to dissect his victims' bodies. Miller bled to death within minutes. Dahmer then posed the nude body for various suggestive Polaroid photographs before placing the body in his bathtub for dismemberment. Dahmer repeatedly kissed and talked to the severed head while he dismembered the remainder of the body. He wrapped Miller's heart, biceps, and portions of flesh from the legs in plastic bags and placed them in the fridge for later consumption. Dahmer boiled the remaining flesh and organs into a [...] "jelly-like substance" [...] using Soilex, which again enabled him <b>to</b> <b>rinse</b> the flesh off the skeleton, which he intended to retain. To preserve the skeleton, he placed the bones in a light bleach solution for 24hours before allowing them to dry upon a cloth for one week; the severed head was initially placed in the fridge before also being stripped of flesh, then painted and coated with enamel.|$|E
