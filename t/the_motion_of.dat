5|$|Front {{tracking}} {{methods have}} long been used in fluid dynamics to model and track <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> boundaries between different materials, of steep gradients in material properties such as weather fronts, or of shock waves within a single material. These methods involve deriving the equations of motion of the boundary, and using them to directly simulate <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> the boundary, rather than simulating the underlying fluid and treating the boundary as an emergent property of the fluid. The same methods {{can also be used}} to simulate the curve-shortening flow, even when the curve undergoing the flow is not a boundary or shock.|$|E
5|$|Most ionic {{compounds}} {{are very}} brittle. Once {{they reach the}} limit of their strength, they cannot deform mealleably, because the strict alignment {{of positive and negative}} ions must be maintained. Instead the material undergoes fracture via cleavage. As the temperature is elevated (usually close to the melting point) a ductile–brittle transition occurs, and plastic flow becomes possible by <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> dislocations.|$|E

5|$|A lattice gas {{automaton}} is {{a cellular}} automaton designed to simulate <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> particles in a fluid or an ideal gas. In such a system, gas particles move on straight lines with constant velocity, until undergoing elastic collision with other particles.

In probability theory and statistics, stochastic matrices are used to describe sets of probabilities; for instance, they are used within the PageRank algorithm that ranks the pages in a Google search. Matrix calculus generalizes classical analytical notions such as derivatives and exponentials to higher dimensions. Matrices are used in economics to describe systems of economic relationships.|$|E

A bubble-propulsion mechanism {{has the advantage of}} producing a stronger force and higher speed than other mechanisms for catalytic micromotors, but the nature of the fluctuated bubble generation process affects <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> micromotors, making it difficult to control their <b>motions.</b> Thus, understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> influence of fluctuating bubble propulsion on <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> catalytic micromotors is important in exploiting the advantages of bubble-propelled micromotors. Here, we report experimental demonstrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bubble-propelled <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> propeller-shaped micromotors and numerical analyses of the influence of fluctuating bubble propulsion on <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> propeller-shaped micromotors. We found that motions such as trochoid-like motion and circular motion emerged depending on the magnitude or symmetricity of fluctuations in the bubble-propulsion process. We hope that those results will help in the construction and application of sophisticated bubble-propelled micromotors in the future...|$|R

5|$|Bacterial species {{differ in}} the number and {{arrangement}} of flagella on their surface; some have a single flagellum (monotrichous), a flagellum at each end (amphitrichous), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell (lophotrichous), while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell (peritrichous). The bacterial flagella is the best-understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly. The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that uses the electrochemical gradient across the membrane for power. This motor drives <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> the filament, which acts as a propeller.|$|E

System III was first defined by radio astronomers, and corresponds to the rotation of the planet's magnetosphere; its period is Jupiter's official rotation.|$|E
5|$|By {{historical}} convention, {{a positive}} current {{is defined as}} having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part.

However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.|$|E
