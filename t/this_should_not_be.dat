5|$|They can be playful {{with other}} dogs, and {{get along with}} horses. The breed {{standard}} requires that shyness {{be treated as a}} fault, although it states that <b>this</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> confused with submissiveness which is not treated as such. Overt aggression towards another dog is not accepted and is a criterion for disqualification in the show ring.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} the Damascus government began an overwhelmingly anti-Iraqi Ba'athist propaganda campaign, {{to which their}} counterparts in Baghdad responded. However, the Iraqi Ba'athists helped Assad, who at the 4th Regional Congress of the Syrian Regional Branch called for the reunification of the Ba'ath Party, {{in his attempt to}} seize power from Jadid. It was reported that Assad promised the Iraqis to recognize Aflaq's historical leadership. Iraq's foreign minister Abd al-Karim al-Shaykli even had his own personal office in the Syrian Ministry of Defence, which Assad headed. However, <b>this</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> misconstrued, the Iraqi Regional Branch was Arab nationalist in name only, and was in fact Iraqi nationalist.|$|E

25|$|In general, indices {{can range}} over any {{indexing}} set, including an infinite set. <b>This</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> confused with a typographically similar convention used {{to distinguish between}} tensor index notation and the closely related but distinct basis-independent abstract index notation.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{signatures}} {{that arise in}} algebra often contain only function symbols, a signature with no relation symbols is called an algebraic signature.

25|$|Although {{the motion}} of the Crookes {{radiometer}} was originally attributed to light pressure, this interpretation is incorrect; the characteristic Crookes rotation {{is the result of a}} partial vacuum. <b>This</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> confused with the Nichols radiometer, in which the (slight) motion caused by torque (though not enough for full rotation against friction) is directly caused by light pressure.|$|E
25|$|In the Third Step members {{surrender}} {{their will}} to a Higher Power, <b>this</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> understood as encouraging passiveness, rather {{its purpose is}} to increase acceptance of reality. The process of working the Twelve Steps is intended to replace self-centeredness with a growing moral consciousness and a willingness for self-sacrifice and unselfish constructive action; {{this is known as}} a spiritual awakening, or religious experience.|$|E
25|$|Alkanes from {{hexadecane}} upwards {{form the}} most important components of fuel oil and lubricating oil. In the latter function, they work {{at the same time}} as anti-corrosive agents, as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface.

25|$|One {{can obtain}} a {{different}} result {{by taking the}} above construction, and replacing every occurrence of the tensor product by the exterior product.

25|$|A {{large amount}} of {{parliamentary}} time was spent debating {{the application of the}} cab-rank rule to new legal professionals granted rights of audience – the Bar argued that all people with rights of audience in the higher courts should be subject to the same rules as barristers, while the Law Society argued that solicitors were not at that time bound by the cab-rank rule in their dealings in the lower courts, {{and that there was no}} reason why <b>this</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> extended to the higher courts.|$|E
25|$|Currently people subsist {{mainly on}} agriculture. They follow a {{traditional}} transhumance system {{known as the}} Godantu system, a key feature of traditional human use of the Bale Mountains. In this system, livestock, particularly cattle, are sent to higher grazing grounds during the months when crops are growing in lower altitudes or into the forest for shade during the dry season. However <b>this</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> confused with the cattle movements that are {{a consequence of the}} loss of grazing land outside of the park, thus forcing cattle into the park to graze.|$|E
