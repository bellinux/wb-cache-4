5|$|Behaviorists {{focus on}} the {{acquisition}} and teaching of delayed gratification, and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay. Behavior analysts capitalize on the effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards contingent on the person's current behavior, which promotes learning a delay of gratification. It {{is important to note}} that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed, <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> must have some value to the participant. Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> is not a strong reinforcer of the desired behavior.|$|E
5|$|Children {{under five}} years old display the least {{effective}} strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> and thinking about its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity of focusing on <b>the</b> <b>reward.</b> Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self-instructions to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> and thereby increase the delay. Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood. Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other brain regions). Declines in self-regulation and impulse control in old age predict corresponding declines in reward-delaying strategies, specifically reduced temporal discounting due to a decrease in cooling strategies.|$|E

30|$|A {{weighted}} reward criterion {{consists of}} a weighted combination of <b>the</b> average <b>reward</b> criterion and <b>the</b> discounted <b>reward</b> criterion. <b>The</b> decision maker can pay more or less emphasis on <b>the</b> long-term <b>reward</b> versus short-term reward by changing their associated weights. Krass et al. (1992) presented a general formula as shown in Eq. (1) to calculate <b>the</b> weighted <b>reward</b> in terms of <b>the</b> average <b>reward</b> and <b>the</b> discounted <b>reward.</b> This “weighted reward” is a convex combination of <b>the</b> average <b>reward</b> and discounted reward by varying their weights (Krass et al. 1992).|$|R

5|$|Engaging in work or an {{assigned}} task {{can generate}} an effective distraction from a reward and enable {{a person to}} wait for a longer delay, as long as <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> is not being flaunted. Having <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.|$|E
5|$|Factors {{affecting}} one's {{ability to}} delay gratification {{depend on whether}} the delay contingency is self-imposed (delay can be terminated at {{the will of the}} person waiting) or externally imposed by another person, institution or circumstance. When the contingency is self-imposed, the physical presence of <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> seems to aid in delaying gratification. On the other hand, when the delay is externally imposed, children are not able to wait as long when <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> is present, suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|After the Scilly naval {{disaster}} of 1707 where four ships ran aground due to navigational mistakes, the British government offered a large prize of £20,000, equivalent {{to millions of}} pounds today, for anyone who could determine longitude accurately. <b>The</b> <b>reward</b> was eventually claimed in 1761 by Yorkshire carpenter John Harrison, who dedicated his life to improving the accuracy of his clocks.|$|E

5|$|The {{first story}} is about the opening of Shiva's third eye when he visits Madurai, {{the capital city of}} the Pandya Kingdom, ruled at that time by Shenbagapandian. Shenbagapandian wants to find the answer to a {{question}} posed by his wife— whether the fragrance from a woman's hair is natural or artificial— and announces a reward of 1000gold coins to anyone who can come up with the answer. A poor poet named Dharumi desperately wants <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> and starts to break down in the Meenakshi Amman Temple. Shiva, hearing his cries, {{takes the form of a}} poet and gives Dharumi a poem containing the answer. Overjoyed, Dharumi takes the poem to Shenbagapandian's court and recites it, but Nakkeerar, the court's head poet, claims the poem's meaning is incorrect. On hearing this, Shiva argues with Nakkeerar about the poem's accuracy, burning him to ashes when he refuses to relent. Later, Shiva revives Nakkeerar, and says that he only wanted to test his knowledge. Nakkeerar asks the king to give <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> to Dharumi.|$|E
5|$|Another document, {{this one}} {{preserved}} in an Irish memoranda roll {{dating to the}} reign of King Henry VI (reigned 1422–1461), records that after John's Irish expedition of 1210, Donnchadh controlled extensive territory in County Antrim, namely the settlements of Larne and Glenarm with 50 carucates of land in between, a territory similar to the later barony of Glenarm Upper. King John had given or recognised Donnchadh's possession of this territory, and that of Donnchadh's nephew Alaxandair (Alexander), {{as a reward for}} his help; similarly, John had given Donnchadh's cousins Ailean and Tómas, sons of Lochlann, a huge lordship equivalent to 140 knight's fees that included most of northern County Antrim and County Londonderry, <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> for use of their soldiers and galleys.|$|E

5|$|Cats {{have either}} a mutualistic or {{commensal}} relationship with humans. Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated. In one, people deliberately tamed cats {{in a process}} of artificial selection as they were useful predators of vermin. This has been criticized as implausible, because <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> for such an effort may have been too little; cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents, other species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests. The alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.|$|E

5|$|Naltrexone is a {{competitive}} antagonist for opioid receptors, effectively blocking {{the effects of}} endorphins and opioids. Naltrexone is used to decrease cravings for alcohol and encourage abstinence. Alcohol causes the body to release endorphins, which in turn release dopamine and activate <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> pathways; hence when naltrexone is in the body there is {{a reduction in the}} pleasurable effects from consuming alcohol. Evidence supports a reduced risk of relapse among alcohol dependent persons and a decrease in excessive drinking. Nalmefene also appears effective and works by a similar manner.|$|E
