25|$|Australians {{reacted to}} the event with {{widespread}} shock and horror, and the political effects were significant and long-lasting. The federal government led state governments, some of which (notably Tasmania itself and Queensland) were opposed to new gun laws, to severely restrict the availability of firearms. While surveys showed up to 85% of Australians 'supported gun control', many people opposed the new laws. Concern was raised within the Coalition Government that fringe {{groups such as the}} 'Ausi Freedom Scouts', the Australian League of Rights and the Citizen Initiated Referendum Party, were exploiting voter anger to gain support. After discovering that the Christian Coalition and US National Rifle Association were supporting <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>lobby,</b> the government and media cited their support, along with the moral outrage of the community to discredit <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>lobby</b> as extremists.|$|E
25|$|The {{shooting}} {{resulted in}} {{calls for more}} gun control measures. In 2000 federal and state legislation was introduced that would require safety locks on firearms as well as ban the importation of high-capacity ammunition magazines. Though laws were passed that made {{it a crime to}} buy guns for criminals and minors, there was considerable controversy over legislation pertaining to background checks at gun shows. There was concern in <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>lobby</b> over restrictions on Second Amendment rights in the US. In 2001, K-Mart, which had sold ammunition to the shooters, announced it would no longer sell handgun ammunition. This action was encouraged by the award-winning 2002 documentary Bowling for Columbine, written and directed by Michael Moore.|$|E

An avid hunter himself, his efforts agitated <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>lobby</b> and the NRA. One Maryland activist group, Citizens Against Tydings, was formed solely because of Tydings' gun registration platform. Further complicating his relations with the right were the efforts by the American Security Council Foundation, which graded him as a [...] "zero" [...] on national security issues and spent over $150,000 to campaign against his bid for re-election.|$|E

2500|$|While not {{succeeding}} in abolishing the program, {{the government did}} reform part of the registry. Among the changes made by the Conservatives to the registry, it eliminated {{within the scope of}} the registry long guns such as rifles and shotguns, a move that expected to affect up to 320,000 people. It also waived some license fees and extended registry deadlines for long gun owners. Ontario's Attorney General Michael Bryant had criticized the amnesty move in 2007 accusing Ottawa of being [...] "in the holster of <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>lobby.</b> By 2008, the federal government had refunded up to $21 million in license fees to 340 000 gun owners.|$|E

40|$|In God we trust," {{the saying}} goes, "all others bring data. " The {{free flow of}} {{information}} is central to the American idea. It fuels our economy, keeps our elected officials accountable, and guides our public policy choices. But not always. Since the 1990 s, <b>the</b> Washington <b>gun</b> <b>lobby</b> has led an aggressive effort to limit what we know about firearms. And it has largely succeeded. Americans murder each other with guns at a rate nearly 20 times higher than people in other high-income countries. Among a group of 32 comparable nations, the United States accounts for 30 percent of the population, but 90 percent of <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> homicides. Despite this epidemic, the federal government conducts almost no scientific research on how criminals get and misuse guns, or what policies are effective at stopping them. Law enforcement officials are prohibited from sharing their analyses of crime gun trace data with policymakers and the press. And military leaders and pediatricians have been barred from discussing the subject with those under their command or care.

5000|$|In the 1980s President Ronald Reagan {{sought to}} curtail scope of {{environmental}} protection taking steps such as appointing James G.

The major environmental groups responded with mass mailings which led to increased membership and donations. The large environmental organization increasingly relied on ties within Washington, D.C. to advance their environmental agenda. At the same time membership in environmental groups became more suburban and urban. Groups such as animal rights, and <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> control <b>lobby</b> became linked with environmentalism while sportsmen, farmers and ranchers were no longer influential in the movement.|$|R
50|$|Hilder was {{nominated}} in 2008 by Governor Jon M. Huntsman, Jr. {{to be appointed}} to the Utah Court of Appeals. Hilder's appointment was actively opposed by <b>the</b> Utah <b>gun</b> <b>lobby</b> because of a decision he made in a case involving {{the ability of the}} University of Utah to regulate the carrying of concealed weapons on campus. Hilder sided with the University and the legislature subsequently mooted his decision by amending the law. Although the Senate Judicial Confirmation Committee recommended confirmation on a 3-2 vote, the full Senate declined to confirm him on a 16-12 vote against confirmation. The Utah State Bar actively supported Hilder's appointment and the matter generated considerable public controversy.|$|R

50|$|During the 2010 {{election}} season, on January 10, a ban {{was implemented}} which completely prohibited citizens from carrying firearms into the public, with no exceptions.

40|$|This paper {{uses and}} expands upon the {{theoretical}} framework of political framing theory {{to analyze the}} messages {{that came out of}} different <b>gun</b> <b>lobby</b> groups during <b>the</b> early 2013 debate on gun control legislation that was being discussed within the United States Congress. My research question is what are the elements of a political action frame for a piece of legislation that can lead to positive or negative public opinion of it? To conduct my research I use a mixed-methods research approach to analyze recent political framing in regards to American gun control policy. For the qualitative part of the paper, I conduct a content analysis of both pro and anti-gun control messaging that came from <b>the</b> major <b>gun</b> <b>lobby</b> groups during <b>the</b> earlier part of 2013. For the quantitative part, I conduct a questionnaire experiment in which individuals are randomly assigned one of three potential frames, and I analyze the reception that each frame receives from participants.

40|$|This paper uses {{political}} framing {{theory to}} analyze the messages employed by different <b>gun</b> <b>lobby</b> groups during <b>the</b> early 2013 debate on gun control legislation proposed in the United States Congress. I asked two questions with my research. First, what type of political action frames did gun interest groups use {{in the debate over}} expanded background checks in the spring of 2013 ? Second, which frames affected public opinion regarding expanded background checks for gun purchases? I use a mixed-methods research approach to answer these questions. First, I conducted a content analysis of both pro- and anti-gun control messaging that came from <b>the</b> major <b>gun</b> <b>lobby</b> groups during <b>the</b> early part of 2013. Second, I conducted a survey experiment in which individuals were randomly assigned one of four potential frames, and I analyzed the effects of these frames on attitudes towards background checks. The paper finds that pro-gun control interest groups frame <b>gun</b> control in <b>the</b> context of safety and emotions, while anti-gun control groups use an anti-elite argument against expanded background checks. In addition, I find that there is high support for expanded background checks no matter which frame is presented to individuals, but using the Second Amendment in a negative framing fashion does somewhat diminish support...|$|R
50|$|A moral {{entrepreneur}} is an individual, {{group or}} formal organization {{that seeks to}} influence a group to adopt or maintain a norm. Moral entrepreneurs are those who {{take the lead in}} labeling a particular behaviour and spreading or popularizing this label throughout society. This can include attributing negative labels to behaviour as well as the removal of negative labels, positively labeling, or removing positive labels. The moral entrepreneur may press for the creation or enforcement of a norm for any number of reasons, altruistic or selfish. Such individuals or groups also hold the power to generate moral panic; similarly multiple moral entrepreneurs may have conflicting goals and work to counteract each other. Some examples of moral entrepreneurs are: MADD (mothers against drunk driving), <b>the</b> anti-tobacco <b>lobby,</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> control <b>lobby,</b> anti-pornography groups, LGBT social movements, and the pro-life and pro-choice movements (an example of two moral entrepreneurs working against each other on a single issue).|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} response from the National Rifle Association (NRA) to the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012. Specifically, the research seeks to conclude whether the NRA engaged in propaganda, and if so, what the ethical implications of such use are. Using literature from Jacques Ellul, this research outlined identifiable and objective characteristics of propaganda. The research used this propaganda lens to analyze nineteen articles from the NRA website, released {{in the months after}} the shooting. The results of the propaganda analysis indicated high levels of propaganda use throughout all nineteen articles. These findings, based on literature from scholars in the field, indicate the NRA is engaged in a highly unethical practice with regards to calling their membership into action. This research provides valuable understanding into how <b>the</b> nation’s premier <b>gun</b> <b>lobby</b> can activate millions of members into action which can potentially affect gun legislation...|$|R
40|$|As {{scholars}} puzzle {{over the}} so-called gender {{gap in the}} 1996 presidential election, we invite them to consider {{the ways in which}} communication by the Clinton campaign explicitly and implicitly told women that Clinton was a president more closely allied with their concerns than Dole.
