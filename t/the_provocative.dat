5|$|Reviews of Spec Ops: The Line {{were mostly}} positive, with many critics praising the narrative, themes, and <b>the</b> <b>provocative</b> take on {{violence}} in video games, but {{noted that it}} failed to innovate or present a strong multiplayer component. Many critics consider the game to be underrated, or overlooked.

5|$|From May 1980 {{to early}} 1981 he acted as {{editor for the}} {{magazine}} POL. In 1982, {{he moved to the}} neighbouring state of Victoria, and was appointed the Director of Tourism. This sparked an outcry in South Australia due to the two states' traditional rivalry. For his part, Dunstan said that he had yearned to be given a role in shaping and building the future of his native state, but that he had been snubbed for three years. He said that public figures in South Australia had told him that his high profile and ability to overshadow others could have caused a loss of face to them, and thus his departure would be seen favourably by them, while Victoria's offer gave him an opportunity to be constructive. Dunstan was appointed to the Victorian Economic Development Corporation on 12 July 1983, resigning on 23 June 1986. Dunstan stayed in the Director of Tourism role until 1986, when he returned to Adelaide after falling out with the government of John Cain. His retirement from these positions followed <b>the</b> <b>provocative</b> publication of a photograph of him with Monsignor Porcamadonna, member of the gay community Order of Perpetual Indulgence, taken after he had launched a collection of coming out stories by gay historian Gary Wotherspoon.|$|E

25|$|Whether <b>the</b> <b>provocative</b> acts {{or words}} and the defendant's {{response}} met the 'ordinary person' standard prescribed by the statute is the question the jury must consider, not the altogether looser question of whether, having regard to all the circumstances, the jury consider the loss of self-control was sufficient excusable.

25|$|Minstrel {{songs and}} {{sketches}} featured several stock characters, most popularly the slave and the dandy.

Minstrels claimed that their songs and dances were authentically black, although {{the extent of the}} black influence remains debated.

25|$|They {{were also}} {{famous for their}} love of nightlife, which {{attracted}} a lot of criticism, especially {{because so many of}} them had international duties with France.

25|$|When Dada reached Paris, it was avidly {{embraced by}} a group of young artists and writers who were fascinated with the {{writings}} of Sigmund Freud, particularly by his notion of the unconscious mind. <b>The</b> <b>provocative</b> spirit of Dada became linked to the exploration of the unconscious mind through the use of automatic writing, chance operations, and, in some cases, altered states. The surrealists quickly turned to painting and sculpture. The shock of unexpected elements, the use of Frottage, collage, and decalcomania, the rendering of mysterious landscapes and dreamed images were to become the key techniques {{through the rest of the}} 1930s.|$|E

In October, Anna ordered Kantakouzenos to resign his command. Kantakouzenos not only refused, but declared himself Emperor at Didymoteichon, allegedly to protect John V's rule from Kalekas.

25|$|The {{establishment}} of the new Republic of Zimbabwe in 1980 sounded the death knell for white political power and ushered {{in a new era}} of black majority rule. White emigration peaked between 1980 and 1982 at 53,000 persons, with the breakdown of law and order, an increase in crime in the rural areas, and <b>the</b> <b>provocative</b> attitude of Zimbabwean officials being cited as the main causes. Political conditions typically had a greater impact on the decision to migrate among white than black professionals. Between 1982 and 2000 Zimbabwe registered a net loss of 100,000 whites, or an average of 5,000 departures per year. A second wave of white emigration was sparked by President Robert Mugabe's violent land reform programme after 2000. Popular destinations included South Africa and Australia, which emigrants perceived to be geographically, culturally, or sociopolitically similar to their home country.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{not guilty}} verdict, the two Inuit men {{were taken to}} Calgary in late August, where they were found guilty {{of the murder of}} Le Roux.

The law at that time had a {{mandatory}} sentence of death for the crime of murder, yet the jury and the judge did not wish for the pair to die for their crimes owing to <b>the</b> <b>provocative</b> nature of the priests' actions before their deaths. To avoid the death penalty, the judge sentenced the pair to death by hanging, with the execution date set as October 15. The sentence was immediately commuted to life imprisonment at a Fort Resolution police station. In 1919, the pair assisted police in establishing a new police contingent at Tree River, and in 1922 were released.|$|E
25|$|Despite the uncongenial {{report of}} his Commission, the Malan {{government}} {{was willing to}} elevate Fagan to the Appellate Division, the country's highest court, in October 1950, to replace the departed Chief Justice Watermeyer. Concern was growing at that stage that the Nationalists were trying to fill the Appellate Division with loyalists, but in Fagan's case these concerns were, again, attenuated; despite his links with the government, he was a moderate whose appointment was justified on merit.Fagan's most significant judgments were about private law, raising little political intrigue: he established that gambling debts are unenforceable in South African law, and that undue influence vitiates a contract. But he did find against the government {{in its attempt to}} enforce the Population Registration Act, 1950, raising the standard of proof required to classify a person as 'non-European' on <b>the</b> <b>provocative</b> basis that Parliament could not have intended something so unjust as foisting that status on a person without adequate proof.|$|E
