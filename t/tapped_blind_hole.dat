50|$|Forming tap: A quite {{different}} kind of tap is a Forming Tap. A forming tap, aka a fluteless tap or roll tap, simply forcefully displaces the metal into a thread shape upon being turned into the hole, instead of cutting metal {{from the sides of}} the hole as cutting taps do. A forming tap closely resembles a cutting tap without the flutes, or very nearly just like a plain thread. There are lobes periodically spaced around the tap that actually do the thread forming as the tap is advanced into a properly sized hole. The threads behind the lobes are slightly recessed to reduce contact friction. Since the tap does not produce chips, {{there is no need to}} periodically back out the tap to clear away chips, which, in a cutting tap, can jam and break the tap. Thus thread forming is particularly suited to <b>tapping</b> <b>blind</b> <b>holes,</b> which are tougher to tap with a cutting tap due to the chip build-up in the hole. Forming taps only work in malleable materials such as mild steel or aluminum. Formed threads are typically stronger than cut threads. Note that the tap drill size differs from that used for a cutting tap as shown in most tap drill tables, and that an accurate hole size is required because a slightly undersized hole can break the tap. Proper lubrication is essential because of the frictional forces involved, therefore a lubricating oil is used instead of cutting oil.|$|R

In this instance blind may also refer to any feature that is taken to a specific depth, more specifically referring to internally threaded hole (tapped holes).

40|$|<b>Blind</b> <b>holes</b> 5 mu m in {{diameter}} and 25 mu m deep were filled with copper electrodeposited from a copper sulfate electrolyte containing chloride ions, a suppressor, and an accelerator. A thin tantalum layer was deposited {{on top of a}} copper seed layer to locally inhibit the subsequent electrodeposition of copper. A clear difference appeared {{in the evolution of the}} cathode potential recorded during the galvanostatic deposition of copper on either copper metallized flat substrates or substrates containing copper metallized recessed <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> and selectively coated with Ta at the outside. The different steps during the filling of <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> by electrolytic copper were monitored and analyzed based on the evolution of the cathode potential during electrodeposition. An electrochemical depolarization of the electrode surface induced by an accelerating species occurred first. The subsequent evolution of the potential was dominated by a change in the electrode surface that occurs during the superfilling of <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> with copper. Finally, the time to achieve a complete filling of <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> with electrolytic copper was determined.

40|$|Using {{magneto-optical}} imaging technique, we map local {{magnetic field}} distribution inside a hexagonally ordered array of <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> patterned in BSCCO single crystals. The {{nature of the}} spatial distribution of local magnetic field and shielding currents across the array reveals {{the presence of a}} non-uniform vortex configuration partially matched with the <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> at sub-matching fields. We observe that the filling fraction is different in two different regions of the array. The mean vortex configuration within the array is described as a patchy vortex configuration with the patches having different mean filling fraction. The patchy nature of the vortex configuration is more pronounced at partial filling of the array at low fields while the configuration becomes more uniform with a unique filling fraction at higher fields. The metastable nature of this patchy vortex configuration is revealed by the application of magnetic field pulses of fixed height or individual pulses of varying height to the array. The metastability of the vortex configuration allows for a relatively easy way of producing flux reorganization and flux focusing effects within the <b>blind</b> <b>hole</b> array. Effect of the magnetic field pulses modifies the vortex configuration within the array and produces a uniform enhancement in the shielding current around the patterned array edges. The enhanced shielding current concentrates magnetic flux within the array by driving vortices away from the edges and towards the center of the array. The enhanced shielding current also prevents the uninhibited entry of vortices into the array. We propose that the metastable patchy vortex configuration within the <b>blind</b> <b>hole</b> array is due to a non-uniform pinning landscape leading to non-uniform filling of individual <b>blind</b> <b>holes.</b> Comment: 15 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
