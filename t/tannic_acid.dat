5|$|Cannon {{recovered}} from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water; because of this, electrolytic reduction treatment is required to forestall the process of corrosion. The cannon is then washed in deionized water to remove the electrolyte, and is treated in <b>tannic</b> <b>acid,</b> which prevents further rust and gives the metal a bluish-black colour. After this process, cannons on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a wax sealant. A coat of polyurethane may also be painted over the wax sealant, to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting dust in outdoor displays.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 the Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association {{was founded}} to promote {{conservation}} in the region. One of the association's initial concerns was the acidification of streams, which they originally attributed to <b>tannic</b> <b>acid</b> {{from the trees}} used by the beavers to construct their dams. With the assistance of Pennsylvania's Department of Forests and Waters, Game Commission, and Fish and Boat Commission, they dynamited 79 dams. Afterward, they discovered the water was acidic upstream of the dams too, and eventually realized that the problem was caused by acid rain, not the beavers. The association has operated several stations to reduce the acidity of Mosquito Creek and its tributaries, with technical assistance from the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State).|$|E

25|$|Plant {{thiamine}} antagonists are heat-stable and {{occur as}} both the ortho- and para-hydroxyphenols. Some examples of these antagonists are caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and <b>tannic</b> <b>acid.</b> These compounds interact with the thiamine to oxidize the thiazole ring, thus rendering it unable to be absorbed. Two flavonoids, quercetin and rutin, have also been implicated as thiamine antagonists.|$|E
50|$|Iron gall ink (also {{known as}} iron gall nut ink, oak gall ink, and common ink) is a purple-black or brown-black ink made from iron salts and <b>tannic</b> <b>acids</b> from {{vegetable}} sources.

This may result from alternations of pharmacokinetic behavior of aconitine in the animals due to the pharmacokinetic interaction between aconitine and paeoniflorin. In addition, in emergencies, one can wash the stomach using either <b>tannic</b> <b>acid</b> or powdered charcoal. Heart stimulants such as strong coffee or caffeine may also help until professional help is available.|$|E
25|$|Chestnut was {{the most}} popular wood since its logs could be used to build cabins and rail fences to protect crops from wild animals. It could easily be split into {{shingles}} for roofs to cover cabins and barns. Its bark was used to make medicine and <b>tannic</b> <b>acid</b> for tanning and dyeing. In the fall, its rich nuts were used to fatten razorback hogs for the market and the home. Hemlock was also highly valued for its many uses.|$|E
25|$|Coast redwoods are {{resistant}} to insect attack, fungal infection, and rot. These properties are conferred by concentrations of terpenoids and <b>tannic</b> <b>acid</b> in redwood leaves, roots, bark, and wood. Despite these chemical defenses, redwoods are still subject to insect infestations; none, however, are capable of killing a healthy tree. Redwoods also face predation from mammals: black bears are reported to consume the inner bark of small redwoods, and black-tailed deer are known to eat redwood sprouts.|$|E
50|$|Gall-nuts {{were also}} used for making fine black writing ink.

Similar kaolin ingestion is also widespread in parts of Africa. Such practices may stem from health benefits such as the ability of clay to absorb plant toxins and protect against toxic alkaloids and <b>tannic</b> <b>acids.</b>|$|R
40|$|Organic {{compounds}} {{are capable}} of repelling motile bacteria from marine surfaces. The most effective compounds were acrylamide and benzoic and <b>tannic</b> <b>acids.</b> These were active at concentrations that were not toxic to the bacteria. Repellents were incorporated in nontoxic paints and applied to metal panels. Treated panels immersed in seawater developed a bacterial film of only 10 (6) bacteria per cm 6 after 12 days compared with untreated panels, which had 5 times 10 (12) bacteria per cm 2 after the same period.

Cationic polyelectrolytes are at pH values above the pI. It {{is important to note}} that an excess of polyelectrolytes will cause the precipitate to dissolve back into the solution. An example of polyelectrolyte flocculation is the removal of protein cloud from beer wort using Irish moss.|$|E
25|$|The galls contain {{large amounts}} of <b>tannic</b> <b>acid,</b> which was used for making iron gall ink and for dyeing cloth. According to recent research, traces of iron-gall ink have been found on the Dead Sea scrolls and on the 'lost' Gospel of Judas. Iron-gall ink {{may have been used}} for 1,800 years, but it does not {{withstand}} the test of time well. Over the course of centuries, the ink fades, and discolours and damages the paper. Other waterproof formulae, better suited for writing on paper, became available in the 20th century. Iron gall ink is manufactured chiefly by artists enthusiastic about reviving old methods or possibly forgers of old documents.|$|E

40|$|An amplified {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (A-ELISA) {{for detecting}} and quantifying hepatitis A virus in estuarine water samples is described. The test was five times more sensitive than a standard ELISA {{and at least two}} times more sensitive than radioimmunoassay. Test sensitivity was unaffected by the procedures used to concentrate the virus in estuarine samples or by the presence of humic and <b>tannic</b> <b>acids</b> in test samples. Nonspecific reactions were not encountered with a number of enteroviruses or with a rotavirus. A high sensitivity and specificity combined with speed, low cost, and freedom from radiolabels made the A-ELISA useful for detecting hepatitis A virus in environmental samples.

40|$|Meloidogyne spp. incite root-knot {{disease in}} the roots of Solanaceous and Cereal crop plants inflicting heavy damage to the crops. M. graminicola, a root-knot {{nematode}} is ubiquitous as a rice pathogen wherever rice is grown. High Performance Liquid Chromatographic (HPLC) analysis of phenolic acids in healthy and root-knot infected plant parts of rice indicated that phenolic acid contents were highly variable in both the cases. Upper leaves of healthy plants had seven phenolic acids in which gallic acid was maximum (140. 3 μg/g fresh wt) followed by ferulic, <b>tannic</b> and vanillic <b>acids.</b> However, in root knot-infected plants, upper leaves had six phenolic acids in which gallic acid was maximum (190. 68 μg) followed by caffeic, ferulic, o-coumeric, cinnamic and salicylic acids. In healthy leaf sheath gallic acid was the maximum (8. 6 μg) followed by tannic, ferulic, vanillic, caffeic acid but o-coumeric, cinnamic and Indole Acetic Acid (IAA) were detected in traces. Root knot-infected leaf sheath had nine phenolic acids, where gallic was the maximum (26. 84 μg) followed by vanillic, ferulic, o-coumeric and <b>tannic</b> <b>acids</b> but other phenolic acids, viz., cinnamic, salicylic and IAA were present in traces. Roots of healthy rice plants had seven phenolic acids while infected roots had nine phenolic acids. Moreover, in infected roots without root-knot had eight phenolic acids, in which gallic was the maximum (29. 30 μg) followed by ferulic, caffeic, vanillic, <b>tannic</b> and o-coumeric <b>acids</b> but salicylic and IAA were present in traces...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the water}} {{constituents}} {{that has not been}} investigated in great detail for potential detrimental effect on mineral flotation is organic matter. This study investigates the effect of natural organic materials contained in water, such as humic, fulvic and <b>tannic</b> <b>acids,</b> on the flotation of copper and molybdenum sulphides in alkaline conditions and in concentrations similar to those found in natural waters. Results show that copper and molybdenum grades decreased with the addition of humic, <b>tannic</b> and fulvic <b>acid</b> in that order, with a larger depression of molybdenite grade and recovery. Adsorption studies using ultraviolet (UV) -visible spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) surface analysis confirmed that these organic materials were adsorbed on the minerals surface. Complimentary analyses of froth characteristics, particle size distribution and fine particles entrainment were also conducted to explain the cause of the negative effect of these organic materials on flotation. The flotation results were explained in terms of the decrease in the hydrophobicity of the mineral surfaces due to the adsorption of hydrophilic groups in these organic materials which then prevent bubble-particle adhesion. The larger detrimental effect of humic acid is due to its higher adsorption on the minerals, high molecular weight and carbon content compared with the other organic acids used...|$|R
50|$|Bog ore is a {{renewable}} resource when mined and utilized with care. It is produced when rain water leaches out humic and <b>tannic</b> <b>acids</b> and reacts with carbon dioxide, which is produced {{as a part}} of the natural life-cycle of microorganisms in the soil. Part of this leachate consists of iron particles from deeper in the soil. As the water passes through these areas of loamy soil, also called marl, it deposits a solution of iron carbonate which rises up to the surface. This iron carbonate then combines with the surface soil and, over time, hardens into a solid mass. This process only takes about 25 to 35 years, making it an ideal, almost perpetual resource for industry but only if treated with respect. If the ore bed is left undeveloped and unpolluted, the beds can be mined indefinitely farther south in New Jersey. The operators of furnaces were forced to purchase ore from Staten Island, New York, because the ore beds had been over-mined.|$|R
2500|$|The F-actin polymer is {{considered}} to have structural polarity {{due to the fact}} that all the microfilament’s subunits point towards the same end.

[...] The terms [...] "pointed" [...] and [...] "barbed" [...] referring to the two ends of the microfilaments derive from their appearance under transmission electron microscopy when samples are examined following a preparation technique called [...] "decoration". This method consists of the addition of myosin S1 fragments to tissue that has been fixed with <b>tannic</b> <b>acid.</b> This myosin forms polar bonds with actin monomers, giving rise to a configuration that looks like arrows with feather fletchings along its shaft, where the shaft is the actin and the fletchings are the myosin.
