As Health Minister, Dosanjh strongly supported Canada's existing single-tier, publicly funded health-care system. Dosanjh introduced legislation to make cigarettes fire safe, new regulations to further limit lead content in children's jewelry, and supported an NDP motion to ban trans fats. He advocated that Canada ratify the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which they did in November 2004. Dosanjh funded a program to revise the Canada food guide to include more multicultural foods and another program to integrate foreign-trained medical professionals into <b>the</b> <b>health-care</b> <b>system.</b> Supported by a unanimous vote in the House of Commons, the government agreed to compensate the 6,000 Canadians infected with hepatitis C from tainted blood transfusion. Along with Prime Minister Martin, a 10-year, $41 billion funding plan was negotiated with the provinces to deliver health care – with $5.5 billion to specifically address wait times that had been an election issue during the 2004 federal election – but they rejected Premiers' demands for a national program to purchase pharmaceuticals in bulk. As the Minister of Health, Dosanjh introduced Bill C-12 An Act to prevent the introduction and spread of communicable diseases which updated the 1985 Quarantine Act; it was given royal assent in May 2005.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{women may}} take {{a greater role in}} {{providing}} for the family financially, this does not always mean that men take on a greater share of the housework. Studies on Taiwanese and Korean immigrants in New York found that the distribution of household labor in the home varied with class. In general, husbands in families belonging to the professional class were more likely to take on household work than in those belonging to the working class. Among Chicano families belonging to the professional class, a study found that husbands took on an even greater share of the household labor when compared to professional-class families from other ethnic groups. These studies found, however, that even among immigrant families in the professional class, wives still did the bulk of the work. Among many Vietnamese immigrant families, reproductive labor is still seen as the responsibility of women. In the United States, the scope of this household work is expanded to include dealing with larger institutions like schools, utility companies, and <b>the</b> <b>health-care</b> <b>system.</b> Women may also take over the task of finding housing and dealing with landlords. Language barriers and the threat of feeling powerless may lead men to avoid interactions with such bureaucracies, leaving the job of navigating these complex systems to women. This results in women having superior knowledge of the workings of such systems. Among Vietnamese immigrants, women are often thought of as experts on health-care, and men may defer to women since they have more knowledge of how <b>the</b> <b>health-care</b> <b>system</b> operates. In the case of Vietnamese immigrants, although women were still expected to take responsibility for a disproportionate amount of household-related labor, the change in the nature of such labor gives them the skills and the confidence to {{know how to deal with}} societal institutions. [...] This knowledge provides women with a certain amount of leverage within the household and provides them with a greater amount of social and cultural capital relative to men.|$|E
2500|$|Subsidized by the Dutch government, the [...] "Long Live Love" [...] package (Lang leve de liefde), {{developed}} in the late 1980s, aims to give teenagers the skills {{to make their own}} decisions regarding health and sexuality. Nearly all secondary schools provide sex education, as part of biology classes and over half of primary schools discuss sexuality and contraception. Starting the 2012 school year, age-appropriate sex education—including education about sexual diversity —will be compulsory in all secondary and primary schools. The curriculum focuses on biological aspects of reproduction as well as on values, attitudes, communication and negotiation skills. Dutch sex education encourages the idea that topics like masturbation, homosexuality, and sexual pleasure are normal or natural and that there are larger emotional, relational, and societal forces that shape the experiences of sexuality. Moreover, according to Amy Schalet Dutch parents tend to form close relationships with their children, openly discussing teen sexuality. Dutch parents try to accept their children's romantic relationships and even allow sleepovers, expecting them to have sex. The media has encouraged open dialogue and <b>the</b> <b>health-care</b> <b>system</b> guarantees confidentiality and a non-judgmental approach. The Netherlands has one of the lowest teenage pregnancy rates in the world, and the Dutch approach is often seen as a model for other countries.|$|E

40|$|Background: Health-care {{financing}} {{should be}} equitable. In {{many developing countries}} such as Kenya, changes to <b>health-care</b> financing <b>systems</b> are being implemented {{as a means of}} providing equitable access to health care with the aim of attaining universal coverage. Vertical equity means that people of dissimilar ability to pay make dissimilar levels of contribution to <b>the</b> <b>health-care</b> financing <b>system.</b> Vertical equity can be analysed by measuring progressivity. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse progressivity by measuring deviations from proportionality in the relationship between sources of health-care financing and ability to pay using Kakwani indices applied to data from the Kenya Household Health Utilisation and Expenditure Survey 2007. Methods: Concentration indices and Kakwani indices were obtained for <b>the</b> sources of <b>health-care</b> financing: direct and indirect taxes, out of pocket (OOP) payments, private insurance contributions and contributions to the National Hospital Insurance Fund. The bootstrap method was used to analyse the sensitivity of the Kakwani index to changes in the equivalence scale or the use of an alternative measure of ability to pay. Results: <b>The</b> overall <b>health-care</b> financing <b>system</b> was regressive. Out of pocket payments were regressive with all other payments being proportional. Direct taxes, indirect taxes and private insurance premiums were sensitive to the use of income as an alternative measure of ability to pay. However, the overall finding of a regressive <b>health-care</b> <b>system</b> remained. Conclusion: Reforms to <b>the</b> Kenyan <b>health-care</b> financing <b>system</b> are required to reduce dependence on out of pocket payments. The bootstrap method can be used in determining the sensitivity of the Kakwani index to various assumptions made in the analysis. Further analyses are required to determine <b>the</b> equity of <b>health-care</b> utilization and <b>the</b> effect of proposed reforms on overall equity of <b>the</b> Kenyan <b>health-care</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
