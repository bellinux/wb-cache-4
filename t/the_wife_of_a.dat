5|$|Jovovich played Lucetta, <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> jailed {{arsonist}} (played by Edward Norton) in Stone, {{a psychological}} thriller starring Robert De Niro. Filming began in May 2009 at the recently closed Southern Michigan Correctional Facility in Jackson, Michigan.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 1759, Washington married wealthy widow Martha Dandridge Custis, then 28 years old. Surviving letters {{suggest that}} he may have been in love at the time with Sally Fairfax, <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> friend. Nevertheless, George and Martha made a {{compatible}} marriage, because Martha was intelligent, gracious, and experienced in managing a planter's estate.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata in Weimar, but the composition history is complicated {{and not at}} all stages certain. Findings by Martin Petzoldt suggest that the cantata began with the later movements 2–6 and 9, most of them on biblical text, performed at a memorial service of Aemilia Maria Haress, <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> former prime-minister of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, at the church St. Peter und Paul in Weimar on 8 October 1713. Bach may then have expanded it and presented it for his application in December 1713 at the Liebfrauenkirche in Halle. The performance material of this event, the only surviving source, shows on the title page the designation , indicating that the cantata with its general readings and texts is suitable for any occasion.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, {{a number of}} those convicted for collaborating with the Nazi {{occupiers}} were freed from prison. Sympathetic to their plight, Hergé lent money to some and aided others in getting jobs at Tintin magazine, much to Leblanc's annoyance. For instance, as well as lending him money, Hergé used his connections to secure Raymond de Becker a job in Switzerland as a book shop sales inspector. He also hired those associated with collaboration for his Studios; his new colourist, Josette Baujot, was <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> recently assassinated member of the Walloon Legion, and his new secretary, Baudouin van der Branden de Reeth, had served a prison sentence for working at Le Nouveau Journal during the occupation.|$|E
5|$|In {{its earlier}} years, the studio did not {{hesitate}} to take advantage of scandal sheet–worthy events. After the death of celebrated Paramount actor Wallace Reid, brought on by morphine addiction, his widow, Dorothy Davenport, signed on as producer and star of a cinematic examination of the sins of substance abuse: Human Wreckage, released by FBO in June 1923, five months after Reid's death, featured Davenport (billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid) as <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> noble attorney turned dope fiend.|$|E

5|$|In late 1992 Takanohana {{announced}} his engagement to actress Rie Miyazawa, news which sparked a similar amount of coverage {{to the royal}} wedding held that year. However the engagement was broken off the following year, reportedly because Miyazawa was seen by Takanohana's parents and the Sumo Association as being unwilling to sacrifice her career to become a regular stable wife. The role of <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> head coach in looking after the stable's recruits and liaising with supporter's groups {{is regarded as a}} full-time job.|$|E
5|$|In spring 1881, Marcus found Behan in {{bed with}} <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> friend and kicked him out, {{although}} she still used the Behan surname {{through the end of}} that summer. Earp had a common-law relationship with Mattie Blaylock, who was listed as his wife in the June 1880 census. She suffered from severe headaches and became addicted to laudanum, a commonly used opiate and painkiller. There are no contemporary records in Tombstone of a relationship between Josephine and Earp. Tombstone diarist George W. Parsons never mentioned seeing Wyatt and Josephine together and neither did John Clum in his memoirs. But Earp and Marcus certainly knew each other, as Behan and Earp both had offices above the Crystal Palace Saloon.|$|E
5|$|In the {{production}} of his The Brigand, Planché created tableaux vivants of three recent paintings by Charles Eastlake: An Italian Brigand Chief Reposing, <b>The</b> <b>Wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Brigand Chief Watching the Result of a Battle, and The Dying Brigand. This feature was a success and widely copied. Paintings inspired his work {{in a number of}} other plays. For The Golden Branch (1847) and Love and Fortune (1859), he created costumes based on the paintings of Watteau. The latter play, which was subtitled A Dramatic Tableau (in Watteau Colours), also included a tableau from Watteau's Noces de Village.|$|E

5|$|Katherine Hewitt (a.k.a. Mould-Heeles) {{was charged}} and {{found guilty of}} the murder of Anne Foulds. She was <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> clothier from Colne, and had {{attended}} the meeting at Malkin Tower with Alice Grey. According to the evidence given by James Device, both Hewitt and Grey told the others at that meeting that they had killed a child from Colne, Anne Foulds. Jennet Device also picked Katherine out of a line-up, and confirmed her attendance at the Malkin Tower meeting.|$|E
5|$|Mme. Hulot's cousin, Bette (also called Lisbeth), harbors a deep but hidden {{resentment of}} her relatives' success. A peasant woman {{with none of}} the {{physical}} beauty of her cousin, Bette has rejected a series of marriage proposals from middle-class suitors, and remains unmarried at the age of 42. One day she comes upon a young unsuccessful Polish sculptor named Wenceslas Steinbock, attempting suicide in the tiny apartment upstairs from her own. As she nourishes him back to health, she develops a maternal fondness for him. She also befriends Valérie, <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> War Department clerk named Marneffe; the two women form a bond of mutual affection and protection.|$|E
5|$|The Tarakeswar affair (also {{known as}} the Tarakeswar scandal or the Mahant-Elokeshi affair) refers to a public scandal in 19th-century Bengal during the British Raj. It {{resulted}} from an illicit love affair between Elokeshi, <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> government employee Nobin Chandra, and the Brahmin head priest (or mahant) of the Tarakeswar Shiva temple. Nobin subsequently decapitated his wife Elokeshi because of the love affair. A highly publicised trial followed, dubbed the Tarakeswar murder case of 1873, in which both the husband and the mahant were found guilty in varying degrees.|$|E
50|$|Derinda Township {{was named}} in the 1850s for Derinda Barr, <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> early settler.|$|R
50|$|A {{few years}} later she became one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rival warlord, Dobromir Chrysos.|$|R

5|$|The Western Ganga {{society in}} many ways {{reflected}} the emerging religious, political and cultural developments of those times. Women became active in local administration because Ganga kings distributed territorial responsibility to their queens such as the feudal queen Parabbaya-arasi of Kundattur and the queens of King Sripurusha, Butuga II and feudal king Permadi. Inheritance of fiscal and administrative responsibility by the son-in-law, the wife or by the daughter is evident. The position of prime minister of King Ereganga II and position of nalgavunda (local landlord) bestowed upon Jakkiabbe, <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fallen hero are examples. When Jakkiabbe took to asceticism, her daughter inherited the position.|$|E
5|$|The massive {{influx of}} prospectors drove the {{formation}} of boom towns along the routes of the stampede, with Dawson City in the Klondike the largest. The new towns were crowded, often chaotic and many disappeared {{just as soon as}} they came. Most stampeders were men but women also travelled to the region, typically as <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prospector. Some women entertained in gambling and dance halls built by business men and women who were encouraged by the lavish spending of successful miners.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} however has to {{be considered}} {{on the basis of}} the fact that, for reasons which are readily understandable, he with the express approval of His Majesty enjoys this title and has been referred to as a Royal Highness on a formal occasion and in formal documents. In the light of precedent it seems clear that <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Royal Highness enjoys the same title unless some appropriate express step can be and is taken to deprive her of it.|$|E
50|$|Elizabeth Township was {{organized}} in 1870, and named for Elizabeth Niggler, <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> early settler.|$|R

5|$|The senator {{alleged that}} Stevenson had downplayed {{the threat of}} communism, and was thus unfit to be president. He affirmed that Eisenhower was the only man fit {{to lead the country}} in ridding the {{government}} of corruption and communism. Reading parts of a letter from <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> serviceman fighting in the Korean War, who, despite her financial woes, had scraped together $10 to donate to the campaign, Nixon promised that he would never cash that check.|$|E
5|$|The series follows Shawn Spencer (James Roday) and his {{colleague}} and best friend Gus (Dulé Hill), who claim to operate a psychic detective agency. It is actually based on Shawn's hyperobservant ability. In the episode, <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dead bank robber is brought {{to the police station}} to be warned that her husband's partners are being released from prison. She hires Shawn and Gus to help her find the money that was stolen and never found. Shawn and Gus search for the money, and find that the husband was not actually dead. Shawn realizes where the money is, and tells the woman, who he later discovers is actually the criminal mastermind. Detective Carlton Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) arrests the woman, and Shawn finds the money.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt Earp and Cochise County sheriff Johnny Behan were {{interested}} in the same sheriff's position and also may have shared an interest in the same woman, Josephine Marcus, known as Sadie. Citizens of Tombstone believed that Behan and Marcus were married, but Behan was a known womanizer and had sex with prostitutes and other women. Marcus ended the relationship after she came home and found Behan in bed with <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> friend and kicked him out, although she used the Behan surname through the end of that summer. She rented her home sometime before April 1881 to a doctor, George Goodfellow.|$|E
