5|$|A {{number of}} artists visited the newly {{returned}} Trafalgar ships, including John Livesay, drawing master at the Royal Naval Academy. Livesay produced several sketches of battle-damaged ships, {{sending them to}} Nicholas Pocock {{to be used for}} Pocock's large paintings of the battle. Temeraire was one of the ships he sketched. Another visitor to Portsmouth was J. M. W. Turner. It is not known whether he visited Temeraire, though he did go aboard Victory, making preparatory notes and sketches and interviewing sailors {{who had been in the}} battle. The story of the Temeraire had become firmly ingrained in the public mind, so much so that when the House of Commons passed a vote of thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had fought at Trafalgar, only three were specifically named. Nelson, Collingwood, and Harvey of the Temeraire.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war in 1861, Johnston was fifteen years old and {{attending}} Highland Military College in Newburg, New York. He remained in school through 1862, but then left to raise a company for a regiment being organized in New York. De Peyster's father paid ten-dollar bounties <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> signed the muster roll of his company. He was not able to assume command because of his age, and his family also felt he was too young for service. However, in the winter of 1863, he threatened to travel to Washington, D.C. and stand for examination for an officership with a colored regiment.|$|E

5|$|In al-Karak, an-Nasir Ahmad had Tashtamur and Qutlubugha {{executed}} for unclear reasons. The move to execute them appalled the public, with whom an-Nasir Ahmad was steadily losing credibility with. The executions {{were seen as}} a testament of an-Nasir Ahmad's ingratitude <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had supported him and virtually installed him as sultan. Historian Joseph Drory argues {{that it was because}} Tashtamur and Qutlubugha compelled him to assume the sultanate and remove him from his self-imposed isolation in al-Karak that made an-Nasir Ahmad resentful toward them.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jasjit enters De Silva's {{apartment}} {{to wait for}} him and finds the disc. He receives a phone call saying that if he wants to see his son again, he will have to bring the disc <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> are holding Deepu hostage. When he meets them, he learns that DeSilva has been alive all along and is actually Vardhan, who was using Vijay to get close to his competitor. Later, Jasjit engage in a combat with Vijay but Deepu interrupts him, telling him about Vijay, who has been his guardian in Jasjit's absence. Jasjit teams up with Vijay and Roma and shares information about Vardhan's real identity. They come up with a plan. Jasjit arranges a meeting with Vardhan, but the trio have informed the Interpol.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, 1861, President Lincoln {{issued an}} Executive Order calling for 75,000 ninety-day enlistments to “repossess the forts, places, and {{property}} {{which have been}} seized from the Union.’’ That day, Lincoln wrote Ellsworth asking for his assistance in raising a regiment. Ellsworth had known the president well, from having assisted in organizing his campaign for the presidency in 1860 and received a commission to organize the 11th New York Infantry as a 90-day regiment. To the enlistees, a common yet often unknown stipulation included 90days {{of service to the}} Federal government and up to two years of service to the state. This was not always communicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> enlisted, including those of the 11th New York.|$|E

25|$|Mujib's death plunged {{the nation}} into {{many years of}} {{political}} turmoil. The coup leaders were soon overthrown {{and a series of}} counter-coups and political assassinations paralyzed the country. Order was largely restored after a coup in 1977 gave control to the army chief Ziaur Rahman. Declaring himself President in 1978, Ziaur Rahman signed the Indemnity Ordinance, giving immunity from prosecution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> plotted Mujib's assassination and overthrow.|$|E
25|$|In 1856, the Texas Veterans Association began {{lobbying}} {{the state}} legislature to create a memorial <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> died during the Texas Revolution. The legislature made no efforts to commemorate the final battle of the revolution until the 1890s, when funds were finally appropriated to purchase the land where the Battle of San Jacinto took place. After a careful survey to determine {{the boundaries of the}} original battle site, land was purchased for a new state park east of Houston, in 1897. This became San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site.|$|E

The discovery sparked an outcry among citizens in Murmansk and they demanded it be turned into a memorial <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> died. After considerable difficulty, the memorial was finally completed and dedicated on Sunday, 26 July 2009, Russia's Navy Day, in the submarine's home port, the Vidyayevo naval base.

25|$|The {{direction}} of the boy's upbringing was entirely {{in the hands of}} his grandmother, the empress Catherine II. As in the case of her eldest grandson (afterwards the emperor Alexander I), she regulated every detail of his physical and mental education; but in accordance with her usual custom, she left the carrying out of her views <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> were in her confidence. Count Nikolai Saltykov {{was supposed to be the}} actual tutor, but he too in his turn transferred the burden to another, interfering personally only on exceptional occasions, and exercised no influence upon the character of the passionate, restless and headstrong boy. The only person who exerted a responsible influence was Cesar La Harpe, who was tutor-in-chief from 1783 to May 1795 and educated both the empress's grandsons.|$|E

25|$|Even though Sandridge had {{no formal}} {{training}} or art education, his intuitively unique style and hand painted talent of billboards {{caught the attention}} of The Coca-Cola Company in the early 1970s. Working for an outdoor sign company, Sandridge painted a realistically, eye-catching image of Niagara Falls featuring the iconic Coca-Cola bottle and logo design on a 14ft x 48ft billboard. So popular was the sight that the billboard won an award, prompting representatives from The Coca-Cola Company to drive from Atlanta, Georgia, to Gadsden, Alabama, to preview Sandridge's artwork. Feeling proud of the attention his craftsmanship had attracted, Sandridge recognized that the weight of the adverse racial overtones of the time would not allow him the recognition he deserved. He was not even given a formal introduction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> were captivated by his work. But not one to sit idly by and accept racism or tolerate blatant disrespect towards his work ethic and creative abilities, he soon left that company.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{arrived to}} a deserted island, {{and began to}} follow their orders to fortify Alderney as part of Hitler's Atlantic Wall. In January 1942 they built four camps in Alderney: two work camps, Lager Helgoland and Lager Borkum, and two {{concentration}} camps, Lager Sylt and Lager Norderney. They were built by the Nazi Organisation Todt (OT) to house the labour used to build fortifications including bunkers, gun emplacements, tunnels, air-raid shelters and other concrete and field fortifications. Lager Norderney, containing Russian and Polish POWs, and the Lager Sylt camp holding Jewish slave labourers, were transferred to SS administration in March 1943 {{under the control of}} Hauptsturmführer Maximilian List. There are 397 graves in Alderney, which when added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> died in ships, takes the total to over 700 out of a total inmate population of 6,000 who lost their lives before the camps were closed and the remaining inmates transferred to France in 1944. On the return to their island, Alderney evacuees had little or no knowledge of the crimes committed on their island during the occupation, because by December 1945, the first date civilians could return home, all the slave labourers had been sent away and the majority of the German troops left behind were not senior staff. Evidence, however, was all over the island, with concrete fortifications and graveyards for the prisoners kept there during the occupation.|$|E

500|$|With {{the support}} of his mentor Michael Maestlin, Kepler {{received}} permission from the Tübingen university senate to publish his manuscript, pending removal of the Bible exegesis and the addition of a simpler, more understandable description of the Copernican system as well as Kepler's new ideas. [...] Mysterium was published late in 1596, and Kepler received his copies and began sending them to prominent astronomers and patrons early in 1597; it was not widely read, but it established Kepler's reputation as a highly skilled astronomer. The effusive dedication, to powerful patrons as well as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> controlled his position in Graz, also provided a crucial doorway into the patronage system.|$|E
500|$|In 1903, Poundstone's designs began {{receiving}} {{attention from}} American naval authorities. After being refined by Washington Irving Chambers, Poundstone's work {{was brought to}} the Naval War College, where it was tested in war games during the 1903 Newport Conference. The results indicated that a theoretical battleship that dispensed with the intermediate 8- and 7-inch armament and was armed with only twelve 11- or 12-inch guns, all able to fire on a single broadside, was worth three of the battleships then in service. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> conducted the tests, the main reasoning for the finding was that the measure of effective gun ranges was directly related to the maximum length of an enemy's torpedo range. At this time, the latter was roughly at that distance, the 7- and 8-inch guns common to American intermediate batteries {{would not be able to}} penetrate the armor of enemy battleships. Worse still, it was certain that—as the United States was developing a [...] torpedo—gun range would have to rise in the near future, making the intermediate guns even less useful. However, a homogeneous main battery of 11- or 12-inch guns would be able to penetrate the armor and have sufficient explosive power to disable an enemy capital ship, and adding as many [...] guns as possible would provide a strong defense against torpedo-carrying but unarmored destroyers.|$|E
