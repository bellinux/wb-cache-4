40|$|The design {{philosophy}} and measurements performed {{on a new}} roller-gear transmission prototype for a robotic manipulator are described. The design incorporates smooth rollers in a planetary configuration integrated with conventional toothed gears. The rollers were designed to handle low torque with low backlash and friction while the complementary gears support higher torques and prevent accumulated creep or slip of the rollers. The introduction of gears with finite numbers of teeth to function in parallel with the rollers imposes severe limits on available designs. Solutions for two-planet row designs are discussed. A two-planet row, four-planet design was conceived, fabricated, and tested. Detailed calculations of cluster geometry, gear stresses, and gear geometry are given. Measurement data reported here include <b>transmission</b> <b>linearity,</b> static and dynamic friction, inertia, backlash, stiffness, and forward and reverse efficiency. Initial test results are reported describing performance of the transmission in a servomechanism with torque feedback...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{implementation}} {{in a digital}} signal processor (DSP or FPGA) of a Digital Adaptive Predistorter (DAPD) for power amplifier (PA) linearization based on a Nonlinear Autoregressive Moving Average (NARMA) structure. The distinctive characteristic of this DAPD is its straightforward deduction from the NARMA PA model, without the need of using an indirect learning approach to identify the DAPD function. The DAPD itself presents a NARMA structure, and hence it can be quickly implemented by means of Look-Up Tables (LUTs). WCDMA modulated signals, collected from a 3 -stage LDMOS class-AB power amplifier, with a {{maximum output power of}} 48 dBm CW have been used to validate the linearizer performance. The developed DSP and FPGA based platform for prototyping digital predistortion linearizers eases the process of meeting <b>transmission</b> <b>linearity</b> requirements, depending of the degree of impairments added by the transmitter chain, and enables a quick migration between different DAPD schemes. Details on the internal DAPD organization and abilities are provided, giving an insight on actual development scenarios of predistorter systems considering memory effects. Experimental results obtained from the linearization of a 10 W class-AB LDMOS amplifier (2 GHz band) are provided...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{demonstrate}} energy-efficient low-complexity adaptive linearization for wideband handset {{power amplifiers}} (PAs). Due to power overhead and complexity, traditional wideband linearization {{techniques such as}} adaptive digital predistortion (DPD) thus far have not been used for wideband handset transmitters. Our energy-efficient lookup table training strategy resulted in a training energy of 1. 83 nJ/entry for a 5 -MHz bandwidth WiMAX orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) transmission, which represents more than 40 improvement over state-of-the-art DPD implementations. Our experimental prototype transmitter achieves a maximum of 9. 9 -dB improvement of adjacent channel leakage power at 5. 15 -MHz offset with 22. 0 -dBm channel power in the 5 -MHz bandwidth WiMAX-OFDMA <b>transmission.</b> This <b>linearity</b> improvement offers 26. 5 % savings in PA power consumption by reducing power backoff.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made in CMOS RF-switches {{that can be used in}} the {{front-end}} of a multi-band radio targeting the 802. 11 a,b,g and W-CDMA standards and working in the frequency range 2. 4 - 5. 5 GHz. Especially, one single-transistor switch and two types of transmission gates have been analyzed, simulated and compared with respect to loss, linearity, compression point and noise. From this, five different single-transistor switches have been designed for on-chip probing measurements. Special consideration has been taken to accommodate on-chip testing, thus additional structures have been designed. The simulations and design has been performed with Chartered 0. 18 um RF-CMOS process. The results from the simulations show that the single-transistor switch has better performance in loss, linearity, compression point and noise compared to the transmission gates. However, for the <b>transmission</b> gates the <b>linearity</b> can be increased beyond the linearity of the single-transistor switch if the widths of the transistors are made sufficiently large. For the single-transistor switch, simulation results show that the transistor length shall be kept to its minimum for best performance and that the number of fingers does not influence significantly. Also, there are optimum values for the loss in on-mode, the noise and the linearity and worst-case values for the loss in off-mode when the transistor width is varied. Consequently, the single- transistor switch can be tuned by its transistor width to accommodate desired performances...|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{communication}} {{is a form}} of communication that has been around for over hundreds of years and is the fastest growing segment of the communication industry. Today, wireless communication has become an essential part of almost everyone’s daily life, and the number of users has increased exponentially over the last decade with the introduction of the internet, mobile devices and smart phones. Radio Frequency (RF) transmission is arguably the most popular method of communication and is available worldwide. With the rapid progress in technology and the increase of number of users, the limited RF spectrum is becoming more congested which led to numerous research efforts to find an alternative that can help to alleviate the pending problem. One of the proposed solutions is Visible Light Communication (VLC), which uses visible Light Emitting Diode (LED) for data transmission. In this thesis, three integrated microLED/Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) Integrated Circuits (ICs) are presented with the main aim of increasing the data rate of transmission. The first microLED/CMOS IC presented here is the Generation V microLED/CMOS driver which represents the continuation of the earlier work in the HYPIX project, which aimed to develop a microLED/CMOS driver to optically pump an organic polymer laser. A 40 x 10 pixelarray of Generation V microLED/CMOS driver was thus designed, primarily for optical pumping polymer lasing purposes, but has also demonstrated the ability to perform communication transmission using an On-Off Keying (OOK) modulation scheme. The driver consumes up to 330 mA current and produces approximately 12 mW of optical power from a single pixel, which is about 3 times higher than its predecessor. The second microLED/CMOS IC is the microLED/CMOS Current Feedback (CCFBK) driver which was designed to facilitate Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. OFDM is one of the modulation schemes, adopted from the RF domain, that was proposed to be implemented in VLC in order to increase the data transmission rate. To the best of the author’s knowledge, the microLED/CCFBK driver is the first CMOS driver for microLED that was designed to perform analogue modulation for VLC purposes. The driver is characterised and shows the ability to produce up to 3. 5 mW of optical power with a data transmission rate of up to 486 Mbit/s. The microLED/CMOS Optical Feedback (COFBK) driver is the third microLED/CMOS IC presented in this thesis. The driver looks to improve on the performance of the microLED/CCFBK driver. OFDM <b>transmission</b> requires high <b>linearity</b> to ensure low Bit Error Rate (BER) transmission. However, the optical power output of an LED is not, in general, linear with the input voltage signal. The microLED/COFBK driver looks to increase the linearity of the optical power output by integrating a microLED and a photodiode in a single pixel to create a feedback loop. Once again, to the best of the author’s knowledge, the microLED/COFBK driver is the first CMOS driver for microLED which integrates both optical source and sensor in a single pixel to help linearise the optical power output for communication purposes; in this case, VLC. For a similar range of optical power, the microLED/COFBK driver shows a reduction about 5. 3...|$|R
