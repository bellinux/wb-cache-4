The series consisted of 18, 729 patients in Finland and 4100 <b>in</b> <b>Estonia.</b> The overall estimated 5 -year relative survival rate was 67. 3 % in Finland and 55. 9 % <b>in</b> <b>Estonia.</b> The stage-adjusted 5 -year relative survival rate <b>in</b> <b>Estonia</b> was 63. 4 % (the Finnish rates used as a standard).
