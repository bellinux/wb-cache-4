5000|$|As <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gases {{equalize}} {{between the}} combustion chamber and the atmosphere, {{the difference in}} pressure decreases and <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> velocity decreases. This forms the medium-pressure body component of <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pulse ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{turbocharged}} engines with wastegate <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> {{pressure can}} change rapidly. A method to estimate <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> manifold pressure is presented for diagnosis of wastegate and turbocharger on spark-ignited engines. It {{does not require}} any extra sensors in <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> system after <b>the</b> calibration. A non-linear model is developed of <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pressure. Estimates of <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> manifold pressure relies on information from an air-to-cylinder observer and a static map of stationary <b>exhaust</b> pressure. <b>The</b> <b>exhaust</b> manifold pressure estimator is validated using a series of wastegate steps on a turbocharged SAAB 2. 3 dm 3 SI-engine. <b>The</b> <b>exhaust</b> pressure estimation is designed for steady-state conditions and the validation shows that it works well and converges within 1 to 4 seconds...|$|R
5000|$|The engine {{usually has}} a Roots blower to provide air for {{scavenging}} {{and this is}} arranged to deliver excess air so that air follows <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gases into <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> manifold. Some of this air is then forced back into the cylinder by a rise in pressure in <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> manifold resulting from <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pulse from another cylinder.|$|R
5|$|Following the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Japanese {{abandoned}} {{the attempt to}} capture Port Moresby from the sea and, on 21 July, landed ground forces at Buna in north-east Papua. After capturing the town of Kokoda {{for the second time}} on 9 August, the Japanese began advancing along the Kokoda Track towards Port Moresby. The 2,500-strong Japanese force met the 39th and 53rd Infantry Battalions, at the town of Isurava. As the battle was beginning to develop, on 26 August, members of the 2/14th, including Kingsbury, arrived at Isurava to reinforce <b>the</b> <b>exhausted</b> 39th Battalion.|$|E
5|$|The Second Battle of Passchendaele was the {{culminating}} attack {{during the}} Third Battle of Ypres of the First World War. The battle {{took place in}} the Ypres Salient area of the Western Front, in and around the Belgian village of Passchendaele, between 26 October and 10 November 1917. The Canadian Corps relieved <b>the</b> <b>exhausted</b> II Anzac Corps, continuing the advance started with the First Battle of Passchendaele and ultimately capturing the village. Beyond gaining favourable observation positions, the battle was intended to gain drier winter positions on higher ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} subsequently {{retreated to}} Chonan, where, {{the next night}} the 3rd Battalion was heavily engaged in another delaying action. The 34th Infantry lost its commander, Colonel Robert R. Martin {{as well as two}} thirds of its 3rd Battalion's strength. <b>The</b> <b>exhausted</b> 34th Infantry Regiment retreated to the Kum River, near the 24th Infantry Division's headquarters. The 24th Infantry Division would make one final delaying action before it would be forced to make its final stand around Taejon, the only major defensible city left before the Pusan Perimeter being established by the Eighth Army.|$|E
5000|$|These {{conflicting}} {{requirements are}} reconciled by constructing <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipe with diverging and converging conical sections to create pressure wave reflections which travel {{back up the}} pipe and are presented at <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> port. <b>The</b> <b>exhaust</b> port opens while there is still significant pressure in the cylinder, which drives the initial outflow of <b>exhaust.</b> As <b>the</b> pressure wave from <b>the</b> pulse of <b>exhaust</b> gas travels down the pipe, it encounters a diverging conical section; this causes a wave of negative pressure to be reflected back up the pipe, which arrives at <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> port towards <b>the</b> end of <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> phase, when <b>the</b> cylinder pressure has fallen to a low level, and helps to draw <b>the</b> remaining <b>exhaust</b> gas out of the cylinder. Further along <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipe, <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pressure wave encounters a converging conical section, and this reflects a positive pressure wave back up the pipe. This wave is timed to arrive at <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> port after scavenging is completed, thereby [...] "plugging" [...] <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> port to prevent spillage of fresh charge, and indeed may also push back into the cylinder any charge which has already spilled.|$|R
5000|$|Exhaust: {{also known}} as outlet. During <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> stroke, <b>the</b> piston once again returns from B.D.C. to T.D.C. while <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> valve is open. This action expels the spent air-fuel mixture through <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> valve.|$|R
50|$|Exhaust brakes are simpler in {{operation}} than an engine brake. Essentially, <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipe of <b>the</b> vehicle is restricted by a valve. This raises {{the pressure in}} <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> system, forcing <b>the</b> engine to work harder on <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> stroke of its cylinders, so again the engine is acting as an air compressor, with the power required to compress the air being withheld from <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipe, retarding <b>the</b> vehicle. Turbocharger retarders that restrict <b>the</b> flow of <b>exhaust</b> gas can also help in increasing <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pressure {{to achieve the same}} objective.|$|R
5|$|This time Thomas {{planned to}} launch {{simultaneous}} sorties from four gates. The main sector {{was to be}} again the Thomas gate, {{to take full advantage}} of <b>the</b> <b>exhausted</b> Muslim corps stationed there. The attacks from the other gates—Jabiya Gate, the Small Gate and the Eastern Gate—were intended to tie down the other Muslim corps so that they could not aid Shurhabil's corps at the Thomas gate.|$|E
5|$|After this, the Australian {{forces were}} heavily {{reinforced}} by the 7thDivision's 21st and 25th Brigades. Supported logistically by native Papuans who were recruited by the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit, often forcibly, to carry supplies and evacuate wounded personnel, the Australians pursued the Japanese back along the Kokoda Track. In early November, they had been forced into a small bridgehead on the north coast of Papua. Australian and US forces attacked the Japanese bridgehead in Papua in late November1942. The Allied force consisted of <b>the</b> <b>exhausted</b> 7thDivision and the inexperienced and ill-trained US 32ndInfantry Division, and was short of artillery and supplies. Due {{to a lack of}} supporting weapons and MacArthur and Blamey's insistence on a rapid advance the Allied tactics during the battle were centred on infantry assaults on the Japanese fortifications. These resulted in heavy casualties and the area was not secured until 22January1943.|$|E
5|$|At 10p.m. on March 5, the Mexican {{artillery}} ceased their bombardment. As Santa Anna had anticipated, <b>the</b> <b>exhausted</b> Texians soon {{fell into}} the first uninterrupted sleep {{many of them had}} since the siege began. Just after midnight, more than 2,000 Mexican soldiers began preparing for the final assault. Fewer than 1,800 were divided into four columns, commanded by Cos, Colonel Francisco Duque, Colonel José María Romero and Colonel Juan Morales. Veterans were positioned {{on the outside of the}} columns to better control the new recruits and conscripts in the middle. As a precaution, 500 Mexican cavalry were positioned around the Alamo to prevent escape of either Texian or Mexican soldiers. Santa Anna remained in camp with the 400 reserves. Despite the bitter cold, the soldiers were ordered not to wear overcoats which could impede their movements. Clouds concealed the moon and thus the movements of the soldiers.|$|E
50|$|The ASV {{has three}} openings: one is {{connected}} to the manifold vacuum, another {{is connected to}} <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipe and <b>the</b> third is open to the atmosphere. When a negative pulse is induced in <b>the</b> <b>exhaust,</b> air from <b>the</b> atmosphere enters <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> manifold through a one-way reed valve and serves to oxidize the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons in <b>the</b> <b>exhaust.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>exhaust</b> flow {{occupied}} most of {{the roof}} region inside the face and gradually spread out at the intersection where the face entry met the straight main entry. At this place, <b>the</b> still hot <b>exhaust</b> clung to <b>the</b> roof and wedged the main airflow out of the ceiling region. There was heat exchange between <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> flow and <b>the</b> cold ventilation flow, during which <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> lost heat and became heavier and then mixed with the surrounding main airflow; at the same time, the ventilation flow close to <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gained <b>the</b> heat and moved upward and blocked the further dilution of <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas from <b>the</b> main ventilation. Overall, the low speed of the main airflow was {{not strong enough to}} sweep <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> at <b>the</b> intersection.|$|R
50|$|In a piston-ported {{two-stroke}} engine however, {{the situation is}} more complicated due {{to the need to}} prevent unburned fuel/air mixture from passing right through the cylinders into <b>the</b> <b>exhaust.</b> During <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> phase of <b>the</b> cycle, backpressure is even more undesirable than in a four-stroke engine due to the shorter time available for <b>exhaust</b> and <b>the</b> lack of pumping action from the piston to force <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> out of <b>the</b> cylinder. However, since <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> port necessarily remains open for a time after scavenging is completed, unburned mixture can follow <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> out of <b>the</b> cylinder, wasting fuel and increasing pollution, and this can only be prevented if the pressure at <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> port is greater than that in the cylinder.|$|R
5|$|Australian and US forces {{attacked}} the Japanese bridgehead in Papua in late November 1942 {{but did not}} capture it until January 1943.

Due {{to a lack of}} supporting weapons and MacArthur and Blamey's insistence on a rapid advance the Allied tactics during the battle were centred around infantry assaults on the Japanese fortifications. These resulted in heavy casualties and the area was not secured until 22 January 1943. Throughout the fighting in Papua, most of the Australian personnel captured by Japanese troops were murdered. In response, Australian soldiers aggressively sought to kill their Japanese opponents {{for the remainder of the}} war. The Australians generally did not attempt to capture Japanese personnel, and some prisoners of war were murdered.|$|E
5|$|By October Axis {{operational}} objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region were achieved, {{with only the}} sieges of Leningrad and Sevastopol continuing. A major offensive against Moscow was renewed; after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where <b>the</b> <b>exhausted</b> troops were forced to suspend their offensive. Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential. The blitzkrieg phase {{of the war in}} Europe had ended.|$|E
5|$|Having seized Emesa, the Muslims {{were just}} a march away from Aleppo, a Byzantine stronghold, and Antioch, where Heraclius resided. Seriously alarmed by the series of setbacks, Heraclius {{prepared}} for a counterattack to reacquire the lost regions. In 635 Yazdegerd III, the Emperor of Persia, sought an alliance with the Byzantine Emperor. Heraclius married off his daughter (according to traditions, his grand daughter) Manyanh to Yazdegerd III, to cement the alliance. While Heraclius prepared for a major offensive in the Levant, Yazdegerd was to mount a simultaneous counterattack in Iraq, in what {{was meant to be}} a well-coordinated effort. When Heraclius launched his offensive in May 636, Yazdegerd could not coordinate with the maneuver—probably owing to <b>the</b> <b>exhausted</b> condition of his government—and what would have been a decisive plan missed the mark.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{deactivate}} a cylinder, <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> valve is prevented from opening after the power stroke and <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas charge is {{retained in the}} cylinder and compressed during <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> stroke. Following <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> stroke, <b>the</b> intake valve is prevented from opening. <b>The</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas in <b>the</b> cylinder is expanded and compressed {{over and over again}} and acts like a gas spring. As multiple cylinders are shut off at a time (cylinders 1, 4, 6 and 7 for a V8), the power required for compression of <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas in one cylinder is countered by the decompression of retained exhaust gas in another. When more power is called for, <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> valve is reactivated and <b>the</b> old <b>exhaust</b> gas is expelled during <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> stroke. <b>The</b> intake valve is likewise reactivated and normal engine operation is resumed. The net effect of cylinder deactivation is an improvement in fuel economy and likewise a reduction in exhaust emissions. General Motors was the first to modify existing, production engines to enable cylinder deactivation, with the introduction of the Cadillac L62 [...] "V8-6-4" [...] in 1981.|$|R
40|$|Particulate {{emission}} from {{diesel engines}} is receiving {{a great deal}} of attention due to its probable carcinogenic property. In <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipe of a diesel engine, the change of <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas temperature can result in nucleation and condensation of volatile materials and coagulation of particulates. The objective of the present study is to investigate experimentally the transformation of diesel particulates within <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipe when <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas is being cooled. Using a water cooler to control and adjust <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas temperature, <b>the</b> influences of exhaust-gas cooling on mass concentration, composition, size distribution and number-averaged diameter of the particulates, under different engine operating conditions, were analyzed. In addition, the effect of the flow rate of <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas in <b>the</b> cooler on the number-averaged diameter of the particulates was also discussed. The results showed that the transformation of the diesel particulates in <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipe depended mainly on the level of cooling, the concentration of the volatile materials, the initial concentration of the particulates in <b>the</b> <b>exhaust,</b> and <b>the</b> residence time of <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas within <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipe. <b>The</b> mass concentration and the soluble organic fraction of the particulates increased, while the gaseous hydrocarbon concentration decreased upon cooling <b>the</b> <b>exhaust.</b> Coupled with these were a decrease in the total number of particulates and an increase in the number-averaged diameter of the particulates, as measured by the Electrical Aerosol Size Analyzer. The results will be useful in understanding the mechanisms leading to changes in diesel particulates in an exhaust pipe. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|An {{exhaust brake}} {{is a means}} of slowing a diesel engine by closing off <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> path from <b>the</b> engine, causing <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gases to be {{compressed}} in <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> manifold, and in the cylinder. Since <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> is being compressed, and there is no fuel being applied, the engine works backwards, slowing down the vehicle.

5|$|However, the Germans {{launched}} a counterattack at 03:15 on 16 December, throwing in {{men from the}} 6th Parachute Regiment, sent by Herr to the 26th Panzer Division to relieve <b>the</b> <b>exhausted</b> 9th Panzergrenadier Regiment. These troops had arrived late that evening after a long journey. Supported by tanks, they attacked the right-hand New Zealand positions held by the 21st NZ Battalion, but were held off and had retired by daylight. Meanwhile, even before the German counterattack had been repelled, the 20th Regiment had attacked toward Orsogna with two squadrons of Sherman tanks. Under intense artillery and anti-tank fire, the tanks and infantry became separated and the tanks became a target rather than a threat.|$|E
5|$|Realizing that he {{had lost}} the initiative, was low on {{ammunition}} and food, and had more than 10,000 of his men killed, wounded, or missing, Beauregard could go no further. He withdrew beyond Shiloh Church, leaving 5,000 men under Breckinridge as a covering force, and massed Confederate batteries at the church and on the ridge south of Shiloh Branch. Confederate forces kept the Union men in position on the Corinth Road until 5 p.m., then began an orderly withdrawal southwest to Corinth. <b>The</b> <b>exhausted</b> Union soldiers did not pursue much farther than the original Sherman and Prentiss encampments.

5|$|The French {{arrived in}} Armenia {{in the late}} evening on Friday, December 9 and {{relieved}} <b>the</b> <b>exhausted</b> Armenian workers who then returned to Yerevan.

The Americans donated generously as well, with Washington dispatching eight official planeloads of official relief aid plus a Lockheed C-141 Starlifter from Italy. Private donations from the United States were also significant. Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca arranged for a fund drive, and in Chicago (one of five major Armenian population centers in the US) the community raised $800,000 and donated 20,000 pounds of supplies.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{hot gases}} {{produced}} by the internal combustion engines passes through <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> valve and causes high temperatures in <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> valve and its seat.

5|$|This double {{disaster}} {{destroyed the}} Pope's {{plans for the}} crusade, as he had envisaged it to land in Theodore's rear while he was engaged with Robert's army. At the same time, the prospective leader of the crusade, William VI of Montferrat, fell ill. In November, the Pope was forced to postpone the crusade's departure for the next spring. With news of the Latin defeats and the postponement of the crusade, <b>the</b> <b>exhausted</b> defenders of Thessalonica surrendered the city to Theodore sometime in December 1224. The crusade to relieve it sailed in March 1225, and landed in Thessaly at Halmyros. The Crusader army was soon decimated by dysentery, allegedly because the Greeks had poisoned the local water supply. William of Montferrat himself succumbed to it, and {{the remnants of the}} army left Greece.

5|$|This final Confederate assault {{through the}} Wheatfield {{continued}} past Houck's Ridge into the Valley of Death at about 7:30 p.m. The brigades of Anderson, Semmes, and Kershaw were exhausted from hours of combat {{in the summer}} heat and advanced east with units jumbled up together. Wofford's brigade followed to the left along the Wheatfield Road. As they reached the northern shoulder of Little Round Top, they were met with a counterattack from the 3rd Division (the Pennsylvania Reserves) of the V Corps, under Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford. The brigade of Col. William McCandless, including a company from the Gettysburg area, spearheaded the attack and drove <b>the</b> <b>exhausted</b> Confederates back beyond the Wheatfield to Stony Hill. Realizing that his troops were too far advanced and exposed, Crawford pulled the brigade back to the east edge of the Wheatfield.|$|E
5|$|With the {{infantry}} heavily engaged, Eugene's cavalry picked {{its way across}} the Nebel.

Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>exhausted</b> French were unable to follow up their advantage, and the two cavalry forces tried to regroup and reorder their ranks. However, without cavalry support, and threatened with envelopment, the Prussian and Danish infantry were in turn forced to pull back across the Nebel.

Ten infantry colours were lost to the Bavarians, and hundreds of prisoners taken; it was only through the leadership of Eugene and the Prussian Prince that the imperial infantry were prevented from abandoning the field.|$|E
