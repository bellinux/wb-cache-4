The first group in 2008 traveled to Mekelle in Northern Ethiopia and since 2009 the students have traveled to Ambo, Ethiopia. Successful applicants are trained and engage in a range of voluntary work for those struck by extreme poverty in Ambo, including teaching in the local Vincentian school, working in the Vincentian Food Programme, the Vincentian School for the Deaf, a leprosy village befriending members of the community and coaching Ambo United Football Club. Students are required to raise sufficient funds to meet their <b>travel</b> <b>and</b> <b>subsistence</b> <b>expenses,</b> and events are organised within and without the College to raise funds. This Development Programme has enabled the construction of expanded education facilities and the provision of medical and food supplies.|$|E

50|$|A {{characteristic}} of the representation of INGOs at the Council of Europe {{is the fact that}} it is done on a voluntary basis. On the one hand, the INGO representatives do not get any compensation for their work, regardless if they have an official function in the INGO Conference’s structure or not. On the other hand they themselves or their INGOs pay for their <b>travel</b> <b>and</b> <b>subsistence</b> costs during their stay in Strasbourg. With one exception: The members of the Standing Committee have their travel costs reimbursed by the Council of Europe for the four ordinary annual sessions of the Conference.

Ó Domhnaill claimed that in these instances he had left one event <b>and</b> <b>travelled</b> across the country to attend another event only to later return to the first event. However, this was not reflected in Ó Domhnaill's expenses forms. Ó Domhnaill's habit of submitting his expenses claims many months (and, at times, longer) after incurring them was also noted.|$|R
