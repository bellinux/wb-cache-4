5|$|Because of {{the last}} years' massive urban development, in 2005 some areas of Cluj were named as districts (Sopor, Borhanci, Becaș, Făget, Zorilor South), {{but most of them}} are still {{construction}} sites. Beside these, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> building areas like Tineretului, Lombului or Oser, which are likely to become districts in the following years.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} {{population}} density on sexual selection for convict cichlids has been studied. When nest density was greater, the females {{tended to be}} larger, which is more accurately explained by density-dependent mate preference and mating competition, as opposed to predation and resource competition. Moreover, as the two nest density regimes were compared, with one high and one low, {{there was no significant}} difference in brood survival between the two; however, the convict cichlids did prefer to breed farther away from each other, not in close proximity. This indicates that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> costs with breeding in an environment with high population density, an example being energy loss because of the resulting increased aggression when guarding territory.|$|E

An example is the Knaster–Tarski theorem, which states that the set of fixed points of a monotone function on a complete lattice is again a complete lattice. This is easily seen to be a generalization of the above observation about the images of closure operators, since these are exactly the sets of fixed points of such operators.|$|E
