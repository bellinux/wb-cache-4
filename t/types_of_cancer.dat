40|$|Abstract Background Advancement in gene {{profiling}} techniques {{makes it}} possible to measure expressions of thousands of genes and identify genes associated with development and progression <b>of</b> <b>cancer.</b> The identified cancer-associated genes can be used for diagnosis, prognosis prediction, and treatment selection. Most existing cancer microarray studies have been focusing on the identification of genes associated with a specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer.</b> Recent biomedical studies suggest that different cancers may share common susceptibility genes. A comprehensive description of the associations between genes and <b>cancers</b> requires identification <b>of</b> not only multiple genes associated with a specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> but also genes associated with multiple cancers. Results In this article, we propose the Mc. TGD (Multi-cancer Threshold Gradient Descent), an integrative analysis approach capable of analyzing multiple microarray studies on different cancers. The Mc. TGD is the first regularized approach to conduct "two-dimensional" selection of genes with joint effects on cancer development. Simulation studies show that the Mc. TGD can more accurately identify genes associated with multiple cancers than meta analysis based on "one-dimensional" methods. As a byproduct, identification accuracy of genes associated with only one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> may also be improved. We use the Mc. TGD to analyze seven microarray studies investigating development <b>of</b> seven different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancers.</b> We identify one gene associated with six <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancers</b> and four genes associated with five <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancers.</b> In addition, we also identify 11, 9, 18, and 17 genes associated with 4 to 1 <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancers,</b> respectively. We evaluate prediction performance using a Leave-One-Out cross validation approach and find that only 4 (out of 570) subjects cannot be properly predicted. Conclusion The Mc. TGD can identify a short list of genes associated with one or multiple <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancers.</b> The identified genes are considerably different from those identified using meta analysis or analysis of marginal effects. </p...|$|R

5|$|There are {{currently}} no therapeutic approaches targeting CASS4, {{and in the}} absence of a catalytic domain and no extracellular moieties, it may be challenging to generate such an agent. However, CASS4 may ultimately be relevant in clinical practice as a possible marker to assess prognosis and outcome in cases of NSCLC (and possibly other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer).</b> At present, its greatest clinical value is likely to be as a predictive variant for severity and onset of Alzheimer's disease and cystic fibrosis.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin, {{also known}} as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a {{medication}} used to treat pain, fever, or inflammation. Specific inflammatory conditions in which aspirin is used include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever. Aspirin given shortly {{after a heart attack}} decreases the risk of death. Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots, in people at high risk. Aspirin may also decrease the risk of certain <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer,</b> particularly colorectal cancer. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works similar to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.|$|E
5|$|Following initial {{interest}} in brachytherapy in Europe and the US, its use {{declined in the}} middle of the twentieth century due to the problem of radiation exposure to operators from the manual application of the radioactive sources. However, the development of remote afterloading systems, which allow the radiation to be delivered from a shielded safe, and the use of new radioactive sources in the 1950s and 1960s, reduced the risk of unnecessary radiation exposure to the operator and patients. This, together with more recent advancements in three-dimensional imaging modalities, computerised treatment planning systems and delivery equipment has made brachytherapy a safe and effective treatment for many <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> today.|$|E

5|$|The {{result of}} the lack of medical {{information}} on WSW is that medical professionals and some lesbians perceive lesbians as having lower risks of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases or <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer.</b> When women do seek medical attention, medical professionals often fail to take a complete medical history. In a recent study of 2,345 lesbian and bisexual women, only 9.3% had claimed they had ever been asked their sexual orientation by a physician. A third of the respondents believed disclosing their sexual history would result in a negative reaction, and 30% had received a negative reaction from a medical professional after identifying themselves as lesbian or bisexual. A patient's complete history helps medical professionals identify higher risk areas and corrects assumptions about the personal histories of women. In a similar survey of 6,935 lesbians, 77% had had sexual contact with one or more male partners, and 6% had that contact within the previous year.|$|E
5|$|While {{the rates}} of the leading causes of death, {{cardiovascular}} disease, cancer and lung disease, are similar in women and men, women have different experiences. Lung cancer has overtaken all other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> as {{the leading cause of}} cancer death in women, followed by breast cancer, colorectal, ovarian, uterine and cervical cancers. While smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, amongst nonsmoking women the risk of developing cancer is three times greater than amongst nonsmoking men. Despite this, breast cancer remains the commonest cancer in women in developed countries, {{and is one of the}} more important chronic diseases of women, while cervical cancer remains one of the commonest cancers in developing countries, associated with human papilloma virus (HPV), an important sexually transmitted disease. HPV vaccine together with screening offers the promise of controlling these diseases. Other important health issues for women include cardiovascular disease, depression, dementia, osteoporosis and anemia. A major impediment to advancing women's health has been their underrepresentation in research studies, an inequity being addressed in the United States and other western nations by the establishment of centers of excellence in women's health research and large scale clinical trials such as the Women's Health Initiative.|$|E
