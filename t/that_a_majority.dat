5|$|Although {{there are}} many diverse pathogens, {{many of which are}} {{constantly}} mutating, it is a surprise <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> of individuals remain free of infections. Thus, maintenance of health requires the body to recognize all pathogens (antigens they present or produce) likely to exist. This is achieved by maintaining a pool of immensely large (about 109) clones of B cells, each of which reacts against a specific epitope by recognizing and producing antibodies against it. However, at any given time very few clones actually remain receptive to their specific epitope. Thus, approximately 107 different epitopes can be recognized by all the B cell clones combined. Moreover, in a lifetime, an individual usually requires the generation of antibodies against very few antigens in comparison with the number that the body can recognize and respond against.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, recent studies show an {{increasingly}} positive attitude {{of patients and}} physicians (M.D. and D.O.) towards the use of manual therapy as a valid, safe and effective treatment modality. One survey, published in the Journal of Continuing Medical Education, found <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> of physicians (81%) and patients (76%) felt that manual manipulation (MM) was safe, and over half (56% of physicians and 59% of patients) felt that manipulation should {{be available in the}} primary care setting. Although less than half (40%) of the physicians reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one-quarter (20%) have administered MM in their practice, most (71%) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in MM. Another small study examined the interest and ability of M.D. residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills, including OMT. It showed that after a 1-month elective rotation, the M.D. residents responded favorably to the experience.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{an attempt}} was made to {{relocate}} the original quarry where A. fragillimus and other species had been found, using ground-penetrating radar in an attempt to image bones still buried in the ground. This attempt failed because the fossilized mudstone bones were the same density as the surrounding rock, making it impossible to differentiate the two. A study of the local topography also showed that the fossil-bearing rock strata was severely eroded, and probably was so at the time Lucas made his discovery of A. fragillimus, indicating <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> of the skeleton was gone by the time the vertebra and femur were recovered.|$|E
5|$|In the Lord High Steward's Court, a {{group of}} Lords Triers, sitting under the {{chairmanship}} of the Lord High Steward, acted as judge and jury. By custom the number of Triers was not fewer than 23, so <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> was a minimum of 12, but in fact the number ranged from 20 to 35. The power to choose which peers served as Triers lay with the Crown and was sometimes subject to abuse, as only those peers who agreed with the monarch's position would be summoned to the Court of the Lord High Steward, thereby favouring the desired verdict. This practice was ended by the Treason Act 1695, passed during the reign of King William III. The Act required that all peers be summoned as Triers. All subsequent trials were held before the full House of Lords.|$|E

5|$|Many petroglyphs or carved {{images of}} dogs were found near {{religious}} centers and chiefly residential areas indicating their venerated status and {{importance in the}} culture. A survey by American archaeologist Sidsel N. Millerstrom noted <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> of dog petroglyphs {{have been found in}} the valleys of ʻAʻakapa, Haʻatuatua, and Hatiheu on the northern coast of Nuku Hiva, the meʻae Vaikivi on Ua Huka, and the meʻae Iʻipona and Eiaone Valley on Hiva Oa. Their regional distributions possibly reflected the role of dogs as symbols of tribal/clan loyalty and identity in the islands. They were totem animals associated with the Nakiʻi tribe.|$|E
5|$|More than 99percent of Benet {{graduates}} go to college; roughly 1percent {{serve in}} the military. Benet students were implicated in the University of Illinois clout scandal, in which some applicants were given preferential admission to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) despite having sub-par qualifications. The Chicago Tribune, investigating the scandal, reported <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> of students who were admitted to UIUC through political favors came from elite, affluent high schools such as Benet, where families were politically connected with elected officials and university trustees. An email between admissions officers revealed that a female Benet student {{was admitted to the}} university's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, {{despite the fact that she}} had ranked lower than 27 of her classmates who were put on a waiting list or denied admission. Between 2005 and 2009, thirteen applicants from Benet were alleged to have had political connections; eight of them were admitted to UIUC.|$|E
5|$|Old Louisville is a {{historic}} district and neighborhood in central Louisville, Kentucky, USA. It is the third largest such district in the United States, and the largest preservation district featuring almost entirely Victorian architecture. It is also unique in <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> of its structures are made of brick, and the neighborhood contains the highest concentration of residential homes with stained glass windows in the U.S. Many of the buildings are in the Victorian-era styles of Romanesque, Queen Anne, Italianate, among others; {{and a large number}} of blocks have had few or no buildings razed. There are also several 20th-century buildings from 15 to 20 stories.|$|E

5|$|The Hong Kong Institute of Planners, the {{majority}} of whose members work in government departments, had backed the in-situ preservation of the pier. There was uproar in May 2008 when it made an apparent U-turn in a position paper submitted to the government backing the relocation to a waterfront location, based on a sparsely attended meeting. It then submitted a revised paper presenting <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> of its members supported such a move as a conclusion prior to {{the completion of a}} survey.

5|$|The {{congregation}} {{was heavily}} involved in World WarII, with many members serving in the armed forces, including Dudley Weinberg, who had succeeded Cohn as assistant rabbi. Children of Israel published a special newsletter for overseas members; {{by the end of}} the war, approximately four hundred congregants had served—and fourteen had died—in the U.S. military. As with many other Reform congregations, the members of Temple Israel were split on the issue of Zionism. It is likely <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> were anti-Zionist, and the synagogue president joined the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism, though other prominent members supported Zionism, and still others were simply non-Zionist. Ettelson initially opposed Zionism, though he did not join the council. With the growth of antisemitism inside and outside the United States, his views changed, and he was an early member of the local chapter of the Zionist United Palestine Appeal. Nevertheless, he successfully kept the issue from becoming divisive at the temple.|$|E
5|$|The {{design was}} adopted by an Act of Parliament in 1813, which {{permitted}} the commissioners to borrow £600,000 for building and construction. The street was intended to have commercial purposes and it was expected <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> of the income would come from private capital. Nash took responsibility for design and valuation of all properties. Construction of the road resulted in demolishing numerous properties, disrupting trade and polluting the air with dust. Existing tenants had first offer to purchase leases on the new properties. The Treasury supported the proposal because, {{in the aftermath of}} the lengthy Napoleonic Wars, there was an urgent need for the government to create jobs. Government expenditure was low because the design relied heavily upon private developers, such as Nash himself. The buildings were to be let on 99-year leases, as was common at the time, and income could be recouped in the form of ground rent.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{developed}} {{over a period}} of 10 years by Atchison, {{who came up with the}} initial concept after seeing the 1994 Scripps National Spelling Bee and noting <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> of the competitors came from good socioeconomic backgrounds. After completing the script in 1999, Atchison won one of the Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting in 2000, which attracted producers Sid Ganis and Nancy Hult Ganis. After an initial inability to secure funding, the project got a second wind as a result of the success of the 2002 documentary film Spellbound. Lionsgate Films undertook the production in 2004 and in the following year it was filmed in South Los Angeles on a budget of over $6 million.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{continued}} use of the name {{has come from the}} team's owners and a majority of fans, which include some Native Americans. Supporters say that the name honors the achievements and virtues of Native Americans, and that it is not intended in a negative manner. Some, such as team president Bruce Allen, also point to the use of Redskins by three high school teams, two on reservations, that have a majority of Native American students. Supporters have asserted <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> of Native Americans are not offended by the name based upon a national poll by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004. In a commentary published soon after that poll, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism. Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity of public opinion polling. In May 2016, the Washington Post published a poll that duplicated the central question posed in 2004, yielding an identical result.|$|E
5|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{is a book}} by American {{psychologist}} Clarence Arthur Tripp, {{in which}} the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of homosexuality, and also attempts to explain heterosexuality and bisexuality. The book {{was first published in}} 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company, and later republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality, that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions, and that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning. Tripp considers early puberty and early masturbation important factors in the development of male homosexuality, and maintains <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> of people are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He also argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general.|$|E
