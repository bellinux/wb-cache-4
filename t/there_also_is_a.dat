500|$|There is some {{confusion}} {{as to the}} correct spelling of his name. He is variously referred to as [...] McNish, McNeish, and in Alexander Macklin's diary of the expedition, MacNish.

2500|$|According to {{anthropologist}} Helen Fisher, {{there are}} numerous psychological reasons for adultery.

[...] "We have two brain systems: One of them is linked to attachment and romantic love, {{and then there is}} the other brain system, which is purely sex drive."
