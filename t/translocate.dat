The resulting deconstruction of cellular components is primarily carried out by specialized proteases known as caspases, but the proteasome also plays important and diverse roles in the apoptotic process. The involvement of the proteasome in this process is indicated by both the increase in protein ubiquitination, and of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes that is observed well in advance of apoptosis. During apoptosis, proteasomes localized to the nucleus have also been observed to <b>translocate</b> to outer membrane blebs characteristic of apoptosis.|$|E

5|$|Proteins are {{assembled}} from {{amino acids}} using information encoded in genes. Each protein {{has its own}} unique amino acid sequence that is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein. The genetic code {{is a set of}} three-nucleotide sets called codons and each three-nucleotide combination designates an amino acid, for example AUG (adenine-uracil-guanine) is the code for methionine. Because DNA contains four nucleotides, the total number of possible codons is 64; hence, there is some redundancy in the genetic code, with some amino acids specified by more than one codon. Genes encoded in DNA are first transcribed into pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) by proteins such as RNA polymerase. Most organisms then process the pre-mRNA (also known as a primary transcript) using various forms of Post-transcriptional modification to form the mature mRNA, which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome. In prokaryotes the mRNA may either be used as soon as it is produced, or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid. In contrast, eukaryotes make mRNA in the cell nucleus and then <b>translocate</b> it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis then takes place. The rate of protein synthesis is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach up to 20 amino acids per second.|$|E

Here we examine sex-specific differences between resident and <b>translocated</b> house sparrows Passer domesticus in reproductive success and survival, and the contribution of <b>translocated</b> individuals {{to the growth of}} a local population. We found evidence for assortative mating based on origin revealed by fewer parentages between <b>translocated</b> males and resident females than expected, and the total number of fledglings produced by such pairs was lower. The reproductive success of <b>translocated</b> males was positively related {{to the size of the}} throat badge (a sexual ornament), such that only <b>translocated</b> males with a large badge size were as successful as resident males. However, offspring with parents of different origin had higher survival than offspring with parents of the same origin, which suggests hybrid vigour. The contribution of resident and <b>translocated</b> individuals to the stochastic component of the long-run growth rate of the population was similar; neither the mean individual contributions in fitness nor the demographic variance differed between the two groups. Thus, this experiment shows that <b>translocated</b> individuals may have a similar demographic influence on the growth of local populations as resident individuals. Still, the intermixing of <b>translocated</b> and resident individuals was low, and fitness differed according to origin in relation to individual differences in a sexually selected trait.

40|$|The {{adaptation}} of <b>translocated</b> organisms {{to a new}} environment {{in the first years}} after their release is crucial in translocation programs because it may affect survival and reproductive success. Therefore, identifying the factors determining resource selection by the relocated animals is essential to improve the planning and the outcome of such programs. Using data collected in 2006 – 2009 in the framework of a restocking program, we studied the temporal variation of habitat selection in 14 <b>translocated</b> Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) during the year of their release and the following 3 years.

We tested the differences in habitat selection and home range size between the <b>translocated</b> and resident individuals and compared the spatial overlap between the groups. As expected, the dissimilarities decreased annually. The <b>translocated</b> and resident ibex almost immediately selected the same habitat resources, but the <b>translocated</b> individuals required 3 years to become fully socially assimilated. Our results indicated that habitat selection by gregarious species in a new environment is primarily driven by specific ecological requirements and that sociality plays a significant role. The <b>translocated</b> individuals tended to colonize areas already occupied by residents, either to fulfill social requirements and/or because the location of resident individuals may indicate high-quality habitat.

Aim: We sought to evaluate whether <b>translocating</b> stock-raiding leopards (Panthera pardus) into a protected area with resident conspecifics in Botswana is effective in dealing with 'problem' carnivores. Methods: We assessed release-site fidelity, ranging behaviour, individual survival and reduction of conflict after translocation of four <b>translocated</b> leopards in relation to four resident conspecifics, which were tracked from 24 days up to 4 years. Key results: None of the <b>translocated</b> leopards showed release-site fidelity; they either returned to the trap site or showed extensive roaming behaviour after release. Three of the four <b>translocated</b> leopards reportedly resumed stock-raiding and were shot when ranging outside of protected areas, which apparently was a consequence of being released into an area already occupied by territorial conspecifics. On the basis of satellite telemetry, the linear movement distance of one <b>translocated</b> leopard (1249 km) and the range size of three resident female leopards (513 ± 124 km 2) are the largest on record. Conclusions: From comparing the survival and ranging behaviour of <b>translocated</b> leopards with that of resident conspecifics, we conclude that translocation was not an effective management tool for dealing with stock-raiding leopards in our study. Implications: Rather than <b>translocating</b> 'problem' carnivores, efforts should focus on reducing the potential for problems to develop, most importantly on improving livestock-husbandry practices...|$|R

However, in animals with thick dermal layers, such as adult reptiles, dermal melanophores often form three-dimensional units with other chromatophores. These dermal chromatophore units (DCU) consist of an uppermost xanthophore or erythrophore layer, then an iridophore layer, and finally a basket-like melanophore layer with processes covering the iridophores.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 33 - 38). Translocation {{of threatened}} or vulnerable species {{is a tool}} increasingly used for conservation and management, and in some species the behavioral and physiological responses to translocation may undermine the success of translocation efforts. For the federally protected desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), translocation is a strategy used to manage declining populations, yet post-translocation responses in this species are poorly understood. Here, we radio tracked 40 tortoises in Fall 2009 and 40 tortoises in Spring 2010 to explore homing ability and movement patterns; we further considered differences in behavior and habitat use between <b>translocated</b> and non-translocated tortoises, and assessed how these differences affected carapace temperatures. Tortoises {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three treatment groups: <b>translocated</b> (displaced 2, 5, or 8 km from their source location), handling control (used to measure the effect of handling tortoises during experimental manipulation) or control (as a control treatment). After translocation, twenty percent of the <b>translocated</b> tortoises were able to navigate to their source location, and translocation distance had an effect on their ability to navigate home, with males and females demonstrating similar homing abilities. We found 44 % of tortoises in the 2 km <b>translocated</b> group returned home, whereas no tortoises in the 8 km <b>translocated</b> group did. We also found that <b>translocated</b> tortoises moved more than the control groups, with some individuals moving > 10 km from the translocation site. These patterns were persistent even accounting for seasonal and sex differences in movement. Further, we found that <b>translocated</b> tortoises exhibited different placement, position and activity patterns within their habitat than non-translocated tortoises. We also found that while all tortoises showed an association with large shrubs in the landscape, the <b>translocated</b> tortoises showed a significantly closer association to shrubs and showed a stronger affinity to particular shrub species. Although there were no significant carapace temperature differences between <b>translocated</b> and non-translocated tortoises across all ambient temperatures, we found <b>translocated</b> tortoises had significantly higher carapace temperatures when the ambient temperature was > 29 ??C.

25|$|The Sec-dependent {{system is}} divided into three {{pathways}}. TAAs are one of those pathways and also go by the name type Vc secretion pathway. The mechanism is split into two. First, the protein must move across the inner membrane or, in other words, <b>translocate,</b> in a Sec-dependent manner via the periplasm. The signal peptide on the N-terminus acts as a temporary tether to hold it in place. Next, it must move to the outer membrane. The trimerisation aids translocation, and no translocation would occur without its beta-barrel membrane anchor.

25|$|Anthrax toxin is a three-protein {{exotoxin}} secreted by virulent {{strains of}} the bacterium, Bacillus anthracis—the causative agent of anthrax. The toxin was first discovered by Harry Smith in 1954. Anthrax toxin is composed of a cell-binding protein, known as protective antigen (PA), and two enzyme components, called edema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF). These three protein components act together to impart their physiological effects. Assembled complexes containing the toxin components are endocytosed. In the endosome, the enzymatic components of the toxin <b>translocate</b> into the cytoplasm of a target cell. Once in the cytosol, the enzymatic components of the toxin disrupts various immune cell functions, namely cellular signaling and cell migration. The toxin may even induce cell lysis, as is observed for macrophage cells. Anthrax toxin allows the bacteria to evade the immune system, proliferate, and ultimately kill the host animal. Research on anthrax toxin also provides insight into the generation of macromolecular assemblies, and on protein translocation, pore formation, endocytosis, and other biochemical processes.|$|E
25|$|Beta-catenin is a proto-oncogene. Mutations of {{this gene}} are {{commonly}} found {{in a variety of}} cancers: in primary hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, ovarial carcinoma, breast cancer, lung cancer and glioblastoma. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of all tissue samples sequenced from all cancers display mutations in the CTNNB1 gene. Most of these mutations cluster on a tiny area of the N-terminal segment of β-catenin: the β-TrCP binding motif. Loss-of-function mutations of this motif essentially make ubiquitinylation and degradation of β-catenin impossible. It will cause β-catenin to <b>translocate</b> to the nucleus without any external stimulus and continuously drive transcription of its target genes. Increased nuclear β-catenin levels have also been noted in basal cell carcinoma (BCC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), prostate cancer (CaP), pilomatrixoma (PTR) and medulloblastoma (MDB) These observations may or may not implicate a mutation in the β-catenin gene: other Wnt pathway components can also be faulty.|$|E

In 1993, 2 populations of an atyid shrimp (Paratya australiensis:Atyidae) from different subcatchments of the Brisbane River, Queensland, Australia, were mixed {{as a result of a}} translocation. At the time, they were thought to represent slightly divergent populations of a single species. However, subsequent molecular analysis showed that they were significantly divergent. An analysis of patterns at one of the sites in 2001 suggested that the <b>translocated</b> lineage might be sending the resident population extinct in one of the streams. Analysis of mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and 3 allozyme loci indicated that the explanation for the outcome might be related to asymmetrical hybridization and nonviability of hybrids between resident females and <b>translocated</b> males. We present data for 2002 and an analysis of samples that had been collected prior to the 2001 study, but not analyzed. We tested 3 hypotheses: 1) the <b>translocated</b> genotypes would continue to increase in relative frequency at sites above the translocation site because their site of origin was at higher altitudes, to which they were expected to be better adapted; 2) at intermediate sites, the relative frequency of <b>translocated</b> alleles in juveniles would increase relative to in their parents; and 3) resident genotypes would survive better than <b>translocated</b> genotypes within a generation, especially at lower and intermediate elevations. <b>Translocated</b> genotypes increased extremely rapidly at the most upstream site. Consistent evidence was present for higher relative frequency of <b>translocated</b> alleles in juveniles relative to their parents, both in the generation following the 2001 study and in the pre- 2001 samples. With the exception of in the upstream site, <b>translocated</b> genotypes had lower fitness within a generation than resident genotypes.

Fertilization of the egg causes a rotation of the outer cortical layers, moving clusters of the Frizzled and Dsh proteins closer to the equatorial region. β-catenin will be enriched locally {{under the influence of}} Wnt signaling pathway in the cells that inherit this portion of the cytoplasm. It will eventually <b>translocate</b> to the nucleus to bind TCF3 in order to activate several genes that induce dorsal cell characteristics.

25|$|ABC {{transporters}} {{are active}} transporters, that is, they require {{energy in the}} form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to <b>translocate</b> substrates across cell membranes. These proteins harness the energy of ATP binding and/or hydrolysis to drive conformational changes in the transmembrane domain (TMD) and consequently transports molecules. Both ABC importers and exporters have a common mechanism in transporting substrates because of the similarities in their structures. The mechanism that describes the conformational changes associated with binding of substrate is the alternating-access model. In this model, the substrate binding site alternates between outward- and inward-facing conformations. The relative binding affinities of the two conformations for the substrate largely determines the net direction of transport. For importers, since translocation is directed from the periplasm to the cytoplasm, then the outward-facing conformation will have higher binding affinity for substrate. In contrast, the substrate binding affinity in exporters will be greater in the inward-facing conformation. A model that describes the conformational changes in the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) as a result of ATP binding and hydrolysis is the ATP-switch model. This model presents two principal conformations of the NBDs: formation of a closed dimer upon binding two ATP molecules and dissociation to an open dimer facilitated by ATP hydrolysis and release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Switching between the open and closed dimer conformations induces conformational changes in the TMD resulting in substrate translocation.|$|E
25|$|Anthrax toxin protein {{components}} must assemble into holotoxin complexes to function. In {{order for}} LF and EF to function inside a target cell, they must localize {{to the cell}} and enter its cytoplasm. Through a series of steps, PA can <b>translocate</b> EF and LF into the cell (Fig. 2). This process starts when the 83-kDa form of PA, called PA83, binds to an anthrax toxin receptor. There are two known homologous receptors, which bind to PA83, called tumor endothelium marker-8 (TEM8) and capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2). Then a 20 kDa fragment (PA20) is cleaved off PA83's amino terminus by membrane endoproteases from the furin family. When PA20 dissociates, the remaining receptor-bound portion of PA, called PA63, may assemble into either a heptameric or octameric ring-shaped oligomer. This ring-shaped oligomer {{is often referred to}} as the pre-pore (or pre-channel) form of PA, since later in the pathway it will become a translocase pore (or channel). The surface of the pre-pore oligomer, which was exposed upon release of the PA20 moiety, can then bind to LF and EF. The heptameric and octameric forms of the PA oligomer may then bind with up to three or four molecules of EF and/or LF, respectively. The cell then endocytoses these assembled complexes and carries them to an acidic compartment in the cell. The low pH encountered in the endosome causes the PA63 pre-channel to convert into a cation-selective channel. EF and LF are driven through the channel by a pH gradient, allowing the enzyme factors to enter the cytosol.|$|E
