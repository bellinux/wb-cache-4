They are {{interrupted}} by the widow Magdalena, who tells them that Jonas has just committed suicide with a rifle. Tomas drives, alone, to the scene, and stoically helps the police cover Jonas's body with a tarp. Märta arrives on foot, and she and Tomas drive off to her home, where she invites him in to <b>take</b> <b>some</b> <b>medicine</b> for his cold. Waiting in Märta's classroom attached to her house, Tomas finally lashes out at her, telling her first that he rejected her because {{he was tired of}} the gossip about them. When that fails to deter her affections, Tomas then tells her that he was tired of her problems, her attempts to care for him, and her constant talking, and that Märta could never measure up to his late wife, the only woman he has ever loved. Though shocked by the attack, Märta agrees to drive with him to the Persson house. Informed of Jonas's suicide, Karin collapses onto the stairs and wonders how she and her children will go on. Tomas makes a perfunctory offer of help, and leaves.|$|E

When he last measured himself, about 20 years ago, he said, he was 7 feet 7 inches. But the measurements for the Guinness book showed he had grown another inch. Bell said he has a medical condition called gigantism, which causes excessive growth hormone secretion during childhood.

40|$|Producción CientíficaThe aim of {{the study}} was to assess {{patterns}} of the use of medicines by the general population older than 0 years. The study was based on the information contained in the computerized database from the 1993 Spanish Household Health Survey. A representative sample of the population older than 0 was identi- ®ed, and a survey of 26, 334 persons was carried out. Of the population 45. 3 % had <b>taken</b> <b>some</b> <b>medicine</b> in the last 2 weeks prior to the carrying out of the survey. The proportion was greater for women (50. 6 %) than for men (39. 6 %). With increasing age, the frequency and amount of medication use increased. A little over 20 % of the medicines used were not prescribed by a doctor (self-medication). Data show the frequency of the use of medicines by the Spanish population. # 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

Eventually, she and Liv double-date with Nick and his friend, Rider, at a bowling alley. Mini tries to steal the keys to Nick's house, but Rider suggests they go to his. There, he and Liv hook up and start to have sex. Mini, realising that Nick will {{want to do the}} same, first goes to the bathroom and <b>takes</b> <b>some</b> <b>medicine,</b> resulting in her throwing up on Nick before they can get too far. Nick and Liv take Mini home and sleep on her floor. The next morning, however, she wakes up and, upon seeing them together, immediately suspects the worst - that Liv secretly wants Nick. At school, Mini is mocked by Franky's group, and believes Liv spread the story. She attempts to call both Nick and Liv to help her with the fashion show, but finds Nick's phone in the changing room, discovering 3 missed calls from Liv earlier. Locating Liv and Nick at the amphitheatre, practing their dance, and Liv wearing Mini's dress, she immediately confronts them about their tardiness and demands she gives her her dress back. She is immediately bombarded with questions and complaints from the others, as there are not enough dresses and many are too small, and immediately passes out. She is told to return home to recuperate. Realising that she may {{be on the verge of}} losing Nick, Mini prepares to have sex with him, and returns to school to discover he and Liv are doing their dance together, using Franky and Grace's original ideas, to a standing ovation.|$|R

The effect (certain, in any case, to be injurious to a young girl) was considerably aggravated by the state of her mind at the time.

5000|$|Braid's Account of Self-HypnotismIt is {{commonly}} said that seeing is believing, but feeling {{is the very}} truth. I shall, therefore, give the result of my experience of hypnotism in my own person. In the middle of September, 1844, I suffered from a most severe attack of rheumatism, implicating {{the left side of}} the neck and chest, and the left arm. At first the pain was moderately severe, and I <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>medicine</b> to remove it; but, instead of this, it became more and more violent, and had tormented me for three days, and was so excruciating, that it entirely deprived me of sleep for three nights successively, and on the last of the three nights I could not remain in any one posture for five minutes, from the severity of the pain. On the forenoon of the next day, whilst visiting my patients, every jolt of the carriage I could only compare to several sharp instruments being thrust through my shoulder, neck, and chest. A full inspiration was attended with stabbing pain, such as is experienced in pleurisy. When I returned home for dinner I could neither turn my head, lift my arm, nor draw a breath, without suffering extreme pain. In this condition I resolved to try the effects of hypnotism. I requested two friends, who were present, and who both understood the system, to watch the effects, and arouse me when I had passed sufficiently into the condition; and, with their assurance that they would give strict attention to their charge, I sat down and hypnotised myself, extending the extremities. At the expiration of nine minutes they aroused me, and, to my agreeable surprise, I was quite free from pain, being able to move in any way with perfect ease. I say agreeably surprised, on this account; I had seen like results with many patients; but it is one thing to hear of pain, and another to feel it. My suffering was so exquisite that I could not imagine anyone else ever suffered so intensely as myself on that occasion; and, therefore, I merely expected a mitigation, so that I was truly agreeably surprised to find myself quite free from pain. I continued quite easy all the afternoon, slept comfortably all night, and the following morning felt a little stiffness, but no pain. A week thereafter I had a slight return, which I removed by hypnotising myself once more; and I have remained quite free from rheumatism ever since, now nearly six years.|$|R

'I want the paper that I gave you in the street, last night,' she said. I asked her why she wanted it. She seemed not to know how to reply; she became excited and confused. 'To destroy it, to be sure!' she burst out suddenly. 'Every bottle my husband left is destroyed--strewed here, there, and everywhere, from the Gate to the Deadhouse. Oh, I know what you think of me--I defy you!' She seemed to forget what she had said, the moment she had said it--she turned away, and opened a drawer, and took out a book closed by metal clasps. My presence in the room appeared to be a lost perception in her mind. The clasps of the book, as well as I could make it out, opened by touching some spring. I noticed that her hands trembled as they tried to find the spring. I attributed the trembling to the terrors of the night, and offered to help her. 'Let my secrets alone,' she said--and pushed the book under the pillow of her bed. It was my professional duty to assist her, if I could. Though I attached no sort of importance to what Jack had said, I thought it desirable, before I prescribed for her, to discover whether she had really <b>taken</b> <b>some</b> <b>medicine</b> of her own or not. She staggered back from me, on my repeating what I had heard from Jack, as if I had terrified her. 'What remedy does he mean? I drank nothing but a glass of wine. Send for him directly--I must, and will speak to him!' I told her this was impossible; I could not permit his sleep to be disturbed. 'The watchman!' she cried; 'the drunken brute! send for him.' By this time I began to conclude that there was really something wrong. I called in her daughter to look after her while I was away, and then left the room to consult with Fritz. The only hope of finding Schwartz (the night-watch at the Deadhouse being over by that time) was to apply to his sister the nurse. I knew where she lived; and Fritz most kindly offered to go to her. By the time Schwartz was found, and brought to the house, Madame Fontaine was just able to understand what he said, and no more. I began to recognize the symptoms of Mr. Keller's illness. The apathy which you remember was showing itself already. 'Leave me to die,' she said quietly; 'I deserve it.' The last effort of the distracted mind, rousing for a moment the sinking body, was made almost immediately afterwards. She raised herself on the pillow, and seized my arm. 'Mind!' she said, 'Minna is to be married on the thirteenth!' Her eyes rested steadily on me, while she spoke. At the last word, she sank back, and relapsed into the condition in which you have just seen her." ...|$|R
