5|$|After {{the defeat}} at the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald {{managed to escape}} {{with the aid of}} Rögnvald Brusason (later Earl of Orkney) to a remote farm in Eastern Norway. He stayed there for some time to heal his wounds, and {{thereafter}} (possibly up to a month later) journeyed north over the mountains to Sweden. A year after the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald arrived in Kievan Rus' (referred to in the sagas as Garðaríki or Svíþjóð hin mikla). He likely spent at least part of his time in the town of Staraya Ladoga (Aldeigjuborg), arriving <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> half of 1031. Harald and his men were welcomed by Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise, whose wife Ingegerd was a distant relative of Harald. Badly in need of military leaders, Yaroslav recognised a military potential in Harald and made him a captain of his forces. Harald's brother Olaf Haraldsson had previously been in exile to Yaroslav following the revolt in 1028, and Morkinskinna says that Yaroslav embraced Harald first and foremost because he was the brother of Olaf. Harald took part in Yaroslav's campaign against the Poles in 1031, and possibly also fought against other 1030s Kievan enemies and rivals such as the Chudes in Estonia, the Byzantines, as well as the Pechenegs and other steppe nomad people.|$|E

Like them, she observes, Miranda competently assumes a position of authority often held by male characters, despite her moral failings, that she must defend against attempts to use her personal life to remove her from it, to [...] "prov, as a creature of sentiment, that she never belonged <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> place."

500|$|The Smithsonian Institution has {{categorized}} The Quest as both {{abstract and}} figurative. In 2002, journalist Sallie Tisdale of The Oregonian described the sculpture as a [...] "large tangle of snow-white bodies in a fountain".

As of 1990, The Quest was considered Portland's largest single piece of white sculptured marble. It was surveyed and considered [...] "well maintained" [...] by the Smithsonian's [...] "Save Outdoor Sculpture!" [...] program in January 1994. Maintenance on the sculpture has included caulking and repairs to the male figure's nose.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed in mid-September 2009 in Vancouver. Due to the Russian {{lettering}} {{on many of}} the episode props, director Cassar joked during shooting, [...] "Can we get a translator and find out what this writing means, specifically? Maybe it says 'Do not open until Christmas' or 'Watch The Simpsons on Sunday night,' knowing Fox." [...] To create the episode's auditory effects, sound editor Bruce Tanis explained his production steps in an interview with Designing Sound, [...] "'Earthling' was a really good episode for strange sounds. It starts out with the appearance of a smoke monster that kills its victims by enveloping them and leaving behind an exact life-like looking corpse only the body is made of ash which crumbles horribly when touched. The smoke creature moved rapidly as opposed to gently drifting so I had some movement to play off of in creating a sound for him. I came up with some stuttering, fluttery whooshes that kind of vibrated which made him more dangerous than if he sounded like a puff of steam moving along the hall. The smoke monster requires a host body to live in when he's not vibrating around killing people. The only way to recall the smoke monster to the host body, or to keep him <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> place, is by severe electrical shock." ...|$|E

500|$|The Confessions Tour {{received}} positive critical response. Steve Baltin of Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "Madonna {{had played}} many {{roles in the}} first night of her Confessions tour – but confessor was not one of them. Apparently, in all the pomp and circumstance, {{there was no room for}} warmth, or even the attitude that made her recent Coachella festival performance so memorable." [...] Don Chareunsy of The San Diego Union-Tribune commented that Madonna's previous tours, Drowned World Tour (2001) and Re-Invention World Tour (2004), [...] "were excellent concerts... but she stepped it up a few notches" [...] for the Confessions Tour. Ben Wener of The Orange County Register reported that [...] "No one – but no one – stages elaborate eye-candy productions like Madonna, whose highly impressive Confessions Tour opened Sunday night at a packed Forum so sweltering it seemed as though it were being prepped for the world's largest Bikram yoga session." [...] Lina Das from the Daily Mail complimented the show, saying that Madonna still had the ability to grab the headlines with her shock tactics. Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine complimented the finale of the tour saying, [...] "There's not a better way the Confessions Tour could’ve closed." [...] Tom Young from the BBC called the show [...] "a big fat neon light of a pop-dance explosion. There's a party going on, and unless you were <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> place, you’re not invited. Whistles and whoops rarely cease and applause ripples throughout building into regular raptures for a consistently first-class performer. It's almost enough to make those who weren’t there jealous. Almost." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some of the emigrants {{went first}} to Cyprus, {{but did not}} like the climate.

Around 6,000 emigrated <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> half of 1899, settling on land granted to them by the government in what is now Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

2500|$|The {{successful}} {{establishment of}} crops on Clarence Plains was {{vital to the}} survival of Hobart Town. When new settlers arrived from Norfolk Island in 1808, some were granted land in the Derwent Valley, and others upon Clarence Plains. Very soon a mixture of mansions and fine houses, cottages, inns and churches began to be built in the area. [...] However the population growth on the eastern shore was much slower than that of Hobart Town, despite the close proximity of the young town. By the 1810s, a ferryman was making regular crossings of the Derwent between Sullivans Cove, and 'Kangaroo Point', near where the ferry still arrives at Bellerive Quay. The point was so-called due to the large numbers of Kangaroos that would be seen grazing <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> few decades after European arrival. By the late 1810s, farmers, timbermen, and pioneers had begun settling on the eastern shore of the Derwent River.|$|E
