40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{efficacy}} of a brief cognitivebehavioral program {{that was designed to}} reduce the work-related stress levels of secondary school teachers. Methods: A quasi-experimental design was used to compare <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>groups</b> with <b>the</b> wait-list control groups. Seventy teachers from <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>groups</b> and 54 from the control groups completed a set of validated scales at the baseline and 3 - 4 wk later. The scales included the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale-Form A, the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II, and the Occupational Stress Inventory Revised Edition. Results: After controlling for the baseline measures, <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>groups</b> had significantly lower role stress, personal strain and overall work-related stress 3 - 4 wk after the baseline measurements. <b>The</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>groups</b> also had significantly higher stress management behaviors, and less general stress and dysfunctional thoughts than the control groups (all p≤ 0. 05). The levels of dysfunctional thoughts and stress management behaviors significantly predicted general stress after intervention and personal resource deficits. The level of dysfunctional thoughts also predicted the personal strain of work-related stresses (all p< 0. 05). Conclusions: The brief program reported in this study was efficacious in reducing the work-related stress of secondary teachers. Teachers experienced less work-related stress after the program, and they reported reduced dysfunctional thoughts and enhanced stress management behaviors. This program may be considered as an initial strategy for teachers to develop skills to cope with their work-related stress in the short term and could be incorporated with other strategies to achieve longer-term effects. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{evaluated the}} provision of two different one-to-one educational interventions, randomly assigned, to two separate groups of medical practitioners at a health maintenance organization (HMO), Cigna Healthplan of Tucson, Arizona. A control <b>group</b> received no <b>intervention.</b> Each <b>group</b> consisted of seven physicians and one nurse practitioner. <b>The</b> <b>intervention</b> was aimed at improving the prescribing of the anti-ulcer drugs, cimetidine, ranitidine, and sucralfate. The theoretical basis for the study involved the cognitive principle of vividness, which implies that more vivid information has greater effect on decisions. For this research, <b>the</b> vivid <b>intervention</b> included case scenarios, while <b>the</b> non-vivid <b>intervention</b> included statistical information {{of the results of}} a drug use review. Prescribing data, consisting of percentages and cost of inappropriate prescriptions, were collected for one month prior to and for two months after <b>the</b> <b>intervention.</b> Analysis of covariance was employed with the pre-intervention measures of prescribing as the covariate in each test and post-intervention measures as the dependent variables. No differences were found between <b>the</b> two <b>interventions,</b> but <b>the</b> control <b>group</b> was significantly different from <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>groups.</b> For <b>the</b> first post-intervention month, it was found that <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> resulted in significantly lower percentages of prescriptions written inappropriately for indication, dose, or duration (P = 0. 001). These percentages decreased by 36 % for <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>groups,</b> while increasing by 14 % for the control group. Costs of inappropriate prescribing per study prescription and per patient encounter were also significantly lower for <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>groups</b> than for <b>the</b> control group (P = 0. 001 and P = 0. 019, respectively). In the second post-intervention month, inappropriate prescribing increased slightly in <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>groups</b> and were no longer significantly different from the control group. The research demonstrated the effectiveness of a one-to-one educational intervention in improving drug prescribing at an HMO. The lack of differences between <b>the</b> two <b>interventions</b> may have been due to the overall effectiveness of the one-to-one educational discussion, the interpretation of the statistical information as prescribing feedback by the practitioners, or the inadequate presentation of vividness in the case scenarios...|$|R

Available {{studies indicate that}} some of the traditional postpartum practices are potentially harmful for women's health. However, no intervention study aiming at postpartum practices has been performed. In this paper we evaluated the effect of a health and nutrition education intervention, which focused on improving postpartum dietary quality and optimal health behaviors. Methods The study design was a randomized controlled trial conducted in both urban and rural area of Hubei between August 2003 and June 2004. A total of 302 women who attended the antenatal clinic during the third trimester with an uncomplicated pregnancy were recruited. Women randomized to <b>the</b> education <b>intervention</b> <b>group</b> in both urban and rural area received two two-hour prenatal education sessions and four postpartum counseling visits. Control group women received usual health care during pregnancy and postpartum period. Women were followed up until 42 days postpartum. Outcome measures were nutrition and health knowledge, dietary behavior, health behavior and health problems during the postpartum period. Results Women in <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>groups</b> exhibited significantly greater improvement in overall dietary behaviors such as consumption of fruits, vegetables, soybean and soybean products as well as nutrition and health knowledge than those in the control groups. Significantly more women in <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>groups</b> give up <b>the</b> traditional behavior taboos. The incidence of constipation, leg cramp or joint pain and prolonged lochia rubra was significantly lower in <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>groups</b> as compared with the control groups.
