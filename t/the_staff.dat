40|$|Background and {{discussion}} of the problem: In <b>the</b> <b>staffing</b> company business a unique situation exists because of the three part relation between <b>the</b> <b>staffing</b> company, <b>the</b> users of <b>the</b> <b>staffing</b> companies’ services, and the consultants employed by <b>the</b> <b>staffing</b> company. To over bridge the conflicting objectives of <b>the</b> <b>staffing</b> company and <b>the</b> consultant incentive systems are designed. Research question: What effects on the consultants’ effort direction do <b>the</b> <b>staffing</b> managers expect of the formal or informal incentive system? Method: The authors have found that a suitable method for the thesis is a survey study. Four different staffing companies were selected as case-study objects, and hence the empirical chapter is {{based on interviews with}} <b>staffing</b> managers at <b>the</b> selected companies. The information gathered from the interviews is analyzed with help from the theoretical framework. Results: The authors found that effort directing difficulties do not exist in the studied companies. The {{reason for this is that}} <b>the</b> <b>staffing</b> companies have a recruitment process which determines who fits in the company’s profile or who do not. The authors are also convinced that the reason to why staffing companies do not consider consultants’ effort direction as a problem is that <b>the</b> <b>staffing</b> company, <b>the</b> consultant, and even the client has aligning interests. The consultants will by <b>the</b> <b>staffing</b> company be given the possibility to develop their competences. The client will in that way get more qualified consultants with better skills. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>staffing</b> company will be able to take a higher charge for a more skilled consultant. Another reason to why effort directing difficulties do not exist is frequent connection between <b>the</b> <b>staffing</b> manager, <b>the</b> consultant, and the client company. The close connection makes it possible to correct failures and undesirable behavior of the consultants. Suggestions to further research: The authors would find it interesting if further research would be done within this field, and in that case the number of interviewed companies and/or the number of interviewed people within the same corporation would be larger. Furthermore it would be worthwhile to investigate the consultants’ view on what they think is motivating them to align their effort in a specific direction...|$|R

5|$|Following the crisis, the Colonel Director of Retainers {{retained}} his privileged {{possession of}} <b>the</b> <b>Staff</b> of Authority and was granted the same investigative and censorial powers as the Chancellor and Imperial Counselor over officialdom.

The Colonel Director of Retainers was a personal servant of the emperor, answering only to him, allowing the emperor to greatly enhance his control over the bureaucracy. However, <b>the</b> <b>Staff</b> of Authority was removed from the Colonel in 45 BC, limiting his powers to inspection, investigation, and impeachment and he was distinguished from a provincial Inspector only by a higher salary-rank. The office of Colonel Director of Retainers was abolished in 9 BC, and reinstated once more as the Director of Retainers in 7 BC. He was now a subordinate of the new Excellency of Works and supervised convicts in public works projects, like his early Western Han counterpart. In Eastern Han, the Colonel Director of Retainers was reappointed without <b>the</b> <b>Staff</b> of Authority, with powers to inspect the capital region, but his salary-rank was reduced from 2000–dan to Equivalent to 2000–dan.|$|E
