5|$|Inertial {{confinement}} fusionis one of {{two major}} lines of fusion power development, the other being magnetic confinement fusion (MCF), notably the tokamak concept which is being built in a major experimental system known as ITER. Magnetic confinement is widely {{considered to be the}} superior approach, and has seen significantly greater development activity over the decades. However, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>serious</b> concerns that the MCF approach of ITER cannot ever become economically practical.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{indicate}} that 12–17% of {{adolescents and young}} adults with autism satisfy diagnostic criteria for catatonia, which is loss of or hyperactive motor activity. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been used to treat cases of catatonia and related conditions in people with autism.

25|$|The serious {{nature of}} Hudson's medical condition...raises a strong {{possibility}} {{that it was a}} factor contributing to the collision of February 8...The Commission therefore concludes that Hudson's medical condition possibly contributed to his failure to control Train 413. The Commission also concludes that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>serious</b> deficiencies {{in the manner in which}} CN monitored and reacted to that condition. The Commission finds that both the policies and procedures that permitted a man in Hudson's medical state to be responsible for the operation of a freight train on the CN main line to be unacceptable.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>serious</b> {{difficulties}} {{arising from}} {{the structure of the}} Poisson brackets involving the spatial diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraints. In particular, the algebra of (smeared) Hamiltonian constraints does not close, it is proportional to a sum over infinitesimal spatial diffeomorphisms (which, as we have just noted, does not exist in the quantum theory) where the coefficients of proportionality are not constants but have non-trivial phase space dependence – as such it does not form a Lie algebra. However, the situation is much improved by the introduction of the master constraint.|$|E

25|$|However, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>serious</b> {{doubts about}} the used methods and the {{interpretation}} of the results, especially the use of 0.5 as cut-off point for the effect-size. A complete reanalysis and recalculation based on the same FDA data discovered that the Kirsch study suffered from important flaws in the calculations. The authors concluded that although {{a large percentage of the}} placebo response was due to expectancy, this was not true for the active drug. Besides confirming drug effectiveness, they found that the drug effect was not related to depression severity.|$|E
25|$|The Carnation {{revolution}} of 1974, effectively a bloodless left-wing military coup, installed the Third Republic, and broad democratic reforms were {{implemented in the}} country's government. With Portugal's admission to the European Union in 1986, plans to rehouse the huge population living in deprived {{areas of the city}} emerged. There are now fewer slums in the capital and its environs, although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>serious</b> problems in those that remain. But even these, such as Mouraria, have seen changes. In 1988, a fire near the historical centre of Chiado greatly disrupted normal life in the area for about 10 years. Another boost to Lisbon's international standing was Expo 98 which opened up a new space in the capital, the Parque das Nações (Park of Nations).|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>serious</b> and {{controversial}} issues about {{differences in the}} situation of women with different races and ethnicities in Brazil. As a whole, black and Amerindian women enjoy considerably less quality of life than white women, with this being {{a reflection of the}} general characteristics of the social and economic gap that has separated social classes in Brazil for centuries, thus not indicating any specific problem about gender and women's rights. Black women's life expectancy in 2004 was 69.52 years, while white women could expect to live 73.80 on average. However, there is, at least apparently, no legal or institutional circumstance that generates those ethnic differences, but lower standards of life have always been related to a much larger percentage of mulatto, black and Amerindian people in Brazil, as in many other countries. In the last years, there is a tendency of soft decrease in Brazil's racial inequality.|$|E

25|$|At Central Station, the new {{dedicated}} U9 platform {{would be}} placed underneath the current S-Bahn platforms but above U4/U5 platform and new second S-Bahn platforms, and underneath the heavy rail tracks. This could allow for a mezzanine level above the U9 platform to connect not only to other U- and S-Bahn lines, but to the western ends of the heavy rail platforms {{including those of the}} heavy rail annexes which flank the main platforms of the central station, meaning improved connections in particular of the annexes. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>serious</b> engineering and design challenges in building a fifth line under the Central Station if quick transfers with the existing two S-Bahn lines and two U-Bahn lines are to be achieved. Possible cost increases from technical challenges at Münchner Freiheit, where the U9 was to have rejoined the U3/U6 line in an earlier proposal for the line, have been mitigated by having the line reconnect one station south at Giselastraße instead.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the health}} {{services}} that exist, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>serious</b> problems and deficiencies. As of 1997, life expectancy {{in the state}} was 71.5 years, 9 years higher than in 1990. The death rate has decreased from 5.79 deaths per thousand to 5.14. While much of Mexico's health care system struggles to meet needs, the system in Oaxaca, one of the country's poorest states, has it particularly bad. The relatively prosperous state of Nuevo León has 3,207 hospital beds, while Oaxaca has only 1,760, {{despite the fact that}} the two states have about the same population. There is about the same ratio of doctors between the two states. Forty four percent of pregnant women receive pre-natal care from people who are not medically qualified. 70 women each year die from complications from pregnancy and childbirth, and most of these are avoidable, due to bleeding and eclampsia. For every 100,000 live births in Oaxaca, there are 95.1 maternal deaths, over the national average of 63.3, putting the state in the top five.|$|E
500|$|Carman—the QC {{recruited}} by Bolton—was the last {{contributor to the}} documentary. Presented with This Week evidence, he disagreed with Margaret Thatcher's statement that the inquest would be sufficient to establish {{the facts of the}} incident. He opined that a more powerful judicial enquiry, possibly headed by a British High Court judge, would be better equipped to eliminate the inconsistencies between the official version of events and the eyewitness statements. In conclusion, Manyon asked Carman [...] "do you believe this case is so important that the government should take such extraordinary steps in order to clarify the facts?" [...] Carman responded [...] "the programme indicates <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>serious,</b> important public issues involved, and speaking as a lawyer, one is always anxious when there is contest on the facts in such important areas, they should be properly and efficiently investigated". The documentary closed with Jonathan Dimbleby: ...|$|E

500|$|Despite its inaccuracies, the Beviss account had {{a strong}} {{influence}} over the story. For many years, both John Chipp Hamp and Geharty figured prominently in retellings of the massacre. According to several accounts, Hamp's son was also involved in spreading {{the story of his}} father's death, including the story of the head in the camp oven, and that {{he was the one who}} discovered the body. Geharty was also mentioned by a number of those that told the story, but again, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>serious</b> questions about the accuracy of his statements. In 1932, a version of the story was told in The Advertiser in which a party of 200 bushmen drove a group of Aboriginal people to the cliffs, but there was possibly only one victim. The writer claimed he had been told this by Geharty. However, from 1926 onwards, most accounts of the massacre usually referred to the archival and newspaper record and noted that there was no evidence for a massacre on the scale of that claimed by Congreve, Beviss or John Chipp Hamp. In 1936, the historian James Dugald Somerville wrote a series of articles in the Port Lincoln Times regarding early settler life on the Eyre Peninsula, in which he concluded that [...] "it is a certainty that the Waterloo Bay 'massacre', as pictured by H.J.C. ,.. A. Beviss and others did not occur, and that the natives did not cut the head off Hamps' body and place it in the camp oven".|$|E
