5|$|Palladium is a metal {{with low}} toxicity. It is poorly absorbed by human body when digested. Plants {{such as the}} water {{hyacinth}} are killed by low levels of palladium salts, but most other plants <b>tolerate</b> <b>it,</b> although tests show that, at levels above 0.0003%, growth is affected. High doses of palladium could be poisonous; tests on rodents suggest it may be carcinogenic, though no clear evidence indicates the element harms humans.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{eventually}} follow Evan to Congress. When Long discovers this, {{he allows}} Evan latitude at first, but warns {{him that he}} will no longer <b>tolerate</b> <b>it</b> if it happens again in the future. Meanwhile, Evan's staffers are outraged by his change of appearance and behavior. When Evan returns to the ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells Evan that the flood will likely come at mid-day on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God has been talking to him and is responsible for his new look and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but he soon realizes that God will not allow him {{to take it off}} and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later. The next time Evan arrives at Congress for work, animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into his robe halfway through the session. Evan reluctantly explains his divine mission, although Long does not take him seriously, and Evan is fired from Congress and later removed his name from the Public Land Act bill. Evan deduces that God purposely had him fired from Congress, so that he would have more time to build the ark. In continued skepticism, Joan leaves Evan alone after believing that he was going insane.|$|E
25|$|Several hundred {{thousand}} women served in combat roles, especially in anti-aircraft units. The U.S. {{decided not to}} use women in combat because public opinion would not <b>tolerate</b> <b>it.</b> However 400,000 women served in uniform in non-combat roles in the U.S. armed forces; 160,000 were killed by enemy fire.|$|E

2500|$|Prevention {{involves}} avoiding loud noise. If {{there is}} an underlying cause, treating it may lead to improvements. Otherwise, typically, management involves talk therapy. Sound generators or hearing aids may help some. As of 2013, there were no effective medications. It is common, affecting about 10–15% of people. Most, however, <b>tolerate</b> <b>it</b> well, {{and it is a}} significant problem in only 1–2% of people. The word tinnitus is from the Latin [...] which means [...] "to ring".|$|E
2500|$|The {{evolution}} of purple bacteria, {{which do not}} produce or use oxygen but can <b>tolerate</b> <b>it,</b> enabled mats to colonize areas that locally had relatively high concentrations of oxygen, which is toxic to organisms that are not adapted to it. [...] Microbial mats would have been separated into oxidized and reduced layers, and this specialization would have increased their productivity. It {{may be possible to}} confirm this model by analyzing the isotope ratios of both carbon and sulfur in sediments laid down in shallow water.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Sandra Day O'Connor filed a {{concurring opinion}} {{in which she}} offered a {{different}} rationale for invalidating the Texas sodomy statute. She disagreed with the overturning of Bowers—she {{had been in the}} Bowers majority—and disputed the court's invocation of due process guarantees of liberty in this context. Rather than including sexuality under protected liberty, she would strike down the law as violating the equal protection clause because it criminalized male-male but not male-female sodomy. O'Connor maintained that a sodomy law that was neutral both in effect and application might be constitutional, but that there was little to fear because [...] "democratic society" [...] would not <b>tolerate</b> <b>it</b> for long. O'Connor noted that a law limiting marriage to heterosexual couples would pass the rational scrutiny {{as long as it was}} designed to [...] "preserv the traditional institution of marriage" [...] and not simply based on the state's dislike of homosexual persons.|$|E
2500|$|Procopius narrates: [...] "The plague which I {{mentioned}} in the previous narrative was ravaging the population of Byzantium. And the Emperor Justinian was taken very seriously ill, {{so that it was}} even reported that he had died. And this report was circulated by rumour and was carried as far as the Roman army. There some of the commanders began to say that, if the Romans should set up a second Justinian as Emperor over them in Byzantium, they would never <b>tolerate</b> <b>it.</b> But a little later it so fell out that the Emperor recovered, and the commanders of the Roman army began to slander one another. For Peter the General and John whom they called the Glutton declared that they had heard Belisarius and Bouzes say those things which I have just mentioned. The Empress Theodora, declaring that these slighting things which the men had said were directed against her, became quite out of patience. So she straightway summoned them all to Byzantium and made an investigation of the report." ...|$|E

The company released a statement on May 19, 2010: [...] "While the content does not violate our terms, we do understand it may not be legal in some countries. We are investigating this. In cases like this, the approach is sometimes to restrict certain content from being shown in specific countries." [...] The Jakarta Globe reported that several Muslim religious scholars in Indonesia were critical of Facebook in light of the protest movement. Rohadi Abdul Fatah the Indonesia, Religious Affairs Ministry director of Islam and Shariah Law, announced that Facebook was to be considered haram (forbidden) according to Muslim law. Rohadi Abdul Fatah stated, [...] "We cannot <b>tolerate</b> <b>it.</b> Those who created the account were extremely irresponsible." [...] Indonesia Communication and Information Minister Tifatul Sembiring stated to The Jakarta Globe, [...] "I consider this an act of provocation to mess up religious harmony enjoyed by Indonesians. I call on everybody to stay calm. Let us all just cool down." [...] Sembiring stated his intention to write the management of Facebook, and noted, [...] "Removing it is useless because other party can just post it again on the account. Therefore, we all {{need to be aware of}} this." ...|$|E

However susceptible to flattery William might be, he would never <b>tolerate</b> <b>it</b> from people who showed a gross or emotional taste in literature, and if Cassandra erred even slightly from what he considered essential in this respect he would express his discomfort by flinging out his hands and wrinkling his forehead; he would find no pleasure in her flattery after that.|$|E

60|$|At {{that time}} the army {{was held in the}} {{greatest}} dislike by the English people. The nation had always been opposed to a standing force, and it was only now that the necessities of the country induced them to <b>tolerate</b> <b>it.</b> It was, however, recruited almost entirely from reckless and desperate men. Criminals were allowed to commute sentences of imprisonment for service in the army, and the gates of the prisons were also opened to insolvent debtors consenting to enlist. But all the efforts of the recruiting sergeants, aided by such measures as these, proved insufficient to attract a sufficient number of men to keep up the armies at the required strength.|$|E
60|$|This {{practice}} {{seems to}} us very absurd; and we wonder that the Roman people should <b>tolerate</b> <b>it,</b> since {{it is evident that}} the means for defraying these expenses must come, ultimately, in some way or other, from them. And yet, absurd as it seems, this sort of policy is not wholly disused even in our day. The operas and the theaters, and other similar establishments in France, are sustained, in part, by the government; and the liberality and efficiency with which this is done, forms, in some degree, the basis of the popularity of each succeeding administration. The plan is better systematized and regulated in our day, but it is, in its nature, substantially the same.|$|E

It simply never occurred to Mary Isabel to do so; all her life she had given in to Louisa {{and the thought of}} refusing obedience to her sister's Mede-and-Persian decrees never crossed her mind. Mary Isabel had only one secret from Louisa and she lived in daily dread that Louisa would discover it. It was a very harmless little secret, but Mary Isabel felt rightly sure that Louisa would not <b>tolerate</b> <b>it</b> for a moment.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the other}} service academies' honor codes, the Honor Concept allows a {{midshipman}} to confront someone committing an honor violation without formally reporting it.
