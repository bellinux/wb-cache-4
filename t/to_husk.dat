25|$|It transpires that Husk's {{personality}} {{shifts and}} subsequent mental breakdown and betrayal where {{caused by a}} secondary mutation which means her powers now also affect her mind {{as well as her}} body. Husk is forgiven for her betrayal since she was of unsound mind and is made the Academy's new guidance counselor, however Toad is fired. As he is leaving Husk apologizes to him for being unable to remember what happened between them, he claims he knew it was too good to last. Before he leaves she arranges a date at a local coffee shop, but the city is attacked by self-replicating energy bots built by Maximilian Frankenstein so he and Manuel Endque could escape the Grey Academy. The X-Men defeat the robots, and half the coffee shop has been destroyed. Endque was found by the X-Men having been severely beaten by Toad on Frankenstein's orders, Toad seemingly now working for Frankenstein, wanting to go someplace nobody can hurt them. Endque passes on a message <b>to</b> <b>Husk</b> that Toad left because he knew even if things went well between them one day she'd wake up and see him for what he really was. Husk breaks down in tears.|$|E
500|$|Gates {{was raised}} on the family's farm, but did not care for farm life. [...] At an early age, he entered into his first {{business}} proposition: <b>to</b> <b>husk</b> a neighbor's corn. His next business venture was to clear some land of timber for another neighbor. [...] Gates earned US$1,000 for this job, selling the timber as firewood to homes and to the railroad. Gates then took the money from this labor and bought a half interest in a threshing machine. As this type of equipment was very new at the time, few farms owned one, so Gates and his partner hired themselves out to work with it at various local farms. After one season, Gates tired {{of this type of}} work and he sold his interest in the threshing machine to his partner and another friend. Gates then set himself up as a local grain broker, doing business from the family's home. [...] This business venture was a failure; in an effort to escape farm work, he took to spending time at the railroad depot where he had previously sold firewood. The railroad men remembered him and now asked him to join their poker games. [...] Gates found he had an aptitude for the game and for anticipating the cards men held and how they would play them. [...] With the grain brokerage now forgotten, he was able to make up the losses at the card table.|$|E
2500|$|Husk {{has been}} able to shift into {{anything}} that does not exceed her body mass. Any extra mass left when she shifts into a smaller form such as an insect or a bird is shunted into an unknown extra-dimensional space, and will return <b>to</b> <b>Husk</b> when she resumes her human form. However, she has also demonstrated an ability to take on extra mass and become heavier. [...] She has the capability to blend in with surroundings, but in order to do so, she would have to study the texture she seeks to mimic first. [...] She can husk away minor injuries, but deeper ones will stay with her. She can hold a form for about an hour before she needs to revert to her original form. She can morph repeatedly. She is not required to stay in any one form, but too many transformations can become very painful. In great stress or trauma, Paige can shed without control, revealing patchwork forms. When Paige 'husks', she sheds her clothing as well, this has the side effect of leaving her nude when she returns to her normal form.|$|E

40|$|Efficient rice {{marketing}} {{is one of}} the most important factors in determining the rural economy of Bangladesh. This study focuses on the standard of living of rice farmers, production structure, rice selling, marketing channel, rice prices, profit by intermediaries, marketing efficiency and farmers` attitudes towards marketing. The study is based on data collected through a survey of 33 farmers and 25 intermediaries carried out during July to August 2003 in Jhikargacha Upazila in Jessore district, south-western part of Bangladesh. In the surveyed area six types of middlemen and eighteen types of major marketing channels were identified. The study found that 27 (82 %) farmers sold exclusively unhusked rice and only 6 (18 %) farmers sold partially husked rice. The quantity of unhusked rice sold to wholesalers of unhusked rice, stockists, huskers and village merchants were 3297 and 14 %, respectively. Although, among all eighteen channels <b>husked</b> rice selling <b>to</b> retailers of <b>husked</b> rice was observed to be the best channel, only 3 % of unhusked rice was converted <b>to</b> <b>husked</b> rice and sold through this channel. Husked rice sold through wholesalers of husked rice was also found to be a comparatively efficient channel, but only 5 % of unhusked rice was converted <b>to</b> <b>husked</b> rice and sold through this channel. The study found that the marketing of rice in the surveyed area was not efficient. It is argued that because of the limits on alternative ways of improving the conditions of the farmers and as rice {{is one of the}} main sources of income, its efficient {{marketing is}} essential for increasing their income and that will ultimately be helpful for improving the living standard...|$|R
