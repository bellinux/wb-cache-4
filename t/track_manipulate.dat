These choreographies could include spectators too, providing them with the possibility to directly modify the scene and its audio/visual features. We also introduce the first interactive performance staged with this technology, in which an electronic musician played live five <b>tracks</b> <b>manipulating</b> the 3 D projected visuals. As questionnaires have been distributed after the show, in {{the last part of}} this work we discuss the analysis of collected data, underlining positive and negative aspects of the proposed experience. This paper belongs together with a performance proposal called Dissonance, in which two performers exploit the platform to create a progressive soundtrack along with the exploration of an interactive virtual environment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generic video coding algorithm allowing the content-based manipulation of objects. This manipulation is possible {{thanks to the}} definition of a spatiotemporal segmentation of the sequences. The coding strategy relies on a joint optimization in the rate-distortion sense of the partition definition and of the coding techniques to be used within each region. This optimization creates the link between the analysis and synthesis parts of the coder. The analysis defines the time evolution of the partition, as well as the elimination or the appearance of regions that are homogeneous either spatially or in motion. The coding of the texture {{as well as of the}} partition relies on region-based motion compensation techniques.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a nonlinear bearing-only target tracking problem using three di#erent methods and compare their performances. The study {{is motivated by}} a ground surveillance problem where a target is tracked from an airborne sensor at an approximately known altitude using depression angle observations. Two nonlinear suboptimal estimators, namely, the extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the pseudomeasurement tracking filter are applied in a 2 -D bearing-only tracking scenario. The EKF {{is based on the}} linearization of the nonlinearities in the dynamic and/or the measurement equations.

The performances of these three di#erent techniques in terms of accuracy and computational load are presented in this paper. The results demonstrate the limitations of these algorithms on this deceptively simple tracking problem...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Cardiac {{catheters}} allow {{physicians to}} access {{the inside of the}} heart and perform therapeutic interventions without stopping the heart or opening the chest. However, conventional manual and actuated cardiac catheters are currently unable to precisely <b>track</b> and <b>manipulate</b> the intracardiac tissue structures because of the fast tissue motion and potential for applying damaging forces. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing and implementing a robotic catheter system that use 3 D ultrasound image guidance and force control to enable constant contact with a moving target surface in order to perform interventional procedures, such as intracardiac tissue ablation. The robotic catheter system, consisting of a catheter module, ablation and force sensing end effector, drive system, and image-guidance and control system, was commanded to apply a constant force against a moving target using a position-modulated force control method. The control system uses a combination of position tracking, force feedback, and friction and backlash compensation to achieve accurate and safe catheter-tissue interactions. The catheter was able to maintain a 1 N force on a moving motion simulator target under ultrasound guidance with 0. 08 N RMS error. In a simulated ablation experiment, the robotic catheter was also able to apply a consistent force on the target whil...|$|R
40|$|The copy {{of record}} is {{available}} at IET Digital Library: [URL] Copyright IET [Full text {{of this paper is}} not available in the UHRA]The Gigabit-capable passive optical network (GPON) has become an attractive and promising solution for the broadband access network. In this paper a novel dynamic bandwidth assignment protocol is proposed to both facilitate the efficient sharing of the upstream channel resource and support differentiated services over GPON. A new concept for the optical network unit bandwidth reporting procedure is developed instead of the conventional reporting of current queue status. The development of a balance transferring enables a bandwidth register and transfer mechanism in which the reported but bandwidth-unassigned requirements from previous allocations can be <b>tracked</b> and <b>manipulated</b> at the optical line termination. Dynamic bandwidth compensation is achieved through the balance transferring mechanism. The combination of the new reporting procedure and the balance transferring mechanism is incorporated into a prioritised resource allocation to accommodate differentiated services. It also efficiently supports the operation of the GPON encapsulation method. Fairness is supported by a proportional allocation scheme among various demands from different customers.

Here we use a new method to study the natural dispersal by large rodents such as agoutis; <b>tracking</b> experimentally <b>manipulated</b> and tagged fruits containing individually marked seeds. Fruit manipulation did not deter agoutis from handling fruits. We found that agoutis usually moved intact fruits away from their original location below the parent tree before either hiding them or gnawing through the pericarp to access the seeds inside. Most fruits were moved to distances of 15 â€“ 30 m from their original position, but some fruits could be taken as far as 60 m. A large number of seeds extracted from manipulated fruits appeared to be eaten immediately. Only 27 out of 1740 experimental seeds were found buried in shallow caches, generally within 5 m of the opened fruit. Fruit removal distance accounted for a disproportionate amount of total seed movement and seeds {{in the current study}} were dispersed significantly farther than in a previous experiment using exposed seeds, suggesting that classic dispersal experiments of this character may severely underestimate seed dispersal distances. We therefore conclude that the new method provides a more realistic and accurate approach to investigate natural seed dispersal of Brazil nuts and that the removal of fruits from underneath parent trees before being opened {{is the key to the}} significantly increased distances at which seeds are dispersed...|$|R

Using static (color) and dynamic (motion between frames) information, the contour is then tracked with an algorithm based on neural gas networks in the sequence of images. Experiments performed under different conditions reveal that the method tracks accurately the test objects even for severe contour deformations, is fast and insensitive to smooth changes in lighting, contrast and background...|$|R
