At least two of them insulted him publicly, and even took advantage of Simplicia Jiménez's mental health to have her harass her husband systematically.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{participated in}} the Battle of Princeton on January 3, 1777. After an initial setback, Washington rallied the American troops and led them in a {{successful}} charge against the British forces. After making a brief stand, the British fell back, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them fire upon the building. <b>Then</b> <b>some</b> Americans rushed the front door, and broke it down. The British subsequently put a white flag outside one of the windows. 194 British soldiers {{walked out of the}} building and laid down their arms, thus ending the battle in an American victory.|$|E
5|$|However, if a {{preference}} set is non-convex, <b>then</b> <b>some</b> prices determine a budget-line that supports two separate optimal-baskets. For example, {{we can imagine}} that, for zoos, a lion costs {{as much as an}} eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase half of an eagle and half of a lion (or a griffin)! Thus, the zoo-keeper's preferences are non-convex: The zoo-keeper prefers having either animal to having any strictly convex combination of both.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a termite begins with an egg, but is {{different}} from that of a bee or ant in that it goes through a developmental process called incomplete metamorphosis, with egg, nymph and adult stages. Nymphs resemble small adults, and go through a series of moults as they grow. In some species, eggs go through four moulting stages and nymphs go through three. Nymphs first moult into workers, and <b>then</b> <b>some</b> workers go through further moulting and become soldiers or alates; workers become alates only by moulting into alate nymphs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the edge}} of town, the 55th Regiment {{received}} orders from Mawhood to fall back and join the 40th Regiment in town. The 40th had taken up a position just outside town, {{on the north side}} of a ravine. The 55th formed up to the left of the 40th. The 55th sent a platoon to flank the oncoming Americans, but it was cut to pieces. When Sullivan sent several regiments to scale the ravine, they fell back to a breastwork. After making a brief stand, the British fell back again, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Alexander Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them blast away at the building. <b>Then</b> <b>some</b> Americans rushed the front door, broke it down, and the British put a white flag outside one of the windows. Exactly 194 British soldiers walked out of the building and laid down their arms.|$|E
5|$|Carr also theorizes {{that the}} {{capacity}} to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain {{of much of the}} painstaking knowledge work — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor's management system for industrial efficiency, Carr makes the point that back <b>then</b> <b>some</b> workers complained that they felt they were becoming mere automatons due to the systemic application of Taylorism — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the album}} had been {{composed}} and committed to demo form before the band arrived at Rundgren's studio, but the producer felt that the first crop was insufficient. He expected a full working album worth of songs to be ready, whereas the Furs believed that their creative process had always flourished best inside a studio. He postponed recording while the Furs made additional demos. British keyboardist and future music producer Ed Buller helped to create many of the demos made before the band returned. Although never an official member of the Furs, Buller supplied much-needed musical accompaniment at this stage, and {{would go on to}} collaborate frequently with the band over the next six years. When the second batch arrived, Rundgren made major revisions and even dropped some tracks entirely. By necessity <b>then,</b> <b>some</b> songs were revised or fully composed in the studio.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1877, {{the first of}} many related species from the region described until the 1910s. In 1918, Edward Alphonso Goldman consolidated most into the single species Oryzomys couesi and in 1960 Raymond Hall united this taxon with its United States relative, the marsh rice rat (O.palustris), into a single widespread species; subsequently, many related, localized species retained by Goldman were also included in this taxon. After studies of the contact zone in Texas, where O.couesi and the marsh rice rat meet, were published in 1979 and underscored the distinctness of the two, they were again regarded as separate. Since <b>then,</b> <b>some</b> of the peripheral forms of the group, such as Oryzomys antillarum from Jamaica and Oryzomys peninsulae from the Baja California Peninsula, have been reinstated as species. Nevertheless, O.couesi as currently constituted is likely a composite of several species; a 2010 study, using DNA sequence data, found evidence to recognize separate species from the Pacific and eastern sides of the distribution of O.couesi and two additional species from Panama and Costa Rica. Generally, Oryzomys couesi is common and of no conservation concern, and it is even considered a plague species in places, but some populations are threatened.|$|E
5|$|This {{brings the}} issue of the mysterious origin of the Wielbark culture, and why it so {{immediately}} replaced the Oksywie culture. According to the legend quoted in The Origin and Deeds of the Goths by the 6th century Gothic historian Jordanes, the ancestors of that Germanic tribe arrived from Scandinavia (under King Berig) in two boatloads and landed on the South Baltic shores, followed by a third boat carrying the ancestors of the Gepids. Supposedly they conquered the native people of that region, and <b>then,</b> <b>some</b> years later (under King Filimer, the fifth one counting from Berig), continued their migration toward the Black Sea. This story, in the past dismissed, is now seen as containing basic elements of the true sequence of events and the Wielbark culture is in part identified with Germanic ancestors of the Goths indeed. The idea of an arrival in the mouth of the Vistula region of culturally different (although related) people, who mixed with the Oksywie culture population, and being more advanced possibly dominated it (at least culturally) to some degree, is not at odds with the state of archeological findings and may explain the change of cultures in Pomerania around 30 AD.|$|E

5|$|This list {{contains}} the 62churches {{cared for by}} the Churches Conservation Trust in South West England, covering the counties of Bristol, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall. The majority are rural village churches, often with declining populations. In one extreme case at Imber in Wiltshire, part of the British Army's training grounds on the Salisbury Plain, the entire civilian population was evicted in 1943 to provide an exercise area for American troops preparing for the invasion of Europe during the Second World War. Non-military access to the Church of St Giles has been limited to several open days a year since <b>then.</b> <b>Some</b> of the churches are in major centres of population, such as St Martin's Church in Exeter and the Church of St John the Baptist in Bristol. Many of the churches are built on the sites of earlier places of worship, but the oldest building in the list is the Old Church of St Nicholas at Uphill, Somerset, which is largely roofless but is still occasionally used for services. The most recent is St Mary's Church in South Tidworth, Wiltshire, which was built in 1878. Some of the buildings, such as St Mary's Church in Wilton, Wiltshire, are partially ruined, but many have impressive interiors, often dating back several hundred years. St John the Baptist Church in Inglesham, Wiltshire, has wall paintings and other churches have highly decorated pulpits or reredos. Many still host Anglican services, but others are used by different denominations or have been converted for secular use. St Thomas à Becket Church in Pensford, Somerset, has {{been converted into a}} private house, however the tower remains in the care of the trust. St Paul's Church in Bristol is now used as a performance space and circus skills school, Circomedia, but remains consecrated.|$|E
