5|$|There were {{attempts}} to revive garage rock and elements of punk in the 1980s and 1990s, and by 2000, scenes {{had grown up}} {{as part of the}} alternative and indie music scenes in several countries. The Detroit rock scene included the White Stripes, the Von Bondies, Electric Six, the Dirtbombs, the Go, the Muggs, the Hard Lessons, Tally Hall and the Detroit Cobras. The city was also a crucial stomping ground for Ohio's the Black Keys. New York's scene included the Strokes, Interpol, Radio 4, Liars, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, TV on the Radio and <b>the</b> <b>Rapture.</b> In Los Angeles & San Francisco, the scene was centered around Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, the Brian Jonestown Massacre, the Dandy Warhols and the Warlocks (most of whom would later be more associated with underground psychedelic rock than the mainstream garage rock bands of the era), while bands like Silversun Pickups delivered a more poppy take on post-punk. Billy Childish and the Buff Medways from the United Kingdom, the (International) Noise Conspiracy from Sweden, and the 5.6.7.8's from Japan enjoyed underground, regional or national success.|$|E

25|$|Christian countercult {{activism}} stems {{mainly from}} evangelicalism or fundamentalism. The countercult movement asserts that particular Christian sects whose beliefs they deem to be partially or wholly not {{in accordance with}} the Bible are erroneous. It also states that a religious sect can be considered a cult if its beliefs involve a denial of what they view as any of the essential Christian teachings such as salvation, the Trinity, Jesus himself as a person, the ministry and miracles of Jesus, his crucifixion, his resurrection, the Second Coming and <b>the</b> <b>Rapture.</b>|$|E
25|$|Historic, or Classic Premillennialism is distinctively non-dispensational. This {{means that}} it sees no radical {{theological}} distinction between Israel and the Church. It is often post-tribulational, meaning that <b>the</b> <b>rapture</b> of the church will occur {{after a period of}} tribulation. Historic premillennialism maintains chiliasm because of its view that the church will be caught up to meet Christ in the air and then escort him to the earth in order to share in his literal thousand year rule. Proponents of the view include Charles Spurgeon and George Eldon Ladd.|$|E
