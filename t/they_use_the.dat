5|$|Many {{millipede}} {{species have}} commensal relationships with mites of the orders Mesostigmata and Astigmata. Many of these mites {{are believed to}} be phoretic rather than parasitic, which means that <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> millipede host as a means of dispersal.|$|E

5|$|All these {{distributions}} have no or {{only minor}} changes {{when compared with}} the original FreeBSD base system. The main difference to the original FreeBSD is that they come with pre-installed and pre-configured software for specific use cases. This can be compared with Linux distributions, which are all binary compatible because <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> same kernel and also use the same basic tools, compilers and libraries, while coming with different applications, configurations and branding.|$|E

5|$|Sponges {{have three}} asexual methods of reproduction: after fragmentation; by budding; and by {{producing}} gemmules. Fragments of sponges may be detached by currents or waves. <b>They</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> mobility of their pinacocytes and choanocytes and reshaping of the mesohyl to re-attach {{themselves to a}} suitable surface and then rebuild themselves as small but functional sponges {{over the course of}} several days. The same capabilities enable sponges that have been squeezed through a fine cloth to regenerate. A sponge fragment can only regenerate if it contains both collencytes to produce mesohyl and archeocytes to produce all the other cell types. A very few species reproduce by budding.|$|E
5|$|The ideal {{habitat for}} these rabbits {{is in an}} area between mature and young forests. <b>They</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> dense mature forests as {{protection}} and {{for the presence of}} pampas grass, in the summer, and acorns, in the winter, for their diets. They also use the high density of perennial grasses and herbaceous ground cover in the young forests for their diets during different times of the year. Therefore, the best habitat for them to live in is where they have easy access to both young and mature forests with no obstructions between the two forest types.|$|E

5|$|A complex courting ritual {{performed}} underwater characterises the crested and marbled newts. Males are territorial and use leks, or courtship arenas, small {{patches of}} clear ground where they display and attract females. When they encounter other males, <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> same postures as described below for courting to impress their counterpart. Occasionally, they even bite each other; marbled newts seem {{more aggressive than}} crested newts. Males also frequently disturb the courting of other males and try to guide the female away from their rival. Pheromones are used to attract females, and once a male has found one he will pursue her and position {{himself in front of}} her. After this first orientation phase, courtship proceeds with display and spermatophore transfer.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{communicate}} with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail {{on the way back to}} the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.|$|E
5|$|As {{viewed by}} the Catholic Church, Baptism {{is the first of}} three sacraments of {{initiation}} as a Christian. It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins. It makes a person a member of the Church. As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit {{on the part of the}} person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children, who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin. If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to do what the Church does when she baptises") and that <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Trinitarian baptismal formula.|$|E

5|$|Brought by JC's {{agents to}} Liberty Island, Alex learns that the island holds an old {{part of the}} pre-Collapse {{worldwide}} communication network {{which can be used}} by each faction. No matter what choices Alex has made up to now, they can choose to side with any faction, or kill all the leaders on Liberty Island. If Alex follows JC's plan, the biomods are distributed worldwide, giving Helios the ability to access all human thought, allowing it to govern humanity. If Alex sides with the Illuminati, <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> network to help create a global surveillance state where communication and the economy are controlled. If Alex joins the Templars, they help unite humanity under a theocracy where biomod use and those considered impure are ruthlessly suppressed. Killing all other factions on Liberty Island leads to global chaos, turning Earth into a wasteland dominated by the Omar.|$|E
5|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain {{forms the}} final {{part of an}} {{unofficial}} trilogy with Moonlight Syndrome, a spin-off of the Twilight Syndrome series Suda's final work for Human Entertainment, and The Silver Case. According to Suda, while <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> same setting and have some recurring characters, there is otherwise no connection. Despite acting as a sequel to The Silver Case, and featuring a version of that game's protagonist Sumio Kodai, the story was almost completely unrelated {{to the events of}} The Silver Case. This approach was inspired by the Star System utilized by manga artist Osamu Tezuka. The opening scene, where Mondo drives his car towards the island, was put into the game to both introduce Mondo's character to newcomers, and to throw players of The Silver Case off guard and confirm Mondo's two different identities in the two games. It also helped establish the setting and get the player used to Mondo's point of view. His portable computer Catherine, stored in a suitcase, was a reference to the events of The Silver Case due to earlier events being concentrated within it. Despite this, its silver color was coincidental rather than a deliberate reference to the previous game's title.|$|E
5|$|In {{nineteenth century}} China, Jungle Village {{is home to}} several warring clans. The village {{blacksmith}} creates deadly weapons for the clans, intending to use his payments to purchase the freedom of his lover Lady Silk, and leave the village. The region's governor tasks the Lion Clan's leader, Gold Lion, with protecting a large shipment of gold that must pass through the village. Gold is betrayed by his lieutenants Silver Lion and Bronze Lion, who plan to steal the gold. <b>They</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> chaos ensuing from a fight with the Hyena Clan to allow their co-conspirator Poison Dagger—the governor's aide—to assassinate Gold, after which Silver becomes the Lions' leader. Gold's son Zen-Yi learns of his father's murder and sets off to the village to seek revenge.|$|E

At first, the family is scared, but realize how small the two characters are and decide to keep them as pets.|$|E
5|$|Peking opera {{features}} {{four main}} types of performers. Performing troupes often have several of each variety, {{as well as}} numerous secondary and tertiary performers. With their elaborate and colorful costumes, performers are the only focal points on Peking opera's characteristically sparse stage. <b>They</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> skills of speech, song, dance, and combat in movements that are symbolic and suggestive, rather than realistic. Above all else, the skill of performers is evaluated according to the beauty of their movements. Performers also adhere {{to a variety of}} stylistic conventions that help audiences navigate the plot of the production. The layers of meaning within each movement must be expressed in time with music. The music of Peking opera can be divided into the Xipi (西皮) and Erhuang (二黄) styles. Melodies include arias, fixed-tune melodies, and percussion patterns. The repertoire of Peking opera includes over 1,400 works, which are based on Chinese history, folklore, and, increasingly, contemporary life.|$|E
