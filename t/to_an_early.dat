The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) conducted Amalgam Virgo exercises on May 6 and 7 across the Greater Toronto Area using CF-18 Hornet jets, CH-124 Sea Kings, and CH-146 Griffon helicopters at low altitudes.

5|$|In 1995, Johns Hopkins {{narrowly}} retained an undefeated {{regular season}} by winning four one-goal games, which included an edging of Maryland, 16–15. Hopkins entered the tournament as the number-one seed, and again met Maryland in the semifinals. Edell helped guide the Terps <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> lead, and they ended the half with an advantage, 10–4, {{with the final}} result a rout, 16–8. The performance of Maryland goalie Brian Dougherty earned him {{the title of the}} tournament's Most Outstanding Player, despite the Terps' loss in the final against Syracuse.|$|E

5|$|In the {{afternoon}} draw, women's team play saw a split {{of the three}} available points. Mirjam Ott pushed out <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> lead against Heather Nedohin, and held her lead against a struggling Nedohin to win. Jennifer Jones played a back-and-forth game with Eve Muirhead, and won on a dramatic finish, tapping a buried stone to score a deuce in the final end. Allison Pottinger held an early lead over Margaretha Sigfridsson, but Sigfridsson rallied {{with the help of}} three stolen points and tied the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{comparative}} {{simplicity and}} regularity of the cerebellar anatomy led <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> {{hope that it}} might imply a similar simplicity of computational function, as expressed {{in one of the}} first books on cerebellar electrophysiology, The Cerebellum as a Neuronal Machine by John C. Eccles, Masao Ito, and János Szentágothai. Although a full understanding of cerebellar function has remained elusive, at least four principles have been identified as important: (1) feedforward processing, (2) divergence and convergence, (3) modularity, and (4) plasticity.|$|E
5|$|The game {{kicked off}} at 7:37 p.m. EST and Virginia Tech jumped <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> lead with a first-quarter touchdown.

5|$|The {{game was}} {{televised}} by CBS across the United States, which attracted over 17 million viewers. Georgetown jumped out <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> 1210 lead after twelve minutes of play, with eight of North Carolina's points coming from goaltending infractions by Ewing. The Hoyas entered halftime ahead {{by a single}} point, 3231. The teams traded the lead multiple times closing minutes of the second half. Following a turnover by Matt Doherty, Georgetown took the lead 6261 courtesy of a jump shot from Floyd. During the ensuing possession, North Carolina Freshman Michael Jordan hit a go-ahead basket with fifteen seconds remaining to give North Carolina a one-point advantage.|$|E
5|$|The {{problems}} of tomb construction {{can be seen}} with tombs of Ramesses III and his father Setnakhte. Setnakhte started to excavate KV11 but broke into the tomb of Amenmesse, so construction was abandoned and he instead usurped the tomb of Twosret, KV14. When looking for a tomb, Ramesses III extended the partly-excavated tomb started by his father. The tomb of Ramesses II returned <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> style, with a bent axis, {{probably due to the}} quality of the rock being excavated (following the Esna shale).|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{first game}} of the season was at home against Central Florida on August 31. In a game that saw the debut of quarterback Marcus Vick, brother of former star Hokie Michael Vick, 10th-ranked Virginia Tech pulled out <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> lead before Central Florida fought back in the second half. Tech recovered, however, and won the game, 48–29. Virginia Tech {{followed}} the victory with five others. On October 11, a fourth-ranked Hokie squad easily won against Syracuse University, 51–7, giving Virginia Tech a 6–0 record.|$|E

5|$|Although Mouton {{competed in}} only one world {{championship}} event during the season, she contested a full six-round British Rally Championship. Her campaign was plagued by reliability problems and she recorded only one finish. In the National Breakdown Rally, Mouton stopped after damaging her Quattro in a jump. After technical problems led <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> retirement at the Circuit of Ireland, she finished second at the Welsh Rally behind Malcolm Wilson in another Quattro. At the Scottish Rally, Mouton had been {{closing in on the}} leading Wilson until a transmission problem forced her to retire. At the Ulster Rally, she set the fastest time for the first stage but then dropped out with a mechanical failure. In the season-ending Manx International Rally, Mouton struggled to start her Quattro and then crashed out five stages later.|$|E

5|$|Ball State {{jumped out}} <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> lead via a Wenning to Snead touchdown, and led {{at the end}} of the first quarter 7–0. After the first quarter, due to Kennedy's ineffectiveness, Fredi Knighten took over at quarterback for Arkansas State, and in the second quarter, helped the team score 10 points while Ball State scored only 3 – at half time, the teams were tied at 10. Arkansas State made two field goals in the third quarter, thus {{entering}} the fourth with a six-point lead. However, Ball State scored via a field goal early in the quarter, and a touchdown with less than two minutes to play to retake the lead. Arkansas State promptly responded via a touchdown pass. Although Ball State was able to move the ball into field goal range as time waned, their field goal try was blocked, and ultimately Arkansas State held onto win the game, 23–20.|$|E
5|$|Born to a Pentecostal-minister father, D'Angelo {{was brought}} up <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> {{appreciation}} of gospel music, while his mother, a jazz enthusiast, {{introduced him to the}} musical complexities of trumpeter Miles Davis and the funk and soul music of the 1970s. In addition to old gospel records, these factors inspired him during the making of Brown Sugar, as D'Angelo drew upon his roots of traditional gospel and soul, and infused the sound of contemporary R and hip hop music to create a stylistically unique and soulful sound for the album. The album has been noted by critics for its classic soul elements and influences, as well as the sound of live instruments and organic grooves, which are reminiscent of the work of Stevie Wonder and Sly & the Family Stone. Its production contrasts the producer-driven and digital approach of contemporary R {{at the time of its}} release.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{accepted}} that the Americans {{did not need}} British help, but that it could still be useful in bringing the project <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> and successful conclusion. Working closely with {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., he attempted to do everything he could to support the effort. He also endeavoured to place British scientists in as many parts of the project as possible in order to facilitate a post-war British nuclear weapons project to which Chadwick was committed. Requests from Groves via Chadwick for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company, ministry or university currently employing them, only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to Tube Alloys. As a result, the British team was critical to the Project's success.|$|E

5|$|Hirst {{completed}} the 14th and final double {{of his career}} in 1913, leading the Yorkshire batting averages with 1,540 runs at an average of 35.81. His bowling was not as effective and he was no longer Yorkshire's main attacking bowler, as Alonzo Drake and Major Booth headed the averages. Hirst took 101 wickets at 20.13. During the following season, the last before the First World War, Hirst was further afflicted by injuries and missed some matches. He bowled far less frequently than in recent seasons and his 43 wickets, which cost 29.81, were his fewest since 1898; {{it was the first time}} since 1902 he failed to complete the double. His batting remained effective and he produced some good performances when his team were in difficult circumstances, although his two centuries were against the weaker bowling attacks of Northamptonshire and Somerset. He scored 1,670 runs at 41.75. In June, he was selected in a match to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the current Lord's ground, playing for the Rest of England against the MCC side which had toured South Africa the previous winter. The outbreak of war brought the season <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> close in August.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} stratum, fragmentary remains of round or {{elliptical}} buildings were discovered. The potsherds {{found in this}} layer date it to Early Bronze Age. In the third stratum large elliptical buildings, {{very similar to the}} structures uncovered in the third stratum in an excavation near Kiryat Ata, were exposed. An abundance of broken storage vessels, in their original place, were found there. This pottery indicates that the building should be ascribed <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> phase of Early Bronze Age. In the second stratum, sections of minor construction and a few potsherds from diverse periods were found. The potsherds could not be attributed with any degree of certainty to the architectural remains. Early Bronze Age II, Intermediate Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age and the Roman period stand out among the periods, to which these sherds are ascribed. A tomb attributed to the Middle Bronze Age was found; it contained scant remains of human bones and a bronze spearhead with a socket. The corner of a building that probably dated to the Early Roman period was discovered close to the surface {{in the eastern part of}} the excavation area.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 2016, Ubisoft {{revealed}} the game {{would be released}} on 15 November of that year for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One platforms in six separate editions. In September 2016, {{it was announced that}} Watch Dogs 2 would have enhancements on PlayStation 4 Pro. In October 2016, Ubisoft announced that the Windows version was delayed to 29 November 2016 to ensure that the game was well-optimized. It was featured on the front cover of Edge in August. Two weeks from release, Ubisoft and Samsung partnered to bundle a free digital download of Watch Dogs 2 with the purchase of their solid-state disks or curved gaming monitors. Amazon Prime copies were subject <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> release, which revealed issues with the seamless multiplayer. Ubisoft vowed to repair the feature on schedule but on the day of release, the company said it was broken – citing persistent lagging and crashing. Cooperative multiplayer was enabled a week after the game's release. A free trial lasting three hours was released for PlayStation 4 on 17 January 2017; the Xbox One version was downloadable on 24 January.|$|E
