5|$|Senator McCarthy's zeal {{to uncover}} {{subversion}} and espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics destroyed careers {{of people who}} were not involved in the infiltration of our government. His freewheeling style caused both the Senate and the Subcommittee <b>to</b> <b>revise</b> <b>the</b> rules governing future investigations, and prompted the courts to act to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at Congressional hearings....

40|$|Ontology is {{a formal}} {{explicit}} specification of shared conceptualisation. Ontology revision refers <b>to</b> <b>revising</b> <b>the</b> ontology {{as a result}} of learning or when new knowledge is gained. This paper discusses the possibility of using the concept of belief revision as a basis for ontology revision. Belief revision is concerned with the approach of updating and revising a belief set so that it remains consistent when new information is received. The consistency issue is important to ensure that it does not cause inconsistent beliefs or contradicts with existing beliefs. We propose to use the expansion, revision and contraction operators of belief revision <b>to</b> <b>revise</b> ontology. <b>The</b> conceptual framework of these operations will be presented...|$|R

5|$|After an {{extensive}} review of vineyard conditions {{in and around}} the existing Champagne region, INAO presented a proposal <b>to</b> <b>revise</b> <b>the</b> region on March 14, 2008. The proposal was prepared by a group of five experts in the subjects of history, geography, geology, phytosociology and agronomy, working from 2005. The proposal means expanding the region to cover vineyards in 357 rather than 319 villages. This is to be achieved by adding vineyards in forty villages while simultaneously removing two villages in the Marne départment that were included in the 1927 regulations, Germaine and Orbais-l'Abbaye.|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{the planned}} exhibit, {{especially}} those of the American Legion and the Air Force Association, charged that the exhibit focused too much attention on the Japanese casualties inflicted by the nuclear bomb, {{rather than on the}} motivations for the bombing or the discussion of the bomb's role in ending the conflict with Japan. The exhibit brought to national attention many long-standing academic and political issues related to retrospective views of the bombings. As a result, after various failed attempts <b>to</b> <b>revise</b> <b>the</b> exhibit {{in order to meet the}} satisfaction of competing interest groups, the exhibit was canceled on 30 January 1995. Martin O. Harwit, Director of the National Air and Space Museum, was compelled to resign over the controversy.|$|E
5|$|During the ship's refit in January 1944, her {{electronics}} were modernized. The CXAM {{was replaced}} by an SK model and the SC-1 {{was replaced by}} an SC-3. The forward SG was supplemented by an additional SG-1 mounted on a short mast at the aft end of the funnel. A lengthier overhaul in mid-1944 provided the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>revise</b> <b>the</b> radar arrangements. The SK radar {{was moved to the}} rebuilt foremast and the forward SG radar was replaced by an SG-1 mounted {{at the top of the}} foremast. An SM-1 fighter-control radar was mounted in the SK's former position and new antennas were added to the FD radars to allow them to determine target height. The SC-3 was replaced by an SC-4 in early 1945.|$|E

Finnish conservatives did not accept the state violence and anti-church policies of the Nazis. Still, there was sympathy for German aims <b>to</b> <b>revise</b> <b>the</b> Treaty of Versailles, although the official Finnish policy was reserved, especially after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Finland even recalled its ambassador for a short period.

During a session on March 21, 1952, Dawson was pushed to name Arthur Wray, MLA for Banff-Cochrane, after Wray made remarks towards a provincial official at a committee meeting. When asked by Dawson to withdraw the remarks, Wray refused, prompting Dawson to name him and order his removal from the chamber. A unanimous motion was later passed to suspend Wray for two sitting days, or until he withdrew his remarks and delivered an apology to the chamber. Wray returned four days later, issuing an apology and retracting his remarks.|$|E

5|$|In June 1844, the Senate, {{with its}} Whig majority, soundly {{rejected}} the Tyler–Texas treaty. The pro-annexation Democrat Polk narrowly defeated anti-annexation Whig Henry Clay in the 1844 presidential election. In December 1844, lame-duck President Tyler called on Congress to pass his treaty by simple majorities in each house. The Democratic-dominated House of Representatives complied with his request by passing an amended bill expanding on the pro-slavery {{provisions of the}} Tyler treaty. The Senate narrowly passed a compromise version of the House bill (by the vote of the minority Democrats and several southern Whigs), designed to provide the incoming President-elect Polk the options of immediate annexation of Texas or new talks <b>to</b> <b>revise</b> <b>the</b> annexation terms of the House-amended bill.|$|E

It was a fictional rendering of Joyce's youth, but he eventually grew frustrated with its direction and abandoned this work. It was never published in this form, but years later, in Trieste, Joyce completely rewrote it as A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. The unfinished Stephen Hero was published after his death.|$|E
