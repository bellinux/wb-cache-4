5|$|Although {{the seeds}} of both {{proactive}} government repression against the Puerto Rican independence movement had been planted before the Grito de Lares, and its aftermath only guaranteed <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> autonomism as a political alternative in the island, the level of cultural and social development of a collective Puerto Rican conscience was almost {{a direct consequence of}} the event. To put it simply, if there is any nationalistic sentiment in Puerto Rico in the present day, almost all of it {{can be traced back to}} Betances and his political work.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 29 November 1877, heavy rain caused the dam of the Rhodgeidio mill near Llanerchymedd to breach, and <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> water washed away the wooden Caemawr bridge over the Afon Alaw. The first train {{of the day was}} driven by William Taylor, with fireman John Saunders and railway {{inspector}} John Davies also on the footplate. The train also included two coal trucks, a passenger coach, and a guard's van, with Edward Hughes serving as the guard. The whole train went {{over the side of the}} bridge into the river. Edward Hughes dragged himself out, and was taken to the nearest farm. John Davies was scalded to death, and Taylor and Saunders were found injured, and could not be freed until mid-day. John Saunders later died from his injuries.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} liberation, Belgium began {{a period of}} rapid {{economic}} recovery {{and the process of}} political reconstruction began. The traditional party system had been torn apart by the war and occupation. The two major ideological blocks proceeded to create their own parties: socialists created the Belgian Socialist Party (PSB–BSP), while Catholics and conservatives created the Christian Social Party (PSC–CVP). The biggest change in early post-liberation politics was <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> support for the Communist Party of Belgium, which become the third party in Belgian politics until 1949, temporarily displacing the Liberal Party. The Walloon Movement also re-emerged after the war, promoting the culture and economic interests of the French-speaking areas in the south. The period saw major reform of trade unions following the creation of the first large unified union, the General Federation of Belgian Labour (FGTB–ABVV), in April 1945 with 248,000 members nationwide. By 1947, however, the political structure of the Belgian state had stabilised.|$|E

5|$|The {{crash was}} only {{accessible}} to vehicles via a single residential street. With <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> rescue personnel who {{converged on the}} area, the roads leading to the site soon became choked with traffic. Emergency vehicle drivers abandoned their vehicles counter to established policy {{in the course of}} the rescue efforts. This prevented other vehicles from being able to access the crash area. The road was so impassible, many rescue workers left their vehicles miles away and made it to the scene on foot. Fog also grounded rescue helicopters for two hours. As a result, many critically injured survivors were not evacuated until 23:30. Eventually, four helicopters from the New York City Police Aviation Unit evacuated 21 people from the crash site. There were also major problems with communication by rescuers. Radio frequencies became overloaded and authorities on site were unable to make command decisions in some cases. The head of surgery of the Nassau County Medical Center was present at the scene but unable to direct patients to the best locations because many rescuers were radioing the center itself to get advice on where they should send the survivors. Medical professionals on site reported that some hospitals received the most up-to-date information by watching the news coverage. Despite these problems, however, only three of the passengers found alive died of their injuries.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> German nationalism, {{stimulated by}} the {{experience}} of Germans in the Napoleonic period and initially allied with liberalism, shifted political, social, and cultural relationships within the German states. In this context, one can detect {{its roots in the}} experience of Germans in the Napoleonic period. The Burschenschaft student organizations and popular demonstrations, such as those held at Wartburg Castle in October 1817, contributed to a growing sense of unity among German speakers of Central Europe. Furthermore, implicit and sometimes explicit promises made during the War of Liberation engendered an expectation of popular sovereignty and widespread participation in the political process, promises that largely went unfulfilled once peace had been achieved. Agitation by student organizations led such conservative leaders as Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich, to fear the rise of national sentiment; the assassination of German dramatist August von Kotzebue in March 1819 by a radical student seeking unification was followed on 20 September 1819 by the proclamation of the Carlsbad Decrees, which hampered intellectual leadership of the nationalist movement.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> air travellers, catalyzed by {{low-cost}} {{carriers and}} the rise of air-transport demands among Indonesia's rising middle class, has put intense stress on Indonesia's aging airports. Nevertheless, there has been some efforts to improve and upgrade airport facilities, such as the construction of Medan's brand-new Kuala Namu Airport to replace the overwhelmed, aging, and accident-prone Polonia Airport. Other newly built airports include Lombok Airport, replacing the old Selaparang Airport in Lombok; and Minangkabau Airport, replacing the old Tabing Airport in Padang. Existing airports that have undergone massive expansion and upgrades include Ngurah Rai Airport in Bali, Juanda Airport in Surabaya, and Sultan Hasanuddin Airport in Makassar. There are plans to build a second Bali airport in Kubu Tambahan near Singaraja, northern Bali, a new larger airport in Kulon Progo near Yogyakarta to replace the crowded and overwhelmed Adisutjipto Airport, and Kertajati Airport in Kertajati, Majalengka, to replace Bandung's Husein Sastranegara Airport and also to serve the vicinity of Cirebon. To improve transportation interconnectivity, the government plans to build railways connecting airports all over Indonesia with nearby city centers. Currently, only Kuala Namu and Adisutjipto airports have a railway connection to the city center, while airport railways are currently under construction in Soekarno–Hatta and Minangkabau airports.|$|E
