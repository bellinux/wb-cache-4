25|$|Higher wind {{pressures}} {{increased the}} speaking volume of theatre organ pipes, {{and they were}} placed in chambers, usually high in the auditorium. The fronts of these chambers were covered {{with a set of}} swell shades which opened and closed like venetian blinds. When closed, the sound of the organ was reduced <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>whisper.</b> With a foot pedal, the organist could gradually open the shutters to produce louder and louder sounds from the same pipes. Although this type of swell chamber was not new, theatre organ developments permitted a much broader dynamic range than ever before.|$|E
2500|$|Rosenberg {{ran against}} Christopher Cox in the 1988 {{race for the}} seat {{representing}} California's 40th congressional district. For the period of January 1 to March 31, 1988, Rosenberg's campaign had raised $195,986 to Cox's $186,082. Rosenberg led the contenders for the 40th Congressional District in total expenses for the period. Rosenberg {{was seen as an}} early favorite in the 1988 race, though his candidacy was subject <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>whisper</b> campaign that the majority of his supporters were followers of his brother Erhard's est training. [...] "His money is est money," [...] said a political operative in Orange County in a statement in the Sacramento Bee.|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{was also}} {{famous for his}} {{peculiar}} skill with the train whistle. His whistle was made of six thin tubes bound together, the shortest being half {{the length of the}} longest. Its unique sound involved a long-drawn-out note that began softly, rose and then died away <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>whisper,</b> a sound that became his trademark. The sound of it was variously described as [...] "a sort of whippoorwill call," [...] or [...] "like the war cry of a Viking." [...] People living along the IC line between Jackson and Water Valley would turn over in their beds late at night upon hearing it and say [...] "There goes Casey Jones" [...] as he roared by.|$|E

3000|$|In surprise/admiration, br/wh voice {{along the}} whole word/phrase was {{predominant}} (80 % of the tokens), with the breathiness approaching <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>whispered</b> quality. Note that the harmonic components are much weaker in the [...] "aa" [...] portion of Figure 8 (e).|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{never see}} her myself,' said Robert, in answer <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>whispered</b> inquiry from his sister. 'Or {{it would be more}} correct to say she will never see me. But I hear from the others that she speaks of you constantly.' ...|$|R

(a) A high-stress silicon nitride nanobeam coupled <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>whispering</b> gallery mode {{microdisk}} by dipole interaction. (b) A phoxonic crystal with colocalized mechanical and optical modes. (c) A mechanically compliant aluminum capacitor used <b>to</b> form <b>a</b> superconducting LC oscillator.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{said the}} eldest Miss Papaver in <b>a</b> <b>whisper,</b> [...] "I always Enjoy violin music so much." [...] And Mrs Pirbright answered, [...] "We get so little Nice music down here." [...] And Miss Papaver said, [...] "He plays Very nicely." [...] And Mrs Pirbright, [...] "Such a Delicate Touch!" [...] And Miss Papaver, [...] "Does Willie keep up his lessons?" [...] and so <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>whispered</b> conversation.|$|R

30|$|From the {{analysis}} results in Section 5, we can infer that breathiness occurring along with lower pitch and being closer <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>whispered</b> quality (as in real feeling expression, surprise/admiration, gentle/tender speaking style, confidential talking, diffidence) is more controlled and attitude-related, while the one occurring along with higher pitch (as in excitement, surprise/unexpectedness) is more spontaneous and emotion-related.|$|R
40|$|An all-optical passive four-port system {{including}} a fused silica microsphere and two tapered fibers is proposed and demonstrated {{for the application}} as a channel adding-dropping device. It is shown that channels can be selectively exchanged between two fibers by coupling <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>whispering</b> gallery mode resonance in the microsphere. Finesse in excess of 11150 is measured for the loaded whispering gallery modes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} first {{mid-infrared}} ring laser diode based on InAs and grown by liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). Coherent emission for a 200 μm ring resonator was obtained near 3. 0 μm at 80 K. The individual modes exhibit hardly any wavelength shift with increasing injection current. The {{absence of a}} significant modal wavelength shift confirms that the emission originates from in-plane propagation around the inside perimeter of the mesa due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>whispering</b> gallery mode which is facilitated by total internal reflection with high Q...|$|R
