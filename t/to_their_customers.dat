5|$|With {{investment}} subsidies, {{the financial}} burden falls upon the taxpayer, while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are paid out {{as a function of}} the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer rebates <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>customers,</b> such as Austin Energy in Texas, which offers $2.50/watt installed up to $15,000.|$|E
5|$|Trucking {{companies}} (motor carriers) {{can also}} play a role in HOS violations. Certain carriers may choose to knowingly ignore HOS violations made by their drivers, or even encourage their drivers to do so. Allowing drivers to violate the HOS is an effective cost-cutting measure used mostly by non-union, long haul carriers. Permitting HOS violations allows a carrier to hire fewer drivers, and run on fewer trucks than a company which follows the rules. To comply with the HOS, these companies would have to hire more drivers (possibly driving up wages) and purchase additional trucks and trailers. Making a change to comply with the law is complicated by competition with carriers that already comply with HOS regulations. Due to this competition, carriers who choose to switch from non-compliance could not pass on all of their increased costs associated with HOS compliance <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>customers.</b>|$|E

25|$|U.S. freight railroads {{operate in}} a highly {{competitive}} marketplace. To compete effectively against each other and against other transportation providers, railroads must offer high-quality service at competitive rates. In 2011, within the U.S., railroads carried 39.9% of freight by ton-mile, followed by trucks (33.4%), oil pipelines (14.3%), barges (12%) and air (0.3%). However, railroads' revenue share has been slowly falling for decades, {{a reflection of the}} intensity of the competition they face and of the large rate reductions railroads have passed through <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>customers</b> over the years.|$|E
25|$|In Israel water tariffs are levied for all {{uses and}} at all stages of production, from {{groundwater}} abstraction, to bulk water sales to final users. Investments are financed both through self-financing from water sales revenues, through commercial debt and through various subsidies paid to municipalities and to Mekorot. From 2010-12 regional water companies distributed the equivalent of $55 million in profits to their municipal shareholders.

25|$|When the United States {{began to}} expand {{to the west}} {{and other parts of the}} country, so did the {{distance}} of businesses <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>customers.</b> When businesses were close to those who purchased goods or services from them, it was easy for the merchants to extend credit to them, due to their proximity and the fact that merchants knew their customers personally and knew whether or not they would be able to pay them back. As trading distances increased, merchants no longer personally knew their customers and became leery of extending credit to people who they did not know in fear of them not being able to pay them back. Business owners' hesitation to extend credit to new customers led to the birth of the credit reporting industry.|$|E
25|$|The People's State Bank {{was cast}} in the {{commercial}} style of architecture and has detailing heavily influenced by Classical Revival, a popular style for bank buildings at the time. The building, a one-story structure, stands on a concrete foundation with 12 inch (30cm) thick walls, and a full basement. The Classical detailing is emphasized {{through the use of}} brick, glass, and concrete throughout the building. The simple design exhibits several Classical Revival influences, among them: its masonry construction, giving it a sturdy appearance, its symmetry, the brick divides on the wall which resemble pilasters, and the semi circular fanlights on the above the east and west facade windows. The size of the interior lobby further emphasized the feeling of solidity, which banks wished to convey <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>customers.</b>|$|E

25|$|Nearly all {{legitimate}} {{e-mail messages}} from companies <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>customers</b> contain {{an item of}} information that is not readily available to phishers. Some companies, for example PayPal, always address their customers by their username in emails, so if an email addresses the recipient in a generic fashion ("Dear PayPal customer") {{it is likely to}} be an attempt at phishing. Furthermore, PayPal offers various methods to determine spoof emails and advises users to forward suspicious emails to their spoof@PayPal.com domain to investigate and warn other customers. Emails from banks and credit card companies often include partial account numbers. However, recent research has shown that the public do not typically distinguish between the first few digits and the last few digits of an account numberâ€”a significant problem since the first few digits are often the same for all clients of a financial institution.|$|E
25|$|Value-added tax {{avoids the}} cascade effect of sales tax by taxing only the value added {{at each stage}} of production. For this reason, {{throughout}} the world, VAT has been gaining favor over traditional sales taxes. In principle, VAT applies to all provisions of goods and services. VAT is assessed and collected {{on the value of}} goods or services that have been provided every time there is a transaction (sale/purchase). The seller charges VAT to the buyer, and the seller pays this VAT to the government. If, however, the purchasers are not the end users, but the goods or services purchased are costs to their business, the tax they have paid for such purchases can be deducted from the tax they charge <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>customers.</b> The government only receives the difference; in other words, it is paid tax on the gross margin of each transaction, by each participant in the sales chain.|$|E
25|$|Zawgyi is not Unicode-compliant, but {{occupies}} the same code space as Unicode Myanmar font. As {{it is not}} defined as a standard character encoding, Zawgyi is not built in to any major operating systems as standard. However, allow for its position as the de facto (but largely undocumented) standard within the country, telcos and major smartphone distributors (such as Huawei and Samsung) ship phones with Zawgyi font overwriting standard Unicode-compliant fonts, which are installed on most internationally-distributed hardware. Facebook also supports Zawgyi as an additional language encoding for their app and website. As a result, almost all SMS alerts (including those from telcos <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>customers),</b> social media posts and other web resources may be incomprehensible on these devices without the custom Zawgyi font installed at the operating system level. These may include devices purchased overseas, or distributed by companies who do not customize software for the local market.|$|E

And then, the result from that questionnaire must be calculated to produce customer satisfaction level, which is need a lot of time. In this research, an Customer Satisfaction Control Application was created to help Quality Assurance Department to distribute questionnaire, and to help in measuring the performance of every department/unit in Petra Christian University. This application will be build using fuzzy aggregation to examine the customer satisfaction questionnaire result and build using MYSQL and PHP. Based on testing, this application has helped the users in evaluating the performance, and with the usage of graphics which explain the result of the questionnaire in more detail, and distributing the questionnaires to most of university students, administration staff, and lecturers...|$|R
