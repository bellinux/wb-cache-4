5|$|With The Evil Thing destroyed, Max, Sean and Cassie save Priscilla. She angrily {{yells at}} Cassie and calls her a witch, and Sean rejects Priscilla {{in favor of}} Cassie. After Priscilla leaves, they save the pizza {{delivery}} man, who offers them free pizza in return for releasing him, then follows Priscilla to hit on her, to her disgust. Cassie and Sean burn the book and set aside all their thoughts about The Evil Thing. Sean leaves shortly afterward. Cassie and Max's parents then come home and find the book in the fireplace. The father mockingly reads it out loud, reviving The Evil Thing. The film concludes with Cassie realizing that The Evil <b>Thing</b> <b>has</b> been brought back to life {{and that it is}} not over yet.|$|E
5|$|John's {{preparations}} have no effect, however, {{as he is}} tricked into {{killing the}} guardian that had been preventing the tragedy, freeing a beast which can control the collective unconsciousness of mankind. John Constantine cuts his own wrists, in order to free himself from consciousness, and plays a confidence trick on the beast, allowing his friends time to use the collective consciousness to rebuild the guardian that had kept the beast trapped. However, in this process, Swamp <b>Thing</b> <b>has</b> his human soul removed, setting up the fourth run of the comic, relaunched shortly afterward. In the process John loses his memory, setting up the {{events leading up to}} the 200th issue. Leading up to the landmark issue, John has little control over events, and is led along by a psychic serial killer, who threatens to kill Chas and his family, and a demon, Rosacarnis, who offers his memories back, at the cost of 24 hours in her service. John eventually gives into this offer, and the 200th issue shows how Rosacarnis manipulates his reality, making him raise three children with her, in the guise of Kit Ryan, from Garth Ennis's time on the title, Zed, from Jamie Delano's, and Angie, from the current run, with three different artists, Steve Dillon, Marcelo Frusin and Leonardo Manco each drawing one story, as the past, present and future of the title.|$|E

25|$|According to the Mrs Ws, the Black Thing is {{the source}} of all evil in the universe, and little more is {{described}} of it.

25|$|Aristotle holds a teleological worldview: he {{sees the}} {{universe}} as inherently purposeful. Basically, Aristotle claims that potentiality exists {{for the sake of}} actuality. Thus, matter exists for the sake of receiving its form, and an organism has sight for the sake of seeing. Now, each <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> certain potentialities {{as a result of its}} form. Because of its form, a snake has the potential to slither. Hence, we can say that the snake ought to slither. The more a thing achieves its potential, the more it succeeds in achieving its purpose.|$|E

25|$|Abduction, deduction, and {{induction}} make incomplete {{sense in}} isolation from one another but comprise a cycle understandable as a whole insofar as they collaborate toward the common end of inquiry. In the pragmatic {{way of thinking about}} conceivable practical implications, every <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> a purpose, and, as possible, its purpose should first be denoted. Abduction hypothesizes an explanation for deduction to clarify into implications to be tested so that induction can evaluate the hypothesis, in the struggle to move from troublesome uncertainty to more secure belief. No matter how traditional and needful it is to study the modes of inference in abstraction from one another, the integrity of inquiry strongly limits the effective modularity of its principal components.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Thing</b> <b>has</b> {{subsequently}} {{been released}} twice on DVD by Universal in 1998 and 2005. The 1998 edition was a Universal Collector's Edition, featuring The Thing: Terror Takes Shape, an extensive 83-minute documentary. It details {{all aspects of}} the film and features interviews from many of the people involved. There are detailed stories from the cast and crew concerning the adapted screenplay, the special effects, the post-production, the critical reception, and more. Other features include deleted scenes, the alternative ending shown in the television version, a theatrical trailer and production notes. Additionally, John Carpenter and Kurt Russell provide commentary throughout the film. An anamorphic widescreen transfer was not included, but this omission was remedied with the second DVD/HD DVD release in October 2004, which featured identical supplements to the 1998 release, {{with the exception of the}} isolated score track from the documentary. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc in Europe on October 6, 2008.|$|E

500|$|Criticism to {{the episode}} {{was done by}} Finley who said, [...] "So much of this show is {{dependent}} on Monk's subtle mannerisms, but he exaggerates them to an absurd degree {{as he tries to}} impress the actor who's playing him." [...] Similarly, Werts said [...] "Shalhoub pushes a tad too far with the compulsions." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today was also critical of its [...] "excessive quirks and overall credibility-busting silliness."

500|$|Learning to be yourself, to be {{authentic}} and to act with integrity, rather than conforming to any external moral system, is arguably the fundamental motif of Williams's work, according to Sophie Grace Chappell. [...] "If there's one theme in all my work it's about authenticity and self-expression," [...] Williams said in 2002. [...] "It's the idea that some things are in some real sense really you, or express what you and others aren't... The whole <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> been about spelling out the notion of inner necessity." [...] He moved moral philosophy away from the Kantian question, [...] "What is my duty?", {{and back to the}} issue that mattered to the Greeks: [...] "How should we live?" ...|$|E
500|$|After Paramount {{rejected}} the film, Roddenberry sought to produce The God Thing as a novel {{in the late}} 1970s. He signed a deal with Bantam Books to publish it, but was given extensions because of his work; first on PhaseII and then The Motion Picture. During this period, Star Trek actor Walter Koenig helped Roddenberry expand the novel. In 1991, shortly before Roddenberry's death, his assistant Susan Sackett rediscovered {{the work on the}} novel. She contacted Pocket Books, which wanted to publish it; discussions to hire Sackett and Fred Bronson to expand it to novel length were held, but negotiations stopped after Roddenberry's death and Sackett's dismissal from [...] Michael Jan Friedman was later engaged to expand the work but it went unpublished. The God <b>Thing</b> <b>has</b> been compared to the film [...] that dealt with similar religious concepts.|$|E
500|$|For {{her fourth}} album, The House (2010), Melua worked with {{producer}} William Orbit. She {{said about the}} experience: [...] "The whole <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> been really exciting. It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew all I {{had to do was}} let myself go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn't {{trying to get away from}} anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E
