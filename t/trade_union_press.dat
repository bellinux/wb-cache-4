40|$|The {{history of}} Brazil may be {{presented}} or interpreted {{with the aid}} of various historical sources. Among these sources, communicative production has generally gained increasing importance to the historiography making. Thus, we highlight the editorial cartoons {{in the context of the}} Brazilian <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>press,</b> which, in our studies, occupy a central position as a communication product and historical source. Since the late 1970 s, with the resurgence of the trade union movement under the aegis of a ‘new trade unionism,’ the editorial cartoon has been used as a significant communication strategy that reveals the broadest and most notorious political processes. Compiling sets of editorial cartoons into collections has helped providing a rich research material, promoting the availability of alternative historical sources for historiography making. This article aims to identify and analyze collections of editorial cartoons produced in the context of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>press,</b> characterizing them as historical sources to produce an analysis of history against the grain.   Keywords: Editorial Cartoon; Trade Union Press; Historical Source; Visual Source; Communication Strategy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relation between}} the publisher, editor and contents of the <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>press.</b> It fo-cuses on in which degree the publisher determines the editorial content and on the significance of the edito-rial responsibility conditions. The examination starts from the journalistic paradigm ‘the news paradigm’. According to this paradigm the journalist is serving the public and therefore has to be independent and critical. The examination is in two parts. The first part {{examines the}} editors understanding of how much the pub-lishers determine the editorial content. Part two is a content analysis, which examines in which degree and in what ways the publishers are exposed in the magazines. The exposition of the publishers is taken as an indicator of the publishers’ determination of the editorial content. The conclusion is that the editors experience a distinct grade of self-determine and that the journalism is critical towards the publishers. There is a tendency towards less experience of self-determination on the magazines where the publisher is responsible, than on the magazines, where the editor is responsible. The content analysis shows that the texts contain several indicators that the publishers determine a great amount of the editorial content. However, this is most distinct in the magazine where the editor is responsible. The two parts show that there is not any clear-cut connection between the editorial responsibility conditions and how much the publishers determine the editorial content. The examination also indicates that the magazines are raising the publishers profile and that the editors at the same time seek to make journalism that is critical towards the publisher. This is interpreted as the edi-tors attempt to balance between two different expectations to the journalism: the publishers wish to get the profile raised in the magazines and the journalists wish to serve the public and be critical towards the pub-lisher. In the paper the possibility to solve this balance problem by thinking journalism differently is discussed. It is argued that the journalists have to see themselves as part of the trade unions instead of detached spectators. And it is suggested that the journalists and the leaders of the trade unions cooperate on concrete and spe-cific guidelines for the journalism in the <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>press...</b>|$|E

His father worked as a blacksmith in a factory, earning 8 Marks a week and working ten hours each day. His mother supplemented the family income by taking in washing from the [...] "fine houses". Albert himself started working when he reached the age of ten, delivering milk and bread products to middle-class homes in the early mornings. This involved starting work at four in the morning, from which he later claimed to have acquired a useful talent for getting by without very much sleep. Later he received a training as a waiter, and worked in this profession till 1904. In 1904 he relocated to Bremen where he worked as a machinist before joining the crew of a merchant steamer as a fireman and sailor. During this time he visited Britain and for the first time came across asn example of a workers' strike, something which he later recalled made a strong impression on him. While still a young man he joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD). He obtained a job as a mechanic/fitter with the railways, working on the network's signal boxes. In 1912 he left the SPD, as his political sympathies moved towards Anarcho-syndicalism. During the immediate prewar years he was an employee of the <b>Trades</b> <b>Union</b> <b>Press.</b> After that he was drafted into the army and served in the First World War as a radio operator.|$|R

After war women were apt to return to a family-oriented way of life again. As a result, enrollment of home making education for boys decreased from 49, 679 in 1939 to 26, 490 in 1954.

40|$|Literature on the 1984 - 85 miners' {{strike in}} Britain {{tends to be}} {{dominated}} by examination of peak level relations between the Conservative government, the National Coal Board and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). The strike is usually depicted as being illegitimately imposed, without a national ballot, on the industry and the miners by the NUM leadership. This article develops a more rounded perspective on the strike, by locating its origins in workplace conflict which had been steadily escalating in the early 1980 s in the Scottish coalfields. A significant portion of Scottish miners, anxious about employment prospects and angry about managerial incursions on established joint industrial regulation of daily mining operations, pushed their union towards a more militant position. This subverts the conventional picture of the strike as a top-down phenomenon. In this respect events in Scotland, which rarely feature in established literature, were in fact extremely important, shaping the national strike that emerged from the workforce's opposition to managerial authoritarianism as well as the closure of uneconomic pits. The peak level context of deteriorating relations and pit level details of incrementally intensifying workplace conflict are established through industry and <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> records and <b>press</b> accounts...|$|R
