30|$|As can be {{observed}} from the figures, CAUEP has the best performance, outperforming UEPZW by around 0.2 dB {{in the case of}} foreman sequence and by around 0.3 to 1 [*]dB in the case of carphone and stefan. When using EEPWZ the motion information and the transform coefficients were provided the same protection level. The EEPWZ is a similar case of SLEP since the motion information and the transform coefficients are protected at the same parity data rate. The difference is that in the EEPWZ case, the parity bits of the motion information and the transform coefficients are sent in individual packets. This makes the experiment results comparable with our unequal error protection based methods. The curve of H 264 + ER + EC shows the result of the H. 264 using slice group feature for error resilience in the encoding process and the previous colocated slice replacement for the error concealment strategy in the decoding process. All four schemes use the same amount of <b>total</b> <b>data</b> <b>rate.</b> Wyner-Ziv based methods allocated part of the <b>total</b> <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> budget to transmit the information protected via the Pseudo Wyner-Ziv codec.

40|$|This paper explores video {{transmission}} over networks {{that allow the}} reservation of guaranteed bandwidth, such as ATM[7] and RSVP[9]. Because the reservation of bandwidth is costly, {{we would like to}} minimize the amount of reserved bandwidth while utilizing the available best-e ort bandwidth as much as possible. However, the coding scheme has to compensate for the expected data loss from the best-e ort channel to avoid image degradation. Some earlier schemes (H. 261, MPEG) require high reserved bandwidth to maintain good image quality, because they do not compensate for lost data. Other schemes (Motion JPEG, intra-H. 261) do compensate for data loss. However, they tend to increase the <b>total</b> <b>data</b> <b>rate.</b> We present a reservation-based coding (RVC) which isavariant of the commonly-used video conferencing standard H. 261 [4]. RVC compensates for data loss in the best-e ort channel, without overly increasing the <b>total</b> <b>data</b> <b>rate.</b> This minimizes the reserved bandwidth needed to maintain a high quality video conference. Our experimental results show that the bandwidth required for the reserved channel is minimal (averaging 1 K- 2 K bytes per medium to high motion CIF frame) while maintaining good image quality under data loss. Further, the total bandwidth requirements for an entire frame is only slightly higher than that of H. 261, and much less than that of intra-H. 261. The RVC coding scheme shows a good tradeo between data rate and tolerance of data loss. RVC's overall data rate is only slightly higher than H. 261, and it exhibits excellent tolerance to data loss. Therefore, under the RVC scheme, the amount of reserved bandwidth can be minimized. Further, RVC's <b>total</b> <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> is up to 20 % less than that of intra-H. 261, while maintaining comparable image quality under data loss. ...|$|E

30|$|To {{meet the}} {{ever-increasing}} demands of mobile traffic, femtocells are {{considered as one}} of the promising solutions. In this paper, we study a sensing-based resource allocation scenario in cognitive femtocell networks and present an efficient distributed imperfect-spectrum-sensing-based resource allocation (DIRA) algorithm while considering the channel uncertainty to maximize the <b>total</b> <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> of cognitive femtocell networks by jointly optimizing both subchannel assignment and power allocation taking into account the influence of the sensing accuracy. However, the general optimization problem {{turns out to be a}} mixed integer programming problem. In order to make it tractable, the original optimization problem is divided into two sub-optimization problems,namely,optimal subchannel allocation and optimal power allocation. Specifically, the proposed distributed fairness-based subchannel allocation (DFSA) algorithm guarantees fairness by introducing channel condition difference and satisfaction degree as the indicators of subchannel allocation. Additionally, optimal power allocation with the consideration of imperfect spectrum sensing and interference uncertainty is performed using the proposed chance-constrained power optimization (CPO) algorithm. Bernstein’s approximation is conducted to make the chance constraint tractable. Simulation results illustrate that the distributed imperfect-spectrum-sensing-based resource allocation (DIRA) algorithm can provide considerable fairness among femtocells and at the same time maximize the <b>total</b> <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> of the cognitive femtocell network.|$|E

50|$|The FPD-Link data {{transmission}} scheme serializes seven single-ended data bits per clock cycle {{into each of}} the LVDS channels. Therefore, the LVDS bit rate is 7 times {{the frequency of the}} clock signal.

This means there are 21 <b>total</b> <b>data</b> signals in each clock cycle, which means the 7 to 1 serialization reduces this down to 3 data channels. Then if the clock signal is 50 MHz the LVDS streaming video <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> will be 350 Mbit/s per channel, and the <b>total</b> <b>data</b> transfer <b>rate</b> will be 1,050 Mbit/s over the 3 channels.|$|R

40|$|The {{scaling of}} CMOS {{technology}} continues {{to improve the}} processor capability and memory capacity, requiring memory interface with higher bandwidth and better energy efficiency to enhance the overall system performance. Among those cutting-edge designs of memory interface, multi-band signaling has shown great potential for its high throughput along with low energy consumption. With spectrally divided signaling, the multi-band transceiver can be designed to avoid spectral notches and extend communication bandwidth on multi-drop buses. Also, the multi-band transceiver is immune to inter-symbol interference caused by channel attenuation because of unique self-equalization double-sideband signaling. In this dissertation, we will demonstrate a tri-band transceiver with four parallel lanes that achieved a <b>total</b> <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> of 40 Gb/s with total power consumption of 38 mW in 28 nm CMOS technology. To realize the <b>total</b> <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> of 40 Gb/s, PAM- 4 and 16 -QAM are used at the baseband and 3 / 6 GHz bands, respectively, to carry 10 parallel bit streams at 1 GBaud via each lane of the transceivers. These ten parallel bit streams share the same physical channel to minimize the time skew among them. In view of this, the strobe signal, DQS, is {{assigned to one of}} the ten bits for data recovery at the receiving end. Under 6 dB attenuation at 6 GHz on a 2 ” dense FR- 4 differential bus (line pitch of 6 mil), the transmitting end consumes only 1. 6 mW/lane. Together with 4. 7 mW/lane of the receiving end and 13. 4 mW of the carrier generator to be shared among all lanes consumes, the total power consumption and average energy efficiency are 38 mW and 0. 95 pJ/b. Compared with prior arts, the proposed design achieves not only better energy efficiency but also substantial size advantage (0. 01 mm 2 /lane, including the carrier generator). This transceiver realizes a <b>total</b> <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> of 40 Gb/s with BER < 10 ^- 12. Moreover, this tri-band architecture can be scaled in the frequency domain for further increasing the data throughput without increasing the symbol rate, which enables a new design dimension with more compact size and significantly improved energy efficiency for future memory interfaces...|$|E
30|$|Virtual {{radio access}} {{networks}} (RANs) is the candidate solution for 5 G access networks, {{the concept of}} virtualised radio resources completing the virtual RAN paradigm. This paper proposes a new analytical model {{for the management of}} virtual radio resources in full heterogeneous networks. The estimation of network capacity and <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> allocation are the model’s two main components. Based on the probability distribution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio observed at the user terminal, the model leads to the probability distribution for the <b>total</b> network <b>data</b> <b>rate.</b> It considers different approaches for the estimation of the <b>total</b> network <b>data</b> <b>rate,</b> based on different channel qualities, i.e., optimistic, realistic and pessimistic. The second component uses the outcome of the first one in order to maximise the weighted <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> subject to the total network capacity, the SLAs (service level agreements) of Virtual Network Operators (VNOs), and fairness. The weights for services in the objective function of the resource allocation component enable the model to have prioritisation among services. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated in a practical heterogeneous access network. Results show an increase of 2.5 times in network capacity by implementing an access point at the centre of each cell of a cellular network. It is shown that the cellular network capacity itself can vary from 0.9  Gbps in the pessimistic approach up to 5.5  Gbps in the optimistic one. Finally, the isolation of service classes and VNOs by means of virtualisation of radio resources is clearly demonstrated.|$|R
30|$|The {{management}} {{hierarchy of}} virtual radio resources is also shown in Figure  2, consisting of VRRM {{on the top}} of the usual radio resource management entities in heterogeneous access networks [16], common RRM (CRRM), and local RRM (LRRM). The VRRM estimates the <b>total</b> network <b>data</b> <b>rate,</b> then, having the available estimated resources, it allocates capacity to the different services of each VNO so that minimum and maximum guaranteed capacities are met. This section presents the analytical modelling, considering the estimation of resources, and their allocation without and with violation of SLAs.|$|R
30|$|Intuitively, {{when the}} ratio of <b>total</b> <b>data</b> {{generation}} <b>rate</b> to the per-node channel bandwidth increases, the minimum number of surface-level nodes required to make the problem feasible increases. This {{is due to the}} fact that surface gateways will saturate with incoming traffic and, therefore, more nodes will be needed to handle the additional traffic corresponding to the increased <b>data</b> generation <b>rate.</b> On the other hand, increasing channel capacity reduces the network load, and consequently, our assumptions about ignoring queuing delays become more realistic. To demonstrate the effect of channel capacity on the quality of the solution, we solve the deployment optimization problem for different link capacities, namely 5, 10, and 50 kbps.|$|R
