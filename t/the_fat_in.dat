5|$|Early {{research}} {{on the role of}} antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of unsaturated fats, which is the cause of rancidity. Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> <b>in</b> a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. However, it was the identification of vitamins A, C, and E as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of living organisms. The possible mechanisms of action of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized. Research into how vitamin E prevents the process of lipid peroxidation led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by scavenging reactive oxygen species before they can damage cells.|$|E

30|$|A {{point to}} be noted is that <b>the</b> {{abdominal}} <b>fat</b> percentage decreases with the increasing potato meal. Since <b>the</b> <b>fats</b> <b>in</b> other limbs in hens is related to <b>the</b> abdominal <b>fat</b> content, {{it can be said}} that <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> contents <b>in</b> other limbs of meat are lower as well, compared to those of the control group. We speculated that high fibre content plays a crucial role in this regard. The significance of this result is twofold. First, the lower weight of dressing is likely due to the low content of <b>fat.</b> Second, <b>the</b> reduced <b>fat</b> <b>in</b> meat is definitely of more worth in terms of fetching higher market prices since high animal fat causes elevated blood cholesterol leading to atherosclerosis or heart failure [6]. A detailed investigation is required to relate <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> content <b>in</b> meat to the fibre in diet. It is also suggested to find an optimal level of potato meal in broiler diets to maintain <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> content <b>in</b> poultry meat within acceptable limits.|$|R

25|$|Abbo can {{be viewed}} as a source for the {{collapse}} of Carolingian hegemony in 887–88.

Abbo also regards the empire as Frankish and he himself, though a Neustrian and Parisian, as Frankish as well. He does not present a united West Francia as a more basic political unit than the empire and is therefore seen by some historians as refuting the hypothesis that regional identities led to the breakup of the empire within Abbo's lifetime.|$|E

25|$|Unhomogenized {{milk and}} cream contain {{butterfat}} in microscopic globules. These globules are surrounded by membranes made of phospholipids (fatty acid emulsifiers) and proteins, which prevent <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> <b>in</b> milk from pooling together into a single mass. Butter is produced by agitating cream, which damages these membranes and allows the milk fats to conjoin, separating from {{the other parts of}} the cream. Variations in the production method will create butters with different consistencies, mostly due to the butterfat composition in the finished product. Butter contains fat in three separate forms: free butterfat, butterfat crystals, and undamaged fat globules. In the finished product, different proportions of these forms result in different consistencies within the butter; butters with many crystals are harder than butters dominated by free fats.|$|E
25|$|Gourmets {{generally}} prefer {{white wine}} to red to accompany cheese as its acidity agrees well with <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> <b>in</b> dairy products. Dry wines with mineral aromas such as chardonnay or sauvignon blanc {{bring out the}} milky taste of goat cheese. Aromatic wines, such as Gewurztraminer and some sparkling wines support the strong taste of Washed-rind cheeses (Maroilles, Epoisses, Munster, etc.). Neutral white wines (Castilla-La Mancha, Italian Trebbiano) are well suited to sheep cheese {{and there are also}} Manchego and pecorino romano for a little spicy. The cooked pressed cheeses require a bold wine, woodland. There is perfect agreement between the Comté cheese and the yellow wine of the Jura. Fortified wines are recommended with veined cheeses (Blue or Roquefort). In this case, the cheese mould (Penicillium roqueforti) and the wine (noble rot) form a harmonious whole.|$|E
25|$|To emplace the grafts of {{autologous}} fat-tissue, doctors J. Newman and J. Levin {{designed a}} lipo-injector gun with a gear-driven plunger, which allowed the even injection of autologous fat-tissue {{to the desired}} recipient sites. The control afforded by the lipo-injector gun assisted the plastic surgeon in controlling excessive pressure to <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> <b>in</b> {{the barrel of the}} syringe, thus avoiding over-filling the recipient site. The later-design lipo-injector gun featured a ratchet-gear operation that afforded the surgeon greater control in accurately emplacing grafts of autologous fat to the recipient site; a trigger action injected 0.1cm3 of filler.

25|$|Upon {{standing}} for 12 to 24 hours, fresh milk {{has a tendency}} to separate into a high-fat cream layer on top of a larger, low-fat milk layer. The cream often is sold as a separate product with its own uses. Today the separation of the cream from the milk usually is accomplished rapidly in centrifugal cream separators. The fat globules rise {{to the top of a}} container of milk because fat is less dense than water. The smaller the globules, the more other molecular-level forces prevent this from happening. In fact, the cream rises in cow's milk much more quickly than a simple model would predict: rather than isolated globules, <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> <b>in</b> the milk tends to form into clusters containing about a million globules, held together by a number of minor whey proteins. These clusters rise faster than individual globules can. The fat globules in milk from goats, sheep, and water buffalo do not form clusters as readily and are smaller to begin with, resulting in a slower separation of cream from these milks.|$|E
25|$|The correct {{technique}} maximizes fat graft survival by minimizing cellular trauma {{during the}} liposuction harvesting and the centrifugal refinement, and by injecting <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> <b>in</b> small aliquots (equal measures), not clumps (too-large measures). Injecting minimal-volume aliquots with each pass of the cannula maximizes {{the surface area}} contact, between the grafted fat-tissue and the recipient breast-tissue, because proximity to a vascular system (blood supply) encourages histologic survival and minimizes the potential for fat necrosis. Transplanted autologous fat tissue undergoes histologic changes like those undergone by a bone transplant; if the body accepts the fat-tissue graft, it is replaced with new fat tissue, if the fat-graft dies it is replaced by fibrous tissue. New fat tissue is generated by the activity of a large, wandering histocyte-type cell, which ingests fat and then becomes a fat cell. When the breast-filler fat is injected to the breasts in clumps (too-large measures), fat cells emplaced too distant from blood vessels might die, {{which can lead to}} fat tissue necrosis, causing lumps, calcifications, and the eventual formation of liponecrotic cysts.|$|E
25|$|Butter fills several {{roles in}} baking, {{where it is}} used {{in a similar manner}} as other solid fats like lard, suet, or shortening, but has a flavor that may better {{complement}} sweet baked goods. Many cookie doughs and some cake batters are leavened, at least in part, by creaming butter and sugar together, which introduces air bubbles into the butter. The tiny bubbles locked within the butter expand in the heat of baking and aerate the cookie or cake. Some cookies like shortbread may have no other source of moisture but the water in the butter. Pastries like pie dough incorporate pieces of solid fat into the dough, which become flat layers of fat when the dough is rolled out. During baking, the fat melts away, leaving a flaky texture. Butter, because of its flavor, is a common choice for <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> <b>in</b> such a dough, but it can be more difficult to work with than shortening because of its low melting point. Pastry makers often chill all their ingredients and utensils while working with a butter dough.|$|E
