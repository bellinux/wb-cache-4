5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, I think the media demands <b>that</b> <b>athletes</b> be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E

5|$|Chambers {{reflected}} {{on drug use}} in athletics {{in an interview with}} Olympic gold medallist Sir Matthew Pinsent for the BBC's Inside Sport programme. Chambers claimed there would always be athletes using performance-enhancing drugs because drug testers did not keep pace with advances in science and <b>that</b> <b>athletes</b> who took drugs had an immense advantage over those who remained clean. Chambers was roundly condemned for his comments in the interview by both the press and his former colleagues in the athletics world, including Sir Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Sebastian Coe, although former 100m world record holder Asafa Powell supported Chambers' claims.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the Games, the International Olympic Committee was keen to play down the risk <b>that</b> <b>athletes</b> faced from pollution; however, the {{organizing}} body considered rescheduling of endurance events (such as the cycling road race) if the pollution levels were too high. Athletes partaking in these events can consume 20 times the amount of oxygen as a sedentary person. A higher level of pollution in the air could adversely affect performance, damage or irritate an athlete's lungs, or exacerbate respiratory conditions, such as asthma.|$|E
5|$|The IOC set {{a vision}} for the YOG to be an event {{comprising}} a balance of sports, culture and education. The objective of the Culture and Education Programme (CEP) <b>that</b> <b>athletes</b> participated in was to educate, engage and influence the athletes to develop true sportsmanship and to live by the Olympic values of excellence, respect and friendship, while having fun at the same time.|$|E
50|$|The {{qualification}} {{period for}} athletics was 1 January 2003 to 9 August 2004. For the men's marathon, each National Olympic Committee {{was permitted to}} enter up to three <b>athletes</b> <b>that</b> had run the race in 2:15:00 or faster during the qualification period. If an NOC had no <b>athletes</b> <b>that</b> qualified under <b>that</b> standard, one <b>athlete</b> <b>that</b> had run the race in 2:18:00 or faster could be entered.|$|R
5000|$|The {{last day}} of the championships, his coach {{reported}} to the police <b>that</b> <b>athlete</b> is missing. A police spokesman said: [...] "He took away the passport and personal belongings from a hotel room. For now, the athlete has the status of a missing person".|$|R
50|$|If {{at the end}} of {{the labor}} contract, for the period of 6 months as counted from the end of the contract, and {{provided}} the club continues paying <b>that</b> <b>athleteâ€™s</b> wages, the amount for the penalty clause can be up to 150 times the contracted annual remuneration.|$|R
5|$|The {{athletics}} {{competition at}} the first Olympics featured a men's long jump competition and a women's competition was introduced at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Professional long jumpers typically have strong acceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes must also have a consistent stride {{to allow them to}} take off near the board while still maintaining their maximum speed. In addition to the traditional long jump, a standing long jump contest exists which requires <b>that</b> <b>athletes</b> leap from a static position without a run-up. A men's version of this event featured on the Olympic programme from 1900 to 1912.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} sport, {{the use of}} poles for {{vaulting}} distances was recorded in Fierljeppen contests in the Frisian area of Europe, and vaulting for height was seen at gymnastics competitions in Germany in the 1770s. One of the earliest recorded pole vault competitions was in Cumbria, England in 1843. The basic rules and technique of the event originated in the United States. The rules required <b>that</b> <b>athletes</b> do not move their hands along the pole and athletes began clearing the bar with their feet first and twisting so that the stomach faces the bar. Bamboo poles were introduced in the 20th century and a metal box in the runway for planting the pole became standard. Landing mattresses were introduced in the mid-20th century to protect the athletes who were clearing increasingly greater heights.|$|E
5|$|Runners {{start the}} race from a {{standing}} position along a curved starting line and after hearing the starter's pistol they head towards the innermost track to follow the quickest route to the finish. In 800m races athletes begin at a staggered starting point before the turn in the track and they must remain in their lanes for the first 100m of the race. This rule was introduced {{to reduce the amount}} of physical jostling between runners in the early stages of the race. Physiologically, these middle-distance events demand <b>that</b> <b>athletes</b> have good aerobic and anaerobic energy producing systems, and also that they have strong speed endurance.|$|E
50|$|The {{qualification}} {{period for}} athletics took place from 1 January 2003 to 9 August 2004. For the men's 200 metres, each National Olympic Committee {{was permitted to}} enter up to three <b>athletes</b> <b>that</b> had run the race in 20.59 seconds or faster during the qualification period. If an NOC had no <b>athletes</b> <b>that</b> qualified under <b>that</b> standard, one <b>athlete</b> <b>that</b> had run the race in 20.75 seconds or faster could be entered.|$|R

5|$|The record-breaking {{performance}} {{brought him}} an invite from the Berlin IAAF Golden League meet, although organising group Euromeetings condemned the move. Revelations in Chambers' autobiography Race Against Me brought further controversy {{as the book}} had in-depth accounts of his past drug abuse and claimed drug use remained rife in athletics, estimating that half the American Olympic athletes in Beijing had used illegal substances. Chambers signed a statement with UK Sport, verifying that he believed the information to be true, which brought a close to the organisation's inquiries into his drug use. An IAAF investigation concluded that the book demanded no further action on their part. Olympic gold medallist and anti-drugs campaigner Ed Moses gave his support, saying that Chambers admissions provided a useful insight, but <b>that</b> <b>athletes</b> and administrators remained in denial about {{the high levels of}} doping in athletics.|$|E
25|$|On April 12, WADA intimated <b>that</b> <b>athletes</b> who tested {{positive}} for meldonium before March 1 could avoid bans, but the International Tennis Federation said that Sharapova's case would proceed.

25|$|Athletics {{does not}} have a very high profile in Britain on a week-in week-out basis, but it leaps to {{prominence}} during major championships. The level of attention received by successful British athletes is illustrated by the fact <b>that</b> <b>athletes</b> have won far more BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards than practitioners of any other sport. The governing body of British Athletics is UK Athletics. There are also semi-independent athletics associations in each of the home nations.|$|E
25|$|Triathletes spend {{many hours}} {{training}} for competitions, like other endurance event participants. There are three components {{that have been}} researched to improve endurance sports performance; aerobic capacity, lactate threshold, and economy. Injuries that are incurred from long hours of a single activity are not as common in triathlon {{as they are in}} single sport events. The cross-training effect <b>that</b> <b>athletes</b> achieve from training for one sport by doing a second activity applies to triathlon training. Additional activities that triathletes perform for cross-training benefits are yoga, pilates, and weight training.|$|E

25|$|During {{the celebration}} of the games, an Olympic Truce was enacted so <b>that</b> <b>athletes</b> could travel from their cities to the games in safety. The prizes for the victors were olive leaf wreaths or crowns. The games became a {{political}} tool used by city-states to assert dominance over their rivals. Politicians would announce political alliances at the games, and in times of war, priests would offer sacrifices to the gods for victory. The games were also used to help spread Hellenistic culture throughout the Mediterranean. The Olympics also featured religious celebrations. The statue of Zeus at Olympia was counted as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Sculptors and poets would congregate each olympiad to display their works of art to would-be patrons.|$|E
25|$|Although {{trampoline}} {{competitors are}} highly trained, {{they are also}} attempting to perform complex manoeuvres {{which could lead to}} accidents and falls. Trampolines used in competitions have their springs covered in pads to reduce the chance of injury when landing off the bed. They also have padded end decks, which are the locations <b>that</b> <b>athletes</b> are most likely to fall off the trampoline. The rules for international competitions (updated by FIG in 2006) also require 200mm thick mats on the floor for 2 metres around each trampoline and for there to be four spotters whose task it is to attempt to catch or reduce the impact of an athlete falling {{off the side of the}} trampoline bed. The floor matting rules are typically adopted by national bodies but not always in full; for example in the UK the requirement for National & Regional competition is still 2m but only of 20â€“25mm matting.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} running events are {{held on the}} track which fall into three broad {{distance}} categories: sprints, middle-distance, and long-distance track events. Relay races feature teams comprising four runners each, who must pass a baton to their teammate after a specified distance {{with the aim of}} being the first team to finish. Hurdling events and the steeplechase are a variation upon the flat running theme in <b>that</b> <b>athletes</b> must clear obstacles on the track during the race. The field events come in two types â€“ jumping and throwing competitions. In throwing events, athletes are measured by how far they hurl an implement, with the common events being the shot put, discus, javelin, and hammer throw. There are four common jumping events: the long jump and triple jump are contests measuring the horizontal distance an athlete can jump, while the high jump and pole vault are decided on the height achieved. Combined events, which include the decathlon (typically competed by men) and heptathlon (typically competed by women), are competitions where athletes compete {{in a number of different}} track and field events, with each performance going toward a final points tally.|$|E
