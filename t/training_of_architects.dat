50|$|Columns, or {{at least}} large {{structural}} exterior ones, became much less significant in {{the architecture of the}} Middle Ages. The classical forms were abandoned in both Byzantine architecture and the Romanesque and Gothic architecture or Europe in favour of more flexible forms, with capitals often using various types of foliage decoration, and in the West scenes with figures carved in relief. Renaissance architecture was keen to revive the classical vocabulary and styles, and the informed use and variation of the classical orders remained fundamental to the <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>architects</b> throughout Baroque, Rococo and Neo-classical architecture.|$|E

50|$|The Jan van Eyck Academie {{initially}} took {{up residence}} in the former Sepulchrine church and convent (Bonnefantenklooster) in the Jekerkwartier neighbourhood {{in the center of}} Maastricht. The rather derelict building with sparse natural light was shared with several other institutions. In 1949 the board decided that, as an applied art institution, the academy should incorporate the <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>architects.</b> Consequently, three curricula were set up: architecture, sculpture and fine art (i.e. monumental and decorative painting). Belgian sculptor Oscar Jespers was professor of sculpting (1949-56). Classes of theory, aesthetics and technical education - with a firm scientific basis - were compulsory. There were studios for ceramics and glass art, mosaics, plaster casting and goldsmithing. In 1951 the Jan van Eyck Academie moved to a 17th-century orphanage in Lenculenstraat (later to house the Maastricht Academy of Dramatic Arts).|$|E

[...] From his start with the National Park Service in the 1930s, Peterson continually advocated for <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>architects</b> in the proper restoration of buildings that respected their history, technology, and authenticity. A continual theme of his was the inadequacy of most architects’ work on historic buildings:The shortcomings of architects in the field of historical restoration began long ago. It became clear, even in the days of Latrobe, that the most talented designers could not always be trusted around important landmarks. ... Some of our most stylish architects have proposed—and have carried out—gruesome butcheries on historic buildings. ... The architectural profession should police its own ranks, if for no reason than that many laymen have done their homework in history (as a hobby) and are today well ahead of architects.|$|E

These private studio-schools drew from the works of the masters such as Palladio and Vitruvius. It is un-known which of the English Lords allowed Mr. Harrison to join their private studio-school.

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} 1990 / 91 Edition of the Architects Registration Council of Nigeria (ARCON) {{register}} of architects as source document from which statistical data relevant to teaching, research and overall {{administration of the}} profession of Architecture are extracted. It presents among others, such information as: total number of architects registered under the various categories of registration; the gender distribution of registered architects; the annual distribution of registration by ARCON {{and the distribution of}} local and foreign-trained architects. It is observed that about 72. 94 % of all registered architects were locally trained, thus reinforcing the the notion that the <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>architects</b> has to a large extent been indigenized. Of the locally trained registered architects, ABU Zaria contributed about 42. 57 %, confirming the pioneer position of the school in the local <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>architects.</b> Contrary to general expectation, USA contributed more than the UK in the training of Nigerian architects. It is also that female architects are so few that if an architect is picked at random, the probability of the architect being a female is about 0. 0667. The analysis also reveals that the 1980 s witnessed very erratic registration of architects. For six years (1980, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1986 and 1987), only two architects were registered, an insignificant figure when compared with the yearly average of about 49 registrations...|$|E

50|$|Lienau {{was one of}} a {{relatively}} small group <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> <b>architects,</b> <b>of</b> whom the majority were fairly recent arrivals from Great Britain and the continent. All brought with them to the New World the traditions of the Old, but Lienau differed from his colleagues in one important respect: Molded by his early Danish and North German environment, and by years of study in various German art centers and in Paris, Lienau had a point of view more international than theirs—a rarity in an age of ardent nationalism. Thus, a fusion of traditions enabled him to adapt quickly to life in America and to deal successfully with the demands of an increasingly eclectic age. Another point that should be stressed, since it has long been ignored: It was Lienau, not Richard Morris Hunt, who was the first to bring to the United States a mind and a hand that was shaped, through contact with Henri Labrouste, by the French Beaux-Arts tradition.|$|R
