50|$|A similar {{chaperon}} is worn by {{a figure}} {{in the background of}} van Eyck's Rolin Madonna, and it has also been suggested that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-portrait.</b> Depicting the lines and folds of a chaperon would allow an artist to overtly display his skill. More so, the positioning of its long cornette may directly refer to his occupation as a painter - it is rolled up, perhaps to keep it out of way as he freely applies paint. The emphasis on the sitter's sharp and keenly intelligent shot eyes is a further subtle clue, one found again later in Albrecht Dürer 1500 Self-Portrait.|$|E
50|$|Old Man - Painted by {{the famous}} El Greco (1541 - 7 April 1614), this oil {{painting}} produced in Spain was completed {{around the year}} 1604. This Spanish portrait of this old man during the Late Renaissance resembles the stress this time put on many people. Having painted various styles of Christ and other religious figures, Greco this time portrays {{what seems to be}} himself as this old man. It is not proven that this is a portrait of Greco, but the characteristics in the face and style of his cloths give good indication that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-portrait</b> of the artist himself. You can find this painting in Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City.|$|E
50|$|The central branch {{presents}} two {{modern day}} events: {{the establishment of}} the state of Israel and the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. The relief of the uprising describes many characters, that represent the different Jews in the ghetto: The fighters are seen with guns in their hands, or armed with axes, sticks, and knives. Alongside them appear different characters like an old Jew carrying a Torah scroll, a dead woman with a baby slipping from her arms, a man crying blocking his mouth with his hand, an elderly woman crying over the death of the dead child in her hands and more. Above all these stands a large man, his hands spread out and on his chest a necklace with a star of David pendant. The mans face is turned firmly upwards, in a position that appears praying. In the upper left corner, a warrior is seen swinging a rifle; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-portrait</b> Alkan, who survived the inferno but lost much of his family in the Holocaust.|$|E

5000|$|Soldier at a Game of Chess, initialed [...] "JM" [...] {{and signed}} [...] "JMetzinger" [...] (lower right), <b>is</b> <b>an</b> oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 81.3 x 61 cm (32 x 24 in.). The vertical composition <b>is</b> painted in <b>a</b> geometrically advanced Cubist style, representing a solitary French soldier {{playing a game}} of chess. He wears a military hat (képi) and bears a cigarette in his mouth. Because of this, Joann Moser suggests that <b>this</b> may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-portrait.</b> Images of Metzinger often depicted him with a cigarette in his mouth: consider for example Robert Delaunay's 1906 Portrait of Metzinger (Man with a Tulip); Suzanne Phocas, Portrait de Metzinger, 1926.|$|R
50|$|Soldier at a Game of Chess (in French Soldat jouant aux échecs, or Le Soldat à la partie d'échecs, also {{referred}} to as Joueur d'échecs), <b>is</b> <b>a</b> painting by the French artist Jean Metzinger. While serving as a medical orderly during World War I in Sainte-Menehould, France, Metzinger bore witness to the ravages of war firsthand. Rather than depicting such horrors, Metzinger chose to represent a poilu sitting at a game of chess, smoking a cigarette. The military subject of <b>this</b> painting <b>is</b> possibly <b>a</b> <b>self-portrait.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-portrait</b> collection. But {{it begins}} in {{response}} to texts that I read. Before, I write automatically, nonsensically, intentionally unintentionally; and the engagement with literature directs my writing toward the 'determined' strain that defines this collection. Starting, for instance, with Pound's Chinese translations, used in the earliest poem here, I build my own 'translations. ' And I follow the work of poets that interest me: Miroslav Holub, from whom I borrow lines; John Ashbery, Cesar Vallejo, Kenneth Koch, James Tate, Samuel Beckett, on all whose themes I vary; and more. Certainly, my fascination with nonsense and the absurd continues, but throughout the collection I respond {{more and more to}} what I read, twisting what I can into my own language [...] and I reflect more and more on my own personal and interpersonal conditions, less and less reveling in pure senselessness, although even nonsense is a self-reflection...|$|E
5000|$|Humayun did not {{immediately}} regain his possessions in the Indian subcontinent. While this struggle took place, it <b>was</b> in <b>a</b> Kabul court. Mir Sayyid Ali arrived there in 1549, lived and worked there {{for as long as}} the summer of 1555 Humayun's army defeated in a battle the troops of Sikandar Shah. The Delhi gate was open, and his father Humayun regained the throne. The period of the artist's life in Kabul today carries very few works, among them [...] "Portrait of a young writer".

5000|$|In this 6.5 ft x 9.4 ft piece, a {{large group}} of well-dressed persons {{in the style of the}} 17th century lounge about, picnicking in an idyllic garden. Everyone is finely dressed, exercising their wealth and high class status. This {{demonstrates}} the depth of a full court scene in a recessional manner. Cupids interact with the individuals, bringing mythological figures into a realistic garden scene to produce a fantastical painting. [...] All around the group, symbols of matrimonial love can be found including: the cupids, a pair of doves, flower crowns, music making, and Juno’s peacock. The dogs represent loyalty and fealty. The garden represents Paradise, but also fertility. <b>This</b> painting <b>is</b> <b>an</b> allegory and exaltation of love and marriage, as well as the merry company. In the far-left corner, a male gentleman escorts a woman in all-black towards the entourage. The man is believed to be Rubens, which led to the early identification of <b>this</b> painting to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>self-portrait</b> with friends. The Garden of Love is believed to be celebration of his marriage to Rubens’ wife: Hélène Fourment.|$|R
5000|$|Amos {{felt that}} joining Spiral {{would be useful}} {{because she did not}} know many artists in New York at the time. Amos worked {{full-time}} as a designer during the day, and studied full-time in the evenings, and made time to paint on the weekends. In May 1965, Spiral rented a gallery space at 147 Christopher Street, where they had their first and only exhibit. Amos displayed an etching entitled Without a Feather Boa, which has since <b>been</b> lost. <b>This</b> etching <b>was</b> <b>a</b> nude <b>self-portrait</b> bust that depicted Amos [...] "staring indifferently at the viewer from behind a pair of dark sunglasses." [...] Prior to Spiral, Amos was resistant towards the idea of [...] "black art" [...] and galleries that only showed work by African Americans, but she came to understand that these were often the only options available to black artists at the time, and also learned how to integrate race and sex politics into her work without her work becoming dominated by the process of political engagement.|$|R
40|$|George William Evans <b>was</b> <b>a</b> cartographer, {{explorer}} {{and artist}} who m i v d in New South WaIes in 1802. In 1803 {{he was appointed}} Acting Surveyor General and was sent to find a passage into the interior of New South Wales, becoming the frrst European to successfully cross the Great Dividing Range in 1813. He settled in Van Diemen's Land in 1818, where he compIeted further land surveys. He rehirned to England in 1826, returning to Sydney in 1832 as Drawing Master at The King's School. He made various drawings and watercolours of Sydney and Hobart and a nurnber of his works are held in the Dixson Library, Sydney. <b>This</b> painting <b>is</b> possibly <b>a</b> <b>self-portrait.</b> Shown {{with his hand on}} a globe, perliaps pointing to the areas he surveyed, he <b>is</b> depicted as <b>a</b> gentleman. The rich, dark colours in the work, its highly finished surface and the detailed rendering of the subject locate it in the techniques and styles of traditional portraiture. Coinbining these artistic traditions to create a reaIist portrait, the work suggests a narrative of exploration and travel, and the larger history of the European coIonisation of Australia.

5000|$|David is perturbed, [...] "his {{expression}} mingling {{sadness and}} compassion." [...] The decision to depict him as pensive rather than jubilant creates an unusual psychological bond {{between him and}} Goliath. <b>This</b> bond <b>is</b> further {{complicated by the fact}} that Caravaggio has depicted himself as Goliath, while the model for David is il suo Caravaggino ("his own little Caravaggio"). This most plausibly refers to Cecco del Caravaggio, the artist's studio assistant in Rome some years previously, recorded as the boy [...] "who lay with him." [...] No independent portraits of Cecco are known, making the identification impossible to verify, but [...] "a sexual intimacy between David/model and Goliath/painter seems an inescapable conclusion, however, given that Caravaggio made David's sword appear to project upward, suggestively, between his legs and at an angle that echoes the diagonal linking of the protagonist's gaze to his victim." [...] Alternatively, based on the portrait of Caravaggio done by Ottavio Leoni, <b>this</b> may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> double <b>self-portrait.</b> The young Caravaggio (his own little Caravaggio) wistfully holds the head of the adult Caravaggio. The wild and riotous behavior of the young Caravaggio essentially had destroyed his life as a mature adult, and he reflects with a familiar hermeticism on his own condition in a painting of a related religious subject.|$|R
40|$|A good {{proportion}} of migraine art seems {{to resemble a}} modernist tendency towards the fragmentation of vision and distortion of its subject, as one sees in Cubist portraiture, for example. The representation of the head in migraine art may at first glance seem a little clichéd and obvious. However, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not <b>a</b> literal <b>self-portrait</b> but <b>an</b> attempt to describe {{the inside of my}} head. As such, my migraine art has more in common with expressionism and surrealism. My work usually explores the nature of the visual distortions and the shifting of the migraine experience from wakefulness to sleep. As such, my work generally tends to be more abstract. I prefer to use photography and digital media, and not paint—the idea of pinpricks of light in a lightproof box, or of images that do not really exist seem apposite—though, here, I use paint on canvas. In this piece the migraine experience is explained in the language of expressionism: it is both anti-naturalistic and, to an extent, representational. It has a lot in common with neo-expressionism, in that it is evocative, rather than descriptive. It <b>is</b> <b>an</b> awkward piece that seems on the on the verge of dissolving. www. digitalimagingandphotography. blogspot. co...|$|R
