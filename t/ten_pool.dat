A comprehensive management program relies on keeping bacteria {{out of the water}} (Prevention), removing or killing bacteria in the water (Treatment) and program evaluation (Review). In this study, a preliminary telephone survey of Los Angeles City swimming pool managers was conducted which indicated that potentially serious deficiencies in prevention, treatment and review were occurring. This led to speculation that some of these pools might exceed the maximum allowable levels of total bacteria and total coliform bacteria set by the State of California. <b>Ten</b> <b>pools</b> were non-randomly selected {{to take part in the}} month-long bacteriological study. Samples were collected and analyzed for total bacteria and total coliform bacteria according to Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Waste Water 14 th edition (1975). Nine of the <b>ten</b> <b>pools</b> exceeded the State standard set for total bacteria and three of the ten exceeded the State standard set for coliform bacteria. Only one pool met both standards. It is suggested that this poor performance is due to inadequate sanitary training of managers, inadequate managerial support, and inadequate review processes...|$|R

Based on the transcriptome data, we generated a custom microarray and used this new platform to investigate the transcriptional response in the Syrian hamster liver following intravenous adenovirus type 5 (Ad 5) infection. We found that Ad 5 infection caused a massive change in regulation of liver transcripts, with robust up-regulation of genes involved in the antiviral response, indicating that the innate immune response functions in the host defense against Ad 5 infection of the liver.

Particularly, we study {{the design of}} a vertical slot fishway, that is, a rect-angular channel built on a side of the dam, with a sloping floor, that is divided into a number of pools by baffles with slots. We look for the location and length of the baffles separating the pools, in order to obtain a suitable water velocity: it has to be great enough to attract fish to the channel, but it cannot be so great as to wash fish back downstream or to exhaust them {{to the point where they}} cannot continue their journey upriver. First we pose the problem as a shape optimization problem, where the state system is given by the shallow water (Saint-Venant) equations, the design variables are the location and length of the baffles, and the objective function is related to obtaining a suitable water velocity. Next, by using the “domain derivative ” we give a detailed expression for the gradient of the objective function via the adjoint system. Following, we propose a characteristc-Galerkin method for solving the state system, and two algorithms to solve the optimization problem: a derivative-free algorithm, and a gradient-type method computing the cost gradient by solving the adjoint system with the characteristc-Galerkin method.

40|$|Estuarine {{floodplain}} wetland pools occur {{adjacent to}} marine coasts and estuaries throughout the world. In Australia’s dry tropics and sub-tropics, low and irregular rainfall means estuarine wetland pools are isolated {{for much of}} the time, resulting in varied within-pool conditions, with chemistry ranging from fresh to hypersaline, depending on the balance between freshwater and marine inputs and the time between connections. Varied physical conditions and irregular connectivity provide the potential for substantial faunal difference among pools. The present study compares the compositions and structures of the fish fauna of a broad cross section of estuarine wetland pools adjacent to the estuary of the Fitzroy River, one of the largest rivers in Australia’s dry tropical/subtropical zone. <b>Ten</b> <b>pools</b> were sampled between February 2004 and May 2005. The total species richness was low, with the 6123 fish recorded over the study, comprising only 44 species. This low species richness was reflected at the individual pool level, with a maximum total richness of 25 species in a single pool. Different pools had faunas that differed {{as a function of the}} proportion of the community comprised of marine spawned, compared with freshwater spawned, species. This was a reflection of the extent of connectivity to freshwater and marine systems, which determined both the physical nature of pools and the sources of faunal supply. Despite faunal differences among pools, at a functional level pool fish faunas were dominated by detritivores, regardless of pool type, size, season or connectedness...|$|R

The first confirmed case of HME in Indiana occurred in 1994. Since then, there have been an additional 17 confirmed cases reported from 11 counties. A total of 498 A. americanum and 25 Dermacentor variabilis ticks were collected from counties in southern Indiana during May and June 1998, pooled, and examined {{for the presence of}} E. chaffeensis using nested PCR with primers HE 1 and HE 3, which are specific for the 16 S rRNA gene of E. chaffeensis. <b>Ten</b> <b>pools</b> of adult A. americanum specimens tested positive for E. chaffeensis DNA.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} cellular proteins required for early stages of retroviral replication, a high volume screening with mammalian somatic cells was performed. <b>Ten</b> <b>pools</b> of chemically mutagenized Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K 1) cells were challenged with a murine leukemia virus (MLV) vector pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G), and cells that failed to be transduced were enriched by cell sorting. Each pool yielded a clonally derived cell line with a 5 -fold or greater resistance to virus infection, and five cell lines exhibited a > 50 -fold resistance. These five cell lines were efficiently infected by a human immunodeficiency virus vector pseudotyped with VSV-G. When engineered to express the TVA receptor for subgroup A avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV-A), the five cell lines were resistant to infection with a MLV vector pseudotyped with the ASLV-A envelope protein but were fully susceptible to infection with an ASLV-A vector. Thus, the defect in these cells resides after virus-cell membrane fusion and, unlike those in other mutant cell lines that have been described, is specific for the MLV core. To identify the specific stages of MLV infection that are impaired in the resistant cell lines, real-time quantitative PCR analyses were employed and two phenotypic groups were identified. Viral infection of three cell lines was restricted before reverse transcription; {{in the other two}} cell lines, it was blocked after reverse transcription, nuclear localization, and two-long terminal repeat circle formation but before integration. These data provide genetic evidence that at least two distinct intracellular gene products are required specifically for MLV infection. These cell lines are important tools for the biochemical and genetic analysis of early stages in retrovirus infection...|$|R

RESULTS: Ten of the metrics tested were used to obtain the IBI for runs, six for riffles and <b>ten</b> for <b>pools.</b> The IBI indicated poor conditions for runs and riffles and very poor conditions for pools.
