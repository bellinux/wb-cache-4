40|$|Waves are everywhere, {{from the}} {{distribution}} of cars on a highway to the wave patterns in the ocean. Intriguing phenomena in wave propagation, such as Soliton resonance, kink-antikink interaction, self-focusing, and Peakon generation {{can be used in}} many practical applications leading to novel architectures for signal processing and generation. These E/M based approaches could be particularly useful in the case of Extremely Wide Band (EWB) (DC to more than 100 GHz) circuits and systems where the limited <b>transistor</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency,</b> maximum power efficiency, and breakdown voltage pose serious constraints on the use of conventional circuit techniques. To overcome the limitations of active devices in EWB signal processing and generation, we propose a general class of solutions based on novel circuit topologies inspired by commonly used structures in electromagnetics, and more specifically optics. The proposed methodology is based on nonlinear and/or inhomogeneous one-dimensional (1 D) transmission lines which we have successfully extended to two-dimensional transmission lattices. The principles behind these designs stem from the mathematical theory of linear and nonlinear wave propagation. By analyzing the models for the transmission lines/lattices, we are able to exploit the large body of theory to design circuits, demonstrating the narrowest reported pulse on silicon (2. 5 ps), and for a single integrated-circuit silicon-based amplifier, the highest achieved center frequency of operation (85 GHz) and the highest achieved power output (120 mW) at this frequency. In addition, we have reported the first in-silicon transmission line system capable of sharpening both rising and falling edges of NRZ data by increasing the bandwidth. In the end, we will also present how the same approach can be applied to realize ultra-fast computation systems (such as a sub-nanosecond Fourier and Hankel transformers in silicon) and other structures, leading to a new design discipline we like to call "Optotronics". ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceInterest in {{terahertz}} (THz) {{systems and}} technology has grown significantly {{over the past}} 10 years for their potential in non-invasive imaging, sensing and high-data-rate wireless communication. Waves at THz frequencies present an alternative to x-rays for imaging through paper, cloth, wood, concrete, plastic and many other materials. In contrast to x-rays they are non-ionizing and therefore inherently safe. Applications of THz radiations range from nondestructive testing to medical imaging, security screening of objects and persons. Several groups have also considered using THz waves to transmit data in wireless communications. Wireless THz communications for which THz waves are the free-space carrier of data are recognized as the promising breakthrough solution to achieve data-rates up to 100 Gbps. THz imaging and wireless communication applications suffer, however, {{from the lack of}} fast and low-cost detectors operating at room temperature and in this work we show that graphene based plasma nanotransistors can be a good alternative.. Nanotransistors offer great prospect for the development of innovative THz detectors. The interest in using field-effect transistors for THz applications was initiated by the theoretical work of Dyakonov and Shur, who predicted that the nonlinear properties of the 2 D plasma in the transistor channel can be used for detection of THz waves at frequencies significantly higher than the <b>transistor</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency.</b> Graphene field-effect nanotransistors were recently demonstrated showing maturity of graphene microelectronics. In this paper, we present extensive studies on first THz detectors based on monolayer and bilayer graphene field effect transistors. The specific detection sign reversal related to the graphene Dirac point change of electron to hole conductivity is clearly demonstrated. We show that the detectors consisting of a gated 2 D massless fermion gas as rectifying element and an integrated coupling antenna achieve a responsivity above 1. 2 V/W (1. 3 mA/W) in photovoltage and photocurrent mode respectively, and a noise equivalent power below 2 10 - 9 W/Hz 0. 5 We show also that these detectors can operating as sensitive room-temperature broadband THz detectors in THz imaging systems.

Bit-error-rate-measurements at data rates up to 10 Gbps are performed for different input THz powers. As expected, bit error rates degrade as data rate increases. However, degraded communication is observed at some specific data rates. This effect is probably due to deleterious cavity effects and/or impedance mismatches.

The Hard Disk drive industry is looking for developments in the read channel chip to push the data rates to higher speed, along with a low voltage and low cost solution. Read channel requires high-speed linear phase filters to meet these objectives. The primary objective of this project is to design, layout, and characterize a 4 th-order continuous-time equiripple linear phase filter with automatic tuning system. The main requirements for design are high speed, low group delay variations, good linearity and power efficiency.

40|$|Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) {{has been}} {{proposed}} for optical fibre networks to a achieve high-speed connectivity, asynchronous operation and network control simplifications. Traditionally, all-optical devices have been proposed to encode, decode and process CDMA signals because the bandwidth in the optical medium is higher than electronic processing techniques. Today's advances in integrated circuit technologies coupled with bandwidth efficient circuit topologies, may provide robust alternatives for CDMA over fibre applications. This thesis overs two areas of work. First, a new circuit for encoding and decoding incoherent CDMA signals in the electrical domain is proposed. This structure makes use of the high bandwidth of distributed amplifier-like topologies to achieve very wideband operation.

40|$|With quality factors (Q) often {{exceeding}} 10, 000, vibrating micromechanical resonators {{have emerged}} as leading candidates for on-chip versions of high-Q resonators used in wireless communications systems, sensor networks, and clocking sources in microprocessors. However, extending the frequency of MEMS resonators generally entails scaling of resonator dimensions leading to increased motional impedance. In this dissertation, I introduce a new transduction mechanism using dielectric materials to improve performance and increase frequency of silicon-based RF acoustic resonators. Traditionally, electrostatically transduced mechanical resonators have used air-gap capacitors for driving and sensing vibrations in the structure. To increase transduction efficiency, facilitate fabrication, and enable GHz frequencies of operation, it is desirable to replace air-gap transducers with dielectric films. In my doctoral work, I designed, fabricated, and demonstrated dielectrically transduced silicon bulk-mode resonators up to 6. 2 GHz, marking the highest acoustic frequency measured in silicon to date. The concept of internal dielectric transduction is introduced, in which dielectric transducers are incorporated directly into the resonator body. With dielectric films positioned at points of maximum strain in the resonator, this transduction improves in efficiency with increasing frequency, enabling resonator scaling to previously unattainable frequencies. Using internal dielectric transduction, longitudinal-mode resonators exhibited the highest frequency-quality factor (f. Q) product in silicon to date at 5. 1 x 10 exp(13) s exp(- 1). These resonators were measured by capacitively driving and sensing acoustic vibrations in the device. However, capacitive detection often requires 3 -port scalar mixer measurement, complicating monolithic integration of the resonators with CMOS circuits. The internal dielectric bulk-mode resonators can be utilized in a 2 -port configuration with capacitive drive and piezoresistive detection, in which carrier mobility is dynamically modulated by elastic waves in the resonator. Piezoresistive sensing of silicon-based dielectrically transduced resonators was demonstrated with 1. 6 % frequency tuning and control of piezoresistive transconductance gm by varying the current flowing through the device. Resonant frequency, determined by lithographically defined dimensions, was demonstrated over a wide frequency range. These degrees of freedom enable acoustic resonators spanning a large range of frequencies on a single chip, despite design restrictions of the CMOS process. As we scale to deep sub-micron (DSM) technology, <b>transistor</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequencies</b> increase, enabling the design of CMOS circuits for RF and mm-wave applications greater than 60 GHz. However, DSM transistors have limited gain and integrated passives demonstrate low Q, resulting in poor efficiency. A successful transition into DSM CMOS requires enhanced-gain and high-Q components operating at microwave frequencies. In this work, a merged NEMS-CMOS device is introduced that can function as a building block to enhance the performance of RF circuits. The device, termed the Resonant Body Transistor (RBT), consists of a field effect transistor embedded {{in the body of}} a high-frequency NEMS resonator implementing internal dielectric transduction. The results of this work indicate improved resonator performance with increased frequency, providing a means of scaling MEMS resonators to previously unattainable frequencies in silicon. With the transduction methods developed in this work, a hybrid NEMSCMOS RBT enables low-power, narrow-bandwidth low noise amplifier design for transceivers and low phase-noise oscillator arrays for clock generation and temperature sensing in microprocessors...|$|R

40|$|Advances in <b>transistors</b> with <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequencies</b> > 400 GHz have fuelled {{interest}} in security, imaging and telecommunications applications operating well above 100 GHz. However, {{further development of}} passive networks has become vital in developing such systems, as traditional coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission lines, the most fundamental passive component, exhibit high losses in the millimetre and sub-millimetre wave regime. This work investigates novel, practical, low loss, transmission lines for frequencies above 100 GHz and high-Q passive components composed of these lines. At these frequencies, transmission line losses are primarily due {{to the influence of}} the waveguide substrate. We therefore focus on structures which elevate transmission line traces above the substrate using air-bridge technology. Thorough analysis is performed on a range of elevated structures, and analytic / semi-analytic formulae for component figures of merit obtained. These, along with comprehensive 2 and 3 D simulations are used to design discrete lines and distributed passive networks, with a focus on the 140 - 320 GHz frequency range. Innovative fabrication and detailed characterisation of the components are also carried out. The key result is the development of a novel MMIC compatible transmission line structure, Elevated-Grounded CPW, with a relatively simple fabrication process. EGCPW provides high substrate isolation, resulting in a low losses and high-quality passive networks. 50 Ω EGCPW transmission line shows an insertion loss of 2. 5 dB/mm at 320 GHz, 2. 5 dB/mm less than CPW. EGCPW passive networks, including resonators and filters, show higher performance than both conventional CPW and other forms of elevated CPW. 30 - 80 % improvements in quality factor are shown, and an EGCPW band-pass filter with the centre frequency of 220 GHz shows a 12 % reduction in bandwidth and 4. 5 dB reduced in-band loss compared with its CPW counterpart. Due to the superior performance of MMIC-compatible EGCPW, as well as its ability to support a wide range of characteristic impedances, this structure is suggested as a candidate for widespread use in sub-millimetre wave circuits in order to increase efficiency and reduce losses.

The time constant range in VLF is from 90  s to 119.1  s, and the calculated <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> is from 1.34 × 10 − 3 to 1.77 × 10 − 3  Hz. The <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> of 1.56 [*]×[*] 10 − 3  Hz in WPD can be obtained by (4). The max instantaneous frequency of 0.97 [*]×[*] 10 − 3 Hz in EMD can be acquired by the decomposition and HHT of grid-connected wind power. Similarly, the max instantaneous frequency of 8.65 [*]×[*] 10 − 3  Hz in MPC can also be acquired.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Low pass {{filters are}} widely used in {{telecommunications}} {{for a variety of}} commercial and military applications. The design and simulation technology differs according to the <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency.</b> In this work we design, simulate and compare various types of passive Butterworth filters, regarding their order and the type of topology used, for RF frequencies using lumped components with <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> around 3 KHz. Then, low frequencies are transferred to microwave frequencies and a low pass even order Butterworth microwave filter, using step impedance microstrip lines with <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> around 3 GHz is analyzed, designed and simulated...|$|R

A filter with such a <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> can eliminate noises {{and at the same time}} reserve the useful low order harmonics.|$|R
