5|$|Likely of Balkan origin, Basiliscus was {{the brother}} of Aelia Verina, wife of Leo I. It {{has been argued that}} Basiliscus was uncle to the {{chieftain}} of the Heruli, Odoacer.

However, not all scholars accept <b>this</b> <b>interpretation,</b> since sources do not say anything about the foreign origin of Basiliscus.

Other physicists attempted to construct object-based models which did away with this superluminal communication, but Bell's theorem later proved this to be impossible. For this reason, according to Herbert, neorealism is rejected by most of the physics establishment.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a relativistic symmetrical {{interpretation of the}} Dirac equation in 1 + 1 dimensions which predicts no zitterbewegung for a free spin- 1 2 particle.

To-gether with an earlier paper describing a relativistic symmetrical interpretation of the Klein-Gordon equation [1], <b>this</b> new <b>interpretation</b> resolves some inconsistencies in the conventional interpreta-tions of both equations. <b>This</b> new <b>interpretation</b> also makes several experimental predictions that differ from the conventional interpretation of the Dirac equation. 1...|$|R
