5|$|Cid {{is confronted}} by Vaan, Balthier and {{company at the}} Draklor Laboratory, which results in a fight that Cid loses. Cid survives the {{encounter}} and flees. Cid goes to the Pharos lighthouse to invoke the Sun-Cryst's full power, revealing himself to the main characters there once Gabranth is defeated. Enraged, Gabranth tries to attack Cid, who teleports out of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> Venat throws the judge against a wall. Cid fights Vaan, Balthier {{and the rest of}} the party once again, and again loses. Cid dies after the battle, dissolving into energy absorbed by the Sun-Cryst before it is destroyed and fully activates his final airship, the Bahamut. A character named Cid appears or is mentioned in every main Final Fantasy. He made his debut appearance in Final Fantasy II, though this appearance is the first Final Fantasy game to feature a Cid character as a villain. Cid was voiced by John Rafter Lee in English and by Chikao Ōtsuka in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill {{retained}} {{his place}} for the 1964 tour to England, and scored a century against Western Australia for the touring squad before departing for the northern hemisphere. After failing to pass 16 {{in his first two}} outings, he struck form against Glamorgan, scoring 65 and an unbeaten 109. He then added 151 and 17 not out, leading <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> the Australians defeated the MCC by nine wickets in a dress rehearsal for the Tests. However, O'Neill scored 98 in the first four innings of the opening two Tests and was forced out of the Third Test with a knee injury, the only non-draw of the series, which Australia won. Nevertheless, he passed 50 {{in each of the four}} tour matches during this period, including a 134 against Yorkshire and 90 against Northamptonshire.|$|E
5|$|The Persian army {{seems to}} have made slow {{progress}} through Thrace and Macedon. News of the imminent Persian approach eventually reached Greece in August thanks to a Greek spy. At {{this time of year}} the Spartans, de facto military leaders of the alliance, were celebrating the festival of Carneia. During the Carneia, military activity was forbidden by Spartan law; the Spartans had arrived too late at the Battle of Marathon because of this requirement. It was also the time of the Olympic Games, and therefore the Olympic truce, and thus it would have been doubly sacrilegious for the whole Spartan army to march to war. On this occasion, the ephors decided the urgency was sufficiently great to justify an advance expedition to block the pass, under one of its kings, Leonidas I. Leonidas took with him the 300 men of the royal bodyguard, the Hippeis. This expedition was to try to gather as many other Greek soldiers along <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> possible and to await the arrival of the main Spartan army.|$|E

5|$|The season {{came down}} to a two-game set with the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium, with the home team one game behind and needing to win both. Stengel, during the 1949 season, had shown himself more apt than his peers {{to bring in a}} relief pitcher, and when during the first game, starter Allie Reynolds gave up the first two runs in the third inning, the manager brought in Joe Page. Though Page walked in two more runs, he shut out the Red Sox the rest of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> the Yankees came back to win, 5–4. This set up a winner-take-all game for the league title. The Yankees took a 5–0 lead before Boston scored three in the ninth, but Vic Raschi was able to prevent further damage, giving the Yankees the pennant, Stengel's first as a major league manager.|$|E
5|$|That season, Brodeur won 43 {{games for}} the second time in his career, and the Devils {{finished}} with the fourth spot in the Eastern Conference after losing the division to the Flyers by two points. Brodeur helped the Devils sweep the Florida Panthers in the first round, giving up only six goals in four games. In the next round against the Toronto Maple Leafs he recorded two shutouts, including one in the final game of the series as the Devils went on to win four games to two, setting up a showdown with rival Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Flyers took a 3–1 series lead and had home ice to close out the series, but Brodeur gave up only one goal in each of the remaining three games of the series, propelling the Devils to a comeback series victory in 7 games. They went on to play the Dallas Stars in the Stanley Cup Final, who had a higher seed but fewer regular season points, giving the Devils home ice advantage in the series. After taking game one with a 7-goal rally against Dallas, the Devils were led by Brodeur the rest of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> he gave up only six goals in the next five games, giving the team their second Stanley Cup Championship in six years.|$|E

25|$|By all accounts, Vito Genovese was angling {{to become}} boss of all bosses, and {{believed}} that Gambino would support him. Gambino, however, had his own mind. He secretly joined forces with Charles Luciano and Frank Costello to get Genovese out of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> well. Gambino helped trick Genovese into a lucrative drug deal, then paid a small-time Puerto Rican dealer to testify against him. In April 1959, Genovese was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison, where he died in 1969.|$|E

25|$|Seleucus {{nominated}} his son Antiochus I as his co-ruler and viceroy of {{the eastern}} provinces in 292 BC, the vast extent of the empire seeming to require a double government. In 294 BC Stratonice married her stepson Antiochus. Seleucus reportedly instigated the marriage after discovering that his son {{was in danger of}} dying of lovesickness. Seleucus was thus able to get Stratonice out of <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>as</b> her father Demetrius had now become king of Macedonia.|$|E
25|$|On 5 March, Operation Uvda was {{launched}} following {{nearly a month}} of reconnaissance, {{with the goal of}} securing the Southern Negev from Jordan. The IDF entered and secured the territory, but did not meet significant resistance along <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>as</b> the area was already designated {{to be part of the}} Jewish state in the UN Partition Plan, and the operation meant to establish Israeli sovereignty over the territory rather than actually conquer it. The Golani, Negev, and Alexandroni brigades participated in the operation, together with some smaller units and with naval support.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the tour, a major {{incident}} occurred during their first concert at the Oakland Coliseum on 23 July 1977. Upon arrival at the stadium, it was alleged that Bindon pushed a member of promoter Bill Graham's stage crew out of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> the band entered the stadium via a backstage ramp. Tension had been simmering between Graham's staff and Led Zeppelin's security team during the day, and as Grant and Bindon were walking down the ramp near {{the end of the}} concert, words were exchanged with stage crew chief Jim Downey, which resulted in Bindon knocking Downey unconscious.|$|E

Observation and theoretical evidence suggest that the Magellanic Clouds have both been greatly distorted by tidal interaction with <b>the</b> Milky <b>Way</b> <b>as</b> they travel close to it. The LMC maintains a very clear spiral structure in radio-telescope images of neutral hydrogen. Streams of neutral hydrogen connect them to <b>the</b> Milky <b>Way</b> and to each other, and both resemble disrupted barred spiral galaxies.

Throughout 1986, Hogan made successful title defenses against challengers such as Terry Funk, Don Muraco, King Kong Bundy (in a steel cage match at WrestleMania 2), Paul Orndorff, and Hercules Hernandez.|$|E

Coming from a shaken family and a mundane everyday life, she is eager to explore the brand new setting that awaits her in Connecticut. Unexpectedly, the center of her fascination soon becomes a famed dorm known as Billings House and the posh girls who reside there—Noelle, Ariana, Kiran, and Taylor. In time, Reed pines to become a Billings Girl herself, and is faced with many tests and compromises along <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>As</b> the series progresses, several additional characters and their histories are introduced and focused upon.|$|E

Cars carrying dozens of officers from both the Los Angeles Police and Sheriff’s Department rushed to the area. Although no sign of the threat that brought all this about materialized, for many days after the canyon resembled an armed camp.|$|E

25|$|The 1920s saw much indecisiveness and {{disputes}} over what route to take between Waipara and Wharanui. The Culverden line now ran all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> Waiau and some work {{took place on}} a line to link Waiau with Kaikoura, {{but after a few}} kilometres of formation was made, work came to a halt. The coastal route was then chosen and work had only just restarted when the Great Depression began and brought about more severe delays. Fortunes improved in 1936 sufficiently to allow a resumption of progress, and a more coastal route out of Parnassus than the Leader Valley route was chosen. World War II brought even more delays, but this time, construction progressed through wartime and the Main North Line was finally completed when the northern and southern ends met at Kaikoura on 15 December 1945.|$|E
