25|$|The show often {{includes}} strong, brassy, long-suffering {{women who}} exhibit diva-like behaviour and stoically battle through {{an array of}} tragedy and misfortune. Such characters include Angie Watts, Kathy Beale, Sharon Watts, Pat Butcher, Denise Fox and Tanya Branning. Conversely there are female characters who handle tragedy less well, depicted as eternal victims and endless sufferers, who include Sue Osman, Little Mo Mitchell, Laura Beale, Lisa Fowler, Ronnie Mitchell and Linda Carter. The 'tart with a heart' is another recurring character, often popular with viewers. Often their promiscuity masks a hidden vulnerability and a desire <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>loved.</b> Such characters have included Pat Butcher (though in her latter years, this changed), Tiffany Mitchell, Kat Slater, Stacey Slater, Dawn Swann and Roxy Mitchell.|$|E

25|$|Asher's scars are {{hesitant}} {{around the}} face and groin, noted by Anita that {{it was as if}} the Priests flinched at the destruction of such beauty. The Priests (never said which denomination, but it is assumed Catholic) used Holy Water in an attempt to save Asher's soul (from what is never said, either). Asher is moody with a sadistic mean streak, lashing out at everyone in his fits of melancholic pain. He wants most <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>loved</b> and devoted by Jean-Claude, more a lover of men than women. Asher knows that it is through Anita's attraction to him combined with Jean-Claude's that Jean-Claude returns the love. Without Anita's acceptance, Jean-Claude could never bring himself to nearly be consumed for want of Asher again. That coupled with the incident of Asher nearly bleeding Anita to death during their first and only exclusive sexual experience leads to Asher's emotional neglect. Neither Anita nor Jean-Claude trust themselves alone with Asher, but as a trio, they live in nearly perfect love.|$|E

It was digitally released on 30 June 2017 through Alexandra Stan Records, her own label, due to the singer's desire to work independently.

500|$|The role made Papps a {{favourite}} {{with the}} viewers, won him many fans {{and made him}} famous. The Seven Network received fan mail for Papps before the series even debuted.

He thought it was [...] "nice <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>loved</b> and accepted" [...] but the fame the role generated became an [...] "intrusion" [...] on his privacy.

500|$|Walpole {{was sent}} to England, where {{according}} to his biographer Rupert Hart-Davis {{the next ten years}} were the unhappiest time of Walpole's life. He first attended a preparatory school in Truro. Though he missed his family and felt lonely he was reasonably happy, but he moved to Sir William Borlase's Grammar School in Marlow in 1895, where he was bullied, frightened and miserable. He later said, [...] "The food was inadequate, the morality was 'twisted', and Terror – sheer, stark unblinking Terror – stared down every one of its passages... The excessive desire <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>loved</b> that has always played so enormous a part in my life was bred largely, I think, from the neglect I suffered there".|$|E

500|$|Kills {{discussed}} Perfectionist during 2013 interviews. She {{revealed that}} after having lived a deplorable life in London, her ambitions and dreams influenced the album's lyrics. [...] "I {{was not as}} aware of... how I was", she stated. [...] "I almost {{had a bit of}} fear where everybody wants <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>loved,</b> everybody wants to be understood in a way that's not full of judgment or blame. So I put all of myself into the album and then [...] bits out." [...] That year, Corner hailed Perfectionist as [...] "one of the most underrated pop collections in recent memory", and Idolator's Sam Lansky opined that although it had [...] "killer" [...] choruses, the album suffered from excessive similarities to other artists.|$|E
500|$|On the {{difference}} between the obscure and the renowned in the poem, scholar David Cecil argued, [...] "Death, he perceives, dwarfs human differences. There is not much to choose between the great and the humble, once they are in the grave. It may be that there never was; it may be that in the obscure graveyard lie those who but for circumstance would have been as famous as Milton and Hampden." [...] However, death is not completely democratic because [...] "if circumstances prevented them from achieving great fame, circumstances also saved them from committing great crimes. Yet there is a special pathos in these obscure tombs; the crude inscriptions on the clumsy monuments are so poignant a reminder of the vain longing of all men, however humble, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>loved</b> and to be remembered." ...|$|E
500|$|Sexuality {{is one of}} {{the primary}} themes of the novel. Letters by Brooke {{recently}} rediscovered by historians expressed much conflict within himself about his own sexuality. This same sexual conflict becomes a major element of Dawson's novel. Nell is consistently shocked by Brooke's sexual desires and encounters throughout the novel, {{while at the same time}} Brooke is confused by his lustful desires for Nell and his desire to court sexually constrained upper-class women. Brooke has other causes of internal conflict. In his search for the right person to lose his virginity to, he has a homosexual encounter almost out of desperation. The continual conflict between a desire <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>loved,</b> and the inability to find a lover is ironic when compared to the title of the novel and poem which inspired the novel: Brooke is clearly not a [...] "great lover".|$|E
