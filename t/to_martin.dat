5|$|The {{building}} site {{has been the}} subject of several recent redevelopment proposals, including a 2008 plan to demolish the building that was halted after a U.S. District Court ruling. After ownership of the Federal Reserve Bank Building was transferred to the General Services Administration in 2013, it was auctioned <b>to</b> <b>Martin</b> Selig Real Estate in 2015 for $16 million; the firm later announced plans to build a 48-story mixed-use skyscraper atop the existing building, but scaled back the project to only seven floors.|$|E
5|$|The film {{is based}} on the novel of the same name by Richard Price; its {{screenplay}} was written by Philip Kaufman and his wife Rose.

From San Cristobal, another boat took them to the New Hebrides and from there they eventually rejoined U.S. forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{unresolved}} larger narrative arc encourages {{speculation about}} future story events. According <b>to</b> <b>Martin,</b> {{much of the}} key to Ice and Fire future lies over a dozen years in the fictional past, of which each volume reveals more. Events planned from the beginning are foreshadowed, although Martin is careful {{not to make the}} story predictable. The viewpoint characters, who serve as unreliable narrators, may clarify or provide different perspectives on past events. Therefore, what the readers believe to be true may not necessarily be true.|$|E
5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was {{initially}} signposted in 1919, the highway between Allegan and Martin {{was part of}} M-89.

5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Martin</b> Noth, {{a scholar}} of the Hebrew Bible, the {{narratives}} of Isaac date back to an older cultural stage {{than that of the}} West-Jordanian Jacob. At that era, the Israelite tribes were not yet sedentary. In the course of looking for grazing areas, they had come in contact in southern Philistia with the inhabitants of the settled countryside. The biblical historian A. Jopsen believes in the connection between the Isaac traditions and the north, and in support of this theory adduces Amos 7:9 ("the high places of Isaac").|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Martin</b> Špegelj, the Defence Minister of Croatia between August 1990 and July 1991, the Croatian Army was {{informed}} by a Yugoslav Air Force Željava Air Base-based source about a top secret mission {{prepared for the}} next day, but Špegelj claims that the information was not taken seriously {{due to lack of}} details. Other sources assert that a warning was conveyed by Croatian security and intelligence system services, indicating the Soviet Union and its then-president Mikhail Gorbachev as the source of the information. At midnight during the night of the 67 October, the Soviet ambassador to Belgrade was reported to have received government instructions to warn the Yugoslav military against attacking Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|After two {{consecutive}} third-place finishes, Martin was victorious in 2011, beating Bradley Wiggins and defending champion Cancellara by {{a minute and}} fifteen seconds. He retained the rainbow jersey the following year; however, the margin of victory was considerably smaller as he beat the American Taylor Phinney by five seconds. In 2013, Martin won the event for a third consecutive time, again overcoming Wiggins and Cancellara. After two runner-up finishes, Wiggins prevented Martin's fourth successive win in the following season, taking the world title for the first time. Wiggins decided not {{to take part in}} 2015, focusing instead on breaking the hour record. In his absence, the winner was Belarussian cyclist Vasil Kiryienka, who came in third <b>to</b> <b>Martin</b> in 2012, beating Italy's Adriano Malori and France's Jérôme Coppel.|$|E
50|$|Martins, despite {{playing in}} the Indian I-League, {{believes}} that he has {{what it takes to}} play for his birth country Nigeria. According <b>to</b> <b>Martins</b> {{he had a chance to}} play for the Nigerian U20s but AFC Cup commitments and the Dempo president failing <b>to</b> tell <b>Martins</b> on time stopped that from happening. Martins also said that at one point an official from the Nigeria Football Federation arrived in India to watch him play a match and that he would be watching Martins.|$|R

5|$|He {{utilised}} unique tactical formations, {{which earned}} him comparisons <b>to</b> <b>Martin</b> O'Neill. He was particularly experimental {{with the front}} line, and was willing to use the loan market to bring in fresh talent. On 24 March, it was announced Gannon would leave Peterborough {{at the end of}} the season. Unable to avoid relegation despite a vast upturn in results, he announced that family commitments made him unwilling to stay for longer. Gannon had been satisfied with the board's contract offer, but his family still resided in Stockport. He was replaced by Gary Johnson on 6 April, following Gannon's own recommendation of Johnson. Though Gannon insisted that this was not ultimately his decision, but instead was down to the board. Striker Liam Dickinson was sad to seem him go, and told the media that Gannon would have little trouble finding a new management post.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, the routing from Allegan <b>to</b> <b>Martin</b> {{was removed}} and renumbered M-118, and M-40 was {{extended}} to the north out of Allegan along M-89 and its modern routing to a new terminus in Holland ending at US31. By the middle of 1960, the US131 was opened {{as far south as}} Martin; the section of M-118 between the new freeway and the old routing was used as a connector until the next section south to Plainwell opened the next year. After this next freeway segment was opened, M-118 was truncated to end at the freeway.|$|E
5|$|In the July 15, 2008 Democratic primary election, Jones won a {{plurality}} of votes in the Democratic primary. However, Georgia law requires a majority; if no majority is reached by a candidate, the two top vote-getters must face {{one another in a}} runoff. On August 5, 2008 Jones lost the run-off election to Jim Martin by a margin of 20 points. Jones unexpectedly lost <b>to</b> <b>Martin</b> in his home base of Dekalb County. Jones had lost support within the black community before the runoff election, and only captured two-thirds of the black vote in the head to head match up against Martin. The black turnout in the run-off was also substantially lower than the initial primary election, further hurting Vernon Jones' chances in the runoff.|$|E
50|$|It's been {{revealed}} that Angel wants <b>to</b> recruit <b>Martin</b> <b>to</b> his gang. When Martin constantly rebuffs Angel, {{it only makes}} him even more mad and threats soon pose.

With Maria working, Jacques decides <b>to</b> take <b>Martin</b> <b>to</b> a local martial arts school run by good friend Henry, who {{is the one who}} convinced the Olympic Committee to bring Jacques to L.A. Henry knew Martin's father Pedro, who had protested vehemently against Angel and his gang and was ultimately murdered by Angel, which Martin doesn't know. Jacques decides <b>to</b> teach <b>Martin</b> some self-defense along with Henry and tells him the ramifications of what can and will happen should <b>Martin</b> decide <b>to</b> join Angel's gang.|$|R

50|$|Finally, Martins, {{the last}} {{remaining}} independent regional bank, itself succumbed to acquisition. A proposed three-way merger between Barclays, Lloyds Bank and Martins {{was rejected by the}} Monopolies Commission but no objection was raised <b>to</b> <b>Martins</b> being acquired by Barclays alone. In 1969 the Liverpool-based banklost its independence to Barclays.|$|R
