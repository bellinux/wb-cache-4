The term eTMF encompasses strategies, methods and tools used throughout the lifecycle of the clinical trial regulated content. [...] An eTMF system consists of software and hardware that facilitates the management of regulated clinical trial content.

[...] The TMF has historically been composed primarily of paper documents, images and media captured centrally in physical file cabinets.|$|E
2500|$|The {{definition}} of what comprises an eTMF {{is defined by the}} regulatory agency with jurisdiction over the clinical trial. [...] In Europe, the EMA has recently defined an eTMF as follows: [...] 'An eTMF can contain digital documents in their original format, potentially with digital signatures, or records that have been converted from another format, such as paper documents that have been converted to digital images, which may contain wet-ink signatures. The metadata applied to documents is recommended be formally defined to ensure consistency across all documents.' [...] At the time of this article no formal US FDA requirement exists for the use of an eTMF system in a clinical trial. [...] However, if a clinical trial elects to store <b>trial</b> <b>master</b> <b>file</b> 'essential documents' in electronic format, then the eTMF system used to store those files is subject to regulatory controls specified under FDA Title 21 CFR Part 11.|$|E

In the European Union (EU), TMFs have a different definition and set of requirements than in the US. The EU Commission's Directive 2005/28/EC 63 Chapter 4 states 'the <b>trial</b> <b>master</b> <b>file</b> shall consist of essential documents, which enable both the conduct of a clinical trial {{and the quality of the}} data produced to be evaluated. Those documents shall show whether the investigator and the sponsor have complied with the principles and guidelines of good clinical practice and with the applicable requirements.' The US FDA recognizes the use of TMFs as a significant piece of information but unlike the EU with its TMF regulation, there is no formal requirement for maintenance of essential documents in a TMF in US-based clinical trials in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations. However, since the U.S. FDA require trials to be conducted in compliance with ICH GCP, there is an expectation that a <b>trial</b> <b>master</b> <b>file</b> will be created and maintained in accordance with those guidelines.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{clinical}} trial involving human subjects, a set of content known as a <b>trial</b> <b>master</b> <b>file</b> (TMF) must be produced in accordance with applicable international and local regulations. TMFs are a collection of documents and other artifacts which [...] "individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a trial {{and the quality of}} the data produced. These documents serve to demonstrate the compliance of the investigator, sponsor and monitor with the standards of Good Clinical Practice and with all applicable regulatory requirements."Historically, TMFs have been paper-based content sets stored in physical file cabinets, central file rooms, or shelved in binders. The size and complexity of a TMF is in direct proportion to the length and complexity of the trial. [...] The TMF is actively built during a trial, and must be maintained during a post-trial period for possible regulatory agency inspection in alignment with GCP and local country regulations. Traditionally, the TMF content names and requirements varies from sponsor to sponsor, creating a high degree of variability and inconsistency.|$|E

Clinical trial sponsors face significant challenges in assembling the TMF, especially when dealing with large, international, multicenter studies; despite all newly introduced archiving techniques it {{is becoming more and}} more difficult to ensure that the TMF is complete. This is directly reflected in the number of inspection findings reported and published by the EMA in 2014. Based on quality risk management principles in clinical trials the authors defined the quality expectations for the different document types in a TMF and furthermore defined tolerance limits for missing documents. This publication provides guidance on what type of documents and processes are most important, and in consequence, indicates on which documents and processes trial team staff should focus in order to achieve a high-quality TMF.
