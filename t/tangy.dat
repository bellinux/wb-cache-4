25|$|However, {{while it}} has flavor/texture {{components}} {{of each of the}} above, it is not prepared from a meat emulsion. Thus, it has the grainy consistency of cooked salami or kielbasa rather than that of bologna or hot dogs. In fact, smoked kielbasa might be the closest nationwide comparison. But, pork roll is a bit sweeter, and that extra sugar becomes caramelized when it is fried or grilled, which adds to the final flavor. Also, the <b>tangy</b> variety includes lactic acid starter culture in its preparation, which adds a sour flavor component like some dry cured salami's or pepperoni.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the many}} types of white wine, dry white wine is the most common. More or less {{aromatic}} and <b>tangy,</b> it {{is derived from the}} complete fermentation of the wort. Sweet wines, on the other hand, are produced by interrupting the fermentation before all the grape sugars are converted into alcohol; this is called Mutage or fortification. The methods of enriching wort with sugar are multiple: on-ripening on the vine, passerillage (straining), or the use of Noble rot. Sparkling wines, which are mostly white, are wines where the carbon dioxide from the fermentation is kept dissolved in the wine and becomes gas when the bottle is opened.|$|E
25|$|Many {{flavourings}} {{are added}} to varieties of tea during processing. Among the best known are Chinese jasmine tea, with jasmine oil or flowers, the spices in Indian masala chai, and Earl Grey tea, which contains oil of bergamot. A great range of modern flavours {{have been added to}} these traditional ones. In eastern India, people also drink lemon tea or lemon masala tea. Lemon tea simply contains hot tea with lemon juice and sugar. Masala lemon tea contains hot tea with roasted cumin seed powder, lemon juice, black salt and sugar, which gives it a <b>tangy,</b> spicy taste. Adding a piece of ginger when brewing tea is a popular habit of Sri Lankans, who also use other types of spices such as cinnamon to sweeten the aroma.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tangier</b> {{disease is}} a rare {{familial}} disorder characterized by extremely low levels of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and high density lipoproteins (HDL). In normal subjects, proapoA-I is secreted into plasma and converted to mature apoA-I by the cleavage of the amino-terminal six amino acids with the major isoprotein in plasma being mature apoA-I. In contrast, in <b>Tangier</b> disease there is a marked relative increase of proapoA-I as compared with mature apoA-I. ProapoA-I and mature apoA-I were isolated from normal and <b>Tangier</b> disease subjects, radio-labeled, and autologous apoA-I isoproteins injected into normal and <b>Tangier</b> subjects. The in vivo catabolism and conversion of proapoA-I and mature apoA-I in normal and <b>Tangier</b> disease subjects were quantitated. A comparison of the rate of catabolism of apoA-I isoproteins from plasma revealed a significantly faster rate of catabolism of both isoproteins of apoA-I in <b>Tangier</b> subjects when compared with normal subjects. The fractional conversion rate of proapoA-I to mature apoA-I was 3. 9 d- 1 in normal subjects and 3. 6 d- 1 in <b>Tangier</b> subjects. The results indicate that (a) apoA-I enters plasma as the pro isoprotein in both normal and <b>Tangier</b> subjects, (b) <b>Tangier</b> disease subjects have a normal fractional rate of conversion of proapoA-I to mature apoA-I, (c) proapoA-I is catabolized {{at the same rate}} as mature apoA-I in <b>Tangier</b> subjects, and (d) <b>Tangier</b> subjects catabolize both pro and mature apoA-I at a much greater rate than do normal subjects. Therefore, the relative increase in proapoA-I in <b>Tangier</b> disease is due to a marked decrease in mature apoA-I resulting from rapid catabolism of both pro- and mature apoA-I and not to defective conversion of proapoA-I to mature apoA-I...|$|R
25|$|The cuisine of Telangana {{consists}} of the Telugu cuisine, of Telangana's Telugu {{people as well as}} Hyderabadi cuisine (also known as Nizami cuisine), of Telangana's Hyderabadi Muslim community. Hyderabadi food is based heavily on non-vegetarian ingredients while, Telugu food is a mix of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian ingredients. Telugu food is rich in spices and chillies are abundantly used. The food also generally tends to be more on the <b>tangy</b> side with tamarind and lime juice both used liberally as souring agents. Rice is the staple food of Telugu people. Starch is consumed with a variety of curries and lentil soups or broths. Vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods are both popular. Hyderabadi cuisine includes popular delicacies such as Biryani, Haleem, Baghara baingan and Kheema, while Hyderabadi day to day dishes see some commonalities with Telanganite Telugu food, with its use of tamarind, rice, and lentils, along with meat.

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} medieval cookbooks in a language other than Latin was Libre de Sent Soví ("The Book of Saint Sophia"), written in Catalan around 1324. A majority of its recipes call for bitter oranges, rose water and cider to achieve the popular <b>tangy</b> flavor of late medieval cuisine. It contains many fish recipes, but surprisingly enough, no mention of shellfish, which must {{have been one of}} the major food sources in the Catalan coastal regions. The highly influential Libre del Coch, in Catalan as well, was published in a printed edition in 1520, but is assumed to have been written no later than 1490. The typical medieval white dish (manjar blanco) seems to have appeared first in Catalonia in the 8th century and eventually evolved into a type of sweet pudding. While poorly represented in cookbooks, the most common food for the general population, other than the regular staples of bread, wine, garlic, onion and olive oil, included eggs, lamb, beef, kid and bacon.|$|E
25|$|The golden {{trevally}} is commonly targeted by both anglers and spearfishermen, {{and is considered}} to be a gamefish. Golden trevally will take a variety of baits and lures and may be caught from both the shore and boats, making it a highly accessible species. Baits commonly employed for {{golden trevally}} include prawns and a variety of small fish or cut baits. The fish are known to follow a burley stream right up to the back of a boat, allowing for easy capture on unweighted baits. A variety of lures may be employed when targeting the species, including jigs, poppers, spoons, slices, and minnows, with large minnows trolled around reefs often accounting for larger specimens. The use of saltwater fly fishing to specifically target golden trevally has developed in recent years, especially over shallow, sandy flats. In these cases, a sinking line and leader is employed to not spook the fish in these shallow waters. Once hooked, golden trevally are known for fast runs and hard fights, especially when reef or other structures are present. Golden trevally are considered one of the best members of the trevally family for eating, with bleeding recommended. The fish has slightly translucent, dark-pink flesh while fresh, becoming white and juicy during cooking, although has a tendency to become dry, flaky, and fibrous. A rich, <b>tangy</b> fish flavour is noted.|$|E
