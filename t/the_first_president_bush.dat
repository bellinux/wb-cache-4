According to Phillips, [...] "People say you can't tell how a Supreme Court nominee will turn out once on the bench. I respectfully disagree. In most cases, it's very clear. I opposed the nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor because {{it was very clear}} that she had a pro-abortion record in the Arizona State Senate and as a judge in Arizona. She was also allied with Planned Parenthood." [...] In 1990, Phillips opposed <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush's</b> nomination of David Souter of New Hampshire to the high court. Phillips said that he opposed Souter because [...] "I read his senior thesis at Harvard in which he said he was a legal positivist and one of his heroes was Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., and that he rejected all higher law theories, such as those spelled out in our Declaration of Independence. In addition, he was a trustee of two hospitals: Dartmouth Hitchcock and Concord Memorial.

40|$|The diploma thesis "Republican Foreign Policy and the War in Iraq" {{deals with}} the process of U. S. foreign policymaking from the {{perspective}} of the ruling Republican Party between 2003 and 2007. It tracks the development of the intraparty debate on the war in Iraq in reaction to the gradually worsening security situation in the country. It analyzes positions of various schools of thoughts within the American conservative movement and the changing configuration of power in American politics in the studied period. The thesis aims to explain why the Iraq policies of the Bush administration remained virtually intact up until January 2007 despite failing to deliver satisfactory results and what factors shaped this outcome of the conservative debate on Iraq. Three hypotheses are offered to answer the research questions. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> concerns <b>President</b> <b>Bush's</b> management style and the setup of the policymaking process within his administration. The second {{deals with the}} global war on terror narrative constructed in the aftermath of 9 / 11 and its impact on American political discourse. And the third analyzes the use of foreign policy and national security issues as an electoral wedge issue by the Republican Party...|$|R
