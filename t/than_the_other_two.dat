5|$|D. s. harrissoni, {{known as}} the Bornean Rhinoceros or Eastern Sumatran rhinoceros, which was once common {{throughout}} Borneo; now, only about 15 individuals are estimated to survive. The known population lives in East Kalimantan, with them having recently gone extinct in Sabah. Reports of animals surviving in Sarawak are unconfirmed. This subspecies is named after Tom Harrisson, who worked extensively with Bornean zoology and anthropology in the 1960s.

5|$|The third type was the Canadian Pacer, {{which was}} {{historically}} better documented <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> types. Canadian Pacers were likely {{the result of}} breeding pacing horses imported from France with Narragansett Pacers from New England. The resulting horses were known {{for their ability to}} race on ice. From there, they were exported to the United States, where North Carolina became a breeding center, later exporting them to Tennessee in the late 1700s. Pedigrees were not maintained, so early breeding histories are often impossible to trace. The Canadian Pacer influenced the Tennessee Walker, the American Saddlebred and the Standardbred.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Williams was 36 {{years old}} at the time of his {{participation}} in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Born in Mandeville, the capital of Manchester Parish in west-central Jamaica, Williams' participation in Beijing marked his sixth time participating in an Olympic event and the third time he had appeared at an Olympic games (previously representing Jamaica in three events in the 2000 Sydney games and one event in the 2004 Athens games). In Sydney, Williams was part of the men's 4 × 400meters relay, winning the silver medal in the event. In Beijing, Williams participated in the men's 200meters dash, which had a qualification round that took place on August 17. He was placed in the second heat, where he placed third out of its eight athletes with a time of 20.53seconds. Although placing ahead of Japan's Shinji Takahira (20.58seconds), Williams fell behind heat leaders Brian Dzingai of Zimbabwe (20.25seconds) and Great Britain's Christian Malcolm (20.42seconds). Overall, of the 62 athletes completing the event, Williams placed fifth. That was higher <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> Jamaicans competing in the event (Usain Bolt placed 17th and Marvin Anderson placed 27th). He advanced to the quarterfinals.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus {{lived in}} a vast {{floodplain}} along the western shore of the interior seaway. Large rivers watered the land, occasionally flooding and blanketing the region with new sediment. When water was plentiful, the region could support {{a great deal of}} plant and animal life, but periodic droughts also struck the region, resulting in mass mortality as preserved in the many bonebed deposits found in Two Medicine and Judith River sediments, including the Daspletosaurus bonebed. Similar conditions exist today in East Africa. Volcanic eruptions from the west periodically blanketed the region with ash, also resulting in large-scale mortality, while simultaneously enriching the soil for future plant growth. It is these ash beds that allow precise radiometric dating as well. Fluctuating sea levels also resulted in a variety of other environments at different times and places within the Judith River Group, including offshore and nearshore marine habitats, coastal wetlands, deltas and lagoons, in addition to the inland floodplains. The Two Medicine Formation was deposited at higher elevations farther inland <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> formations.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{its large}} size, the overall {{appearance}} of Deinosuchus was not considerably {{different from that}} of modern crocodilians. Deinosuchus had an alligator-like, broad snout, with a slightly bulbous tip. Each premaxilla contained four teeth, with the pair nearest to the tip of the snout being significantly smaller <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two.</b> Each maxilla (the main tooth-bearing bone in the upper jaw) contained 21 or 22teeth. The tooth count for each dentary (tooth-bearing bone in the lower jaw) was at least 22. All the teeth were very thick and robust; those close {{to the rear of the}} jaws were short, rounded, and blunt. They appear to have been adapted for crushing, rather than piercing. When the mouth was closed, only the fourth tooth of the lower jaw would have been visible.|$|E
5|$|In-game, Terrans tend {{to favor}} {{traditional}} modes of warfare, often utilizing combined arms tactics with tanks, aircraft or other combat vehicles in combination with regular infantry. Using light ballistics, large calibre weapons and even tactical nuclear warheads, many Terran units are reminiscent of present-day designs. Terrans are the only race without a melee combat unit. Terrans are more adaptive <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> races {{and are able to}} produce units at an average expense. Primary base structures can even lift off and fly to other locations, allowing players to move buildings for quicker troop deployments, access to new resource locations or to save the structures from destruction by the enemy. Terran buildings and mechanized units can be repaired if damaged, and combat medics can heal wounded organic units.|$|E
5|$|Nansouty's {{division}} {{suffered a}} very high casualty rate at the Battle of Wagram, with more men and horses lost <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> heavy cavalry divisions combined. Losses in horses were extremely high, with 1,141 animals killed or injured, while losses in men were also significant, {{despite the fact that}} only the carabiniers-à-cheval really came into contact with the enemy. Overall, Nansouty's division lost 164 men killed and 436 wounded. Foremost of all, the highly battered two carabiniers-à-cheval regiments had no more than 300 horses standing between themselves {{by the end of the}} day, for an equine casualty rate of 77 percent, with the 9th and 12th cuirassiers also suffering high casualties. Bessières's charge, hastily organised with only the division of Nansouty, through murderous artillery fire and against masses of infantry prepared to receive them, had less tactical effect than at Aspern-Essling, but it did win Napoleon valuable time, allowing him to retake the initiative in this battle.|$|E

5|$|The 19 dorsal {{vertebrae}} {{are similar}} to the pectoral vertebrae, being weakly concave and taller than long, but the neural spines are proportionally taller than the centra. The single-headed dorsal ribs are rounded but slightly flattened in cross-section, and some have a prong-like projection at the top end; their articular surfaces are slightly concave. Underneath, there are at least ten pairs of gastralia, each of which tapers to the sides and has a central groove on the bottom surface. The three sacral vertebrae are similar, but have much smaller, blunter, more oval-shaped ribs. The comparatively smaller first sacral rib is directed further outwards and backwards <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> ribs. There initially were 25 caudal vertebrae preserved, with 22 still being accounted for. The last several caudal vertebrae are partially fused into a pygostyle-like structure. The preserved caudal ribs are flattened, triangular, and taper towards the tip of the tail.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{association}} between polymorphisms of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and muscle-specific creatine kinase (CKMM) genes, and the actual performance status observed in professional cyclists capable of completing a classic tour stage race such as the Giro d'Italia, Tour de France, or Vuelta a Espana. To accomplish this, we compared the frequencies of the ACE and CKMM genotypes/alleles in 50 top-level Spanish professional cyclists that have completed {{at least one of}} these events to 119 sedentary controls, and 27 elite (Olympic-class) Spanish runners. The genetic polymorphism at the CK-MM locus was detected with the NcoI restriction endonuclease. The results of our study showed that the proportion of the DD genotype was higher in cyclists (50. 0 %) <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> groups (p < 0. 05), the proportion of the ID genotype was higher in controls (46. 2 %) <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> groups (p < 0. 05), and the proportion of the II genotype was higher in runners (40. 7 %) <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> groups (p < 0. 05). The proportion of the D allele was higher in both cyclists (65. 0 %) and controls (57. 6 %) than in runners (46. 3 %) (p < 0. 001), whereas the proportion of the I allele was higher in runners <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> groups (p < 0. 001). No statistical differences were found for CKK-MM- NcoI. We conclude that in top-level professional cyclists capable of completing a classic 3 -wk tour race, the frequency distribution of the D allele and the DD genotype seems to be higher than in other endurance athletes such as elite runners (in whom the I allele is especially frequent) ...|$|R

5|$|The {{other main}} sources of {{information}} are maps, particularly those published {{at the time the}} canal was to be converted into a railway. These clearly show twin-track inclines at Capel Ifan and Pont Henry, and because most of the traffic was in the downhill direction, a simple counterbalanced system was probably employed, although it has also been suggested that the barge may have been balanced by a water tank on the second track to more easily control the speed of descent. The Hirwaunissa incline was longer and narrower <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two,</b> and only included a single track.

5|$|Tyrannosauroids had S-shaped {{necks and}} long tails, as did most other theropods. Early genera had long forelimbs, about 60% {{the length of}} the hindlimb in Guanlong, with the typical three digits of coelurosaurs. The long forelimb persisted at least through the Early Cretaceous Eotyrannus, but is unknown in Appalachiosaurus. Derived tyrannosaurids have forelimbs {{strongly}} reduced in size, the most extreme example being Tarbosaurus from Mongolia, where the humerus was only one-quarter {{the length of the}} femur. The third digit of the forelimb was also reduced over time. This digit was unreduced in the basal Guanlong, while in Dilong it was more slender <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> digits. Eotyrannus also had three functional digits on each hand. Tyrannosaurids had only two, although the vestigial metacarpal of the third are preserved in some well-preserved specimens.
