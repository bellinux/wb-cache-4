5|$|This step is {{necessary}} because the rational nexus test is not foolproof. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> {{based on the}} presumption that the legislative object itself is not {{in violation of the}} Constitution. However, if the object of the statute is itself illegitimate, a classification may be invalid even if it satisfies the test. Hence, <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> only applicable if the object of the impugned legislation is a proper one.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid {{is used as}} part of {{cervical}} cancer screening in many areas in the developing world. Acetic acid {{is applied to the}} cervix and if an area of white appears after about a minute <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> positive.|$|E

50|$|For example, a {{possible}} outcome of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> would <b>be</b> negative-positive {{meaning that the}} initial phase of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> negative indicating competence in the deep and communicating veins and {{the second phase of}} <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> positive meaning that there is superficial vein incompetence.|$|R
5|$|Along {{with the}} course curriculum, the exam is {{developed}} by the AP Statistics Test Development Committee as well. With the help of other college professors, the committee creates a large pool of possible questions that is pre-tested with college students taking statistics courses. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> then refined to an appropriate level of difficulty and clarity. Afterwards, the Educational Testing Service is responsible for printing and administering the exam.|$|E
5|$|Next, the {{examining}} physician may check for {{weakness of the}} quadriceps. This examination may reveal fluid in the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The Wilson test is also useful in locating OCD lesions of the femoral condyle. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> performed by slowly extending the knee from 90 degrees, maintaining internal rotation. Pain at 30 degrees of flexion and relief with tibial external rotation is indicative of OCD.|$|E
5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in private nuisance, the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, the defendant is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> whether or not the nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the defendant is expected to avoid it.|$|E
30|$|The brine/oil {{ratio was}} 90 / 10 in these <b>tests.</b> <b>The</b> {{hydrocarbon}} used in <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> <b>was</b> an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent (Isopar M). <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> run for 18  h.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} nonparametric specification {{tests for}} stochastic volatility models {{by comparing the}} nonparametically estimated return density and distribution functions with their parametric counterparts.

Extensive Monte Carlo experiments are performed to study the finite sample properties of <b>the</b> <b>tests.</b> <b>The</b> proposed <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> applied {{in a number of}} empirical examples...|$|R
5|$|Growth hormone {{deficiency}} {{is almost}} certain if all other pituitary tests are also abnormal, and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1) levels are decreased. If this is not the case, IGF-1 levels are poorly predictive of the presence of GH deficiency; stimulation testing with the insulin tolerance test is then required. This is performed by administering insulin to lower the blood sugar to a level below 2.2mmol/l. Once this occurs, growth hormone levels are measured. If they are low despite the stimulatory effect of the low blood sugars, growth hormone deficiency is confirmed. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> not without risks, especially in those prone to seizures or are known to have heart disease, and causes the unpleasant symptoms of hypoglycemia. Alternative tests (such as the growth hormone releasing hormone stimulation test) are less useful, although a stimulation test with arginine may be used for diagnosis, especially in situations where an insulin tolerance test is thought to be too dangerous. If GH deficiency is suspected, and all other pituitary hormones are normal, two different stimulation tests are needed for confirmation.|$|E
5|$|In this stage, it is {{necessary}} to inquire into, firstly, the object of the statute, and secondly, whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> whether it is reasonable, taking into consideration the object of the statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, it {{is necessary}} to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of the statute. The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> {{to ensure that}} the right to equal {{protection}} is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness. First, individuals in the same class must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily. Secondly, the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary. Lastly, the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action. The stages of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness. As such, a law that satisfies all the stages of the test will be found to be valid and constitutional.|$|E
30|$|Thereby, if <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> significant, {{there was}} a linear {{dependence}} between the dependent variable and the independent ones selected. Therefore, all independent variables, for which <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> not significant, <b>were</b> removed. <b>The</b> Fisher <b>test</b> <b>was</b> then applied which allows to check {{if the number of}} independent variables is sufficient to describe the dependent variable.|$|R
50|$|ELAT was {{developed}} by Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing {{in partnership with the}} University of Oxford. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> developed to help admissions tutors differentiate within a large pool of extremely well-qualified applicants and provide information about applicants’ skills in close reading of literary texts. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> trialled by Oxford in 2006 and became part of their admissions process in 2007.
