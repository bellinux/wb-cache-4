5|$|The total herd size is {{relatively}} small. The population numbers stabilized somewhat {{at the beginning}} of the 21st century, with around 1500 broodmares, 150 active stallions and 500 births per year. In 2006, 455 new foals were registered, 1,051 mares and 89 stallions were listed as active breeding stock and there were 306 breeders, a term applied <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> at least one active broodmare. In the same year, the Mérens made up 2 percent of total horses in France. A genetic study in 2008 considers the original type of the breed to be endangered. The author suggested that the Mérens should be a conservation priority in order to maintain the maximum genetic diversity among French horse breeds.|$|E

25|$|In prehistoric times, chert {{was often}} used as a raw {{material}} {{for the construction of}} stone tools. Like obsidian, as well as some rhyolites, felsites, quartzites, and other tool stones used in lithic reduction, chert fractures in a Hertzian cone when struck with sufficient force. This results in conchoidal fractures, a characteristic of all minerals with no cleavage planes. In this kind of fracture, a cone of force propagates through the material from the point of impact, eventually removing a full or partial cone; this result is familiar <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> seen what happens to a plate-glass window when struck by a small object, such as an air gun projectile. The partial Hertzian cones produced during lithic reduction are called flakes, and exhibit features characteristic of this sort of breakage, including striking platforms, bulbs of force, and occasionally eraillures, which are small secondary flakes detached from the flake's bulb of force.|$|E

They also praised the story and said, [...] "One {{of the differences between the}} original Four Swords and Adventures is a more persistent narrative." [...] The game was also applauded, with a critic quoted as remarking, [...] "Adventures does improve on the original Four Swords' visuals, making the Wind-Waker-derived visual style even more reminiscent of the cel-shaded adventure of Link."

500|$|Many reviewers {{noted the}} {{similarities}} between the Iraqi boys and those from Western cultures. Peter Scarlet, the artistic director at the Tribeca Film Festival, said, [...] "What's fascinating about the film that resulted is how very familiar and ordinary these kids are – they're not really all that different from your own teenagers or the kids you went to school with. The kids of Baghdad High also open us up to a very different sense of life in Iraq than what we've been seeing on the nightly news for five years." [...] The Huffington Post said, [...] "previously it had been unfathomable that students in Baghdad might be experiencing the same ephemeral and narcissistic heartbreak as we are in the United States." [...] Farhi and Nicholls noticed that the Iraqi students do the same things as American high school students, such as listening to rap music, trying to study without distractions, playing sports, becoming stressed over their final exams and acting silly with their friends. Perigard commented, [...] "despite the cultural differences, Ali, Anmar, Hayder and Mohammad will seem instantly familiar <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> spent time around a teenage boy.

[...] He did admit that writer Straczynski [...] "had a great handle on the Peter/Mary Jane dynamic," [...] making their potentially final moments mean something, and that Quesada's artistic style made sense given the dark tone. However, he also dismissed the story as [...] "infuriating and downright disrespectful <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> come to love Spider-Man comics over the years." [...] IGN published two [...] "Additional Take" [...] reviews for Amazing Spider-Man #545. Bryan Joel said that he'd been a [...] "vocal supporter" [...] of [...] "Brand New Day", but summarized the OMD story as [...] "flip, weightless, and painfully brief." [...] Richard George stated that [...] "One More Day" [...] "could {{prove to be the}} best example of editorial influence gone horribly, horribly wrong" [...] and [...] "in trying to preserve the appeal of Peter Parker, Joe Quesada has actually managed to fundamentally undermine the character." [...] Both Joel and George agreed with their colleague in complimenting Quesada's artwork. Tim Marchman of The Wall Street Journal stated that having Spider-Man make a deal with the devil-like Mephisto is [...] "the rough equivalent of having Z-movie director Uwe Boll film a studio-funded prequel to Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver." ...|$|E
