5|$|On August 7, 2010, the Infrared Array Camera {{aboard the}} Spitzer Space Telescope {{was used to}} find the centroid, the point in space around which both of the Kepler-14 stars orbit.

5|$|The booked service allowed {{two options}} of fees. <b>The</b> <b>Transit</b> Booking System, {{available}} online, allowing customers {{who do not}} want to wait in queue to pay an additional 15% over the regular tolls, guaranteeing a specific day for transit and crossing the canal in 18 hours or less. ACP sells 24 of these daily slots up to 365 days in advance. The second choice was high priority transit. Since 2006, ACP has available a 25th slot, sold through <b>the</b> <b>Transit</b> Slot Auction to the highest bidder. The main customers of <b>the</b> <b>Transit</b> Booking System are cruise ships, containerships, vehicle carriers, and non-containerized cargo vessels.|$|E

40|$|The outer {{architectures}} of Kepler's compact {{systems of}} multiple transiting planets remain poorly constrained and {{few of these}} systems have lower bounds on the orbital distance of any massive outer planets. We infer a minimum orbital distance and upper limits on the inclination of a hypothetical Jovian-mass planet orbiting exterior to <b>the</b> six <b>transiting</b> planets at Kepler- 11. Our constraints are derived from dynamical models together with observations provided by the Kepler mission. Firstly, <b>the</b> lack of <b>transit</b> timing variations (TTV) in <b>the</b> outermost <b>transiting</b> planet Kepler- 11 g imply that the system does not contain a Jovian mass perturber within 2 AU from the star. Secondly, we test under what initial conditions a Jovian-mass planet moderately inclined from <b>the</b> <b>transiting</b> planets would make their co-transiting configuration unlikely. <b>The</b> <b>transiting</b> planets are secularly coupled and exhibit small mutual inclinations over long time-scales, although <b>the</b> outermost <b>transiting</b> planet, Kepler- 11 g is weakly coupled to the inner five. We rule out a Jovian-mass planet on a 3 degree inclination within 3. 0 AU, and higher inclinations out to further orbital distances, unless an undetected planet exists orbiting in the dynamical gap between Kepler- 11 f and Kepler- 11 g. Our constraints depend little on whether we assume <b>the</b> six <b>transiting</b> planets of Kepler- 11 were initially perfectly co-planar or whether a minimum initial mutual inclination between <b>the</b> <b>transiting</b> planets is adopted {{based on the measured}} impact parameters of <b>the</b> <b>transiting</b> planets.

5|$|Although Kepler's {{calculations}} {{indicated that}} the 1631 transit of Venus would best be visible from the American continent, he was not fully confident of his prediction, and advised that European astronomers {{should be prepared to}} observe the event. Gassendi and others in Europe watched for it but, as predicted, the Sun was below the horizon during <b>the</b> <b>transit.</b> According to modern calculations, observers in much of Italy and along the eastern Mediterranean {{should have been able to}} view the last stage of <b>the</b> <b>transit,</b> but no such observations were recorded. Kepler had predicted a near miss for a Venus transit in 1639 and, as the next full transit was not expected for another 121years, Gassendi and the other astronomers concentrated their efforts in other areas.|$|E

5|$|Bernard Lovell built <b>the</b> <b>Transit</b> Telescope at Jodrell Bank in {{the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could only point directly upwards; {{the next logical step}} was to build a telescope that could look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although <b>the</b> <b>Transit</b> Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E
