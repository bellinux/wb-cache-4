5|$|Complementing his {{interest}} in the foundations of general relativity and, more generally, of physics, Ehlers researched <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> physics.

Throughout his career, Ehlers had an interest in the philosophical foundations and implications of physics and contributed to research on this topic by addressing questions such as the basic status of scientific knowledge in physics.|$|E
