5|$|Some modern genealogical {{researchers}} consider John {{a possible}} father to Theodora Axouchina, wife of Emperor Alexios I Megas Komnenos of Trebizond (r. 1204–1222), {{but that is}} conjectural: the family name Axouchina is ascribed <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>because</b> her eldest son, the Trebizondian emperor John I Megas Komnenos Axouchos (r. 1235–1238), bore it as well.|$|E
5|$|While in Germany, Victoria {{showed an}} {{interest}} in the Nazi Party, which appealed <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>because</b> of its anti-Bolshevik stance and her hope that the movement might help restore the Russian monarchy. She and Kirill attended a Nazi rally in Coburg in 1922 and Victoria donated money to the party. She was likely unaware of the most sinister aspects of the Nazi Party.|$|E

5|$|That {{shot was}} totally and {{completely}} inspired by 'Something's Got to Give,' Marilyn Monroe's last movie that never got finished. It's an homage <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>because</b> I've {{never seen anyone}} re-create it. So many people have emulated so many of Marilyn's classic moments, but it's just that I'm {{a big fan of}} hers, and I thought it was really pretty at night with the pool. No one could ever be as fabulous as Marilyn was, but it's in honor and homage to her.|$|E
5|$|Upon recommissioning in mid-1914, she {{was briefly}} {{assigned}} to the 6th Cruiser Squadron in August before being {{assigned to the}} 4th Cruiser Squadron to reinforce Cradock's forces. He transferred his flag <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>because</b> she was faster than his previous flagship. Cradock's command {{was transferred to the}} coast of South America later that month at his own suggestion to better hunt for the German ships preying upon British merchant ships.

5|$|The {{taxi driver}} and his {{companion}} hold Homer hostage {{deep into the}} rainforest. They force Homer {{to make a phone}} call to Marge, telling her that if the family provides 50,000 dollars to the kidnappers, he will be released. However, the Simpsons do not have enough money so they go looking for Homer instead. Walking through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, they run into a parade that features a Teleboobies float with characters from the show. Lisa is surprised to discover that Ronaldo is working inside the costume of the dancing flamingo from Teleboobies—a well-paid job he got after learning to dance with the shoes he bought with Lisa's donation money. Ronaldo tells Lisa that he stopped writing <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>because</b> he did not know which state she lives in, since it was the orphanage that used to send his letters. Later, Ronaldo gives the Simpsons the money they need to save Homer. Meanwhile, Homer shows the kidnappers a scrapbook he made of his kidnapping memories. Apparently, he has developed Stockholm syndrome. The family and the kidnappers then meet up high over a valley near the Sugarloaf Mountain in two separate cable cars. The Simpsons toss the kidnappers their money, and when Homer jumps into his family's cable car, the cables break, sending the family crashing into the mountainside and rolling down to the ground. They all survive unharmed, but Bart is then eaten whole by an anaconda. The episode ends with Bart dancing inside the snake to carnival music.|$|E

As it happened, the field she went to belonged to a man named Boaz, who was kind <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>because</b> he had heard of her loyalty to her mother-in-law. Ruth told Naomi of Boaz's kindness, and she gleaned in his field through the remainder of barley and wheat harvest.|$|E

25|$|Bouvier and U.S. Representative John F. Kennedy {{belonged to}} the same social circle and were {{formally}} introduced by a mutual friend, journalist Charles L. Bartlett, {{at a dinner party}} in May 1952. Bouvier was attracted to Kennedy's physical appearance, charm, wit and wealth. The couple also shared the similarities of Catholicism, writing, enjoying reading and having previously lived abroad. Kennedy was busy running for the U.S. Senate, and the relationship grew more serious after the November election, when he proposed <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Because</b> Bouvier had been assigned to cover the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in London for The Washington Times-Herald, she took some time to accept. After a month in Europe, she returned to the United States and accepted Kennedy's marriage proposal. She then resigned from her position at the newspaper. Their engagement was officially announced on June 25, 1953.|$|E
500|$|Graham was {{announced}} as {{cast in the}} role in October 2015. He compared his relationship to Frost to that of Bill and Hillary Clinton, calling them [...] "a power couple" [...] and adding, [...] "I think that Chadwick was probably attracted <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>because</b> of her beauty, [...] also a very smart woman, very successful, also probably a Type A. We really strive, both of us I think, as a very successful actress and with a very successful business. The world is our oyster. We’re going to make as many pearls as we can." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Cuando" [...] (When), {{also in a}} minor key, is a pop R ballad {{featuring}} synthesizers and percussion with Caribbean {{roots and}} Afro-Latin influences.

In the song, Queen explores {{what happens when a}} relationship ends: [...] "Adam sinned because he loved Eve, the love of Celia and Pedro touched the stars, but only when you learn to value women, can you be happy". An editor for iTunes claimed the song's lyrics to be sultry. She stated that of the 16 tracks, [...] "Cuando" [...] means the most <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>because</b> it is an Rbolero track which would remind men to value women.|$|E

500|$|Francis tried {{a variety}} of methods to raise money, but {{concentrated}} on a lawsuit against Charles III, Duke of Bourbon. [...] The Duke of Bourbon had received the majority of his holdings through his marriage to Suzanne, Duchess of Bourbon, who had died shortly {{before the start of the}} war. Louise of Savoy, Suzanne's sister and the king's mother, insisted that the territories in question should pass <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>because</b> of her closer kinship to the deceased. [...] Francis was confident that seizing the disputed lands would improve his own financial position sufficiently to continue the war and began to confiscate portions of them in Louise's name. Bourbon, angered by this treatment and increasingly isolated at court, began to make overtures to Charles V to betray the French king.|$|E
500|$|According to Lo, [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] is {{the song}} from Truth Serum (2014) {{that means the}} most <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>because</b> of its honest lyrics and {{extended}} writing process. Initially, the verses of the song {{were part of a}} poem written by Lo when she was going through a difficult time in a relationship. Later, Lo's boyfriend became part of a Buddhist movement but she refused to join, which led the relationship to an end. After that, she started using drugs and drinking in order to forget him. Months after the relationship ended, she was staying at a friend's apartment in New York City, during 2012's Hurricane Sandy. When the apartment lost electricity and heat, Lo went on to stay at her friend's studio in Midtown, New York City, where she wrote the chorus.|$|E
500|$|An {{interest}} in portraying [...] "actual human drama" [...] has led Moore to these roles. She is particularly {{moved by the}} concept of an individual repressing their troubles and striving to maintain dignity. Parts where the character achieves an amazing feat are of little interest <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>because</b> [...] "we're just not very often in that position in our lives." [...] Early in her career, Moore established a reputation for pushing boundaries, and she continues to be praised for her [...] "fearless" [...] performances and for taking on difficult roles. When asked if there are any roles she has avoided, she replied, [...] "Nothing within the realm of human behaviour." [...] She is known for her willingness to perform nude and appear in sex scenes, although she has said she will only do so if she feels it fits the role.|$|E
50|$|Poison kills {{three of}} the High Evolutionary's Purifiers, who were sent <b>to</b> kill <b>her</b> <b>because</b> there was a {{possibility}} that her powers could be passed on <b>to</b> <b>her</b> offspring. She then journeys to the Nexus of All Realities, where Ylandris splits herself off from Cecilia and uses the Nexus <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>her</b> home dimension. <b>Because</b> Ylandris had modified her genetic structure, Poison retains her superhuman powers even after her departure. Before departing, Ylandris informs <b>her</b> that <b>because</b> she was still pregnant {{at the time of their}} merging, Carlos might retain some form of her power as well.|$|R

500|$|Garbage drummer and co-producer Butch Vig {{said that}} when the group contributed to film soundtracks, [...] "one of our fantasies would be to do the Bond theme or do the new Bond song." [...] Manson called herself {{a fan of the}} series, [...] "an {{institution}} I admire and has always captured my imagination since I was a child", and the films had a [...] "sensibility quite similar to how we approach making music". The chance to record a Bond theme appealed <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>because</b> [...] "you know it's going down in movie history", and coming from Scotland, like original Bond Sean Connery, [...] "that's very close and inherent in our culture. It's not Bond if it's not Scottish!" [...] The singer considered Garbage's music and the series' concepts [...] "something that you can enjoy on the surface, but underneath there are lots of conflicting themes you can get into." ...|$|E
500|$|The filming {{took place}} in June 2017 at The Confidante, a hotel located in Miami Beach {{that is part of}} the Unbound Collection brand by Hyatt. Hyatt's vice {{president}} of global brands, Sandra Micek, stated that the collaboration between the artist and the hotel made sense <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>because</b> [...] " [...] inspiration and its name came from the notion of being a trusted friend". Regarding the shooting, Scholfield commented that the camera was quite near during the dance routines, in order to film more uninterrupted single takes. During an interview with NPR, Lipa commented that, [...] "What I wanted to convey in this video is the unity and togetherness of women supporting each other, helping each other and looking after each other in a situation." [...] The visual premiered through Lipa's YouTube account on 7 July 2017. After this, Hyatt released two behind-the-scenes clips of the shooting.|$|E
500|$|Of all the {{treatments}} {{of the story}} of Troilus and, especially, Cressida in the period between Chaucer and Shakespeare, it is Robert Henryson's that receives the most attention from modern critics. His poem The Testament of Cresseid is described by the Middle English expert C. David Benson as the [...] "only fifteenth century poem written in Great Britain that begins to rival the moral and artistic complexity of Chaucer's Troilus". [...] In the Testament the title-character is abandoned by Diomedes and then afflicted with leprosy so that she becomes unrecognizable to Troilus. He pities the lepers she is with and is generous <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>because</b> she reminds him of the idol of her in his mind, but he remains the virtuous pagan knight and does not achieve the redemption that she does. Even so, following Henryson Troilus was seen as a representation of generosity.|$|E
