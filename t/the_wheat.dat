5|$|Alongside his {{stand-alone}} illustrations, in July 1926 Hergé began {{production of}} a comic strip for Le Boy-Scout Belge, Les Aventures de Totor (The Adventures of Totor), which continued intermittent publication until 1929. Revolving around the adventures of a Boy Scout patrol leader, the comic initially featured written captions underneath the scenes, but Hergé began to experiment with other forms of conveying information, including speech bubbles. Illustrations were also published in Le Blé qui lève (<b>The</b> <b>Wheat</b> That Grows) and other publications of the Catholic Association of Belgian Young People, and Hergé produced a book jacket for Weverbergh's novel, The Soul of the Sea. Being young and inexperienced, still learning his craft, Hergé sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived Atelier de la Fleur de Lys (AFL), an organisation for Christian cartoonists.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, Minneapolis began to lose its {{dominant}} position in the flour milling industry, after reaching its peak in 1915–1916. The rise of steam power, and later electric power, eroded the advantage that St. Anthony Falls provided in water power. <b>The</b> <b>wheat</b> fields of the Dakotas and Minnesota's Red River Valley began suffering from soil exhaustion due to consecutive wheat crops, leading {{to an increase in}} wheat leaf rust and related crop diseases. The farmers of the southern plains developed a variety of hardy red winter wheat suitable for bread flour, and the Kansas City area gained prominence in milling. Also, due to changes in rail shipping rates, millers in Buffalo, New York were able to ship their flour more competitively.|$|E
40|$|In December 2011, the Prime Minister, Stephen Harper and the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Gerry Ritz {{announced}} {{the dissolution of}} <b>the</b> Canadian <b>Wheat</b> Board. This essay analyses {{the rise and fall}} of <b>the</b> Canadian <b>Wheat</b> Board through <b>the</b> lens of historical institutionalism. We establish a comparison across time between the economical, social and political contexts that influenced the birth and the death of the institution. In the first section of this essay, we define the economical, social and political factors that we will use as a guideline to compare the contexts of the creation and dismantlement of <b>the</b> Canadian <b>Wheat</b> Board. This section is based on the work of Swinnen (2009) on the emergence of the protection of agriculture in the 20 th century. The second section of this essay gives an overview of <b>the</b> Canadian <b>Wheat</b> Board with detailing on its history, its role and guiding principles, and the place it takes in the Canadian and international markets. This section aims to prove that <b>the</b> Canadian <b>Wheat</b> Board was, in fact, created in order to provide protection to the farmers and that Swinnen’s analysis is relevant to the Canadian experience. In the third section of this essay, we use the five factors identified by Swinnen (demonstrated in section one) to compare the Canadian contexts during the rise and the fall of <b>the</b> Canadian <b>Wheat</b> Board. We show that all the factors provided by Swinnen are relevant to the emergence of <b>the</b> Canadian <b>Wheat</b> Board, but none of them apply to the current situation. In the fourth section, we show that there are other factors that are not identified by Swinnen that have influenced the dismantlement of <b>the</b> Canadian <b>Wheat</b> Board, such as international regulation and regional agreements. Finally, this essay concludes that <b>the</b> Canadian <b>Wheat</b> Board has become outdated and that its demise was inevitable given the current context...|$|R

It is ball-shaped and {{typically}} half the size of the Syrian hamster, so is called a dwarf hamster along with all Phodopus species. Features of the Djungarian hamster include a typically thick, dark grey dorsal stripe and furry feet. As winter approaches and the days shorten, the Djungarian hamster's dark fur is almost entirely replaced with white fur. In captivity, this does not always happen.

One son added that Davis had said Waller had continued to shoot after Davis had already fallen to the ground. The testimony of other witnesses, including Waller's relatives, was inconclusive, as they were too distant to hear the conversation between Waller and Davis.

5|$|Theophrastus groups {{together}} the cereals and the legumes (peas and beans), and includes millet and other many-seeded plants like sesame also. These {{can only be}} grown from seed.

When sprouting, beans form a shape like a penis, from which the root grows down and the leafy stem upwards. Wheat and barley flower {{for four or five}} days, whereas the legumes flower for much longer. Theophrastus reports that these plants grow differently according to the region, so for instance crops in Salamis appear earlier than those elsewhere in Attica. Wheat varieties are recorded as being named for their localities; they differ in colour, size, growth habit and food value.
