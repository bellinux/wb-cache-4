5|$|In Ex parte Bollman (1807), the Court {{held that}} {{conspiracy}} {{to wage war}} on the United States was not treason. Further, Bollman held that <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> both Bollman and Swartwout was insufficient to justify pre-trial detention.|$|E
5|$|Mary's brother, William Ashford, {{launched}} an appeal, and Thornton was rearrested. Thornton claimed {{the right to}} trial by battle, a medieval usage {{that had never been}} repealed by Parliament.

5|$|Portland, Oregon police {{officers}} searched {{the home of}} James Butler Elkins, ostensibly for obscene material, and seized tape recordings that Elkins had made from illegal wiretaps. He was subsequently convicted in federal court of intercepting and divulging telephone communications, but appealed his federal conviction {{on the grounds that}} state police had gathered <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> him in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. His conviction was upheld by the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|The court {{decided that}} <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> Thornton was not overwhelming, and that trial by battle was a {{permissible}} option under law; thus Thornton was granted trial by battle. Ashford declined {{the offer of}} battle and Thornton was freed from custody. Appeals such as Ashford's were abolished by statute in 1819, and with {{them the right to}} trial by battle. Thornton emigrated to the United States, where he died around 1860.|$|E
5|$|This event {{led to a}} {{court case}} which {{marked the first time}} in Puerto Rico that a court hearing was {{scheduled}} for a case involving sports. He subsequently transferred to Ponce High School, where the Instruction Department tried to have him removed of the athleticism team based on allegations that he had received payment as a student athlete. Judge Roberto Tood Jr. determined that <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> Coimbre was insufficient during the hearing and the case was dropped.|$|E

5|$|Bond is {{eventually}} captured by Gorner in the heroin plant, who explains that Bond {{is to be}} used as bait during a drugs delivery across the Afghan desert, and should he survive an expected ambush, is to fly the captured airliner into the Russian heartland. Bond would be identified as British upon its destruction, increasing <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> the British Government. Bond survives the predicted Afghan attack and plots an escape attempt, which sees Scarlett get away due to Bond surrendering himself as a diversion. In the morning he is taken aboard the aeroplane. Before the airliner can bomb the Soviets, with the aid of the airliner's pilot and Scarlett (who had been hiding on board), Bond regains control of the aeroplane and crashes it into a mountainside after parachuting to safety.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the breakout {{before the last}} stand—which various writers have posited might have actually been desertion—and a box of gold sovereigns, which a Matabele inDuna (leader) later claimed {{had been given to}} two unidentified men from Forbes's rear guard on 2 December, along with a message that Lobengula admitted defeat and wanted the column to stop pursuing him. Two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting the gold, keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message, but <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> them was inconclusive and largely circumstantial; the convictions were ultimately overturned.|$|E
5|$|Extensive but {{superficial}} {{damage was}} caused by an IRA bomb that exploded close to a snack bar at approximately 1:10pm on 10 September 1973, injuring eight people. A similar explosive had detonated 50 minutes earlier at King's Cross. The Metropolitan Police had received a three-minute warning and were unable to evacuate the station completely, but British Transport Police evacuated much of the area just before the explosion. In 1974, the mentally ill Judith Ward confessed to the bombing and was convicted of this and other crimes despite <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> her being highly suspect and Ward retracting her confessions. She was acquitted in 1992, and the culprit has not been found.|$|E

5|$|Gerard Libaridyan, an {{historian}} and close adviser of Ter-Petrosyan, collected and presented <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> the defendants. He later stated {{in an interview}} that he was unsure if the evidence was true, inviting the notion that the party was banned because of its increasing chances of winning seats in the July 1995 parliamentary elections. Several months after the elections, most of the men were found not guilty with the exception of several defendants charged for engaging in corrupt business practices. The ban on the party was lifted, however, less than a week after Ter-Petrosyan fell from power in February 1998 and was replaced by Robert Kocharyan, who was backed by the Dashnaks.|$|E
5|$|In November 1888, he {{lost his}} post at the school for reasons that remain unclear. One month later his body was {{discovered}} drowned in the River Thames. His death, which {{was found to be}} a suicide, roughly coincided {{with the end of the}} murders attributed to Jack the Ripper. Private suggestions in the 1890s that he could have committed the crimes became public knowledge in the 1960s, and led to the publication of books that proposed him as the murderer. <b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> him was entirely circumstantial, however, and many writers from the 1970s onwards have rejected him as a likely suspect.|$|E
5|$|Keith ends his {{relationship}} with Wallace's mother Alicia Fennel (Erica Gimpel) to give Lianne a second chance. Because Celeste refused to pay the $50,000 reward for finding Duncan, Keith sues the Kanes, who agree to pay if Veronica signs away any future claim to their estate. Once Veronica signs, Keith shows her the DNA test that proves he is her father, meaning Veronica never had a claim of the estate. Logan is arrested, and once released he angrily breaks up with Veronica for providing <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> him. Logan then explains that when he saw Lilly after returning from Mexico, he knew their relationship was over and wrote a letter which he left in her car.|$|E

5|$|Morrow {{opened his}} {{practice}} in Lexington. He established his reputation {{in one of}} his first casesthe trial of William Moseby, a black man accused of murder. Moseby's first trial had ended in a hung jury, but because <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> him included a confession (which he later recanted), most observers believed he would be convicted in his second trial. Unable to find a defense lawyer for Moseby, the judge in the case turned to Morrow, who as a young lawyer was eager for work. Morrow proved that his client's testimony had been extorted; he had been told that a lynch mob waited outside the jail for him, but no such mob had ever existed. Morrow further showed that other testimony against his client was false. Moseby was acquitted September 21, 1902.|$|E
5|$|The defense {{maintained}} that <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> Desha was largely circumstantial. They said that Desha's personal items {{could easily have}} been planted where they were found. They pointed out that, despite the stab wounds on Baker's body, no blood was found on the ground near the road or on the path along which the murderer had dragged the body to conceal it. Finally, they contended that, although the days had been unusually warm and wild boars were known to inhabit the area, Baker's body showed no obvious signs of decomposition or disturbance by animals, as might have been expected had it been there for six days, as the prosecution had charged.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{great deal}} of {{controversy}} surrounding the case. Gordon received much support from his family and friends and maintained his innocence. There was a large amount of local interest in the trial as shown by the sales of the local paper, the North-West Evening Mail. Some claimed that much of <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> him could be discounted and there were vigils and petitions in attempts to free Gordon from prison and clear his name. The case featured prominently in the book No Smoke: The Shocking Truth About British Justice which outlined seven cases the author believed to be examples of innocent people being convicted of murder.|$|E

5|$|Unable to {{definitely}} {{prove to}} the court where their money had come from, Daniel and Wilson were eventually found guilty, and sentenced to 14 years' hard labour. However, the maximum term the Magistrate could legally impose was three months, and in 1896 they were released at {{the order of the}} High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Sir Henry Brougham Loch. The High Commissioner's legal team subsequently quashed the convictions altogether, saying that <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> Daniel and Wilson was not sufficiently conclusive. The existence of Lobengula's box of sovereigns was never proven either way, and the incident never explained beyond doubt.|$|E
5|$|Although too old {{to serve}} in the military, Blackburn {{supported}} the Confederate cause during the Civil War. In {{the early days of the}} war, he acted as a civilian agent for the governments of Kentucky and Mississippi. By 1863, he was aiding Confederate blockade runners in Canada. In 1864, he traveled to Bermuda to help combat a yellow fever outbreak that threatened Confederate blockade running operations there. Shortly after the war's end, a Confederate double agent accused him of having carried out a plot to start a yellow fever epidemic in the Northern United States that would have hampered the Union war effort. Blackburn was accused of collecting linens and garments used by yellow fever patients and smuggling them into the Northern states to be sold. <b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> Blackburn was considerable, although much of it was either circumstantial or provided by witnesses of questionable reputation. Although he was acquitted by a Toronto court, public sentiment was decidedly against him throughout much of the United States. Today, historians still disagree as to the strength of the evidence supporting Blackburn's role in the alleged plot. Any plot of this nature was destined to fail, however; in 1900, Walter Reed discovered that yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes, not by contact.|$|E
5|$|Anne's {{downfall}} came {{shortly after}} she had recovered from her final miscarriage. Whether it was primarily the result of allegations of conspiracy, adultery, or witchcraft remains {{a matter of debate}} among historians. Early signs of a fall from grace included the King's new mistress, the 28-year-old Jane Seymour, being moved into new quarters, and Anne's brother, George Boleyn, being refused the Order of the Garter, which was instead given to Nicholas Carew. Between 30 April and 2 May, five men, including Anne's brother, were arrested on charges of treasonable adultery and accused of having sexual relationships with the queen. Anne was also arrested, accused of treasonous adultery and incest. Although <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> them was unconvincing, the accused were found guilty and condemned to death. George Boleyn and the other accused men were executed on 17 May 1536. At 8am on 19 May 1536, Anne, age 36, was executed on Tower Green.|$|E

The paper {{also reported that}} Walush had been running a speakeasy {{and that she had}} been threatened with arrest if she refused to testify against Majczek and Marcinkiewicz. They also reported that the reason Judge Molthrop had failed to grant the defendants new trials was that he had been warned by prosecutors that granting a new trial would end his career in politics.|$|R
