5|$|Benioff and Weiss {{sometimes}} assign {{characters to}} particular writers; for example, Cogman {{was assigned to}} Arya Stark for the fourth season. The writers spend several weeks writing a character outline, including what material from the novels to use and the overarching themes. After <b>these</b> <b>individual</b> outlines are complete, they spend another {{two to three weeks}} discussing each main character's individual arc and arranging them episode by episode. A detailed outline is created, with each of the writers working on a portion to create a script for each episode. Cogman, who wrote two episodes for the fifth season, took {{a month and a half}} to complete both scripts. They are then read by Benioff and Weiss, who make notes, and parts of the script are rewritten. All ten episodes are written before filming begins, since they are filmed out of order with two units in different countries.|$|E

The Prussian war cabinet understood that its only supporters among the German states against the Habsburgs were two small principalities bordering on Brandenburg that had little military strength or political clout: the Grand Duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. They also understood that Prussia's only ally abroad was Italy.|$|E

5|$|Priestley's friends, {{particularly}} other Rational Dissenters, {{urged him}} to publish a work on the injustices experienced by Dissenters; the result was his Essay on the First Principles of Government (1768). An early work of modern liberal political theory and Priestley's most thorough treatment of the subject, it—unusually for the time—distinguished political rights from civil rights with precision and argued for expansive civil rights. Priestley identified separate private and public spheres, contending {{that the government should}} only have control over the public sphere. Education and religion, in particular, he maintained, were matters of private conscience and should not be administered by the state. Priestley's later radicalism emerged from his belief that the British government was infringing upon <b>these</b> <b>individual</b> freedoms.|$|E

These issues were the many issues that Swift cared about and saw as threatening Ireland before Wood's halfpence controversy. However, <b>these</b> <b>individual</b> issues {{were not as}} important as the independence and unity of Ireland: the specifics of independence were less important than self-rule. Some argue that Swift, after Wood's patent was withdrawn, removed himself from the political landscape to focus on writing Gulliver's Travels, in which he picked up many of the same ideas.|$|E
5|$|Regarding {{the primary}} {{function}} of conscious processing, a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information-processing {{that would otherwise}} be independent. This has been called the integration consensus. Another example has been proposed by Gerald Edelman called dynamic core hypothesis which puts emphasis on reentrant connections that reciprocally link areas of the brain in a massively parallel manner. Edelman also stresses the importance of the evolutionary emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans from the historically older trait of primary consciousness which humans share with non-human animals (see Neural correlates section above). These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness: differentiation and unity. They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details (differentiation) because it integrates those details from our sensory systems, while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of <b>these</b> <b>individual</b> parts. However, it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays, nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness. Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyses, etc.) and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect. Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious. For a review of the differences between conscious and unconscious integrations, see the article of E. Morsella.|$|E

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. It is {{an unfortunate}} {{occurrence}} in Hawaiʻi that many locally raised Filipino individuals grow up viewing their ethnicity as a stigma. This leads many of <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> {{to develop a}} sense of shame about their ethnic background and they often reject a Filipino identity. While <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> reject their Filipino identity they attempt to pass as another ethnicity or simply claim local in an attempt to shed any ethnic ties they have to the Filipino community. Although <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> reject their Filipino background growing up, many of <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> reconnect and "rediscover" their Filipino identity between the ages of 18 and 23, often in a college setting where they have access to learn about their Filipino heritage (Strobel 1996). Learning about the Filipino culture allows <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> to discover the various forms of capital, known as community cultural wealth (Yosso 2005), that exist within the Filipino culture and {{develop a sense of}} pride in their Filipino background. This study focuses on the experiences of twelve individuals, who have undergone this process of shifting from rejecting a Filipino ethnic identity to embracing and accepting a Filipino ethnic identity. Through semi-structured interviews with <b>these</b> <b>individuals,</b> who were raised in Hawaiʻi, the processes of rejection and acceptance were examined. The research examines how and why <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> internalized the negative stereotypes about Filipinos, such as "Filipinos are uneducated," "Filipinos are simple wage workers," and "Filipinos are rude. " The research further examines how <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> coped with <b>these</b> internalized stereotypes by (a) claiming another ethnicity, (b) claiming to be local Filipino or just local, and (c) being ambivalent about their ethnicity. Finally, this study examines the processes that allowed <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> to begin to accept a Filipino ethnic identity and examines the importance of (a) becoming a role model, (b) breaking the stereotypes about being Filipino, and (c) reframing the idea of Filipino in a positive fashion. Overall, this study sheds light on the impact that stereotypes and a colonial mentality have on the development of a Filipino ethnic identity in Hawaiʻi, which raises important theoretical questions about identity formation in marginalized groups, such as Filipino in Hawaiʻi...|$|R
