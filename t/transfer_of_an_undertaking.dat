[...] "Redundancy" [...] is an economic dismissal [...] "not related to the individual concerned" [...] (e.g. for poor work or misconduct). In University of Stirling v UCU the Supreme Court held that expiry of fixed term contracts, for 140 University teaching staff, did not count as a reason [...] "related to the individual", and so staff should have been consulted. An [...] "establishment" [...] includes [...] "a distinct entity that is ordinarily permanent, entrusted with performing specified tasks, namely primarily the sale of goods, and which has, to that end, several workers, technical means and an organisational structure in that the store is an individual cost centre managed by a manager." [...] In Lyttle v Bluebird UK Bidco 2 Ltd, the Court of Justice held this meant that Woolworths shops in Northern Ireland, each with under 20 employees, could claim to be separate establishments. More doubtfully, it was held by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in E Green & Sons (Castings) Ltd v ASTMS that three companies, all operating from the same premises, were different establishments {{even though they were}} part of the same group. There is considerable disagreement over when an employing entity must begin consulting: the Directive says when decision-makers are [...] "contemplating", while the Regulations say [...] "proposes". In AEK ry v Fujitsu Siemens Computers Oy the Court of Justice held consulting must begin [...] "once a strategic or commercial decision compelling him to contemplate or to plan for collective redundancies has been taken." [...] In groups of companies, where a parent controls the subsidiary, the duty to perform the consulting process falls on the subsidiary, but the duty begins as soon as the parent has contemplated that a particular subsidiary [...] "has been identified" [...] for redundancies for consulting [...] "to have any meaning". Consultation should take place with the recognised trade union first, but if there is none, then elected employee representatives, if necessary giving enough time to organise an election. Section 188(7) says that an employer has a [...] "defence" [...] for not consulting if there are [...] "exceptional circumstances", but this [...] "exception" [...] is not in the Directive, and courts have avoided applying it. Dismissals cannot take effect until meaningful negotiation has taken place. If employers fail to negotiate, they must pay a [...] "protective award" [...] of up to 90 days' pay to each employee. Essentially similar rules apply for consultation with staff before any <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>undertaking.</b>|$|E
50|$|Where {{outsourcing}} {{involves the}} <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>undertaking,</b> it {{is subject to}} Council Directive 77/187 of 14 February 1977, on the approximation {{of the laws of}} the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees’ rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses (as amended by Directive 98/50/EC of 29 June 1998; consolidated in Directive 2001/23 of 12 March 2001). Under that directive, rights acquired by employees with the former employer are to be safeguarded when they, together with the undertaking in which they are employed, are transferred to another employer, i.e., the contractor. An example of a case involving such contracting-out was the decision of the European Court of Justice in Christel Schmidt v. Spar- und Leihkasse der früheren Ämter Bordesholm, Kiel und Cronshagen, Case C-392/92 1994. Although subsequent decisions have disputed whether a particular contracting-out exercise constituted a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>undertaking</b> (see, for example, Ayse Süzen v. Zehnacker Gebäudereinigung GmbH Krankenhausservice, Case C-13/95 1997), in principle, employees of an enterprise outsourcing part of its activities in which they are employed may benefit from the protection offered by the directive.|$|E

No tangible assets were taken over by the second service provider. The office in the hospital building that had been used by the first service provider was no longer available. The second company reemployed four of the first company’s nineteen employees. The other employees, including the two plaintiffs, were not offered employment. The EFTA Court ruled that a mere succession of two contracts for the provision of the same or similar services will not, as a rule, be sufficient for there to be a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>undertaking,</b> business, or part of a business within the meaning of the Transfer of Undertakings Directive 77/187/EEC.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (LLM (Mercantile Law)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The {{freedom to}} <b>transfer</b> <b>an</b> <b>undertaking</b> is part <b>of</b> the employer’s freedom of contract. The {{transferee}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>undertaking</b> under {{the common law}} {{has the right to}} choose whether he wants to contract with employees or not. By the implementation of section 197 of the Labour Relations Act (1995) and the amended sections 197, 197 <b>A</b> <b>of</b> the Labour Relations Act (2002) the legislator provides for an automatic transfer in cases where the undertaking is transferred as a going concern. The former accordance with the regulations of the insolvency law and the fact that sequestration or the winding-up <b>of</b> <b>an</b> insolvent <b>undertaking</b> had to be to the advantage of the creditors was lost after the legislative steps of 1995. The effects of the above-mentioned sections and especially the problems regarding the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> insolvent undertakings shall be analysed in this thesis. It is the aim of this thesis to examine how sections 197, 197 <b>A</b> <b>of</b> the Labour Relations Act and section 38 of the Insolvency Act should be applied and interpreted to achieve social justice. This makes it necessary to examine the history and development of the South African law <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> insolvent <b>undertaking</b> too. Section 197 of the Labour Relations Act is mostly based on European law. Although it is not the intention of this thesis to compare the European law with the South African law, several South African aspects will be examined from a European and especially German perspective...|$|R

40|$|During the 1980 s, {{the number}} of {{transfers}} of undertakings has doubled every three years at EU level, accounting for 40 per cent of the global number of business transfers. Yet limited research {{has been carried out}} to investigate how terms and conditions of employment and other work-related experience may have changed for the workers who have been transferred from the transferor employer to the transferee employer. Although relevant legislation (TUPE Regulations) is in place with the objective of protecting these workers&# 039; employment rights, the effectiveness of the regulations has proved less than convincing. The intention {{of this paper is to}} explore, through an in-depth case-study approach, the wider issues concerning employment relations and experience of work in the context of transfers of undertakings. This paper argues that TUPE provides only limited protection for the rights of the transferred workers with the transferee. When a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>undertaking</b> takes place, the employment relationship between the transferee and the transferred workers will be different even if the explicitly defined contractual terms and conditions remain unchanged...|$|E

40|$|The {{regulation}} of the social implications of transfers of undertakings is a topic that has made its way in the European law with quite enough difficulty, but became in time an increasingly discussed topic. Since the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>undertaking</b> from an employer to another could not be achieved with disregard of its human capital, the European legislator has established a legal framework ensuring the safeguarding of employees' rights {{in the event of}} transfers of undertakings. Currently, the main legal basis in the field consists of Council Directive 2001 / 23 /EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses - the Transfer Directive. The paper aims to achieve a critical analysis of European regulations on the protection of employees' rights in the event of transfer of undertakings {{as a result of a}} merger. The scope of the Transfer Directive, the obligation to inform and consult employees in advance and the transfer of rights and obligations arising from the contract of employment as a result of a merger are being approached. In the study, matters on which the current European legal framework requires improvements so that the achieving of its objective be possible beyond interpretation and controversy are highlighted...|$|E

The faster reactions involve the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electron from BPh− (BPh− is oxidised to BPh) to the electron acceptor quinone (QA), and the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electron to P960+ (P960+ is reduced to P960) from a heme in the cytochrome subunit above the reaction center.|$|R

The thesis is focused {{mainly on the}} history <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> right as security, its regulation in Civil code 2012 and it highlights the fundamental changes compared to its regulation in Civil code 1964. The regulation <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> right as security underwent considerable changes in Civil code 2012. However, the usage of this instrument in practice, compared to other security instruments, is not so common.

The main aim of this thesis is to evaluate the benefits of the regulation <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> right as security in Civil code 2012 as compared to 1964. Introductory chapters are dedicated to general issues of the law of obligations, focusing on changes of the basic terms.
