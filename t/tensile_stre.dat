40|$|Xenograft tendons {{have been}} used in few human studies, with {{variable}} results. With the advent of novel tissue processing techniques, which may mitigate against an immune - mediated rejection response without adversely affecting mech anical properties, there may now be a clinical role for xenograft tendons, particularly in knee ligament reconstruction. We hypothesize that ‘BioCleanse® ’ processed bovine extensor digitorum m edialis (EDM) tendons exhibit favorable time - zero pre - implantati on biomechanical characteristics when compared to both unprocessed bovine EDM tendons and BioCleanse® processed human cadaveric allograft tibialis anterior tendons. In this in vitro case controlled laboratory study, three groups of tendons underwent a 5 - stage static loading test protocol: 15 BioCleanse® bovine (BCB), 15 fresh frozen unprocessed bovine (FFB), and 12 BioCleanse® human allograft (BCA) tendons. Cross - sectional area of th e grafts was measured using an alginate molding technique, and tendons were mounted within an Instron® 5565 Materials Testing System using cryogenic clamps. BCB tendons displayed a higher ultimate tensile stress (p 0. 05). BCB tendons had an equivalent cross - sectional area to the BCA tendons (p> 0. 05) whilst exhibiting a greater failure load, ultimate <b>tensile</b> <b>stre</b> ss, less creep and a higher modu lus of elasticity (p< 0. 05). The BioCleanse® process d id not adversely affect the time - zero biomechanical roperties of bovine xenograft EDM tendons. BioCleanse® processed bovine xenograft EDM tendons exhibit ed superior biomechanical characteristics when 3 co mpared with BioCleanse® processed allograft tibialis anterior tendons. These findings support further investigation of xenograft tendons in orthopaedic soft tissue reconstructive surgery...|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{and uses}} of {{composites}} reinforced with natural fibers {{have been growing}} over the last decades. These composites offer economical, technical, societal and environmental advantages. As a consequence, they became promising alternatives to replace synthetic fibers from non-renewable sources. In this way, {{the study of the}} properties of these natural composites is of utmost importance to enable its use. The present work compares the tensile mechanical behavior of polymeric composites reinforced with natural eucalyptus fibers. Two matrices widely applied in the industry were used: epoxy and polyester. The results showed that in both cases the introduction of eucalyptus fibers had minor effect on the matrix reinforcement.

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} multi-analytical {{approach}} {{to determine the}} additives in historical mortars, the use of which is widely described in bibliographical sources, but has rarely {{been reported in the}} literature. A protocol to thoroughly analyse mortars was created (optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, thermal analyses and gas chromatography - mass spectrometry). These techniques, which had already been carried out on samples from various sites from the Roman to the modern era, determined that additives had only been used in the mortars from the internal masonry at our sampling site: the medieval military shipyard of Amalfi (Italy). The investigations yielded information on the production technology, and FT-IR and GC-MS revealed a saccharide material-based additive in the mortars, of plant origin. The FT-IR spectra suggested the presence of a natural gum, which has been used since ancient times to strengthen the cohesion properties of mortars and their resistance to <b>tensile</b> <b>stres...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Ni(110) c(2 × 2) -Sn surface phase {{has been}} {{investigated}} by the combination of quantitative {{low energy electron diffraction}} (LEED) with the aid of tensor LEED multiple scattering simulations, and medium energy ion scattering using 100 keV H+ incident ions. The structure is found to involve substitution of half of the outermost Ni atoms of the clean surface by Sn atoms, but the resulting single layer NiSn alloy is corrugated, with the Sn atoms being 0. 40 ± 0. 03 Å higher above the underlying Ni substrate than the outermost Ni atoms. The results are discussed in the context of previous structural studies of similar surface alloy phases; a weak trend for the amplitude of the corrugation in Ni/Sn surface alloys to become smaller as the surface layer packing density reduces may be consistent with previous ideas {{of the role of the}} depletion of valence electron density in the surface layer and the associated surface <b>tensile</b> <b>stres...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{qualitative}} {{effects of}} residual stress parameters on fatigue crack growth are investigated using Monte Carlo probabilistic analysis technique. These parameters include the maximum residual stress,σ 0, half-width of the tensile residual stress region, b, and the redistribution of residual stress parameter, β. A normal distribution is assumed for all parameters {{considered in the}} investigation and fatigue life is determined using Forman equation. The results indicate that: (i) fatigue life decreases nonlinearly if the mean of random maximum residual stress and the half-width of tensile residual stress region increases; (ii) fatigue life increases nonlinearly if the rate of residual stress redistribution increases; (iii) the effects of COV of maximum residual stress, half-width of <b>tensile</b> residual <b>stres...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thin {{films of}} ceria, titania and {{zirconia}} {{have been prepared}} using ion assisted deposition (IAD). The energy of ions was varied between 0 and 1 keV and current densities up to 220 μA/cm 2 were used. It {{was found that the}} stress behaviour is dependent on ion species, i. e. argon or oxygen, ion energy and current density and substrate temperature apart from the material. While ceria films showed tensile stresses under the influence of argon ion bombardment at ambient temperature, they showed a sharp transition from tensile to compressive stress with increase in substrate temperature. When bombarded with oxygen ions they showed a transition from tensile to compressive stress with increase in energy. The titania films deposited with oxygen ions, on the other hand showed purely tensile stresses. Zirconia films deposited with oxygen ions, however, showed a transition from <b>tensile</b> to compressive <b>stres...</b>|$|R
