It concerns ca. 60 thousand pages (as published in the Official Journal of the European Communities) and it is due to end by mid 2003. The quality of legal translations is the most important factor and a particular approach is adopted in order to ensure terminology consistency and legal correctness of these texts. The project comprises several stages – translation of primary legislation followed by the translation of secondary legislation and finally the translation of case law. Having in mind how important terminology consistency is, not only within one text but also within the whole project, the necessity for the elaboration of common terminology resources became clear.

40|$|Using lexical {{semantic}} {{knowledge to}} solve {{natural language processing}} problems has been getting popular in recent years. Because semantic processing relies heavily on lexical semantic knowledge, the construction of lexical semantic databases has become urgent. WordNet is the most famous English semantic knowledge database at present; many researches of word sense disambiguation adopt it as a standard. Because {{of the success of}} WordNet, there is a trend to construct WordNet in different languages. In this paper, we propose a methodology for constructing Chinese WordNet by extracting information from a bilingual <b>terminology</b> <b>bank.</b> We developed an algorithm of word-to-word alignment to extract the English-Chinese translation-equivalent word pairs first. Then, the algorithm disambiguates word senses and maps Chinese word senses to WordNet synsets to achieve the goal. In the word-to-word alignment experiment, this alignment algorithm achieves the f-score of 98. 4 %. In the word sense disambiguation experiment, the extracted senses cover 36. 89 % of WordNet synsets and the accuracy of the three proposed disambiguation rules achieve the accuracies of 80 %, 83 % and 87 %, respectively...|$|E

The reasons why such a tool is sorely needed are many, and include:- fostering methods of self-learning in the workplace- furthering access to vocational training- promoting equality of opportunity- adapting to industrial changes The VOCALL project resulted from a merging of two consortia—one containing DCU, ILSP and ILTEC, and the other FAS and top Schulung. A primary focus of the first of these groups, which remains to this day, was that of less widely used and taught languages (LWUTLs), namely Portuguese, Greek and Irish 2.

40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is the 'orientation' of {{multiple}} lexical terms and special language verb phrases. Orientation is a necessary step for two main reasons: ascertaining the most logical placing of multiple lexical terms and special language verb phrases (combinants) in a dictionary; providing the most apposite terminological and terminographical background data for a multiple lexical term or phrase, these data being determined by the subject field of the text in which the term or phrase appears. The research has drawn together aspects such as collocation and valency, and analyses of corpora {{have resulted in the}} development of a model for special language verb phrases in English and French which it is proposed can be applied and adapted to different specialised subject fields. Past research into special language verb phrases has been sparse and, in contrast to general language, it does not appear that a model pertaining to this construction has been developed previously. Of additional novelty is the application of the model to special language verb phrases in French, because it is hoped that the results will act as a precursor for a dictionary of verb collocations in that language. It is intended that the results of the research will benefit: learners of a foreign language who may become translators, to enable them to seek a term or phrase easily and efficiently; subject specialists who prepare papers in a language which is not their mother tongue; technical writers; pre-editors of texts for machine translation; terminographers who need guidelines for entering compound terms and phrases in: (i) printed dictionaries and (ii) computerised systems such as <b>terminology</b> data <b>banks</b> (term banks).

40|$|Background: Patient {{registries}} {{are often}} a helpful first step in estimating the impact and understanding the etiology of rare diseases - both requisites {{for the development of}} new diagnostics and therapeutics. The value and utility of patient registries rely on the use of both well-constructed structured research questions and relevant answer sets accompanying them. There are currently no clear standards or specifications for developing registry questions, and there are no banks of existing questions to support registry developers. Objective: This paper introduces the [Rare Disease] PRISM (Patient Registry Item Specifications and Metadata for Rare Disease) project, a library of standardized questions covering a broad spectrum of rare diseases {{that can be used to}} support the development of new registries, including Internet-based registries. Methods: A convenience sample of questions was identified from well-established (3 ̆e 5 years) natural history studies in various diseases and from several existing registries. Face validity of the questions was determined by review by many experts (both terminology experts at the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and research and informatics experts at the University of South Florida (USF)) for commonality, clarity, and organization. Questions were re-worded slightly, as needed, to make the full semantics of the question clear and to make the questions generalizable to multiple diseases where possible. Questions were indexed with metadata (structured and descriptive information) using a standard metadata framework to record such information as context, format, question asker and responder, and data standards information. Results: At present, PRISM contains over 2, 200 questions, with content of PRISM relevant to virtually all rare diseases. While the inclusion of disease-specific questions for thousands of rare disease organizations seeking to develop registries would present a challenge for traditional standards development organizations, the PRISM library could serve as a platform to liaison between rare disease communities and existing standardized controlled <b>terminologies,</b> item <b>banks,</b> and coding systems. Conclusions: If widely used, PRISM will enable the re-use of questions across registries, reduce variation in registry data collection, and facilitate a bottom-up standardization of patient registries. Although it was initially developed to fulfill an urgent need in the rare disease community for shared resources, the PRISM library of patient-directed registry questions can be a valuable resource for registries in any disease – whether common or rare.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the views of}} UK-based Muslims, Islamic Scholars and Islamic banking employees on {{the current state of}} the latter industry, both in practical terms and as regards engagement with the nation’s large, but often marginalised Islamic community. The British Government has recently championed the Islamic banking sector and committed to supporting it as a means of addressing financial services needs and consolidating London’s position as the global centre for Islamic investment. The analysis adds to the substantive literature in two principal ways: (i) by contextualising the evidence via the notions of empowerment, engagement and social justice that underpin both the state’s attempts to foster growth and the central tenets of Islam; and (ii) by placing comparison of the opinions of key groups at the heart of the investigation. The findings reveal that while progress has been made, UK-based Muslims see several substantive impediments to access, including the complex <b>terminology</b> of Islamic <b>banking</b> products, the lack of internet banking facilities and branch networks as well as a generalised lack of interest in marketing on the part of the institutions. Whilst some coincidence of perception is evident, the views of bankers are shown to be out of line with those of the other parties in a number of key areas. For example, bankers appear to see less potential in the role of the internet as a medium for spreading awareness than do either potential customers or religious scholars. The paper therefore concludes with a call for multi-party Ijtihad and Qiyas (deductive analogy) that will encourage industrial outreach and, in so doing, support long-term growth...|$|R
