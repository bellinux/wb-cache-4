5|$|While in Washington, Lead Belly {{encountered}} {{several other}} incidents of segregation that {{are believed to}} have contributed to the impetus of the song. For instance, when Lead Belly, Lomax, and their wives wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> dinner together, they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them. Lead Belly was told that if he returned later without Lomax, he would be served.|$|E
5|$|From {{the moment}} the egg is hatched, the male {{macaroni}} penguin cares for the newly hatched chick. For about 23 to 25 days, the male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm, since {{only a few of}} its feathers have grown in by this time. The female brings food to the chick every one to two days. When they are not being protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form crèches to keep warm and stay protected. Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70days, they are ready <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea on their own.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the storm in India, {{government}} officials there issued a severe storm warning for Thoothukudi District, and also warned fishermen not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea. Thousands were evacuated to emergency shelters prior to the storm's arrival. The cyclone produced rough surf along the southern Indian coast, and heavy rainfall in and around Thoothukudi, causing flooding in a few low-lying areas. The rainfall caused some damage to banana crops, uprooted several trees, and left some roads impassable, but was largely beneficial in alleviating drought conditions. Across southern India, the cyclone damaged 749houses and destroyed 81more, but no deaths were reported in the country.|$|E

5|$|Robin {{becomes a}} roommate to Katherine, {{who is still}} feeling {{depressed}} after her recent stint in a mental hospital. Robin encourages Katherine <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> a bar, and the two have a great time. When two men hit on Robin and show no interest in Katherine, Robin shows them up by kissing Katherine on the lips. Katherine initially laughs at the funny moment, but later learns Robin really is a lesbian. Katherine insists she {{is not interested in}} women when Robin suggests she explores the possibility, but later it appears that Katherine may be intrigued by the idea.|$|E
5|$|White {{said that}} The Troubles in Northern Ireland induced {{him to write}} about the sort of world he would like to live in, and that he disliked war and militarists. As a youth he wanted to become a doctor, but had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> work. Hence he relied on {{epidemics}} and natural disasters to provide the conflicts that stories need to make them interesting. He credited his wife, who was an intensive care nurse at the height of The Troubles, for advice on medical details and for pointing out how padres often did more good than doctors for disturbed patients, which inspired The Genocidal Healer.|$|E
5|$|As {{the patrons}} leave due to not {{receiving}} a refund, the pictures going black {{when they were}} getting to important scenes, and complain about {{the taste of the}} popcorn (due to the mess the babies have made in the concession stand), Stu is angry at the fact that The Land Without Smiles went out at the climax. But at least they think that Tommy can go through a whole movie without any fuss. Because they didn't see the ending, Didi and Stu decide <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> see the movie again next week, but at a different theater. As Grandpa Lou eats a candy bar in the back seat, Tommy takes notice of a flashing Reptar billboard as they drive by.|$|E

When he is done and the other attendees have left, he sees an unusual butterfly. Upon picking it up, he experiences a cut on his hand and is then attacked by a swarm. Mark jumps out of a window, to his death. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), despite preparing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> dinner with her sister, instead agrees to Phillip Broyles' (Lance Reddick) demand that she join the Fringe team's investigation at the scene. While examining the body, Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) sees lacerations on Young’s skin and notes a lack of corresponding tears on his shirt. At the scene, Olivia has a brief vision of her deceased lover John Scott (Mark Valley) watching them, which troubles her.|$|E
5|$|The German {{government}} {{had been hoping}} that the Ottomans would enter the war to support them but the government in Istanbul was undecided. The Germanophile Ottoman War Minister, Enver Pasha, began conspiring with the German ambassador to bring the empire into the war. Attempts to secure widespread support in the government failed, so Enver decided conflict {{would have to be}} instigated. With the help of the Ottoman naval minister and German Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, Enver arranged for the Ottoman fleet <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea on 29 October supposedly to perform maneuvers. They were to provoke Russian vessels into opening fire and then accuse them of inciting war. Instead, Souchon raided the Russian coast in a flagrant display of hostility, causing little lasting damage but enraging the Russians.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} of {{qualifying}} started problematically, as the red {{light at the end}} of the pitlane, indicating that cars had to stop, was still on when the clock began to run. A marshal with a green flag then indicated the drivers to take to the track. During the session, Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, but a mistake by Nico Rosberg meant that Vettel was able to place second. Daniil Kvyat was the first driver to be eliminated, lining up behind the two McLaren drivers, with debutant Vandoorne out-qualifying his teammate Button. Nico Hülkenberg was the only driver <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> improve his time, managing to proceed into Q3 in eighth place, leaving Grosjean, Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz Jr. behind.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Noul, {{known as}} Typhoon Dodong within the country, entered the Philippine area of Responsibility on May7. In {{response}} to the storm, PAGASA raised warning signal 4, the highest level, for northeastern Cagayan {{as well as the}} offshore Batanes and Babuyan Islands. Neighboring provinces had lower warning signals. A total of 3,803people evacuated their homes in Cagayan and Isabela to 27storm shelters; families returned home by late on May10 after the storm moved ashore without causing much damage. Flights and ferry routes were canceled, stranding 10,000people. The Philippine Army deployed 18soldiers to assist in storm preparations, utilizing boats and helicopters. Fishermen were advised not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea east of Luzon. People were also evacuated from the vicinity of Mount Bulusan after rains from Noul threatened to cause lahars and mudslides from ash of a recent eruption. They were allowed to return after Noul recurved to the north and the threat did not materialize. Two people in Cagayan died due to electrocution while attempting to fix their roofs ahead of the storm.|$|E

25|$|In Toronto, blockos are {{a form of}} block party {{based on}} a {{tradition}} of outdoor gatherings in the West Indies. They are held by neighbours and outreach workers, particularly during the city's warm, humid summers. Daytime activities are focused on children, and the evenings provide an alternative for residents who cannot afford <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> restaurants, clubs, etc. Since the 1970s many blockos have been held each year at Toronto Community Housing Corporation (TCHC) developments without incident.|$|E
25|$|The sergeants were of {{interest}} to SHAI since they belonged to the field security unit and worked with the Tulkarm police, which {{was in charge of}} the Sharon district. Their mission was to circulate within the local population and pick up information on the Irgun and Lehi and their supporters. They often operated in civilian clothes and were not subject to standing orders intended to prevent abduction attempts. Notably, they did not have to leave camp in groups of four, and sometimes went unarmed. Weinberg was very successful in his task, and occasionally got the sergeants <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the Netanya beach.|$|E
25|$|The {{foraging}} activity of Vespula vulgaris {{is dependent on}} the light and temperature of the surrounding area. Generally, if the temperature of the surrounding area falls below 2°C, the wasps will not proceed with foraging even if the temperature of the nest itself is optimal. When the temperature is above 2°C, light intensity comes in to play a role. If the light intensity is high enough, the wasps will fly off to forage. However, there is a wide variance within the species, and even within individuals what that threshold light intensity would be – i. e. when would be the best light intensity for a wasp <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> forage.|$|E

25|$|Colonists' {{hopes of}} peace rose {{over the summer}} of 1830-31 as Aboriginal attacks fell to a low level and the Colonial Times {{newspaper}} speculated that their enemy had either been wiped out or frightened into inaction. But the north remained a dangerous place: on 29 January a Dairy Plains woman was murdered—three months after her husband {{had died in a}} similar attack—and in March a mother carrying her infant was fatally speared while working in her garden on the East Tamar. Though the number of attacks in 1831 was {{less than a third of}} those the previous year—a total of 70, compared with 250 in 1830—settlers remained so fearful that many men refused <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> work.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} Nattapara in Hooghly district, a remote village in Balagarh block. There are some 100 dhakis in the village. There {{is not a}} single family without a dhaki. All used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> work as dhakis during the festive season, but now the demand has {{declined}} {{to such an extent that}} many are forced to give up the traditional profession and work as wage labourers. Worse still, a dhaki from the village was contacted by a well-known Durga Puja in Kolkata for Rs. 2,000. After he had performed his duties they paid him less and insulted him. It is not an isolated incident and there are similar complaints from dhakis in the Tarakeswar and Dhaniakhali regions.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} slogan campaigns for Bull Durham was the “Roll Your Own” campaign. The campaign came at an ideal time, as product sales were low due to the competition against the emerging pre-rolled cigarette. These ads appeared {{around the time of the}} Great Depression and showed the low price of only a nickel per bag as well as an elegant scene with finely dressed, upper class looking people. This advertisement campaign originally had doubters, yet quickly these doubts were taken away when sales exploded. The ads made many in the middle and lower class want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> buy Bull Durham in order to emulate the upper class. The campaign was tremendously successful, using the desire for a better life to boost sales.|$|E
