500|$|No {{lingering}} {{about was}} allowed, no gossiping {{with the other}} actors; the women’s dressing-rooms were {{on one side of}} the stage, the men's on the other, and when we were not actually playing we had to mount at once our respective narrow staircases– sheep rigorously separated from the goats! [...] Once, when my mother came <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> London, expecting to find me dwelling in haunts of gilded luxury, and far down the road to perdition, I took her behind the scenes and showed her the arrangements for the actors and actresses, conventual in their austerity. ... I think there never was a theatre run on lines of such strict propriety; no breath of scandal ever touched it in all the twenty years of my experience. [...] Gilbert would suffer no loose word or gesture either behind the stage or on it, and watched over us young women like a dragon.|$|E
500|$|Because the CW is a fashion-orientated network, {{there were}} times Nikita had to be dressed {{in a certain way}} to get her noticed by her targets. Q liked the idea, {{but at the same time}} wanted Nikita's dress sense to be [...] "toned down a bit" [...] because she is an assassin. In one scene in {{particular}} Q had to wear a red bikini in the pilot, which [...] "mortified" [...] her. She added [...] "that red bikini was the bane of my existence. You're not going <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> a bikini again, that's for sure. [...] I was like, 'Danny, can you put me in a one-piece?,' and he gave me that red bikini. I was like, 'That's not a one-piece. That's a two-piece with a string.'" [...] However, Q did not have to cover her tattoos like she had to in the films, as it was in keeping with who the character is; a hardcore, street kid.|$|E
500|$|Prior {{to being}} cast in Glee, Colfer had no {{professional}} acting experience. He originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Artie Abrams, performing [...] "Mr. Cellophane" [...] from the musical Chicago. Murphy was so impressed by his performance that the role of Kurt was created for him. To keep the number of students in the glee club constant, a character named Rajish was cut from the show. Kurt's name is inspired by the character Kurt von Trapp from The Sound of Music, a role that Colfer once played as a child. The Hummel surname comes from the popular German Hummel figurines; Colfer explained in an interview that Murphy thought he had their rosy-cheeked complexion. Murphy praised Colfer's abilities despite his lack of formal training, saying, [...] "I just thought he was so talented and gifted and unusual. I've never seen anyone who looks like him or acts like him or sounds like him. You'd think he’d been at Juilliard for six years but he hasn't." [...] Murphy saw something of himself in the young actor, a fact that Colfer says is [...] "completely mind-blowing". Colfer added, [...] "For him <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> him, I can't even describe it." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{week before}} the tour began, Spears said of the show: [...] "I come from Broadway, so I {{want it to be}} very theatrical. The whole process for me is magical. Hopefully it will be {{something}} people have never even imagined or envisioned in their head. I was going through a run-through yesterday and was thinking, 'By the time I'm 30, there's not going to be anything left for me to do'". Initial rehearsals for the band started on September 9, 2001. She joined them later after rehearsing the choreography in Los Angeles. [...] The setlist was composed mostly by songs from Britney. She explained her decision in a press conference, saying, [...] "I just want my fans <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> a different light than they have ever seen me [...] before. This music I am singing right now is such a reflection of me and who I am. Hopefully [...] will come to the show and be inspired and have a lot of fun." [...] Several songs from her previous albums ...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again were remixed by Robson to [...] "take [...] in a new direction– flip [...] up a bit".|$|E
500|$|Chuck Taylor also {{reviewed}} [...] "I Want You to Need Me" [...] {{and wrote}} that linking Dion and Diane Warren {{has always been}} about [...] "as fine a fit as a trusty pair of Thom McAn's." [...] Between Warren's [...] "heart-drenched" [...] words and dramatic melody writing and Dion's [...] "potent vocals straight from soulside, divadom has never sounded so mighty." [...] According to him, for fans of Dion's [...] "high-caliber" [...] power ballads, this is truly among the best ever and a highlight on All the Way... A Decade of Song. Longing for romantic attention, Dion sings, [...] "I want you [...] to need me, like the air you breathe/I {{want you to feel}} me, in everything/I want you <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me,</b> <b>in</b> your every dream/The way that I taste you, feel you, breathe you, need you." [...] Taylor stated that Warren's trusty melody is wholly natural and free-flowing, while production from the usually rock-oriented Matt Serletic is [...] "sheer perfection". It all peaks from the glorious midsection through to the end, where Dion delivers exactly what we've come to expect: a crescendo as [...] "spine-tingling" [...] as those first few times we heard [...] "My Heart Will Go On".|$|E
2500|$|The {{band members}} started {{to discuss the}} {{possibility}} of a Europe reunion in 1998. [...] "Mic and Ian came over <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> Ireland," [...] Tempest said, [...] "Then whilst we were there, John Norum called from LA, and we were like 'Yes, maybe now is the right time to get things started again'." [...] For the 2000 millennium celebrations, Europe was asked to do a concert in Stockholm on New Year's Eve 1999. That would be Europe's first and, to date, only concert with both of their lead guitarists, since both John Norum and Kee Marcello had accepted the offer to play that evening {{with the rest of the}} group. They played [...] "Rock the Night" [...] and [...] "The Final Countdown".|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen. If {{you go back}} on the job--then it 'll be {{all right}} for you to run <b>in</b> heah <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> once <b>in</b> a while. But if you throw up this chance I'll--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The {{last time}} they came <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> was <b>in</b> {{the middle of the}} summer. They {{threatened}} all sorts of things, and they got me so mad that I had to take down my shotgun and warn them away. Then they left in a big hurry." ...|$|R
2500|$|Capp also lampooned popular {{recording}} idols of the day, such as Elvis Presley ("Hawg McCall," [...] 1957), Liberace ("Loverboynik," [...] 1956), the Beatles ("the Beasties," [...] 1964)—and in 1944, Frank Sinatra. [...] "Sinatra was {{the first}} great public figure I ever wrote about," [...] Capp once said. [...] "I called him 'Hal Fascinatra.' I remember my news syndicate was so worried about what his reaction might be, {{and we were all}} surprised when he telephoned and told me how thrilled he was with it. He always {{made it a point to}} send me champagne whenever he happened <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> a restaurant..." [...] (from Frank Sinatra, My Father by Nancy Sinatra, 1985). On the other hand, Liberace was [...] "cut to the quick" [...] over Loverboynik, according to Capp, and even threatened legal action—as would Joan Baez later, over [...] "Joanie Phoanie" [...] in 1967.|$|E
2500|$|... “When I saw {{the great}} White Chief I {{thought he was}} a great man. [...] When I heard him speak, then I felt sure he was a great man. [...] But the White Chief is not as the big men in out tribes. [...] He wore no plumes and no decorations. [...] He had none of his young men (warriors) with him, and only that I heard him talk he would have been to me as other white men. [...] But my brother Mr. Gladstone came <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> my lodge as a friend, and I was glad to see the White Chief, for though my tongue was tied in his {{presence}} my heart was in full friendship. [...] After he went away they told me that half of his great nation of white men have adopted him as their chief. [...] If he were not both good and wise, so many young men of his nation would have never taken him for their leader.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 18, 1964, Jackie Mason {{allegedly}} gave Sullivan {{the finger}} on air. A {{tape of the}} incident shows Mason doing his stand-up comedy act and then looking toward Sullivan, commenting that Sullivan was signaling him. Sullivan was reportedly letting Mason know (by pointing two fingers) that he had only two minutes left, as CBS was about to cut away to show a speech by President Lyndon Johnson. Mason began working his own fingers into his act and pointed toward Sullivan with his middle finger slightly separated. After Mason left the stage, the camera then cut to a visibly angry Sullivan. Sullivan argued with Mason backstage, then terminated his contract. Mason denied knowingly giving Sullivan the middle finger, and Mason later claimed {{that he had never}} even heard of the gesture at that time. In retaliation, to protect the perceived threat to his career, Mason filed a libel suit at the New York Supreme Court, which he won. Sullivan publicly apologized to Mason when he appeared on the show two years later, in 1966. At that time, Mason opened his monologue by saying, [...] "It's a great thrill and a fantastic opportunity <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> person again," [...] and impersonated Sullivan during his act. [...] Mason later appeared on the show five times: April 23, 1967; Feb. 25, 1968; Nov. 24, 1968; Jul. 22, 1969; and Aug. 31, 1969.|$|E
60|$|Knowledge of {{what was}} brewing reached us from the Papal Nuncio in Madrid, who came <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> one day <b>in</b> the matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes it {{was truly}} him, an' I didn't want him <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> there <b>in</b> such company, an' he most likely knowin' I was on my bridal-trip, an' so I made a dive at my bonnet <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if I had a vail on; an' findin' one, I hauled it down.|$|R
6000|$|From {{time to time}} Quilla came <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> also <b>in</b> this garden, bearing {{gifts of}} flowers, and with her I talked alone.

2500|$|Dominic Treadwell-Collins was {{appointed}} {{executive producer of}} EastEnders in August 2013, but in December 2013, he said that Mick and Linda [...] "were in my head {{about a year and}} a half ago", adding that they are influenced by his own parents. For Mick's announcement, Treadwell-Collins said: [...] "I'm so excited to have actors of Danny and Kellie's calibre joining what is an already strong and talented company of actors." [...] Dyer said at the time of the announcement, [...] "I am so excited about starting a new chapter in my career and cannot wait to become part of the East End family." [...] Later in the same month, Dyer said that becoming the new pub landlord was [...] "like the perfect marriage. To take over The Queen Vic on Christmas Day, to be on primetime TV on the BBC's flagship show... I want to show people what I can do." [...] Dyer said in the Daily Star that he was not nervous joining EastEnders, but that he was excited and [...] "can't wait for everyone <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the Vic", joking that he hoped his character would not have sex with Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace). The programme had suffered falling ratings in 2013, and Dyer told Inside Soap that he wanted to [...] "help turn EastEnders around". When asked by Heat if he would be [...] "the saviour" [...] of EastEnders, he said that he would, and said, [...] "a lot of people were excited about me going to EastEnders [...] there's a lot of people who want to see me fail", adding that it was a risk that [...] "could work or couldn't work". Controller of BBC One, Charlotte Moore, said in December 2013 that Dyer [...] "is an extraordinary presence on the set of EastEnders—it's very exciting. He's just a big, big character and bringing him into the Vic is going to change a lot of the dynamics of EastEnders". Shane Richie, who plays previous landlord Alfie Moon, said Mick and the rest of the Carters would [...] "change the dynamics of the Queen Vic", confirming that their arrival was [...] "the big Christmas storyline".|$|E

I've had it out with him, and he won't want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> again <b>in</b> a hurry," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Brown, with a sudden kindling of the eye that reminded Bab of Ben's face when he shook her after losing Sancho.|$|R

6000|$|... "And {{she has had}} a very {{difficult}} game to play, Mrs. Bold--a {{very difficult}} game. Poor Madeline's unfortunate marriage and terrible accident, my mother's ill-health, my father's absence from England, and last, and worse perhaps, my own roving, idle spirit have almost been too much for her.

60|$|I {{felt the}} blow more {{severely}} than the servants {{or anyone else}} about me supposed. Still I was a child in years, and I had the blessed elasticity of a child's nature.
