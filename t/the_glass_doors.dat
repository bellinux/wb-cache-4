25|$|The small outer {{lobby is}} meant to evoke {{feelings}} of entering the outer chamber of an ancient Egyptian tomb. The walls of the outer lobby are built from huge unadorned blocks with a faux sandstone surface. The front of the ticket box office is decorated in a dusky sienna red with a golden sunburst emblazoned above the window. Past the outer lobby of the DeKalb Egyptian Theatre, through <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> and into the main lobby, the original mosaic-tiled floor and the towering 40 foot (12.2 m) ceiling are both revealed.|$|E
25|$|All {{passenger}} cars were air conditioned. The passages between {{the cars were}} wide and without doors, the seat pitch of 102 (second class) and 111cm (first class) was larger than on any other German train. Furthermore, the doors were unusually wide and featured steps that deployed automatically when the doors were opened to make entry as convenient as possible, and <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> dividing the two major areas of the intermediate cars were opened by proximity sensors. The ICE1 was the first German train in which smokers and non-smokers were separated not into {{different parts of the}} same car, but to different cars altogether.|$|E
60|$|He {{came to a}} full stop.

25|$|The 2007 Glasgow Airport {{attack was}} a {{terrorist}} ramming attack which occurred on 30 June 2007, at 15:11 BST, when a dark green Jeep Cherokee loaded with propane canisters was driven at <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> of the Glasgow Airport terminal and set ablaze. It was the first terrorist attack {{to take place in}} Scotland since the Lockerbie bombing in 1988. The attack took place three days after the appointment of Scottish MP Gordon Brown as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but Downing Street dismissed suggestions of a connection. A close link was quickly established to the 2007 London car bombs the previous day. Although the doors were damaged, security bollards outside the entrance stopped the car from entering the terminal, where there were 4,000 people, with the potential for many fatalities.|$|E
25|$|After the two {{retreat to}} the chapel, Max tells Nancy that her real life {{counterpart}} is Max's mother. They bid each other a tearful farewell before Nancy sacrifices herself by luring Billy with a striptease. Max collapses, but, now the final girl, she awakens {{with the power to}} kill Billy. They fight and she eventually decapitates him with his own machete. A wounded Chris arrives and the two kiss, while Camp Bloodbath closing credits play in the sky. Later, Max wakes to find herself in the hospital, where she is reunited with her friends. The group hears Billy Murphy's approach tune, and realize they are in the sequel, Camp Bloodbath 2: Cruel Summer. Billy crashes through <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> of the hospital as the title appears. Using a drip stand as a weapon, Max lunges at Billy, before the film abruptly ends.|$|E

[...] Santa attire was encouraged on Saturday, December 13, 2008, and zombie attire was encouraged the next day, {{as part of an}} attempt to set a Guinness World Record for number of zombies on ice.

500|$|The LeJeune Steel Company of Minneapolis was the {{subcontractor}} for {{the structural}} steel. The pavilion's concrete walls frame the orchestra shell space, which is [...] wide, [...] tall {{and has no}} support columns. The pavilion's roof rests on a dozen north–south trusses supported by east–west truss girders. The {{south side of the}} orchestra shell space is enclosed by <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> of the proscenium, which are about [...] tall, [...] wide and function like aircraft hangar doors made of glass. They were the largest doors that Glass Solutions of Elmhurst, Illinois, ever produced; the thickness of the glass was a design problem for the steel supports.|$|E
500|$|Historically, the U-Drop Inn {{held two}} {{separate}} businesses that shared a single interior wall. The west side, commonly called [...] "Tower Station" [...] "is {{dominated by a}} large four-sided obelisk rising from the flat roof and topped by a metal [...] "tulip"." [...] The tower displayed the station name, Conoco, in all capital letters on each side, with neon lighting on the corners. Vertical-rubbed detailing goes along the base of both towers, {{as well as two}} canopies that extend south and west from the western tower. The posts of the canopies were originally encased in decorative glazed tile and vintage metal signs. Between the canopy posts are fuel islands designed to hold three fuel pumps each. 1960s-vintage pumps are situated on the islands, with three on the western canopy and two on the southern. A chamfered corner separates the two canopies. Multiple-pane windows surround <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> of the office station, as well as dominating much of the southern side of the building. Situated between the office and the café are two service station bays with roll-up style overhead doors.|$|E

A second assault took place outside a take away restaurant; three men were taken inside the restaurant as refuge and the diners already inside were moved towards the back. <b>The</b> <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> and windows were broken and those inside were moved outside without incident.|$|E

The Red Room was painted a dull Pomeranian red, and its ceiling was decorated with gold, silver, and copper stars and stripes of red, white, and blue. A fifty-foot jeweled Tiffany glass screen, supported by imitation marble columns, replaced <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> that separated the main corridor from the north vestibule.|$|E
