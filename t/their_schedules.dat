5|$|Guitarist Jim Matheos and keyboardist and vocalist Kevin Moore {{decided to}} work on a {{follow-up}} to Office of Strategic Influence after the two found they both had holes in <b>their</b> <b>schedules.</b> Drummer Mike Portnoy returned as a session musician rather than a full band member.

5|$|The players {{went out}} on strike in week 3. The main demand was free agency for all players with at least four years of service. The weekend's games were {{cancelled}} as the owners prepared teams of replacement players. According to owner Hugh Culverhouse, {{it would not be}} feasible to make up the cancelled games, with the TV networks already having <b>their</b> <b>schedules</b> set for the open weekend following the season.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} OSI album, Office of Strategic Influence, was {{released}} in 2003, Jim Matheos and Kevin Moore returned to their respective projects. Matheos released the album FWX and toured with Fates Warning. Moore moved from Costa Rica to Istanbul, Turkey. In 2004, he released the third Chroma Key album, Graveyard Mountain Home, and wrote the soundtrack (released as Ghost Book) to the Turkish horror film Okul. Matheos and Moore both had holes in <b>their</b> <b>schedules,</b> so decided {{to work on a}} second OSI album.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they did}} not fix <b>their</b> <b>schedules</b> to the clock in the modern sense, ancient civilizations {{adjusted}} daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of daytime, so that each daylight hour was longer during summer. For example, the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different scales for different months of the year: at Rome's latitude the third hour from sunrise, hora tertia, started by modern standards at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice, but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes. After ancient times, equal-length civil hours eventually supplanted unequal, so civil time no longer varies by season. Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as some monasteries of Mount Athos and all Jewish ceremonies.|$|E

Representatives of the Buffalo All-Americans and Rochester Jeffersons could not attend the meeting, but sent letters to Hay asking {{to be included in}} the league. Team representatives changed the league's name slightly to the American Professional Football Association and elected officers, installing Thorpe as president, Cofall as vice-president, Ranney as secretary-treasurer. Under the new league structure, teams created <b>their</b> <b>schedules</b> dynamically as the season progressed, so there were no minimum or maximum number of games needed to be played. Also, representatives of each team voted to determine the winner of the APFA trophy.|$|E

5|$|The Irish played yearly {{first-class}} matches {{with the}} Scots, only interrupted by world wars, until 1999, but all their other cricket depended upon touring international sides finding it convenient {{to include a}} visit to Ireland in <b>their</b> <b>schedules.</b> However, Ireland sometimes surprised Test nations on these occasions, beating the West Indies by 60 runs in a three-day match in Dublin in 1928, for example; it was Ireland's first match against the West Indies. In 1969, in a match played at Sion Mills in County Tyrone, the team defeated a West Indian side including Clive Lloyd and Clyde Walcott by nine wickets, after bowling them out for 25. This {{was the last time}} Ireland defeated a touring side until 2003, when they beat Zimbabwe by ten wickets.|$|E

5|$|Earl Ball, the Flyers' manager, {{heard about}} this {{gathering}} on August 29 and was interested in participating. The original four representatives then invited other professional teams to a second meeting on September 17.

5|$|Egyptian troops {{raised their}} {{national}} flag {{on the eastern}} bank of the canal at 14:35. By that time company and battalion-size units of Israeli tanks and infantry began reaching the Bar Lev Line, but were prevented from reaching their positions by Egyptian ambushes. Those tanks that broke through came under fire {{from the west bank}} ramparts. At 14:45, a second wave of infantry landed on the opposite bank. Subsequent waves of infantry arrived at fifteen-minute intervals. However, after the fourth wave, fatigue and technical problems with the boats gradually widened the time intervals. The Egyptians abandoned <b>their</b> <b>schedules,</b> giving priority to anti-tank teams and weaponry that could critically affect the battle. Amphibious vehicles were also used to cross equipment. The wooden carts were ferried to the east bank via boats, where they were initially lifted {{to the top of the}} sand wall with their loads. However, this method proved clumsy, and the carts were first emptied then lifted, after which they were re-loaded and dragged to troops on the front line. The carts greatly facilitated the supply and transportation of matériel on the east bank.|$|E
5|$|Representatives of four Ohio League teams—the Bulldogs, the Cleveland Tigers, the Dayton Triangles, and the Akron Pros—called {{a meeting}} on August 20, 1920, to discuss the {{formation}} of a new league.

They also agreed on a name for the circuit: the American Professional Football Conference. They then invited other professional teams to a second meeting on September 17. At that meeting, held at Bulldogs owner Ralph Hay's Hupmobile showroom in Canton, representatives of the Rock Island Independents, the Muncie Flyers, the Decatur Staleys, the Racine Cardinals, the Massillon Tigers, the Chicago Cardinals, and the Hammond Pros agreed to join the league.
