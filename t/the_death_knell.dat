5|$|The Citroën AX was {{launched}} without a twin in 1986, {{and the only}} other Talbot in development, the Arizona family hatchback, {{was launched}} instead as the Peugeot 309 {{at the end of}} 1985. Production of the Samba ended in May 1986, by which time 270,555 had been made, signalling {{the beginning of the end}} of the Talbot brand for passenger cars, <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> finally sounding the following year when the last Horizon rolled off the production line in Finland, although the brand survived on commercial vehicles until 1994.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Clements faced Republican state {{attorney}} general Eldon S. Dummit. While Clements managed to keep the Democrats united following the primary, Dummit had fractured the Republicans by attacking the administration of sitting Republican governor Simeon S. Willis and his preferred successor during the Republican primary. Dummit mounted a meager challenge by citing Clements' opposition to the Taft-Hartley Act, {{but this was not}} very effective. Dummit had replaced his campaign manager from the primary election, and when the ousted manager turned against him in the general election, it sounded <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> for his campaign. Clements won the election by a vote of 387,795 to 287,756. He resigned his seat in the U.S. House to accept the governorship.|$|E

5|$|The first streetcars {{appeared}} in 1889 and {{were instrumental in}} the creation of a relatively well-defined downtown and strong neighborhoods at the end of their lines. The advent of the automobile sounded <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> for rail in Seattle. Tacoma–Seattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett–Seattle service came to an end in 1939, replaced by inexpensive automobiles running on the recently developed highway system. Rails on city streets were paved over or removed, and the opening of the Seattle trolleybus system brought the end of streetcars in Seattle in 1941. This left an extensive network of privately owned buses (later public) as the only mass transit within the city and throughout the region.|$|E

25|$|Reasons for {{the decline}} of the Kew railway line are varied. A {{commonly}} held idea is that tramway competition led to a loss of passengers. The remoteness of the Kew railway station compared to the tramway which ran along High Street was almost certainly a factor. In his book Marc Fiddian states 'the abolition of through trains to Kew was probably <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> of the branch line'.|$|E
25|$|To {{combat the}} Great Northern, {{in a few}} {{instances}} Villard built branch line mileage simply to occupy a territory, {{regardless of whether the}} territory offered the railroad any business. Mismanagement, sparse traffic, and the Panic of 1893 sounded <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> for the Northern Pacific and Villard's interest in railroading. The company slipped into its second bankruptcy on October 20, 1893. Oakes was named receiver and Brayton Ives, {{a former chairman of the}} New York Stock Exchange, became president.|$|E

50|$|Although The Count hung up his cape in 1975 {{as far as}} Nightmare Theatre was concerned, {{the program}} {{continued}} for several more years without his presence. (Like his early-morning compatriot J.P. Patches, The Count had become a local celebrity and pop-culture icon.) His retirement—and the fact that horror cinema had lost favor with an audience now more interested in modern science fiction fare like Star Wars—spelled <b>the</b> inevitable <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> of Nightmare Theatre. Towey returned in full regalia for a one-off televised Halloween special in 1978, which also marked the official end of Nightmare Theatre.|$|R
50|$|As in Australia, though {{six years}} later, Mitsubishis from Japan sounded <b>the</b> Hunter's <b>death</b> <b>knell.</b> After {{beginning}} with CKD assembly {{of a single}} Galant coupé model in 1972, Todds had added the Lancer saloon in 1975 and launched its first mid-size Mitsubishi Galant Sigma saloon line in 1977, effectively replacing the Hunter. The far more modern, better equipped Mitsubishis were pricier, and the Hunter still had its fans and lingered on until 1979, when it was discontinued in the UK and Todd's built the last Chrysler-badged version anywhere.|$|R
25|$|The Police Act of 1919 was <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> of NUPPO. It {{established}} the Police Federation, a public sector {{version of a}} company union, to replace NUPPO. Under the Act, NUPPO was outlawed as a representative body for the police and forbade them from belonging to a trade union. NUPPO had no options but to fight or fold; unsurprisingly, it chose to fight. This time, however, it was the union that misread {{the mood of the}} men when it called for another strike. Out of a force of 18,200 men in the Metropolitan Police, only 1,156 participated in the strike in 1919.|$|E
25|$|Apple {{farming in}} the area started to decline about the time Ihmsen Ranch fruit {{production}} was at its prime. Water rates shot up with a switch to electric pumps. World War I took owners and workers away with the draft. During the Great Depression many families left the mostly agricultural area looking for work. Washington and British Columbia apple growers were able to cut prices because they shipped their produce by river transportation, whereas Apple Valley apples were transported by rail or by truck. <b>The</b> <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> {{was a series of}} outbreaks of a virulent fungus infections coupled with frost, heat and hail in 1944, 1945 and 1946.|$|E
25|$|With {{the death}} of Lorenzo de' Medici in 1492 was marked {{the decline of the}} League, he having been one of its {{greatest}} supporters and prime maintainer, recognising the advantage of maintaining a balance among the five powers as opposed to trying to eliminate his enemies. Whilst the League failed to prevent the French invasion in 1494 the began the Italian Wars, it did enable (as the League of Venice) the creation of the army that repelled Charles VIII's army after their sack of Naples. The League army engaged the French at Fornovo and retained control of the battlefield but failed to prevent an orderly French retreat. The Venetian alliance with France and Spain against Milan and Naples in the Italian War of 1499–1504, however, sounded <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> for the League.|$|E
50|$|The {{term loan}} assumed from SMART as a {{consequence}} of the merger agreement ultimately proved to be <b>the</b> company’s <b>death</b> <b>knell.</b> Continued losses, weak demand, high administration costs and consultant departures, resulted in the forced liquidation of the merged entity so as to satisfy interest and principal obligations due March 31, 2011. Practices were rapidly sold off to meet the deadline as no alternate sources of refinance materialized with the company announcing there would be no proceeds for common stockholders as it winds-down its business. On April 5, 2011, Steve Samek announced his resignation along with that of CFO Warren D. Barratt.|$|R
25|$|In 1885 William Murphy {{purchased}} {{the land that}} contained the monument, intending to cover the pyramid with advertising. The Union Pacific Railroad Company had other plans. The company obtained a special deed to the property in 1889. The railroad company's decision to twice relocate the tracks farther south {{to take advantage of}} more gradual grades over the Laramie Mountains threatened Sherman's tenuous existence a few hundred yards west of the monument. <b>The</b> town's <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> came in 1918.

25|$|Michael Banach, {{the current}} Vatican {{representative}} to the International Atomic Energy Agency, told a conference in Vienna in September 2011 that the Japanese nuclear disaster created new concerns {{about the safety of}} nuclear plants globally. Auxiliary bishop of Osaka Michael Goro Matsuura said this serious nuclear power incident should be a lesson for Japan and other countries to abandon nuclear projects. He called on the worldwide Christian solidarity to provide wide support for this anti-nuclear campaign. Statements from bishops’ conferences in Korea and the Philippines called on their governments to abandon atomic power.

25|$|The {{establishment}} of the new Republic of Zimbabwe in 1980 sounded <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> for white political power and ushered {{in a new era}} of black majority rule. White emigration peaked between 1980 and 1982 at 53,000 persons, with the breakdown of law and order, an increase in crime in the rural areas, and the provocative attitude of Zimbabwean officials being cited as the main causes. Political conditions typically had a greater impact on the decision to migrate among white than black professionals. Between 1982 and 2000 Zimbabwe registered a net loss of 100,000 whites, or an average of 5,000 departures per year. A second wave of white emigration was sparked by President Robert Mugabe's violent land reform programme after 2000. Popular destinations included South Africa and Australia, which emigrants perceived to be geographically, culturally, or sociopolitically similar to their home country.|$|E
25|$|Passenger traffic {{began to}} drop {{following}} the Second World War as bus services became more popular; the East Kent Road Car Company ran buses which passed close to Smeeth {{on their way}} between Ashford and Folkestone, drawing off much of the railway's custom. Nationalisation in 1947 saw the Southern Region of British Railways (BR) take over responsibility for the station, and it began to implement a new policy of centring goods traffic at larger railhead depots, thereby sounding <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> for many wayside stations across the country whose income was largely down to goods traffic. In 1953, BR proposed the closure of Smeeth Station, arguing that it would save nearly £10,000 in wages and other expenses linked with the renewal of the two platforms; the station, it said, brought in £10,322 in goods receipts and only £143 would be lost from withdrawing passenger services. The local Member of Parliament, Bill Deedes, encouraged villagers to fight the closure, but the local newspaper noted that most preferred to travel by bus or motor car. The station's last passenger train therefore departed at 9.50pm on Sunday 3 January 1954, leaving goods traffic to last for ten more years before Smeeth closed entirely.|$|E
50|$|Hormonal root pruning theory - in the {{new theory}} just like ethylene, GA, BA and Eth are seen both to be induced by sugar (GA/BA) and oxygen (ETH) {{shortages}} (as well as maybe excess levels of carbon dioxide for Eth) in the roots, and to push sugar and oxygen, as well as minerals, water and the growth hormones out of the root cell causing a positive feedback loop resulting <b>the</b> emptying and <b>death</b> of <b>the</b> root cell. <b>The</b> final <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> for a root might be strigolactone or most probably ABA as these are indicators of substances that should be abundant in the root and if they can't even support themselves with these nutrients then they should be senesced.|$|R
50|$|A major {{reduction}} {{in the cost of}} lighting occurred with the discovery of whale oil. The use of whale oil declined after Abraham Gesner, a Canadian geologist, first refined kerosene in the 1840s, allowing brighter light to be produced at substantially lower cost. In the 1850s, the price of whale oil dramatically increased (more than doubling from 1848 to 1856) due to shortages of available whales, hastening whale oil's decline. By 1860, there were 33 kerosene plants in the United States, and Americans spent more on gas and kerosene than on whale oil. <b>The</b> final <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> for whale oil was in 1859, when crude oil was discovered and the petroleum industry arose.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>death</b> of <b>Knell</b> has {{provided}} a convenient explanation for how Shakespeare came into the acting profession. As Samuel Schoenbaum puts it, [...] "When the Queen's Men stopped in Stratford in 1587, they were short a man, William Knell having been lately killed in a brawl with a fellow actor. Maybe Shakespeare took Knell's place and thus found his way to London and stage-land." [...] Shakespeare's father, John Shakespeare, as High Bailiff of Stratford, {{was responsible for the}} acceptance and welfare of visiting theatrical troupes. However there is no direct evidence of Shakespeare's membership of the Queen's Men, so it remains speculation.|$|R
