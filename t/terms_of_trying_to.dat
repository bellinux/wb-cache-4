50|$|There are correspondences between certain {{divisions}} {{and the presence}} or absence of medial glides in later dialects, in ways that differ depending on the class of the initial (e.g. velar, labial, retroflex, etc.). There are also clear co-occurrence restrictions between initials and divisions, in that initials from certain of these same classes can occur with finals only from certain divisions. The LMC authors of this system appear to have been aware of these classes of initials, and seem to have determined the separation into divisions partly on the basis of the co-occurrence relationships and partly on the medial glides, although it is debated how the exact classification was made. It is important to remember that the authors of this system were attempting to use LMC phonology to reconstruct EMC phonology (although they probably thought of it more in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> harmonize the way that words were normally pronounced with the rather different system of rhymes and homophones as laid out in the Qieyun).|$|E

40|$|Identity of a {{language}} learner has recently achieved an importance of its own in academic considerations regarding the nature of language and its learning. The success of the notion {{in the field of}} language education has been triggered by poststructural or postmodern achievements in language studies on the one hand, and constructive or constructionist approaches to human learning on the other. Additionally, critical socio-cultural studies, such as the ecological approach, “assassinated” the native speaker envisaging the agency of the learner in process of personal meaning making. Concurrent language pedagogy, subsumed under the umbrella <b>term</b> <b>of</b> autonomy, <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> meet the linguistics and psychological advances, yet, as we <b>try</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate it in the present article, students find it difficult to assume new identities for themselves as legitimate users of a foreign language. A discursive analysis of an interview with students completing a semester-long sojourn in a multilingual and multicultural milieu allows us to pursue their identities pertaining to the roles of {{a language}} learner and user. Discourse as a method helps us define the normative pedagogical discourse as a dominating ideological construct positioning students’ linguistic identities and exhibiting underlying language awareness...|$|R

500|$|In {{the context}} of {{increasing}} Venetian and Genoese power in the eastern Mediterranean, association with Hellenism took deeper root among the Byzantine elite, on account {{of a desire to}} distinguish themselves from the Latin West and to lay legitimate claims to Greek-speaking lands. Beginning in the twelfth century and especially after 1204, certain Byzantine Greek intellectuals began to use the ancient Greek ethnonym Héllēn (Greek: [...] ) in order to describe Byzantine civilisation. After the fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders in 1204, a small circle of the elite of the Empire of Nicaea used the term Hellene as a <b>term</b> <b>of</b> self-identification. For example, in a letter to Pope Gregory IX, the Byzantine emperor John Vatatzes (r. 1221–1254) claimed to have received the gift of royalty from Constantine the Great, and put emphasis on his [...] "Hellenic" [...] descent, exalting the wisdom of the Greek people. He was presenting Hellenic culture {{as an integral part of}} the Byzantine polity in defiance of Latin claims. Emperor Theodore II Laskaris (r. 1254-1258), the only one during this period to systematically employ the term Hellene as a <b>term</b> <b>of</b> self-identification, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> revive Hellenic tradition by fostering the study of philosophy, for in his opinion there was a danger that philosophy [...] "might abandon the Greeks and seek refuge among the Latins". For historians of the court of Nikaia, however, such as George Akropolites and George Pachymeres, Rhomaios remained the only significant <b>term</b> <b>of</b> self-identification, despite traces of influence of the policy of the Emperors of Nikaia in their writings.|$|R

40|$|That the {{compositing}} {{of camera}} and mobile phone {{has proven to}} be highly popular {{should come as no surprise}} to anyone interested in both the history of mobility and the history of photography. [1] As media archaeologist Errki Huhtamo recently asserted, the first mobile medium proper was amateur photography (Huhtamo, website, 2004). An examination of the correspondences between the reception and promotion of early amateur photography and the current fascination with (and revulsion of) mobile camera phone practices is instructive in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> understand our contemporary moment. In particular, the long association between amateur or snapshot photography and the family appears to be rapidly extending itself to the mobile camera phone. Camera phone marketing is awash with images of children, pets, family events and ritualised personal experiences. This raises a couple of interesting questions that this paper will seek to address. Firstly, what impact will camera phone imaging have, if any, on the existing practices of capturing, collecting and the distribution of family photographs? And secondly, how does the promotion of the family as a legitimate subject for mobile camera photography play out against the increasingly hysterical response to the use of mobile camera phones in public spaces...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Smoking {{and passive}} smoking shows a strong {{correlation}} with highly increased risk for lung cancer. 87 percent of lung cancer deaths are due to smoking. Cancer diagnosis is a strong motivation of smoking cessation for patients. Our aim is the clinical significance of smoking cessation after cancer diagnosis and smokers characteristics that influence positively or negatively the success of smoking cessation. Material and Methods 1020 smokers were examined, 83 {{with a history of}} cancer and 937 without cancer. They attended a 12 weeks program with counselling and first line medical treatment of smoking cessation. Exhaled carbon monoxide measured in every visit. Determination of dependence on nicotine, the level of mobilization in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> quit smoking and deprivation during the quit attempt evaluated. Results The Continuous Abstinence Rate (CAR) among cancer patients was 55. 47 % and in non-cancer patients was 67. 02 %. Sex and educational level did not affect the success of cessation. However, in cancer smokers found that the existence of severe dependence, contrary to the general population, does not affect smoking cessation. Conclusions Smoking cessation in patients with cancer is accompanied by significant success, although this outcome is poorer compared with non-cancer smokers. Cancer patients must follow well-organized smoking cessation programs as soon as diagnosis is made, {{in order to have a}} successful and prolong smoking cessation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the debate on consistency in HRM offering a view that contrasts with the received approach which frames the issue in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> implementation variability, slippages and resistance. Building on {{the result of a}} qualitative study in a large retail chain, we argue that consistency stems from a set of specific practices that we describe as text work, connection work and upkeep work. We suggest in particular that consistency is achieved through a dynamic process between center (HR department) and periphery (business units), in which the center monitors local situations and HRM activities and <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> govern them at a distance through text and talk, only for the periphery to produce further variation {{as the result of the}} attempt to domesticate the messiness of local situations. We argue that reframing the issue <b>of</b> consistency in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> practices which <b>try</b> <b>to</b> give regularity and consistency to what is inherently heterogeneous and local –rather than the more or less accurate implementation of an ideal design– has profound implications both for practice and future research...|$|R
40|$|First paragraph: In {{her very}} generous review {{of my book}} Beyond Learning, Megan Laverty raises some important, {{and in a sense}} {{fundamental}} points about the ideas put forward in the book. I find Laverty's review generous because, in hindsight, I feel that I could have knitted together the ideas presented in the book more tightly than I have managed to do.
