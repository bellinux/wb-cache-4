5|$|The Battle of Bardia {{brought to}} the fore the {{simmering}} hostility between regular officers and reservists. Frank Berryman, the 6th Division's General Staff Officer (Grade 1), and Alan Vasey, the Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General (DA), were eager for Robertson to do well and show that Staff Corps officers could make good commanders, and if <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> {{at the expense of}} an old-style reservist like Stanley Savige, so much the better. They pushed for Robertson's 19th Infantry Brigade, then in reserve, to be committed when the attack by Savige's 17th Infantry Brigade slowed down. The abrupt manner in which this was done generated antipathy between Robertson and Savige.|$|E
5|$|After {{reading the}} report, an outraged Hermann Göring demanded 'at the highest level' the {{transfer}} of the airmen to Luftwaffe control. Unknown to all airmen except Lamason, their execution had been scheduled for 26 October, if they remained at Buchenwald. News of the airmen's scheduled execution had been conveyed to Lamason by a German political prisoner, Eugen Kogon, who had a reliable contact within the camp administrative area. Lamason discussed the information at length with Yeo-Thomas, Burney and Robert and they concluded there was little <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to avert the mass execution. Lamason decided not to inform the airmen, but to keep this information to himself to keep morale high and in the slight hope the Luftwaffe would intervene in time. On the night of 19 October, seven days before their scheduled execution, 156 of the 168 airmen, including Lamason, were transferred from Buchenwald to Stalag Luft III by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the best}} interdiction efforts of Rolling Thunder, however, the NLF and PAVN {{launched}} their largest offensive thus {{far in the}} war on 30 January 1968, striking throughout South Vietnam during the lunar new year holiday. The Tet Offensive concluded as a military disaster for North Vietnam and its NLF allies, but it also adversely affected U.S. public opinion, which in turn affected the will of Washington. Fortunately for North Vietnam, many U.S. bombing advocates (including Air Force Chief of Staff McConnell) did not want to risk the one aircraft capable of delivering a lot of bombs in bad weather – the B-52. Without them, there was little <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> over the north in response to Tet, since bad weather minimized fighter operations until the beginning of April.|$|E

5|$|Having {{lost all}} of its Bristol Blenheim night fighters in the raid of 16 August, Tangmere {{dispatched}} two Hurricanes from the Fighter Interception Unit (FIU) fitted with FIU airborne radar to test the device in action. RAF Coastal Command also joined in, and committed No. 235 Squadron RAF and its Bristol Blenheims. The defence was reliant on the 68 Spitfires and Hurricanes. The numerical standing meant a ratio of one RAF fighter to every four German fighters and bombers, or in other words, one British aircraft to every two German fighters. Even had the fighter controllers realised {{the strength of the}} raid, there was little <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> Other fighters were refuelling and rearming after the attacks on Kenley and Biggin Hill and would not be available.|$|E
5|$|The Hollywood Reporter ran {{a front-page}} story on January 13 that Hearst papers were about to run a series of editorials attacking Hollywood's {{practice}} of hiring refugees and immigrants for jobs <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by Americans. The goal was {{to put pressure on}} the other studios to force RKO to shelve Kane. Many of those immigrants had fled Europe after the rise of fascism and feared losing the safe haven of the United States. Soon afterwards, Schaefer was approached by Nicholas Schenck, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's parent company, with an offer on the behalf of Louis B. Mayer and other Hollywood executives to RKO Pictures of $805,000 to destroy all prints of the film and burn the negative. Once RKO's legal team reassured Schaefer, the studio announced on January 21 that Kane would be released as scheduled, and with one of the largest promotional campaigns in the studio's history. Schaefer brought Welles to New York City for a private screening of the film with the New York corporate heads of the studios and their lawyers. There was no objection to its release provided that certain changes, including the removal or softening of specific references that might offend Hearst, were made. Welles agreed and cut the running time from 122 minutes to 119 minutes. The cuts satisfied the corporate lawyers.|$|E

25|$|Air-sea rescue {{by flying}} boat or {{floatplane}} was a method used by various nations before World War II {{to pick up}} aviators or sailors who were struggling in the water. Training and weather accidents could require an aircrew to be pulled from the water, and seaplanes were occasionally used for that purpose. The limitation was that if the water's surface were too rough, the aircraft {{would not be able}} to land. The most <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> was to drop emergency supplies to the survivors.|$|E
25|$|On 3 March 2010, in Orlando, Florida, {{the eight}} {{members of the}} House of Bishops of the Anglican Church in America voted {{unanimously}} {{to become part of}} the Catholic Church along with 3,000 fellow communicants in 120 parishes in four dioceses across the country. Following the vote, the bishops and the Pastoral Provision parishes sent a joint petition to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith requesting the establishment of an ordinariate in the United States and making some suggestions about how <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{merger with}} JNU was {{opposed by the}} staff and {{scholars}} of the School since it was seen to imposed on the school by the government.

They drove all night from New York to Boston, with police escorts provided to their convoy in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. When they arrived, the child was still unconscious and the doctors said all <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> was wait to see if she woke up. The little girl never regained consciousness, and succumbed to her injuries.|$|E
25|$|On 7 June 2013, British lawmakers {{concluded}} that BT {{should never have}} allowed the Chinese company access to the UK's critical communications network without ministerial oversight, saying they were 'deeply shocked' that BT did not inform government that they were allowing Huawei and ZTE, both foreign entities with ties to the Chinese military, unfettered access to critical national systems. Furthermore, ministers discovered that the agency with the responsibility to ensure Chinese equipment and code was threat-free was entirely staffed by Huawei employees. Subsequently, parliamentarians confirmed that {{in case of an}} attack on the UK there was nothing at this point <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to stop Chinese infiltration attacking critical national infrastructure.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} bombers {{had a slight}} {{performance}} advantage over fighters due to having multiple engines and streamlined, but heavy, cantilever wing designs, so a successful interception would require careful planning to bring interceptor aircraft into a suitable defensive position {{in front of the}} bombers. Before World War II and the invention of radar, detection systems were visual or auditory, which gave only a few minutes' warning. Against World War I designs these systems were marginally useful, but against 1930s aircraft flying at twice their speed or more, they did not provide enough time to arrange interception missions. This balance of force meant that bombs would be falling before the fighters were in position and there was little <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> about it. For Britain, the answer was to concentrate on bomber production, primarily as a deterrent force.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{in an effort}} to boost Downtown and upgrade the city's western entrance, Federal and state Urban Cultural Park grants were used on Mill Street, a small brick-paved street between State and Church streets. Two {{restaurants}} opened with great success but later folded during Downtown's continued decline. The project was a failure and was home to abandoned concrete kiosks, planters, and benches all disgraced by graffiti as of 2006. Another failed attempt at urban renewal was the $11 million Canal Square shopping plaza next to Proctor's Theatre in the 1980s. This was praised by then-President of the United States Ronald Reagan {{as an example of the}} good <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by the smart use of urban renewal money. The shopping plaza, however, failed due to suburban competition. Another proposal that never got off the ground was to level Proctor's for a shopping mall.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1954 Conacher was in Ottawa {{attending}} to his parliamentary duties {{when he was asked}} to play in the annual softball game between MPs and members of the parliamentary press gallery. On May 26, in the sixth inning, in his last at-bat-ever, he hit a long drive into left field, stretching a single into a triple, when he sprinted to third base. He stood, breathing heavily and then collapsed face-first from having been hit {{in the head with a}} pitch in an earlier inning. One of the other MPs was a doctor who tried to assist him, but there was little <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> for Conacher and within twenty minutes he was pronounced dead. The next day Conacher was supposed to attend his daughter's graduation from the University of Toronto. A big funeral was held, and his brother Charlie flew in from England to be there. He was buried at St. Johns York Mills Anglican Church Cemetery in Toronto.|$|E
