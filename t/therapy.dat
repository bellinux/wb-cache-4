5|$|As {{attachment}} theory {{offers a}} broad, far-reaching {{view of human}} functioning, it can enrich a therapist's understanding of patients and the therapeutic relationship rather than dictate a particular form of treatment. Some forms of psychoanalysis-based <b>therapy</b> for adults—within relational psychoanalysis and other approaches—also incorporate attachment theory and patterns. In {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, key concepts of attachment were incorporated into existing models of behavioural couple <b>therapy,</b> multidimensional family <b>therapy</b> and couple and family <b>therapy.</b> Specifically attachment-centred interventions have been developed, such as attachment-based family <b>therapy</b> and emotionally focused <b>therapy.</b>|$|E

40|$|Although “less intense” <b>therapies</b> {{are finding}} more use in AML, the {{principal}} problem in AML remains lack of efficacy rather than toxicity. Hence less intense <b>therapies</b> are {{of little use}} {{if they are not}} more effective as well as less toxic than standard <b>therapies</b> [...] Assignment of patients to less intense <b>therapies</b> should be based on other factors in addition to age. Azacitidine and decitabine, the most commonly used less intense <b>therapies</b> in AML very probably produce better OS than best “supportive care” or “low-dose” ara-C. However improvement is relatively small when compared to expected life expectancy in the absence of disease. Accordingly, while azacitidine or decitabine should be considered the standards against which newer <b>therapies</b> are compared, continued investigation of potentially more effective <b>therapies</b> needs to continue.

Supportive psychotherapy has received little or no formal scientific study, but some clinicians find it useful in helping mildly impaired people adjust to their illness. Reminiscence <b>therapy</b> (RT) involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group, many times with the aid of photographs, household items, music and sound recordings, or other familiar items from the past. Although there are few quality studies on the effectiveness of RT, it may be beneficial for cognition and mood. Simulated presence <b>therapy</b> (SPT) is based on attachment theories and involves playing a recording with voices of the closest relatives of the person with Alzheimer's disease. There is partial evidence indicating that SPT may reduce challenging behaviours.|$|E

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually considered if induction chemotherapy fails or after a person relapses, although transplantation is also sometimes used as front-line <b>therapy</b> for people with high-risk disease.
