500|$|Stephanolepis cirrhifer, {{commonly}} known as the <b>thread-sail</b> <b>filefish,</b> is a species of marine fish in the family Monacanthidae.

Other common names for the fish include [...] "Kawahagi" [...] "カワハギ" [...] "皮剥" [...] (Japanese) and [...] "Jwi-chi" [...] (Korean). The fish grows to a maximum length of about , and consumes both plant material and small marine organisms like skeleton shrimp. S.cirrhifer is host of the parasite Peniculus minuticaudae. Some minor genetic differentiation between S.cirrhifer born in the wild and those bred in a hatchery for consumer use has been shown. The fish is edible and sold commercially for culinary purposes in many Asian countries.|$|E

40|$|Genetic diversities, {{population}} genetic {{structures and}} demographic {{histories of the}} <b>thread-sail</b> <b>filefish</b> Stephanolepis cirrhifer were investigated by nucleotide sequencing of 336 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region in 111 individuals collected from six populations in Korean coastal waters. A total of 70 haplotypes were defined by 58 variable nucleotide sites. The neighbor-joining tree of the 70 haplotypes was shallow and did not provide evidence of geographical associations. Expansion of S. cirrhifer populations began approximate 51, 000 to 102, 000 years before present, correlating with the period of sea level rise since the late Pleistocene glacial maximum. High levels of haplotype diversities (0. 974 ± 0. 029 to 1. 000 ± 0. 076) and nucleotide diversities (0. 014 to 0. 019), {{and low levels of}} genetic differentiation among populations inferred from pairwise population FST values (− 0. 007 to 0. 107), support an expansion of the S. cirrhifer population. Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed weak but significant genetic structures among three groups (FCT = 0. 028, p< 0. 05), and no genetic variation within groups (0. 53 %; FSC = 0. 005, p = 0. 23). These results may help establish appropriate fishery management strategies for stocks of S. cirrhifer and related species...|$|E
40|$|Lactococcus garvieae is {{recognized}} as a crucial bacterial pathogen of freshwater and marine fish species. It has been divided into two serological phenotypes, namely KG− and KG+. Difference of the two phenotypes is owing to {{the presence or absence}} of polysaccharide capsule, and a phenotypic change from KG− to KG+ occurs during stocking of isolates for a long period or by repeated subculturing. We found that the phenotypic change occurred more readily in L. garvieae isolates from cultured filefish, <b>thread-sail</b> <b>filefish</b> Stephanolepis cirrhifer and black scraper Thamnaconus modestus, than those from other fish species. Thus we studied the gene cluster for capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis (capsule gene cluster) of a filefish isolate, strain BSLG 13015, and revealed that the strain possessed the same capsule gene cluster as those from other fish species, but that it was integrated in a newly identified plasmid. The plasmid, a size of 31, 654 bp and circular, was named pBSLG 13015. It was detected in all of KG− filefish isolates but not in KG+ filefish isolates or L. garvieae from other fish species. It is highly probable that the easier change from KG− to KG+ in L. garvieae filefish isolates is attributed to the loss of the plasmid...|$|E
