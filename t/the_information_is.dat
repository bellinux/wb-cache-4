5|$|The {{material}} {{gathered at}} the compound was stored at the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, where forensic experts analyzed fingerprints, DNA and other trace evidence left on the material.

5|$|Agents Phil Coulson, Melinda May, and Grant Ward break an {{undercover}} agent {{out of a}} hostile base, receiving classified S.H.I.E.L.D. Level 8 intel. Trainee Skye is frustrated when Coulson refuses to tell the team what <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>is,</b> based on their clearance level. At The Hub, a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility run by Agent Victoria Hand, it is revealed that a South Ossetian separatist group has built a weapon called the Overkill device, which uses sonic vibrations to trigger other weapons from great distances. Ward, a field specialist, and Agent Leo Fitz, a weapons technology specialist, are tasked with finding and disabling the device within 24 hours, before the separatists use it to declare independence from Russia and Georgia.|$|E
50|$|When someone {{chooses to}} reveal private {{information}} to another person, {{they are making}} that person a co-owner of <b>the</b> <b>information.</b> Co-ownership comes with rules, responsibilities, and rights which the discloser of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> and receiver of it negotiate. Examples of such rules would be: Can <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>be</b> disclosed? When can <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>be</b> disclosed? To whom can <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>be</b> disclosed? And how much of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> can <b>be</b> disclosed? <b>The</b> negotiation of these rules can be complex, the rules can be explicit as well as implicit, {{and they can be}} violated.|$|R
50|$|The Judge {{dismissed}} the Applicant's appeal to set aside. The Judge cited that {{the manner in}} which <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> obtained, by hacking into the Respondents emails, and the Applicant's continued failure to describe the means by which <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> obtained meant that <b>the</b> <b>information</b> could not <b>be</b> relied upon.|$|R

Tumor type and survival duration are listed where <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>is</b> known. Blank spaces in these columns appear where precise information has not been released to the public. Medicine does not designate most long-term survivors as cured.|$|E
5|$|Thomas is also speculated to {{have been}} one of the driving forces behind the Battle of the Neva, a disputed Swedish-Novgorodian {{conflict}} that took place in 1240. The speculation is based on the 14th-century Russian Primary Chronicle mention of Finns and Tavastians fighting on the Swedish side, which according to some historians would have been organized by the bishop. However, as the Chronicle also lists the very unlikely Norwegians as allies, <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>is</b> often regarded as mid-14th century propaganda, depicting Sweden as being in control of Norway, Finland and Tavastia.|$|E
5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. In a digital signal, <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>is</b> encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of noise is called additive noise, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the widely used {{concept of an}} <b>information</b> process <b>is</b> {{analyzed}} in more detail. Especially <b>the</b> <b>information</b> process <b>is</b> related to observable variables. <b>The</b> <b>information</b> process <b>is</b> usually understood to characterize investors’ expectations about future asset prices. We show under which conditions <b>the</b> <b>information</b> process <b>is</b> governed by a geometric Brownian motion and we give a rationale for stochastic volatility of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> process. <b>The</b> <b>information</b> process <b>is</b> also analyzed for the case of learning...|$|R

25|$|In many cases, {{different}} inferential evidentials {{also indicate}} epistemic modality, such as uncertainty or probability (see epistemic modality below). For example, one evidential {{may indicate that}} <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>is</b> inferred but of uncertain validity, while another indicates that <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>is</b> inferred but unlikely to be true.|$|E

25|$|A {{basic concept}} of {{security}} management is information security. The {{primary goal of}} information security is to control access to information. The value of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>is</b> what must be protected. These values include confidentiality, integrity and availability. Inferred aspects are privacy, anonymity and verifiability.|$|E

25|$|Some {{factors that}} {{influence}} which classification information should be assigned include how much value that information has to the organization, how old <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>is</b> {{and whether or not}} the information has become obsolete. Laws and other regulatory requirements are also important considerations when classifying information.|$|E
25|$|Transfer of {{information}} between codes:With visually presented items, adults usually name and sub-vocally rehearse them, so <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>is</b> transferred from a visual to an auditory code. Articulatory suppression prevents this transfer, {{and in that}} case the above-mentioned effect of phonological similarity is erased for visually presented items.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, Al-Baghdadi's {{discovery}} did {{not gain}} much attention from his contemporaries, because <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>is</b> rather hidden within the {{detailed account of}} the geography, botany, monuments of Egypt, {{as well as of}} the famine and its consequences. He never published his anatomical observations in a separate book, as had been his intention.|$|E
50|$|Prime Minister Pašić {{received}} early <b>information</b> of <b>the</b> assassination plan. <b>The</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> {{received by}} Pašić early enough, according to Education Minister Ljuba Jovanović, {{for the government}} to order the border guards to prevent the assassins from crossing.

25|$|Photo {{manipulation}} software sometimes {{fails to}} update the embedded thumbnail after an editing operation, possibly causing the user to inadvertently publish compromising information.

25|$|Unami is, {{like many}} Algonquian languages, polysynthetic and highly agglutinative. This means {{that most of}} <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>is</b> encoded in the verb (sometimes with whole words being {{incorporated}} into the stem), making word order more fluid than in English. Unfortunately, syntax {{is one of the}} least studied aspects of the Unami language; there is much more data on morphology, because of an especial focus on reconstructing Proto-Algonquian.|$|E
25|$|Most {{autoclaves}} have {{meters and}} charts that record or display information, particularly temperature and pressure {{as a function}} of time. <b>The</b> <b>information</b> <b>is</b> checked to ensure that the conditions required for sterilization have been met. Indicator tape is often placed on packages of products prior to autoclaving, and some packaging incorporates indicators. The indicator changes color when exposed to steam, providing a visual confirmation.|$|E
50|$|Under United States law, libel {{generally}} requires five key elements: {{the plaintiff}} must prove that <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> published, <b>the</b> plaintiff was {{directly or indirectly}} identified, the remarks were defamatory towards the plaintiff's reputation, <b>the</b> published <b>information</b> <b>is</b> false, and that the defendant is at fault.|$|R
