5|$|Are You Experienced and its {{preceding}} singles {{were recorded}} over a five-month period from late October 1966 through early April 1967. The album {{was completed in}} sixteen recording sessions at three London locations, including De Lane Lea Studios, CBS, and Olympic. Chandler booked many of the sessions at Olympic because the facility was acoustically superior and equipped with most of <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>technology,</b> though it was still using four-track recorders, whereas American studios were using eight-track.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War in 1861 between {{the northern and southern}} states also contributed to the trend. The war disrupted the sale of northern ice to the south, and Maine merchants instead turned to supplying the Union Army, whose forces used ice in their more southern campaigns. James L. Cheeseman had responded to the 1860 ice famine by moving his ice trading business from the Hudson northwards into Maine, bringing with him <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>technology</b> and techniques; Cheeseman went on to win valuable contracts with the Union Army during the war years. Carré ice machines were brought into New Orleans to make up the shortfall in the south, focusing in particular on supplying southern hospitals. In the post-war years, the number of such plants increased, but once competition from the north recommenced, cheaper natural ice initially made it hard for the manufacturers to make a profit. By the late 1870s, however, efficiency improvements were allowing them to squeeze natural ice out of the marketplace in the south.|$|E
5|$|The US {{command in}} Saigon {{initially}} believed that combat operations around KSCB during 1967 {{were part of}} a series of minor North Vietnamese offensives in the border regions. That appraisal was later altered when it was discovered that the NVA was moving major forces into the area. In response, US forces were built up before the NVA isolated the Marine base. Once the base came under siege a series of actions were fought over a period of five months. During this time, KSCB and the hilltop outposts around it were subjected to constant North Vietnamese artillery, mortar, and rocket attacks, and several infantry assaults. To support the Marine base, a massive aerial bombardment campaign (Operation Niagara) was launched by the United States Air Force. Over 100,000 tons of bombs were dropped by US aircraft and over 158,000 artillery rounds were fired in defense of the base. Throughout the campaign, US forces used <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>technology</b> to locate NVA forces for targeting. Additionally, the logistical effort required to support the base once it was isolated demanded the implementation of other tactical innovations to keep the Marines supplied.|$|E

However, the intervention also posed the risk of escalating into a world war for which Hitler was not ready.

25|$|The flyby was {{the center}} of a four-month {{intensive}} observation campaign lasting from January to June. Being an ever-changing scientific target, Jupiter has been observed intermittently {{since the end of the}} Galileo mission in September 2003. Knowledge about Jupiter benefited from the fact that New Horizons instruments were built using <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>technology,</b> especially in the area of cameras, representing a significant improvement over Galileo cameras, which were modified versions of Voyager cameras, which, in turn, were modified Mariner cameras. The Jupiter encounter also served as a shakedown and dress rehearsal for the Pluto encounter. Because Jupiter is much closer to Earth than Pluto, the communications link can transmit multiple loadings of the memory buffer; thus the mission returned more data from the Jovian system than it was expected to transmit from Pluto.|$|E
25|$|After World War II ended, Communism {{took control}} of Hungary and the winery shrank to only four {{employees}} and {{the scope of the}} business was limited to selling what wine remained in stock.
