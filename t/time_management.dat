25|$|There is a {{complicated}} relationship between prospective memory and <b>time</b> <b>management</b> skills which include making lists, scheduling activities, and avoiding interruptions. Studies have not identified distinct cause and effect relationships between prospective memory and <b>time</b> <b>management,</b> but many consistent correlations have been observed. For example, people who reported better prospective memory according to the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) also indicated a higher likelihood of setting goals and priorities and being more organized. There may be a cyclical effect between prospective memory and time management: better memory may lead to better organization, and better organization may further lead to better memory.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To provide {{clinical}} practitioners with {{a framework}} for teaching patients <b>Time</b> Pressure <b>Management,</b> a cognitive strategy that aims to reduce disabilities arising from mental slowness due to acquired brain injury. <b>Time</b> Pressure <b>Management</b> provides patients with compensatory strategies to deal with time pressure in daily life. Application of the training in clinical practice is illustrated using two case examples from a randomized controlled trial {{on the effectiveness of}} <b>Time</b> Pressure <b>Management</b> for patients with stroke. Rationale: The <b>Time</b> Pressure <b>Management</b> approach is based on Michonâs task analysis, describing levels of decision-making in complex cognitive tasks. Decisions with little or no time pressure are not impaired by mental slowness. Therefore, patients should try to transfer actions from situations with high time pressure to situations where the preserved decision levels with little or no time pressure can work. Theory into practice: Several factors are required to teach patients to use <b>Time</b> Pressure <b>Management.</b> First, sufficient awareness is needed to recognize that there is a deficit and behavioural change is necessary. Sufficient awareness is also required to recognize and anticipate time pressure situations and to realize that the strategy is helpful and might also be useful in new and more difficult circumstances. Second, adequate motivation is needed to learn the strategy. And finally, the training should be adjusted to the patientâs individual learning abilities and cognitive skills...|$|R
