40|$|Background: The University Medical Center Groningen is a level I trauma {{center in}} the {{northern}} part of the Netherlands. Sixty-three percent of all the patients admitted at the Trauma Nursing Department (TND) are acute patients who are admitted directly after trauma. In 2006 and 2007, the University Medical Center Groningen was not always capable of admitting all trauma patients to the TND due to the relatively high-bed occupation. Therefore, the reduction of the average length of stay (LOS) formed the objective of the project described in this study. Methods: We used the process-focused method of Lean Six Sigma to reduce hospital stay by improving <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>procedure</b> of patients in the care processes and eliminating waste and waiting time. We used the "Dutch Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol" to identify the possible causes of inappropriate hospital stay. The average LOS of trauma patients at the TND at the beginning of the project was 10. 4 days. Results: Thirty percent of the LOS was unnecessary. The main causes of the inappropriate hospital stay were delays in several areas. The implementation of the improvement plan reduced almost 50 % of the inappropriate hospital stay, enabling the trauma center to admit almost all trauma patients to the TND. After the implementation of the improvements, the average LOS was 8. 5 days. Conclusion: Our study shows that Lean Six Sigma is an effective method to reduce inappropriate hospital stay, thereby improving the quality and financial efficiency of trauma care...|$|E

Better understanding of patient and process factors related to preventable readmissions would enable us to improve <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>procedure</b> and reorganize care pathways to prevent these readmissions. Aim and research question: To find patient-, process-, and medication-related factors which lead to unplanned hospital readmissions. The research question of this study was: Which patient-, process- and medication-related factors are associated with unplanned hospital readmission in patients 18 years and older discharge from a general internal medicine ward? Method: A case control study is done with 35 cases and 35 controls. Using a self made case report form all the medical records a searched. Also earlier collected prospective data is included in this study. The included factors are divided in three levels. Patient-, process- and medication-related factors. Results: From the patient-related factors only chronic illness is a factor who can be associated with hospital readmissions. From the process-related factors mean length of stay in days, wanted to receive care after discharge and timely informed about discharge are significantly proven. The factors medication change and use prednisone are from the medication-related level and can be associated with unplanned hospital readmission. Conclusion: There are a lot factors investigated, but only a couple of them are significantly different. Normally it is common to include more controls against the cases into such a ratio of 1 : 3. Recommendations: It is a recommendation to extend this study with more controls and more depth in some factors. Now, it is still too wide examine.

40|$|In The Netherlands, many stroke {{patients}} stay in {{the hospital}} for some time merely waiting for discharge placement. This indicates an inefficient use of hospital resources, as well as a possible deficiency in the quality of care, because hospitals are not adequately equipped to care for these patients. In this study, we tried to quantify this "waiting problem. " Six hospitals and 29 neurologists participated in this prospective study. The neurologists were asked during weekly interviews to specify for 154 patients the reason for retention in the hospital on a day-to-day basis. The reasons were noted on a list specified by the authors in advance. The mean length of hospital stay was 28 days. On average, there were "hard" medical reasons for 15 days (54 %) and "soft" medical reasons for 3 days (10 %), whereas the remaining 10 days (36 %) were explained by nonmedical reasons (most frequently, waiting for placement in a nursing home). The length of hospital stay for stroke patients in The Netherlands can be reduced considerably without compromising the quality of care. This might be realized by increasing the capacity of long-term care facilities, improving the efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>procedures,</b> or creating "stroke services. ...|$|R

40|$|After Yogyakarta {{earthquake}} in 2006, {{the main problem}} {{that occurred in the}} first yard of Prambanan Temple is ponding area that occurred after rainfall. Soil characterization needs to be determined by conducting several processes, especially permeability coefficient (k) in both saturated and unsaturated conditions to solve this problem. More accurate and efficient field testing procedure is required to obtain permeability data that present the field condition. One of the field permeability test equipment is Constant <b>Discharge</b> <b>procedure</b> to determine <b>the</b> permeability coefficient. Necessary adjustments of <b>the</b> Constant <b>Discharge</b> <b>procedure</b> are needed to be determined especially the value of geometric factor (F) to improve the corresponding value of permeability coefficient. The value of k will be correlated with the value of volumetric water content (θ) of an unsaturated condition until saturated condition. The principle <b>procedure</b> of Constant <b>Discharge</b> model provides a constant flow in permeameter tube that flows into the ground until the water level in the tube becomes constant. Constant water level in the tube is highly dependent on the tube dimension. Every tube dimension has a shape factor called the geometric factor that affects the result of the test. Geometric factor value is defined as the characteristic of shape and radius of the tube. This research has modified the geometric factor parameters by using empty material tube method so that the geometric factor will change. Saturation level is monitored by using soil moisture sensor.

40|$|Discharge {{time series}} in {{rivers and streams}} are usually based on simple stage-discharge {{relations}} calibrated using a set of direct stage-discharge measurements called gaugings. Bayesian inference recently emerged as a most promising framework to build such hydrometric rating curves accurately and to estimate the associated uncertainty. In addition to providing the rigorous statistical framework necessary to uncertainty analysis, the main advantage of the Bayesian analysis of rating curves arises from the quantitative assessment of i) the hydraulic controls that govern the stage-discharge relation, and of ii) the individual uncertainties of available gaugings, which often differ according to <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> measurement <b>procedure</b> and <b>the</b> flow conditions. In this paper, we introduce the BaRatin method for the Bayesian analysis of stationary rating curves and we apply it to three typical cases of hydrometric stations with contrasted flow conditions and variable abundance of hydraulic knowledge and gauging data.

40|$|The Simoloyer-mill is {{well known}} as a horizontal-rotary-ballmill that allows high-kinetic energy impact at {{relative}} velocity of the grinding media up to 14 ms- 1. This often leads to very short processing times {{in the range of}} some seconds to some minutes for particle-size-reduction, particle-shape-deformation and reactive-milling. If the device is applied for a batch-process, these short processing times result in a major barrier for the scaling up res. the commercialization of the process. The reason is <b>the</b> needed <b>discharging</b> <b>procedure</b> that often needs similar or longer time sometimes even at similar velocity.
