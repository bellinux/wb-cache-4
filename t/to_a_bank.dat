5|$|Although the {{compromise}} passed the Senate in March 1970, it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who {{was determined to}} end silver in the coinage. The Senate passed the bill again in September, this time attaching it as a rider <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> holding company bill sought by Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half dollar and to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was approved by a conference committee and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that as Congress had adjourned, not signing the bill would pocket veto it, Nixon hastily signed it just before midnight on December 31, 1970, only minutes before the deadline.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} central London Underground stations, Holborn was modernised {{in the early}} 1930s to replace the lifts with escalators. The station frontages on Kingsway and High Holborn were {{partially}} reconstructed to modernist designs by Charles Holden with the granite elements replaced with plain Portland stone façades perforated with glazed screens. The lifts were removed and a spacious new ticket hall was provided giving access <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> of four escalators down to an intermediate concourse for the Central line platforms. A second bank of three escalators continues down to the Piccadilly line platforms.|$|E
5|$|Having {{learned the}} truth about Dexter's identity, Arthur (John Lithgow) confronts Dexter (Michael C. Hall) at the police station, where nobody else knows Arthur is the Trinity Killer. He warns Dexter to leave him alone from now on. When he leaves, Dexter follows Arthur in his car, and accidentally strikes another car on his way. Dexter follows Arthur <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank,</b> where he sees Arthur bring a large {{envelope}} back to his van. Dexter attacks Arthur, knocking him out and dragging him into the van, and Dexter realizes the envelope is filled with cash. Dexter plans to take Arthur's van away and kill Arthur, but he spots {{the driver of the}} car he struck earlier talking to police officers next to Dexter's car. Dexter hides the envelope and confronts the driver, who acts very irritable. A frustrated Dexter attacks him and is detained by the police. By the time he is released, Arthur is gone, but Dexter recovers the envelope of money.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Carl Williams, the {{superintendent}} of the New Jersey State Police, {{wrote a letter to}} Pope John Paul II asking him to raise the issue of Shakur's extradition during his talks with President Fidel Castro. During the pope's visit to Cuba in 1998, Shakur agreed to an interview with NBC journalist Ralph Penza. Shakur later published an extensive criticism of the NBC segment, which inter-spliced footage of Trooper Foerster's grieving widow with an FBI photo connected <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> robbery of which Shakur had been acquitted. On March 10, 1998 New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman asked Attorney General Janet Reno to do whatever it would take to return Shakur from Cuba. Later in 1998, U.S. media widely reported claims that the United States State Department had offered to lift the Cuban embargo in exchange for the return of 90U.S. refugees, including Shakur.|$|E

25|$|The du Temple was {{an early}} naval {{water-tube}} boiler, patented in 1876. It was invented by Félix du Temple in France and was tested in a Royal Navy torpedo gunboat. Water tubes were convoluted, arranged in four rows <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank,</b> and S-shaped with sharp right angle bends. This packed a large tube heating area into a small volume, but made tube cleaning impractical. The drums were cylindrical, with perpendicular tube entry and external downcomers between them.|$|E
25|$|The use of Hajj notes {{continued}} until 1978. Until this date, stocks of notes were used without {{the necessity of}} printing new notes with the signatures of the later Governors.

25|$|Although Bunker was {{eventually}} released, he continued {{a life of}} crime.

40|$|M. Comm. The {{principal}} {{aim of the}} present dissertation {{is to determine the}} nature of <b>an</b> electronicbanking environment, <b>to</b> determine the threats within such an environment and the security functionality needed to ward off these threats. Security solutions for each area at risk will be provided in short. The main focus of the dissertation will fall on the security protocols that can be used as solutions <b>to</b> protect <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> system. In the dissertation, indication will also be given of what the security protocols, in their turn, depend on to provide protection <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> system. There are several security protocols that can be used <b>to</b> secure <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> system. The problem, however, is to determine which protocol will provide the best security for <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> in <b>a</b> specific application. This dissertation is also aimed at providing a general security framework that banks could use to evaluate various security protocols which could be implemented <b>to</b> secure <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> system. Such framework should indicate which security protocols will provide <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> in <b>a</b> certain <b>banking</b> environment with the best protection against security threats. It should also indicate which protocols could be used in combination with others to provide the best security...|$|R

25|$|The company {{suffered}} {{financial difficulties}} in 1985, a company investigation uncovered fraud, {{culminating in the}} dismissal of company director Frank E. Peters. A British political controversy ensued, with its focus upon the fraud and the WDA's investment practices. Peters was extradited to Britain to face a criminal trial, but was acquitted of all charges. The company became bankrupt due to financial and market pressures, and its assets were later sold for £1.25 million. Peters was subject to a United States court case in 2007; the charges included conspiracy, fraudulently inflating the value of security <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank,</b> bank fraud, mail fraud and wire fraud.|$|E
25|$|The term {{private bank}} refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> that offers private banking {{services}} {{and in its}} legal form is a partnership. The first private banks were created in St. Gallen in the mid-18th century and in Geneva in the late 18th century as partnerships, and some {{are still in the}} hands of the original families such as Hottinger and Mirabaud. In Switzerland, such private banks are called private bankers (a protected term) to distinguish them from the other private banks which are typically shared corporations. Historically in Switzerland a minimum of CHF1million was required to open an account, however, over the last years many private banks have lowered their entry hurdles to CHF250,000 for private investors.|$|E
25|$|Coming to the CBI at {{the peak}} of {{political}} controversy over the Labour government's attempt to reform trade union law, Adamson held the difficult role of representing industry through the complex struggle over Edward Heath's Industrial Relations Bill.

Adamson was able to unite industry to support the British application to join the European Communities. In later life as Chairman of Abbey National, Adamson led the move to demutualise and convert it from a building society <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank,</b> and saw an overwhelming majority of the society's members support the move. Also interested in family policy, he set up the Family Policy Studies Centre.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>banking</b> {{license is}} <b>a</b> legal {{prerequisite}} for {{a financial institution}} that wants <b>to</b> carry on <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> business.

Under laws of most jurisdictions, general banking activities, such as taking deposits from the general public, are exclusive <b>to</b> holders of <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> license. <b>A</b> non-banking financial company is an institution that provides financial services without meeting the legal definition of <b>a</b> <b>bank,</b> such as holding <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> license.|$|R
25|$|Bank of America {{has formed}} a {{partnership}} with the United States Department of Defense creating a newly chartered bank DOD Community Bank ("Community Bank") providing full banking services to military personnel at 68 branches and ATM locations on U.S. military installations in Guantanamo Bay Naval Base Cuba, Diego Garcia, Germany, Japan, Italy, Kwajalein Atoll, South Korea, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. It should be noted that even though Bank of America operates Community Bank customer services are not interchangeable between the two financial institutions, meaning a Community Bank customer cannot go <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bank</b> of America branch and withdraw from their account and vice versa. Deposits made into checking and savings accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000 despite the fact that none of Community's operating branches are located within the jurisdictional borders of the United States.|$|E
25|$|Cavallo {{was called}} by President de la Rúa in March 2001 to lead the economy once again, {{in the face of}} a {{weakened}} coalition government and two years of recession. He attempted to restore business confidence by renegotiating the external debt with the International Monetary Fund and with bondholders, but the growing country risk and spiraling put options by large investors and foreign holdings led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> run and a massive capital flight. In late November 2001, Cavallo introduced a set of measures that blocked the usage of cash, informally known as the corralito ("financial corral"). The anger of those Argentines with the means to invest abroad created a framework for the popular middle-class protest termed the cacerolazo. Political pressure by the Peronist opposition and other organized economic interests coincided with the December 2001 riots. This critical situation finally forced Cavallo, and then de la Rúa, to resign.|$|E
25|$|The Land of Oz as {{portrayed in}} the classic MGM musical movie of 1939, is quite {{different}} from that portrayed in Baum's books. The most notable difference is that in the film the entire land of Oz appears to be dreamed up by Dorothy Gale (thus making it a dream world), although, Dorothy earnestly corrects the adults at the end that she was indeed there, and an image of Dorothy's falling farmhouse returning to earth is presented. The apparent message is that one should appreciate one's home, no matter how dull it may look or uninteresting its surroundings may be, for having a home and a family is not something that should be taken for granted. This contrasts sharply with the books, in which Dorothy and her family are eventually invited to move to Oz due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> foreclosure on the farm, showing both that Oz is a real place, and that it is a utopia compared to the prairies of Kansas.|$|E
