She once attended a Catholic school, {{though she was}} raised as a Buddhist. She has recalled some portions of her childhood as [...] "painful", explaining that [...] "I loved my father very much and I only got to see him during the school holidays. But I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> advantage that they split up when I was very young, so I could get used to it." [...] She visited her father in Falsterbo, Sweden, during school breaks and talked to him regularly over the phone. She cites her parents as [...] "supportive, positive influences" [...] in her life.|$|E
500|$|In the off-season, it was speculated {{by many in}} {{the media}} whether Luongo should remain Vancouver's captain, citing the added {{pressure}} of the goaltending position. After the Canucks' 3–1 series deficit in the second round, Luongo ceased to make himself available for pre-game interviews – a customary practice for goaltenders, but not for captains. When asked after the Canucks' elimination whether he thought he should remain team captain, he told reporters he did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> issue. However, Gillis, who appointed him captain two seasons prior, asserted it was a topic to be addressed in the off-season. On September 13, 2010, Luongo confirmed he was stepping down, stating that [...] "Serv as captain...in a Canadian city for a team with such passionate fans is a privilege and an experience I will always take pride in. I {{will continue to be a}} leader on this team and support my teammates the same way I always have while focusing on our ultimate goal." [...] Centre Henrik Sedin, who won the Hart Trophy for the 2009–10 season, was named Luongo's successor in a pre-game ceremony to the Canucks' season-opener.|$|E

It is going to be against commercial infrastructure". Later this fear was qualified by President Clinton after reports of actual cyber terrorist attacks in 2000: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> alarm.

2500|$|Many {{art historians}} {{suggest that the}} {{portrait}} was likely a private commission based on the print's content {{and the fact that}} it has no kiwame-in censor seal. The precise reason for the print's production is less clear, however. Some describe it as a New Year's gift from the publisher to friends, others feel it was issued to [...] "celebrate both the New Year and Nishimura Yohachi’s longevity," [...] still others <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> acknowledgement of Nishimuraya's 71st birthday. It is also possible that it was issued to memorialize the publisher having experienced hatsuyume.|$|E

She insisted that she had read the report, but was unable to recall any of the 127 recommendations. When asked if she could remember the specific recommendations, Abbott said [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> important review and we should act on it". Abbott also denied reports Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell were attempting to stop her from making broadcasts. The next day, Abbott withdrew citing illness at the last minute from a joint interview on Women's Hour on 6 June with her Conservative frontbench opposite number Amber Rudd also participating.|$|E

2500|$|Legend says in {{the early}} 16th century, the local Osage Indians were on a bear hunt, chasing two black bears along the White River until one went up a tree for safety. But a well placed arrow took it out. [...] They {{continued}} to chase the other bear up Roark Mountain, and the bear fell onto a ledge in the sinkhole. The hunting party didn't want to all jump down to kill the bear and have to drag it back up so, a brave young tribe member climbed down to the ledge with his hunting dog and knife. He stabbed the bear and the bear lunged back. The bear, dog and the boy fell through the sinkhole landing in the Cathedral Room. The Indians then looked down the hole and saw nothing. They heard strange sounds; echoing sounds of their voices, bats flying around, water trickling and they felt warm air, all of which made them <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> evil place. The Indians thought they had found the entrance to Hades and named the cave the Devil's Den. [...] They marked trees around the Devil's Den with their danger sign (a sideways V), and never returned.|$|E
