Frank Hodorowicz, another bootlegger turned government witness, testified that he had paid Kretske $1,300 to recommend the dismissal of two cases and was convicted in the third case after he refused to pay $1,000. After he was indicted the third time, he testified, Glasser declined to intervene on his behalf, saying: [...] "You're going to jail for five years; I can't do anything about it.

40|$|The Malaysian {{government}} {{introduced the}} Goods and Services Tax (GST) starting from 1 April 2015 {{to enhance the}} revenue collections and mitigate the transfer pricing manipulation. <b>Tax</b> <b>agents</b> {{play a significant role}} to help businesses to comply with GST law and regulations. After one year of GST implementation, it is vital to understand tax agents’ perceptions on clients’ compliance behaviour and tax agents’ roles in influencing compliance. A total of 30 registered <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> completed a survey questionnaire. The analysis shows that <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> devote their time to provide advice to their clients on meeting their GST requirements, and recording and reporting of GST transactions. <b>Tax</b> <b>agents</b> assert that clients pass on their GST responsibilities to <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> to some extent. <b>Tax</b> <b>agents</b> also perceive that clients’ compliance level is low because clients occasionally submit GST 03 after the deadline, compromise the accuracy of GST 03 in order to get it done on time and intentionally make errors in their records. In terms of tax agents’ role in promoting compliance, the <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> strongly agree that it is important for them to act as trusted advisors for their clients. After one year of GST implementation, this is the first study that explores tax agents’ perceptions on clients’ compliance and tax agents’ roles in promoting compliance. The findings benefit the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) in assisting <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> and the public for future compliance. Similar study should be adopted by countries that have recently implemented GST (for example, India) and it should be conducted to other GST players (i. e. taxpayers and RMCD officers) on annual basis to analyse the behavioural trends and identify weaknesses in GST administration...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>agents</b> have {{important}} roles in tax systems as both advocates for their clients and intermediaries for the tax authorities. The roles of <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> are becoming more challenging with {{the changes in the}} tax landscape, such as with the implementation of the self-assessment systems (SAS) which transfers more responsibility to taxpayers to comply with their tax obligations and who in turn, rely on <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> to comply with the tax laws. This study examined some selected factors in understanding the tax agents’ tax compliance behaviour by extending the Theory of Planned Behaviour, by including two additional factors namely, ethical sensitivity and culture. Conducted in the tax jurisdictions of Malaysia and New Zealand, this study is comparative in nature. To understand the tax compliance behaviour of <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> in this study, a mixed-method approach, combining surveys and semi-structured telephone interviews, was used. In Malaysia, the survey data were collected using a mail survey from a sample of <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> in public practice whose names were listed on the website of the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board. Online surveys were used to collect responses from a sample of members of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA) whose names were listed as public practitioners on NZICA’s website. Descriptive statistics and Partial Least Squares (PLS), a structural equation modeling (SEM) technique, were used to describe and analyze the quantitative data. Transcribing, coding, finding the relevant themes and member checking were used to analyze the qualitative data of the study. Basically, the results indicate some similarities and some differences between tax agents’ compliance behaviour in Malaysia and New Zealand. Consistent with findings from prior studies, the results suggest that attitude towards intention to comply with the tax law was the most influential factor in explaining tax agents’ compliance behaviour to tax law in Malaysia and New Zealand in both scenarios of overstating tax expenses and understating income examined in the study. This was followed by ethical sensitivity, which was measured using Rest’s (1986) Multidimensional Ethics Scale (MES), as the second influential factor in tax agents’ compliance behaviour to tax law. Mixed findings were recorded for culture which was measured using Hofstede’s (1980) National Cultural Dimensions and perceived behavioural control. No support, however, was found for subjective norms in the study. The findings from the survey were elaborated further in the interviews. The interviews with seventeen <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> in Malaysia and fourteen <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> from New Zealand provide some interesting findings. While the results of the survey indicate that attitude was found {{to be the most important}} factor in tax agents’ tax compliance behaviour, the interview findings clarified how <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> understand attitude. For instance, attitude was interpreted as not only complying with the professional code of ethics, but also, fear towards being penalized, audited and interestingly, fear towards obtaining a bad reputation among the public and peers. Overall, the findings suggest that noneconomic factors, such as attitudes and ethical sensitivity, can explain the tax compliance behaviour of <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> in the study. Some economic factors identified for example, amount of risk involved, the trade-off between costs and benefits, and the probability of being penalized, from the interviews could also potentially explain the tax compliance behaviour of the <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> in Malaysia and New Zealand who participated in the study. The findings contribute to the theoretical and practical aspects of understanding the tax compliance behaviour of <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> in two different countries. In a response to the calls for more cross-cultural research, this study reveals some similarities and differences in the tax compliance behaviour of <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> in Malaysia and New Zealand which may be helpful in improving our understanding of the ethical decision making of <b>tax</b> <b>agents.</b> The findings from the study also provide some insights into the ethical behaviour of <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> in Malaysia and New Zealand which may be useful for professional bodies and regulators...|$|R
40|$|Reforms {{and changes}} in tax laws may affect the level of {{complexity}} in the tax system and increase taxpayer compliance costs burden. In Malaysia, the introduction of Self-assessment System (SAS) imposes greater accountability in terms of computational, record keeping and filing requirements upon taxpayers. The increase in taxpayer obligations coupled with higher possibility of audit may require taxpayers to seek assistance from <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> to handle <b>tax</b> matters on their behalf. In spite of the expanding role of <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> in <b>tax</b> reporting under the SAS, very {{little research has been}} directed at examining their views and perceptions. This study, therefore, evaluates the compliance costs of corporate taxpayers from the perspective of <b>tax</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R

40|$|Extract] That all {{taxpayers have}} the right in Australia to lodge a return is a privilege. However, many find it a heavy burden and favour simplification. Professional bodies and {{individuals}} have proposed alternatives that allow for tax withheld at source to be a final tax, {{eliminating the need for}} filing a return. There are also proposals to limit the delivery of welfare through the tax system. The aim is to remove large numbers of low-income earners from the tax net. This could have implications, however, for monitoring of welfare fraud and aspects of the cash economy. In the context of the questions that are being raised at this symposium, I believe that all proposals so far put forward in Australia do retain the right of a taxpayer to file a return should the taxpayer so wish, or should it be to their advantage. The complexity of the Australian tax system means that <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> are now essential to its operation. The registration of <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> ensures taxpayer protection and there are current proposals to develop a new legislative framework to further define the role of <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> in a legislated Code of Practice. However, this has taken over ten years to develop and is still under discussion. The basic reason for the delay is that with the very close working relationship that has developed between <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> and the Australian Taxation Office comes the danger that <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> become agents more of the government than they do of their clients. Australian <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> are extremely concerned not to cross that line. However, it is a line that is becoming increasingly blurred...|$|R

40|$|Electronic filing {{is one of}} {{electronic}} services provided by Inland Revenue Board (IRB) in order to assist <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> in submitting the tax return electronically and as its initiative towards Electronic Government. It {{is a process of}} submitting tax return forms over the internet using computers and tax preparation software. The phenomenon of E-Filing of tax returns and electronic payment of tax liability started since Inland Revenue Service’s (IRS), United States of America implemented their Individual Income Tax electronic system in 1985. Among the reasons of introducing E-Filing by IRB is to assist them in determining the number of tax return by the taxpayers. This will enable IRB to update their database accordingly. Besides that, E-Filing can avoid loss of tax return during submission through mail. Furthermore, the introduction of E-Filing is hoped to help IRB in reducing the cost of printing tax return forms and processing time. This study has been conducted to explore the awareness and the usage of E-Filing among <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> and to evaluate the respondents’ opinion on the benefits and barriers of using E-Filing. <b>Tax</b> <b>agents</b> in northern region of Malaysia (Kedah, Perlis and Penang) have been chosen as sample of the study. The results showed that the overall mean score for the respondents’ opinion on the benefits of E-Filing is 43. 8 compared to the barriers of E-Filing which have overall mean score 35. 0. Majority of the respondents realize the advantages of E-Filing may outweigh the disadvantages. This suggests that E-Filing has a great potential of being accepted and used among the <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> in the future.

40|$|The {{self-assessment}} {{system has}} been implemented on companies since 2001 as to replace the former official assessment system. As such, procedural issues and compliance cost associated with the new assessment system are of significant interest to the taxpayers. This {{study was conducted in}} the year 2002 i. e. after one year the self-assessment system for companies has been put into practice. It focuses on the compliance cost in terms of the time spent by the taxpayers. In the study, time spent is used to measure the increment of compliance cost since time devoted to compliance activities is very much associated with the cost incurred. The respondents in this study are the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> in the northern region i. e. Perlis, Kedah and Penang. As this is an exploratory study, the researchers used convenience sampling, which enabled them to get fifty-six SMEs and forty-five <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> in the stated area. From the survey on the SMEs, the findings reflected that the most prominent variable is the time spent for discussion with <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> (78. 83 percent), which represented the major source of increment in compliance cost under the new system, followed by learning the new tax laws (55. 40 percent); paying taxes (50. 00 percent); record-keeping (48. 20 percent); and answering IRB queries (44. 70 percent). Meanwhile, 90. 00 percent of the <b>tax</b> <b>agents</b> suggested that there was an increase in time spent under the new system for the total hours spent in complying with the new system, learning the new tax laws, preparing tax returns, and discussion with clients.
