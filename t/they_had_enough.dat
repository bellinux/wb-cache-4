Pile originally wanted the show to cover the entire hospital, not just doctors, but also porters, car park attendants and kitchen staff. However, she eventually decided that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> material with the eight main doctors and human resources workers.|$|E
5|$|Early on 8 July, U-255 caught another {{ship from}} Convoy PQ 17, the 6,069 ton American {{merchant}} ship Olopana, loaded with 6,000 tons of explosives, gasoline, and trucks as deck cargo. A single torpedo hit the ship, blowing {{out all the}} bulkheads, and killing seven of the crew. The surviving crewmen abandoned ship on four rafts, as U-255 surfaced and fired 20 shells at the ship, which sank after 20 minutes. U-255 questioned the survivors, gave them a course to land, and asked if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> food and water before leaving. The survivors landed at Moller Bay, Novaya Zemlya, two days later.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} {{two weeks before the}} test, some 250 {{personnel}} from Los Alamos were at work at the Trinity site, and Lieutenant Bush's command had ballooned to 125 men guarding and maintaining the base camp. Another 160 men under Major T.O. Palmer were stationed outside the area with vehicles to evacuate the civilian population in the surrounding region should that prove necessary. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> vehicles to move 450 people to safety, and had food and supplies to last them for two days. Arrangements were made for Alamogordo Army Air Field to provide accommodation. Groves had warned the Governor of New Mexico, John J. Dempsey, that martial law might have to be declared in the southwestern part of the state.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{had very}} {{little in the way of}} heavy weapons, as they had {{discarded}} most of their artillery and machine guns due to lack of ammunition. Despite the chronic ammunition shortage von Lettow-Vorbeck was able to move four machine guns up close to the rifle pits, using them only at close range to ensure his ammunition would not be wasted. The inexperience of the Portuguese proved to be their downfall; despite their firing over 30,000 rounds, German casualties were extremely light, including only one casualty among their officers. Taking heavy casualties, having lost their commanding officer, and finding themselves hopelessly outnumbered, the Portuguese finally surrendered despite the fact that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> military supplies to continue the action.|$|E
5|$|The Irish {{complaint}} against Wood {{was not that}} <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> copper coins, but that this would introduce too many coins of inferior quality into the Irish economy. These coins would remove valuable silver and gold coins from circulation in the Irish economy, and since the new copper coins would not be minted under Irish authority, {{there was no way}} for the Irish to control the quality and amount. Also, Wood's coin was only one example of allegedly unfavourable economic practices that hurt Ireland; the Irish wanted to have their own national bank and authority to mint their own coinage, and Wood's coin became a way to express their economic-nationalist desires.|$|E
5|$|Their {{ideas were}} well {{received}} by TSR, whose marketing department felt <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> dungeons, {{but not enough}} dragons. Hickman suggested a series of twelve modules, each featuring a different dragon. TSR employee Harold Johnson suggested that Hickman should try to get additional support from other TSR staff members and, {{after a period of}} months, Hickman had the support of Jeff Grubb, Larry Elmore, Roger Moore, Doug Niles, Michael Williams, and others with whom they discussed ideas for the project. Meanwhile, Weis was editing and writing various Endless Quest books for TSR. The Dragonlance group decided that novels should accompany the game modules; TSR reluctantly agreed and hired a writer. Hickman became the design coordinator for Project Overlord, the cover name for what would later be known as the Dragonlance saga.|$|E

5|$|Each summer (June, July, and August in the US), the {{producers}} would outline the storylines for the subsequent season. Before an episode went into production, Kauffman and Crane would revise the script written by another writer, mainly if something concerning either the series or a character felt foreign. Unlike other storylines, {{the idea for}} a relationship between Joey and Rachel was decided on halfway through the eighth season. The creators did not want Ross and Rachel to get back together so soon, and while looking for a romantic impediment, a writer suggested Joey's romantic interest in Rachel. The storyline was incorporated into the season; however, when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikable, the storyline was wrapped up, until it again resurfaced in the season's finale. For the ninth season, the writers were unsure about the amount of storyline to give to Rachel's baby, as they wanted the show neither to revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none. Crane said that it took them a while to accept the idea of a tenth season, which they decided to do because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> stories left to tell to justify the season. Kauffman and Crane would not have signed on for an eleventh season, even if all the cast members had wanted to continue.|$|E
25|$|On 7 September, {{receiving}} {{complaints from}} at least four different women (according to IBA's correspondent for police affairs), the Israel Police determined that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> evidence for an indictment. Katsav {{did not attend the}} ceremony swearing-in Dorit Beinisch as President of the Israeli Supreme Court. On 13 September, the Knesset House Committee approved Katsav's request for leave of absence. The ceremony, normally held at the president's house, was moved to the Knesset.|$|E
25|$|During his mayoralty, Sanders {{called himself}} a socialist {{and was so}} {{described}} in the press. During his first term, his supporters, including the first Citizens Party City Councilor Terry Bouricius, formed the Progressive Coalition, the forerunner of the Vermont Progressive Party. The Progressives never held more than six seats on the 13-member city council, but <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> to keep the council from overriding Sanders's vetoes. Under Sanders, Burlington became the first {{city in the country}} to fund community-trust housing.|$|E

25|$|Grey {{described}} his men killing 40 or 50 French soldiers {{and others who}} came out of the town to gather cockles and periwinkles on 13 May. The French journalist wrote of the same event, relating that some of the hungry townspeople went out to collect shell-fish and were attacked by the English. A little French boy taken on the shore was brought to Grey of Wilton. When asked if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> food for a fortnight, the boy said he had heard the captains say the English would not take the town by famine or force for four or five months yet. Raphael Holinshed puts this event on 4 July, saying that Grey first issued a warning to d'Oysel about the cockle-pickers.|$|E
25|$|Caesar {{was already}} in Crassus' {{political}} debt, but he also made overtures to Pompey, who was unsuccessfully fighting the Senate for ratification of his eastern settlements and farmland for his veterans. Pompey and Crassus had been at odds since they were consuls together in 70 BC, and Caesar knew if he allied himself with one he would lose {{the support of the}} other, so he endeavoured to reconcile them. Between the three of them, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> money and political influence to control public business. This informal alliance, known as the First Triumvirate (rule of three men), was cemented by the marriage of Pompey to Caesar's daughter Julia. Caesar also married again, this time Calpurnia, daughter of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, who was elected to the consulship for the following year.|$|E

25|$|Nearly all Mayan cities {{collapsed}} {{around the}} same time, 900CE. From then until 1500 CE, social organization of the region fragmented into much smaller units and social structure became much less complex. There was some influence from the rising powers of central Mexico but two main indigenous groups emerged during this time, the Zoques and the various Mayan descendents. The Chiapans, for whom the state is named, migrated {{into the center of}} the state during this time and settled around Chiapa de Corzo, the old Mixe–Zoque stronghold. There is evidence that the Aztecs appeared in the center of the state around Chiapa de Corza in the 15thcentury, but were unable to displace the native Chiapa tribe. However, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> influence so that the name of this area and of the state would come from Nahuatl.|$|E
25|$|On April 6, 1917, the U.S. Congress {{declared}} war on Germany and on May 3, 1917, the Regiment recruited 1,969 men, considered at that time as war strength. When the United States entered the war, the U.S. Army Medical Corps believed that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> male physicians to cover their needs. Dr. Dolores Piñero applied for a position as a contract surgeon only to be turned down. After writing {{a letter to the}} Army Surgeon General in Washington, D.C. explaining her intentions, she received a telegram ordering her to report to Camp Las Casas where she was assigned to the Medical Service Corps of the Army Medical Department. Dr. Piñero {{became one of the first}} female doctors to work under contract for the U.S. Army. However, contract physicians had little status within the military. They did not wear uniforms and had little authority.|$|E
25|$|On December 12, 2012, Lambeau Field {{was damaged}} by a minor fire when {{construction}} workers were cutting a metal beam near the fourth floor. The sparks from the cutting landed inside {{a wall and}} ignited the foam insulation. The area was temporarily evacuated and a minor back injury {{to one of the}} responding firefighters was reported. Green Bay Fire Lt. Nick Craig says the fire was small but in an unwieldy area. He says fire officials had to proceed slowly because they didn’t want to open the wall and allow the flames an oxygen supply until <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> water on hand. The fire happened on Aaron Rodgers Day, a day the state proclaimed in honor of the Packers quarterback because Rodgers wears No. 12, and the date that Wednesday was 12-12-12. The fire damage cost $5,000 in repairs.|$|E

25|$|By {{the winter}} of 1946 <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> results that Bardeen {{submitted}} a paper on the surface states to Physical Review. Brattain started experiments to study the surface states through observations made while shining a bright light on the semiconductor's surface. This led to several more papers (one of them co-authored with Shockley), which estimated {{the density of the}} surface states to be more than enough to account for their failed experiments. The pace of the work picked up significantly when they started to surround point contacts between the semiconductor and the conducting wires with electrolytes. Moore built a circuit that allowed them to vary the frequency of the input signal easily. Finally they began to get some evidence of power amplification when Pearson, acting on a suggestion by Shockley, put a voltage on a droplet of glycol borate (a viscous chemical that did not evaporate, commonly used in electrolytic capacitors, and obtained by puncturing an example capacitor with a nail, using a hammer) placed across a P-N junction.|$|E
25|$|The island fox, though {{considered}} a near-threatened species throughout the world, {{is becoming increasingly}} endangered in its endemic environment of the California Channel Islands. A population on an island is smaller than those on the mainland because of limited resources like space, food and shelter. Island populations, therefore, are highly susceptible to external threats ranging from introduced predatory species and humans to extreme weather. On the California Channel Islands, {{it was found that}} the population of the island fox was so low due to an outbreak of canine distemper virus from 1999 to 2000 as well as predation by non-native golden eagles. Since 1993, the eagles have caused the population to decline by as much as 95%. Because of the low number of foxes, the population went through an Allee effect; this is where at low enough densities, an individual's fitness decreases. Conservationists, therefore, had to take healthy breeding pairs out of the wild population to breed them in captivity until <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> foxes to release back into the wild. Nonnative grazers were also removed so that native plants would be able to grow back to their natural height, thereby providing adequate cover and protection for the foxes against golden eagles.|$|E
