5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and {{her mother}} visit her brother Bill and his {{pregnant}} wife Tara around Christmas time. Scully answers the phone, and <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other line, who sounds just like her dead sister Melissa, tells her that someone needs her help. Scully traces the call to a nearby home in San Diego {{where a group of}} cops are investigating the suicide of a woman, Roberta Sim. The lead detective, Kresge, tells Scully that it was impossible for Roberta to have dialed, as she died before the telephone call was made. That night after dinner Scully reveals to her mother that due to her abduction and cancer she is unable to bear children. Scully flashes back to when as a child, she hid her pet rabbit from her brother in a lunchbox, only for it to suffocate and die. Scully receives another telephone call from the same person on her cell phone, which was once again made from the Sim home. Roberta's husband, Marshall, is meeting with two dark-suited men inside his house and has no desire to listen to and help Scully figure out what is going on.|$|E
25|$|The cover art for the U.S. double LP {{version of}} the album is {{different}} from the CD version, featuring a red Q (with a sperm cell as the line in the Q and an egg cell as the circle) on a black background with no other text. It was released on red vinyl. The UK vinyl version cover {{is the same as the}} CD cover. The dashboard/interior with superimposed logos is that of a Fiat 124 Sport Spider, a 1960s–1980s mass market Italian sports car. <b>The</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album disc is musician Dave Catching, who performs on the album.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} German {{banknotes}} remained unchanged during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. During this period, forgery technology made significant advances and so, {{in the late}} 1980s, the Bundesbank decided to issue {{a new series of}} Deutsche Mark banknotes. The colours for each denomination remained unchanged from the previous series but the designs underwent significant changes and a DM 200 denomination was introduced. Famous national artists and scientists were chosen to be portrayed on the new banknotes. Male and female artists were chosen in equal numbers. The buildings in the background of the notes' obverses had a close relationship to the person displayed (e.g., place of birth, place of death, place of work), as well as the second background picture (Lyra and the musician Schumann). The reverses of the notes refer to the work of <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> obverse.|$|E

Kachimov meanwhile, is on the phone, and asks [...] "is it enroute?" [...] to <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other end, and appears pleased to the response. In the next episode, it is revealed to be a Russian submarine planning a cyber attack on a submarine communications cable. In the end, Harry visits Wes Carter, Adam's son, to tell him his father died.|$|E
500|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is on a {{business}} call with the investors {{and members of the}} business venture he is up for. Many distractions from the background make the call difficult. At the end of the day, Jim apologizes, but then hears <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone saying this is not working out. Meanwhile, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) convinces several {{of the men in the}} office to grow mustaches for [...] "Movember". He says he is doing this to support the cure for prostate cancer but is actually using it for a chance to socialize more with the office, to no avail. Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) later shows Erin his mustache, but she finds it repulsive. He shaves it off shortly after that.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{began in}} September 1995, and {{took place at}} the CTS Studios in London, with Madonna and co-actors Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce. Engineer David Reitzas performed the mixing of the track at Larrabee North Studios, utilizing their Solid State Logic 9000 J series consoles for the mix. For the first day's sessions, music supervisor David Caddick suggested to record [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] with the 84 piece orchestra backing Madonna's vocals. However, Lloyd Webber was critical of [...] the recording arrangements done in the studio. The cast was also nervous. Flick noted that Banderas found the experience [...] "scary" [...] while Madonna was [...] "petrified" [...] when it came to recording the songs. [...] "I had to sing 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber... I was a complete mess and was sobbing afterwards. I thought I had done a terrible job", the singer recalled. Conductor John Mauceri remembered another challenge the production faced was adapting the stage numbers into a feature film; [...] "On film, it's different than being on stage because <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen in front of you is never farther than someone on the pillow in bed next to you". Parker declared the first day of recording as [...] "Black Monday", since it was [...] "filled with trepidation and nerves... All of us came from very different worlds—from popular music, from movies, and from musical theater—and so we were very apprehensive".|$|E

500|$|On 18 June 1999, Ackah {{anonymously}} telephoned Brent social services, expressing {{concern over}} Climbié's situation. Samantha Hunt, the customer-service officer {{who received the}} call at the One Stop Shop at Brent House, faxed the referral to the children's social work department on that same day. Nobody picked up the referral on that Friday afternoon, {{and what happened to}} it was—according to Lord Laming, who headed the subsequent inquiry—the subject of [...] "some of the most bizarre and contradictory evidence" [...] the inquiry heard. A few days later, possibly on 21 June 1999, Ackah phoned Brent social services again to make sure her concerns were being addressed. Ackah said that she was told by <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other end of the telephone that [...] "probably they [...] had done something about it". This call, however, did not trigger a new, separate referral. The first referral was not seen until three weeks later on 6 July 1999, when Robert Smith, the group administrative officer, logged the details of the referral onto the computer, with details of Climbié's injuries. Laming said the delay constituted [...] "a significant missed opportunity" [...] to protect Climbié. Edward Armstrong, the team manager of the intake duty team, said that he completed a duty manager's action sheet not for the 18 June referral, which he said never arrived in his office, but for the 21 June referral, which was a less serious case than the first; Laming called this version of events [...] "wholly unbelievable". Laming said that Armstrong's evidence was out of line with that of the other Brent witnesses, that the quality of it [...] " [...] much to be desired", and that Armstrong's insistence that he dealt with the 21 June referral was an attempt to cover up his team's [...] "inept handling" [...] of a genuine child protection case.|$|E

2500|$|Because of the {{controversy}} Hitler's War generated, it was a best-seller in 1977. In particular, Hitler's War was a best-seller in Germany The American author Gill Seidel summed up the appeal of Hitler's War to Germans as:"It {{is not difficult to}} explain its appeal. The argument of the book may be summed up as: [...] "If only the Führer had known about the murder of the Jews, he would had stopped it'. For...Germans who do not want {{to face up to the}} past, it was easy to be persuaded that if Hitler did not know, then neither did <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2009 {{the report}} of the EU Commission on Enlargement stated that [...] "The Turkish armed forces have a health {{regulation}} which defines homosexuality as a ‘psychosexual’ illness and identifies homosexuals as unfit for military service. Conscripts who declare their homosexuality have to provide photographic proof (a photograph of <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> receiving end of anal intercourse). A small number have had to undergo humiliating medical examinations." [...] These steps are taken, according to the military, {{to make sure that the}} system is not being exploited by deserters in order to skip mandatory military service.|$|E
2500|$|Digital {{switches}} encode {{the speech}} going on, in 8,000 time slices per second. At each time slice, a digital PCM {{representation of the}} tone is made.

In other words, when someone uses a telephone, the speaker's voice is [...] "encoded" [...] then reconstructed for <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other end.

2500|$|Bono {{described}} the song's subject {{as that of}} a phone call from someone in Hell who enjoys being there and telling <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{other end of the line}} what he has learned. The lyrics are written as a series of aphorisms that Bono collected during the album's recording.

The song became the band's second number-one single in the UK and was successful among alternative rock radio audiences.|$|E
2500|$|This second {{portrait}} of Dr. Morinaud, probably {{from his office}} on Avenue de l'Opera, shows Gleizes again giving prominence to the curvilinear elements that had been important in his style in 1907-09. The painting {{became the subject of}} a lively debate between Marinetti and Lhote (La Vie des Lettres et des Arts, no. 16, 1922, p. 10,) in which the Futurist leader insisted that a Futurist painter would have attempted to [...] "give the ensemble of visual sensations capable of being experienced by <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> balcony". Lhote replied that such preoccupations were [...] "literary" [...] and [...] "psychological", and outside the interests of the French Cubists. He was wrong for, although not primarily concerned with the reality of visual sensations, Gleizes was, nevertheless, deeply committed to symbolic and psychological relationships.

2500|$|The {{results of}} the {{thousands}} of teeth analyzed, published in the November 24, 1961, issue of the journal Science, revealed elevated levels of radioactive compounds in the first sets of teeth that had been collected. President John F. Kennedy was made aware of the research results while he was negotiating a treaty with the United Kingdom and Soviet Union to place controls on nuclear testing. His call to the Reiss home was answered by her son; <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{other end of the phone}} said, [...] "This is John Kennedy, can I talk to your mom?" [...] Further analysis by the team led to the conclusion that children born in 1963 had absorbed levels of strontium-90 that were 50 times higher than those found in children born a decade earlier. Her husband, Eric Reiss, testified before the United States Senate when it was considering ratification of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Later research showed that levels of strontium-90 in the cohort born in 1968, after the treaty had gone into effect, had declined by 50 percent.|$|E

2500|$|The third element {{incorporated}} into many definitions {{is that of}} intentionality – the death must be intended, rather than being accidental, and {{the intent of the}} action must be a [...] "merciful death". Michael Wreen argued that [...] "the principal thing that distinguishes euthanasia from intentional killing simpliciter is the agent's motive: it must be a good motive insofar as the good of the person killed is concerned." [...] Similarly, Heather Draper speaks to the importance of motive, arguing that [...] "the motive forms a crucial part of arguments for euthanasia, because it must be {{in the best interests of}} <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> receiving end." [...] Definitions such as that offered by the House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics take this path, where euthanasia is defined as [...] "a deliberate intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, to relieve intractable suffering." [...] Beauchamp and Davidson also highlight Baruch Brody's [...] "an act of euthanasia is one in which one person... (A) kills another person (B) for the benefit of the second person, who actually does benefit from being killed".|$|E
2500|$|This term also {{refers to}} a series of living donor transplants in which one donor donates to the highest {{recipient}} on the waiting list and the transplant center utilizes that donation to facilitate multiple transplants. These other transplants are otherwise impossible due to blood type or antibody barriers to transplantation. The [...] "Good Samaritan" [...] kidney is transplanted into one of the other recipients, whose donor in turn donates his or her kidney to an unrelated recipient. Depending on <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> waiting list, this has sometimes been repeated for up to six pairs, with the final donor donating to the person {{at the top of the}} list. This method allows all organ recipients to get a transplant even if their living donor is not a match to them. This further benefits people below any of these recipients on waiting lists, as they move closer to the top of the list for a deceased-donor organ. Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore and Northwestern University's Northwestern Memorial Hospital have received significant attention for pioneering transplants of this kind. [...] In February 2012, the last link in a record 60-person domino chain of 30 kidney transplants was completed.|$|E
2500|$|For live programs, spoken words {{comprising}} the television program's soundtrack are transcribed by a human operator (a speech-to-text reporter) using stenotype or stenomask type of machines, whose phonetic output is instantly translated into text {{by a computer}} and displayed on the screen. This technique {{was developed in the}} 1970s as an initiative of the BBC's Ceefax teletext service. In collaboration with the BBC, a university student took on the research project of writing the first phonetics-to-text conversion program for this purpose. Sometimes, the captions of live broadcasts, like news bulletins, sports events, live entertainment shows, and other live shows, fall behind by a few seconds. This delay is because the machine does not know what the person is going to say next, so after <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show says the sentence, the captions appear. Automatic computer speech recognition now works well when trained to recognize a single voice, and so since 2003, the BBC does live subtitling by having someone re-speak what is being broadcast. Live captioning is also a form of real-time text. Meanwhile, sport events on channels like ESPN are using court reporters, using a special (steno) keyboard and individually constructed [...] "dictionaries." ...|$|E
