5|$|After the Allies {{landed in}} Sumatra, {{many of the}} Muslim Indian {{soldiers}} brought by the English deserted and joined the native revolutionaries. They planned strategy in the mosque, including <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> on a British barracks. One of these Indian soldiers, {{who had died in}} <b>the</b> <b>assault,</b> was buried at the mosque. Since 1950, after Indonesia's independence was recognised, the Ganting Grand Mosque has hosted numerous statesmen from both Indonesia and abroad, including Vice President Mohammad Hatta, Minister of Defence Sultan HamengkubuwanaIX, and General Abdul Haris Nasution. Foreign dignitaries who have visited the mosque included people from Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces {{then began}} {{preparing}} for the invasion of mainland Japan, Operation Downfall.

I Corps was to lead <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> on Miyazaki, in southern Kyūshū, with the 25th, 33rd, and 41st Infantry Divisions. Opposing them would be the Japanese 57th Army, with the 154th, 156th, and 212th Japanese Infantry Divisions. Before <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> could be launched, Japan surrendered, following the use of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E

Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey's VII Amphibious Force allotted 6 Landing Ships, Tank (LSTs), 10 High speed transports (APDs) and 17 Landing Craft Infantry (LCIs). A last minute hitch developed on 30 December when {{it was discovered that}} only nine APDs would be available. New embarkation tables were drawn up, shifting personnel not required in <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> waves to LCIs, and the landing schedule was revised {{in the light of the}} reduced number of landing craft.|$|E

Virtually all the material needed for <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> was on hand, on the way, or promised, thanks to Devers' efforts to preserve the stockpile of Anvil stores and supplies even when the operation was in doubt.

25|$|<b>The</b> term <b>assault</b> rifle, {{when used}} in its proper context, militarily or by its {{specific}} functionality, has a generally accepted definition with the firearm manufacturing community.

5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> {{is known}} to popular history as Pickett's Charge, overall command was given to James Longstreet, and Pickett {{was one of his}} {{division}}al commanders. Lee did tell Longstreet that Pickett's fresh division should lead <b>the</b> <b>assault,</b> so the name is appropriate, although some recent historians have used the name Pickett-Pettigrew-Trimble Assault (or, less frequently, Longstreet's Assault) to more fairly distribute the credit (or blame). With Hill sidelined, Pettigrew's and Trimble's divisions were delegated to Longstreet's authority as well. Thus, Pickett's name has been lent to a charge in which he commanded 3 out of the 11 brigades while under the supervision of his corps commander throughout. Pickett's men were almost exclusively from Virginia, with the other divisions consisting of troops from North Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. The supporting troops under Wilcox and Lang were from Alabama and Florida.|$|E
5|$|As CTroop {{reached the}} forming up point for <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> it met {{heavy machine gun}} fire from the gun battery.

Realising that the man carrying the ladder had been killed crossing the beach and the ladder left behind, they looked for another way to cross. They discovered wooden planks bridging the gap that the defenders used to access the town. DTroop crossed and captured the machine gun posts around the battery. With the machine guns taken, EandFTroops began their assault. The attack was successful but they discovered the guns were only wooden dummies made from telegraph poles. The real guns had been removed three days previously and positioned further inland.|$|E
