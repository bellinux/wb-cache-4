5|$|All {{but two of}} the {{handcart}} companies {{successfully completed}} the rugged journey, with relatively few problems and only a few deaths. However, the fourth and fifth companies, known as the Willie and Martin Companies, respectively, had serious problems. The companies left Iowa City, Iowa, in July 1856, very late to begin the trip across the plains. They met severe winter weather west of present-day Casper, Wyoming, and continued to cope with deep snow and storms {{for the remainder of the}} journey. Food supplies were soon exhausted. Young organized a rescue effort that brought <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> <b>in,</b> but more than 210 of the 980 emigrants in the two parties died.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, Braathens signed {{agreements}} {{with many of}} the large companies in Norway as a prioritized airline. Several of the contracts had been secured by the airline offering discounts to <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> <b>in</b> exchange for not allowing their customers to collect frequent flyer points.

5|$|During the {{discussion}} about deregulation, Braathens SAFE considered several possibilities to strengthen itself. In particular, it had discussions with the large European airlines Lufthansa, British Airways and KLM about an alliance, but these were rejected by Braathens SAFE, stating that the agreements were all about getting traffic to the partner's hub. Minister of Transport, Kjell Opseth and director of SAS in Norway, Jan Reinås, both proposed a merger between Braathens SAFE and SAS, {{to ensure that the}} company had a 100% market share on the primary routes before the merger. This would, according to them, secure that no foreign company could compete with the merged company. The proposal was rejected by Braathens SAFE's management. Still, negotiations started between <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> <b>in</b> 1992, although they were quickly abandoned. The press reported the price of Braathens SAFE to be NOK1.2 billion, but that this had been rejected as too expensive by SAS.|$|E

One effect of this structure was to minimize the presence of hostile takeovers in Japan, because no entities could challenge {{the power of the}} banks.|$|E

Indeed, morale remained high within the British line. The Martini–Henry rifle was a powerful weapon and the men were experienced. Additionally, the shell fire of the Royal Artillery forced some Zulu regiments to take cover behind the reverse slope of a hill. Nevertheless, the left horn of the Zulu advance was moving to outflank and envelop the British right.|$|E
25|$|But Smith {{could not}} keep from dabbling in {{business}} ventures. He made large, ill-advised investments in Los Angeles' Murray M.
