40|$|Technological advancements can {{influence}} both the fishing {{power of a}} fleet and the fishing strategies itemploys. To investigate these potential linkages, we examined almost three decades of data (1981 &# 8211; 2008) from French tropical tuna purse seiners operating in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Applying a sequence ofstatistical methods at different temporal and spatial scales, we analyzed two indicators of fishing power(sets per boat-day on fish aggregating devices (FADs) and sets per boat-day on free-swimming schools) each of which represent a distinct fishing mode. Our {{results show that the}} increasing modernizationof this fleet has led to increases in both fishing power and the available number of fishing strategies tochoose from. A key output of this analysis was the breakdown of fishing power time series (for each fishingmode) into separate periods of continuous years during which catchability was assumed to be constant,thus identifying regime shifts. This partitioning allowed us to identify when key changes occurred inthe fishery. Changes in FAD-associated fishing were mostly driven by the introduction of radio beacons(early 1990 s) which lead to an increase in fishing effort and an expansion of fishing grounds (directeffect) and the implementation of time-area management measures which resulted in a fragmentationof the traditional fishing grounds in the 2000 s (indirect effect). During the same period, fishing on free-swimming schools also increased despite the biomass of stocks decreasing and fishing grounds remainingunchanged. This suggests these increases were driven by improvements in fish detection technology (e. g.,bird radars, sonar). These identified increases are not entirely unexpected: indeed it is widely recognizedthat fishing power in the purse <b>seine</b> <b>tuna</b> fishery has increased over time. However, these increases donot necessarily occur linearly.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. The {{silky shark}} (Carcharhinus falciformis) is a circum-tropical species {{found in all}} oceans between 20 ° North and South latitude. This {{distribution}} tends to overlap with the preferred habitat of three heavily exploited tropical tuna species (bigeye, Thunnus obesus, yellowfin T. albacares, and skipjack, Katsuwonus pelamis). The western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) is the most productive tuna fishery on the globe (2, 613, 528 mt in 2012) with the largest proportion of tuna landed via purse seine fishing operations (69 %). In large part, this productivity is feasible because in the WCPO, the <b>tuna</b> purse <b>seine</b> fishery utilizes drifting fish aggregating devices (FADs) to attract and hold tuna and thereby reduce search times and cost. Juvenile silky sharks also aggregate in large numbers at FADs and, as a result, comprise the largest component of the incidental elasmobranch catch taken in the tropical <b>tuna</b> purse <b>seine</b> FAD fishery. A stock assessment revealed that silky shark spawning biomass, median size and CPUE have all declined {{and concluded that the}} WCPO stock(s) are overfished and that overfishing is occurring. Population analysis for this species has shown that high mortality during the juvenile life stages has the largest impact on population growth. Information on the basic biology, behavioral ecology and habitat use of this species is deficient. To fill these data gaps and better manage the impact that fishing has on this species I conducted an analysis of the survival rates and total mortality of sharks captured in purse seine gear. Survival was related to the stage during the fishing operation when sharks were released. This work was augmented by an investigation of the physiological disruptions that lead to mortality when sharks are captured in a purse seine. This was achieved by measuring stress hormones, blood gases and electrolyte concentrations in sharks sampled at various stages of the fishing process and by an analysis of the habitat use and movement behavior of juvenile silky sharks in the Pacific Ocean.

Mobulids have life history characteristics (matrotrophic reproduction, extremely low fecundity, and delayed age of first reproduction) that make them exceptionally susceptible to overexploitation.

The scientific community has expressed concern over {{the consequences of this}} fishing practice in terms of yield per recruit and suspected detrimental effects on FAD-associated tunas. To explore possible detrimental effects, we compared stomach fullness, fish plumpness, growth rate, and migration behaviour between free school and drifting FAD-associated tunas for skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis and yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares caught in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Significant differences in fish plumpness and individual growth rates were found, suggesting that individuals associated with drifting FADs were less healthy than those in free schools. Since stomach fullness indicated that tunas associated with FADs eat less than those in free schools, the difference in growth rate and condition could be the consequence of altered feeding patterns. For each species, significant changes in migratory direction and displacement rates were observed in the presence of drifting FADs.
