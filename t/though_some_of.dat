5|$|Brolgas are gregarious creatures; {{the basic}} social unit {{is a pair}} or small family group of {{about three or four}} birds, usually parents {{together}} with juvenile offspring, <b>though</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> such groups are unrelated. In the non-breeding season, they gather into large flocks, which appear to be many self-contained individual groups rather than a single social unit. Within the flock, families tend to remain separate and to coordinate their activities with one another rather than with the flock as a whole.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, after Smith {{returned}} from Germany, she published her second volume Songs for Little Children, Part 2. As in her previous work, {{most of the}} songs were in major keys with the most common being A-flat major and E-flat major. Second, third, fourth and fifth intervals were typical in her voice scores with the piano accompaniment creating interest through varied rhythm patterns. In this volume, most of the compositions were Smith's own work, <b>though</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the pieces were adaptations of German folk songs.|$|E
5|$|Most {{fish are}} ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), {{allowing}} their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, <b>though</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna {{can hold a}} higher core temperature. Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They {{can be found in}} nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and anglerfish). With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Obergefell v. Hodges, U.S. states passed several {{different types of}} state constitutional amendments banning legal recognition of same-sex unions in U.S. state constitutions, referred to by proponents as defense of marriage amendments. The amendments define marriage as a union between one man and one woman and prevent civil unions or same-sex marriages from being legalized, <b>though</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the amendments bar only the latter. The Obergefell {{decision in}} June 2015 invalidated these state constitutional amendments insofar as they prevented same-sex couples from marrying, even though the actual text of these amendments remain written into the state constitutions.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} original woodwork, sills, door frames, {{and interior}} doors, are all solid oak. The interior walls are 12inches thick and, either painted or covered with paneling. An open, double staircase leads {{from the first}} floor to {{the second and third}} floors and the center of the building houses an elevator which moves from the basement to the third floor. The interior floors are all white pine wood, <b>though</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the floors have now been carpeted. First floor ceilings are 15feet high, with doors at a height of 12feet. The second floor features the courtrooms, which, through the 1980s remodel, had the ceilings lowered to 10feet. The interior renovation was completed at a cost of US$1.5 million.|$|E

5|$|The {{voters of}} Henderson County chose Dixon to {{represent}} them at the state constitutional convention of 1849. The Whigs nominated him to chair the convention, but he lost to the Democratic nominee James Guthrie {{by a vote of}} 50 to 43. A large slaveholder, Dixon introduced numerous measures {{to protect the rights of}} slaveholders in the new constitution. Among them were assertions that slave property was just as inviolable as any other property, that the rights of property were above constitutional sanction, and that absolute power over property cannot exist in a republic. <b>Though</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these ideas were challenged, all eventually found their way into the Kentucky Constitution of 1850.|$|E
5|$|Upon his adoption, Octavius assumed his great-uncle's name Gaius Julius Caesar. Roman {{citizens}} adopted into a {{new family}} usually retained their old nomen in cognomen form (e.g., Octavianus for one who had been an Octavius, Aemilianus for one who had been an Aemilius, etc.). However, <b>though</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his contemporaries did, {{there is no evidence}} that Octavius ever himself officially used the name Octavianus, as it would have made his modest origins too obvious. Historians usually refer to the new Caesar as Octavian during the time between his adoption and his assumption of the name Augustus in 27BC in order to avoid confusing the dead dictator with his heir.|$|E
5|$|During the war, all {{the uranium}} from the Congo {{had gone to}} the United States, as had that {{captured}} in Europe by the Alsos Mission, even <b>though</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> it passed through British hands. The entire output of the Shinkolobwe mine was contracted to the Combined Development Trust until 1956, but in March 1946 there were fears that the mine might be exhausted in 1947, resulting in a severe uranium shortage. After some negotiation, Groves and Chadwick agreed on a division of uranium ore production, with everything up to March 1946 going to the United States, and supplies being shared equally thereafter. At the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 31 July 1946, the financial arrangements were adjusted. Previously, the two countries had split the costs equally; henceforth each would only pay for what they actually received. Britain was therefore able to secure the uranium it needed without having to outbid the United States, and paid for it in sterling, while receiving reimbursement for the supplies allocated to the United States in dollars, thus easing Britain's dollar shortage.|$|E

5|$|Even <b>though</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his {{soldiers}} came within 60 meters of the pillbox, after 19 of them (over a third) {{were killed and}} the sun began rising in the horizon, Kotzer decided to retreat, unable to receive official permission due to communication problems. He ordered all of his troops to collect the wounded and any weapons they could carry, helping with the task himself. The dead were left in the field, including the medics (not a single medic survived). The injured were brought under fire into the wadi and at about 07:00 the force {{made its way to}} an unoccupied two-storey building on the east bank. After the Egyptians started shelling the building with mortars, Kotzer's company began to move towards Gan Yavne.|$|E
5|$|Fossils {{from other}} parts of the UK and Iberia, mostly {{isolated}} teeth, have subsequently been attributed to Baryonyx or similar animals. Isolated teeth and bones from the Isle of Wight, including hand bones and a vertebra, have been attributed to this genus. A maxilla fragment from La Rioja, Spain, was attributed in 1995. In 1999 a postorbital bone, a squamosal bone, a tooth, vertebra remains, metacarpals, and a phalanx from the Sala de los Infantes deposit in Burgos Province, Spain, were attributed to an immature Baryonyx (<b>though</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these elements are unknown in the holotype), and dinosaur tracks near Burgos have been identified as those of Baryonyx or a similar theropod. In 2011 a specimen (ML1190) from the Papo Seco Formation in Boca do Chapim, Portugal, with a fragmentary dentary, teeth, vertebrae, ribs, hip bones, a scapula, and a phalanx bone, was attributed to Baryonyx, the most complete Iberian remains of the animal. The skeletal elements of this specimen are also represented in the more complete holotype NHM R9951, except for the mid-neck vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|In December 1994, Croatia and the RSK made an {{economic}} agreement to restore road and rail links, water and gas supplies, {{and use of}} {{a part of the}} Adria oil pipeline. Even <b>though</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the agreement was never implemented, a section of the ZagrebBelgrade motorway passing through RSK territory near Okučani and the pipeline were both opened. Following a deadly incident that occurred in late April 1995 on the recently opened motorway, Croatia reclaimed all of the RSK's territory in western Slavonia during Operation Flash, taking full control of the territory by 4 May, three days after the battle began. In response, the ARSK attacked Zagreb using M-87 Orkan missiles with cluster munitions. Subsequently, Milošević sent a senior Yugoslav Army officer to command the ARSK, along with arms, field officers and thousands of Serbs born in the RSK area who had been forcibly conscripted by the ARSK.|$|E

5|$|The Voćin {{massacre}} was {{the killing}} of 43 civilians in Voćin, Croatia, by the Serbian White Eagles paramilitary unit on 13 December 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence. The massacre was carried out after the unit was ordered to abandon the village before the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) recaptured the area in Operation Papuk-91. All the victims were local Croats, save one Serb, {{who had tried to}} protect his neighbours. Gunfire was the leading cause of death, <b>though</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the victims were killed with axes or chainsaws, or were burned to death. The victims exhibited signs of torture and were left unburied. On the night of 13–14 December, the White Eagles dynamited a 550-year-old church in the village.|$|E
5|$|The chief tax {{imposed by}} Charles was a feudal levy known as ship money, which proved even more unpopular, and lucrative, than {{poundage}} and tonnage before it. Previously, collection of ship money had been authorised only during wars, and only on coastal regions. Charles, however, {{argued that there}} was no legal bar to collecting the tax for defence during peacetime and throughout the whole of the kingdom. Ship money, paid directly to the Treasury of the Navy, provided between £150,000 to £200,000 annually between 1634 and 1638, after which yields declined. Opposition to ship money steadily grew, but the 12 common law judges of England declared that the tax was within the king's prerogative, <b>though</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them had reservations. The prosecution of John Hampden for non-payment in 1637–38 provided a platform for popular protest, and the judges only found against Hampden by the narrow margin of 7–5.|$|E
5|$|The first humans of the Colorado River basin {{were likely}} Paleo-Indians of the Clovis and Folsom cultures, who first {{arrived on the}} Colorado Plateau about 12,000 years ago. Very little human {{activity}} occurred in the watershed until {{the rise of the}} Desert Archaic Culture, which from 8,000 to 2,000 years ago constituted most of the region's human population. These prehistoric inhabitants led a generally nomadic lifestyle, gathering plants and hunting small animals (<b>though</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the earliest peoples hunted larger mammals that became extinct in North America {{after the end of the}} Pleistocene epoch). Another notable early group was the Fremont culture, whose peoples inhabited the Colorado Plateau from 2,000 to 700 years ago. The Fremont were likely the first peoples of the Colorado River basin to domesticate crops and construct masonry dwellings; they also left behind a large amount of rock art and petroglyphs, many of which have survived to the present day.|$|E
