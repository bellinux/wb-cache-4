5|$|A {{man named}} Gianni Schicchi is only briefly {{referred}} to in Dante's Inferno Canto XXX. In that canto, Dante visits the Circle of Impersonators and sees a man savagely attacking another.

5|$|After it was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> novel {{would be}} {{released}} on 21 July 2007, Warner Bros. shortly thereafter said that the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix {{would be released}} shortly before the novel would be released, on 13 July 2007, making many people proclaim that July 2007, was the month of Harry Potter.|$|E

Sukarno uses the Gilchrist Document to spread rumours and distrust among the populace, demoting his commander of the military, while the Chinese ambassador is sent home.|$|E
5|$|Being like Lofty was {{something}} I aspired to without realising it. When I joined the Regiment I was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{best way to}} survive those first years in the Sabre squadron was to pick out someone who you thought {{you would like to}} be. Shut up, watch and listen. For me {{there were a number of}} the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service that I learned that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E
5|$|Brigadier General Samuel Holden Parsons and Colonel Atlee were {{stationed}} farther {{north on the}} Gowanus Road. Parsons was a lawyer from Connecticut who had recently secured a commission in the Continental Army; Atlee was {{a veteran of the}} French and Indian War in command of the First Regiment of Pennsylvania Musketry. Putnam had been awakened by a guard at 03:00 and <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British were attacking through the Gowanus Pass.

Moses replied to God <b>that</b> while <b>the</b> Israelites had not yet sinned, God had called them [...] "My people," [...] as in [...] God had said, [...] "And I will bring forth My hosts, My people." [...] But Moses noted <b>that</b> once <b>the</b> Israelites had sinned, God told Moses (in [...] ), [...] "Go, get down, for your people have corrupted themselves." [...] Moses <b>told</b> God <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Israelites were indeed God's people, and God's inheritance, as [...] reports Moses saying, [...] "Yet they are Your people and Your inheritance." ...|$|R

5|$|Charles Darwin {{had been}} <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Beagle was {{expected}} to sail {{about the end of}} September 1831, but fitting out took longer. The Admiralty Instructions were received on 14 November, and on 23 November she was moved to anchorage, ready to depart. Repeated Westerly gales caused delays, and forced them to turn back after departing on 10 and 21 December. Drunkenness at Christmas lost another day. Finally, on the morning of 27 December, the Beagle left its anchorage in the Barn Pool, under Mount Edgecumbe {{on the west side of}} Plymouth Sound and set out on its surveying expedition.|$|E
5|$|During the Singer World Series {{tournament in}} Sri Lanka in September 1994, which {{involved}} India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Australia, the Australian team {{stayed at the}} Oberoi Hotel in the capital Colombo. There was a casino {{in close proximity to}} the hotel, which Waugh and Warne visited. Team manager Colin Egar had advised Warne that he had been <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> venue was unsavoury, but he was vague in his comments, and at the time, casinos were not perceived as trouble spots or traps for unwary cricketers.|$|E
5|$|In 97 AD, Ban Chao sent an envoy named Gan Ying {{to explore}} the far west. Gan made his way from the Tarim Basin to Parthia and reached the Persian Gulf. Gan left a {{detailed}} account of western countries; he apparently reached as far as Mesopotamia, then {{under the control of the}} Parthian Empire. He intended to sail to the Roman Empire, but was discouraged when <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> trip was dangerous and could take two years. Deterred, he returned to China bringing much new information on the countries to the west of Chinese-controlled territories, as far as the Mediterranean Basin.|$|E

5|$|In {{the novels}} Halo: Fall of Reach and Halo: The Flood, it is <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Grunts are methane {{breathers}} and described as dog-like. They have methane suits {{that allow them}} to remove the breathing apparatuses they usually wear to sustain them in a non-methane atmosphere. In Halo Reach, if a player kills a Grunt in a particular way, their methane tank will ignite causing them to fly and bounce around the area out of control, causing damage if they hit the player.|$|E
5|$|Jones sought {{legal advice}} and was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Duke would {{probably}} win a {{legal action against}} the A The A {{was in such a}} precarious financial position that any successful legal action against them would likely have forced the line through Quainton Road to close, severing the Tramway's connection with the national network altogether. Meanwhile, local dairy farmers began to switch to beef and butter, causing a drop in milk transport. From its peak of 20,994tons carried in 1877, goods traffic fell in each of the next four years, dropping to 9,139tons (9,286t) in 1881.|$|E
5|$|On May 21, 1952, {{large numbers}} of trucks were spotted by Jersey City police {{entering}} {{the city on the}} skyway. Upon pulling over the drivers, they were <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> exit in Newark for the truck route was closed for construction. A call to Newark police confirmed the situation. Hudson County police refused to force trucks to exit before Jersey City, since there was no state law banning trucks from the skyway. Jersey City Police Chief James McNamara gave in, and trucks were temporarily allowed to use the skyway, though only in one direction.|$|E

5|$|The team {{conducted}} intense preparations {{during the}} spring and fall practices before the 1940 season. On one occasion, Stanford athletic director Al Masters angrily complained that the maintenance department had left on the practice field lights, only to be <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> team was still practicing. In one scrimmage, the varsity offense managed only a single touchdown against the freshman team, which prompted Shaughnessy to secretly draft a single-wing playbook in the event that the T formation failed.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been cases of {{available}} treatment being withheld during clinical trials. In 1996 in Kano, Nigeria, the drug company Pfizer compared a new antibiotic during a meningitis outbreak to a competing antibiotic that {{was known to be}} effective at a higher dose than was used during the trial. Goldacre writes that 11 children died, divided almost equally between the two groups. The families taking part in the trial were apparently not <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> competing antibiotic at the effective dose was available from Médecins Sans Frontières in the next-door building.|$|E

5|$|When the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{reached the}} Platte in 1804, {{they found the}} Kitkehahkis (whom they mistakenly called Arapahos) living there.

5|$|While {{traveling}} from Shandong into North Zhili, Choe noticed {{a multitude of}} boats passing by which held officials from the Ministries of War, Justice, and Personnel.

Brook writes that it was quite a comfortable privilege for disgraced and dismissed officials to be escorted by the courier service, yet even this saving of face was still a firm reminder of their banishment from court.|$|E
