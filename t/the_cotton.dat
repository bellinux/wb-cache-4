5|$|Zahir's rule radically {{changed the}} {{landscape}} of Galilee. With the restoration and re-fortification of Acre {{and the establishment of}} the secondary port city of Haifa, Galilee significantly strengthened its ties with the Mediterranean world. Following Zahir's death, his successor Jazzar Pasha maintained <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> monopoly Zahir had established and Galilee's economy remained almost completely dependent on <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> trade. The region prospered for decades, but with the rise of <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> market in the southern United States during the early-mid 19th century, European demand shifted away from Palestine's cotton and because of its dependency on the crop, the region experienced a sharp economic downturn from which it could not recover. <b>The</b> <b>cotton</b> crop was largely abandoned, as were many villages, and the peasantry shifted its focus to subsistence agriculture.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cottons</b> Breccia {{is part of}} {{the upper}} Neoproterozoic (Ediacaran: 586 – 572 Ma) Grassy Group, exposed on King Island, Tasmania. This {{formation}} has been widely interpreted as an unambiguous tillite, in support of tectono-climatic models that invoke catastrophic latest Neoproterozoic global glaciation. However, dissenting opinions interpret <b>the</b> <b>Cottons</b> Breccia as a tectonic breccia. In this paper,we reviewthe tectonostratigraphy of <b>the</b> <b>Cottons</b> Breccia, and <b>the</b> enclosing Grassy Group. We find no unambiguous evidence for a direct glacial origin, as postulated by some early workers. An interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>Cottons</b> Breccia as a deposit within half-graben in the shoulder regions of an actively developing latest Neoproterozoic volcanic rifted margin is consistent with all the available sedimentological, structural, geochronological, and tectonic evidence...|$|R

5|$|From the 1830s onward, Mobile {{expanded}} into {{a city of}} commerce with a primary focus on <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> and slave trades. Many slaves were transported by ship in the coastwise slave trade from the Upper South. There were many businesses in the city related to the slave trade – people to make clothes, food, and supplies for the slave traders and their wards. The city's booming businesses attracted merchants from the North; by 1850 10% of its population was from New York City, which was deeply involved in <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> industry. Mobile was the slave-trading center of the state until the 1850s, when it was surpassed by Montgomery.|$|E

40|$|Transgenic Bt cotton {{developed}} against lepidopteran pests may not {{be compatible}} with parasitoid of secondary pests such as Bemisia tabaci which attack many plants such as cotton. In this study, the effects of Bt <b>cotton</b> on <b>the</b> demographic parameters of Encarsia formosa, parasitoid of B. tabaci were assessed. The data were analysed using the age specific, two-sex life table parameters. The results indicated that pre-adult developmental time, the total preoviposition period (TPOP) and the adult preoviposition period (APOP) in <b>the</b> Bt <b>cotton</b> were significantly longer than in <b>the</b> non-Bt <b>cotton.</b> Also, fecundity and body size in both lines were significantly different. The fecundity was 23. 64 ± 0. 73 and 43. 75 ± 0. 89 eggs/females in the Bt and non-Bt <b>cotton,</b> respectively. All <b>the</b> population parameters were affected by <b>the</b> Bt <b>cotton.</b> <b>The</b> intrinsic rate of increase (r) was 0. 15 day- 1 in <b>the</b> non-Bt <b>cotton</b> but it was 0. 10 day- 1 in <b>the</b> Bt <b>cotton.</b> <b>The</b> finite rate of increase (λ) was 1. 11 day- 1 in <b>the</b> non-Bt <b>cotton</b> whilst it was 1. 08 in <b>the</b> Bt <b>cotton.</b> <b>The</b> net reproductive rate (R 0) in <b>the</b> non-Bt <b>cotton</b> was 36. 75 but in <b>the</b> Bt <b>cotton</b> these parameters showed 19. 62 offspring/individual. Also, the mean generation time (T) in the non-Bt and Bt cotton was 22. 69 and 27. 79 days, respectively. The results illustrated, that although transgenic crops are effective tools for management of the target pests, they can adversely affect, either directly or indirectly, the natural enemies dependent on these plants...|$|R

5|$|The high European {{demand for}} the product enabled Zahir to grow wealthy and finance his {{autonomous}} sheikhdom. This control of <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> market also allowed him to gain unofficial control over all of the Sidon Eyalet, outside the city of Sidon itself. With mixed success, Zahir attempted to have French merchant ships redirected from the ports of Tyre and Sidon to Haifa instead, in order {{to benefit from the}} customs fees he could exact.

5|$|The {{history of}} <b>the</b> <b>Cotton</b> {{manuscript}} itself is quite complex. The list of early writers above mentions {{that it may}} have been in the possession of at least two of them. It was owned by John Leland, the antiquary, in the 1540s. It probably became available after the dissolution of the monasteries, in which the property of many religious houses was confiscated and sold. Leland died in 1552 and it is known to have been in the possession of Matthew Parker from some time after that until his own death in 1575. Although Parker bequeathed most of his library to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, <b>the</b> <b>Cotton</b> manuscript was not included. By 1600, it was in the library of Lord Lumley and by 1621 the manuscript was in the possession of Robert Cotton. <b>The</b> <b>Cotton</b> library was moved in 1712 from Cotton House in Westminster to Essex House in the Strand and then moved again in 1730 to Ashburnham House in Westminster.

5|$|As silk was {{a luxury}} good, {{the market was}} small and easily {{saturated}} by machine produced goods. The next innovation in machine produced textiles came in <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> industry which had a much wider market and produced more affordable goods. Spinning cotton was a more complex process than silk production. The water frame for spinning cotton was developed by Richard Arkwright and patented in 1769. The machines could spin yarn continuously and replaced skilled workers with unskilled supervisors {{to make sure the}} machines didn't break. Water frames varied in size from 4 to 96spindles. For these reasons, the water frame became popular and widespread. In 1771, Richard Arkwright took a lease on land in Cromford. By 1774, his first mill was operational, and in 1776 he began construction of a second mill at Cromford. During this time, he developed machines for pre-spinning and in 1775 took out his second patent. With spinning mechanised, the other processes involved in producing cotton could not keep up and also required mechanisation. He produced a machine for carding, the process which laid out <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> fibres parallel, however not all his inventions were successful and cleaning <b>the</b> <b>cotton</b> was performed by hand until the 1790s when an effective machine was invented.|$|E
