40|$|This study {{defines a}} {{computational}} algorithm to calculate and evaluate thermal performances {{of a double}} skin façade (DSF). The definition of the algorithm, expressed in the unit Simulink of Matlab, has been obtained through: the physical-mathematical treatment of the air stream model and the thermal model; the solution of differential equations through the routine writing in Simulink; the simulations to evaluate the constructive parameters of DSF. The first simulations {{have been made in}} order to evaluate the ideal depth of a single cell of DSF [Lembo et al. 2007], placing a single tempered glass on the outer skin and a double glazing filled with argon on the interior skin. In the new simulations <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>glazing</b> has been exchanged for the internal double glazing (that is placing double glazing filled with argon on the outer skin and a single tempered glass on the interior skin). Analysing results we can say that efficiency of preheating η has increased up to 5. 6 % in winter, while solar factor g has increased up to 70 % in summer. Simulations has just demonstrated that we have no improvement changing the position of glazing with respect to the first simulations because the solar factor g increases a lot and the efficiency of preheating η increases a little...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{underfloor}} heating {{is getting more}} and more popular as a whole heating system for all premises not only the bathrooms. Share of underfloor heating compared to such traditional heating systems like radiators or air heating systems is increasing, thanks to better building envelope insulation level, need for higher comfort level and potential to use such modern energy sources like heat pumps that uses ground water, soil or air energy. Relatively low temperature in heating mode and high temperature in cooling mode and minimum temperature difference between supply and return allows to increase coeficient of perfomance (COP) of heat pump or efficiency of a gas condensation boiler. Often the architects and the customer are interested to install underfloor heating, but one of the main concerns is about thermal comfort next to glazed surfaces in residential buildings as well in office buildings. The aim of the paper is to analyse thermal comfort of people near <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>glazed</b> surfaces taking into account comparatively low outside calculation temperatures. Calculations where made based on the applicable European norms (EN). Seven different U-values for <b>outside</b> <b>glazed</b> surfaces where analysed at room temperature 200 C and outside temperature - 200 C, analysis include radiant asymmetry and downdraught calculations. Results shows that using outside surfaces with U-value below 1. 5 W/m 2 deg is acceptable to ensure thermal comfort according to European standarts...|$|R
40|$|The {{market share}} of triple heat {{insulating}} glazing has been increasing to ~ 60 % by now in Germany. Dew and frost on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> surface of such insulating glass units with U g values from 0. 4 to 1. 0 W/m 2 K installed as window glazing are a severe problem, because the free look-through {{being one of the}} essential functions of glazing is disturbed. This report describes the kay parameters influencing the occurrence. Therefore a realistic model of the stationary heat flow through glazing is established. From this parameter study it follows that frost can be avoided by adequate Low-E, but this does not hold for dew. Regarding dew, only the frequency of its occurrence can be diminished. The essential result of the study is that dew on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> surface of <b>glazing</b> cannot be avoided with any Low-E coating if the outdoor temperature exceeds the room temperature.

50|$|To {{keep the}} sun's heat {{out of the}} house, a low-emissivity coating should be applied to <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> pane of <b>glazed</b> windows. If the windows are {{designed}} to provide heat energy {{in the winter and}} keep heat inside the house (typical of cold climates), the low-emissivity coating should be applied to the inside pane of glazed windows. Such films also reduce the amount of visible and ultraviolet radiation entering a window, and are often applied to reduce fading of the contents of a room. Silvered film may also be employed to the same end. Spectrally selective films act by blocking certain wavelengths of the sun's infrared radiation and reject heat without reducing natural light.|$|R

The computer model was used in conjunction with measured lux data to establish the base case light exposure and the effect of the control measures. Light control was implemented through the use of darker paint finishes on the walls and ceiling, which reduced the amount of reflected light reaching Hambletonian;; and the addition of a mesh screen to <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> <b>glazed</b> dome above the painting.

40|$|ASME 2010 International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, IMECE 2010, Vancouver, BC, 12 - 18 November 2010 There are {{concerns}} on the behaviour of glass façade under a big fire. Real-scale experiments on a single-skin façade {{were carried out}} at a large laboratory of a sizable aluminum manufacturing plant in Southern China. Burning behaviour of a three-storey high single-skin glass façade with double glazing due to an adjacent big room fire was studied. Part of the façade of width 12 m and height 13 m was installed in a testing tower. A glass pane of the façade was taken out with a model fire chamber placed next to the opening. Flashover in the chamber {{was set up by}} burning a 2 MW gasoline fire. Flame and smoke spread from the chamber would move up along the glass façade. Air temperature <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>glazing</b> above the fire chamber was measured. It is observed that flame spread out of the opening will be attached to the upper levels. The glass façade at that level will be heated up and broken. Flame can spread to the room at the upper level. Another flashover fire will then occur with adequate air supply. This scenario on having a post-flashover fire in an adjacent upper room should be included in hazard assessment in buildings with glass façade.

40|$|The {{market share}} of {{thermally}} insulating, triple glazing installed as window glazing increased to nearly 50 % in Germany in 2011 and is continuing to rise in 2012. Dew and frost on the outdoor surface of insulating glazing units with thermal transmittance values U-g below 1. 0 W/(m(2) K) present a severe problem, because unimpeded visual contact, one of the essential features of glazing, is disturbed. The report describes calculation methods to determine the occurrence and prevention of outdoor condensation and the key parameters influencing it. From this parameter study, it follows that condensation on the outdoor surface of window glazing {{in the form of}} frost and dew is prevented for all the glazing by low-emissivity (low-e) coatings with a certain thermal emissivity value epsilon(o) between 0 and 1 on the outdoor surface if the outdoor air temperature t(o) is lower than the room temperature t(i), normally given for buildings in the Central European climate when outdoor condensation occurs. However, today weather resistant low-e coatings with sufficient transmittance applied on outdoor surfaces of window glazing can only be manufactured on the basis of indium tin oxide with epsilon(o) approximate to 0. 2. The study shows that with such low-e coatings frost can be prevented as well as the frequency of dew occurrence can be reduced on all vertically installed glazing with thermal transmittance values U-g >= 0. 47 W/(m(2) K) and on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of skylight <b>glazing</b> with U-g >= 0. 70 W/(m(2) K). This is sufficient for all window glazing marketed nowadays. Weather-resistant, cost-effective coatings on glass with epsilon(o) < 0. 2, which are required for energy-neutral glazing with U-g values < 0. 5 W/(m(2) K), are the subject of ongoing development...|$|R
40|$|There are {{concerns}} {{on the behavior}} of glass façade under a big fire in tall buildings. As reported, flame ejected from a compartment fire would spread up to high levels and ignite combustibles in there. The fire source would then jump up the tall building one floor by one floor, giving a "jumping fire scenario. " Real-scale experiments were carried out at a big laboratory in Southern China to confirm this identified scenario. Part of a single skin façade with double glazing of height 7. 5 m was burned. A fire was set up in an adjacent compartment and the glass pane of the façade next to the chamber was taken out. Flashover in the chamber was onsetted by setting up a gasoline pool fire. Another pool of same size and amount of gasoline was put in a chamber in the upper level above the first chamber. The adjacent glass pane next to the upper chamber was not removed. Upon igniting the pool fire at the lower chamber, flame spread out from the opening to act at the glazing system. Glass pane at the upper level was broken, igniting the gasoline pool in the upper chamber and onsetting another flashover fire. Flame then spread out from that upper chamber. The process would repeat if there are combustibles stored at the upper levels. Air temperature <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>glazing</b> above the fire chamber was measured and will be reported in this article. This scenario with fires jumping up one by one was justified from results on the measured air temperatures. This identified scenario of having fire sources jumping up in sequence along the façade is confirmed and should be investigated. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
