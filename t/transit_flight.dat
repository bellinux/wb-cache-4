2500|$|Construction of Macon {{commenced}} at the Goodyear Airdock in October 1931, once Akron {{had been}} {{handed over the}} US Navy. She was christened on 11 March 1933 by the wife of Rear Admiral Moffett, before undertaking her first flight trial on 21 April. Macon was commissioned on 23 June, before departing for Lakehurst the same day. On 7 July, while cruising along Long Island Sound, the ship's air group came aboard for the first time. On 12 October, the ship departed Lakehurst for the <b>transit</b> <b>flight</b> to NAS Moffett Field in California, which was planned as the ship's permanent home base. Between November 1933 and January 1934, Macon undertook a number of exercises with the fleet, being [...] "shot down" [...] on many occasions by both carrier-based aircraft and anti-aircraft fire. In May, the ship returned to the east coast {{to participate in the}} 1934 fleet problem. In July, she undertook a training mission that included an attempt to intercept a pair of cruisers, including , which was taking President Roosevelt on vacation to Hawaii. For the remainder of 1934, the ship undertook a number of exercises, including the first use of new tactics that saw the ship used as an aircraft carrier, with its aircraft undertaking the reconnaissance mission. In this exercise, aircraft from Macon were able to locate the aircraft carrier [...] and keep her under surveillance for several hours. Macon was also able to show her versatility by being able to mark the position of the crews of two aircraft lost at sea until they could be rescued. In early 1935, the ship participated in further exercises until, on 12 February, while returning to Moffett Field, having lost one of her stabilisers, she made a forced landing in the sea off Point Sur, sinking with the loss of two of her crew.|$|E

50|$|In 1983, {{the first}} {{terminal}} stopped working, {{due to the}} opening of the new one and from September until October, the airport was accepting the <b>transit</b> <b>flights</b> from and to Chita, due to its closing, because of the runway re-construction.

50|$|On a <b>transit</b> <b>flight</b> (getting {{to or from}} {{a display}} location) the team may fly at the {{relatively}} low altitude of 1000 ft. This avoids the complication of moving though the cloud base in formation, and also avoids much controlled air space. Jets are more efficient at higher altitude, so longer flights are made at 35000 to 42000 ft. On transit flights, the formation can include spare planes. Sometimes a C-130 Hercules accompanies them, carrying spare parts.|$|E

A newly manufactured Su-9 which was in <b>transit</b> <b>flight</b> happened to be near Powers' U-2. The Su-9 was unarmed and was directed to ram the U-2. One ramming attempt was made and the Su-9 missed the U-2, primarily due to large difference in the speed of the two planes. No further ramming attempt was made due to Su-9's lack of fuel.|$|E

A combined fleet emerged, including STOL capable de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters with some Twin Otters being operated as float planes.

The new boom structure was much stronger and of simpler design. Evaluation by the SVK (Seeflugzeugs-Versuchs-Kommando - Seaplane Testing Command), was carried out from 23 to 26 June 1917 testing various engine off configurations and water-borne handling.

Whole air {{samples were collected}} aboard the NCAR Electra aircraft platform during the Monsoon Experiment (MONEX) flights in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and on ferry flights {{to and from the}} United States. Foliage emission rates were also measured on some tropical plants. The average free tropospheric TNMHC (total non-methane hydrocarbon) levels from both the <b>transit</b> <b>flight</b> and mission flights were low (2. 5 pg/m 3). TNMHC just above the forest canopy over Borneo but within the mixing layer was higher and the concentrations over land were higher than those obtained over the ocean. The fluorocarbons showed a small latitude gradient or a difference between continental and oceanic air masses or (possibily) both. Methyl chloroform also showed a significant latitude profile. Nitrous oxide was uniformly distributed in the atmosphere. The C, hydrocarbons, ethane and acetylene, also showed latitudinal gradients. The emission rates of foliage in the tropics were higher than those reported by other investigators for the mid-latitudes. The species sampled indicated that most tropical vegetation emits predominantly isoprene, rather than terpenes...|$|E

I used radar, theodolite, and video to study OOF by Pacific dunlins (Calidris alpina pacifica) wintering at Boundary Bay, British Columbia. OOF occurred only during daytime high-tides, and did not occur in darkness. Its mean duration was 187 ± 80 (SD) min, shortened in relation to daily temperature, and {{did not take place}} when ice in the bay facilitated roosting far from shore.

OOF flight had much gliding (14 %) and was close to the minimum power speed, while <b>transit</b> <b>flights</b> between foraging sites had little gliding (1 %) and was much faster than the maximum-range speed.
