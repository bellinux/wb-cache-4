25|$|For each purchase, {{the bank}} charges the {{merchant}} a commission (discount fee) for this service {{and there may}} be a certain delay before the agreed payment is received by the merchant. The commission is often a percentage of the <b>transaction</b> <b>amount,</b> plus a fixed fee (interchange rate).|$|E
25|$|These {{fees are}} {{typically}} from 1 to 6 percent of each sale, but will vary {{not only from}} merchant to merchant (large merchants can negotiate lower rates), but also from card to card, with business cards and rewards cards generally costing the merchants more to process. The interchange fee that applies to a particular transaction is also affected by many other variables including: the type of merchant, the merchant's total card sales volume, the merchant's average <b>transaction</b> <b>amount,</b> whether the cards were physically present, how the information required for the transaction was received, the specific type of card, when the transaction was settled, and the authorized and settled transaction amounts. In some cases, merchants add a surcharge to the credit cards to cover the interchange fee, encouraging their customers to instead use cash, debit cards, or even cheques.|$|E
25|$|Merchants that accept {{credit cards}} must pay {{interchange}} fees and discount fees on all credit-card transactions. In some cases merchants are barred by their credit agreements from passing these fees directly to credit card customers, or from setting a minimum <b>transaction</b> <b>amount</b> (no longer prohibited in the United States, United Kingdom or Australia). The {{result is that}} merchants are induced to charge all customers (including {{those who do not}} use credit cards) higher prices to cover the fees on credit card transactions. The inducement can be strong because the merchant's fee is a percentage of the sale price, which has a disproportionate effect on the profitability of businesses that have predominantly credit card transactions, unless compensated for by raising prices generally. In the United States in 2008 credit card companies collected a total of $48 billion in interchange fees, or an average of $427 per family, with an average fee rate of about 2% per transaction.|$|E

40|$|Trust {{evaluation}} {{is critical to}} peer-to-peer (P 2 P) e-commerce environments. Traditionally the evaluation process is based on other peers' recommendations neglecting <b>transaction</b> <b>amounts.</b> This {{may lead to the}} bias in transaction trust evaluation and risk the new transaction. The weakness may be exploited by dishonest sellers to obtain good transaction reputation by selling cheap goods and then cheat buyers by selling expensive goods. In this paper we present a novel model for transaction trust evaluation, which differentiates <b>transaction</b> <b>amounts</b> when computing trust values. The trust {{evaluation is}} dependent on <b>transaction</b> history, the <b>amounts</b> of old <b>transactions,</b> and the <b>amount</b> of the new transaction. Therefore, the trust value can be taken as the risk indication of the forthcoming transaction and is valuable for the decision-making of buyers. 24 page(s...|$|R
40|$|As {{peer-to-peer}} (P 2 P) e-commerce environments lack central management, {{prior to}} new transactions with an unknown peer, the trust evaluation becomes {{a very important}} concern, which relies on the transaction history data. Traditionally the evaluation process is based on other peers' recommendations neglecting <b>transaction</b> <b>amounts.</b> This {{may lead to the}} bias to the transaction trust evaluation and risk the new transaction, which may occur between unknown peers. This paper presents a novel model for transaction trust evaluation, which distinguishes <b>transaction</b> <b>amounts</b> and thus computes different impact factors when analyzing old transactions and computing trust values. As a result, the trust evaluation becomes more accurate, which is dependant on <b>transaction</b> history, the <b>amounts</b> of old <b>transactions,</b> the <b>amount</b> of the new transaction, and the temporal dimension. Therefore the obtained trust value can be taken as the risk indication of the forthcoming transaction. 8 page(s...|$|R
2500|$|Another way {{to provide}} TANs to an online banking user is to send the TAN of the current bank {{transaction}} to the user's (GSM) mobile phone via SMS.

40|$|Personalised, location-related and {{differentiated}} {{services in}} the mobile digital economy create a demand for suitable pricing models. In the case of disaggregated “microservices” (e. g., small digitalized information or service units), {{as well as for}} the acquisition of low-value physical goods, the deployment of micropayments seems appropriate. This paper analyzes the economic efficiency of marginal <b>transaction</b> <b>amounts</b> in the m-commerce area by applying the theoretical approach of transaction cost economics. For this purpose, a separation of technical and cognitive transaction costs is applied. The influence of selected determinants such as specifity, uncertainty and bounded rationality on transaction costs in mobile commerce micropayments is analyzed. The result is a more likely application of micropayments for physical goods such as beverages or parking tickets than for digital goods and services, given the theoretical assumptions of the model. In addition, indicators for a significant above-zero lower limit of <b>transaction</b> <b>amounts</b> in mobile commerce are presented...|$|R

50|$|If {{the account}} holder's {{computer}} hosts malware, the smart card security model may be broken. Malware can override the communication (both input via keyboard and output via application screen) between the user and the application. Man-in-the-browser malware (e.g., the Trojan Silentbanker) could modify a transaction, unnoticed by the user. Banks like Fortis and Belfius in Belgium and Rabobank ("random reader") in the Netherlands combine a smart card with an unconnected card reader {{to avoid this}} problem. The customer enters a challenge received from the bank's website, a PIN and the <b>transaction</b> <b>amount</b> into the reader, The reader returns an 8-digit signature. This signature is manually entered into the personal computer and verified by the bank, preventing point-of-sale-malware from changing the <b>transaction</b> <b>amount.</b>|$|E
