40|$|Travelling {{through several}} time zones {{results in a}} {{constellation}} of symptoms known as jet lag. These include reduced alertness, daytime fatigue, loss of appetite, reduced cognitive skills, and disruptions to sleep/wakefulness and other circadian rhythms. In susceptible air travel passengers, jet lag may exacerbate affective illness ans result in psychiatric morbidity. It is suggested that dysregulation of circadian rhythms and melatonin secretion represents the common underlying factor in jet lag and other circadian disorders. Hence the effective management of jet lag requires timely application of the well known chronobiotic melatonin. Recent studies have {{emphasized the importance of}} strategically timed administrations of melatonin and appropriate limited exposure to environmental schedules. However, with the introduction of the melatonergic agonists such as ramelteon and <b>tasimelteon,</b> which have both a strong affinity for MT 1 and MT 2 melatonin receptors and a longer half life, a new therapeutic option now exists for treating the sleep disturbances associated with jet lag.

40|$|Abstract: From a {{physiological}} perspective the sleep-wake cycle can be envisioned as {{a sequence of}} three physiological states (wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement, NREM, sleep and REM sleep) which are defined by a particular neuroendocrine-immune profile regulating the metabolic balance, body weight and inflammatory responses. Sleep deprivation and circadian disruption in contemporary “ 24 / 7 Society” lead to the predominance of pro-orexic and proinflammatory mechanisms that contribute to a pandemic metabolic syndrome (MS) including obesity, diabetes and atherosclerotic disease. Thus, a successful management of MS may require a drug that besides antagonizing the trigger factors of MS could also correct a disturbed sleep-wake rhythm. This review deals with {{the analysis of the}} therapeutic validity of melatonin in MS. Melatonin is an effective chronobiotic agent changing the phase and amplitude of the sleep/wake rhythm and having cytoprotective and immunomodulatory properties useful to prevent a number of MS sequels. Several studies support that melatonin can prevent hyperadiposity in animal models of obesity. Melatonin at a low dose (2 ‐ 5 mg/day) has been used for improving sleep in patients with insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. More recently, attention has been focused on the development of potent melatonin analogs with prolonged effects (ramelteon, agomelatine, <b>tasimelteon,</b> TK 301). In clinical trials these analogs were employed in doses considerably higher than those usually employed for melatonin. In view that the relative potencies of the analogs are higher than that of the natural compound, clinical trials employing melatonin doses in the range of 50 - 100 mg/day are needed to assess its therapeutic value in MS...|$|E
40|$|Several {{aspects of}} human {{physiology}} and behavior are dominated by 24 -h circadian rhythms with key impacts on health and well-being. These include mainly the sleep–wake cycle, vigilance and performance patterns, and some hormone secretions. The rhythms are generated spontaneously by an internal “pacemaker,” the suprachiasmatic nuclei within the anterior hypothalamus. This master clock has, for most humans, an intrinsic rhythm slightly longer than 24 [*]h. Daily retinal light exposure {{is necessary for the}} synchronization of the circadian rhythms with the external 24 -h solar environment. This daily synchronization process generally poses no problems for sighted individuals except in the context of jetlag or working night shifts being conditions of circadian desynchrony. However, many blind subjects with no light perception had periodical circadian desynchrony, in the absence of light information to the master clock leading to poor circadian rhythm synchronization. Affected patients experience cyclical or periodic episodes of poor sleep and daytime dysfunction, severely interfering with social, academic, and professional life. The diagnosis of Non- 24 Sleep–Wake Rhythm Disorder, also named free-running disorder, non-entrained disorder, or hypernycthemeral syndrome, remains challenging from a clinical point of view due to the cyclical symptoms and should be confirmed by measurements of circadian biomarkers such as urinary melatonin to demonstrate a circadian period outside the normal range.

40|$|The {{circadian}} {{nature of}} melatonin (MLT) secretion, {{coupled with the}} localization of MLT receptors to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, has led to numerous studies {{of the role of}} MLT in modulation of the sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythms in humans. Although much more needs to be understood about the various functions exerted by MLT and its mechanisms of action, three therapeutic agents (ramelteon, prolonged-release MLT, and agomelatine) are already in use, and MLT receptor agonists are now appearing as new promising treatment options for sleep and circadian-rhythm related disorders. In this review, emphasis has been placed on medicinal chemistry strategies leading to MLT receptor agonists, and on the evidence supporting therapeutic efficacy of compounds undergoing clinical evaluation. A wide range of clinical trials demonstrated that ramelteon, prolonged-release MLT and <b>tasimelteon</b> have sleep-promoting effects, providing an important treatment option for insomnia and transient insomnia, even if the improvements of sleep maintenance appear moderate. Well-documented effects of agomelatine suggest that this MLT agonist offers an attractive alternative for the treatment of depression, combining efficacy with a favorable side effect profile. Despite a large number of high affinity nonselective MLT receptor agonists, only limited data on MT 1 or MT 2 subtype-selective compounds are available up to now. Administration of the MT 2 -selective agonist IIK 7 to rats has proved to decrease NREM sleep onset latency, suggesting that MT 2 receptor subtype is involved in the acute sleep-promoting action of MLT; rigorous clinical studies are needed to demonstrate this hypothesis. Further clinical candidates based on selective activation of MT 1 or MT 2 receptors are expected in coming years...|$|E
