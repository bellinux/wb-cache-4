5|$|When he was five, Kanae and {{his mother}} joined Ichirō in Tokyo and settled in a <b>tenement</b> <b>house</b> in the San'ya area. His mother did sewing work to help support the family, and with her sister Tama {{provided}} maid service to the Mori household, and thus Kanae often met his younger cousin, Kaita Murayama, who, like Kanae, {{was to make a}} career in art. The painter Harada Naojirō, whom Ōgai had befriended when the two were studying in Germany, asked Kanae's mother, whom he had seen at the Mori household, to model for the painting Kannon Bodhisattva Riding the Dragon of 1890. Such occurrences may have contributed to attracting Kanae to art.|$|E

5|$|Sienkiewicz {{was born}} on 5 May 1846 in Wola Okrzejska, now a village in {{the central part of}} eastern Polish region of Lubelskie, then part of the Russian Empire. His family were impoverished Polish nobles, on his father's side {{deriving}} from Tatars who had settled in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. His parents were Józef Sienkiewicz (1813–96) and Stefania, née Cieciszowska (1820–73). He had five siblings: an older brother, Kazimierz (died during January Uprising), and four sisters, Aniela, Helena, Zofia and Maria. His family were entitled to use the Polish Oszyk coat of arms. Wola Okrzejska belonged to the writer's maternal grandmother, Felicjana Cieciszowska. His family moved several times, and young Henryk spent his childhood on family estates in Grabowce Górne, Wężyczyn and Burzec. In September 1858 he began his education in Warsaw, where the family would finally settle in 1861, having bought a <b>tenement</b> <b>house</b> (kamienica) in eastern Warsaw's Praga district. He received relatively poor school grades except in the humanities, notably Polish language and history.|$|E

Paine conveyed it to Samuel Whipple who resided in the house {{until his death in}} 1711. Upon his death the house was recorded as having a two-story lean-to. Whipple transferred the property to his wife and upon her death, which passed to their daughters Abigail and Hope Whipple. Hope Whipple would marry Robert Currie and upon her death, Robert Currie would marry her sister Abigail Whipple, and upon her death fell to Robert Currie's ownership. In 1737, Currie sold the house to William Smith, Job Whipple and John Whipple. It remained in the Whipple family until 1761 when it was sold to Captain Joseph Owen. The house would take its final name, the Abbott House, from Thomas Abbott who married Joseph Owen's daughter and resided in the house until his death in 1826. The Mowry Tavern was allegedly one of only five buildings not burned by the Indians during King Philip's War. It is believed that it was spared because Roger Williams, a friend of the Indians, held Christian worship services in the building. The house was located on Abbott Street adjacent to the North Burial Ground. The entire structure was demolished in 1900 to construct a triple decker <b>tenement</b> <b>house.</b> At the time of its demolition, it was the oldest house in Providence.|$|E

At the age of 15, in 1884, Moishe's father, Benjamin Hillkowitz, lost his factory in Riga and decided to leave for America to improve the family's financial situation.

25|$|In Europe, the Intelligentsia existed as {{a status}} class (social stratum) before the coinage {{of the term}} intelligentsia (the intellectuals) in the 19th century. In their status-class functions, the intellectuals were {{associated}} with the cultural development of cities, the dissemination of printed knowledge (books, texts, newspapers), and the economic development of rental-housing (the <b>tenement</b> <b>house)</b> for the teacher, the journalist, and the civil servant. As people whose professions placed them (physically, economically, and socially) outside the traditional places and functions of the town-and-country monarchic social-classes (royalty, aristocracy, bourgeoisie) of the time, the intelligentsia were an urban social-class.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} law as {{normative}} patterns in a normative field {{was developed by}} Anna Christensen {{in a number of}} published articles following the book Residential Right in the <b>Tenement</b> <b>House</b> (1994). The theory is based on the thesis that different basic normative patterns can be distinguished in the multitude of legal norms. As social life is quite complex, these normative patterns do not make up the ‘hierarchical legal system’ we frequently imagine. Instead, these patterns are being set into play in a normative field as determined by the different basic patterns, which also act as normative poles. Another component of the theoretical framework is the functional relationship between the legal system and the structure of society and conditions of economic production, elaborated in the work of Professor Ann Numhauser-Henning. The basic normative patterns are held to reflect normative practices functional to society and human relationships. They thus reflect – and codify – social normative conceptions and practices aimed at making long-lasting human relationships and sustainable societies possible, and they are closely related to societal conditions. Changes in the underlying conditions of production provide explanations for many of the movements in the normative field and the new legal institutions, which have arisen to satisfy fundamental normative demands. However, the basic normative patterns all represent enduring legitimate normative conceptions in society, and it is the task of legislators and courts to balance these conceptions within the framework of law.|$|E

2500|$|Christensen’s {{interest}} in normative developments continued over the years, {{and in the}} study Residential Right in the <b>Tenement</b> <b>House</b> (Hemrätt i hyreshuset), 1994, she took the first steps towards creating the Theory of Law as Normative Patterns in a Normative Field. [...] The theme {{of the study was}} the social security of tenancy and the residential rights in the <b>tenement</b> <b>house.</b> According to Christensen, this was a legal study, mainly conducted with a legal-dogmatic method and based on traditional legal materials, but the aim of the study went further than describing the precise content of the legal rules at a given moment. Instead, Christensen wanted to reveal underlying norms constituting society; Christensen explains how the rules on security of tenancy had developed in a field between two normative poles – one being the right to property of the owner, the other being the residential right in the <b>tenement</b> <b>house.</b> [...] The study, as well as the article ‘Protection of Established Position, a Basic Normative Pattern’ that was published in 1996, reflect the emphasis on historical and normative developments that characterized Anna Christensen’s research.|$|E
