40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} a {{literary}} analysis of the {{collection of short stories}} by an American-Dominican author Junot Díaz. The central subject of his work Drown is the problematic of immigration mainly from the Dominican Republic to the United States. This diploma thesis is focused on a detailed study of the alienting consequences caused by the uprooting of characters from their Dominican culture and nation {{but at the same time}} by the effort to assimilate with the new culture, in this case with the culture of the United States. Each of the ten stories of the collection of short stories Drown is separately evaluated and subsequently the possible causes of the alienation are deduced. Alienation is not only restricted to the culture and nation, but it also plays an important role in considering conflicts within the family members. Secondly, the thesis analyses the matter of not being able to adapt to the new environment. For a broader scope of all the probable causes and manifestations of the alienation, another three short stories by Junot Díaz published in <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Time</b> are added to for the analysis. Junot Díaz repeatedly mentions some of the poingnant historical events of the Dominican Republic. For better orientation, the brief history of the Dominican Republic as well as the major points of the U. S. -Dominican relations are included in this diploma thesis.

40|$|Inspired on {{the works}} of {{scholars}} and activists that had denounced state repression of political activists in the United States, this research explores the theoretical proposal about the criminalization of political dissidence. The proposal of the criminalization of political dissidence is analyzed through {{the study of the}} case of Puerto Rican pro-independence organization Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional, F. A. L. N. ^ The subjects of this research were charged with seditious conspiracy and other charges. They claimed the status of prisoners of war and deny the jurisdiction of US courts over them. Affirming their right to fight for the independence of Puerto Rico, these individuals were treated by the state and the media as criminals and terrorists, as a menace to society at large. The clash of visions and discourses inspires this research. Moreover, the contribution and role of the media to the criminalization process is explored. ^ The methodology used is Altheide 2 ̆ 7 s ethnographic content analysis. By this documents are analyzed in a qualitative, deep manner, taking into consideration the whole spectrum of social and historical factors that defines the conjuncture. Court decisions, trial transcripts, and other legal documents are studied {{in order to understand the}} legal treatment of the case. Furthermore, the coverage by <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Time</b> and the Chicago Tribune of the violent incidents and the arrests is also studied to explore media 2 ̆ 7 s treatment to the same issue. ^ This research revealed that the FALN members were the subjects of a process of criminalization. Their case further demonstrates that the criminalization of political dissidence comprises three main elements. First, the characterization or stigmatization of political dissident groups as criminals and terrorist—the law and the media present images of the political groups and its members as criminal and terrorists. Second, the law and the media in its treatment to the dissident groups de-politicize their activities by negating importance or criticizing their political motivations or goals. The third element is the use of fear to justify social control, in other words the law and the media present images of possible danger to the public in order to justify mechanisms of social control. ...|$|E
