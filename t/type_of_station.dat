500|$|In 1930, Holden and Pick made {{a tour of}} Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden to see {{the latest}} {{developments}} in modern architecture. The UERL was planning extensions of the Piccadilly line to the west, north-west and north of London, and a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>station</b> was wanted. Adapting the architectural styles he had seen on the tour, Holden created functional designs composed of simple forms: cylinders, curves and rectangles, built in plain brick, concrete and glass. The extensions to the west and north-west were over existing routes operated by the District line and required a number of stations to be rebuilt to accommodate additional tracks or to replace original, basic buildings. Sudbury Town, the first station to be rebuilt in 1931, formed a template for many of the other new stations that followed: a tall rectangular brick box with a concrete flat roof and panels of vertical glazing to allow light into the interior. The Grade II* listed building was described by Pevsner as [...] "an outstanding example of how satisfying such unpretentious buildings can be, purely through the use of careful details and good proportions." ...|$|E

50|$|In many ways, remote base {{stations}} controlled by radio, resemble repeaters with additional features. Remote {{base stations}} are usually run and maintained by individual hobbyists or clubs.

However, the oblast governing board did not approve of the plans, and some time before the grand opening of the station, the architectural details were taken off, to be replaced with a more standard <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
50|$|Point Reyes Lifeboat Station, {{also known}} as Point Reyes Lifeboat Rescue Station, was built in 1927 by the United States Lifesaving Service (precursor to the United States Coast Guard).

50|$|Krasnye Vorota {{was one of}} Moscow's {{first four}} deep-level stations, {{and one of the}} first two to employ a three-arched design with three parallel, {{circular}} tunnels. In this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>station,</b> the outer tubes (which house the tracks and platforms) are separated from the larger central hall by heavy pylons. This design was planned to be used for the first time on the four central-city stations on the first Metro line, Krasnye Vorota, Chistye Prudy, Lubyanka, and Okhotnyi Ryad. However, due to construction difficulties a simpler two-arched design was implemented at Lubyanka or Chistye Prudy.|$|E
50|$|Overall, VA - {{mile post}} 75.6 (9/6/1880): Originally this station was named Milford. Overall gets {{its name from}} the Overall family, large landowners at one time. One of the members of this family was Col. William C. Overall, who owned hundred of acres of land in that section. Today, there is a high trestle called Milford Bridge over where the town sign is on Route 340.

5000|$|The GMRS-only {{channels}} are defined in pairs, with one frequency in the 462 MHz range for simplex and repeater outputs, {{and another in}} the 467 MHz frequency range for repeater inputs. There are eight channels exclusively for GMRS and seven [...] "interstitial" [...] channels shared with Family Radio Service. GMRS use requires an FCC license, and licensees are permitted to transmit at up to 50 watts on GMRS frequencies, depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>station,</b> but 1 to 5 watts is more common. Units are allowed to have detachable or external antennas.|$|E

50|$|Within the network, existed {{not only}} a {{teletype}} net, but a bearing net, which could be accessed from telephone anywhere in network. Stations were classified as ether regional or main intercept stations. Stations were equipped with long wave and in some stations, short wave direction finding sets. In peacetime there was practically no difference in each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>station.</b> In times of war, it was the responsibility of so-called Regional Major Intercept stations, those stations at Neumünster, Wilhelmshaven, Kiel and Swinemuende, to keep informed naval commanders of all relevant information specific to their area. In 1942, Naval Radio Intelligence and Naval Radio Station was dropped The intercept stations were re-designated as Navy Main Bearing Station.|$|E
50|$|Developers {{and local}} {{residents}} created {{a petition to}} construct the shell, fearing that {{the opportunity for a}} station would be lost once tunnel excavation was completed. In June 2010, the city announced it was seeking funding to assess the feasibility of constructing the station at a later date, using a two-platform, two-entrance model without an underground connecting passage. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>station,</b> while common in Manhattan, is not considered ideal by the MTA, but would nonetheless be acceptable were funding eventually found. The planned entrances would still be located two blocks apart due to the location's depth—with the westbound entrance on 42nd Street and the eastbound entrance on 40th Street—but the new plan only called for one exit in each direction.|$|E
