5|$|Work on the {{plutonium}} core {{had to wait}} until Windscale delivered sufficient product, which was not until late 1951. The uranium tamper proved more of a challenge for the metallurgists than anticipated, due to a shortage of machine tools and moulds, and difficulty with the vacuum furnace. The first spheres were cast in December 1951, and while they were spherical to within , there were some casting defects, and it was feared they would hinder the implosion process. The defects were repaired, and two castings were prepared for Operation Hurricane. Work on plutonium chemistry and metallurgy was carried out at Harwell, as the hot laboratory at Aldermaston was not completed until May 1952. The first plutonium billet was cast there from plutonium nitrate from the Chalk River Laboratories in 1951. The metallurgists chose <b>to</b> <b>alloy</b> {{the plutonium}} with gallium to stabilise it in the malleable δ phase allotrope. Not until the first billet arrived from Harwell in 1951 were they able to confirm that this was practical. The first plutonium at Aldermaston was cast in an argon atmosphere in a cerium sulphide crucible.|$|E

25|$|From October 1995, the V6 {{models were}} simply {{known as the}} Vienta—losing the Camry {{identity}} altogether. The availability of manual transmission on the CSi and Touring Series V6 sedan variants coincided with the update, while the V6 Grande superseded the V6 Ultima. Perforated leather upholstery and wood grain trim on the Grande was optional. Towards {{the end of the}} model run, special edition Getaway (October 1996) and Intrigue (April 1997) sedan models were launched. Based on the CSi, the Getaway was further equipped with 14-inch alloy wheels, a CD player and air conditioning. Also based on the CSi, the Intrigue added air conditioning, CD player, Jacquard upholstery, extra seat-back map pockets, and 15-inch wheels.

Afterward considerations presented themselves <b>to</b> <b>alloy</b> my rapture, but for that moment, as I say, it was nothing but rapture.

I don't remember just the terms I used in doing this, but they seemed satisfactory to Kendricks; probably a repetition of the letters of the alphabet would have been equally acceptable.
