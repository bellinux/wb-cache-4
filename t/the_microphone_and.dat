5|$|On June 29, 2007, CMLL's annual Gran Alternativa tournament {{took place}} at Arena Mexico. Guerrero teamed up with Euforia, but the team was {{defeated}} by Místico and his partner La Sombra. After the loss Guerrero publicly asked Dr. Wagner, Jr. to join him for a challenge to Místico and Negro Casas for the CMLL Tag Team Championship. The match was held on July 13, 2007 at Arena Mexico and saw Guerrero and Wagner win the championship. A week later Guerrero and Wagner lost the titles back to Místico and Casas, making the team the shortest reigning CMLL World Tag Team Champions ever. The loss caused the two fighting in mutual accusations of betrayal, which in turn led to a feud between the two wrestlers. On July 27, at Arena Mexico, Dr. Wagner, Jr. and Místico held a mano a mano match which was decided by a treacherous intervention by Guerrero, who climbed into the ring, attacked Wagner from behind and caused him to lose the match, then the aftermath, Guerrero ripped off Wagner's mask. On August 3, 2007, Guerrero teamed up with Atlantis and Sangre Azteca against Dr. Wagner Jr., Alex Koslov and Volador Jr. at Arena México after the match Guerrero took <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> challenged Wagner for a mask versus mask match but no match ever came of it as Dr. Wagner, Jr. left CMLL shortly after. In 2008 Último Guerrero teamed with newcomer Dragón Rojo Jr. to win the 2008 Gran Alternativa tournament.|$|E

25|$|Windscreens (or {{windshields}} – {{the terms}} are interchangeable) {{provide a method}} of reducing the effect of wind on microphones. While pop-screens give protection from unidirectional blasts, foam “hats” shield wind into the grille from all directions, and blimps / zeppelins / baskets entirely enclose <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> protect its body as well. The latter is important because, given the extreme low frequency content of wind noise, vibration induced in the housing of the microphone can contribute substantially to the noise output.|$|E

25|$|The match {{saw the two}} grapplers exchanging leglocks {{without any}} decisive movement. Following a barrage of light blows by Silveira Sakuraba dropped for a low single leg takedown, but referee John McCarthy stopped the fight before Sakuraba could {{complete}} it, believing he had been knocked out by the punches. A loud protest followed from the crowd and an angry Sakuraba attempted unsuccessfully to take <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> address the Japanese audience. However, after reviewing tape, McCarthy changed his decision to a no-contest. As Tank Abbott, who had earlier defeated Anjoh, had dropped from the tournament due to an injured hand, it was ruled that Sakuraba and Silveira faced off once more that night in {{what would be the}} championship bout of the tournament.|$|E

25|$|Rising {{tensions}} in Zaiko between the frontman and the instrumentalists {{led to their}} decision in 1975 to oust Evoloko and the singers in favour of Ombalie and Nyoka. Ombale became the creative heart of Zaiko, writing numerous songs and fronting the band in Nyoka Longo. Zaiko continued their success, {{and many of the}} former singers returned to the band. However, a developing rivalry between Ombale and singer Mashakado Mbuta over band leadership came to a head {{at the end of the}} year during a live performance on Zairian national television. The two singers fought on air for <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> refused to sing and dance at each other songs. Mashakado Mbuta left the band in 1976 to join Yoka Lokole.|$|E
25|$|Stating the {{efficiency}} of wind noise reduction is an inexact science, since the effect varies enormously with frequency, and hence with the bandwidth of <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> audio channel. At very low frequencies (10–100Hz) where massive wind energy exists, reductions are important to avoid overloading of the audio chain – particularly the early stages. This can produce the typical “wumping” sound associated with wind, which is often syllabic muting of the audio due to LF peak limiting. At higher frequencies – 200Hz to ~3kHz – the aural sensitivity curve allows us to hear the effect of wind as an addition to the normal noise floor, {{even though it has}} a far lower energy content. Simple shields may allow the wind noise to be 10dB less apparent; better ones can achieve nearer to a 50dB reduction. However the acoustic transparency, particularly at HF, should also be indicated, since a very high level of wind attenuation could be associated with very muffled audio.|$|E
25|$|On March 17, 1997, Hart {{was given}} a shot to regain the title against Sid in a steel cage and thus change the main event at WrestleMania. If Hart won, his match with Austin at WrestleMania would become a title match while if Sid won, the {{regularly}} scheduled title match pitting him against the Undertaker would go on as planned. Since their respective matches would be affected, both Undertaker and Austin interfered in the match with Austin trying to help Hart so he could wrestle for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and Undertaker trying to help Sid so he could keep his championship opportunity. Sid won the match by escaping the cage after Undertaker slammed the door in Hart's face as {{he was trying to}} exit. While the steel cage was being dismantled, Vince McMahon attempted to interview Hart, but a furious Hart grabbed <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> shoved McMahon down the mat before yelling expletives at him.|$|E

25|$|The inner {{elements}} of a microphone are {{the primary source of}} differences in directivity. A pressure microphone uses a diaphragm between a fixed internal volume of air and the environment, and responds uniformly to pressure from all directions, so it is said to be omnidirectional. A pressure-gradient microphone uses a diaphragm that is at least partially open on both sides. The pressure difference between the two sides produces its directional characteristics. Other elements such as the external shape of <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> external devices such as interference tubes can also alter a microphone's directional response. A pure pressure-gradient microphone is equally sensitive to sounds arriving from front or back, but insensitive to sounds arriving from the side because sound arriving at the front and back at the same time creates no gradient between the two. The characteristic directional pattern of a pure pressure-gradient microphone is like a figure-8. Other polar patterns are derived by creating a capsule that combines these two effects in different ways. The cardioid, for instance, features a partially closed backside, so its response is a combination of pressure and pressure-gradient characteristics.|$|E
25|$|The {{independent}} wrestlers {{were well}} {{received by the}} Arena Coliseo crowd, cheering especially for the portions of the match where Blue Panther and Negro Navarro wrestled against each other. The match ended when Averno forced Black Terry to submit and Blue Panther forced Villano IV to submit to win the third fall. Afterwards the fans showed their appreciation of the match by throwing money into the ring, causing both Panther and Navarro to actually go into the seats to collect more money after the match. Both Panther and Navarro teased {{that they were going}} to continue to fight, which drew a favorable response from the crowd. Before the fifth match of the night Ray Mendoza, Jr. took <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> announced to the crowd that this would actually be his last match as a professional wrestler. Rayo de Jalisco and his team won both the second and third fall to win the entire match. In the main event the challenger La Sombra and the champion Dragón Rojo, Jr. quickly split the first two falls between them, tied up at 1–1. The third fall was longer than both the previous falls combined and finally saw Dragón Rojo, Jr. successfully defend the championship when he forced La Sombra to submit.|$|E
