First, when one desires or believes or hopes, one always believes or desires or hopes something. Let’s assume that belief report 1) is true: 1) Dan Quayle believes <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> a Republican. 1) tells us that a subject, Quayle, has a certain attitude, belief, to something, designated by the nominal phrase <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> a Republican and identified by its content−sentence, 2) George Bush is a Republican. Notice that this sentence might also serve as Quayle’s belief−text, a sentence he could utter to express the belief that 1) reports him to have. Following Russell and contemporary usage I’ll call the object referred to by the that − clause in 1) and expressed by 2) a proposition. A...|$|E

NESARA supporters often tell their readers that the NESARA announcement {{is going to happen}} in a matter of days.

According to the documentary Waiting For NESARA, the claim was also made prior to March 2003 <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> planning the war with Iraq only to further delay the NESARA announcement.

5000|$|This episode parodies the {{response}} to Hurricane Katrina, particularly the various ad hoc explanations for the increased level of suffering from the hurricane and its aftermath. In addition, the episode parodies the misplaced anger and unwillingness to negotiate between all the parties in the Katrina relief effort, the distorted media coverage {{that occurred during the}} hurricane's aftermath, and the Houston mass evacuation during Hurricane Rita. For instance, when the people conclude <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> the cause of the beaver dam being broken, someone says [...] "George Bush doesn't care about beavers!" [...] in a parody of Kanye West's quote, [...] "George Bush doesn't care about black people."

25|$|Some of Horowitz's {{accounts}} of U.S. {{colleges and universities}} as bastions of liberal indoctrination have been disputed.

5000|$|Another example: [...] "The President of the USA in 2001 {{could not}} have been Al Gore". This claim seems false on a de dicto reading. Presumably, things could have gone differently, with the Supreme Court not {{claiming}} that Bush had won the election. But it looks more plausible on a de re reading. After all, we might skeptically wonder of <b>George</b> W. <b>Bush</b> whether he could have been Al Gore. Indeed, assuming <b>that</b> being <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> an essential feature of <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> and <b>that</b> this feature is incompatible with being Al Gore, a de re reading of the statement is true.|$|R

Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from {{occurring in the}} US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to {{his handling of the}} Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis—as proof <b>that</b> <b>George</b> W. <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> unfit to be president.|$|R

5000|$|Margaret Ross Sammons {{describes}} the 1984 presidential election as the [...] "pinnacle {{of the abortion}} debate" [...] but asserts {{that the issue of}} abortion continued to be prominent in subsequent presidential elections. For example, in 1996, Cardinals Bernard Law and James Hickey urged Catholics not to re-elect President Bill Clinton after he vetoed a law banning intact dilation and extraction. In 2000, Catholic leaders reacted negatively to speculation <b>that</b> Governor <b>George</b> W. <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> considering the pro-choice Catholic governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Ridge, as a possible running mate. In 2004, a number of bishops publicly declared that they would deny communion to Senator John Kerry because of his willingness to support laws protecting abortion rights despite a personal opposition to abortion. Although Kerry continued to receive communion throughout the election campaign, Sammons asserts that Kerry's campaign was sufficiently damaged by the threat to withhold communion that it may have cost him the election. Sammons argues <b>that</b> President <b>George</b> W. <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> able to win 53% of the Catholic vote because he appealed to [...] "traditional" [...] Catholics.|$|R
5000|$|The SEC's {{exhaustive}} investigation examined {{thousands of}} pages of documents.

[...] The SEC investigators concluded that the loss resulted from write-downs and expenses that occurred after he sold his stock.
