5|$|A bodyline {{delivery}} was {{one where}} the cricket ball was bowled at {{the body of the}} batsman, in the hope that when he defended himself with his bat, a resulting deflection could be caught by one of several fielders standing close by. This was considered by critics to be intimidatory and physically threatening, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> being unfair in a game that was supposed to uphold gentlemanly traditions.|$|E

Saavedra and Funes did not like him, but with the social commotion generated by Alberti's death, they avoided to offer resistance to his nomination.|$|E

5|$|In {{more recent}} years, {{according}} to Sean Wilentz, favorable views of Hamilton and his reputation have decidedly gained the initiative among scholars, who portray {{him as the}} visionary architect of the modern liberal capitalist economy and of a dynamic federal government headed by an energetic executive. Modern scholars favoring Hamilton have portrayed Jefferson and his allies, in contrast, as naïve, dreamy idealists. The older Jeffersonian view attacked Hamilton as a centralizer, sometimes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> accusations that he advocated monarchy.|$|E

Predicted total heat flux is approximately 104–5 W/m2 at the planet's surface; for comparison the surface heat flux for Io is around 3 W/m2.
