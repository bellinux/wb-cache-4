The Church of Scientology placed a 48-page advertising supplement in 1.8million copies of USA Today. In {{a statement to}} the St. Petersburg Times, Scientology spokesman Richard Haworth explained [...] "What we are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> put the actual facts of Dianetics and Scientology out there".|$|E
500|$|Casablanca {{was part}} of the film {{colorization}} controversy of the 1980s, when a colorized version aired on the television network WTBS. In 1984, MGM/UA hired Color Systems Technology to colorize the film for $180,000. When Ted Turner of Turner Broadcasting System purchased MGM/UA's film library two years later, he canceled the request, before contracting American Film Technologies (AFT) in 1988. AFT completed the colorization in two months at a cost of $450,000. Turner later reacted to the criticism of the colorization, saying, [...] " [...] {{is one of a handful}} of films that really doesn't have to be colorized. I did it because I wanted to. All I'm <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> protect my investment." ...|$|E

500|$|Nolan {{has denied}} the film criticizes the Occupy {{movement}} and insists {{that none of}} his Batman films are intended to be political: [...] "I've had as many conversations {{with people who have}} seen the film the other way round. We throw a lot of things against the wall to see if it sticks. We put a lot of interesting questions in the air, but that's simply a backdrop for the story. What we're really <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> show the cracks of society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's just telling a story. If you're saying, 'Have you made a film that's supposed to be criticizing the Occupy Wall Street movement?' – well, obviously, that's not true." ...|$|E
500|$|For much of {{his final}} two decades, Romney {{had been out of}} the {{political}} eye, but he re-emerged to the general public when he campaigned for his son, Mitt Romney, during the younger Romney's bid to unseat Senator Edward M. Kennedy in the 1994 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts. [...] Romney had urged Mitt to enter the race and moved into his son's house for its duration, serving as an unofficial advisor. [...] Romney was a vigorous surrogate for his son in public appearances and at fundraising events. [...] When Kennedy's campaign sought to bring up the LDS Church's past policy on blacks, Romney interrupted Mitt's press conference and said loudly, [...] "I think it is absolutely wrong to keep hammering on the religious issues. And what Ted is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> bring it into the picture." [...] The father counseled the son to be relaxed in appearance and to pay less attention to his political consultants and more to his own instincts, a change that the younger Romney made late in the ultimately unsuccessful campaign.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, the African American Historical and Cultural Society Museum in San Francisco {{assembled}} a Queen Califia exhibit, curated by John William Templeton, featuring works by {{artists such as}} TheArthur Wright and James Gayles; artistic interpretations of Calafia. The show displayed a 1936 treatment of Lucille Lloyd's [...] "California Allegory" [...] triptych, with Queen Califia as the central figure. Templeton said that [...] "Califia {{is a part of}} California history, and she also reinforces the fact that when Cortes named this place California, he had 300 black people with him." [...] Templeton pointed out that Columbus had a black navigator and that Africans were seen by Europeans as being culturally advanced in the 15th century. William E. Hoskins, director of the museum, said that very few people know the story of Queen Califia. He said, [...] "One of the things we're <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> let people have the additional insight and appreciation for the contributions of African Americans to this wonderful country and more specifically to the state of California", adding that [...] "the Queen Califia exhibit is particularly poignant." ...|$|E

This {{marked the first time}} Israel sent a golfer to the Olympics. Due to Israel's inexperience representing golf athletes, Beck was required to procure all of her equipment to prepare for Rio, such as her uniform and hats. Israel's Olympic committee reimbursed her for the equipment. [...] On the topic of representing Israel at the Olympics, Beck said [...] "I think its because of what my grandparents had to go through, not just my grandparents but everyone during World War II, all the Jewish people during World War II and the holocaust, that obviously brings me anger, but i think what i'm <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> bring the anger and try to do something meaningful." [...] Beck finished tied for 31st with a score of two over par. Her best round was the third round, where she was tied for 13th place.|$|E

[...] 1UP.com's top 50 most anticipated games of E3 2010 ranked Lords of Shadow at number 17. Despite the heavy anticipation, Cox noted {{there was still a}} small number of fans who did not like the game's transition to the 3D format. He stated, [...] "Fair enough, some people aren't going to like what we're doing and we accept that but generally what we're <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> bring the fans with us ... there's no point in going back and making the same game again – the point is to make a clean break and move forward with the series." ...|$|E
500|$|Violent {{attacks on}} punk fans {{were on the}} rise. In mid-June Rotten himself was {{assaulted}} by a knife-wielding gang outside Islington's Pegasus pub, causing tendon damage to his left arm. Jamie Reid and Paul Cook were beaten up in other incidents; {{three days after the}} Pegasus assault, Rotten was attacked again. A tour of Scandinavia, planned to start {{at the end of the}} month, was consequently delayed until mid-July. In Oslo, Lydon posed in front of the photographs making the Nazi salute while wearing a sweater with a Swastika drawing. During the tour, a Swedish interviewer observed to Jones that [...] "a lot of people" [...] regarded the band as McLaren's [...] "creation". Jones replied, [...] "He's our manager, that's all. He's got nothing to do with the music or the image...he's just a good manager." [...] In another interview, Rotten professed bafflement at the furore surrounding the group: [...] "I don't understand it. All we're <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> destroy everything."

500|$|Edwards {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{in front of}} the crowd of 153,000 people to celebrate his second victory of the season, earning him $425,675. He was pleased with the result, saying it was [...] "a very special win" [...] and that he felt he was close to the form he had achieved in 2005: [...] "I tried hard to stay calm. And I'm not the best at it sometimes. We all know that." [...] He added, [...] "We do this to win. Winning these races is the greatest. Winning a championship would be the ultimate. What we’re <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> win the championship this year. That’s our number-one goal.” Second-place finisher Earnhardt was disappointed, saying he had his car in his chosen position but the red-flag period prevented him from winning the race: [...] "Carl wasn't going to get beat today. He had it in the bag. He was so strong... I was terrible on cold tires. I wish all of you knew what that felt like. I hate it." [...] Biffle was philosophical as he argued that he had the fastest car but did not gain the track position he needed to challenge Edwards because he slid on pit road.|$|E

Much of these sentiments where echoed by Kate Gray of Eurogamer; she also praised the premise as interesting, but lamented that [...] "Valhallas bartending is just boring", with not enough player control to make the game feel creative. Adi Robertson of The Verge alleged that some reviewers found the game's sexualized dialogue from the female characters to be unrealistic. Ortiz responded that interactions were based upon their own interactions, including that [...] "females have always been more open about those topics than males", but he did concede that [...] "we wrote ourselves into a corner by making the cast predominantly female".|$|E
