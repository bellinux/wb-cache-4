Approximately 60 slaves were managed under the task system: each slave had a quota {{of work to}} do per day. When they were finished, they were allowed to do what they wished. Some slaves had personal gardens which they were allowed to cultivate, and from which they sold vegetables. Thirty-two cabins were constructed for and by the slaves, made from tabby, which made them durable, insulated, and inexpensive although labor-intensive. The cabins were located {{about a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) from the main house. Slaves were allowed <b>to</b> <b>padlock</b> their cabins and build porches that faced away from the main house.

5000|$|A muniment {{room was}} created in 1753 to house the {{collection}} documents relating to Radcliffe's will and the accumulated deeds of the land on which the Library had been built. Despite regular inspections, in 1817, a number of deeds {{were found to have}} degraded completely. Although the Trustees did not believe that the particular documents lost were likely to cause many future problems, the remaining manuscripts were moved to the main Library to prevent further damage. In other respects, Wise's tenure was marked only by his poor (and worsening health) and poor relations with the University. University members expected to be admitted and the Vice-Chancellor made it clear to Wise that he believed the Library part of the University and thus under his overall control. Wise did not agree, threatening at one point <b>to</b> <b>padlock</b> the Library and refer any man who cut it to the courts. The Vice-Chancellor took this as an unprovoked insult and turned to consideration of the University statutes and the imposition, if they did not already exist, of such statutes as would compel the ageing Wise to attend to his duties from which he was now regularly absent. Five years before his actual death in 1767, a satirical death notice was placed in the London papers announcing the [...] "greatly regretted" [...] death of Wise [...] "death occasioned by a violent cold, contracted by too close attendance on the duties of his respective offices". In those last years, Wise was so ill that he could no longer attend the Library. Upon his death, his collection of coins was presented to the Library.|$|E
40|$|Although social {{contracts}} {{theory has}} been applied to organizations (Donaldson & Dunfee, 1994), rarely has the theory been tested empirically. This article uses the traditions of communitarianism and individualism to instantiate an ideal-type eco-nomic social contract. We asked 269 subjects to complete the Ideological Orienta-tion Scale and to make judgments on eight downsizing scenarios. Using social judgment theory, we assess the direct and indirect influences of ideology on judg-ments of fairness. Our findings suggest that ideology indeed shapes individual’s conceptions of organizational fairness. In the decade before B. P. announced the refinery closure, Lima (Ohio) had already successfully survived the loss of at least 8, 000 jobs through repeated rounds of industrial downsizing and plant closures. Indeed, the shutdown of one more industrial plant anywhere in the Rustbelt would hardly seem to qualify as news in these closeout years of the American Cen-tury. But Lima’s story is tragically unique [...] . the rub is that B. P. had deter-mined that the rate of financial return at Lima was not high enough [...] To the further outrage of the townfolk, after assuring them that a good-faith effort would be made for a new owner, B.

P. stock gushed upward after the shutdown announcement...|$|E

5000|$|Die-casting {{became popular}} in the early 1930s among lock makers. Not only was it a very {{inexpensive}} way <b>to</b> make <b>padlocks,</b> but it allowed designers <b>to</b> design <b>padlocks</b> with {{a broad range of}} geometrical features and ornate designs that sand casting and machining wouldn't allow. Some lock makers, like Junkunc Brothers, augmented their machined solid body padlock products with the less expensive and more attractive die-cast bodied padlocks. The Wise Lock Company embraced this new medium in making a novel padlock that, with the key inserted, would split lengthwise along the body in order to create an opening in the shackle. Chicago Lock pioneered their new [...] "double bitted wafer" [...] and [...] "ACE" [...] products by installing them into a die cast body. With the advent of inexpensive machining done overseas and the overall poor perception of the security of die cast locks, they no longer dominate today's padlock market.|$|R
40|$|The {{meaning of}} the term {{computer}} security has evolved in recent years. Before the problem of data security became widely publicized in the media, most people’s idea of computer security focused on the physical machine. Traditionally, computer facilities have been physically protected for three reasons: • To prevent theft of or damage to the hardware • To prevent theft of or damage to the information • To prevent disruption of service Strict procedures for access to the machine room are used by most organizations, and these procedures are often an organization’s only obvious computer security measures. Today, however, with pervasive remote terminal access, communications, and networking, physical measures rarely provide meaningful protection for either the information or the service; only the hardware is secure. Nonetheless, most computer facilities continue to protect their physical machine far better than they do their data, even when the value of the data is several times greater than the value of the hardware. You probably are not reading this book to learn how <b>to</b> <b>padlock</b> your PC. Information security {{is the subject of this}} book. Furthermore, we are limiting our study to the insider problem: the security violations perpetrated (perhaps inadvertently) by legitimate users whom padlocks and passwords cannot deter. Most computer crimes are in fact committed by insiders, and most of the research in computer security since 1970 has been directed at the insider problem...|$|E
40|$|The Central Dogma of {{molecular}} biology describes {{a framework for}} how genetic information is transferred in cells, placing RNA as a messenger between DNA and translated proteins. During the last years, interest in RNA research has grown tremendously due to the increasing understanding and recognition {{of the importance of}} RNA in regulation of gene expression, biochemical catalysis, and genome integrity surveillance. Most importantly, RNA content, unlike DNA, changes constantly, fine-tuning the cellular response to match the environmental conditions. There is a clear potential for RNA biomarkers, reflecting both the natural and pathological conditions in vivo. Various methods have been developed to study RNA, of which the most common tools and techniques are described in this thesis. Since many of these gold standard methods are based on detecting RNA derivative (cDNA), there is a wide scope for efficient alternative tools directly targeting RNA. In Paper I, the spatiotemporal expression of human adenovirus- 5 mRNA in epithelial and blood cells infected with the virus has been studied. For this, padlock probes and rolling circle amplification (RCA) were used to visualize, quantify and analyse both viral and host cell cDNAs in different infection scenarios, at single cell level. In Paper II, direct RNA detection fidelity has been evaluated using padlock probes. A novel type of probe (iLock) that is activated on RNA via invasive cleavage mechanism, prior to RCA was developed in this approach. Using iLocks, a substantial improvement of direct RNA sensing fidelity has been observed. In Paper III, RNA modifications were introduced in otherwise DNA iLock probes to enhance the probes’ efficiency on miRNAs. Using chimeric iLock probes, multiplexed differentiation of conserved miRNA family members were performed with next- generation sequencing-by-ligation readout. Efficient replication of chimeric probes used in Paper III implies that the Phi 29 DNA polymerase readily accepts RNA-containing circles as amplification substrates. In Paper IV, real-time RCA monitoring for measurement of amplification rates and analysis of amplification patterns of various RNA-containing circles was achieved. Moreover, the RCA products were sequenced as a proof for the reverse-transcriptase activity of the Phi 29 DNA polymerase. This thesis effectively contributes {{to a better understanding of}} mechanisms influencing RNA detection with, but not limited <b>to,</b> <b>padlock</b> probes. It expands the available RNA analyses toolkit with novel strategies and solutions, which can be potentially adapted for RNA-focused research, in general and molecular diagnostics, in particular. At the time of the doctoral defense, the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 3 : Manuscript. Paper 4 : Manuscript. </p...|$|E
