5|$|In 1978, Avery {{leaves the}} Chronicle, {{and moves to}} the Sacramento Bee. Graysmith {{persistently}} contacts Toschi about the Zodiac murders, and eventually impresses the veteran detective with his knowledge of the case. While Toschi cannot directly give Graysmith access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence,</b> he provides contact names of other police departments in other counties where Zodiac murders occurred. Armstrong transfers from the San Francisco Police homicide division, and Toschi is demoted for supposedly forging a Zodiac letter. Graysmith continues his own investigation, which is profiled in the Chronicle, and he allows himself to be interviewed on television about his book-in-progress concerning the case. He begins receiving anonymous phone calls with heavy breathing. Because of his immersion in the case, Graysmith loses his job and his wife Melanie leaves him, taking their children with her. Graysmith acquires more information that points to Allen as the Zodiac, and although circumstantial evidence seems to indicate his guilt, the physical evidence, such as fingerprints and handwriting samples, do not implicate him.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> of the Chronicle that Æthelberht was {{accorded the}} title of bretwalda, {{there is evidence of}} his domination in several of the southern kingdoms of the Heptarchy. In Essex, Æthelberht appears to have been in a position to exercise authority shortly after 604, when his intervention helped in the conversion of King Sæberht of Essex, his nephew, to Christianity. It was Æthelberht, and not Sæberht, who built and endowed St. Pauls in London, where St Paul's Cathedral now stands. Further evidence is provided by Bede, who explicitly describes Æthelberht as Sæberht's overlord.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> {{of witnesses}} and CCTV cameras, there was substantial forensic evidence linking {{him to the}} murders. Investigators found over a dozen bloodstains on his car, on his clothing and in his flat, all matching the victims. There were bloodstains on the boots with which he had kicked both Corcoran and Jordan, which he was still wearing {{at the time of}} his arrest. Smith had tried to clean his clothes in the bath of his flat along with a pair of trousers belonging to Corcoran, and a bag containing items belonging to Hyde was discovered outside. Detectives matched the tyre marks from his car, which had four different types of tyre, to the Worcestershire murder scene and to Corcoran's body, over which he had driven. Paintwork and fragments of glass found on Jordan's body matched those from Smith's car, including a broken light cluster which he had thrown into the car's boot.|$|E
5|$|Katherine Hewitt (a.k.a. Mould-Heeles) {{was charged}} and {{found guilty of}} the murder of Anne Foulds. She was the wife of a clothier from Colne, and had {{attended}} the meeting at Malkin Tower with Alice Grey. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> given by James Device, both Hewitt and Grey told the others at that meeting that they had killed a child from Colne, Anne Foulds. Jennet Device also picked Katherine out of a line-up, and confirmed her attendance at the Malkin Tower meeting.|$|E
5|$|In their {{original}} description, Krause and colleagues suggested that Lavanify was most {{closely related to}} the then-unnamed Indian sudamericid. They based this proposed relationship on the shared presence of prominent, continuous bands of IPM. The teams who named the Indian gondwanathere in 2007 both agreed with this proposed relationship. In their description of Dakshina, Wilson and colleagues added the presence of an infundibulum and of perikymata <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> for the relationship between the two. These three characters are synapomorphies (shared derived traits) for the Bharattherium-Lavanify clade. They also share the presence of furrows on the lingual side of the teeth only, but whether this is a derived feature is uncertain. Wilson and colleagues list two autapomorphies (unique derived traits) of Lavanify: presence of a V-shaped dentine island and absence of enamel {{on one side of the}} crown. Prasad and colleagues who named Bharattherium, noted the absence of enamel on part of the crown of a Bharattherium tooth and interpreted this trait as a synapomorphy of Bharattherium and Lavanify. They also mentioned the presence of a furrow and infundibulum as shared traits.|$|E

25|$|In 2009 a {{group of}} British doctors who had not had access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence,</b> {{including}} Michael Powers who is a doctor, barrister and former coroner, challenged Hutton's verdict, offering their opinion based on published reports {{that the cause of}} death was untenable; they argued that the artery is small and difficult to access, and severing it would not have triggered sufficient blood loss to cause death. This opinion was challenged by several forensic pathologists who also had not had access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence,</b> who told The Guardian that the combination of Kelly's heart disease and the overdose would have meant a smaller loss of blood could have killed him than would be needed to kill a healthier person. In August 2010 the former leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Howard, called for a full inquest, and Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General for England and Wales, confirmed that he was considering re-opening it.|$|E
