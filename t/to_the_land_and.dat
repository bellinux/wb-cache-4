5|$|Ethnic Nepalis, {{who settled}} in the region during British rule, {{comprise}} the majority of Gangtok's residents. Lepchas, native <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land,</b> <b>and</b> Bhutias also constitute a sizeable portion of the populace. Additionally, {{a large number of}} Tibetans have immigrated to the town. Immigrant resident communities not native to the region include the Marwaris, who own most of the shops; the Biharis, who are employed in mostly blue collar jobs and the Bengalis.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} {{the residents}} formed the Vigilance Association {{with the intent}} of protecting their interests during the establishment of the new capital territory. Legal challenges to the resumption of the land were unsuccessful, but the Vigilance Association did win some concessions: the government agreed to pay for the improvements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land,</b> <b>and</b> did so at the value when the land was acquired; and the landowners gained the right of first refusal on their old properties when they were put up for lease. As of 2010 all residential land in the ACT is held on a 99-year crown lease.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{has been}} a focus of Mexican {{cultural}} identity, and {{is a testament to}} its colonial history. Researcher Manuel Rivera Cambas reported that the cathedral was built on the site sacred precinct of the Aztecs and with the very stones of their temples so that the Spaniards could lay claim <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> the people. Hernán Cortés supposedly laid the first stone of the original church personally.|$|E

5|$|After {{defeating}} Baramos in {{a ferocious}} battle {{and returning to}} Aliahan, the Hero's celebration is cut off as Zoma, Baramos's master and the game's true villain, reveals his existence. He attacks and opens a pit to the Dark World, which the Hero jumps into. The Dark World is, in fact, Alefgard (of the previous installments of the series), where the Hero must acquire several of the artifacts that were collected in the original Dragon Quest, including the Sun Stone and the Rain Staff. Rubiss, a legendary sage, has been turned to stone and is rescued by the Hero, and the Hero receives the Sacred Amulet in return. These items, as in the original game, create the Rainbow Bridge which leads the Hero to Zoma's castle for the final confrontation. Along the way, the Hero briefly reunites with Ortega as he is slain by Zoma's monsters, then continues on to defeat the revived Baramos, now turned into the powerful Baramos Bomus and later into the skeletal Baramos Gonus. With the Ball of Light given by the Dragon Queen, the Hero defeats Zoma and frees Alefgard, but Zoma boasts that evil will eventually return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> the Hero will not {{live long enough to}} stop it. For their bravery, the Hero receives the title of Loto (Erdrick). The Hero later vanishes from Alefgard, leaving their sword and armor to be passed down throughout the ages so that their descendants can continue to protect the world from evil.|$|E
25|$|The WOJAC functioned for {{approximately}} 25 years (from 1975 until 1999). WOJAC's aspiration was {{to operate in}} the national arena, to counterbalance the claims of the Palestinian leadership on the right <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> on the refugee question.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of an amoebaean song exchange, Corydon and Amyntas praise the emperor, {{attributing}} godlike qualities to him and stating that he has brought fertility, prosperity and peace <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> wish him a long reign.|$|E

25|$|Hardalim see {{the return}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> its {{building}} {{as a very}} important mitzvah, since they believe {{we are in the}} dawn of the messianic age. Therefore, hiking in the land, building settlements, and knowledge of its flora and fauna are considered as mitzvot.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{investigation}} {{suggested that}} Second Officer MacIsaac may have not have observed the ship's barometer and monitor the VHF radio, may have not have observed the ship's position in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> may {{have failed to}} signal the engine room in time to start the main engines.|$|E
25|$|A {{steady stream}} of electoral, legislative, and legal {{challenges}} to possible future Pebble mine development are lodged in Alaska.

6000|$|... "Do me the favour, Lord Geoffrey, to {{step down}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>and</b> {{ascertain}} if my barge is there. The officer of the boat will find me at the signal-station." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{at last we}} came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>landing,</b> <b>and</b> moored <b>the</b> {{little boat}} and walked up <b>the</b> winding path <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel. The dull pain of {{separation}} was already upon us.|$|R
60|$|We {{walked out}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>and,</b> {{descending}} <b>the</b> stairs, reached {{the street and}} stepped into the motor car that was waiting for us. It rolled off and turned into Piccadilly.|$|R
25|$|Ihram {{took her}} case <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>and</b> Environment Court, and after two actions to force Bankstown Council to give {{official}} approval, a primary school for 105 children {{was established in}} 1987.

25|$|Nabors began {{vacationing in}} Hawaii in the 1960s, and in 1976, moved from Bel Air, California, to Honolulu, Hawaii.

50|$|In October 2011, {{the museum}} was invited <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>landing,</b> <b>and</b> was given a large space to use. Their former home on the Southbank of the Riverwalk was {{demolished}} {{as part of a}} larger renovation that included Friendship Fountain.|$|R
25|$|King {{interested}} Captain James Walworth {{in acquiring}} the entire de la Garza grant, which Walworth completed on December 26, 1856, for $5,000 paid to Praxides Uribe.

25|$|From 1815, {{after years}} of {{military}} conflict, in full Restoration, Granville seemed {{to take a new}} direction.

25|$|The {{achievement}} {{was not without}} considerable middle-class hostility to the labourer movement. Farmer, shopkeeper, clerical and political party hostility originated not alone locally, ill-will was equally noticeable at a national level. The Irish Party leadership refused to consider direct Parliamentary representation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>and</b> Labour Association, {{an indication of the}} middle-class determination with maintaining its hold over national politics.|$|E
50|$|Premier Ernest Manning shuffled {{his cabinet}} after the 1955 election. He {{appointed}} Willmore <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lands</b> <b>and</b> Forests portfolio.

50|$|The Ironton Ferry {{has been}} {{captured}} by many artists, both amateur and professional.

25|$|The action proved {{controversial}} inside Israel. The settlers, {{backed by}} the right-wing, {{as shown in the}} Likud referendum, claimed Israel had a historic right <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> that they provided an important defense buffer against attacks by Palestinians. The conservative government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon argued that remaining in Gaza was too costly in both money and lives.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th year of Artaxerxes I of Persia, Nehemiah, cup-bearer to the King in Susa (the Persian capital), {{learns that}} {{the wall of}} Jerusalem is destroyed.

25|$|The Book of Malachi {{was written}} {{to correct the}} lax {{religious}} and social behaviour of the Israelites – particularly the priests – in post-exilic Jerusalem. Although the prophets urged the people of Judah and Israel to see their exile as punishment for failing to uphold their covenant with Elohim, {{it was not long}} after they had been restored <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> to Temple worship that the people's commitment to their God began, once again, to wane. It was in this context that the prophet commonly referred to as Malachi delivered his prophecy.|$|E
60|$|But for {{a slight}} stumble half-way up his {{progress}} was very creditable for an amateur. He paused and listened and, all being silent, {{made his way}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>and</b> stopped out-side a door. Despite himself his heart was beating faster than usual.|$|R
