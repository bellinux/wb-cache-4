5|$|Like the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, Guangzhou also {{attempted}} to raise <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> of the city. The authority had pledged ￥600 million {{to fight the}} problem, and had ordered around 32 chemical plants to stop production {{by the end of}} 2009. A report shown on July 13, 2010 indicates that <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> was rated at 95.07% in 2009, an increase of 12.01% since 2004; this improvement eventually cost authorities ￥24 billion. Later action from organisers to curb the pollution included decreasing the movement of vehicles up to 40 percent and banning barbecue stalls in 11 cities.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, an {{intrusive}} {{public works}} inspector (Carter Jahncke) tests <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> at the squad room, but insists to an inquisitive Gee {{that everything is}} fine. The next day, however, Gee goes upstairs and finds a team wearing protective respirator suits removing hazardous asbestos from the wall. Gee angrily confronts Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) and Colonel Granger (Gerald F. Gough) for not informing the detectives about the work, and demands it be stopped until precautionary medical checks can be conducted. Barnfather and Granger insist the removal work is safe, but give in when Gee threatens {{to go to the}} media. Meanwhile, Lewis (Clark Johnson) brags repeatedly to Crosetti (Jon Polito) about his new Ford FE V8 engine and the car he plans to build. Crosetti feigns disinterest, but the next day presents Lewis with a rear-view mirror as a gift.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether a sentiment effect arising from poor <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> negatively affects stock prices. We find little {{evidence suggesting that}} local <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> directly affects stock prices. However, we show that <b>the</b> local <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> index (which is increasing in air pollution) relative to that of Beijing negatively affects stock prices. We apply a discontinuity design that focuses on observations with <b>the</b> relative <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> index falling in the narrow band around zero and find a consistent result. Additional analysis unveils a subsequent reversal in stock prices in response to <b>the</b> relative <b>air</b> <b>quality.</b> Further, <b>the</b> relative <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> index also negatively affects trading volume. Finally, we show that the negative association between stock prices and <b>the</b> relative <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> index is not influenced by economic fundamentals or investor sophistication. In sum, {{our findings suggest that}} poor <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> negatively affects stock prices and investor trading activities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Following the {{development}} of regional economy, especially the construction of Tianjin Binhai new district, environmental pollution and ecological hazards has been resulted from the pollutant discharge and reclamation etc. <b>The</b> environmental <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> {{is very important for}} the health of human being, so it is very important for analyzing and evaluating <b>the</b> environmental <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> for guiding <b>the</b> environmental management and control. In this paper, <b>the</b> environmental <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> of recent fourteen years in Tianjin is analyzed.

5|$|The {{inquiry report}} failed to {{identify}} a definite cause, although it was considered that the most likely cause was a spark from the signalling gear. It would have ignited the firedamp, exacerbated and fuelled by coal dust in the air. The report was critical of {{many aspects of the}} management's practices, and considered it had breached the mining regulations in respect of measuring and maintaining <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> in the workings, and in the removal of coal dust from the tracks and walkways. The report pointed out that because the management had not implemented the changes needed to the ventilation fans as demanded by the Coal Mines Act 1911, the fans were unable to reverse the direction of the airflow, which would have blown the smoke out through the Lancaster shaft, although Redmayne and his colleagues held differing opinions on the advisability of reversing or stopping the airflow. The historian John H Brown, in his examination of the disaster, states that had the airflow been reversed, firedamp or afterdamp could have been extracted from some sectors into the blaze, causing another explosion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{years of the}} programme, {{particularly}} during the Shuttle-Mir programme, Mir suffered from various systems failures. It had been designed for five years of use, but eventually flew for fifteen, and in the 1990s was showing its age, with constant computer crashes, loss of power, uncontrolled tumbles through space and leaking pipes. NASA astronaut John Blaha's account of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> on Mir—"very healthy, it's not dry, it's not humid. Nothing smells."—contradicts sharply the concerns about air quality on the space station that Jerry Linenger relates in his book about his time on the facility. Linenger says that due {{to the age of}} the space station, the cooling system had developed tiny leaks too small and numerous to be repaired, that permitted the constant release of coolant, making it unpleasant to breathe the air. He says that it was especially noticeable after he had made a spacewalk and become used to the bottled air in his spacesuit. When he returned to the station and again began breathing the air inside Mir, he was deeply shocked by the intensity of the chemical smell and very worried about the possible negative health effects of breathing such heavily contaminated air.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> indoor <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> {{management}} of <b>the</b> public places is gaining wide attention in Korea, because <b>the</b> indoor <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> of <b>the</b> public places {{are obliged to}} satisfy the guidelines suggested by Korean Ministry of Environment. According to this regulation, the railroad stations are regarded as public places while the passenger cabin of train is excluded. However, because the passengers {{spend more time in}} the passenger cabin than in the stations, <b>the</b> indoor <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> {{management of}} <b>the</b> passenger cabin is more important.

25|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> was set {{to improve}} {{with the arrival of}} the Northeast monsoon rains in mid-October, southeasterly winds {{extended}} the hazy season.

The prolonged haze could be attributed to the extended dry season, which put the rains on hold and affected wind patterns which brought the haze to Singapore. Intermittent showers could occur in the pre-monsoon period, but these would do little in increasing air quality. The unpredictable winds in the pre-monsoon period could bring haze from either Sumatra or Kalimantan.|$|E
