5|$|The forearms {{are dark}} gray. The forefeet are unpigmented and ungual <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> white hairs {{surround}} the equally unpigmented claws. The animal has long, narrow hindfeet, longer than in T.talamancae, with usually smooth soles (lacking squamae, which {{are present in}} T.talamancae). The three middle digits are much longer than the outer two. Six pads are present on the sole. The upper surface and {{the sides of the}} hindfeet are white and appear naked, although short, white hairs are present; these hairs are longer in T.talamancae. Ungual <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> long, white or gray hairs are present around the claws, which are short and lack pigment.|$|E
5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or {{sitting on top of}} wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E
5|$|Whitman's work {{breaks the}} {{boundaries}} of poetic form and is generally prose-like. He also used unusual images and symbols in his poetry, including rotting leaves, <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> straw, and debris. He also openly wrote about death and sexuality, including prostitution. He is often labeled {{as the father of}} free verse, though he did not invent it.|$|E

5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, {{is the idea}} that the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail. Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> hair that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.|$|E
5|$|As {{is typical}} for such small animals, {{there are no}} {{respiratory}} or circulatory organs. The nervous system is relatively simple. The brain consists of two ganglia, one {{on either side of}} the pharynx, connected by a commissure. From these lead a pair of nerve cords which run along either side of the body beside the longitudinal muscle bands. The primary sensory organs are the bristles and ciliated <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> the body surface which function as mechanoreceptors. There are also ciliated pits on the head, simple ciliary photoreceptors and fleshy appendages which act as chemoreceptors.|$|E
5|$|Cyptotrama asprata (alternatively spelled aspratum), {{commonly}} known as the golden-scruffy collybia, is a saprobic species of mushroom in the family Physalacriaceae. Widely distributed in tropical regions of the world, it is characterized by the bright orange to yellow cap that in young specimens is covered with <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> fibrils resembling small spikes. This fungus has had a varied taxonomical history, having been placed in fourteen genera before finally settling in Cyptotrama. This species is differentiated from several other similar members of genus Cyptotrama by variations in cap color, and spore size and shape.|$|E

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium, {{commonly}} known as common cottongrass or common cottonsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family Cyperaceae. Native to North America, North Asia, and Northern Europe, it grows on peat or acidic soils, in open wetland, heath or moorland. It begins to flower in April or May and, after fertilisation in early summer, the small, unremarkable brown and green flowers develop distinctive white bristle-like seed-heads that resemble <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> cotton; combined with its ecological suitability to bog, these characteristics give rise to the plant's alternative name, bog cotton.|$|E
5|$|Like many ink caps, {{it grows}} in tufts. It is {{commonly}} associated with buried wood and is found in grassland, meadows, disturbed ground, and open terrain from late spring to autumn. Fruiting bodies {{have been known to}} push their way up through asphalt and even tennis courts. It is also common in urban areas and appears in vacant lots, and <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> fungi can be quite large and fruit several times a year. If dug up, the mycelium can often be found originating on buried dead wood.|$|E
5|$|Most spiders that hunt actively, {{rather than}} relying on webs, have dense <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> fine hairs between the paired claws at the tips of their legs. These tufts, known as scopulae, consist of {{bristles}} whose ends are split into as many as 1,000 branches, and enable spiders with scopulae to walk up vertical glass and upside down on ceilings. It appears that scopulae get their grip from contact with extremely thin layers of water on surfaces. Spiders, like most other arachnids, keep at least four legs on the surface while walking or running.|$|E

5|$|The hindfeet {{are long}} and have the three central digits longer than the two outer ones. They are white to pale yellow above, where the foot is covered with hairs, which are longer than in T.bolivaris. The digits of the hindfeet are {{surrounded}} by ungual <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> silvery hair that are longer than the claws themselves. The claws are short and sharp. Parts of the sole are covered by indistinct scales (squamae), which are usually entirely absent in T.bolivaris. The pads are moderately large.|$|E
5|$|The larva is a {{voracious}} predator. Within a {{few minutes}} of seizing its prey with its jaws and injecting it with venom and enzymes, it begins to suck out the digestion products. The larva is extremely sensitive to ground vibrations, the low-frequency sounds made by an insect crawling across the ground; the larva locates the source of the vibrations by the differences in timing of the arrival of waves detected by receptors, <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> hairs {{on the sides of the}} two hindmost thoracic segments.|$|E
5|$|The two lions have a male mane, {{patterned}} with dense, short lines; the manes continue beneath the body. Distinctly patterned <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> hair grow from the lion's ears {{and on their}} shoulders, emanating from a central disk-shaped whorl. They lie prone, their heads are sculpted with attention to detail, but {{with a degree of}} artistic liberty in their form, e.g., regarding their rounded shapes. Both lions look towards the viewer, and both have their mouths closed.|$|E

5|$|Like {{those of}} all passerines, the chicks are altricial; {{they are born}} blind and covered only by sparse <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> brown down on their backs, {{shoulders}} and parts of wings. By four days they open their eyes, and pin feathers emerge from their wings on day six, {{and the rest of}} the body on days seven and eight. Both parents feed the young, and are sometimes assisted by helper birds. The Pacific koel and pallid cuckoo (Cuculus pallidus) have been recorded as brood parasites of the blue-faced honeyeater, and the laughing kookaburra recorded as preying on broods.|$|E
5|$|Most millipedes are slow-moving detritivores, eating {{decaying}} {{leaves and}} other dead plant matter. Some eat fungi or suck plant fluids, {{and a small}} minority are predatory. Millipedes are generally harmless to humans, although some can become household or garden pests, especially in greenhouses where they can cause severe damage to emergent seedlings. Most millipedes defend themselves {{with a variety of}} chemicals secreted from pores along the body, although the tiny bristle millipedes are covered with <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> detachable bristles. Reproduction in most species is carried out by modified male legs called gonopods, which transfer packets of sperm to females.|$|E
5|$|Mycena galericulata {{produces}} a white spore print. The spores are , 8–10 by 5.5–7μm, and amyloid—which means they will turn blue-black to black when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) have stout sterigmata, and measure 34–40 by 7–9μm. They may be either two-spored or four-spored. There are numerous club-shaped to rounded cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge), that measure 32–40 by 8–12μm; their apices or the entire enlarged portion bear rodlike projections that become increasingly elongated and branched in age. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The gill tissue {{has a very}} thin cuticle, under which is a narrow hypoderm, while {{the remainder of the}} tissue comprises densely matted <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> mycelia, and stains deep vinaceous-brown in iodine. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of the four-spored forms.|$|E

5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi is a {{medium-sized}} oryzomyine with small ears and large feet, and {{is similar to}} the marsh rice rat in general appearance. The long and coarse fur is brownish above and ochraceous below. At the base of the tail, the upper and lower sides differ in color and at the end is a short tuft of hairs. The scales on the tail are well-developed. As in other Oryzomys, the hindfeet exhibit specializations for life in the water. The plantar (lower) surface of the metatarsus is naked. Two of the pads are very small. Ungual tufts, <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> hair at the bases of the claws, are poorly developed. Interdigital webbing is present, but extends along {{less than half of the}} first phalanges.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in Eriophorum angustifolium {{begins with}} flowering in spring or early summer (in or around May), when groups of 3–5 brown flowers are produced. Fertilisation usually {{takes place in}} May or June, via anemophily (wind-pollination), and the white bristle-like perianth, composed of achenes with pappi (seeds with hairs) then grows outwards to appear like short <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> cotton thread. These pappi endure well into summer, lasting from around June to September. Like the pappus of Taraxacum (dandelions), this aids in wind-dispersal, and also serves as thermal insulation, conserving {{the temperature of the}} plant's reproductive organs by trapping solar radiation.|$|E
5|$|Species of Oryzomys are {{medium-sized}} rats with long, coarse fur. The upperparts are gray to reddish and the underparts {{white to}} buff. The animals have broad feet with reduced or absent ungual <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> hair around the claws and, {{in at least}} some species, with webbing between the toes. The rostrum (front part of the skull) is broad and the braincase is high. Both the marsh rice rat and O.couesi have 56chromosomes, lack a gall bladder, and have a complex penis (as is characteristic of the Sigmodontinae) with some traits that are rare among oryzomyines; these characteristics are unknown in the other species of this genus.|$|E
