40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the health promotion, stress and <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and relationship between those factors in patients with genital neoplasms. Method: Data of 151 subjects with genital neoplasms were collected from August 15 to October 12, 2009 at out-patient clinic in one general hospital in Daegu. Results: The mean score of health promotion of the subjects was 1. 49 (± 0. 53), stress of gynecologic cancer was 1. 36 (± 0. 76) and <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subjects was 2. 38 (± 0. 59).
