5|$|By {{the time}} of Stanley's {{election}} to the House, the American <b>Tobacco</b> Company had eliminated all its substantial competitors either by acquisition or by driving them out of business. The company worked with British <b>tobacco</b> manufacturers to set <b>tobacco</b> prices worldwide. Congressman Stanley came {{to the defense of}} the <b>tobacco</b> farmers of his district, making him virtually unbeatable as a congressional candidate. In the first of his five consecutive terms, he authored a bill that would remove an oppressive national <b>tobacco</b> tax, hoping this would help raise prices for unprocessed <b>tobacco.</b> The bill was defeated by extensive lobbying efforts by the American <b>Tobacco</b> Company. In 1904, he convinced the Ways and Means Committee to hold public hearings on the American <b>Tobacco</b> Company's monopolistic actions, but the hearings did not convince legislators to repeal the tax nor take action against the American <b>Tobacco</b> Company.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt is a {{constituent}} of <b>tobacco</b> smoke. The <b>tobacco</b> plant readily absorbs and accumulates heavy metals such as Cobalt {{from the surrounding}} soil into its leaves. These are subsequently inhaled during <b>tobacco</b> smoking.|$|E
5|$|Leaf <b>tobacco</b> {{is cheap}} {{and can be}} bought from markets to roll one's own cigarettes. Many rural farmers produce {{homegrown}} <b>tobacco</b> on their own plot of land, while others steal <b>tobacco</b> from cooperative farms for sale.|$|E

Mac Baren's Choice series {{is a line}} of mild aromatic pipe and flavoured hand-rolling <b>tobaccos</b> aimed at a younger audience. In 2010, Mac Baren introduced 7 Seas, a line of American-style aromatic pipe <b>tobaccos</b> broadly similar to, and intended to compete with, STG's Captain Black.|$|R
60|$|Colonel Clark {{replied that}} he knew well of the {{fidelity}} of <b>Tobacco's</b> Son to the Big Knives, that <b>Tobacco's</b> Son had remained stanch {{in the face of}} bribes and presents (this was true). Now all that Colonel Clark desired of <b>Tobacco's</b> Son besides his friendship was that he would keep his warriors from battle. The Big Knives would fight their own fight. To this sentiment <b>Tobacco's</b> Son grunted extreme approval. Colonel Clark turned to me.|$|R

5|$|The <b>tobacco</b> {{industry}} in North Korea is substantial, with 53,000 hectares (2.3 {{percent of its}} arable land) dedicated to <b>tobacco</b> cultivation. This is the fourth-highest percentage of arable land dedicated to <b>tobacco</b> in the world, with the annual output exceeding 80,000 tonnes, making North Korea {{one of the top}} 25 <b>tobacco</b> worldwide producers. This is despite 31% of North Koreans being malnourished. The best, strongest and most expensive <b>tobacco</b> comes from the north of the country near the border with China.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} North Korean <b>tobacco</b> companies, making some 30 {{different}} types of cigarettes, with the biggest <b>tobacco</b> company being the North Korea General <b>Tobacco</b> Corporation. Some companies export <b>tobacco</b> to the Middle East and elsewhere, sometimes in partnership with foreign firms. For example, the Taedong River <b>Tobacco</b> Company and the Rason Shinhung <b>Tobacco</b> Company, both operating in the Rason Special Economic Zone, are partnered with the Chinese Jilin <b>Tobacco.</b> British American <b>Tobacco</b> also has business in the country, but it has reduced its involvement due to political pressure and public relations reasons. During the Cold War, North Korea paid for goods it imported from the Soviet Union with poor quality <b>tobacco.</b> Later, {{during the years of}} the Sunshine Policy, high-end Pyongyang brand cigarettes were exported to South Korea where they were popular among South Koreans who wanted to express a pro-reunification stance. There are some privately owned <b>tobacco</b> factories, some of which are known to produce counterfeit brand cigarettes for export as part of North Korea's illicit activities to earn hard currency.|$|E
5|$|Anti-tobacco {{sentiment}} {{existed in}} Germany {{in the early}} 20th century. Critics of smoking organized the first anti-tobacco group in the country named the Deutscher Tabakgegnerverein zum Schutze der Nichtraucher (German <b>Tobacco</b> Opponents' Association for the Protection of Non-smokers). Established in 1904, this organization existed {{for a brief period}} only. The next anti-tobacco organization, the Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner (Federation of German <b>Tobacco</b> Opponents), was established in 1910 in Trautenau, Bohemia. Other anti-smoking organizations were established in 1912 in the cities of Hanover and Dresden. In 1920, a Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in der Tschechoslowakei (Federation of German <b>Tobacco</b> Opponents in Czechoslovakia) was formed in Prague, after Czechoslovakia was separated from Austria at the end of World War I. A Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in Deutschösterreich (Federation of German <b>Tobacco</b> Opponents in German Austria) was established in Graz in 1920.|$|E

5|$|Copper is a {{constituent}} of <b>tobacco</b> smoke. The <b>tobacco</b> plant readily absorbs and accumulates heavy metals, such as copper {{from the surrounding}} soil into its leaves.

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 16th century, Europeans' {{interest}} in the New World revolved around gold and silver and not <b>tobacco.</b> The European lack of interest in <b>tobacco</b> was due to the fact that the Amerindians controlled the <b>tobacco</b> industry; as long as the Amerindians controlled the supply there was no need for the incorporation in European commercial capitalism.|$|E
5|$|Finally in 1909, Stanley {{attached}} {{his proposed}} {{repeal of the}} <b>tobacco</b> tax as a rider to the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act. The bill passed the House, but the Senate stripped Stanley's provision. Kentucky Senator Ollie M. James reintroduced the repeal into the Senate version of the bill, and it survived when the bill was passed into law. The repeal resulted in higher <b>tobacco</b> prices, and although Stanley had not been alone in getting the repeal passed, he received much of the credit. In 1911, Stanley's fight against the American <b>Tobacco</b> Company bore fruit, as the Supreme Court ruled the company to be in violation of antitrust laws and broke it into separate companies. Both the tax repeal and the breakup of American <b>Tobacco</b> helped quell the violence perpetrated by the Night Riders.|$|E

5|$|In 1957 Van der Byl {{was made}} a Director of the United Dominions Corporation (Rhodesia) Ltd, having already become {{an active member of}} the Rhodesia <b>Tobacco</b> Association. In 1956, he was elected by the members of the Selous–Gadzema {{district}} to represent them on the <b>Tobacco</b> Association council. He was also Deputy Chair of the Selous Farmers' Association in 1957. His first involvement in government was in 1960 when the Rhodesia <b>Tobacco</b> Association made him one of their representatives on the National Native Labour Commission, on which he served for two years. In 1961, he also represented the Rhodesia <b>Tobacco</b> Association on the council of the Rhodesian National Farmers Union. He was recognised as a leading spokesman for Rhodesian <b>tobacco</b> farmers.|$|E
5|$|Polonium-210 in <b>tobacco</b> {{contributes}} {{to many of}} the cases of lung cancer worldwide. Most of this polonium is derived from lead-210 deposited on <b>tobacco</b> leaves from the atmosphere; the lead-210 is a product of radon-222 gas, much of which appears to originate from the decay of radium-226 from fertilizers applied to the <b>tobacco</b> soils.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of polonium in <b>tobacco</b> smoke {{has been known}} since the early 1960s. Some of the world's biggest <b>tobacco</b> firms researched ways to remove the substance—to no avail—over a 40-year period. The results were never published.|$|E

5|$|Willson's {{interventions}} ultimately {{had little}} to do with the end of the violence. In 1908, the courts began handing down convictions against the Night Riders, though many of their leaders escaped the convictions. A 1909 measure sponsored by Kentucky representative Augustus O. Stanley removed a national tax on <b>tobacco,</b> and in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found the American <b>Tobacco</b> Company to be in violation of antitrust laws. Each of these events helped raise <b>tobacco</b> prices, pacifying the violent farmers.|$|E

In general, North Koreans tend to prefer strong <b>tobacco</b> and different classes of quality range from homegrown to sought-after foreign brands that are considered status symbols.

5|$|Beverley {{inherited}} a large estate after his father's death in 1722, and continued speculating in land. He received income from <b>tobacco</b> production and rent from tenant farmers. Although by 1745 Beverley's estate produced 57 hogsheads (about 26,000kg) of <b>tobacco,</b> the income from his 119 tenants in Caroline, Culpeper, Orange and King and Queen Counties {{was far more}} lucrative.|$|E

His experiments showed the toxic agent to be carbon monoxide, resulting alike from cigarette, pipe, or cigar.|$|E
