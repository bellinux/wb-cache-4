5|$|The International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially {{launched}} the bid {{process for the}} 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics on May 16, 2007. All then 203 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) were invited to submit {{the name of a}} city within their jurisdiction until September 13, 2007. On September 14, the IOC recognized seven cities—Baku, Chicago, Doha, Madrid, Prague, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo—which had been put forward by their respective NOCs to bid. On October 1, 2007, the Rio de Janeiro bid committee paid the required fee of USD 150,000 to the IOC and signed the Candidature Acceptance Procedure. Soon after, from October 15 to 19, Rio officials attended the 2016 Applicant cities' Seminar organized by the IOC at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, where they learnt more about technical areas that would be analyzed throughout the application process. On January 14, 2008, the seven Applicant cities returned documents, known as the Application Files, containing the answers and guarantees requested by the 2016 Candidature Acceptance Procedure, which provided to the IOC an overview of each city's project. <b>The</b> <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> studied by the IOC Working Group for months and served as the basis to the shortlist of Chicago, Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro and Madrid on June 4, 2008, becoming Candidate cities during a meeting of the IOC Executive Board at the 2008 SportAccord Convention in Athens, Greece.|$|E

25|$|Atomoxetine is {{approved}} {{for use in}} children, adolescents, and adults. However, its efficacy has not been studied in children under six years old. Its primary advantage over the standard stimulant treatments for ADHD {{is that it has}} little known abuse potential.

Additionally, 40% of participants who were treated with atomoxetine experienced significant residual ADHD symptoms.|$|E

Researchers found that participants improved in the areas of emotional recognition in voices and faces and in considering the thoughts of other people. Participants were also surveyed months after the study for how effective they thought the treatments were, and <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> overwhelmingly positive. Many other studies have also explored this occupational therapy option.|$|E

25|$|In May 1889, Bashkale Resistance was {{the bloody}} {{encounter}} of three revolutionaries of Armenakan. Bashkale was {{a town in}} the Van Province. The comrades Karapet Koulaksizian, Hovhannes Agripasian, and Vardan Goloshian were stopped and demanded that they disarm. On them were two documents addressed to Koulaksizian, one from Avetis Patiguian of London and the other from Mëkërtich Portukalian, in Marseille. Ottoman's believed that the men were members of a large revolutionary apparatus and the discussion was reflected on newspapers, (Eastern Express, Oriental Advertiser, Saadet, and Tarik) and <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> on the Armenian papers. In some Armenian circles, this event was considered as a martyrdom and brought other armed conflicts.|$|E

[...] In her book, Lady in the Navy, Joy Bright Hancock quotes his reply: [...] "I advised Mrs. Rogers that at the present time I saw no great need for such a bill..." [...] Nevertheless, within days Nimitz was in touch with all Navy Department bureaus asking them to assess their needs for an equivalent to the WAAC. With few exceptions, <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> negative. Yet, Congressional inquiries continued to increase about the Navy's plan for women.|$|E

60|$|And {{then there}} was Miss Gushing,--a young thing. Miss Gushing had a great {{advantage}} over the other competitors for the civilisation of Mr Oriel, namely, in this--that {{she was able to}} attend his morning services. If Mr Oriel was to be reached in any way, it was probable that he might be reached in this way. If anything could civilise him, this would do it. Therefore, the young thing, through all one long, tedious winter, tore herself from her warm bed, and was to be seen--no, not seen, but heard--entering Mr Oriel's church at six o'clock. With indefatigable assiduity <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> made, uttered from under a close bonnet, and out of a dark corner, in an enthusiastically feminine voice, through the whole winter.|$|E

60|$|There {{were three}} priestesses at Dodona {{in the days}} of Herodotus. Their names were Promenea, Timarete, and Nicandre. The answers of the oracle were, for a time, {{obtained}} by the priestesses from some appearances which they observed in the sacred beech on which the dove alighted, when the tree was agitated by the wind. In later times, however, <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> obtained in a still more singular manner. Then was a brazen statue of a man, holding a whip in his hand. The whip had three lashes, which were formed of brazen chains. At the end of each chain was an astragalus, as it was called, which was a row of little knots or knobs, such as were commonly appended to the lashes of whips used in those days for scourging criminals.|$|E
60|$|There is no doubt, however, that in {{many cases}} <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> given in {{collusion}} with the one who consulted the oracle, for the purpose of deceiving others. For example, let us suppose that Croesus wished to establish strongly the credibility of the Delphic oracle in the minds of his countrymen, in order to encourage them to enlist in his armies, and to engage in the enterprise which he was contemplating against Cyrus with resolution and confidence; {{it would have been easy}} for him to have let the priestess at Delphi know what he was doing on the day when he sent to inquire, and thus himself to have directed her answer. Then, when his messengers returned, he would appeal to the answer as proof of the reality of the inspiration which seemed to furnish it. Alexander the Great certainly did, in this way, act in collusion with the priests at the temple of Jupiter Ammon.|$|E
60|$|And Whit-Monday came. At half-past ten the rude {{music of}} the band of the Friendly Society came pealing {{from the top of}} the hill, then {{appeared}} two tall flags, crowned with guelder roses and peonies, then the great blue drum, the clarionet blown by red-waist-coated and red- faced Mr. Appleton, the three flutes and the triangle, all at their loudest, causing some of the spectators to start, and others to dance. Then behold the whole procession of labourers, in white round frocks, blue ribbons in their hats, and tall blue staves in their hands. In the rear, the confused mob, women and children, cheerful faces and mirthful sounds everywhere. These were hushed as the flags were lowered to pass under the low-roofed gateway of the churchyard, and all was still, except the trampling of feet on the stone floor. Then the service began, <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> made in full and hearty tones, almost running into a chant, the old 133rd Psalm was sung as loudly and as badly as usual, a very short but very earnest sermon was preached, and forth came the troop again.|$|E

I shall of course receive the Sacrament the first time I have an opportunity, and I trust worthily. I think {{there must have been}} 200 confirmed. The Bishop gave us a very good charge afterwards, recommending us all to take pattern by the self-denial and true devotion of the Bishop of New Zealand, on whom he spoke for a long-while. The whole ceremony was performed with the greatest decorum, and in the retiring and coming up of the different sets there was very little noise, and not the slightest confusion. I went up with the first set, and the Bishop came round and put his hands on the heads of the whole set (about forty), and then going into the middle pronounced the prayer. <b>The</b> <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> all made very audibly, and everyone seemed to be impressed with a proper feeling of the holiness and seriousness of the ceremony.
