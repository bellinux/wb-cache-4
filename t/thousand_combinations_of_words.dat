40|$|The {{classification}} of texts {{and pieces of}} texts uses the occurrence <b>of,</b> <b>combinations</b> <b>of,</b> <b>words</b> as an important indicator. Not every <b>word</b> or each <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> gives {{a clear indication of}} the {{classification of}} a piece of text. Research has been done on methods that select some <b>words</b> or <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> that are more indicative of the type of a piece <b>of</b> text. These <b>words</b> or <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> are selected from the words and word-groups as they occur in the texts. These more indicative <b>words</b> or <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> we call ¿cue-phrases¿. The goal of these methods is to select the most indicative cue-phrases first. The collection <b>of</b> selected <b>words</b> and/or <b>combinations</b> thereof can then be used for training the classification system. To test these selection methods, a number of experiments has been done on a corpus containing cookbook recipes and on a corpus of four-participant meetings. To perform these experiments, a computer program was written. On the recipe corpus we looked at classifying the sentences into different types. Some examples of these types include ¿requirement¿ and ¿instruction¿. On the four-person meeting corpus we tried to learn, using only lexical features, whether a sentence is addressed to an individual or a group. The experiments on the recipe corpus produced good results that showed that, a number of, the used cue-phrase selection methods are suitable for feature selection. The experiments on the four-person meeting corpus where less successful in terms of performance off the classification task. We did see comparable patterns in selection methods, and considering the results of Jovanovic we can conclude that different features are needed for this particular classification task. One of the original goals was to look at ¿addressee¿ in discussions. Are sentences more often addressed to individuals inside discussions compared to outside discussions? However, {{in order to be able}} to accomplish this, we must first identify the segments of the text that are discussions. It proved hard to come to a reliable specification of discussions, and our initial definition wasn¿t sufficient...|$|R

In this study, we carried out more experiments to find the better way to index Chinese texts. First, we investigated the inpacts on IR performance of the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>word</b> segmentation. Second, fifteen different groups of indexing units, which were the possible <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> and character n-grams, were discussed detailedly.
