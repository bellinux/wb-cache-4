5|$|Just {{over half}} of the French {{infantry}} were regulars of the old Royal Army, as were nearly all of the cavalry and, most importantly, the artillery, which were widely regarded as the best in Europe at the time. These veterans provided a professional core <b>to</b> <b>steady</b> the enthusiastic volunteer battalions. Combined, Dumouriez' Army of the North and Kellermann's Army of the Centre totalled approximately 54,000 troops. Heading towards them was Brunswick's coalition army of about 84,000, all veteran Prussian and Austrian troops augmented by large complements of Hessians and the French royalist Army of Condé.|$|E
40|$|This paper presents, {{within a}} {{framework}} of the Solow model, evidence that there are significant differences in convergence patterns across subsamples. It shows that although OECD countries and the countries converging <b>to</b> their <b>steady</b> states from above follow a pattern of conditional convergence, those converging <b>to</b> their <b>steady</b> states from below do not. This result is best explained {{by the idea that}} technology diffusion has a large effect mainly on the countries converging <b>to</b> their <b>steady</b> states from below. ...|$|R
30|$|In {{view of the}} foregoing, it was {{observed}} in earlier studies by the present authors [57] that SSA was clearly inadequate {{in the analysis of}} the reaction kinetics of hydrocarbon pyrolysis. It was confirmed elsewhere [57] that SSA was inadequate as associated simulated radical concentrations for n-heptane pyrolysis were observed to vary significantly with reaction time. These plots revealed that radical concentrations do not obey the SSA theory. They only appear to do so after the initial rapid increase. Whereas the primary radicals appeared <b>to</b> attain <b>steady</b> state, the secondary radicals did not exhibit this behavior. Secondly, the secondary radicals started to form when the primary radicals began <b>to</b> attain <b>steady</b> state. This implies that not all radicals appeared <b>to</b> attain <b>steady</b> state during n-heptane pyrolysis. Therefore, for simulation purposes radicals, which appear <b>to</b> attain <b>steady</b> state could be subjected <b>to</b> pseudo <b>steady</b> state approximation (PSSA), while others are treated the same way as molecular species.|$|R
30|$|Intuitively, we can {{see that}} as ũ_ 1 (t) converges <b>to</b> its <b>steady</b> state, all other {{variables}} converge, with some “delay,” <b>to</b> their <b>steady</b> states as well. We may say that as the first column converges, it “drags” other elements <b>to</b> their <b>steady</b> states. In the worst case, the consequent (following) column starts to converge only when the previous column is fully converged. This behavior differs from the known methods where we have to wait for ũ_ 1 (t) to be converged before computing other terms.|$|R
5|$|Light {{wind shear}} and {{favorable}} ocean temperatures led <b>to</b> <b>steady</b> intensification of the storm, and satellite images indicated that an eye had developed late on August 31. Minimum pressure lowered to , and the maximum winds increased to 100mph, Category2 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm quickly reached Category3, a major hurricane, and soon after, Category4. As it did so, its eye became ragged, while its lateral {{movement to the}} northwest rose to 17mph around the southern periphery of a strong deep-layer ridge over the United States. By September 1, the hurricane reached its peak intensity of 160mph (260km/h) and a minimum pressure of 921mb (hPa). It had reached Category5, the second of three such powerful storms that would do so during the season.|$|E
5|$|Marlborough {{now had to}} {{turn his}} {{attention}} from the fleeing enemy to direct Churchill to detach more infantry to storm Blenheim. Orkney's infantry, Hamilton's English brigade and St Paul's Hanoverians moved across the trampled wheat to the cottages. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting gradually forced the French towards the village centre, {{in and around the}} walled churchyard which had been prepared for defence. Hay and Ross's dismounted dragoons were also sent, but suffered under a counter-charge delivered by the regiments of Artois and Provence under command of Colonel de la Silvière. Colonel Belville's Hanoverians were fed into the battle <b>to</b> <b>steady</b> the resolve of the dragoons, and once more went to the attack. The Allied progress was slow and hard, and like the defenders, they suffered many casualties.|$|E
5|$|One unique feature {{found on}} most MP 38 and MP 40 submachine guns was an aluminum, steel, or {{bakelite}} resting bar or support under the barrel. This was used <b>to</b> <b>steady</b> the weapon when firing {{over the side}} of open-top armored personnel carriers such as the Sdkfz 251 half-track. A handguard, made of a synthetic material derived from bakelite, was located between the magazine housing and the pistol grip. The barrel lacked any form of insulation, which often resulted in burns on the supporting hand if it was incorrectly positioned. The MP 40 also had a forward-folding metal stock, the first for a submachine gun, resulting in a shorter overall weapon when folded. However, this stock design was at times insufficiently durable for hard combat use.|$|E

5|$|The {{club has}} seen its share of struggles, {{both on and off}} the ice. The team has had two changes of ownership, from Firestone to Rod Bryden in 1993 due to the arena {{development}} process and its financing, and subsequently to Eugene Melnyk after the team filed for bankruptcy in 2003. On the ice, the club finished last in the League in its first four seasons. Changes in hockey management have led <b>to</b> <b>steady</b> improvement of the team's play, resulting in the team qualifying for the Stanley Cup playoffs in 11 of the last 12 seasons, winning the Presidents' Trophy in 2002–03 and making it to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{first half}} of the game is set on a whaler {{in the middle of a}} storm, and the {{conditions}} on the deck affect the degree of control the player has over Hansen. As the ship sways continuously from side to side, aiming is made more difficult, although Hansen can grab onto a ledge <b>to</b> <b>steady</b> himself, if one is available. In some instances, the ship can sway to such a degree that Hansen will slide towards the edge and potentially fall overboard. There are also numerous environmental hazards on the deck which react to the motion of the ship, such as swinging electrical wires and crates hooked up to ropes. If any of these items hit Hansen, he will lose health. Waves crashing on to the ship's deck can also cause Hansen damage.|$|E
5|$|Through a {{sharp and}} skilful tack, HMS Bellerophon, {{one of the}} slowest ships in the British van, succeeded in {{bringing}} the Révolutionnaire <b>to</b> <b>steady</b> action at 18:00. The ships exchanged fire for twenty minutes, the weaker Bellerophon taking severe damage to her rigging, and falling back {{to be replaced by}} HMS Marlborough under Captain George Cranfield Berkeley. Marlborough was joined by HMS Russell and HMS Thunderer, and between them they shot away much of the Révolutionnaire's rigging, so that by 19:30 she was unmanageable. HMS Leviathan also joined the action, firing at an unidentified ship ahead of Révolutionnaire. Concerned about Pasley's squadron becoming cut off from the main body of his fleet, Howe recalled them to the British line at 20:00. All complied except the newly arrived HMS Audacious under Captain William Parker. Audacious had engaged Révolutionnaire so closely that she could not safely withdraw, and although her gunnery eventually dismasted her huge opponent, Audacious took severe damage.|$|E

5|$|Using {{an anchor}} <b>to</b> <b>steady</b> his ship, Campbell placed Dart {{alongside}} the French frigate, with his bows between the French ship's masts. This allowed a boarding party led by Lieutenant James M'Dermeit to leap aboard Désirée {{and drive the}} French off the frigate's deck in hand-to-hand combat. M'Dermeit {{was wounded in the}} fighting, and called across for reinforcements as the French regrouped in the stern of the ship. Campbell used his anchors to swing Dart alongside the French frigate and a second boarding party under Lieutenant William Isaac Pearce charged aboard, routing the French reinforcements that were emerging from below decks. With the upper deck secure, Pearce severed the anchor cables, steered Désirée out of the harbour and over the sandbars that were rapidly being exposed by the receding tide. With his target captured, Campbell turned Dart towards the second British attack, against the head of the French line.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} crossings, steamers took the crowds from Circular Quay, although this time only four were needed, while another 600–700 people {{made their own}} way to the site. The ride was scheduled for 3 pm on 23 December, but delays meant L'Estrange did not appear until 6 pm. Although the length of rope was over 182 metres, it was only just over nine metres above the water. The stay wires were held in boats on either side, with the crews rowing against each other to keep it steady. L'Estrange rode his bicycle towards the centre, where, with the rope swinging to and fro, he stopped briefly <b>to</b> <b>steady</b> himself but instead, realising he was losing his balance, {{he was forced to}} leap from the rope and fell into the water below. Although he was unhurt, it was another knock to his reputation. A repeat attempt was announced for the following weekend. Again steamers took a dwindling crowd to Banbury Bay where they found L'Estrange's rope had been mysteriously cut, and he cancelled the performance. The Daily Telegraph reported that many in the crowd, who had paid for tickets on the steamers, felt they had been scammed.|$|E
5|$|At 10:38 on {{the morning}} of 21 June, Fury detonated a ground mine off Juno Beach during a gale and the navy decided to tow her into the British Mulberry harbour at Arromanches where her damage could be evaluated. While waiting for a tugboat, she took on a 6° list to {{starboard}} from flooding. The Dutch tug Thames began towing the ship at 13:25; at 21:14, Fury accidentally collided with the stern of a freighter anchored outside the Mulberry, damaging her port side above the waterline, and the towline snapped at 21:49 when she struck another ship several times. She let go her anchor after drifting clear, but it almost immediately started dragging under the pressure of the wind and waves and the salvage ship Lincoln Salvor was secured alongside <b>to</b> <b>steady</b> Fury. Another tug made a towline fast at 22:18, but it immediately snapped when the tug began to pull forward. Lincoln Salvor had to cast off as her wooden hull was being damaged by slamming into Furys hull and six other tugboats attempted to tow the destroyer clear of the shipping in the Mulberry, but they all failed. Fury struck at least three other ships, including petrol and ammunition ships before she was driven ashore at 01:30. Her crew was able to walk to Arromanches at about 05:30 once the tide went out.|$|E
