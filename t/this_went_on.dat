25|$|Many Ainur descended, taking {{physical}} form and becoming bound to that world. The greater Ainur {{became known as}} the Valar, while the lesser Ainur were called the Maiar. The Valar attempted to prepare the world for the coming inhabitants (Elves and Men), while Melkor, who wanted Arda for himself, repeatedly destroyed their work; <b>this</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> for thousands of years until, through waves of destruction and creation, the world took shape.|$|E
25|$|Linsingen Kaserne (named after General Alexander von Linsingen) {{was built}} in Hamelin in the 1930s; <b>this</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> to be Gordon Barracks. Meanwhile, at Herford, Estorff Kaserne (named after Major-General Ludwig von Estorff) and Stobbe Kaserne (named after Major-General Otto Stobbe) were built in 1934: these went on, after the war, to become Hammersmith Barracks and Wentworth Barracks respectively. Also at Herford Otto Weddigen Kaserne (named after Captain Otto Weddigen) was built around the same time: this became Harewood Barracks.|$|E

25|$|All <b>this</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> {{before the}} very {{eyes of the}} Sikhs which had sent shock waves across Punjab. The issue was {{effectively}} raised in The Akali (Punjabi), published from Lahore by Master Sunder Singh Lyallpuri (q.v.), father of the Akali movement and Shiromani Akali Dal. Lyallpuri belonged to Bohoru village close to Nankana Sahib and he personally preached against the supposed debauchery of the Mahant in the nearby villages and also continued to organize the Sikhs for a movement to bring reforms into the Gurdwaras.|$|E
25|$|Hildr welcomed {{her father}} and offered him peace and a {{necklace}} on behalf of Heðinn. However, Hǫgni had already unsheathed his sword Dáinsleif, which gave wounds that never healed and like Tyrfing always killed a man once it had been unsheathed. A battle ensued and they fought all day and many died. In the evening Heðinn and Hǫgni returned to their camps, but Hildr stayed on the battle-field. She resurrected them with incantations and the fallen soldiers started to fight anew, and <b>this</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> until Ragnarök.|$|E
25|$|Han, {{the weakest}} of the Seven Warring States, was {{adjacent}} to the much stronger Qin, and had suffered continuous assaults by Qin in earlier years of the Warring States period. <b>This</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> until Emperor Qin Shi Huang sent general Wang Jian to attack Zhao. King An of Han, frightened {{by the thought that}} Han would be the next target of the Qin state, immediately sent diplomats to surrender the entire kingdom without a fight, saving the Han populace from the terrible potential consequences of an unsuccessful resistance.|$|E

25|$|There is {{considerable}} myth surrounding {{the origins of}} Somananda. He claimed he was a descendent of the sage Durvasa. Durvasa received from Shiva the spiritual mission of keeping the tradition and secrets of Agamic Shaivism alive. It is said that Durvasa created his son, Tryambaka, directly from the mind (in a similar way {{with the creation of}} Athena directly from the mind of her father, Zeus, in the Greek mythology). In turn, Tryambaka also created a son directly from his mind. <b>This</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> for 15 generation terminating with the father of Sangamaditya, who took a woman as a wife. Then, there were three more generations until Somananda. So, Somananda claims a divine spiritual ancestry and investiture.|$|E
25|$|Word {{had spread}} through the East Side, by some magic of terror, that the plant of the Triangle Waist Company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped. Horrified and helpless, the crowds — I among them — {{looked up at the}} burning building, saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows, pause for a terrified moment, and then leap to the {{pavement}} below, to land as mangled, bloody pulp. <b>This</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> for what seemed a ghastly eternity. Occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and, screaming with clothing and hair ablaze, plunged like a living torch to the street. Life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} week of September 1918, {{retreating}} Armenians from Van came to the Bakubah refugee camp in parties of 1,000 or 2,000, by road and by train. Many of them were suffering from dysentery, typhus and relapsing fever, and there was a small epidemic of smallpox among the children. There were many who died along the road because of weakness and starvation. <b>This</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> through September and the first half of October, until about 40,000 had been received in all. Towards the end of September it was decided to raise four battalions from among the Armenians on the lines of an Indian infantry battalion. The 2nd Battalion was established by Van Armenians. The 3rd Battalion was established by Armenians from other regions. The G.O.C. North Persian Force decided to locate the 2nd Battalion around Senna, while the 3rd Battalion moved to Bijar.|$|E

25|$|When {{the novel}} 1632 {{was written in}} 1999, it was {{conceived}} as an experiment in the literary genre alternate history by Flint, without intentions of writing any immediate sequel. He had, in fact, several other years of writing projects planned, which subsequent developments were to delay as late as publication in 2006–2007. Flint—as a relatively new writer at the time, following the popular demand for a sequel, elected to invite other established authors in the Baen's stable of writers to share the universe in order to rapidly develop its potential—in this he traded on his experience as an editor. <b>This</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> concurrently {{with a great deal}} of reader input in what became the 1632 Tech sub-forum on Baen's Bar. In this initiative, he became the editor (he was already a Baen editor for the Baen Free Library) and together with fan input on Baen's Bar, and collaboration with established best-selling author David Weber on the first long sequel, 1633, concurrently put together the Ring of Fire anthology to inaugurate the short fiction in the series.|$|E

As early as 1956, Silver's piano playing was described by Down Beat as [...] "a key influence on {{a large segment of}} modern jazz pianists."

500|$|A thirty-eight-day {{strike in}} 1958 hurt The Inquirer and, after the strike ended, so many reporters had {{accepted}} buyout offers and left that the newsroom was noticeably empty. Furthermore, many current reporters had been copyclerks {{just before the}} strike and had little experience. One of the few star reporters of the 1950s and 1960s was investigative reporter Harry Karafin. During his career Harry Karafin exposed corruption and other exclusive stories for The Inquirer, but also extorted money out of individuals and organizations. Karafin would claim he had harmful information and would demand money {{in exchange for the}} information not being made public. <b>This</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> from the late 1950s into the early 1960s before Karafin was exposed in 1967 and convicted of extortion a year later.

500|$|Since {{finding the}} right actor to play Dimitri took such a long time, the show had already begun taping around the {{character}} for two weeks. Nader spent his first weeks on All My Children working overtime to catch up. [...] "By the time we had resolved some of the terms," [...] he said, [...] "they were really against the wall in terms of back story.... In retrospect, I should have just slept on the set because it was like sixty or seventy pages a day!" [...] Nader also taped his scenes out of sequence while dealing with sixteen different scripts from different points in the story. To keep each scene straight he gave them each a name that described the scene's main action. After those scenes were taped, they were spliced into the otherwise completed episodes. <b>This</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> for two weeks until the episodes were all caught up. Another complication Nader dealt with was the wardrobe. He said, [...] "They had devised this sort of 'tapestry' layered look for Dimitri {{and it was like}} doing scenes inside a sauna." [...] This was eventually rectified, but not before the actor lost around twelve pounds in the two weeks.|$|E
500|$|Hester's {{touchdown}} for the Bears on {{the opening}} kickoff {{was the first one}} in Super Bowl history, and the ninth kick return for a touchdown in a Super Bowl; only three of the nine teams who did <b>this</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> to win the game (the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXI, the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowls XXXV and XLVII, and the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII). Hester's return also kept a streak alive for there being a kickoff return for a touchdown in each Super Bowl played at Dolphin Stadium. [...] Hester's and Wayne's touchdowns in the first quarter marked the first time in Super Bowl history the first two touchdowns were scored by players from the same college (University of Miami). Jones was the Bears' top rusher with 112yards, while also catching four passes for 18yards. Desmond Clark was the Bears' top receiver with six receptions for 64yards. Grossman completed 20 of 28 passes for 165yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions, leaving him with a QB rating of 68.3 for the game. Muhsin Muhammad became the third player ever to score a touchdown in the Super Bowl for two different teams, joining Ricky Proehl and Jerry Rice.|$|E

With Cynthia Connolly and Leslie Clague, she compiled the seminal photographic punk oral history book Banned In DC in 1988, which documented the early 1980s Washington, DC hardcore punk scene.

500|$|Rififi was {{a popular}} success in France which led to several other Rififi films based on le Breton's stories. These films include Du rififi chez les femmes (1959), Du rififi à Tokyo (1961), and Du rififi à Paname (1965). On its United Kingdom release, Rififi was paired with the British science fiction film The Quatermass Xperiment as a double bill; <b>this</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> {{to be the most}} {{successful}} double-bill release in UK cinemas in all of 1955. The film was offered distribution in the United States on the condition that Dassin renounce his past, declaring that he was duped into subversive associations. Otherwise, his name would be removed from the film as the writer and director. Dassin refused and the film was released by United Artists who set up a dummy corporation as the distributing company. The film was distributed successfully in America with Dassin listed in the credits; in this way {{he was the first to}} break the Hollywood blacklist. Rififi was released in the United States first with subtitles and then later with an English dub under the title Rififi...Means Trouble!. The film caused controversy on its release from The Roman Catholic Legion of Decency. The film endured three brief cuts in it and opened with a title card quoting the Book of Proverbs stating [...] "When the wicked are multiplied, crime shall be multiplied: but the just shall see their downfall". After this change, the film passed with a B rating. In 2005, Variety announced that Stone Village Pictures had acquired the remake rights to Rififi, the producers intending to place the film in a modern setting with Al Pacino taking the lead role.|$|E
