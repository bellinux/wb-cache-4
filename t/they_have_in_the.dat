Another project working towards conservation is CenSeam, a Census of Marine Life project formed in 2005. CenSeam is intended to provide the framework needed to prioritise, integrate, expand and facilitate seamount research efforts in order to significantly reduce the unknown and build towards a global understanding of seamount ecosystems, and the roles <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> biogeography, biodiversity, productivity and evolution of marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|The Sauvignon blanc vine often buds late but ripens early, {{which allows}} it to perform well in sunny climates when not exposed to {{overwhelming}} heat. In warm regions such as South Africa, Australia and California, the grape flourishes in cooler climate appellations such as the Alexander Valley area. In areas where the vine is subjected to high heat, the grape will quickly become over-ripe and produce wines with dull flavors and flat acidity. Rising global temperatures have caused farmers to harvest the grapes earlier than <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past.|$|E

Indeed, they {{might be the only}} close relative of the puzzling firefly genus Pterotus, which sometimes is placed in a monotypic subfamily.|$|E

I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past.

Burton had requested certain jury instructions, which the trial judge had delivered. But, along with the requested instructions, the trial judge had stated that: [...] " [...] asked by counsel for the defendant to give certain declarations here, and while I think <b>they</b> <b>have,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main, been covered by the charge, yet I will give them to you[...] [...] [...] These are abstract propositions of law, which I give {{in connection with the}} charge, as perhaps more fully amplifying it.

500|$|After {{three years}} of touring and working with {{producer}} Ross Robinson, Machine Head released its third studio album, The Burning Red, on August 10, 1999. The band added new elements to its music, including rapping vocals, a move which some believe to {{have been influenced by}} Ahrue Luster himself. This album and the band's change in image/musical direction (nu metal/alternative metal) was highly criticized, with critics and fans alike accusing the band of [...] "selling out". Nevertheless, McClain stated they weren't trying to sound like popular bands but [...] "wanted to sound different". Rick Anderson of Allmusic stated Machine Head was [...] "sounding a bit looser and less constricted musically than <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past". The Burning Red became Machine Head's top selling album for a number of years, and debuted at number 88 on the Billboard 200.|$|E
500|$|Parker {{also said}} he and Stone {{purposely}} wrote the episode to present Jesus as the hero from a [...] "humanist approach"; Clasquin said this is demonstrated {{by the fact that}} Jesus becomes caught up in people's expectations for the fight and becomes offended when people bet against him: [...] "This satirical gesture beautifully draws attention to the sheer humanity of Jesus. He really is a man, just as we are men and women. He is open to fear and uncertainty." [...] Several writers said the episode also lampooned the way Americans can turn anything, even a religious situation, into a commercially hyped event. Matt Zoller Seitz of The Star-Ledger said: [...] "They aren't making fun of organized religion (though <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past). They're making fun of those who would turn religion into entertainment and entertainment into a kind of religion." [...] Seitz said the episode mocks [...] "morality cops who misbehave in private" [...] like Priest Maxi, who secretly bets the parish against Jesus even as he admonished congregation members for siding with Satan.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} find out the truth, the family turns to the Internet to {{discover}} more about the powers <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, but are accidentally sent to the game engine when Homer spills beer over the keyboard. There, they discover Will Wright, who is destroying copies of an old 8-bit The Simpsons game and its characters. The family manages to save their 8-bit predecessors before they are destroyed by Wright, and discover that they will also become obsolete when the next The Simpsons game is released. The only way to prevent this is to talk to the creator of the games and convince him not to destroy them. In order to access his mansion, the family needs to acquire four key cards from four upcoming Simpsons games. First, Homer and Marge defeat a two-headed dragon whose heads are those of Patty and Selma in the Neverquest game. Marge and Lisa then travel to Grand Theft Scratchy, eliminating all offensive material and replacing it with more family-friendly material. Next, Homer and Bart travel to France during World War II to thwart Mr. Burns' plan to steal priceless French paintings, in the [...] "Medal of Homer" [...] game. Lisa and Homer then travel to ancient Japan to defeat the evil Mr. Dirt and his [...] "Sparklemon" [...] in the Big Super Happy Fun Fun Game.|$|E

[...] However, he also declared that: [...] "as for the people, what thoughts <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> matter of religion in their own breasts I cannot reach; but I shall think it my duty, if they walk honestly and peaceably, not to cause them in the least to suffer for the same."

2500|$|The 1859 {{publication}} of Charles Darwin's theory {{of natural selection}} put forward an explanation for complexity and adaptation, which reflects scientific consensus {{on the origins of}} biological diversity. In the eyes of some, this provided a counter-argument to the watchmaker analogy: for example, the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins referred to the analogy in his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker giving his explanation of evolution. Others, however, consider the watchmaker analogy to be compatible with evolutionary creation, opining that the two concepts are not mutually exclusive. In the 19th century, deists, who championed the watchmaker analogy, held that Darwin's theory fit with [...] "the principle of uniformitarianism—the idea that all processes in the world occur now as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past" [...] and that deistic evolution [...] "provided an explanatory framework for understanding species variation in a mechanical universe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Now {{that the}} Galápagos green turtle is an {{endangered}} species, {{it has little}} economic significance for humans. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past been harvested from egg to adult phases for various human uses. [...] The eggs and meat from all life stages was used in many areas as a food source for humans, and the meat is still considered a delicacy in some countries of South America. [...] They were also harvested for their hides and for the oils of their fat deposits used in cooking, but the Galápagos green turtle has less body fat than other green turtles, so not as much oil was yielded from their bodies. Now the green turtles {{have more of a}} negative impact on human economics due to their status as endangered. They are often involved as bycatch in many ocean fisheries and are protected through many acts of legislation.|$|E

2500|$|On August 24, 2004, the Pan-Blue {{controlled}} Legislative Yuan approved legislation {{setting up}} the [...] "3–19 truth investigative commission" [...] to probe the shooting. According {{to the number of}} seats <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current 5th Legislative Yuan, each party will appoint members for the new commission. The commission will have the right to interview government officials and demand documents, and will be asked to present its findings to the legislature infinitely without time constraint. As part of the law, no one is permitted to elect silence or to influence the commission's investigation. The commission is also authorized to command a government prosecuting attorney, to unilaterally utilize the disaster reserve funds from the Executive Yuan, and to override court verdicts. Because such a law was suspected unconstitutional, the Pan-Green Coalition opposed the commission. Some Taiwanese nationals actually referred the commission as the [...] "3–19 truth in-the-making commission".|$|E

And with Snake Eyes, he’s such a strong inspiration for Jinx. We trained in the same dojo and he’s become an icon, he’s a role model. He’s Snake Eyes, he’s the coolest, he’s the best, and Jinx wants to compete with him, you know? In the test that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beginning she wants to win and she wants to prove that she wants to be better, or at least as good as him.

[...] Corliss included Tangled at 19 in a list of top 25 All-time Best Animated films. Kenneth Turan from the Los Angeles Times awarded the film four stars out of five; he described {{the film as}} a [...] "gorgeous computer-animated look that features rich landscapes and characters that look fuller and more lifelike than <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past."

[...] Rich Meehan replaced Shapiro as the executive producer. Casting for the season concluded on May 5, 2007. Grodner later promised fans of the series that Big Brother 8 would be more interactive, commenting [...] "It's not just about sitting down and watching television [...] We're a summer event that's always with you.
