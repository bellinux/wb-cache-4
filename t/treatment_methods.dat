5|$|The BDI was {{originally}} developed {{to provide a}} quantitative assessment of the intensity of depression. Because {{it is designed to}} reflect the depth of depression, it can monitor changes over time and provide an objective measure for judging improvement and the effectiveness or otherwise of <b>treatment</b> <b>methods.</b> The instrument remains widely used in research; in 1998, it had been used in over 2000 empirical studies. It has been translated into multiple European languages as well as Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Persian, and Xhosa.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in the nineteenth century, OFC is currently detected {{through a combination of}} blood testing, X-rays, and tissue sampling. Before 1950, around half of those diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism in the United States saw it progress to OFC, but with early identification techniques and improved <b>treatment</b> <b>methods,</b> instances of OFC in developed countries are increasingly rare. Where treatment is required, it normally involves addressing the underlying hyperparathyroidism before commencing long-term treatment for OFCdepending on its cause and severity, this can range from hydration and exercise to surgical intervention.|$|E
5|$|While Gascoigne was {{successful}} {{on the football}} field, his childhood was marked by instability and tragedy.

When he was ten, Gascoigne witnessed the death of Steven Spraggon, the younger brother of a friend, {{who was killed in}} a traffic collision. Around this time, his father began to suffer from seizures. Gascoigne began developing obsessions and twitches, and was taken into therapy at age ten, but soon quit the therapy sessions after his father expressed doubts over the <b>treatment</b> <b>methods.</b>|$|E

5|$|Eli Todd {{was born}} in 1769 in New Haven, Connecticut. He had two sisters, named Polly and Eunice. His mother was Mary Rowe, and his father, a New Haven merchant, died in 1776, {{a few months before}} his 7th birthday. He was then sent to live with his great uncle, Reverend Dr. Todd, who resided in East Guilford, in the same state. He {{remained}} with Reverend Dr. Todd until he was ten, when he was then under the care and instruction of Reverend Dr. Goodrich, of Durham, Connecticut, during which time he was introduced to the practice of medicine. He began to attend Yale University at the age of fourteen in 1783, and graduated with honors at the age of eighteen in 1787. His graduation was a significant milestone in his medical career. He studied medicine as an apprentice under Dr. Ebenezer Beardsley of New Haven, and began his own medical practice in Farmington at the age of 21. He soon became the favorite practitioner of the wealthy class in the community. He used gentle <b>treatment</b> <b>methods</b> as opposed to the harsh remedies commonly used at that time. Todd was 23 years old when he established Hospital Rock on Rattlesnake Mountain. He helped found the Hartford County and Connecticut Medical Societies, and was later a member of the Conversation Club. He also founded the Society of Medical Friends in Farmington, where doctors from around Connecticut could share treatments and discuss opinions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a cost-effective modified primary <b>treatment</b> <b>method</b> which can significantly increase the removal of both finely-divided and soluble organic matter without resorting to the use of any chemical coagulants or secondary <b>treatment</b> <b>method.</b> It involves the recycling of {{a small portion of the}} settled primary sludge and then mixing it, after brief aeration, with raw sewage for a short period to induce biosorption and flocculation/enmeshment of various types of pollutants, thereby settling them together with the recycled sludge particles. During operation, the raw sewage is NOT subjected to any aeration; only a small aeration tank for sludge pre-aeration and a flocculation tank for sludge-sewage mixing are added; thus, the energy for the improved <b>treatment</b> <b>method</b> will not be too much higher than the conventional primary <b>treatment</b> <b>method.</b> Yet, the removal of both COD and SS can be improved significantly as compared to the conventional method. The increased removal is mainly attributed to the effective biosorption/flocculation and settling of colloidal particles and this suggestion has been substantiated by the data of particle analysis...|$|R
