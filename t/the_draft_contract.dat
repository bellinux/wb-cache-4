They owned the Bwllfa Colliery in the Aberdare Valley (see above) {{and since the}} {{beginning}} of 1870 had supplied coal weekly to the Metropolitan Railway at favourable prices. A draft contract had been initialled by Alexander but never formally completed and Alexander decided to cease deliveries without notice. The Metropolitan held that <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> <b>contract</b> was valid and had been breached. A case was tried at the Surrey Spring Assizes (1873), The Court of Common Pleas and the House of Lords (1877), each of which held for the Metropolitan.

50|$|The normal {{practice}} {{is for the}} buyer to negotiate an agreed price with the seller then organise a survey and have the solicitor (or conveyancer) carry out their searches and pre-contract enquiries. The seller's solicitor or conveyancer will prepare <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> <b>contract</b> {{to be approved by}} the buyer's solicitor. The seller's solicitor will also collect and prepare property information to be provided to the buyer's solicitors, in line with the Law Society's National Protocol for domestic conveyancing. When undertaking property transactions, the conveyancer’s role is to carry out due diligence by submitting queries - known as Conveyancing Searches - about the transacted property. These are designed to uncover factors the estate agent or surveyor may not know about, which could impact the buyer’s enjoyment of the property.|$|E

He also attempted to prosecute members of the judiciary who had ruled in political trials under the communist regime. The plan was unequivocally rejected by Slovakia's top judicial authorities, who argued that the law, if passed, would come much too late. [...] In connection with the withdrawal of KDH from the ruling coalition on 7 February 2006, all KDH cabinet ministers resigned. Subsequently, on 8 February he was replaced as of Minister of Justice by Lucia Zitnanska from the SDKU. [...] This political move KDH was associated with disapproval of <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> <b>contract</b> between the Slovak Republic and the Holy See regarding the right to objection of conscience, which concerns the armed forces, health, education and training, legal services and labor relations. In early parliamentary elections, held on 17 June 2006, the KDH {{became part of the}} opposition.

40|$|Abstract Contracts {{between local}} {{government}} and private investment agencies {{play an important role}} in strategic urban projects. Real estate cycles provide only a narrow window of opportunity within which to <b>draft</b> such <b>contracts.</b> A legal system should therefore not impede the possibility of reaching an agreement quickly; instead, it should facilitate efficient ways of reaching an agreement. Lengthy contracting may contribute to the persistence of real estate market cycles. This paper explores the question of whether the civil-law principle of good faith facilitates <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> of incomplete <b>contracts,</b> which may be efficient in situations of high uncertainty and complexity, as was the case with two strategic inner-city projects: the South Axis in Amsterdam and Battery Park City in New York City. The paper further establishes that good faith does play a considerable role in the differences in contracting practice. 1...|$|R
