5|$|FBI Special Agents Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), Terry Lake (Sabrina Lloyd) and David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) {{investigate}} a serial rapist who has begun killing his victims. With the twelfth victim, Karen Silber (Kate Norby), changing her story {{again and the}} thirteenth victim's car missing, Don runs out of viable leads. Taking a map and a case file with him, Don goes to his childhood home, owned by his father Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), to take a shower. Don's younger brother, Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) of CalSci's mathematics department, finds and studies the map which Don lays {{on the dining room}} table. As Don prepares to return to the office, Charlie tries to talk Don into letting him help with the investigation and is inspired by the pattern of drops emanating from the family's sprinkler. He tells Don that he can use a mathematical model to find <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>where</b> the rapist resides. Skeptical, Don agrees to let Charlie assist him in the investigation.|$|E

Carr pitched the book as non-fiction, because he was afraid his agent and editor would not accept a fiction book from a non-fiction author. Only when the publisher was on the verge of buying the book did he reveal the truth.|$|E
25|$|The first {{railway station}} of Rouen {{was built on}} the left bank in 1843. The {{government}} authorized the continuation of the line to Le Havre and Dieppe the same year. It was therefore decided to build a bridge {{to the end of the}} Brouilly island (now connected to the Lacroix island), leading to the tunnel under the Côte Sainte-Catherine. The bridge, located in the Rouen metropolitan area, linking Paris and Le Havre, was named the English Bridge because many workers who built it were of English nationality. It is also called the Viaduc d'Eauplet, after <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>where</b> it is located.|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} CCP technique can {{be applied}} to nearly all LBP features and their extensions. The CCP-based feature extraction has two steps. Firstly, the local binary code of each neighborhood is computed by a LBP operator. Secondly, the codes are divided into two categories according to CCP. After that, the original feature histogram of an image is decomposed into two parts, which are called the concave histogram (the statistics of <b>the</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>where</b> μi,j[*]<[*]μ) and <b>the</b> convex histogram (the statistics of <b>the</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>where</b> μi,j[*]≥[*]μ).|$|R

25|$|The rapes {{occurred}} on Saturday, January 8, 1949, after Ruby Stroud Floyd, a 32-year-old white woman, entered a black neighborhood in Martinsville, Virginia to collect money for clothing she had sold. She previously distributed Jehovah's Witnesses {{materials in the}} neighborhood. Residents warned her not to stay too long, noting the time as late afternoon. She passed four men at the railroad tracks and continued into <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> <b>where</b> she was later assaulted by some of those four and other men. At 7:30p.m., after dark, she went to Mary Wade's house for shelter, showing signs of an assault. The Wades called an ambulance for her.|$|E
25|$|Born in 1953, Zico {{came from}} a lower-middle-class family of Portuguese origin, in the {{neighborhood}} of Quintino Bocaiúva, Rio de Janeiro. In common with many young Brazilians, he spent much of his youth dreaming of being a professional footballer and cutting classes to play football on the streets. His passion for the sport made him famous in <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> <b>where</b> people would gather to see the boy's brilliant performances against older children and teenagers. At that time he was playing for Juventude, a local futsal street team run by his older brothers and friends, and had also begun to play for futsal club River Futebol Clube on Sundays.|$|E
25|$|The Teatro Puerto Rico {{was music}} hall focused into the Latino {{community}} in the South Bronx section of New York City. During the 1940s to 1950s it precented la farándula, a vaudeville-style package of Spanish-language events, and attracted entertainers from all over Latin America. In the late 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>where</b> the theater was located was in decline and the theater closed its doors until 1994. That year {{a real estate developer}} invested funds in renovations. After two years in operation, a political scandal involving misappropriated public funds forced the permanent closure of the theater as such. The building which the theater once occupied, however, is now being used as a place of religious worship.|$|E

25|$|Investigators and the {{prosecution}} suggested during pre-trial motions that Muhammad intended to kill his second ex-wife Mildred, who had estranged him from his children. According to this theory, the other shootings were intended {{to cover up the}} motive for the crime, since Muhammad believed that the police would not focus on an estranged ex-husband as a suspect if she looked like a random victim of a serial killer. Muhammad frequented <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>where</b> she lived during the attacks, and some of the incidents occurred nearby. Additionally, he had earlier made threats against her. Mildred herself made the claim that she was his intended target. However, Judge LeRoy Millette, Jr. prevented prosecutors from presenting that theory during the trial, saying that a link had not been firmly established.|$|E

[...] By 1971, the golf course {{was replaced by the}} North Shore Towers. The North Shore Towers were constructed in Glen Oaks because of Queens's lax zoning rules, which are less restrictive than those in Nassau and Suffolk Counties in Long Island. Some Glen Oaks residents, mostly single-home dwellers, protested the construction of the North Shore Towers because they were afraid it would dominate the horizon.

500|$|J. D. B. was a 13-year-old student {{attending}} Smith Middle School in Chapel Hill, North Carolina when he {{was taken}} out of class by a uniformed police officer and questioned. J. D. B. had been questioned previously by the police when they saw him in <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>where</b> two home break-ins had occurred. [...] After questioning J. D. B. the first time, police learned that a digital camera matching the description of a stolen item had been seen in the possession of J. D. B. This prompted the juvenile investigator assigned to the case to go to the school to question J. D. B. Upon arriving at the school, the investigator informed the uniformed police officer on detail at the school and members of the school's administration. The uniformed officer interrupted the class J. D. B. was in and escorted him to a school conference room, where J. D. B. was subsequently questioned by the investigator, police officer, and members of the schools administration for 30 to 45 minutes. Prior to the questioning, J. D. B. was neither given Miranda warnings nor an opportunity to speak to his legal guardian, nor was he informed that he was free to leave the room.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} BART Police Officer Johannes Mehserle's shooting of Oscar Grant on New Year's Morning 2009, and the ensuing reaction by the Alameda County District Attorney's office, justice activists and community members organized response actions and demonstrations. [...] On January 7, about 200 people marched in protest into Oakland's Central Business District. [...] Some became violent and began rioting. [...] Police lines pushed the rioting east from Downtown along 14th Street and into <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> <b>where</b> rioters continued rioting on Jackson Street and Madison Street. [...] After helicopter-mounted television cameras broadcast images of rioters smashing the windows at a McDonald's restaurant at 14th and Jackson, the rioting briefly wound down after Mayor Ron Dellums and other Oakland leaders {{came out to the}} scene to plead with the crowd for calm.

Although many Oakland citizens had stepped forward to help {{at the scene of}} the motorcycle police shootings, about 20 bystanders had taunted police as they gathered at the scene.
