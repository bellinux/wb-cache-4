5|$|A {{point in}} the unit {{interval}} lies in the Cantor set {{if and only if}} it can be represented in <b>ternary</b> using only the digits 0 and 2.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} <b>ternary</b> {{fluorides}} are {{known of the}} form A7Cm6F31, where A stands for alkali metal.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{a number}} of <b>ternary</b> oxides of the type M(II)CmO3 are known, where M stands for a {{divalent}} metal, such as barium.|$|E
5|$|Third dance {{movement}} (Scherzo or minuet) in the tonic, {{in overall}} A–B–A <b>ternary</b> form, with a trio in either <b>ternary</b> or binary form, {{and in a}} conventionally related key (relative major, subdominant, and parallel minor respectively). They are based on their sonata's first movements, with a similar tonal scheme and/or motivic reference. The B section of each piece features tonalities serving important dramatic functions in previous movements. Each features animated, playful figurations for the right hand and abrupt changes in register.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{additional}} alkali and alkaline neptunium oxide compounds such as Cs4Np5O17 and Cs2Np3O10 have been characterized with various production methods. Neptunium has also been observed to form <b>ternary</b> oxides with many additional elements in groups 3 through 7, although these compounds are much less well studied.|$|E
5|$|An alloy {{of sodium}} and potassium, NaK is a liquid {{used as a}} heat-transfer medium and a {{desiccant}} for producing dry and air-free solvents. It {{can also be used}} in reactive distillation. The <b>ternary</b> alloy of 12% Na, 47% K and 41% Cs has the lowest melting point of −78°C of any metallic compound.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's études {{are largely}} in {{straightforward}} <b>ternary</b> form. He {{used them to}} teach his own technique of piano playing—for instance playing double thirds (Op.25, No.6), playing in octaves (Op.25, No.10), and playing repeated notes (Op.10, No. 7).|$|E
5|$|Slow second movement, {{in a key}} {{different}} from the tonic, and in A–B–A (<b>ternary)</b> or A–B–A–B–A form. The main sections (A and B) are contrasted in key and character, A is slow and meditative; B is more intense and animated. The movement begins and ends slowly and quietly.|$|E
5|$|The form of {{the second}} {{movement}}, an Andante in B-flat major, is indefinable. The movement involves elements of a theme and variations, but also has characteristics of both a <b>ternary</b> form movement and a rondo. Unlike a conventional theme and variation movement, the minor mode variation is placed immediately after the statement of the theme; normally, the minor mode theme would be held back for later in the movement. The second variation involves very little actual variation, and is closer to a literal re-statement of the theme that one would see in <b>ternary</b> form or a rondo. Also unconventionally, {{the second and third}} so-called variations are separated by an eight-measure free-form passage. The cello enjoys a prominent role throughout the movement, with the viola often substituting as the bass accompaniment. The cello also presents the movement's opening theme.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ternary</b> berkelium(IV) {{chloride}} Cs2BkCl6 {{is obtained}} by dissolving berkelium(IV) hydroxide in a chilled solution of caesium chloride in concentrated hydrochloric acid. It forms orange hexagonal crystals with the lattice constants a = 745.1 pm and c = 1209.7 pm. The average {{radius of the}} BkCl62− ion in this compound is estimated as 270 pm.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's mazurkas and waltzes {{are all in}} {{straightforward}} <b>ternary</b> or episodic form, {{sometimes with}} a coda. The mazurkas often show more folk features than many of his other works, sometimes including modal scales and harmonies {{and the use of}} drone basses. However, some also show unusual sophistication, for example Op.63 No.3, which includes a canon at one beat's distance, a great rarity in music.|$|E
5|$|Most other binary alloys are {{of little}} use: for example, silver–gold alloys are too soft and silver–cadmium alloys too toxic. <b>Ternary</b> alloys have much greater importance: dental {{amalgams}} are usually silver–tin–mercury alloys, silver–copper–gold alloys {{are very important}} in jewellery (usually on the gold-rich side) and have a vast range of hardnesses and colours, silver–copper–zinc alloys are useful as low-melting brazing alloys, and silver–cadmium–indium (involving three adjacent elements on the periodic table) is useful in nuclear reactors because of its high thermal neutron capture cross-section, good conduction of heat, mechanical stability, and resistance to corrosion in hot water.|$|E
5|$|Ravel drew on {{many generations}} of French composers from Couperin and Rameau to Fauré {{and the more}} recent {{innovations}} of Satie and Debussy. Foreign influences include Mozart, Schubert, Liszt and Chopin. He considered himself {{in many ways a}} classicist, often using traditional structures and forms, such as the <b>ternary,</b> to present his new melodic and rhythmic content and innovative harmonies. The influence of jazz on his later music is heard within conventional classical structures in the Piano Concerto and the Violin Sonata.|$|E
5|$|The cycle {{consists}} of sixteen sonatas (thirteen {{of which are}} cast in binary form, the remaining three in <b>ternary</b> form) and four more freely structured interludes. The aim of the pieces is to express the eight permanent emotions of the rasa Indian tradition. In Sonatas and Interludes, Cage elevated his technique of rhythmic proportions {{to a new level}} of complexity. In each sonata a short sequence of natural numbers and fractions defines the structure of the work and that of its parts, informing structures as localized as individual melodic lines.|$|E
5|$|III. Menuetto: Allegro – Trio. This is {{a somber}} movement, quite {{distinct}} from the typical atmosphere of dance movements. It is relatively conservative in its key scheme, moving to the relative major key {{and back to the}} tonic. In the B section, a sequence of hemiolas is interrupted by a dramatic interpolation in A-flat major, referencing the departure to this key in the opening of the Allegro with the added minor 6th. The second A section is a transformation of the first, interrupted every four bars by a silent bar, creating a mysterious atmosphere. The trio is in A-flat major, <b>ternary</b> form, with a B section beginning in E-flat major colored by its own minor 6th, and modulating to G-flat major via the parallel minor.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, {{research}} chemists in Heilmeier {{group at}} RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed {{only in the}} number of carbon atoms in the terminal side chains could yield room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A <b>ternary</b> mixture of Schiff base compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22–105°C. Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made. The team then proceeded to prepare numerous mixtures of nematic compounds many of which had much lower melting points. This technique of mixing nematic compounds to obtain wide operating temperature range eventually became the industry standard and is used to this very day to tailor materials to meet specific applications.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} also react {{similarly}} with hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal hydrides, where the hydride anion {{acts as a}} pseudohalide: these are often used as reducing agents, producing hydrides, complex metal hydrides, or hydrogen gas. Other pseudohalides are also known, notably the cyanides. These are isostructural to the respective halides except for lithium cyanide, indicating that the cyanide ions may rotate freely. <b>Ternary</b> alkali metal halide oxides, such as Na3ClO, K3BrO (yellow), Na4Br2O, Na4I2O, and K4Br2O, are also known. The polyhalides are rather unstable, although those of rubidium and caesium are greatly stabilised by the feeble polarising power of these extremely large cations.|$|E
5|$|The bassoon sustains its B {{from the}} final chord of the first {{movement}} before moving up a semitone to middle C. This serves as a key change from the E minor opening movement into the lyrical C major slow movement. The movement is in <b>ternary</b> form and is reminiscent of Mendelssohn's own Songs Without Words. The theme to the darker, middle section in A minor is first introduced by the orchestra before the violin then takes up both the melody and the accompaniment simultaneously. The tremulous accompaniment requires nimble dexterity from the soloist before the music returns to the main lyrical C major theme, this time leading towards a serene conclusion.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ternary</b> and {{balanced}} <b>ternary</b> systems have sometimes been used. They are both base3 systems.|$|E
25|$|Balanced <b>ternary</b> {{is unusual}} in having the digit values 1, 0 and –1. Balanced <b>ternary</b> {{turns out to have}} some useful {{properties}} and the system has been used in the experimental Russian Setun computers.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} is cast in through-composed <b>ternary</b> form (ABA).|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} is cast in <b>ternary</b> form (ABA) with a literal repeat and terse extension (coda).|$|E
25|$|Barycentric {{coordinates}} as {{used for}} <b>ternary</b> plots and more generally {{in the analysis}} of triangles.|$|E
25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{an operator}} {{form of an}} if statement, such as C's <b>ternary</b> operator.|$|E
25|$|Through {{consideration}} of this set, Cantor and others helped lay {{the foundations of}} modern point-set topology. Although Cantor himself defined the set in a general, abstract way, the most common modern construction is the Cantor <b>ternary</b> set, built by removing the middle thirds of a line segment. Cantor himself mentioned the <b>ternary</b> construction only in passing, {{as an example of}} a more general idea, that of a perfect set that is nowhere dense.|$|E
25|$|Simplices {{are used}} in {{plotting}} quantities that sum to 1, such as proportions of subpopulations, as in a <b>ternary</b> plot.|$|E
25|$|Other {{methods of}} {{separation}} involve introducing an additional agent, called an entrainer, {{that will affect}} the volatility {{of one of the}} azeotrope constituents more than another. When an entrainer is added to a binary azeotrope to form a <b>ternary</b> azeotrope, and the resulting mixture distilled, the method is called azeotropic distillation. The best known example is adding benzene or cyclohexane to the water/ethanol azeotrope. With cyclohexane as the entrainer, the <b>ternary</b> azeotrope is 7% water, 17% ethanol, and 76% cyclohexane, and boils at 62.1°C. Just enough cyclohexane is added to the water/ethanol azeotrope to engage all of the water into the <b>ternary</b> azeotrope. When the mixture is then boiled, the azeotrope vaporizes leaving a residue composed almost entirely of the excess ethanol.|$|E
25|$|When condensed, {{this becomes}} a {{two-phase}} liquid mixture. The heavier phase, {{poor in the}} entrainer (benzene or cyclohexane), is stripped of the entrainer and recycled to the feed—while the lighter phase, with condensate from the stripping, is recycled to the second column. Another early method, called extractive distillation, consists of adding a <b>ternary</b> component that increases ethanol's relative volatility. When the <b>ternary</b> mixture is distilled, it produces anhydrous ethanol on the top stream of the column.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} is a scherzo in through-composed <b>ternary</b> form (ABA). A scurrying coda leads without a {{break into the}} next movement.|$|E
25|$|The set of all {{primitive}} Pythagorean triples forms a rooted <b>ternary</b> tree in {{a natural}} way; see Tree of primitive Pythagorean triples.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene {{hydration}} or brewing {{produces an}} ethanol–water mixture. For most industrial and fuel uses, the ethanol must be purified. Fractional distillation at atmospheric pressure can concentrate ethanol to 95.6% by weight (89.5 mole%). This mixture is an azeotrope with a boiling point of , and cannot be further purified by distillation. Addition of an entraining agent, such as benzene, cyclohexane, or heptane, allows a new <b>ternary</b> azeotrope comprising the ethanol, water, and the entraining agent to be formed. This lower-boiling <b>ternary</b> azeotrope is removed preferentially, leading to water-free ethanol.|$|E
25|$|Fission {{is a form}} {{of nuclear}} {{transmutation}} because the resulting fragments are not the same element as the original atom. The two nuclei produced are most often of comparable but slightly different sizes, typically with a mass ratio of products of about 3 to 2, for common fissile isotopes. Most fissions are binary fissions (producing two charged fragments), but occasionally (2 to 4 times per 1000 events), three positively charged fragments are produced, in a <b>ternary</b> fission. The smallest of these fragments in <b>ternary</b> processes ranges in size from a proton to an argon nucleus.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} structural {{hypothesis was}} that of <b>ternary</b> branching seen in (9a) and (9b), but following from Kayne's 1981 analysis, Larson maintained that each complement is introduced by a verb.|$|E
25|$|Lambek (1961) took Melzak's <b>ternary</b> {{model and}} {{atomized}} {{it down to}} the two unary instructions—X+, X- if possible else jump—exactly the same two that Minsky (1961) had come up with.|$|E
25|$|Azeotropes {{consisting}} of two constituents, such as the two examples above, are called binary azeotropes. Those {{consisting of}} three constituents are called <b>ternary</b> azeotropes. Azeotropes of more than three constituents are also known.|$|E
25|$|CPT binds to the topo I and DNA complex (the {{covalent}} complex) {{resulting in}} a <b>ternary</b> complex, and thereby stabilizing it. This prevents DNA re-ligation and therefore causes DNA damage which results in apoptosis.|$|E
