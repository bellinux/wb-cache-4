5|$|Carolina wrens {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their time on or near the ground searching for food, or in tangles of vegetation and vines. They also probe bark crevices on lower tree levels, or pick up leaf-litter in order to search for prey. <b>Their</b> <b>diet</b> consists of invertebrates, such as beetles, true bugs, grasshoppers, katydids, spiders, ants, bees, and wasps. Small lizards and tree frogs also make up the carnivorous portion of <b>their</b> <b>diet.</b> Vegetable matter makes up a small percentage of their diets, such as fruit pulp and various seeds. In the northern portion of their range, they frequent bird feeders.|$|E
5|$|In Dalmatia, {{the golden}} jackal's diet {{consists}} of mammals, fruits, vegetables, insects, birds and their eggs, grasses and leaves. Jackals change <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> to {{more readily available}} foods. In Serbia, <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> is primarily livestock carcasses that are increasingly prevalent {{due to a lack}} of removal, and this may have led to the expansion of their population. In Hungary, 55% of <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> is composed of common voles and bank voles, and 41% is composed of wild boar carcasses. Information on the diet of the golden jackal in northeastern Italy is scant, but it is known to prey on small roe deer and hares. In Israel, golden jackals are significant predators of snakes; during a poisoning campaign against golden jackals there was an increase in human snakebite reports, but a decrease when the poisoning ceased.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the most}} frugivorous {{members of the}} family Lemuridae, {{consuming}} an average of 74–90% fruit, ruffed lemurs also consume nectar (4–21%), and supplement the rest of <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> with young leaves (3–6%), mature leaves (1%), flowers (3–6%), and some seeds. Ruffed lemurs have also been reported to come to the ground to eat fungi and exhibit geophagy.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the giant}} panda, they cannot digest cellulose, {{so they must}} consume a large volume of bamboo to survive. <b>Their</b> <b>diets</b> consist of about two-thirds bamboo, but they also eat mushrooms, roots, acorns, lichens, and grasses. Occasionally, they {{supplement}} <b>their</b> <b>diets</b> with fish and insects. They {{do little more than}} eat and sleep due to <b>their</b> low-calorie <b>diets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Based {{on where}} these four-toed {{elephant}} shrews live, <b>their</b> main <b>diets</b> can vary. In Kenya, <b>their</b> <b>diets</b> include termites, plant matter, centipedes, ants, crickets and cockroaches, millipedes, spiders, {{and other similar}} creatures.|$|R
50|$|<b>Their</b> <b>diets</b> consist {{primarily}} of small mammals, especially rats and bandicoots.|$|R
5|$|By 300CE {{some of the}} archaic groups {{developed}} into an early branch of seminomadic Anasazi, the Basketmakers. Basketmaker sites have grass- or stone-lined storage cists and shallow, partially underground dwellings called pithouses. They were hunters and gatherers who supplemented <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> with limited agriculture. Locally collected pine nuts were important for food and trade.|$|E
5|$|Chestnut sparrows are gregarious, and {{are only}} {{occasionally}} found away from flocks. They frequently associate with queleas and other weavers. Adults feed on grass seeds, and those near human habitations will also eat crumbs and other household scraps. Nestlings are fed mostly softer grass seeds, and small beetles are also recorded in <b>their</b> <b>diet.</b>|$|E
5|$|Common ravens are {{omnivorous}} {{and highly}} opportunistic: <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> may vary widely with location, season and serendipity. For example, those foraging on tundra on the Arctic North Slope of Alaska obtained about half their energy needs from predation, mainly of microtine rodents, and half by scavenging, mainly of caribou and ptarmigan carcasses.|$|E

5|$|Fruit trees do {{not appear}} to be {{selected}} by species, but by availability and accessibility of edible fruit. And despite predominance of a few plant species in the ruffed lemur diet, the remainder of <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> consists of between 80 and 132 other species from 36 plant families.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 it was {{estimated}} that there were 10,000 foxes in London. City-dwelling foxes may have the potential to consistently grow larger than their rural counterparts, as a result of abundant scraps and a relative dearth of predators. In cities foxes may scavenge food from litter bins and bin bags, although much of <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> will be similar to rural foxes.|$|E
5|$|Lead may {{be found}} in food when food is grown in soil that is high in lead, {{airborne}} lead contaminates the crops, animals eat lead in <b>their</b> <b>diet,</b> or lead enters the food either from what it was stored or cooked in.|$|E
50|$|<b>Their</b> <b>diets</b> consist {{primarily}} of arthropods, with larger animals eating snails and small mammals.|$|R

5|$|The 100-Mile Diet: A Year of Local Eating (or Plenty: One Man, One Woman, and a Raucous Year of Eating Locally) is a non-fiction {{book written}} by Canadian writers Alisa Smith and J.B. MacKinnon. In the book, the authors recount their experiences, {{including}} motivations and challenges, on restricting <b>their</b> <b>diet,</b> for one year, to include only foods grown within 100 miles of their residence. Beginning in March 2005, with little preparation the urban couple began only purchasing foods with ingredients they knew were all from within 100 miles. Finding little in grocery stores, {{they relied on}} farmers' markets and visits to local farms. Staples in <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> included seafood, chicken, root vegetable, berries, and corn. They lacked cooking oils, rice, and sugar. They preserved foods {{for use in the}} winter but ended with extra supplies.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{begins its}} breeding season {{later in the}} year than any other finch and later than any other native North American bird, besides occasionally the sedge wren. This {{may be related to the}} abundance of seeds in the late summer months, as seeds represent the majority of <b>their</b> <b>diet.</b>|$|E
5|$|The family Trogonidae {{includes}} the trogons and quetzals. Found in tropical woodlands worldwide, they feed on insects and fruit, and their broad bills and weak legs reflect <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they {{are reluctant to}} fly any distance. Trogons have soft, often colourful, feathers with distinctive male and female plumage.|$|E

5|$|The melampittas are insectivores, {{although}} {{in the case of}} the greater melampitta, this statement is inference as <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> isn't described. All that is known is that it sticks to the ground and understory. The lesser melampitta feeds on insects as well as worms, snails, small frogs and even small fruit. It forages on the ground, probing through leaves by flipping them with its bill.|$|E
5|$|<b>Their</b> <b>diet</b> {{consists}} {{primarily of}} small aquatic prey, such as insects and small fishes. Crayfish are its preferred food in most regions, {{but it can}} adjust its diet according to the habitat and prey abundance. Its main foraging behavior is probing with its beak {{at the bottom of}} shallow water to feel for and capture its prey. It does not see the prey.|$|E
5|$|Wolves {{supplement}} <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> {{with fruit}} and vegetable matter. They willingly eat the berries of mountain ash, lily of the valley, bilberries, blueberries and cowberry. Other fruits include nightshade, apples and pears. They readily visit melon fields during the summer months. A well-fed wolf stores fat under the skin, around the heart, intestines, kidneys, and bone marrow, particularly during the autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{this ability}} to digest food outside the body, starfish can hunt prey much larger than <b>their</b> mouths. <b>Their</b> <b>diets</b> include clams and oysters, arthropods, small fish and {{gastropod}} molluscs. Some starfish are not pure carnivores, supplementing <b>their</b> <b>diets</b> with algae or organic detritus. Some of these species are grazers, but others trap food particles from the water in sticky mucus strands that are swept towards the mouth along ciliated grooves.|$|R
30|$|This is a {{cross-sectional}} {{analysis of a}} follow-up study to examine the perceptions of mothers treated at public health centers, regarding <b>their</b> own <b>diets</b> and the <b>diets</b> of <b>their</b> children aged 2 – 3. Among the 464 participants, 57 % (n[*]=[*] 267) reported perceiving <b>their</b> own <b>diets</b> as unhealthy while 72 % (n[*]=[*] 334) perceiving <b>their</b> children’s <b>diets</b> as healthy. The mothers’ perceptions of <b>their</b> own <b>diets</b> as healthy were associated with less maternal schooling and having received health care from professionals who had received special training (p[*]<[*] 0.05). The mothers’ perceptions of <b>their</b> children’s <b>diets</b> as healthy were associated with more maternal schooling (p[*]<[*] 0.05). This difference between the mothers’ perceptions of <b>their</b> own <b>diets</b> and those of their children reinforce the importance of considering maternal beliefs and attitudes in infant nutritional intervention programs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Their</b> <b>diets</b> {{consist of}} small mammals, lizards, and {{sometimes}} frogs. They {{are often more}} active at colder temperatures than other rattlesnake species.|$|R
5|$|Yellow-bellied marmots are diurnal, and {{are less}} active during the night. They are omnivores, but {{generally}} eat {{a wide variety of}} plants, as they are generalist herbivores.They mostly feed on grass, grains, leaves, flowers, legumes, bird eggs, and insects. Occasionally, they are also known to eat fruits and bark of fruit trees. In food choice experiments, yellow-bellied marmots are known to reject plants containing defensive compounds. Due to this, they consume flowers of lupinus, larkspur, and columbine, but avoid their shoots containing toxic compounds. Their food choice depends upon the fatty acid and protein concentrations, which are well present in cinquefoil, cow-parsnip, and leaves of dandelion, which are also present in <b>their</b> <b>diet.</b> In late summer, however, grasses, forbs, and seeds make up most of <b>their</b> <b>diet.</b> They also like to feed on alfalfa and clover. They drink less water, as their plant diet mostly serves their water requirements.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors affect whether dieting will affect these menstrual processes: age, weight loss and the diet itself. First, younger women are likely to {{experience}} menstrual irregularities due to <b>their</b> <b>diet.</b> Second, menstrual abnormalities are more likely with more weight loss. For example, anovulatory cycles can occur {{as a result of}} adopting a restricted diet, as well as engaging in a high amount of exercise. Finally, the cycle is affected more by a vegetarian diet compared to a non-vegetarian diet.|$|E
5|$|Beetles {{are able}} to exploit a wide {{diversity}} of food sources available in their many habitats. Some are omnivores, eating both plants and animals. Other beetles are highly specialized in <b>their</b> <b>diet.</b> Many species of leaf beetles, longhorn beetles, and weevils are very host-specific, feeding on only a single species of plant. Ground beetles and rove beetles (Staphylinidae), among others, are primarily carnivorous and catch and consume many other arthropods and small prey, such as earthworms and snails. While most predatory beetles are generalists, a few species have more specific prey requirements or preferences.|$|E
50|$|<b>Their</b> <b>diets</b> consist {{primarily}} of aquatic invertebrates, including freshwater clams, crayfish, snails, and various insects. They also feed on fish and carrion.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{food source}} of this species is ripe and unripe fruit; it has the highest {{reliance}} on this food source of all species in this genus. A variety of species provide fruit year-round, but leaves supplement the sugars of the fruits with protein in <b>their</b> <b>diets.</b> When these food sources are limited, the howlers also supplement <b>their</b> <b>diets</b> with more mature leaves, flowers, woody plant matter, and sometimes fungi to possibly help digest the increased plant matter.|$|R
25|$|Some {{of these}} species (including humans) {{are able to make}} do with the lower levels {{available}} from <b>their</b> <b>diets</b> by recycling oxidised vitamin C.|$|R
