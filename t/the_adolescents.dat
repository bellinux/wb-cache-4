(Psychology) The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{influence}} that the parent-child relationship has over development of <b>the</b> <b>adolescent.</b> This isdone through the theoretical concept of individuation. The basic assumption of this study is that it is not only <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> that undergoes certain developmental changes during individuation, but that the relationship context wherein he finds himself, also changes. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> and his context influence one another mutually. Individuation does not just pose certain demands on <b>the</b> <b>adolescent,</b> but also on the parent-adolescent relationship as well as the family system. It is also evident that family functioning has an important influence over the type and quality of the parent-adolescent relationship. Therefore the dynamic interaction between family functioning, the characteristics of the parent-adolescent relationship, and the personality development of <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> is being examined according to developmental theories as well as the family system approach.

This means that private thoughts about the relationship as well as public recognition of the relationship were both important to <b>the</b> <b>adolescents</b> in the sample. Sexual events (such as sexual touching, sexual intercourse) were less common than romantic events (holding hands) and social events (being with one's partner in a group setting).

To tease apart these models, Funder and Block explored the association between ego control, ego resiliency, IQ and delayed gratification in adolescents. <b>The</b> <b>adolescents</b> had the choice between being paid $4 at each of six study sessions or delaying their payment until the last session, in which case they would also earn an addition $4 of [...] "interest". The results supported both models of delayed gratification. The teens' tendency to delay gratification was indeed associated with IQ and with ego resiliency (e.g., higher delayers were rated as more responsible, consistent, likable, sympathetic, generous; less hostile, moody, self-indulgent, rebellious), but was also independently associated with ego control (e.g., higher delayers were rated as [...] "tends toward over-control of needs and impulses" [...] and [...] "favors conservative values in a number of areas"). The researchers noted that individual differences in ego control (i.e., overall impulsivity) may play a larger role in delayed gratification when the incentives are larger and more motivating.|$|E

Goal: The aim of {{this study}} is to use the Gestalt {{approach}} to explore, and to make use of sandplay to describe and observe the world of <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> client, in order to lead the social worker to gain insight and understanding to the world of <b>the</b> <b>adolescent.</b> This study was done because the researcher observed that sandplay achieved very positive effects with children, adolescents and adults. This study was motivated by the desire to provide recommendations to the social workers in practice about the value and use of sandplay in the exploration of the world of <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> <b>The</b> literature study focussed on a) <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> life-phase in order to determine the specific developmental aspects and characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>adolescent,</b> b) to define the possibilities of sandplay as an exploration medium, as well as c) assessing the Gestalt approach as orientation theory and as practice theory with sandplay. In this research, a qualitative methodology was used combined with a case-study research design. Sandplay was used as a medium for exploration with three adolescent participants. They were selected by means of a non-probability sampling. The researcher used detailed, in-depth, data gathering methods which included six measuring instruments. These instruments included: a standardised questionnaire to give an indication of personality-traits of the participants; two questionnaires to determine the behaviour, thought patterns and domestic circumstances of the participants; semi-structured interview-schedules to explore the sandtrays of the participants; photographs to accurately capture and record the sandtrays; as well as observations recording the behaviour and non-verbal communication of the participants. The researcher concludes that, according to the Gestalt-approach, exploration with sandplay is an effective method to explore the world of <b>the</b> <b>adolescent.</b> This method provides adequate information to the social worker to understand the world of <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> client. Sandplay, according to the Gestalt approach, contributes value to social work practice, because it enhances the effectiveness of exploration and intervention. Sandplay provides the social worker with comprehensive information about <b>the</b> <b>adolescent,</b> and enables <b>the</b> social worker to identify the core problem of <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> expeditiously. Sandplay involves <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> in a sensory, cognitive and emotional manner, which contributes to more information being exposed that leads to more effective interventions. This method is also novel, interesting and challenging to the social worker and <b>the</b> <b>adolescent.</b> <b>The</b> researcher recommends sandplay for the exploration of the world of <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> be preceded by establishing a therapeutic relationship with <b>the</b> <b>adolescent.</b> Once a relationship is established a number of sandtrays can be built, and thoroughly explored. The first sandtray should be non-directive. Directive sandtrays are subsequently recommended to explore specific themes and to handle trauma and/or issues which <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> may experience. It is also recommended that the social worker utilizes hypotheses, which can be postulated from the symbolic meanings of miniatures, as well as interpretations from other sandplay research in his/her exploration of sandtrays. The social worker, who uses sandplay to explore the world of <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> according to <b>the</b> Gestalt approach, should be knowledgeable about sandplay, the symbolic meaning of miniatures, sandplay research and the Gestalt approach as orientation theory and practice theory.
