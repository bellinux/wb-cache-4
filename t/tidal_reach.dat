25|$|The {{abutments}} {{of modern}} London Bridge rest several metres above natural embankments of gravel, sand and clay. From the late Neolithic era the southern embankment formed a natural causeway above the surrounding swamp and marsh of the river's estuary; the northern ascended to higher {{ground at the}} present site of Cornhill. Between the embankments, the River Thames could have been crossed by ford when the tide was low, or ferry when it was high. Both embankments, particularly the northern, would have offered stable backheads for boat traffic up and downstream – the Thames and its estuary were a major inland and Continental trade route from at least the 9th century BC. There is archaeological evidence for scattered Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age settlement nearby, but until a bridge was built there, London did not exist. Two ancient fords were in use a few miles upstream, beyond the river's upper <b>tidal</b> <b>reach.</b> It seems that the course of Watling Street was aligned with them and led into the heartlands of the Catuvellauni, {{who at the time}} of Caesar's invasion of 54 BC were Britain's most powerful tribe. Some time before Claudius's conquest of AD 43, power shifted to the Trinovantes, who held the region northeast of the Thames Estuary from a capital at Camulodunum, nowadays Colchester in Essex. Claudius imposed a major colonia on Camulodunum, and made it the capital city of the new Roman province of Britannia. The first London Bridge was built by the Romans as part of their road-building programme, to help consolidate their conquest.|$|E

40|$|In the Schelde continuum, a {{succession}} in the phytoplankton community is observed along {{the transition from}} the river to the freshwater <b>tidal</b> <b>reaches</b> of the estuary and from the freshwater to brackish reaches of the estuary. The goal {{of this study was to}} experimentally evaluate the contribution of changes in salinity and light climate to this succession. In summer 2000 and in spring 2001, phytoplankton communities from the river, the freshwater <b>tidal</b> <b>reaches</b> and the brackish reaches of the estuary were incubated under high or low light intensities and exposed to a change in salinity. HPLC analysis was used to evaluate the response of different algal groups to changes in light intensity and salinity. When incubated at a light intensity corresponding to the mean underwater light intensity of the freshwater <b>tidal</b> <b>reaches,</b> growth of phytoplankton from the river as well as from freshwater <b>tidal</b> <b>reaches</b> was significantly lower than when incubated at a light intensity corresponding to the mean underwater light intensity of the river. The phytoplankton community from the freshwater <b>tidal</b> <b>reaches</b> did not appear to be better adapted to low light intensities than the phytoplankton community from the river. Although diatoms were expected to be less sensitive to a reduction in light intensity than green algae, the opposite response was observed. Freshwater and brackish water phytoplankton were negatively affected by respectively an increase or decrease in salinity. However, the effect of salinity was not strong enough to explain the disappearance of freshwater and brackish water phytoplankton between a salinity of 0. 5 and 10  psu, suggesting that other factors also play a role. In the freshwater phytoplankton communities from the river and the freshwater <b>tidal</b> <b>reaches,</b> green algae and diatoms responded in a similar way to an increase in salinity. In the brackish water phytoplankton community, fucoxanthin displayed a different response to salinity than lutein and chlorophyll a...|$|R

40|$|To {{unravel the}} factors that {{regulate}} DOC dynamics in the freshwater <b>tidal</b> <b>reaches</b> of the Schelde estuary, DOC concentration and biodegradability were monitored in the upper Schelde estuary and its major tributaries. Although the Schelde estuary possesses a densely populated and industrialized catchment, our {{data suggest that the}} bulk of DOC in the freshwater <b>tidal</b> <b>reaches</b> is not derived from waste water. This was concluded from the low biodegradability of DOC (on average 9 %), DOC concentrations that are close to the mean for European rivers (4. 61 mg 1 (- 1)) and the absence of an inverse relationship between DOC and discharge. Most DOC originating from waste water being discharged in tributaries of the estuary appears to be remineralised before these tributaries reach the main estuary. Although dense phytoplankton blooms were observed in the upper estuary during summer (up to 700 mu g chl a 1 (- 1)), these blooms did not appear to produce large quantities of DOC in the freshwater <b>tidal</b> <b>reaches</b> as DOC concentrations were low when phytoplankton biomass was high. The fact that DOC concentrations were high in winter and decreased in summer suggests a predominantly terrestrial source of DOC in the freshwater <b>tidal</b> <b>reaches</b> of the Schelde estuary.
