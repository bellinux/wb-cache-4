5|$|In {{mapping the}} {{distribution}} of Mari Lwyd appearances, Cawte noted that it was principally a custom associated with Glamorgan, with two-thirds of instances falling within that county. <b>The</b> <b>custom</b> stretched east into the industrial valleys of Monmouthshire, with the most easterly account coming from Monmouth itself; this account {{is also one of}} the earliest. A number of examples were also found in Carmarthenshire, with a single example found in both Brecknockshire and Ceredigion. There is a single record of <b>the</b> <b>custom</b> being performed in North Wales, in an example from Wrexham, which Cawte believed was the result of a Glamorgan man bringing <b>the</b> <b>custom</b> with him as he moved north. Previously, Peate had cautioned that the comparative absence of recorded examples from Mid and North Wales was not proof that the Mari Lwyd custom had never been present in those areas.|$|E
5|$|The Mari Lwyd custom was {{performed}} during wither festivities, specifically around {{the dates of}} Christmas and New Year. However, the precise date on which <b>the</b> <b>custom</b> {{was performed}} varied between villages, and {{in a number of}} cases <b>the</b> <b>custom</b> was carried out for several consecutive nights. There is a unique example provided by an account from Gower in which the head was kept buried throughout the year, only being dug up for use during the Christmas season.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Reserve for Government Buildings {{was divided}} into <b>the</b> <b>Customs</b> House Reserve and the Post and Telegraph Reserve. In 1905, the Commonwealth subdivided <b>the</b> <b>Customs</b> Reserve further, returning the portion which included the Quarters to the State. Also in 1905, palm trees were planted {{to the north and}} the east of <b>the</b> <b>Customs</b> House.In 1921, <b>the</b> Commonwealth Bank leased <b>the</b> <b>Customs</b> House for 10 years, moving <b>the</b> <b>Customs</b> Service back into the adjacent timber building. <b>The</b> <b>Customs</b> House has since been altered several times for multiple occupancy, housing various other government departments. The brick Bond Store, on the south-east corner of the site addressing Sydney Street, was constructed about 1935.|$|R

5|$|Beecham {{took the}} {{orchestra}} on a controversial tour of Germany in 1936.

There was disquiet {{among some of the}} players that their presence in Germany gave the Nazi regime a propaganda coup.|$|E

Shivaji's own son, Sambhaji, was at roughly the same time a prisoner of the Mughals.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 This paper {{adds to the}} {{literature}} that examines the costs {{and the benefits of}} <b>the</b> <b>Customs</b> Union between Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus by measuring the impact of <b>the</b> <b>Customs</b> Union foreign direct investment in Kazakhstan. To evaluate <b>the</b> <b>Customs</b> Union's impact on foreign investment in Kazakhstan I develop a difference in difference model using data from the World Bank's World Development Indicators. While most empirical research has shown that <b>the</b> <b>Customs</b> Union negatively impacted Kazakhstan, this paper shows how <b>the</b> <b>Customs</b> Union contributed to increased flows of foreign direct investment into Kazakhstan. This result contradicts many western views that Kazakhstan gained nothing from <b>the</b> <b>Customs</b> Union, although it does not provide an overall net economic impact assessment. Because <b>the</b> <b>Customs</b> Union was just the first step of a larger regional economic integration project, this paper presents Kazakhstan with four policy options relating to future integration...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Customs</b> Consolidation Act 1853 {{dispensed}} with the giving of bonds, and laid down various provisions for securing <b>the</b> payment of <b>customs</b> duties on goods warehoused.

5|$|The {{historian}} Ronald Hutton {{stated that}} the Mari Lwyd tradition appeared to have become defunct in the early 20th century. In {{the middle of that}} century it was revived in Llangynwyd. In 1967, Lois Blake published a letter in the journal English Dance and Song in which she noted that the Mari Lwyd appeared each Christmas Eve at the Barley Mow Inn at Graig Penllyn, near Cowbridge, where a man named John Williams had kept <b>the</b> <b>custom</b> alive for the past sixty years. Blake also explained that she believed that <b>the</b> <b>custom</b> was still performed at several villages in the Maesteg area of Glamorgan. During the 1970s, Hole commented that the tradition was still found in Glamorganshire and Carmathenshire.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{frequently}} accompanied {{his wife}} to church services.

He ceased attending at all on communion Sundays after being admonished by a rector.|$|E
5|$|A popular {{approach}} {{to improve performance}} {{is to create a}} memory pool-based allocator. Instead of allocating memory every time an item is inserted or removed from a container, a large block of memory (the memory pool) is allocated beforehand, possibly at the startup of the program. <b>The</b> <b>custom</b> allocator will serve individual allocation requests by simply returning a pointer to memory from the pool. Actual deallocation of memory can be deferred until the lifetime of the memory pool ends. An example of memory pool-based allocators {{can be found in the}} Boost C++ Libraries.|$|E
