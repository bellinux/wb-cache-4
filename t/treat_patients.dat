His grudging fulfillment of this duty, or his creative methods of avoiding it, constitute a recurring subplot, which often serves as the series' comic relief. During clinic duty, House confounds patients with unwelcome observations into their personal lives, eccentric prescriptions, and unorthodox treatments. However, after seeming to be inattentive to their complaints, he regularly impresses them with rapid and accurate diagnoses.

5|$|Thyroid hormones {{to treat}} goiters: In 239 BC, Master Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals stated that where water is too light, people suffer {{widespread}} baldness and goiter. It {{was not until}} the 1860 that French physician Gaspard Adolphe Chatin (1813–1901) linked goiter with the lack of iodine in soil and water; iodine was discovered in the thyroid gland in 1896 by German chemist Eugen Baumann, while thyroid extract was used to <b>treat</b> <b>patients</b> in 1890. The Tang Dynasty (618–907) physician Zhen Quan (d. 643 AD), in his Old and New Tried and Tested Prescriptions, stated that the thyroid glands taken from gelded rams were used to <b>treat</b> <b>patients</b> with goiter; the thyroid hormones could be swallowed in pill form (the body of the pill made from crushed jujube pulp) or as a solid thyroid gland with the fat taken off. The Pharmacopoeia of the Heavenly Husbandman asserted that iodine-rich sargassum was used to treat goiter by the 1st century BC (Ge Hong, 284–364, also suggested using a tincture derived from sargassum seaweed in about 340 AD), a treatment later recorded in the West by Italian practrica Roger of Palermo in his Practica Chirurgiae of 1180 AD.|$|E

5|$|Bishop's work {{evolved to}} include studies of drug {{resistance}} {{in both the}} parasites and the host organisms, the studies that would earn her {{a place in the}} Royal Society. Significant work from this period of Bishop's life included a study showing that the parasite itself did not develop resistance to quinine, but that host organisms could develop resistance to the drug proguanil. Her in vitro research was proven accurate when the drugs she studied were used to <b>treat</b> <b>patients</b> suffering from tertian malaria, a form of the illness in which the paroxysm of fever occurs every third day. She also investigated the drugs pamaquine and atebrin, along with proguanil, though proguanil was the only one shown to cause the development of drug resistance. Other studies showed that malaria parasites could develop cross-resistance to other antimalarial drugs. Bishop worked at Molteno until 1967. Her research and experimental protocols were later used in rodent and human studies, albeit with modifications.|$|E
5|$|Rovelizumab, trade-named LeukArrest {{and also}} known as Hu23F2G, was {{developed}} to <b>treat</b> <b>patients</b> suffering from hemorrhagic shock, which is caused by massive blood loss. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the recruitment of white blood cells {{to the site of}} inflammation. During testing, few patients were given the drug, because LeukArrest had to be administered within four hours of the injury and informed consent was required; patients were often unconscious, and relatives had to be reached to give consent. In June1998, Icos and many medical centers asked the FDA to waive consent requirements in situations where the patient was at high risk of dying and relatives could not be reached. While some medical ethicists opposed waiving consent, the FDA approved the proposal in August1998 for five medical centers. Development of LeukArrest was halted in April2000 when interim data from phaseIII clinical trials did not meet Icos's goals of significantly reducing the chance of multiple organ failure and reducing the death rate from shock at 28days. LeukArrest was also tested unsuccessfully for treatment of heart attack, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese of the Tang era {{were also}} very {{interested}} in the benefits of officially classifying all of the medicines used in pharmacology. In 657, Emperor Gaozong of Tang (r. 649–683) commissioned the literary project of publishing an official materia medica, complete with text and illustrated drawings for 833 different medicinal substances taken from different stones, minerals, metals, plants, herbs, animals, vegetables, fruits, and cereal crops. In addition to compiling pharmacopeias, the Tang fostered learning in medicine by upholding imperial medical colleges, state examinations for doctors, and publishing forensic manuals for physicians. Authors of medicine in the Tang include Zhen Chuan (d. 643) and Sun Simiao (581–682), the former who first identified in writing that patients with diabetes had an excess of sugar in their urine, and the latter who was the first to recognize that diabetic patients should avoid consuming alcohol and starchy foods. As written by Zhen Chuan and others in the Tang, the thyroid glands of sheep and pigs were successfully used to treat goiters; thyroid extracts were not used to <b>treat</b> <b>patients</b> with goiter in the West until 1890.

40|$|Background: The {{management}} of tibial plateau fractures {{continues to be}} a challenge for orthopedics surgeons. Restoration of articular congruity and early range of motion should be the primary goal of treatment. Proper and adequate preoperative planning is essential for a good outcome. Historically the treatment of these fractures has been plagued by complications despite of better understanding of soft tissues injury and advancement in different treatment modalities. Objectives: We evaluated the short-term outcome of patients with tibial plateau fractures treated at MOI 2012. Methodology: A hospital based cross sectional prospective study was done on adult patients with tibial plateau fractures treated at MOI. Seventy four patients met our study inclusion criteria but 5 patients were lost follow up, so we reviewed 69 patients who completed follow ups. A researcher used a structured questionnaire to interview the participants. These <b>patients</b> were <b>treated</b> by either conservative or surgical method. Immediately post operatively control radiographs were taken. Then each patient was followed up for a minimum of 16 weeks post treatment. In the follow up visits, status of the wound, flexion of the knee, ability to bear weight without pain, fracture healing and stability of the knee were assessed. The obtained data were analyzed by SPSS version 21. 	 Results: Male were affected more than females with male to female ratio 5. 9 : 1. Majority of patients were aged from 29 to 50 years with age range of 19 to 69 and mean age of 39. 5 years ± 10. 7 SD. Road traffic crash was {{the most common cause of}} injury, 79. 7 %. <b>Patients</b> who were <b>treated</b> conservatively were 42 % and those who were treated surgically were 58 %. Deep wound infection occurred in 12 % among <b>patients</b> who were <b>treated</b> surgically. One <b>patient</b> (16. 7 %) out of 6 patients with open fractures had infection while 4 patients (11. 8 %) out of 34 patients with closed fractures had infection. The overall knee flexion of less than 90 degrees was encountered in 37. 9 % among conservatively <b>treated</b> <b>patients</b> and 25 % among surgically <b>treated</b> <b>patients.</b> Severe limitation to weight bearing by pain was encountered in 6. 9 % of conservatively <b>treated</b> <b>patients</b> and in 5 % of surgically <b>treated</b> <b>patients.</b> By 16 th week 93. 1 % of conservatively <b>treated</b> <b>patients</b> had their fracture healed and 95 % of surgically <b>treated</b> <b>patients</b> had their fracture healed. Knee instability was encountered in 3. 4 % in conservatively <b>treated</b> <b>patients</b> and in 5 % in surgically <b>treated</b> <b>patients.</b> Time from treatment to full weight bearing between 6 and 12 weeks were encountered in 55. 2 % of conservatively <b>treated</b> <b>patients</b> and in 32. 5 % of surgically <b>treated</b> <b>patients.</b> Patients who started full weight bearing after 12 weeks were 44. 8 % in conservatively <b>treated</b> <b>patients</b> and in 67. 5 % in surgically <b>treated</b> <b>patients.</b> Conclusion: Both conservative and surgical methods of treatment are effective in the treatment of tibial plateau fractures depending on the type and severity of the fracture. In this study, good results in terms of knee joint flexion, stability, fracture union and ability to bear weight without pain were seen in both conservatively and surgically <b>treated</b> <b>patients.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Acute fulminant {{pancreatitis}} {{is associated}} with significant morbidity and mortality. To examine the outcome of conservative and surgical treatment of this disorder, 36 patients who survived an initial episode were restudied after a mean of six years. Fifty three per cent had developed diabetes mellitus, half of whom required insulin therapy. Pancreatic resection {{was associated with a}} 100 % frequency of diabetes, while only 26 % of those treated with peritoneal lavage developed this (p less than 0. 001). Insulin secretion and sensitivity were assessed using the hyperglycaemic glucose clamp technique. First phase insulin secretion was impaired in surgically <b>treated</b> <b>patients</b> (mean (SEM) 14 (5) microU/ml x 10 minutes) compared with conservatively <b>treated</b> <b>patients</b> and control subjects (144 (66) and 87 (12) microU/ml x 10 minutes, respectively; p less than 0. 05). Second phase and 'maximal' insulin secretion were also impaired among the surgically <b>treated</b> <b>patients</b> compared with the conservatively <b>treated</b> <b>patients</b> and the controls. Insulin sensitivity was reduced among the surgically <b>treated</b> <b>patients</b> (2. 88 (58) mg/kg. minute) when compared with conservatively <b>treated</b> <b>patients</b> and healthy control subjects (5. 87 (1. 02) and 6. 45 (0. 66) mg/kg. minute; p less than 0. 05).

40|$|Whether Achilles tendon rupture {{benefits}} from surgery or conservative treatment remains controversial. Moreover, the outcome can {{be influenced by}} the rehabilitation protocol. The goal of the present meta-analysis was to compare the rerupture rate after surgical repair of the Achilles tendon followed by weightbearing within 4 weeks versus conservative treatment with weightbearing within 4 weeks. In addition, a secondary analysis was performed to compare the rerupture rates in patients who started weightbearing after 4 weeks. Seven randomized controlled trials published from 2001 to 2012, with 576 adult patients, were included. The primary outcome measure was the rerupture rate. The secondary outcomes were minor and major complications other than rerupture. In the early weightbearing group, 7 of 182 operatively <b>treated</b> <b>patients</b> (4 %) experienced rerupture versus 21 of 176 of the conservatively <b>treated</b> <b>patients</b> (12 %). A secondary analysis of the <b>patients</b> <b>treated</b> with late weightbearing showed a rerupture rate of 6 % (7 of 108) for operatively <b>treated</b> <b>patients</b> versus 10 % (11 of 110) for conservatively <b>treated</b> <b>patients.</b> The differences concerning the rerupture rate in both groups were not statistically significant.
