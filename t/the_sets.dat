5|$|Despite Warner Bros.' new prosperity, Jack kept a tight rein on costs. He {{placed the}} studio's {{directors}} on a quota system, and decreed a flat, low-key lighting style to make <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> look cheaper than they were.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} known ways {{to build a}} set of point on an Edwards curve: <b>the</b> <b>set</b> of affine points, <b>the</b> <b>set</b> of {{projective}} points, <b>the</b> <b>set</b> of inverted points, <b>the</b> <b>set</b> of extended points and <b>the</b> <b>set</b> of completed points.|$|R

5|$|Filming was {{to begin}} on 21 May 2011: {{a week after the}} release of Kapoor's Ragini MMS. But due to {{production}} delays, it began a week later. Balan, a religious person, organised a puja on <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> before principal photography began.|$|E
5|$|A binder {{with the}} film's storyboards {{served as a}} {{reference}} for live-action filming, shots that would be filmed {{in front of a}} chroma key blue screen, and shots that would be composed using CGI. <b>The</b> <b>sets</b> were often built with the parts that would be required on screen; often they were built only up to the heights of the actors. Chroma key was extensively used for digital set extensions, backgrounds or scenes that required cinematographer David Tattersall to seek powerful lamps to light <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> and visual effects supervisor John Knoll to develop software that would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. Knoll, who remained on set through most of the production, worked closely with Tatterstall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with data capture models to provide technical data for the CGI artists.|$|E
5|$|A matroid is a {{mathematical}} structure in which certain sets of elements are defined to be independent, {{in such a}} way that the independent sets satisfy properties modeled after the properties of linear independence in a vector space. One of the standard examples of a matroid is the graphic matroid in which the independent sets are <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> of edges in forests of a graph; the matroid structure of forests is important in algorithms for computing the minimum spanning tree of the graph. Analogously, we may define matroids from pseudoforests.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>set</b> {{of numbers}} { − 2−n − 2−m−n | 0 ≤ m,n < ω } has order type ω². <b>The</b> {{previous}} <b>set</b> is <b>the</b> <b>set</b> of limit points within <b>the</b> <b>set.</b> Within <b>the</b> <b>set</b> of real numbers, either with the ordinary topology or the order topology, 0 {{is also a}} limit point of <b>the</b> <b>set.</b> It is also a limit point of <b>the</b> <b>set</b> of limit points.|$|R

5|$|Affleck had an eleven-year {{relationship}} with actress Jennifer Garner from 2004 to 2015. They began dating in mid-2004, having established a friendship on <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> of Pearl Harbor (2001) and Daredevil (2003). They were married on June 29, 2005, {{in a private}} Turks and Caicos ceremony. Victor Garber, who officiated the ceremony, and his partner, Rainer Andreesen, were the only guests. They announced their intention to divorce in June 2015, and filed legal documents in April 2017.|$|E
5|$|Although cinematographer Clyde DaVinna is {{credited}} with the cinematography, additional footage was shot by George Gordon Nogle, Josiah Roberts, and Leonard Smith. Screenwriter John Lee Mahin claims he shot {{a few of the}} scenes with Eskimo women when coverage was found to be lacking. Numerous days of shooting were lost in the summer when strong sunlight made it impossible to film. To reduce glare from the snow, most of <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> were sprayed with pink paint from the air.|$|E
5|$|Another of the Joyeuse magnificences was the Ballet Comique de la Reine, devised and {{presented}} by Queen Louise, who directed her own team of writers and musicians.

50|$|In other words, <b>the</b> power <b>set</b> of <b>the</b> empty <b>set</b> is <b>the</b> <b>set</b> {{containing}} <b>the</b> empty <b>set</b> and <b>the</b> power <b>set</b> of {{any other}} <b>set</b> is all <b>the</b> subsets of <b>the</b> <b>set</b> containing some specific element and all the subsets of <b>the</b> <b>set</b> not containing that specific element.|$|R
5|$|As 27 of the 31 Inter-Capital {{sets are}} {{sufficient}} {{to operate the}} service, four are currently used by SNCF for domestic TGV services; one of these regularly operates a Paris–Lille shuttle.

SNCF's lease of <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> is scheduled to last until 2011, with an option for a further two years.|$|E
5|$|At {{the taping}} of the episode, {{the cast and}} crew passed around yearbooks, {{custom-made}} by the production staff, and signed them for each other. The cast gave the producers inscribed Cartier SA watches, while the producers gave the cast Neil Lane jewelry. As <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> were broken down, {{the cast and crew}} each got a chunk of the street outside Central Perk in a glass box as a keepsake.|$|E
5|$|Both Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were {{equipped}} with {{two sets of}} Seetakt radar. One was mounted on the forward gun director, which was located {{on top of the}} bridge. The second radar set was emplaced on the rear main battery gun director. The Seetakt sets operated at 368megacycles, initially at 14kW, though <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> were upgraded to operate at 100kW, on the 80cm wavelength.|$|E

5|$|By {{this point}} the Air Ministry was desperate to get any unit into service. Satisfied with his visit in May, Dowding {{suggested}} that the Mk. I {{was good enough for}} operational testing purposes. On 11 June 1939, AI was given the highest priority and provisions were made to supply 11 additional Blenheims to No 25 squadron at RAF Hawkinge (for a total of 21). Since each of the parts came from different suppliers, and the fitters were unfamiliar with any of it, members of the AI team would have to hand-assemble the components as they arrived and instruct the fitters on <b>the</b> <b>sets.</b>|$|E
5|$|Drishyam {{commenced}} principal {{photography in}} the first week of October 2013. Mohanlal joined <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> only from 10 October as he was down with chickenpox. The film was shot at Thodupuzha in Kerala. The road-side house shown in the film, which was a major location, is situated at Vazhithala, near Thodupuzha. The shooting had to be halted for a while as Meena fainted on the location. Drishyam was initially planned to be filmed in 52 days, though it was completed in 44 days.|$|E
5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{visited the}} set {{frequently}} during filming. Members {{of the main}} cast approached Stillwell with questions {{about the nature of}} the altered universe, trying to determine if they were still playing the same characters. Goldberg asked Ganino about changing a piece of dialogue on set, but since Ganino was not the author of the teleplay, he deferred to Stillwell, who in turn notified the production office. When Berman found out that Ganino and Stillwell were on set and talking to the actors, he banned them from setting foot on <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> again.|$|E

5|$|Harvie Krumpet {{was filmed}} in Melbourne over 15 months between October 2001 and January 2003. The film {{was shot in}} {{sequence}} in three-month blocks, interspersed with three-month blocks of building sets and models. Production began in Elliott's garage and subsequently took place in three separate studios, moving three times {{in order to accommodate}} the growing size of <b>the</b> <b>sets.</b> It was shot on Super 16 mm film using a Bolex camera. Each individual frame was animated, meaning that an average of 3–5 seconds' worth of film was produced in each full day of filming.|$|E
5|$|In {{their book}} The Fantastic 1804 Dollar, numismatic historians Eric P. Newman and Kenneth E. Bressett assert {{that a problem}} arose at the Mint {{as to how to}} {{interpret}} Forsyth's order. As his initial correspondence indicated that <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> were to include coins of every type then in use, Mint officials included both the silver dollar and gold eagle. The moratorium on silver dollar coinage had been lifted in 1831, but none had been coined since those issued in March 1804. Two sets of coins, minted in proof finish, were completed and delivered along with their boxes to Roberts shortly prior to his departure on the USS Peacock on April 27, 1835. The dollars included <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> bore the Draped Bust design, depicting an allegorical representation of Liberty on the obverse and a heraldic eagle on the reverse. A list of diplomatic gifts was also proposed for missions to Japan and Cochin-China (today part of Vietnam), which included two additional sets of coins.|$|E
