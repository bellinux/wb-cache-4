2500|$|At {{around one}} o'clock one morning I {{returned}} to the Windsor Hotel in Melbourne to the staggering sight of Ken Barrington sitting alone in the lounge drinking whisky. The Test match was critically poised and Barrington, invariably an early-to-bed man in a crisis, was a portrait of gloom. He was batting {{first thing in the}} morning and couldn't sleep. He returned to bed, tossed and turned for another hour until, in desperation, he committed the capital offence of telephoning the manager's room. The Duke, a chronic insomaniac had a supply of sleeping pills so powerful that the average recipient would remain oblivious to nuclear attack. In the name of England, Barrington was determined to get his hands on them. [...] "Damn you, Barrington" [...] roared the Duke, [...] "I had only just got to sleep myself." [...] Then, relenting, he said [...] "All right, come and get them". In the same moment that Barrington's hand replaced the receiver his head hit the pillow and he fell into exhausted unconsciousness. The Duke waited and waited. He was still awake when dawn exploded into dazzling sunshine and it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Brooks {{returned}} to EastEnders for a guest stint. She was later confirmed {{to be coming}} back as a regular character. She said, [...] "I had doubts to begin with, mainly because of Kiki, as I know how full-on EastEnders can be, and then there's that stigma {{about going back to}} a soap. But I'm so pleased I did, it was the right decision. Especially with what's going on at the moment, I feel really lucky to have a job and I need the security because of Kiki. I was just going to go back for a year, but I had a meeting with the boss last week and we're going to go for another year. So lots more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> to much mischief". Executive producer Diederick Santer said, [...] "I couldn't be more pleased that Charlie Brooks is re-joining EastEnders. With her appearances last month, she reminded us what a fine actress she is, and what an intriguing, watchable and engaging character she plays as Janine". She temporarily departed in September 2012, and returned in April 2013 before departing again in March 2014.|$|E

25|$|Even when {{vacation}} time is offered in some U.S. companies, some {{choose not to}} take advantage of it. A 2003 survey by Management Recruiter International stated that fifty percent of executives surveyed didn’t have plans to take a vacation. They decided to stay at work and use their vacation <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> caught <b>up</b> on their increased workloads.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must give}} us <b>time,</b> dad, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> our roses," [...] Frances Hudson said, in reply to her father's remarks {{as to their}} appearance. [...] "I have no doubt a few days at sea will do it; but of course, it is only right and proper that young ladies should be pale, after going through such an {{adventure}} as we had yesterday.|$|R

6000|$|... "Never mind, Sara," [...] comforted Cecily. [...] "It's {{not to be}} till {{two o'clock}} to-morrow, so you'll have plenty of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> here before {{anything}} happens." ...|$|E
60|$|The cry {{came from}} Abe Blower, {{as he turned}} and sat up. It was growing light {{in the east and}} the old miner thought it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh--er--who is that?" [...] {{they heard}} Job Haskers murmur. [...] "Is it <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up,</b> Swingly?" [...] He {{mentioned}} {{the name of}} the school janitor, who had orders to rouse him when he was over-sleeping.|$|E
6000|$|... "Get {{busy with}} the axe and you'll forget it," [...] advised Pat, adding, [...] "It is the {{courtesy}} of the woods to leave a little wood {{ready for the next}} fellow who may hit camp late, as we did yesterday. You'll have just about <b>time</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>get</b> warmed <b>up</b> before these flapjacks are ready." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. After {{preliminary}} design of low floor front axle is finished, {{finite element analysis}} module of CATIA {{is used to calculate}} the distribution of stress field and displacement field of low floor front axle in the working conditions of vertical static loading, emergency braking as well as side slipping of bus, and then the conclusion will be reached to provide theory basis for front axle design of the whole project. Preface Most of city buses are two or three steps, the height of its floor is 600 mm～ 700 mm, for this kinds of buses, the common front axle can meet the challenge. With the development of urban transportation and the growth in the living standard, two or three steps buses have inconvenient problem for particular group and waste <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and down the bus. A city needs one step buses {{to meet the needs of}} all kinds of people. To achieve this requirement, the bus floor height should be lower. The bus floor height is about 360 mm～ 400 mm. To lower floor height means the space under the axle is to be decreased, as shown in fig. 1. To resolve this problem, the key is to design large fall low floor front axle and full-scale finite element analysis of the front axle. The paper analyzes the load conditions of vertical static of low floor front axle, emergenc...|$|R
2500|$|The third march {{received}} {{national and}} international coverage; it publicized the marchers' message without harassment by police and segregation supporters. [...] Gaining more widespread support from other civil rights organizations in the area, this march was considered an overall success, with greater influence on the public. Voter registration drives were organized in black-majority areas across the South, but it took <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> people signed <b>up.</b>|$|R

60|$|It was {{dear old}} Fred, my old pal Fred, the best old boy that ever stepped. I {{recognized}} {{his voice in}} a second, and I was scratching at the door before {{the old man had}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> out of his chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I {{shall have to}} start soon after lunch," [...] he said. [...] "It will take some <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> to town. I am not a very {{experienced}} driver, and my car is a little inclined to skid on wet roads." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{his current}} incarnation, Blue Devil still {{possesses}} {{some degree of}} superhuman strength, capable of going toe-to-toe with beings like Eclipso, and knocking out a power-drunk Enchantress in one punch. He is also remarkably resistant to physical damage, evidenced when Eclipso threw him a distance of approximately 500 feet upwards, {{he did not even}} require <b>time</b> <b>to</b> recover before <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> and heading back into the fight.|$|R
50|$|On the Apollo, {{the crew}} soon finds and kills the telepath who has {{merged with the}} computer. However, it takes some <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the ship <b>up</b> and running again. Eventually the crew regains control of their ship and departs for Earth. Lefcourt soon learns that Clark has {{committed}} suicide before he could be arrested, and that Clark has turned the defense platforms towards Earth, which could destroy most of the planet's surface.|$|R

6000|$|... "The wind is {{dropping}} fast, {{and the sea}} hadn't <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up.</b> We had some trouble at first when the awning blew out of its lashings and stopped her coming round, but she steered all right {{as soon as we}} got her before the sea." ...|$|E

"A {{month or}} two after I was gazetted I went out to India with the regiment, and arrived just in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> by forced marches {{to take part in}} the battle of Chillianwalla. The {{consequence}} was that up to that time I literally had heard no musketry practice.|$|E
60|$|Here a French Zouave, {{shot through}} the legs, was sitting up, {{supporting}} on his breast {{the head of his}} dying officer. A little way off, a private of the 88th, whose arm had been carried away, besought the searchers to fill and light his pipe for him, and to take the musket out of the hand of a wounded Russian near, who, he said, had three <b>times</b> tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it <b>up</b> <b>to</b> fire at him as he lay.|$|R
40|$|I {{begin with}} the stories and the {{children}}. I tell the stories because that’s how my mind works, and I {{begin with the}} children because in the end, it’s about them. I see in my mind a sweet and cooperative second grader years ago who, from <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time,</b> would <b>get</b> <b>up</b> {{out of his chair}} and spin around until he sat on the floor giggling. Since he otherwise never caused any problems, I would laugh too and ask in amazement, “Why do you feel you need to do this? ” Of course he didn’t know, and, at the time, neither did I. I remember the child with a variation on the first, years later and in another grade. He liked to drop out of his desk {{at the end of the}} day, flop onto his back on the rug and grin at the ceiling. I see the children who liked to work standing next to their desks and those who sat in them and never moved. I remember th...|$|R
50|$|The missile is {{launched}} {{from a simple}} metal box, which is connected to an operator station. An individual operator station can control up to 10 launcher boxes. The operator manually steers the missile {{by means of a}} small joystick. These course corrections are transmitted to the missile via a thin set of wires that trail behind the missile - see MCLOS. Like many early ATGMs, the missile had a large minimum range (see AT-3 Sagger) due <b>to</b> the <b>time</b> it took <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> flight speed and come under operator control.|$|R
6000|$|Rainiharo {{shook his}} head. [...] "Impossible. There {{is to be}} a great bull-fight this week, and you know Ranavalona will allow nothing to {{interfere}} with that. Besides, it takes <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> such an expedition as you suggest. However, I like the notion well. Go. I will think over it and see you again." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{cautiously}} and {{in silence}} the troops moved forward until {{a bend in}} the road disclosed a hill where the Spaniards were located. The guns were again brought to the front and placed in position, while the men crouched down in the road, waiting impatiently to give Roosevelt’s men, who were toiling over the little trail along the crest of the hill, <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{meant to}} have {{rushed to the}} room she shared with Valetta before it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up,</b> but Lots found the black head and the brown {{together}} on Dolores's pillow, wrapped in slumber; and though Mysie flew {{home as soon as}} she was well awake, Mrs. Halfpenny descended on her while she was yet in her bath, and inflicted a sharp scolding for the malpractice of getting into her cousin's bed.|$|E
60|$|When Caleb awoke it {{was almost}} evening. The rays {{of the setting sun}} were shining in at the window. Caleb opened his eyes, and, after lying still a few moments, began to sing. He thought it was morning, and that it was <b>time</b> for him <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up.</b> Presently, however, he {{observed}} that the sun was shining in at the wrong window for morning: then he noticed that he was not undressed; and, finally, he thought it must be night; but he could not think how he came to be asleep there at that time.|$|R
5000|$|As the {{altitude}} changes during the uphill {{part of the}} 4.4 mile hike, it is advised to bring an additional layer of clothing, as it is colder at the summit. The average <b>time</b> it takes <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and down the mountain is from 4 to 4.5 hours, so {{it is important to}} bring plenty of fluids and snacks. The trail offers picnic tables and resting spots throughout. The McAfee Knob trail is most popular in the spring and fall seasons, and there has been an average of around 100 hikers on the trail at once.|$|R
6000|$|In London, then, for a {{considerable}} <b>time,</b> I used <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> at eight o'clock in the morning, and pass an hour alone with Mr. Wilkinson, of the Theatres Royal, in Golden Square;--an hour alone. It was [...] "one, two, three; one, two, three--now jump--right foot more out, Mr. Smith; and if you COULD try and look a little more cheerful; your partner, sir, would like you hall the better." [...] Wilkinson called me Smith, for the fact is, I did not tell him my real name, nor (thank heaven!) does he know it to this day.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is a very}} {{unpleasant}} position, sir," [...] said he, when I {{reached the}} tree. [...] "I simply came into your yard, on a matter of business, and finding that raging beast attacking {{a person in a}} tree, I had barely <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> into this tree myself, before he dashed at me. Luckily I was out of his reach; but I very much fear I have lost some of my property." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the train}} {{the next day}} this {{struck me as a}} good deal for him to have consented to; but my purpose was firm enough to carry me on. I mounted the long hill to where the view begins, and then I knocked at her door. I was a trifle mystified by the fact that her blinds were still drawn, {{reflecting}} that if in the stress of my compunction I had come early I had certainly yet allowed people <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
60|$|Bella walked thoughtfully in {{the garden}} {{for an hour and}} more, and then, {{returning}} to the bedroom where Lavvy the Irrepressible still slumbered, put on a little bonnet of quiet, but on the whole of sly appearance, which she had yesterday made. 'I am going for a walk, Lavvy,' she said, as she stooped down and kissed her. The Irrepressible, with a bounce in the bed, and a remark that it wasn't <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> yet, relapsed into unconsciousness, if she had come out of it.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} use this system, the sound mixer used an {{intercom}} to the sound recordist {{to tell him to}} [...] "roll", or start the system. Since this was a very mechanical system, it took some <b>time</b> <b>to</b> start and <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> proper speed. When proper speed and synchronization was reached, the recordist would use the intercom to announce, [...] "Speed" [...] and the sound mixer would relay that to the director and crew on the stage. The expression is still used, but now simply means, [...] "Sound is recording".|$|R
5000|$|In Tom and Jerry's {{penthouse}} apartment room around 11:00 PM, Tom finishes {{reading a}} book and prepares to sleep, setting his alarm clock to ring in the morning. Unfortunately for Tom, this is also <b>time</b> for Jerry <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up.</b> The mouse's alarm-watch rings and Jerry showers (using a wrench on a pipe) and grooms himself before setting out for a tiny elevator in the wall. He hears Tom snoring and stops briefly (with a close-up of Tom's feet) before he enters the elevator and descends to a nightclub with {{a sign that says}} [...] "Le Cellar Smoqué" [...] ("The Smoky Cellar" [...] in French) displayed at its entrance.|$|R
60|$|He died a nobody, and {{was buried}} at Cluny, A.D., 1144. They removed {{his body to}} the Paraclete afterward, and when Heloise died, twenty years later, they buried her with him, in {{accordance}} with her last wish. He died at the ripe age of 64, and she at 63. After the bodies had remained entombed three hundred years, they were removed once more. They were removed again in 1800, and finally, seventeen years afterward, they were taken up and transferred to Pere la Chaise, where they will remain in peace and quiet until it comes <b>time</b> for them <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and move again.|$|R
