5|$|Following Rhoda, Kavner had a guest {{appearance}} on Taxi and {{appeared in the}} 1985 comedy Bad Medicine {{as well as the}} 1987 film Surrender, both of which were box office failures. She appeared in the television movies Revenge of the Stepford Wives, No Other Love and A Fine Romance, and shot a television pilot. She also starred in several stage plays, including a play called It Had to be You at a dinner theater in Canada, Particular Friendships in New York City in 1981, and Two for the Seesaw, directed by Burt Reynolds. Woody Allen first saw Kavner one night while he was watching Rhoda in the 1970s. He <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> remarkable and later offered her a role in his 1986 film Hannah and Her Sisters. Kavner agreed, and credits Allen and the film with rejuvenating her career.|$|E

25|$|In 1874, Blackwell {{established}} a women's {{medical school in}} London with Sophia Jex-Blake, {{who had been a}} student at the New York Infirmary years earlier. Blackwell had doubts about Jex-Blake, and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> dangerous, belligerent and tactless. Nonetheless, Blackwell became deeply involved with the school, and it opened in 1874 as the London School of Medicine for Women, with the primary goal of preparing women for the licensing exam of Apothecaries Hall. Blackwell vehemently opposed the use of vivisections in the laboratory of the school.|$|E

She applied to Vassar College at the age of 16, but the school <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> too young. In 1889, she attended New York Hospital's School of Nursing.

25|$|The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{records that}} King Æthelstan married his sister to Sihtric Cáech (died 927), king of Northumbria, {{and that the}} nuptials were celebrated at the Mercian royal centre at Tamworth on 30 January 926. William notes that she was Ecgwynn's daughter, {{but was unable to}} {{discover}} her name in any of the sources available to him. It is only later sources which offer suggestions, whose value remains uncertain. Roger of Wendover (died 1236) and Matthew Paris (died 1259) <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the St Edith (Eadgyth) who according to the Old English saints' list known as Secgan, was buried at the nunnery of Polesworth (Warwickshire), not far from Tamworth. Another late source drawing upon earlier material, the early 13th-century Chronicle of John of Wallingford, names Sihtric's wife Orgiue, possibly for Eadgifu or Eadgyth, and claims that their son was Olaf king of Northumbria, i.e. Amlaíb Cuarán. These data have garnered a mixed response from modern historians. Some scholars favour Roger's identification or at least the possibility that her name was Eadgyth, while Barbara Yorke argues that the name Eadgyth is unlikely to belong to two of Edward's daughters, the other being a daughter by Ælfflæd, and prefers to identify Edith of Polesworth with an earlier namesake.|$|E

500|$|Winslet {{was paid}} £6 million {{to star in}} her next release of the year, the drama Finding Neverland. It is about the {{relationship}} between the writer J. M. Barrie (played by Johnny Depp) and the Llewelyn Davies boys, which inspired him to create Peter Pan; Winslet played the boys' mother, Sylvia. Despite her reluctance to star in another period piece, Winslet agreed to the project after connecting with Sylvia's love for her children. Ella Taylor of LA Weekly found Winslet to be [...] "radiant and earthy as ever" [...] and CNN's Paul Clinton <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "exceptional in a delicate and finely tuned performance". She received a second Best Actress nomination at that year's BAFTA Award ceremony. With a box office gross of US$116 million, Finding Neverland became her most widely seen film since Titanic.|$|E
500|$|Two of Johansson's {{films in}} 2006 {{explored}} {{the world of}} stage magicians, both opposite Hugh Jackman. Allen cast her opposite Jackman and himself in the film Scoop (2006), in which she played a journalism student. The film was a modest worldwide box office success, but polarized critics. Ebert was critical of the film, but found Johansson [...] "lovely as always", and Mick LaSalle opined that she [...] "brings deftness and freshness" [...] to her part. She also appeared in Brian De Palma's The Black Dahlia, a film noir shot in Los Angeles and Bulgaria. Johansson later {{said she was a}} fan of DePalma and had wanted to work with him on the film. Nonetheless, she <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "physically wrong" [...] for the part, and Anne Billson of The Daily Telegraph likewise found her miscast.

500|$|In 1836, {{at a party}} {{hosted by}} Marie d'Agoult, Chopin met the French author George Sand (born [...] Aurore [...] Dupin). Short (under five feet, or 152cm), dark, big-eyed and a cigar smoker, she {{initially}} repelled Chopin, who remarked, [...] "What an unattractive person la Sand is. Is she really a woman?" [...] However, by early 1837 Maria Wodzińska's mother had {{made it clear to}} Chopin in correspondence that a marriage with her daughter was unlikely to proceed. It is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> influenced by his poor health and possibly also by rumours about his associations with women such as d'Agoult and Sand. Chopin finally placed the letters from Maria and her mother in a package on which he wrote, in Polish, [...] "My tragedy". Sand, in a letter to Grzymała of June 1838, admitted strong feelings for the composer and debated whether to abandon a current affair in order to begin a relationship with Chopin; she asked Grzymała to assess Chopin's relationship with Maria Wodzińska, without realising that the affair, at least from Maria's side, was over.|$|E
500|$|Series 5 has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. Matt Wales of IGN gave the entire series a [...] "great" [...] rating of 8.5 out of 10, {{saying that it}} [...] "mightn't have been perfect" [...] but rebooted the show [...] "with a burst of creative energy" [...] and [...] "got bold, exciting, witty, smart, home-grown event television back on the small screen". He praised Smith for [...] " [...] with a performance that painted the Doctor as thoroughly alien" [...] and the [...] "effortless" [...] character development of the Doctor, but was more critical {{of the character of}} Amy Pond. He <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "thoroughly watchable" [...] with Gillan's acting abilities and chemistry with Smith, but criticised the character for being [...] "frequently painted in largely two-dimensional strokes that made for a brash, sometimes irritating turn" [...] and the series as a whole for lacking [...] "heart to ground the elaborate sci-fi trimmings". Of the story, he praised Moffat's [...] "beautifully conceived" [...] story arc and the complexities of the narrative.|$|E

Leigh travelled to Los Angeles, however, to be with Olivier {{and to try to}} convince David Selznick that she was the person for the part. Myron Selznick also represented Olivier and when he met Leigh, he felt that she possessed the qualities that his brother was searching for. According to legend, Myron Selznick took Leigh and Olivier to the set where the burning of the Atlanta Depot scene was being filmed and stage-managed an encounter, where he introduced Leigh, derisively addressing his younger brother, [...] "Hey, genius, meet your Scarlett O'Hara." [...] The following day, Leigh read a scene for Selznick, who organized a screen test with director George Cukor and wrote to his wife, [...] "She's the Scarlett dark horse and looks damn good. Not for anyone's ear but your own: it's narrowed down to Paulette Goddard, Jean Arthur, Joan Bennett and Vivien Leigh". The director, George Cukor, concurred and praised Leigh's [...] "incredible wildness". She secured the role of Scarlett soon after.|$|E

In her final release of 2015, Padukone reunited with Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Ranveer Singh in Bajirao Mastani, a historical drama about a tragic extramarital affair. Singh was cast as the maratha general Bajirao I, while Priyanka Chopra and Padukone featured as his first and second wife, respectively. In preparation for the role of the warrior-princess Mastani, Padukone learnt sword-fighting, horse-riding and kalaripayattu. [...] With a revenue of over , Bajirao Mastani proved to be the fourth highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year. Anupama Chopra found Padukone [...] "riveting" [...] in the film, but Subhash K. Jha while praising her [...] "grace and dignity" [...] <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "way too subtle and silken, and not steely enough as [...] firebrand warrior-princess". The film was showcased at the International Film Festival of India; at the 61st Filmfare Awards, Bajirao Mastani was named Best Film and Padukone received her second Best Actress nomination in that year.|$|E
500|$|Alan Simpson, the co-writer of Hancock, enjoyed {{writing for}} Jacques, and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "almost like a fella {{in terms of}} playing comedy; you didn't write for her {{thinking}} she's a woman so we've got to write the feminine point of view. That {{made it easier for}} us". Neville Phillips thought she was a [...] "complete revelation", adding [...] "although she was a large lady (very large, in fact), her movements were dainty, light and graceful, and she had a way of playing comedy that put me in mind of the great Beatrice Lillie... a subtle, sophisticated actress". Her friend Bob Monkhouse thought that her career was overshadowed by her size: [...] "She was such a great comedienne... everyone wanted her but the movers and shakers of entertainment didn't perceive her as anything other than a fat lady". Guy Pearce, writing in the Daily Express, noted that [...] "she always chose to play women in funny situations, rather than refer directly to her weight. She concentrated on the script and its interpretation instead of winning easy laughs by playing 'the fattie'." [...] The approach of writers differed in how they dealt with the characters they asked Jacques to portray. Morwenna Banks and Amanda Swift consider Jacques to have been [...] "unimaginatively cast as the 'fat person'" [...] in ITMA, while in Sykes, her weight was rarely referred to—and Jacques said that Sykes [...] "hardly ever made jokes about my size which was a refreshing change". Gray considers that [...] "although often cast in broad comedy, she never played it broadly, but with an elegance of voice and body that belied all the clichés about women and weight".|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} speculated Thutmose's father was Amenhotep I. His mother, Senseneb, was of non-royal {{parentage}} {{and may have been}} a lesser wife or concubine. Queen Ahmose, who held the title of Great Royal Wife of Thutmose, was probably the daughter of Ahmose I and the sister of Amenhotep I; however, she was never called [...] "king's daughter," [...] so there is some doubt about this, and some historians believe that she was Thutmose's own sister. Assuming she was related to Amenhotep, it could be <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> married to Thutmose in order to guarantee succession. [...] However, this is known not to be the case for two reasons. Firstly, Amenhotep's alabaster bark built at Karnak associates Amenhotep's name with Thutmose's name well before Amenhotep's death. Secondly, Thutmose's first-born son with Ahmose, Amenmose, was apparently born long before Thutmose's coronation. He can be seen on a stela from Thutmose's fourth regnal year hunting near Memphis, and he became the [...] "great army-commander of his father" [...] sometime before his death, which was no later than Thutmose's own death in his 12th regnal year. Thutmose had another son, Wadjmose, and two daughters, Hatshepsut and Nefrubity, by Ahmose. Wadjmose died before his father, and Nefrubity died as an infant. Thutmose had one son by another wife, Mutnofret. This son succeeded him as Thutmose II, whom Thutmose I married to his daughter, Hatshepsut. It was later recorded by Hatshepsut that Thutmose willed the kingship to both Thutmose II and Hatshepsut. However, this is considered to be propaganda by Hatshepsut's supporters to legitimise her claim to the throne when she later assumed power.|$|E
