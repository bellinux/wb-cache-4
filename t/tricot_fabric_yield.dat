Having worked as a logger earlier in life, he was very aware of the danger in using and handling a chainsaw.

This was the start and the first-ever chainsaw protective fabric was born. Statistics showed a reduction in injuries at work-related accidents in forestry and logging.

This new hybrid 2 -level logic based <b>fabric</b> <b>yields</b> higher density for the applications mapped to it. When fault tolerance techniques are added it significantly improves fault tolerance. A nanoscale processor is implemented on this fabric for evaluation purposes. We found that compared with an implementation on a NASIC (Nanoscale Application Specific IC) fabric with one type of 2 -level logic, the density of this processor improves by up to 48 % by using the hybrid logic. Furthermore, the yield is improved by 22 % at 5 % defective transistors and by 4 X at 10 % defect rates. Detailed analysis on density and yield is provided.

40|$|To {{enable a}} {{realistic}} tactile interaction with remote or virtual objects, softness information represents a fundamental property to be rendered via haptic devices. What is challenging {{is to reduce}} the complexity of such an information as it arises from contact mechanics and to find suitable simplifications that can lead an effective development of softness displays. A possible approach is to surrogate detailed tactile cues with information on the rate of spread of the contact area between the object and the finger as the contact force increases, i. e. force/area relation. This paradigm is called contact area spread rate. In this paper we discuss how such a paradigm has inspired the design of a tactile device (hereinafter referred to as <b>Fabric</b> <b>Yielding</b> Display, FYD- 2), which exploits the elasticity of a fabric to mimic different levels of stiffness, while the contact area on the finger indenting the fabric is measured.

Laminates tested transverse to the pultrusion axis had greater fiber undulation and maximum of 44 % quasi-static strength reduction and 8 % stiffness reduction compared with axially tested specimens. While the matrix failure strain was 1. 9 %, failure strain of these laminates range over 1. 91 to 2. 08 % when tested along the pultrusion axis and as low as 1. 29 % transverse to the pultrusion axis. Fatigue evaluation, in load control mode, evaluated laminate SN, stiffness reduction, and residual strength. Measured S-N curves and residual strength curves compared with literature were found most like woven fabric laminates, well below aerospace grade laminates. Residual strength and life analysis using Reifsnider's methodology [43], revealed that the choice of quasi-static strength and stiffness, S-N curve, laminate stiffness reduction, and residual strength shape parameter, J, strongly affect predicted life. Predictions at high fatigue stress/low cycle were more exact than at low stress; the S-N curve was steep initially but at low stress/high cycle was nearly horizontal.

Crustal-scale exhumation during the intraplate Alice Springs Orogeny (c. 450 – 300 Ma) in central Australia has exposed the medium-pressure, high-grade metasedimentary and metabasaltic rocks of the Harts Range Group (HRG). Similarities in the detrital zircon age spectra and Lu–Hf-isotopic composition between the HRG and surrounding unmetamorphosed late Neoproterozoic–Cambrian Amadeus and Georgina basin sequences indicate the HRG {{is a highly}} metamorphosed equivalent to these basin successions. Calculated phase equilibria modelling and thermobarometry constrain peak metamorphic conditions to ~ 880 ºC and 10. 5 kbar and ~ 670 ºC and 7 kbar in the structurally lowest and highest parts of the HRG, respectively. Peak metamorphic assemblages are associated with extensive mafic magmatism, a coarse layer-parallel fabric and NE-side-down kinematics, the combination of which points to an extensional setting. Metamorphic conditions indicate a high geothermal gradient regime also existed during burial, manifested by the prograde development of andausite-bearing metapelite mineral assemblages. Monazite within prograde-zoned garnet and the enclosing <b>fabric</b> <b>yield</b> a U–Pb age of c. 442 Ma which is interpreted to record the timing of high-grade metamorphism of the upper HRG during continuation of the late Ordovician Larapinta Event (c. 480 – 460 Ma). Burial and metamorphism was synchronous with Centralian Superbasin sedimentation in central Australia and accordingly the deep burial, metamorphism and deformation of the HRG to mid-lower crustal depths must be justified {{in the context of}} the broader intraplate basin evolution. The HRG seems consistent with burial by sediment loading and associated high-grade metamorphism driven by elevated heat flows in a super-deep rift. This suggests that regional medium-pressure, high-grade metamorphic terranes may be generated in deep intraplate rift basins during extension and therefore are not necessarily reflective of compressional thickening of the crustThesis (B.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{microbial}} carbonates has acquired new significance with {{the recognition that}} they retain valuable information related to biomineralization processes associated with microbial activity throughout geological time. Additionally, microbialites have a demonstrated economic potential to serve as excellent hydrocarbon reservoirs. The Lower Cretaceous Codó Formation, located in the Parnaiba Basin of north-east Brazil, comprises a unique stratigraphic sequence of up to 20 m thick, well-preserved carbonate microbialites. Deposited in a continental basin during the initial break up and separation of South America from Africa in the Early Cretaceous, this lacustrine carbonate sequence provides an excellent example to investigate the palaeoenvironmental conditions controlling microbialite facies development. Based on macroscopic and microscopic observations of outcrop and drill core samples, four microbialite facies (stromatolite, lamina, massive and spherulite) were defined and distinguished by textures and microbial fossil content. Changes in facies type are related to alternating palaeo-water depths, as reflected by 87 Sr/ 86 Sr cycles resulting from fluctuations in the sources of meteoric water. Clumped isotope measurements of stromatolitic <b>fabrics</b> <b>yield</b> precipitation palaeo-temperatures with an average value of 35 °C.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} a model for the prediction of the formability of a multiaxial warp knitted (MWK) fabric to a 3 D surface. For this purpose, we first characterized in detail the forming behavior of MWK fabrics containing two bias inserting yarns (TBMWK fabric). Through experimental observation, it was found that the two bias inserting yarns always tend to gather along the weft direction. The angle between the two bias yarns has a linear relationship with the perpendicular distance from the measured points to the longitudinal axis of the hemisphere during forming process. The slope of this linear relationship is also linear with the magnitude of radius of the pressing hemisphere provided that the radius is larger than 7 cm. Based on the above finding, a mathematical model is established for predicting the deformations of TBMWK fabrics during the hemisphere-forming process. The shape of flat TBMWK <b>fabric</b> that can <b>yield</b> the corresponding hemisphere during the forming process as well as local deformations can be calculated through this model.

This paper extends the known backpressure architectures to the Benes network. To achieve this, we had to successfully combine per-flow backpressure, multipath routing (inverse multiplexing), and cell resequencing. We present a flow merging scheme that is needed to bring the cost of backpressure down to O(N) per switching element. We prove freedom from deadlock for a wide class of multipath cell distribution algorithms. Using a cell-time-accurate simulator, we verified operation free of internal blocking, we evaluated various cell distribution and resequencing methods, we found that delay under bursty traffic is only 25 to 50 percent higher than ideal output queueing, and we showed that the delay of well-behaved flows remains unaffected by the presence of congested traffic to oversubscribed output ports...|$|R

To achieve this, we had to successfully combine per-flow backpressure, multipath routing (inverse multiplexing), and cell resequencing. We, also, present a flow merging scheme that is needed to bring the cost of backpressure down to O(N) per switching element. We prove freedom from deadlock for a wide class of multipath cell distribution algorithms. Using a cell-time-accurate simulator, we evaluated various cell distribution and resequencing methods, we found that delay under bursty traffic is only 25 to 50 percent higher than ideal output queueing, and we showed that the delay of well-behaved flows remains unaffected by the presence of congested traffic to oversubscribed output ports. Using simplified models of the Benes fabric, we show that cell distribution does not result in throughput limitations, and identify the points of the fabric where contention is resolved...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} synthesis {{of two new}} remazol reactive dyes (Orange D and Black BE) having sulfo vinyl sulfone functionality for dyeing cotton <b>fabric.</b> The reaction <b>yield</b> was greater than 98 % for both the dyes and their purity (≥ 99 %) was determined by HPLC on BDS Hypersil C 18 (250 × 4. 6 mm, 5 µ) analytical column. As the dyes contain more reactive sulfonic acid groups, they display superior performance on dyeing cotton fabric compared to their reference dyes (Reactive Orange 2 R and Reactive Black B) used commercially. Due to enhanced water solubility, exhaustion method was used for dyeing cotton fabric. The degree of primary and secondary exhaustion from the dyeing bath was 62. 8 % and 84. 3 % for Orange D and 64. 1 % and 84. 4 % for Black BE respectively. Similarly, the fixation ratio and fixation yields were 85. 3 % and 71. 2 % for Orange D and 88. 1 % and 74. 3 % for Black BE respectively. The photo catalytic degradation of both the reactive dyes was studied in aqueous solution using TiO 2 -P 25 as a photo catalyst under solar and UV irradiation. Further, different operational parameters like pH of initial solution, contact time and initial dye concentration were optimized for dye degradatio...|$|R
40|$|A {{paucity of}} data from the Antarctic {{continent}} has resulted in conflicting interpretations of Neogene Antarctic glacial history. Much of the debate centres on interpretations of the glacigene Sirius Group strata that crop out as discrete deposits {{along the length of}} the Transantarctic Mountains and in particular on its age and the origin of the siliceous microfossils it encloses. Pliocene marine diatoms enclosed within Sirius Group strata are inferred to indicate a dynamic East Antarctic ice sheet that was much reduced, compared with today, in the early-middle Pliocene and then expanded again in the late Pliocene. However, the geomorphology of the Dry Valleys region is interpreted to represent a relatively long-lived (middle Miocene-recent) and stable polar climatic regime similar to that of today. The Mount Feather Diamicton infills a palaeovalley at ca. 2500 m on the NE flank of Mount Feather in the Dry Valleys region and has been included within the Sirius Group. We obtained four shallow cores (COMRAC 8, 9, 10 and 11) from beneath the permafrost boundary in the Mount Feather Diamicton in order to understand its origin and relationship with the surrounding landscape. Detailed studies of these cores (stratigraphy, sedimentology, palaeontology, micromorphology, petrography and <b>fabric)</b> have <b>yielded</b> new data that demonstrate a much more complex climatic and glacial history for the Mount Feather Diamicton than in previous interpretations. The data indicate that the Mount Feather Diamicton was deposited beneath a wet based glacier fed from a larger ice sheet behind the Transantarctic Mountains. It is, however, unlikely that this ice sheet overtopped Mount Feather (2985 m). A near-in situ non-marine diatom assemblage was recovered from 90 cm depth in COMRAC 10 and indicates a maximum depositional age of Late Miocene for the Mount Feather Diamicton. A subsequent glacial episode has distributed a boulder blanket across the surface of the diamicton. Other post-depositional processes include drying, infilling of surface layers with aeolian sediment, and the development of melt-water runnels. We interpret these combined data to indicate the persistence of more temperate climatic and glacial conditions in the vicinity of Mount Feather until at least the Late Miocene...|$|R
40|$|Acoustical {{insulation}} and absorption properties of nonwoven fabrics depend on fiber geometry and fiber arrangement within the fabric structure. The {{different structures of}} the fibers result in different total surface areas of nonwoven fabrics. Nonwoven fabrics such as vertically lapped fabrics are ideal materials for use as acoustical insulation products, because they have high total surface. Vertically lapped nonwoven technology consists of carding, perpendicular layering of the carded webs, and through-air bonding using synthetic binder fibers. The surface area of the fabric {{is directly related to}} the denier and cross-sectional shape of the fibers in the <b>fabric.</b> Smaller deniers <b>yield</b> more fibers per unit weight of the material, higher total fiber surface area, and greater possibilities for a sound wave to interact with the fibers in the fabric structure. The research in the literature uses two methods for measuring acoustical properties of fabric materials: the impedance tube and reverberation room method. Small test samples are in the impedance tube method and sound absorption coefficient is determined at each frequency. Large reverberation rooms and large test samples are used for the reverberation room method. A direct comparative acoustical properties measurement device that was designed and fabricated at Clemson University School of Materials Science & Engineering was used to measure acoustical insulation in this research. This paper provides a description of the measurement devices and acoustical measurement data for vertically lapped nonwoven fabrics made from three different polyester fiber shape and two denier levels...|$|R
