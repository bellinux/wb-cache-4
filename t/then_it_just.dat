500|$|I {{happened}} to be at Cambridge. I was sent there by the [...] government on a government grant. And I'd read some of Ted's poems in this magazine and I was very impressed and I wanted to meet him. I went to this little celebration and that's actually where we met... Then we saw {{a great deal of}} each other. Ted came back to Cambridge and suddenly we found ourselves getting married a few months later... We kept writing poems to each other. <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> grew out of that, I guess, a feeling that we both were writing so much and having such a fine time doing it, we decided that this should keep on.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade. [...] It was {{produced}} by American record producer Ron Aniello and was mixed by Brendan O'Brien. When asked about the song {{in an interview with}} Billboard, Wade said, [...] "It was the most uptempo, radio-friendly song. We all decided it was the right choice to release it as the first single." [...] He went on to describe his expectations when writing songs, saying, [...] "My ultimate goal in writing songs is to connect with people. In the lyrics, you don't tell the whole picture: You give a road to start on that people can relate to. We're honest, nice guys and I hope that comes across in everything we do." [...] After being asked how he wrote the song in an interview with Launch, Wade explained, [...] "I wrote that song without thinking about what was gonna happen to it and <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> kinda took over from there." [...] He also said in the interview that he wrote [...] "Hanging by a Moment" [...] in about five minutes.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club writer Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with a B+, {{explaining}} [...] "It was the atmosphere that sold me on [...] "Northwest Passage", an episode {{with a fairly}} middling mystery and only minimal advancement of the master-plot. (Though the end-point of that advancement was a doozy, and has me eating a little crow.) At times tonight the show almost felt like a backdoor pilot for a new series, with Peter tooling around the Pacific Northwest meeting local law enforcement and cracking cases. And while that's a show I'd definitely watch, I confess I'm anxious to jump ahead to next week, when there'll be inter-dimensional conflict and doppelgangers galore". Murray considered the ending {{with the appearance of}} Walternate a [...] "strong finish to a mostly strong episode". IGN's Ramsey Isler gave it 7.8/10, writing that [...] "Fringe sophomore season is building up to an epic 2-part finale. This episode doesn't reveal much in terms of overall Fringe mythology until the very awesome ending, and even <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> confirms what we already knew or suspected. Still, this installment deserves credit for using a different formula and giving Joshua Jackson some much-deserved time in the spotlight all by himself".|$|E

And how d'ye think that hole comes there, barring all oversights in setting up the sticks?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Aquarian, Swan described the band as [...] "a little side project that I do double guitar work on and <b>then</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>just</b> our bass player, our screamer and our drummer." [...] He continued, [...] "It’s pretty much overall Downtown Battle Mountain II without Jonny Craig. We just decided to do just a little side project for fun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{the boys}} say it's not stealing. Stealing is hooking a {{thing out of}} a wagon or a store; {{but if you can}} knock a thing off a tree, or get it through a fence, when it's on the ground already, <b>then</b> <b>it's</b> <b>just</b> like {{gathering}} nuts in the woods. That's what the boys say. Do you think it is?" ...|$|R
2500|$|I'd {{been driving}} {{a bunch of}} {{managing}} changes, and then I originally took the UNIX tools and made them available on Windows, and <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> didn't work. Right? Because there's a core architectural difference between Windows and Linux. On Linux, everything's an ASCII text file, so anything that can manipulate that is a managing tool. [...] AWK, grep, sed? Happy days! ...|$|E
2500|$|In a post-show {{interview}} clip on Austin City Limits, guitarist Munaf Rayani {{said about}} {{their status as}} instrumentalists, [...] "I mean, I think we discussed singing for half a second, and <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> kinda, we just dropped it. We just didn't go back to it because we were comfortable enough." [...] Drummer Chris Hrasky added, [...] "I think we just {{liked the idea of}} a band that there was not a leader or main songwriter, everyone sort of collaborating and has their own say. I don't think any of us want the sort of 'leader role', so a leaderless band is kind of the best option for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for Power 106, Gomez spoke in-depth about the inspiration behind [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", saying: [...] "Everybody has had a say in my life [...] meaning the world, the perception, the media. It was really frustrating. There is a song on my record called ‘Kill Em with Kindness.’ So I’ve always done that. I ignore, I ignore, I ignore. And <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> kind of got out of hand. So I went to the new label [...] and I was like, I have to say something. I need to say what I want to say, and you guys {{have to help me}} {{figure out how to do}} that." [...] While working on the album, Gomez enlisted frequent collaborators Rock Mafia to help make her sound a reality. They helped Gomez on the creation of six tracks on the album, including [...] "Revival" [...] and [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", the latter being one of the most personal tracks on Revival. She told the producers that although the production was important, she wanted the focus of the song to be the lyrics.|$|E

5000|$|Felix Buxton told PopMatters: [...] "As we {{were very}} keen on kind of doing a double-album. And <b>then</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>just</b> one of those things: you feel in your {{progressive}} rock phase. It’s very Spinal Tap to do a double-album, and acts sometimes take themselves too seriously, so we were at that point {{where we want to}} take ourselves seriously; and also we also always enjoy doing the soundscape stuff." ...|$|R
2500|$|All of {{the explosions}} {{in the movie}} were filmed in one shot, {{as opposed to a}} typical film where each would have been covered by {{multiple}} cameras. Russell explained, [...] "to me that's more real. The car's blowing up on this guy, and we just park the camera. Of course the producer says, 'we gotta run three cameras!' But if I cut three ways, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> looks like an action picture." [...] Russell also had the Foley department tone down the sounds of gunfire, saying he didn't want to [...] "Bruce Willis-ize" [...] the film." [...] One frequently noted shot in the film is an image of a bullet piercing a number of internal organs, releasing bile into the abdominal cavity, used when Gates is describing sepsis as the effect of a gunshot wound. This internal camera is again used when SFC Barlow is shot in the torso and his chest begins to fill with air, crushing his lung. Both of these scenes were inspired by Russell asking an emergency room doctor friend [...] "What's the weirdest wound you've ever seen?" [...] It also erupted a minor controversy, when Russell began to joke around that the gunshots were fired into a real corpse; a statement everyone vehemently denied later.|$|E

But, <b>then,</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> suits Lillie; and it's so sweet and patient of her to come here and give it all up, and say not a word of regret; and then, you see, I shall be just up to my ears in {{business}} now, and can't give up all my time to her, as I have. There's ever so much law business coming on, and all the factory matters at Spindlewood; and I can see that Lillie will have rather a hard time of it. You must devote yourself to her, Gracie, like a dear, good soul, as you always were, and try to get her interested in our kind of life. Of course, all our set will call, and that will be something; and then--there will be some invitations out." ...|$|E

"Now," [...] {{he began}} with some diffidence, [...] "you {{cut me off}} short when I met you the other day, {{and one of my}} reasons for coming over was to get through with what I was saying <b>then.</b> <b>It's</b> <b>just</b> this--I owe you a good deal for taking care of Kitty; she's very {{grateful}} and thinks no end of you.

"The farmer {{was pretty}} busy that summer, {{and after the}} first two or three hoeings {{he had to leave}} the two pumpkin vines to the boy that had helped him to plant the seed, and the boy had to go fishing so much, and then in swimming, that he {{perfectly}} neglected them, and let them run wild, if they wanted to; and if the good little pumpkin vine had not been the best little pumpkin vine that ever was, it would have run wild. But it just stayed where it was, and thickened up, and covered itself with blossoms, till it was like one mass of gold. It was very fond of all its blossoms, and it couldn't bear hardly to think of losing any of them; but it knew they couldn't every one {{grow up to be a}} very large pumpkin, and so it let them gradually drop off till it only had one left, and <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> gave all its attention to that one, and did everything it could to make it grow into the kind of pumpkin it said it would.|$|E
60|$|It {{happened}} the night I {{went down to}} see Kitty Marr. I thought when I went that Aunt Olivia was visiting there and I could come home with her. But she wasn't there and I had to come home alone. Kitty came {{a piece of the}} way but she wouldn't come any further than Uncle James Frewen's gate. She said it was because it was so windy she was afraid she would get the tooth-ache and not because she was frightened of the ghost of the dog that haunted the bridge in Uncle James' hollow. I did wish she hadn't said anything about the dog because I mightn't of thought about it if she hadn't. I had to go on alone thinking of it. I'd heard the story often but I'd never believed in it. They said the dog used to appear {{at one end of the}} bridge and walk across it with people and vanish when he got to the other end. He never tried to bite anyone but one wouldn't want to meet the ghost of a dog even if one didn't believe in him. I knew there was no such thing as ghosts and I kept saying a paraphrase over to myself and the Golden Text of the next Sunday School lesson but oh, how my heart beat when I got near the hollow! It was so dark. You could just see things dim-like but you couldn't see what they were. When I got to the bridge I walked along sideways with my back to the railing so I couldn't think the dog was behind me. And then just in the middle of the bridge I met something. It was right before me and it was big and black, just about the size of a Newfoundland dog, and I thought I could see a white nose. And it kept jumping about from one side of the bridge to the other. Oh, I hope none of my readers will ever be so frightened as I was then. I was too frightened to run back because I was afraid it would chase me and I couldn't get past it, it moved so quick, and <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> made one spring right on me and I felt its claws and I screamed and fell down. It rolled off to one side and laid there quite quiet but I didn't dare move and I don't know what would have become of me if Amos Cowan hadn't come along that very minute with a lantern. And there was me sitting in the middle of the bridge and that awful thing beside me. And what do you think it was but a big umbrella with a white handle? Amos said it was his umbrella and it had blown away from him and he had to go back and get the lantern to look for it. I felt like asking him what on earth he was going about with an umbrella open when it wasent raining. But the Cowans do such queer things. You remember the time Jerry Cowan sold us God's picture. Amos took me right home and I was thankful for I don't know what would have become of me if he hadn't come along. I couldn't sleep all night and I never want to have any more adventures like that one.|$|E

5000|$|An {{initially}} planned North American tour {{after the}} release was cancelled. Band leader Bill Leeb commented on this, saying [...] "We have had too many problems putting the tour together, {{and the bottom line}} is, if we can't put on a good show for you the fans, <b>then</b> <b>it's</b> <b>just</b> not worth it." [...] Nevertheless, Front Line Assembly headed out to tour Europe in support of Improvised Electronic Device in fall 2010. The band continued touring from May to June 2011 in North America and returned to Europe from August to September 2011.|$|R
5000|$|Gonz is {{the most}} {{influential}} skater of all times, no question. Mark Gonzales created how to street skate, for doing handrails and things {{that no one has}} ever done. When people were doing a boardslide on the rail and people thought that was super crazy, he was doing 180 nosegrinds and 180 fakie 50-50s. The best and most technical skater today doing the hardest tricks beyond what anyone could think of is not doing what Gonz was doing <b>then.</b> <b>It’s</b> <b>just</b> not the same.

5000|$|The {{film was}} not without its detractors. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{dismissed}} the film, giving it two out of four stars, stating that the film is well crafted, yet dies down {{in the last half}} hour: [...] "The film is like a crossword puzzle. It keeps your interest until you solve <b>it.</b> <b>Then</b> <b>it's</b> <b>just</b> a worthless scrap with the spaces filled in." [...] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune also gave a negative review, calling it psychologically empty: [...] "Verhoeven does not explore the dark side, but merely exploits it, and that makes {{all the difference in the}} world." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "Cedars of Lebanon" [...] {{is a song}} by Irish {{rock band}} U2. It is the {{eleventh}} and final track on their 2009 album No Line on the Horizon.

Nevertheless, it was what it was, which is saying it is what it is, but back then. And I don't regret it.
