5|$|Helena was {{a lively}} and outspoken child, and reacted against brotherly teasing by {{punching}} the bully on the nose. Her early talents included drawing. Lady Augusta Stanley, a lady-in-waiting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Queen,</b> commented favourably on the three-year-old Helena's artwork.|$|E
5|$|Helena was {{closest to}} her brother, Prince Alfred, who {{considered}} her his favourite sister. Though described by contemporaries as fearfully devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Queen,</b> {{to the point}} that she did not have a mind of her own, she actively campaigned for women's rights, a field the Queen abhorred. Nevertheless, both she and Beatrice remained closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Queen,</b> and Helena remained close to her mother's side until the latter's death. Her name was the last to be written in the Queen's seventy-year-old journal.|$|E

50|$|The first Great Steamboat Race {{was held}} in 1963 between the Belle of Louisville and <b>the</b> Delta <b>Queen,</b> {{establishing}} <b>the</b> traditional rivalry until 2008 when <b>the</b> <b>Queen</b> was retired. <b>The</b> <b>Queen</b> won <b>the</b> first race. As of <b>the</b> Delta <b>Queens</b> last race in 2008, the Louisville won 22 races compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Queens</b> 20 wins. <b>The</b> Louisvilles winning record compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Queens</b> larger size and more powerful engines has helped fuel the unproven speculation that the race is predetermined.|$|R

5|$|Worker {{policing}} {{occurs when}} worker bees {{in the colony}} are genetically more closely related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>queen</b> than the reproductive female.

5|$|A year later, at {{the height}} of the 1975 Australian {{constitutional}} crisis, the Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed from his post by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, after the Opposition-controlled Senate rejected Whitlam's budget proposals. As Whitlam had a majority in the House of Representatives, Speaker Gordon Scholes appealed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Queen</b> to reverse Kerr's decision. She declined, stating that she would not interfere in decisions reserved by the Constitution of Australia for the governor-general. The crisis fuelled Australian republicanism.|$|E

The pear-shaped drop diamonds each weigh about 20carats (4g). Diana, Princess of Wales, borrowed them in 1983 to wear on her first official visit to Australia.

5|$|By {{virtue of}} the Iberian Union that joined the crowns of Portugal and Spain in 1580, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 had fallen in abeyance. As the Anglo–Spanish War was ongoing, Portuguese {{shipping}} was a fair target for the Royal Navy. Sir Walter Raleigh, having only just been released from the Tower of London, received a commission from Queen Elizabeth I for an expedition to the West Indies. He outfitted a sixteen ship naval squadron of which two, the Garland and Foresight belonged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Queen.</b>|$|E

5|$|Drones {{can also}} mate with {{existing}} queens by entering a foreign colony. When the drone is initially {{attacked by the}} workers, it releases a mating pheromone. If recognized as a mate, it will be carried <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>queen</b> to mate. Males may also patrol the nest and fight others by grabbing them with their mandibles, piercing their exoskeleton and then marking them with a pheromone. The marked male is interpreted as an invader by worker ants and is killed.|$|E
5|$|Helena, as promised, lived close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Queen,</b> {{and both}} she and Beatrice {{performed}} duties for her. Beatrice, whom Victoria had groomed for the main role at her side, carried out the more important duties, and Helena took on the more minor matters that Beatrice {{did not have time}} to do. In later years, Helena was assisted by her unmarried daughter, Helena Victoria, to whom the Queen dictated her journal in the last months of her life.|$|E

5|$|Norton was {{the subject}} of many tales; one popular story {{suggested}} {{he was the son of}} Emperor Napoleon III, and that his claim of coming from South Africa was a ruse to prevent persecution. Another popular story suggested Norton was planning to marry Queen Victoria.

Rumors also circulated that Norton was supremely wealthy—only affecting poverty because he was miserly.|$|E
