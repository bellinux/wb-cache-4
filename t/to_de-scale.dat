40|$|The archaeological bone {{assemblage}} of Hardinxveld-Giessendam Polderweg (5500 - 5000 BC) and De Bruin (5500 - 4450 BC), includes remains which allow investigating {{the importance of}} plant working and the fishing technologies for Late Mesolithic wetland communities of the Rhine Meuse region. The main emphasis of this thesis is on the microwear analysis of the worked bones in comparison with experimental and archaeological data. The sample selected displays different kinds of evidences of contact with soft plant on the bone tools, such as Urtica dioica and Salix: therefore it has been organized through a functional classification according to the variability of contact materials and the distribution and polish of the wear. The tool-type identified are Spatula-spacers to weave or make fishing nets; De-scaling tools, <b>to</b> <b>de-scale</b> {{the skin of the}} fish; awls and Projectile-awls, to pierce bark; Ad hoc elongated tools in bird bone, to work Urtica dioica; Harpoons and Decorated objects. This evidence for different plantbased crafts has been heavily challenged by problems of conservation and taphonomy, which influenced the readability of the sample. Post-excavation processes have been investigated from a microscopic point of view, allowing the identification of cleaning paper and plastic sieve wear traces that are evident on the bone surface. The state of the bone assemblage opened a window on more theoretical issues; concerning the interpretation of hidden crafts in archaeology. The research has been directed towards a reasonable (sensu Putnam) system of data comparison, involving contextual, ethnographic and anthropological data, with the aim to propose a theoretical toolkit for better understand the Forma mentis of the inhabitants of Hardinxveld-Giessendam...|$|E
