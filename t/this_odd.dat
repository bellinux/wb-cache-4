5|$|A classic {{result of}} graph theory states that a graph of odd order (having an odd number of vertices) always {{has at least}} one vertex of even degree. (The {{statement}} itself requires zero to be even: the empty graph has an even order, and an isolated vertex has an even degree.) In order to prove the statement, it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph has an odd number of even degree vertices. The appearance of <b>this</b> <b>odd</b> number is explained by a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree. Finally, the even number of odd vertices is naturally explained by the degree sum formula.|$|E

One {{of the men}} was 54-year-old Glenn Hollinshead – a {{self-employed}} welder, qualified paramedic, and former RAF worker. The other man was his friend Peter Molloy. Sabina appeared friendly and stroked the dog as the three people struck up a conversation. Although friendly, Sabina appeared to be behaving oddly and <b>this</b> <b>odd</b> behaviour worried Molloy. Sabina asked the two men for directions to any nearby bed and breakfasts or hotels. Hollinshead took pity upon her and instead offered to take her back to his house at Duke Street, Fenton. Sabina accepted the offer and the three walked to the house, as Sabina told the men how {{she was trying to}} locate her hospitalised sister.|$|E
5|$|Cortinarius violaceus was {{designated}} as the type species for the genus Cortinarius by Frederic Clements and Cornelius Lott Shear in their 1931 work The Genera of Fungi. Mycologist David Arora considers <b>this</b> <b>odd,</b> due to the mushroom's unusual colour and cystidia. Because of this designation, if C.violaceus were to be split {{from the rest of}} the current genus, then, according to the rules of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, it would retain the name Cortinarius, while the other species would have to be reclassified. The species was one of only two placed in the Cortinarius subgenus Cortinarius by the Austrian mycologist Meinhard Moser. Molecular investigation of webcaps worldwide has increased this number to at least twelve.|$|E

25|$|When she {{is found}} in the temple by the priest she is praying silently, but her lips are moving. A priest called Eli {{witnesses}} <b>this</b> <b>odd</b> posture and concludes she is drunk. In her despair she prays to God for a child and if her prayer is granted she will give the son back to God. After Hannah's explanation of her sobriety, Eli blesses her with peace and a guarantee that God of Israel will grant her request. She goes home, eats and drinks with her husband, and is filled with hope. Subsequently, Hannah becomes pregnant; her child is named Samuel. The time comes to offer the yearly sacrifice at the temple but Hannah stays home. She promises to go to the temple when Samuel is weaned and plans to leave him with Eli to be trained as a Nazirite.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Chestre {{wrote an}} Arthurian romance Lybeaus Desconus in the late-fourteenth century {{in which a}} young man arrives at King Arthur's court not knowing his own name, having been brought up in {{seclusion}} in the forest by his mother. Despite his inexperience at fighting, he asks, like the fool Ipomadon, that the first request to the king for a champion be given to him. King Arthur, like King Meleager, complies with <b>this</b> <b>odd</b> request, having named the young man the Fair Unknown. Soon afterwards, a maiden called Ellyne appears asking for a champion to defeat her mistress's enemies. Like Ipomadon, the Fair Unknown reminds the king of his promise, and {{to the consternation of}} the damsel and her dwarf, is allowed to set off with her. Only by proving himself in combat during the journey, like Ipomadon when he follows the angry maiden Imayne disguised as a fool, does the Fair Unknown stem the scorn, derision and verbal abuse heaped upon him by a far from happy maiden. Like Imayne too, Ellyne falls in love with her knight as he begins to prove himself in combat. At the end of the journey, of course, they both rescue their respective ladies.|$|E

500|$|The début album, Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance (1988), is {{a double}} vinyl release in an {{embossed}} gatefold sleeve. The first record contained twelve of TISM's most popular tracks, and the second was a pastiche of interviews, bedroom recordings and live diatribes. Despite <b>this</b> <b>odd</b> combination, Truckin' Songs entered the lower reaches of Australia's mainstream Top 50, as did the single [...] "Saturday Night Palsy". Later that year, The TISM Guide To Little Aesthetics, a book compiling lyrics, interviews and press releases, was published.

This {{has often been}} branded as Gill Sans Ultra Bold, though in practice many letters vary considerably from Gill Sans. It is available in regular and condensed widths.

[...] Forty years later he described it as [...] "the most horrendous and blackguardly of these display exploitations".
