5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century unknown to {{everyone}} including his family, socialist patriot Manwel Dimech was imprisoned by the British at the Castellania until a well planned forced {{exit from the}} country on 5 September 1914, which <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> exile and never to come to Malta again. A plaque in the whereabouts of the Victoria Gate, where Dimech had to pass before boarding on a ship, commemorates the episode. The imprisonment of Dimech at the Castellania, and his exile abroad, is considered as a landmark injustice during the British period.|$|E
25|$|In 1929, {{after many}} struggles, he {{finally managed to}} settle {{in the village of}} Taxiarches (Sipsa), in Drama, Northern Greece, where he lived the {{remaining}} thirty years of his life.

25|$|The {{monument}} {{was designed}} by Laurence Krone, a prolific Virginia-German carver. Its design featuring a carving of a child, although commonplace in New England during the period, is unique to Southwest Virginia. Krone met the Dentons after the family <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> after falling ill {{at the turn of}} the 19th century. Due to the generosity of the family, Krone carved the monument free of charge upon the death of Robert Denton.|$|E

25|$|After the Simbolul moment, Marcel Janco {{worked at}} Seara daily, {{where he took}} further {{training}} in draftsmanship. The newspaper <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> as illustrator, probably {{as a result of}} intercessions from Vinea, its literary columnist. Their Simbolul colleague Costin joined them as Searas cultural editor. Janco was also a visitor of the literary and art club meeting at the home of controversial politician and Symbolist poet Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, who was for a while the manager of Seara.|$|E
25|$|When {{asked about}} his religion, Armstrong would answer that he was raised a Baptist, always wore a Star of David, and was friends with the Pope. Armstrong wore the Star of David {{in honor of the}} Karnofsky family, who <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> as a child and lent him the money to buy his first cornet. Louis Armstrong was, in fact, baptized as a Catholic at the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church in New Orleans, and he met popes Pius XII and Paul VI, though there is no {{evidence}} that he considered himself Catholic. Armstrong seems to have been tolerant towards various religions, but also found humor in them.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, King {{followed}} Bukka White to Memphis, Tennessee. White <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> for {{the next}} ten months. However, King returned to Mississippi shortly afterward, where he decided to prepare himself better {{for the next}} visit, and returned to West Memphis, Arkansas, two years later in 1948. He performed on Sonny Boy Williamson's radio program on KWEM in West Memphis, where he began to develop an audience. King's appearances led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA. The radio spot became so popular that it was expanded and became the Sepia Swing Club.|$|E

25|$|Worf {{was born}} in 2340 on Qo'noS (the Klingon homeworld) {{as the son of}} Mogh. Five years later, his parents moved to the Khitomer colony. Worf's parents were killed during a {{surprise}} attack by the Romulans on the Khitomer outpost. The colony's distress call was answered by the Federation starship USS Intrepid. Chief Petty Officer Sergey Rozhenko found Worf in the rubble and <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> after failing to find any living relatives. Rozhenko and his wife Helena raised him on a small farm colony on the planet Gault, a world of about 20,000 inhabitants, almost all of them human. Worf also has a human brother, Nikolai, with whom he often quarreled. He also spent time on Earth in his parents' native city of Minsk, later recommending it to Miles O'Brien as one of his favorite places on Earth.|$|E
25|$|In {{an earlier}} work, Le Maghreb entre deux guerres ("The Maghreb between two world wars", 1962), Berque criticizes the colonial system. His {{administrative}} and ethnographic experience eventually <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a direction adopted by few North-African-born Frenchmen or by colonial administrators: {{he came out}} in favour of independence. Berque {{was one of the}} few Europeans who retained links with the new Algeria after the bloody war. As the theoretician of third-worldist romanticism, he became influential to the entire Arab-Muslim world, and even of the Third World as a whole. Another work on the Maghreb, L'Interieur du Maghreb, XVe-XIXe siecle (1978), gives Berque's own interpretation of its history. Based on a reading of 15 texts which he had taught at the Collège de France, the book runs to more than 500 pages, and is an important document on the history of the Maghreb.|$|E
25|$|Lenz then {{returned}} to Emmendingen, where the Schlossers <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>in.</b> From there he {{made a number of}} journeys into Alsace and Switzerland, including one to Lavater in Zürich in May 1777. The news of Cornelia Schlosser's death, which reached him there in June of that year, had a powerful effect on him. He returned to Emmendingen, and then went back to Lavater. In November, while staying in Winterthur with Christoph Kaufmann, he suffered an attack of paranoid schizophrenia. In January 1778 Kaufmann sent Lenz to the philanthropist, social reformer and clergyman Johann Friedrich Oberlin in Waldersbach in Alsace, where he stayed from 20 January to 8 February. Despite the care of Oberlin and his wife, Lenz's mental condition grew worse. He returned to Schlosser at Emmendingen, where he was lodged with a shoemaker and then a forester.|$|E

25|$|Although he {{was legally}} {{accepted}} as a legitimate child, his parents did not accept him. The Truffauts had another child who died shortly after birth. This experience saddened them greatly {{and as a result}} they despised François because of the memory of regret that he represented (Knopf 4). He was an outcast from his earliest years, dismissed as an unwanted child. François was sent to live with his grandparents. It wasn't until François's grandmother's death before his parents <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>in,</b> much to the dismay of his own mother. The experiences with his mother were harsh. He recalled being treated badly by her but he found comfort in his father's laughter and overall spirit. The relationship with Roland was more comforting than the one with his own mother. François had a very depressing childhood after moving in with his parents. They would leave him alone whenever they would go on vacations. He even recalled memories of being alone during Christmas. Being left alone forced François into a sense of independence, he would often do various tasks around the house in order to improve it such as painting or changing the electric outlets. Sadly, these kind gestures often resulted in a catastrophic event causing him to get scolded by his mother. His father would mostly laugh them off.|$|E
500|$|Merrick {{arrived at}} Liverpool Street Station on 24 June 1886, safely {{back in his}} own country, but with nowhere to go. He was not {{eligible}} to enter a workhouse in London {{for more than one}} night and would be accepted only by Leicester Union, where he was a permanent resident. Leicester was [...] away. He approached strangers for help, but his speech was unintelligible and his appearance repugnant. He drew a crowd of curious onlookers until a policeman helped him into an empty waiting room, where he huddled in a corner, exhausted. Unable to make himself understood, his only identifying possession was Frederick Treves's card. The police contacted Treves, who went to the station. Recognising Merrick, Treves <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a hansom cab to the London Hospital. Merrick was admitted for bronchitis, washed, fed and put to bed in a small isolation room in the hospital's attic.|$|E
500|$|In August 1991 he {{returned}} to England with a £100,000 move to Port Vale; {{he was one of}} three new arrivals, along with Peter Swan (who <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> as a lodger) and Martin Foyle. He scored a brace against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux on 3 September, but tore his hamstring later in the month. He finished 1991–92 with five goals in 24 games, and went on to help the [...] "Valiants" [...] to win the TNT Tournament in the summer. The club finished bottom of the Second Division, though the introduction of the Premier League meant that they were demoted to the Third Division, which was immediately re-branded as the Second Division. He scored six goals in 28 league games in 1992–93, and did not feature in the League Trophy final or the play-off final. He fell out with manager John Rudge and the two stopped speaking to each other, and Houchen later admitted that [...] "I should have knocked on the door and said, 'This is stupid'".|$|E

500|$|According {{to his own}} account, he {{initially}} hid in a large bush, but decided this was too obvious, and so moved to a smaller one. A German patrol arrived, examined the original bush, and attacked it with bursts of automatic gunfire before leaving. [...] "Somebody was {{keeping an eye on}} me when I thought I'd better get out of that bush..." [...] he later told Phillippa Berlyn. The area in which he had landed was predominantly anti-German, and largely under the control of pro-Allied Italian partisans; one of these saw Smith's descent and retrieved his parachute to stop the Germans from finding it. Smith hid for a while longer before emerging to greet a boy of about 12. The boy, Leo, knew no English; using sign language, he told Smith to sit and wait, and shortly returned with his elder brother, Lorenzo. Lorenzo proposed that Smith come to their home to eat, and Smith accepted. The boys' parents, peasant farmers named Zunino, <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>in,</b> but decided it was too risky to keep him at the house so soon after the crash, and hid him in a cave on the mountain. The next day, the Germans came to the Zuninos' house, looking for Smith. After about a week, the danger had subsided, and the Zuninos gave Smith a room in the house.|$|E
500|$|Lansbury was 76 {{years old}} when he {{resigned}} the Labour leadership; he did not, however, retire from public life. In the general election of November 1935 he kept his [...] seat at Bow and Bromley; Labour, now led by Attlee, improved its parliamentary representation to 154. Lansbury devoted himself entirely to the cause of world peace, a quest that <b>took</b> <b>him,</b> <b>in</b> [...] 1936, to the United States. He addressed large crowds in [...] 27 cities before meeting President Roosevelt in Washington to present his proposals for a world peace conference. In 1937 he toured Europe, visiting leaders in Belgium, France and Scandinavia, and in April [...] secured a private meeting with [...] Hitler. No official report of the discussion was issued, but Lansbury's personal memorandum indicates that Hitler expressed willingness to join in a world conference if Roosevelt would convene it. Later that year Lansbury met Mussolini in Rome; he described the Italian leader [...] as [...] "a mixture of Lloyd George, Stanley Baldwin and Winston Churchill". Lansbury wrote several accounts of his peace journeys, notably My Quest for Peace (1938). His mild and optimistic impressions of the European dictators were widely criticised as naïve and out of touch; some British pacifists were dismayed at Lansbury's meeting with Hitler, while the Daily Worker accused him of diverting attention from the aggressive realities of fascist policies. [...] Lansbury continued to meet European leaders through 1938 and 1939, and [...] was nominated, unsuccessfully, for the 1940 Nobel Peace Prize.|$|E
