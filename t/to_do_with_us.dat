The twins who play the part (Jaden and Ella Hiller) were not happy. We started feeling like we were just being mean to these little girls, making them come to the stage. And the character is reaching an age where she would talk, and {{that was going to}} be an asset to us to have Cam and Mitch communicating with her." ...|$|E
500|$|Lydon, in turn, would dismiss McLaren's influence: [...] "We {{made our}} own scandal {{just by being}} ourselves. Maybe {{it was that he}} knew he was redundant, so he overcompensated. All the talk about the French Situationists being {{associated}} with punk is bollocks. It's nonsense!" [...] Cook concurs: [...] "Situationism had nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> The Jamie Reids and Malcolms were excited because we were the real thing. I suppose we were what they were dreaming of." [...] According to Lydon, [...] "If we had an aim, it was to force our own, working-class opinions into the mainstream, which was unheard of in pop music at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{subsequent}} decade, two pioneers {{of the style}} became increasingly commercially viable. According to Nielsen Soundscan, Napalm Death sold 367,654 units between May 1991 and November 2003, while Carcass sold 220,374 units in the same period. The inclusion of Napalm Death's [...] "Twist the Knife (Slowly)" [...] on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack brought the band much greater visibility, as the compilation scored a Top 10 position in the Billboard 200 chart and went platinum {{in less than a}} year.< The originators of the style have expressed some ambivalence regarding {{the subsequent}} popularity of grindcore. Pete Hurley, the guitarist of Extreme Noise Terror, declared that he had no interest in being remembered as a pioneer of this style: [...] "'grindcore' was a legendarily stupid term coined by a hyperactive kid from the West Midlands, and it had nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> whatsoever. ENT were, are, and - I suspect - always will be a hardcore punk band... not a grindcore band, a stenchcore band, a trampcore band, or any other sub-sub-sub-core genre-defining term you can come up with." [...] Lee Dorian of Napalm Death indicated that [...] "Unfortunately, I think the same thing happened to grindcore, {{if you want to call}} it that, as happened to punk rock - all the great original bands were just plagiarised by a billion other bands who just copied their style identically, making it no longer original and no longer extreme." ...|$|E

2500|$|Richards and Jagger {{began their}} songwriting {{partnership}} in 1963 at {{the insistence of}} manager Andrew Loog Oldham who saw no long career in playing covers. The earliest Jagger/Richards collaborations were recorded by other artists, including Gene Pitney, whose rendition of [...] "That Girl Belongs to Yesterday" [...] was their first top-ten single in the UK. They scored another top-ten hit in 1964 with the debut single written for Marianne Faithfull, [...] "As Tears Go By". Richards recalls: [...] "We were writing these terrible pop songs that were becoming top ten hits... They had nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> except we wrote 'em." ...|$|E

60|$|After our sunrise bath, Bob {{once more}} placed {{us in the}} stocks, almost moved to tears at {{subjecting}} us to so great a hardship; {{but he could not}} treat us otherwise, he said, on pain of the consul's displeasure.

2500|$|Following {{the capture}} of the port of Rabaul, Japanese forces {{turned it into a}} major base and {{proceeded}} to land on mainland New Guinea, advancing toward Port Moresby. Heavy fighting followed along the Kokoda Track, and around Milne Bay, before the Japanese were eventually pushed back towards Buna–Gona by early 1943. As part of Operation Cartwheel, throughout 1943–1945, Allied forces later sought to isolate the Japanese garrison on Rabaul, rather than capturing it, largely using air power <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, <b>with</b> <b>US</b> and Australian ground forces pursuing a limited campaign in western New Britain during this time.|$|R
