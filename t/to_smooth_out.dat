5|$|M-204 {{was first}} {{designated}} on July 12, 1933 between Leland and Suttons Bay along what is today Duck Lake Road. The highway was paved {{by the middle}} of 1936. The road was realigned on July 13, 1939, across the narrows of Lake Leelanau in the village of the same name. Another realignment near Suttons Bay was completed on March 26, 1956, <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> a curve in the road. A second completed on May 4, 1956, straightened a curve by Sylt Road east of Lake Leelanau. The western section was completely rebuilt between Duck Lake Corner and the Lake Leelanau Narrows Bridge <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> curves in the roadway. Sections not obliterated by the reconstruction were turned over to local control as Main Street or Old M-204 in Lake Leelanau when the project was finished on July 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|After a {{company-wide}} {{contest to}} name the aircraft, the initial prototype received the name Pirate and made its first flight on 2 October 1946. Flight testing revealed severe aerodynamic problems, mostly caused by the airfoil section and thickness of the wing. The vertical stabilizer also had to be redesigned <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> the airflow {{at the intersection of}} the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. Other changes included the addition of dive brakes {{on the sides of the}} fuselage and the replacement of the Metalite panels near the engine's exhaust with stainless steel ones.|$|E
5|$|M-26 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with US45 east of Rockland in Michigan's Ontonagon County. From there it {{runs through the}} town of Mass City to the junction with M-38 east of Greenland. The two highways join for a short distance before M-26 separates turning northeast to Winona across the Houghton County line. In Twin Lakes M-26 passes {{the shores of the}} namesake lakes and Twin Lakes State Park. M-26 passes through wooded, hilly terrain in western Houghton County. The segment of roadway in South Range was recently realigned <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> curves in the roadway. From there north, M-26 runs generally downhill on approaching the western business district of Houghton and the Portage Lake Lift Bridge from the west.|$|E

His upbringing also makes him aware of the common people. He has a shopkeeper friend in Riva who he periodically visits to listen to what's troubling commoners. Rather than use this to ferret out secrets, he usually applies what he learns <b>to</b> <b>smoothing</b> <b>out</b> injustices, such as an unfair tax.|$|R

5|$|When the US Highway System {{was formed}} on November 11, 1926, US141 ran from Milwaukee to Green Bay, and one {{segment of the}} modern highway in Michigan was {{originally}} designated US102. This other designation was decommissioned in 1928 when US141 was extended north from Green Bay into Michigan. Michigan has rebuilt the highway in stages over the years <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> sharp curves in the routing. Since the 1960s, the section south of Green Bay has {{been converted into a}} freeway in segments. US141 has ended southeast of Green Bay in Bellevue since the 1980s—the southern freeway segment was redesignated as I-43. The section north of Abrams, Wisconsin, was converted to a freeway in the opening years of the 21st century, with an additional divided-highway section opening a few years later.|$|E
5|$|M-49 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1930, running along its current routing between M-9 (now M-99) in Litchfield and the Ohio state line south of Camden. Near the state line, the highway jogged along Territorial Road for a short {{distance}} to make the connection with the continuation of SR49. The second version of M-120 ran concurrently with M-49 on this section of Territorial Road starting in 1939. This concurrency was removed in late 1946 or early 1947 when M-49 was realigned <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> the corners in the roadway at M-120. The routing of M-49 has remained the same since. It is currently the only state highway that connects with a like-numbered state highway from another state. The only other highways in Michigan to share a number with a cross-border connection are components of the Interstate Highway System or the United States Numbered Highways.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{back in the}} restaurant, the {{waitress}} returns to find the woman missing. Believing that the woman has left without paying the bill, she angrily crumples and throws the woman's comic book into a bin. This makes the hero's two opposing racers reappear, armed with a large pipe wrench. The racers smash the looking glass with the pipe wrench, trapping {{the woman in the}} comic book. The hero punches one of the thugs and retreats with the woman into a maze of paper. Arriving at a dead end, he tears a hole in the paper wall so that the woman can escape as the menacing opposing racers close in on him. The woman, now back in the real world and found lying beside the bin to the surprise of restaurant guests and staff, retrieves the comic from the bin and runs home, where she attempts <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> the creases to learn what happens next.|$|E

25|$|This {{potential}} solution {{has been}} implemented by EDA in the Azores {{on the islands}} of Graciosa and Flores. This system uses an 18 megawatt-second flywheel to improve power quality and thus allow increased renewable energy usage. As the description suggests, these systems are again designed <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> transient fluctuations in supply, and could never be used to cope with an outage exceeding a couple of days.|$|E
25|$|Glaciers {{grow and}} shrink due both to natural {{variability}} and external forcings. Variability in temperature, precipitation, and englacial and subglacial hydrology can strongly determine {{the evolution of}} a glacier in a particular season. Therefore, one must average over a decadal or longer time-scale and/or over many individual glaciers <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> the local short-term variability and obtain a glacier history that is related to climate.|$|E
25|$|An anecdote {{often told}} of Zwicky {{concerns}} an informal experiment {{to see if}} he could reduce problems with turbulence hindering an observation session one night at Mount Wilson observatory. He told his assistant to fire a gun out through the telescope slit, in the hope it would help <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> the turbulence. No effect was noticed, but the event shows the kind of lateral thinking for which Zwicky was famous.|$|E

40|$|The {{electronic}} and transport properties of graphene modulated by magnetic barrier arrays are derived for finite temperature. Prominent conductance gaps, originating from quantum interference effects {{are found in}} the periodic array case. When a structural defect is inserted in the array, sharp defect modes of high conductance appear within the conductance gaps. These modes can be shifted by local doping in the defect region resulting into sensing of the chemical molecules that adhere on the graphene sheet. In general it is found that sensitivity is strongly dependent on temperature due <b>to</b> <b>smoothing</b> <b>out</b> of the defect-induced peaks and transport gaps. This temperature dependence, however, offers the added capability for sub-mK temperature sensing resolution, and thus an opportunity towards ultra-sensitive combined electrochemical-calorimetric sensing.

25|$|There are two {{varieties}} of Kennedy half {{dollars in the}} proof set issues of 1964. Initially, the die was used with accented hair, showing deeper lines than the president's widow, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, liked. New dies were prepared <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> some of the details. It is estimated that about 1 to 3% (40,000 to 100,000) of the proof halves are of the earlier type, making them somewhat more expensive for collectors.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, {{the range of}} {{available}} numbers was once again starting to run out, exacerbated by a move to biannual changes in registration letters (March and September) in 1999 <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> the bulge in registrations every August, so a new scheme needed to be adopted. It was decided to research a system that would be easier for crash or vehicle related crime witnesses to remember and clearer to read, yet still fit within a normal standard plate size.|$|E
25|$|Pumped {{water systems}} have high dispatchability, meaning {{they can come}} on-line very quickly, {{typically}} within 15 seconds, which makes these systems very efficient at soaking up variability in electrical demand from consumers. There is over 90 GW of pumped storage in operation around the world, which is about 3% of instantaneous global generation capacity. Pumped water storage systems, such as the Dinorwig storage system in Britain, hold five or six hours of generating capacity, and are used <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> demand variations.|$|E
5000|$|A single set of ring {{stations}} {{would result}} in a very intermittent flow.

25|$|Various {{efforts have}} been made to {{eliminate}} turtles to improve upon the speed of bubble sort. Cocktail sort is a bi-directional bubble sort that goes from beginning to end, and then reverses itself, going end to beginning. It can move turtles fairly well, but it retains O(n2) worst-case complexity. Comb sort compares elements separated by large gaps, and can move turtles extremely quickly before proceeding to smaller and smaller gaps <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> the list. Its average speed is comparable to faster algorithms like quicksort.|$|E
25|$|The CMU opened from Little Mill to Usk on 2 June 1856, and on 12 October 1857 it {{was opened}} {{as far as}} Monouth Troy station. Reaching Coleford, the primary object of {{building}} the line, required a crossing of the River Wye, and conversion of the Monmouth Railway. As well as relaying all of its permanent way, this would have involved considerable realignment <b>to</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> {{the worst of the}} sharp tramroad curves, and opening out the tunnel profile. However at this stage the CMU had largely exhausted its financial resources.|$|E
25|$|Co-generation {{systems can}} reach 85% {{efficiency}} (40–60% electric + remainder as thermal).
