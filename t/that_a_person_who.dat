This provision of the constitution had been ruled to be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.|$|E
25|$|The {{theological}} {{basis for}} forgiveness in Hinduism is <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> does not forgive carries a baggage of {{memories of the}} wrong, of negative feelings, of anger and unresolved emotions that affect his or her present as well as future. In Hinduism, not only should one forgive others, but one must also seek forgiveness if one has wronged someone else. Forgiveness is to be sought from the individual wronged, as well as society at large, by acts of charity, purification, fasting, rituals and meditative introspection.|$|E
25|$|Nietzsche {{may have}} {{encountered}} {{the idea of}} the Eternal Recurrence in the works of Heinrich Heine, who speculated that one day a person would be born with the same thought-processes as himself, and that the same applied to every other individual. Nietzsche expanded on this thought to form his theory, which he put forth in The Gay Science and developed in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Schopenhauer directly influenced this theory. Schopenhauer postulated <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> unconditionally affirms life would do so even if everything that has happened were to happen again repeatedly.|$|E

25|$|This United States Supreme Court case {{occurred}} over the argument of tribal water rights, {{and whether or not}} the water rights are passed along with the tribal land. When American Indian reservations would sell allotments of land to non-tribe members, those to whom the land was sold would want the same proportion of the reservation's water that the previous American Indian land owner had received. The Supreme Court upheld the earlier ruling that water rights are passed along with the land, meaning <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> purchases land from an American Indian reservation also purchases an allotment of the water source used on the reservation.|$|E

25|$|Pei Songzhi cast doubts on the Shiyu account. He {{felt that}} it was {{unlikely}} that Yu Song had to recommend Zhong Hui to Sima Shi, because Sima would most probably have already at least heard of Zhong due to the following reasons. First, Zhong Hui came from an elite family background. Second, he was already famous when he was still a youth. Third, he started serving in the Wei government as soon as he reached the age of adulthood. Pei also believed that it was impossible for anyone to be able to tell, simply by reading a piece of writing, <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> edited a few words in it is capable of shouldering greater responsibilities.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Anthony Lapalla, a {{psychologist}} at the Federal Correctional Institution in Texarkana, believed the killer was planning to continue to make unexpected attacks such as that of Virgil Starks on the outskirts of town. He also believed that the same person committed the murders of Virgil Starks, Betty Jo Booker, Paul Martin, Polly Ann Moore and Richard Griffin. He also believed the killer was between the ages of middle 30s to 50 years old. He said that the killer was apparently motivated by a strong sex drive and that he was a sadist. He said <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> would commit such crimes is intelligent, clever, shrewd and often not apprehended. According to Lapalla's theories, the killer knew at all times what was being done in the investigation and knew that the lonesome roads were being patrolled, which is why he chose the house on the farmland. He pointed out that his statements were surmised theories that were based on {{a large number of people}} who have committed similar crimes. He said in many cases the killer is never apprehended and in some instances he will divert attention to other distant communities where it is believed the crimes are committed by a different individual or else he will overcome the desire to kill and assault women.|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{nationality}} law {{has applied}} in Hong Kong since the handover on 1 July 1997. Hong Kong BDTC status {{ceased to exist}} and cannot be regained. An interpretation for implementing Chinese nationality law for Hong Kong {{was presented at the}} Nineteenth Session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress on 15 May 1996, a year prior to the Hong Kong handover and came into effect on 1 July 1997. The explanations concerning the implementation of the nationality of Hong Kong citizens is that Hong Kong citizens of Chinese descent are Chinese nationals whether or not they have acquired other foreign citizenship(s). Where such Chinese nationals resident in Hong Kong undergo a change of citizenship (e.g. in accordance with Article 9 of the Nationality Law, which provides <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> becomes settled in a foreign country and acquires foreign citizenship loses his or her Chinese citizenship - Hong Kong is not recognised as foreign territory, before or after 1 July 1997), this must be declared to immigration authorities to be recognised under Chinese nationality law. British nationality acquired in Hong Kong (including BN(O) and under the British Nationality Selection Scheme are specifically not recognised as a change of nationality (as they did not occur after the person became settled in a foreign country). Therefore, a Hong Kong resident who had acquired non-Chinese citizenship would still be recognised as a Chinese citizen after 1 July 1997 (effectively becoming a dual national), but if that person declares the change of nationality to immigration authorities, they would effectively cease to be a Chinese national.|$|E

500|$|The event CGs were {{decided by}} Nakazawa {{based on the}} game's plot and script, and written down in a {{specification}} document given to the art team. Because this was done before the scenario was completely finished, there were some places that he {{when looking at the}} scenario as a whole realized would have benefited more from a CG than some of the passages that did get one, despite how he updated the specification document every so often throughout the development. Because of this, it was decided to add more CGs to several scenes for the game's [...] "Premium Edition" [...] re-release. A challenge in creating the CGs was that the art team did not understand the game's main plot twist, resulting in several finished CGs with mistakes <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> does not know about the twist would not have noticed, that had to be fixed. For the background art, inspiration was drawn from the films Cube and The Abyss and the video game Resident Evil.|$|E
