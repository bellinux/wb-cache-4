5|$|On 22 June 1982, {{leaders of}} the three {{organizations}} formalized the formation of their coalition government by signing a Thai-sponsored agreement which established the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK). Accordingly, the CGDK’s Inner Cabinet consisted of Sihanouk as the President of Democratic Kampuchea, Khieu Samphan as the Vice-President in charge of foreign affairs and Son Sann as Prime Minister. Below the Inner Cabinet were six separate committees responsible for national defence, economy and finance, social affairs and public health, military affairs and the media. During a meeting between Kim Il-sung and Sihanouk on 10 April 1986, in Pyongyang, Kim Il-Sung had reassured Sihanouk <b>that</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> would continue to regard him as the legitimate head of state of Kampuchea. By 1987, Democratic Kampuchea still held its membership at the UN General Assembly, even though it lacked four criteria of statehood: people, territory, government and supreme authority within the borders of a country. In spite of those limitations, forces of the three armed factions within the CGDK continued to fight the Vietnamese to achieve their objective of “bring about {{the implementation of the}} International Conference on Cambodia and other relevant UN General Assembly resolutions”.|$|E

40|$|Many {{scholars}} suggest <b>that</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea’s</b> agriculture {{collapsed in}} the mid- 1990 s because {{of one of the}} three causes: overall economic decline, deficiencies of the socialist collective system, or environmental disaster. In contrast to these conventional explanations <b>that</b> view <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> as an idiosyncratic failure, this paper argues <b>that</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea’s</b> agricultural crisis is attributable to the unsustainable nature of modern industrial agriculture, rooted in the worldwide modernization project of the past two centuries. From the outset, <b>North</b> <b>Korea’s</b> agricultural production had been predicated upon a high consumption of energy, petroleum-based chemicals, mechanization, and irrigation. <b>North</b> <b>Korea’s</b> uniqueness lies not in the industrial agricultural methods used but in the extremity of their extensiveness achieved. While the North achieved a substantial agricultural success for the first three decades thanks to these practices, it paid its early success {{with the collapse of the}} 1990 s because these methods left an unsustainable level of physical and environmental externalities and because their insatiable need for inputs could no longer be met...|$|R

25|$|On September 9, 2016, a 5.3 seismic tremor was {{detected}} by seismograms in surrounding countries, after which North Korea confirmed it conducted another nuclear test. North Korea stated that this test has enabled them to confirm that its warhead can be mounted to a missile and to verify the warhead's power. It was previously doubted <b>that</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> could pair the nuclear warhead and missile together, but South Korean experts started to believe <b>that</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> can accomplish this goal {{within a few years}} after the September 9 nuclear test.|$|E
50|$|It is {{estimated}} <b>that</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea's</b> GNP nearly halved between 1990 and 1999. North Korean annual budget reports suggest state income roughly tripled between 2000 and 2014. By about 2010 external trade {{had returned to}} 1990 levels.|$|R
25|$|In early 2004 former Los Alamos National Laboratory {{director}} Siegfried S.

She also noted there were no signs of obesity in the country, which is a newly emerging problem in other parts of Asia. Chan's comments marked a significant departure from that of her predecessor, Gro Harlem Brundtland, who said in 2001 <b>that</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea's</b> health system was near collapse. The director-general's assessment was criticised, including in a Wall Street Journal editorial which called her statements [...] "surreal."
