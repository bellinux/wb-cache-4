5|$|Throughout all this, Lody's {{demeanour}} {{was relatively}} calm {{after the initial}} shock. Cheeseman observed that Lody only appeared uneasy when his notebook was being examined; the inspector later commented that Lody was not the usual class of man he was accustomed to dealing with, but {{admitted that he had}} never met a man under precisely similar circumstances. Cheeseman had been educated in Germany, knew the language and felt able to recognise a German accent; he noticed that Lody's American accent slipped from time to time, presumably due to stress, and became convinced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> German.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{official}} had {{stated that}} by 2002, interrogators had heard uncorroborated claims about an al-Qaeda courier with the kunya Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti (sometimes {{referred to as}} Sheikh Abu Ahmed from Kuwait). One of those claims came from Mohammed al-Qahtani, a detainee interrogated for 48 days more or less continuously between November 23, 2002, and January 11, 2003. At some point during this period, al-Qahtani told interrogators about a man known as Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti {{who was part of}} the inner circle of al-Qaeda. Later in 2003, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged operational chief of al-Qaeda, stated that he was acquainted with al-Kuwaiti, but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> not active in al-Qaeda, according to a U.S. official.|$|E
5|$|The {{police had}} only two clues: some {{footprints}} in the garden, and a hat that they found in a nearby gutter. The police took moulds of the footprints and endeavored to trace the hat, but with no success. However, during routine questioning of local residents, police learned that earlier in {{the afternoon of the}} murder, a man had been seen sitting with a heavily-pregnant young woman on a bench at one end of South Cliff Avenue; the man had also been seen wandering the street while the young woman sat on the bench alone, leading police to suspect <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> assessing the lay of the land.|$|E

5|$|Twenty {{minutes into}} the game, a pass to the right wing by George Livingstone eluded Bolton's Archie Freebairn, and reached Meredith, who dribbled beyond Bob Struthers for a run on goal. He shot to goalkeeper Davies' left, scoring the opening goal. Reporters with Bolton sympathies, such as ex-Bolton {{secretary}} JJ Bentley, claimed the goal to be offside, though the Bolton players made no appeal to the referee. The goal led to one over-exuberant Manchester City supporter invading the pitch, and subsequently being escorted away by police, though {{in contrast to the}} modern image of the football hooligan, the Sporting Chronicle reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> then allowed back onto the terraces, as the police had been impressed by the level of devotion that he had demonstrated.|$|E

25|$|Former South Australian Chief Superintendent Len Brown, {{who worked}} on the case in the 1940s, stated that he {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> from a country in the Warsaw Pact, which led to the police's inability to confirm the man's identity.|$|E

25|$|Initially, it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> an illegal immigrant from Bangladesh. There had been calls from local organisations to expel outsiders. The incident was also attributed to the faulty justice system of the state, which had obtained few convictions in various cases of rape. The man's local accomplice who was lodged in same jail was left alone by the mob.|$|E
25|$|Both SHAC and Animal Liberation Front {{activists have}} engaged in {{harassment}} and intimidation, including issuing hoax bomb threats and death threats.

25|$|On September 30, 2012, a 19-year-old man {{fell from}} the Venom Drop water slide. According to a {{spokesperson}} for the water park, the man cut in line at the slide, fought through the lifeguards, and jumped onto the slide head-first. The man tumbled onto the slide and slipped over the edge, falling 60 feet onto a fence below the slide tower. The local sheriff's office reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> transported to an area hospital with life-threatening injuries.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Battuta often {{experienced}} {{culture shock}} in regions he visited where the local customs of recently converted peoples {{did not fit}} in with his orthodox Muslim background. Among the Turks and Mongols, he was astonished at the freedom and respect enjoyed by women and remarked that on seeing a Turkish couple in a bazaar one might assume <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> the woman's servant {{when he was in}} fact her husband. He also felt that dress customs in the Maldives, and some sub-Saharan regions in Africa were too revealing.|$|E
25|$|Another synagogue was {{established}} in the 16th century and named after Elijah the Prophet. This synagogue is the oldest of the four. The Eliyahu Ha'navi Synagogue mainly served as a beth midrash for Torah study. Also known as Kahal Talmud Torah, it was only used for prayer on festivals. According to legend, the name of the synagogue was given after an event that took place on Yom Kippur, when one person was missing to complete the minyan required for prayer. Out of the blue, a man, unknown to the worshippers, appeared and the service was able to start. The man mysteriously disappeared after the Neilah prayer. The people were sure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> none other than Elijah the Prophet.|$|E

25|$|Now it {{happened}} that on a cold and wintry day, as Lillinonah was out walking in the woods high above the swift rapids of the Housatonic, she came upon a handsome young white man wandering aimlessly through the forest, stumbling occasionally and falling to his knees before rising once more and continuing on. It was obvious to the Indian maiden <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> sick with cold and fever, weak of body and confused of mind. With pity in her heart for the suffering stranger, she offered to assist {{him back to the}} village of the Pootatucks, where he might find rest and treatment for his illness. When the white man nodded his assent, she slowly walked him to her home, though he had to lean heavily upon her for support, lest he collapse in the effort.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} casamento poveiro (Povoan marriage), {{in which}} the newly-wed couple was covered by a fisherman's net and watered with vinho verde {{in order to bring}} fortune to the marriage, is becoming a forgotten practice. In Póvoa's tradition (that persists to the present day), the heir of the family is the youngest son (as in old Brittany and Denmark). The younger son is the heir because it was expected that he would take care of his parents when they became old. Also, unlike the rest of the nation, it is the woman who governs and leads the family – this matriarchy is derived from the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> usually fishing at sea. The Danish professor Heningser noticed that several features in the Povoan fishermen cultural life were similar to those found in the Jutland fjords, one of which, the women's sign of mourning, putting the skirt on the shoulders and throw the head, was found only in Northern Denmark and Póvoa de Varzim.|$|E
25|$|A second {{statutory}} declaration was filed on 1 July 2008 by Abdul Razak Baginda's private investigator P Balasubramaniam, disclosing then deputy Prime Minister Najib's links and Altantuya. Bala said the police omitted {{information about the}} relationship between Najib and Altantuya during their investigation. In the {{statutory declaration}} Abdul Razak had told Balasubramaniam that the deputy prime minister had a sexual relationship with Altantuya and that the trio had dined together in Paris. Detailed conversations in a statutory declaration revealed which Abdul Razak was in effect inherited Altantuya as a lover from Najib, who passed her on because he didn’t want to be harassed as deputy prime minister. Among other lurid details, Balasubramaniam described text messages between Najib and Abdul Razak in which the latter was asking for help to avoid arrest, implying Najib personally interfered with the murder investigation. In making his statutory declaration, Balasubramaniam mentioned that a man in a blue Proton Saga happened to be driving pass the home of defence analyst Abdul Razak Baginda at that time of the day before Altantuya was reported missing on 19 October 2006 and revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> Nasir Safar, the special advisor to Najib Abdul Razak.|$|E

50|$|A {{poor man}} has twelve children, and works just {{hard enough to}} feed each of them every day. When his thirteenth and last child <b>is</b> born, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> decides to find a godfather for this child. He runs out into the highway, and finds God walking on the highway. God asks to be the godfather, {{promising}} the child health and happiness. <b>The</b> <b>man,</b> after finding out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> God, declines, saying that God condones poverty. Then <b>the</b> <b>man</b> meets <b>the</b> Devil on the highway. The Devil asks to be the godfather, offering the child gold and the world's joys. <b>The</b> <b>man,</b> after finding out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Devil, declines, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Devil deceives mankind.|$|R
25|$|The grave {{was named}} after this inscription. Scholarship assumes that Aline is the woman buried in the tomb and {{equipped}} with a mummy portrait. Further, it is believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> her husband and the girls her daughters. As the ages and sexes of the undecorated mummies are not known, they cannot be similarly attributed. The separation of the date in the inscription in two parts, resulting from the insertion of Aline's age in the middle, is unusual. Since it was common in Roman Egypt to count the year from the accession of the current ruler, the grave can be dated, {{in conjunction with the}} portrait's hairstyle, quite securely to one of two possible dates. It is usually taken to be from the tenth year of the reign of Tiberius, i.e. 24 AD. The same hairstyle became popular once more a century later, so that the 10th year of Hadrian's reign (AD 107) is also a possibility, but most scholars prefer the earlier date. Further arguments in favour of the later date include the fine painting style and use of hatching, both typical of the 2nd century AD, the lilac tones of the garments, the depiction of the woman as rather well-fed, as well as the hair and beard of the man. It remains unclear when the mummies were deposited and whether all died within the same generation.|$|E
25|$|Meinhof {{had been}} {{approached}} by Gudrun Ensslin, girlfriend of jailed arsonist Andreas Baader, for her help in securing the release of Baader from police custody. A scheme was developed where Meinhof would approach leftist publisher Klaus Wagenbach, seeking to have him hire Meinhof and the imprisoned Baader in writing a book. After securing a contract from Wagenbach (who {{was not aware of}} Meinhof's ulterior motives), Meinhof petitioned authorities to allow Baader to travel from Moabit Prison to an institute for social research in the Dahlem district of Berlin. The plan was for armed guerrillas to enter the institute and secure the release of Baader; it was intended that no shooting was to take place. Meinhof was to stay behind, and have a plausibly deniable explanation that she was not involved in the planning of Baader's escape. Baader arrived with two guards, and set to work with Meinhof in the institute's library. Two women compatriots of Ensslin's, along with a man with a criminal record (hired because of his supposed experience with armed encounters) broke into the institute. The man shot the elderly librarian Georg Linke, severely wounding him in his liver. It was later claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> holding two weapons, a pistol and a gas canister gun, and accidentally fired the wrong weapon in the confusion.|$|E
