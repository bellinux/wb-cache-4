5|$|Elizabeth {{was held}} in the YMCA for nearly 200days, during which time the Kempeitai meticulously {{followed}} up every point in her story, cross-examining people she said she had helped. After a huge dossier of interviews had been compiled, the Japanese concluded that she was <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> set her free. Khun Heng, however, was sentenced to 12years in Outram Road Prison. People avoided Elizabeth following her release, too terrified to speak to her. Fifteen internees died in the Kempeitais cells during the Double Tenth inquisition. The suffering spread to the entire civilian population of Changi Prison; rations were cut, and games, concerts, plays, and school lessons were forbidden for months.|$|E
5|$|In Bhattikavya, Jatayu dies in {{the arms}} of Rama without {{revealing}} that Sita is in the clutches of Ravana. After his arms are chopped, the unnamed demon – identified with Kabandha – falls and starts his counsel. The funeral pyre scene is dropped here. The demon tells Rama that Ravana abducted Sita and has taken her to Lanka. He advises Rama to form an alliance with Sugriva, without which Ravana will not be overcome. He instructs Rama to negotiate a deal with Sugriva as per which Rama will kill Vali and end Sugriva's sorrows and in return, Sugriva would mobilize his forces to defeat Ravana. The demon praises Rama, who purified the demon by his sword. The demon urges Rama to believe him as he is telling the truth. At last, the demon transforms into a radiant divine being as he was <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> plunges into the sky.|$|E
5|$|No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel is an {{autobiography}} by fashion model, photographer, author and talent agent Janice Dickinson. It {{was published in}} hardcover format in 2002 by ReganBooks, an imprint of HarperCollins. The author's friend make-up artist Way Bandy advised her to begin putting her past experiences down on paper {{as a form of}} therapy from prior trauma in her life. After gaining sobriety, she started compiling her notes into book format. She contacted book publisher Judith Regan who agreed to help her publish her book after hearing her tale on the phone, without first seeing a writing sample. In November 2014, Dickinson asserted in an interview with Entertainment Tonight that pressure from Bill Cosby and his lawyers resulted in the removal of an account of sexual assault and rape by Cosby when she visited him at a hotel in Lake Tahoe, California in 1982. After Cosby's attorney disputed this account, she reappeared on the program to proclaim she was <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> explained she was speaking out publicly because of a need to be heard and to represent other women who stated they experienced a similar trauma.|$|E

25|$|Pete {{enjoys a}} simple life, but his old-fashioned views about masculinity cause rifts {{between him and}} Ian. Pete is thrilled when his other son Simon appears in Walford, which {{excludes}} Ian further. Pete grows attached to Simon, but Pat's disclosure in 1986 that Pete is not Simon's father threatens to ruin their relationship. Lou attempts to persuade Pete that Pat is lying, all the while believing that she is actually <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> that Kenny is Simon's father. When Pauline discovers this, she informs Pete, leading to numerous confrontations between him and Pat. When Pat is assaulted in 1987, Pete becomes prime suspect and is interrogated.

25|$|Ronnie has {{a tumultuous}} {{relationship}} with employee, Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace), eventually leading to Danielle being sacked and Ronnie publicly berating her. Danielle is devastated, and is later seen clutching a locket containing {{a photograph of}} Ronnie, revealing herself to be Ronnie's daughter. It transpires that Danielle {{is the result of}} a teenage romance between Ronnie and her first boyfriend, Joel Reynolds (Cavan Clerkin). Archie disapproved of the pregnancy and put Danielle—named Amy by Ronnie—up for adoption. Danielle was adopted by Lizzie and Andy Jones (Aneirin Hughes), and is now trying to locate her birth mother. On Archie and Peggy's wedding day, Danielle tells Ronnie that she is her daughter. Ronnie does not believe her because Archie told her that her daughter is dead, and throws her out. She later realises that Danielle was <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> tries to apologise to Danielle but she is hit by Janine Butcher's (Charlie Brooks) car and dies in Ronnie's arms. Danielle's adoptive father, Andy, comes to London to get her and takes Danielle's remains back to Telford and bans Ronnie from the funeral. Despite this, Ronnie goes to Telford and Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) convinces Andy to talk to Ronnie about Danielle. Grieving for the daughter she was not allowed to raise, Ronnie becomes obsessed with having a baby. She tries tricking Jack into getting her pregnant and rekindles her romance with Joel until she learns that he has had a vasectomy so Ronnie ends their relationship. She gets pregnant by Owen Turner (Lee Ross), but miscarries when Archie pushes her into the bar during an argument. Archie is later murdered and Ronnie is arrested as a suspect but released without charge. When Roxy accuses Ronnie of murdering their father, Ronnie reveals that Archie raped Stacey, and did the same to her when she was 13.

500|$|In {{a parody}} of Dead Calm, Homer and Marge set sail on a romantic second honeymoon. Their time {{together}} is interrupted when they rescue a castaway. Introducing himself as Roger, the castaway explains {{that he was a}} chef on a yacht called the Albatross, and was knocked out after attempting to stop a poisoning on his ship. Roger makes them a pie, but Homer becomes convinced that Roger poisoned the guests on the Albatross. He grabs the pie from Marge and throws it out the window. Marge chastises Homer, but looks out a window and sees a dead shark with the pie pan in its mouth. Homer and Marge take {{matters into their own hands}} as they seemingly kill Roger using a metal pole, and knock his body overboard. However, finding the Albatross, they realize Roger was <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> that some of the passengers are still alive, as one of the people administered an antidote. Roger appears and explains that the shark they saw had died from a fuel leakage from Homer and Marge's boat. Homer then kills Roger, the surviving Albatross crew, and a pelican, to cover their tracks. However, unable to bear the guilt, Marge eats the poisoned pie, much to Homer's horror. The story is then revealed to be Maggie's imagination while she is taking a bath. Homer asks Marge what Maggie thinks about while bathing, which she responds, [...] "Just sugar plums and buttercups." [...] Maggie then shadily moves her eyes (revealing eyeliner over one eye), puts on a hat, and drinks milk like Alex from A Clockwork Orange as the theme from the movie briefly plays in the background.|$|E
500|$|Euston {{was in fact}} {{still in}} England and {{immediately}} filed a case against Parke for libel. At the trial, Euston admitted that when walking along Piccadilly a tout {{had given him a}} card which read [...] "Poses plastiques. C. Hammond, 19 Cleveland Street". Euston testified that he went to the house believing Poses plastiques meant a display of female nudes. He paid a sovereign to get in but upon entering Euston said he was appalled to discover the [...] "improper" [...] nature of the place and immediately left. The defence witnesses contradicted each other, and could not describe Euston accurately. The final defence witness, John Saul, was a male prostitute who had earlier been involved in a homosexual scandal at Dublin Castle, and featured in a clandestinely published erotic novel The Sins of the Cities of the Plain which was cast as his autobiography. Delivering his testimony in a manner described as [...] "brazen effrontery", Saul admitted to earning his living by leading an [...] "immoral life" [...] and [...] "practising criminality", and detailed his alleged sexual encounters with Euston at the house. The defence did not call either Newlove or Veck as witnesses, and could not produce any evidence that Euston had left the country. On 16 January 1890, the jury found Parke guilty and the judge sentenced him to twelve months in prison. One historian considers Euston was <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> only visited Cleveland Street once because he was misled by the card. However, another has alleged Euston was a well-known figure in the homosexual underworld, and was extorted so often by the notorious blackmailer Robert Cliburn, that Oscar Wilde had quipped Cliburn deserved the Victoria Cross for his tenacity. Saul stated that he told the police his story in August, which provoked the judge to enquire rhetorically why the authorities had not taken action.|$|E
