5|$|There is no {{conclusive}} evidence explaining why the Dibbles chose to place Gothic {{windows on the}} upper level. The windows {{are believed to have}} been purchased through the Sears catalog. There are two commonly accepted theories: the Dibbles may have wanted <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> beautify their home at a time when rural life in Iowa was a struggle, or they could have been following a trend in which extravagant details were desirable in residences in the late nineteenth century, and the Dibbles chose windows whose costs would have been relatively reasonable at the time.|$|E
5|$|By 6:30am {{the fire}} was {{spreading}} very quickly through the building, although from the outside nothing was visible. Because of the wooden construction, the building was soon engulfed in flames. The guests on the top level could not escape and stood panicked in the windows. When the fire reached the rooms of some guests, they leaped out of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> escape. At 6:42 the first large fire engine arrived. On the street there lay several dead and injured people, who had jumped from their hotel room windows. On the lower floor, the furniture store Inden was also on fire. The fire fighters tried to fold out a life net in the Papenbroekssteeg (which runs between the Rokin and the Kalverstraat) but the alley was too narrow for it.|$|E
5|$|On August 16, 2008, {{construction}} crews {{made the}} last major concrete pour to top off the Trump tower's concrete core, which was commemorated with an unofficial ceremony. To celebrate the milestone, a yellow tower crane raised a bucket full of concrete and an American flag to the rooftop of the skyscraper. Another ceremony occurred on August 19, when construction supervisors, structural engineers and company representatives from McHugh Construction made a minor concrete pour {{at the top of}} the Trump tower. Though Donald Trump was absent from both of these ceremonies, he, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump attended the topping off party on September 24, 2008. Original plans called for <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> be completed and the spire erected in October 2008. However, the spire installation was delayed through high winds in December 2008, and was finally completed on January 3, 2009. Kamin's critical opinion is that the spire is not aesthetically complementary.|$|E

5|$|Sutton Court {{is built}} of squared and coursed {{sandstone}} rubble throughout with freestone and ashlar dressings, copings, slate roofs. The north front comprises a central three-storey fourteenth century pele tower with a taller circular stair turret and two-storey ranges linking {{it to the}} 1558 'Bess of Hardwick Building' {{to the left and}} a four bay 1858–1860 servants' wing of three storeys to the right. Windows to the pele tower and right-hand linking range are 15th century, of two cusped lights with hood moulds, some of which have been renewed, and some relocated from other areas. The doorway to the tower dates from 1858–60. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> the left-hand linking range and the 'Hardwick Building' are four and six lights, with chamfered mullions. The two-storey 'Hardwick' range has diagonal offset buttresses. There are eighteenth-century battlements to the pele tower, with tall octagonal ashlar stacks.|$|E

Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), as office administrator, threatens to move everyone to a different building if nothing is done. She leaves and comes back with pictures of a newer office space and says they can move in three months. Dwight investigates and finds that the office building does not exist. When Dwight plays coy around Pam, she admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that she lied about the office building and that she is afraid of failing again after failing {{as an artist and}} a salesperson. Jim tries in vain to reassure her, and she breaks down in tears. Later Nate (Mark Proksch), Dwight's building assistant, discreetly gives Pam a book on the state building regulations. Pam shows Dwight that his policies are in violation of the laws written in the book, so Dwight puts everything back to normal. The camera crew confronts Dwight with footage showing that he overheard Pam's conversation with Jim and instructed Nate to give her the book on the building regulations. Dwight admits that he allowed her to win, but mocks the idea that he did so out of compassion.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} entry of the franchise, {{made up of}} four {{segments}} from a presumably failed television series, Belle teaches the Beast {{a thing or two}} about life itself, consideration and manners. He appears only in the first and fourth segments, and in a cameo in the third. In the first part, The Perfect Word, Beast and Belle have a bitter falling out at dinner when the Beast demands that Cogsworth open <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> cool him down, despite the fact that he is the only one hot and there is a cold wind, and angrily strikes his servant, Webster, a long-tongued dictionary. Despite Lumiere and Cogsworth's pleas, Beast refuses to apologise for his behaviour, until Webster, Crane and LePlume forge a letter of apology from the Beast to Belle. All is settled, until the Beast realises that it was a forgery. He furiously banishes Webster, Crane and LePlume from the castle, but Belle brings them back from the woods, and the Beast soon learns to forgive them, as their intentions were good.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} is plastered and painted blue, encircled granite base and sections defined by pilasters where iron structures that support that roof are affixed, lined with wooden lathes painted in blue. The main doorways {{are in the}} east, north and west preceded by three ample stairs with iron guardrail and ceramic flooring. In {{the centre of the}} building is the primitive buvette thermal spring recessed into an octagonal plan with similar pavement, and protected by iron grate, painted green (with faceted basins on angles). The fountain is protected by a cylindrical bell-shaped structure. Around the building is a raised wing, accessed by an intermediary landing of stairs, with black and white ceramic floors and iron guard painted green, decorated by stylized voluptuous motifs. These structures also integrate lamps on their angles into the high columns, with globe of lighting surrounded by several stylized arms (the globe lighting repeated from the ceiling). A gutter runs along the lowest part of the interior with drains in the corners. A centralized apparatus opens the six central rotary panels; by using a vertical iron rod, moved by a lever, allows <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> be opened simultaneously. The rooftop is a grid of horizontal rods with bearings that run north to south supporting the weight of the structure.|$|E

25|$|Unlike earlier {{waterfront}} strikes, longshoremen were {{prevented from}} picketing the docks to discourage strikebreaking, {{and claimed that}} they were going to go en masse to talk to the non-union workers. They were led by Victoria Cross recipient Mickey O'Rourke and a contingent of First World War veterans and marched behind a Union Jack flag, to great symbolic effect. At the entrance to the pier, they were met by Chief Constable Colonel W. W. Foster, who warned the demonstrators that they would not be permitted to proceed. When they refused to turn back, protesters were attacked with clubs by the police guarding the pier. Within minutes, more police joined in the fight. In addition to the Vancouver city police, contingents from the British Columbia Provincial Police, who had been hiding behind boxcars, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, engaged with demonstrators. The police chased the dispersing crowd, continuing to club people even as they fled and fired tear gas. Many protesters fought back, throwing rocks and other projectiles at the police, while others that were attacked were simply trying to flee the scene. The ensuing melee continued for three hours and spread throughout the nearby residential district. Several people, both police and protesters, were hospitalized as a result of the riot, and one bystander was shot in the back of his legs by a police shotgun. Offices of Communist organizers and the longshoremen's union were also raided, with tear gas shot through <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> drive out any occupants before the police entered. Strike supporters set up a makeshift hospital at the Ukrainian Hall, and the police did the same for their wounded at the Coroner's Court on Cordova Street. In total, 28 out of the 60 injured were hospitalized and 24 men were arrested. Mayor Gerry McGeer declared that striking longshoremen would no longer be eligible for relief payments for themselves or their families.|$|E

500|$|Filming was {{conducted}} in and around Slough, Buckinghamshire and Maidenhead, Berkshire over five weeks between May and June 1960. The Slough location shooting made use of [...] the AP Films Studio itself (doubling as the gang's warehouse), a café {{on the other side}} of the road (as the main hideout), the woods of Burnham Beeches and various points along the A4 road. Halliford Studios in Shepperton, Surrey was also used briefly for filming.

500|$|Campbell had {{to sleep}} wearing his make-up. Because of several scenes that {{required}} to be shot in both {{the day and the}} night, it was considered easiest to have Campbell sleep all night wearing his make-up, since removing it was too complicated. When Campbell eventually had the effect removed, he was alarmed to notice that his face had actually [...] "changed shape" [...] because of how long the make-up had been applied, though it returned to normal after an extended amount of time. This serves as one of several moments where the film-makers had to be creative to make the film considering the low budget. Other examples include blacking out <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> make scenes darker and shooting all night long to make the filming schedule. Raimi had to get increasingly inventive during production, often coming up with [...] "bizarre" [...] ideas while shooting scenes. This led to him experimenting with camera moves and camera speeds, [...] "taking it a little further than we had gone before, recording synch-sound at a third slower for a more monstrous effect.|$|E
500|$|Incorporating {{a window}} and two light {{openings}} for the bell, the tower and its spire have been dated to the mid-14th century, although its pinnacles were replaced in 1887. The antiquarian Edward Trollope {{did not like the}} spire's design, saying that it [...] "looks as if it had slipped down". Built in a Decorated Gothic style, the tower joins to the nave with a triple-chamferred arch. The nave has been heavily restored and contains elements from a range of periods. The architectural historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner refers to the south wall as [...] "puzzling" [...] because of the tracery—it is unclear what is [...] "Victorian fancy" [...] and what is [...] "correct restoration". The wall itself is 14th-century (Pevsner suggests about 1300) and incorporates a priest's doorway with mouldings, capitals and a bust of a man; <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> its east have been restored, but follow a 14th-century reticulated style, although unusually they feature hexagons with pointed trefoils: [...] "the oddest patterns", as Pevsner puts it. The north aisle is from the 13th century, although a 12th-century doorway sits between its late-14th-century windows. At the eastern end of the nave is the chancel, which has a polygonal (quinquangular) apse and was constructed between 1862 and 1863 by Charles Kirk the Younger in memory of his parents, the elder Charles Kirk and his wife Elizabeth. Its windows were made by Ward and Hughes.|$|E
500|$|In his classification, Sharpe first {{identified}} two main classes, {{according to whether}} the arches were [...] "circular" [...] or [...] "pointed". [...] The class characterised by the circular arch was the Romanesque class; that by the pointed arch was the Gothic. [...] He divided the Romanesque class into two periods by date rather than by stylistic differences, the dividing date being 1066; this divided the [...] "Saxon" [...] from the [...] "Norman" [...] stage. Whereas Rickman allowed pointed arches when they occurred {{in the same building}} as round arches in his Norman period, Sharpe separated buildings that contained both types of arches into a separate intermediate style, the [...] "Transitional". When it came to the Gothic class, Sharpe identified four styles, in contrast to Rickman's three, using <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> differentiate between them. [...] The earliest style was characterised by windows resembling a lancet [...] "in its length, breadth, and principal proportions". [...] These windows might be single, or in groups of two, three, five, or seven. [...] This style he termed the [...] "Lancet Period". During the next period, tracery appeared in the windows, and originally consisted of simple geometric forms, in particular the circle. [...] This period he called the [...] "Geometrical Period". Later the tracery became more complex, including the ogee curve; the characteristic feature being the [...] "sinuosity of form" [...] in the windows and elsewhere. [...] This Sharpe termed the [...] "Curvilinear Period". Finally, the transom appeared in the windows, and the curved line in the tracery became replaced by straight lines, an [...] "angularity of form", and a [...] "square edge was preferred". [...] This style he named the [...] "Rectilinear Period". The approximate dates Sharpe gave for his periods were, following 1066, the Norman Period up to 1145, the Transitional Period to 1190, the Lancet Period to 1245, the Geometrical Period to 1315, the Curvilinear Period to 1360, and the Rectilinear Period to 1550.|$|E
