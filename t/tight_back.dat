40|$|The {{practice}} of <b>tight</b> <b>backing</b> adhesive bound, hard cover books {{has long been}} thought to enhance durability {{at the expense of}} openability. <b>Tight</b> <b>backing</b> is popular in a number of specialized binding markets, the most notable of which is textbook production. Yet despite their prevalence, {{there is a lack of}} information available about how the openability and durability characteristics of <b>tight</b> <b>backed</b> books are affected by variable factors in the production process. The purpose of this study was to evaluate three variables involved in the production of <b>tight</b> <b>backed,</b> adhesive bound, hardcover volumes. The three factors considered were bulk of the book block, surface area of adhesive application to the spine and paper stock. Analyses of durability was conducted using two pieces of testing apparatus, the Octagonal Tumbling Drum and the Universal Book Tester. Openability was measured using the Photocopy Openability Test. The statistical design utilized a blocked and replicated three way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), conducted at the 0. 05 alpha level. Where the data led to the rejection of the null hypothesis, a Duncan Multiple Range Test was employed to isolate the source of the variation. The procedures determined that bulk had no effect on openability, but became a factor in durability when the book was subjected to severe abuse. Paper stock was deemed to have no significant effect on either durability or openability. With regard to adhesive treatment, an inverted relationship was found to exist between durability and openability. As adhesive coating increased in surface area, durability was enhanced at the expense of openability. This was found to be a non-linear relationship. Finally, it was found that if the proper materials and construction techniques were employed in book production, then bindings with high durability could be created despite effects of other variable factors...|$|R

Her dark eyebrows were very finely drawn above her large, dark-grey, pellucid eyes, but they were drawn with a {{peculiar}} obstinate and irritating lift. Her nose was straight and small, her mouth well-shut. And her big, rather hostile eyes had a withheld look in them, obstinate. Yet, being newly wed and probably newly-awakened, her eyes looked sometimes at me with a provoking look, curious as to what I was in the husband line, challenging rather defiantly with her new secrets, obstinate in opposition to the male authority, and yet intrigued by the very fact that one was man. The velveteen husband--his velveteens too had gone soft and gold-faded, yet somehow they made him look ugly, common--he watched her with his irritable, yellow-brown eyes, and seemed to fume in his stiff beard.|$|E

His crimes usually take place during the darker winter months. He targets lone women who have just returned to their cars, abducting them at knifepoint before forcing them to drive to secluded areas in the south of the city where he then attacks them. He removes their underwear but then makes them put their <b>tights</b> <b>back</b> on which he rips during the rape. When he found one victim was not wearing tights, he ordered her to put on a pair he had brought with him.

Carey and her team controlled the bulk of the game, emerging victorious with a 7-5 win, with Carey shooting a blistering 96% in the game. This vaulted Carey and Team Alberta into the final where they faced Northern Ontario's Krista McCarville. It was a <b>tight,</b> <b>back</b> and forth game tied 6-6 in the 10th end. Ultimately it came down to Carey's final stone, which she used to draw the back 4 foot for a single point sealing a 7-6 victory to claim the national title.

With the win, Arizona advanced to the Conference Championship to play the Chicago Rush. Chicago {{was one of only}} two teams to defeat the Rattlers in the regular season, thanks to a game-winning field goal by Chris Gould. In a tightly contested 54-48 shootout, the Snakes squeaked by the Rush, to earn Davila his very first ArenaBowl berth. Arizona would face the American Conference Champion Jacksonville Sharks led by veteran quarterback Aaron Garcia. In another <b>tight</b> <b>back</b> and forth contest, the two teams posted one of the best performances in ArenaBowl history. It appeared as though the Rattlers had scored the game-winning touchdown after Nick hit Kerry Reed with a 12-yard reception with 21 seconds left in the game. However, on 4th down Garcia countered, throwing the game-winning touchdown pass to Jeron Harvey as time expired and stunning the Rattlers.

40|$|Title: The {{efficacy}} of botulinum toxin in treating musculoskeletal back pain and dysfunction. Clinical Bottom Line: At this point {{there is still}} limited research on the {{efficacy of}} botulinum toxin (BTX) for back pain. Our research found 2 articles examining generalized low back pain which provided convincing evidence for the efficacy of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) in reducing pain and disability. In other subgroups of low back pain, the {{evidence in support of}} BTX effectiveness was less substantial. There were 2 articles that provided little evidence for the efficacy of BTX-A for myofascial pain syndrome, and there were 4 articles that provided moderate evidence for either BTX-A or BTX-B in treating piriformis syndrome. Of these, two articles show compounding effects of combining BTX injections with physical therapy intervention. Lastly, two articles were examined that showed little evidence for the efficacy of BTX-A in treating patients with chronic neck pain. Overall it appeared that there is potential for BTX to be beneficial to patients with chronic back pain in decreasing pain, especially {{for those who do not}} respond to more conservative approaches. We would like to see more long term follow up studies to determine if the decreases in pain and disability are continued after the effects of BTX have elapsed. Additionally, we would like to see more studies that examine if physical therapy, in conjunction with BTX injections, prolongs or enhances the treatment effect. Clinical Scenario: A patient with chronic LBP due to several MVAs approached us in the clinic and asked about the effectiveness of botulinum toxin to relieve his back pain. The patient has had extensive imagining done, and he has had disk herniation and nerve root impingement ruled out. This patient has been through several attempts at physical therapy, cortisone injections into multiple facet joints, and trigger point injections with lidocaine into the paraspinal musculature, all without relief. The patient’s physiatrist has now recommended that he undergo a botulinum toxin injection to relieve <b>tight</b> <b>back</b> musculature and decrease pain. Our clinically answerable question: Population: The population that we are focusing on is patients with musculoskeletal pain attributed to: low back pain, piriformis syndrome, myofascial pain or chronic neck pain. Intervention: We wish to determine the efficacy of botulinum toxin for musculoskeletal pain in the back. Comparison: Our comparison group is a control group who will receive saline injections or steroid injections. Outcome: We wish to measure outcomes by decreased score on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and/or increased scores on functional outcome measures...|$|E

He was said to excel at taking the team over the treacherous road, which included many sharp drop offs {{at the side of}} the road and numerous <b>tight</b> switch <b>backs.</b> He never had an accident that cost the company money nor injury to his passengers. It is thought that an accident precipitated his own death at the age of 42. According to one account, he was riding as a passenger in the stage when a horse got away from the driver, and George clambered to the front horse to stop the team, in the course of which he injured himself. A few days later, after complaining of feeling ill, he died at his parents ranch. He was their only child.|$|R

It attaches from a lower ring on the surcingle, through the bit ring, and back up to an upper ring on the surcingle. This allows the horse to stretch down and lower his head while still maintaining contact with the bit, and are therefore useful on horses that are <b>tight</b> in the <b>back,</b> carry their head too high, or are learning to stretch forward and down for the bit contact.|$|R
