50|$|Stack {{pointers}} may {{point to}} the origin of a stack or to a limited range of addresses either above or below the origin (depending on {{the direction in which}} <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> grows); however, <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> pointer cannot cross the origin of <b>the</b> <b>stack.</b> In other words, if the origin of <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> is at address 1000 and <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> grows downwards (towards addresses 999, 998, and so on), <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> pointer must never be incremented beyond 1000 (to 1001, 1002, etc.). If a pop operation on <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> causes <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> pointer to move past the origin of <b>the</b> <b>stack,</b> a stack underflow occurs. If a push operation causes <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> pointer to increment or decrement beyond the maximum extent of <b>the</b> <b>stack,</b> a stack overflow occurs.|$|R
50|$|Pushing an item on to <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> adjusts <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> pointer by <b>the</b> size of {{the item}} (either decrementing or incrementing, {{depending}} on {{the direction in which}} <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> grows in memory), pointing it to the next cell, and copies the new top item to <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> area. Depending again on the exact implementation, {{at the end of a}} push operation, <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> pointer may point to the next unused location in <b>the</b> <b>stack,</b> or it may point to the topmost item in <b>the</b> <b>stack.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> points to <b>the</b> current topmost item, <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> pointer will be updated before a new item is pushed onto the stack; if it points to the next available location in <b>the</b> <b>stack,</b> it will be updated after the new item is pushed onto <b>the</b> <b>stack.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stacks</b> {{belonged to}} Monet's farmer-neighbour, Monsieur Quéruel. Noticing {{the way the}} light changed on M. Quéruel's stacks, Monet asked his stepdaughter, Blanche Hoschedé, to bring him two canvases, one for sunny and one for {{overcast}} conditions. But Monet soon found he could not catch the ever-changing light and mood on merely two canvases: as a result, his willing helper was quickly bringing as many canvases as her wheelbarrow could hold. Monet's daily routine therefore came to involve carting paints, easels and many unfinished canvases back and forth, working on whichever canvas most closely resembled {{the scene of the}} moment as the conditions and light fluctuated. Although he began painting <b>the</b> <b>stacks</b> en plein air, Monet later revised his initial impressions in his studio, both to generate contrast and to preserve the harmony within the series.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though their}} most recent single was doing poorly, Deep Purple {{maintained}} {{a reputation as a}} fine live act in the US. The band had now begun to develop their stage presence into something grander, going in a louder and heavier direction and focusing more and more on the instrumental interplay between Blackmore and Lord. In particular the latter had found a way to short-circuit the original Leslie speakers of his Hammond organ C-3 and connect the instrument directly into <b>the</b> <b>stacks</b> of Marshall amps, obtaining a roaring sound and matching the guitar in loudness.|$|E
5|$|Haystacks is {{the common}} English title {{for a series of}} impressionist {{paintings}} by Claude Monet. The principle subject of each painting in the series is stacks of harvested wheat (or possibly barley or oats: the original French title, Les Meules à Giverny, simply means <b>The</b> <b>Stacks</b> at Giverny). The title refers primarily to a twenty-five canvas series (Wildenstein Index Numbers 1266-1290) which Monet began {{near the end of the}} summer of 1890 and continued through the following spring though Monet also produced earlier paintings using this same stack subject.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 the Davis Library {{was added}} to the campus with space for 5,000 volumes. Although a major improvement, its {{atmosphere}} was inhospitable by the standards of later generations. Stacks were locked to students, for example, and the librarian's office was located at the entrance to <b>the</b> <b>stacks</b> to maximize control over entry. Decisions about book selections and the library's program were {{in the hands of an}} all-male faculty committee instead of the female librarian.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{effects of}} light only {{last for a}} few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera {{received}} attention {{for no more than}} a few minutes a day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in each work, color is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of <b>the</b> <b>stacks</b> is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.|$|E

50|$|The Lua C API is stack based. Lua {{provides}} {{functions to}} push and pop most simple C data types (integers, floats, etc.) {{to and from}} <b>the</b> <b>stack,</b> as well as functions for manipulating tables through <b>the</b> <b>stack.</b> <b>The</b> Lua <b>stack</b> is somewhat different from a traditional stack; <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> can be indexed directly, for example. Negative indices indicate offsets {{from the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>stack.</b> For example, −1 is the top (most recently pushed value), while positive indices indicate offsets from the bottom (oldest value). Marshalling data between C and Lua functions is also done using <b>the</b> <b>stack.</b> To call a Lua function, arguments are pushed onto <b>the</b> <b>stack,</b> and then <b>the</b> lua_call is used to call the actual function. When writing a C function to be directly called from Lua, the arguments are read from <b>the</b> <b>stack.</b>|$|R
50|$|Popping <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> {{is simply}} <b>the</b> inverse of pushing. The topmost item in <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> is removed and <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> pointer is updated, in the {{opposite}} order of that used in the push operation.|$|R

25|$|Using {{the same}} total on the dice (or {{the total of}} the two throws), the player whose wall is chosen then counts <b>the</b> <b>stacks</b> of tiles from right to left. (For double throws, the count may extend {{to the left side}} player's stack.) This determines the {{location}} where the 'deck' of tiles is cut. Starting from the left of <b>the</b> <b>stacks</b> counted, the dealer draws four tiles for himself, and players in anti-clockwise order draw blocks of four tiles until all players have 12 tiles, so that <b>the</b> <b>stacks</b> decrease clockwise.

40|$|A 1 kW {{phosphoric acid}} fuel-cell (PAFC) stack with 30 cells, was designed, fabricated, {{assembled}} with "in-house" developed components at ERI, KACST, and successfully operated for 250 h. <b>The</b> <b>stack</b> was operated at 180 Â°C, 1 bar, using commercial H 2 /CO 2 gas and air. The electrical output power generated by <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> was ~ 1 kW (20. 5 x 50 A), with a current density of 125 mA/cm 2 {{at an average}} cell voltage of 0. 7 V. From {{the results of the}} successful operation of <b>the</b> <b>stack,</b> it was found that <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> was stable during the operation and the heat generated in <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> was sufficient to retain the temperature at 175 to 180 Â°C without any external heating.

50|$|When stack {{frame sizes}} can differ, such as between {{different}} functions or between invocations {{of a particular}} function, popping a frame off <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> does not constitute a fixed decrement of <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> pointer.
