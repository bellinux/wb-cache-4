5|$|The main factor {{behind the}} Finnish Civil War was World War I; the Russian Empire {{collapsed}} under <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, {{leading to the}} February and October Revolutions in 1917. The breakdown caused a large power vacuum and subsequent power struggle in Eastern Europe. The Grand Duchy of Finland, {{a part of the}} Russian Empire since 1809, became embroiled in the struggle for power. Geopolitically less important than the continental Moscow-Warsaw gateway, the northerly Finnish ground, isolated by the Baltic sea was a peaceful sidefront until early 1918. The war between the German Empire and Russia had indirect effects on the Finns. Since the end of 19th century, the Grand Duchy had become a vital source of raw materials, industrial products, food and labor for the growing Imperial Russian capital Petrograd (Saint Petersburg), and World War I emphasized the role. Strategically, the Finnish territory was the less marked northern section of the Estonian–Finnish gateway and buffer zone to and from Petrograd through the Narva area, the Gulf of Finland and the Karelian Isthmus.|$|E

While they advanced their own power, the Janissaries also helped to keep the system from changing in other progressive ways, and according to some scholars the corps was most responsible for the political stagnation of Istanbul.|$|E

25|$|Although {{he tried}} to avoid direct clashes with the Communist {{establishment}} after his release from jail, Javoršek {{was one of the}} main driving force behind the establishment of the Stage '57, an alternative theatre created in 1957 by the younger generations of Slovene artists, which had a crucial role in shaping their generation against <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> repressive cultural policies of the Communist regime. Already during his lifetime, he gained recognition in other parts of Yugoslavia, especially in Serbia. Some consider him to be one of the best essayists in the Slovene language, together with Ivan Cankar, Marjan Rožanc and Drago Jančar. His book La Memoire Dangereuse, published in the 1980s by the French publishing house Arléa, gained him an important recognition beyond Yugoslav borders.

25|$|For their part, the German {{high command}} misread the Allied objectives, believing the Allied assault to {{be a general}} {{pressure}} along the front designed to induce collapse at any given point. Hitler had agreed to a partial withdrawal in the north (the Erstein salient) during the night of 28 January but forbade a general withdrawal over the Rhine. German outposts in the Vosges Mountains were pulled back, but the confusion of the withdrawal and <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battlefield resulted in many units becoming mixed with one another.

25|$|In two of {{the general}} elections, in 1940 and 1968, they got more than 50%; however, both cases had special circumstances. In 1940 all {{established}} Swedish parties, except for the Communist Party, had a coalition government due to <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second World War, {{and it can be}} speculated that it led to voters most likely wanting one party to be in majority to give a parliament that couldn't be hung. In 1944 the tides of the war had turned and the allied nations looked to win, giving voters more confidence in voting by preference and explaining the more normal electoral result of 46.6%. Also there might very well have been some resentment among parts of the public regarding how the Communist Party was held out of the government, and in 1944 they got 10.3%. In 1968 the established Communist Party, most likely due to bad press about the communist overtaking of Czechoslovakia, got a historically very bad result of 3% of the votes, while the Social Democrats enjoyed 50.1% and their own majority in parliament.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{previous}} two shows in the continuity, Models Inc. did not experience any significant changes in character focus or tone. Instead, the writers chose to explore the ensemble cast from the start and immediately present the kind of story lines that had made Melrose Place famous. The initial focus of the series was a mystery surrounding the murder of model Teri Spencer (Stephanie Romanov), who'd announced her intentions to leave the agency. For a number of episodes throughout the first story arc, suspects included Hillary, Teri's ex-boyfriend Brian (Cameron Daddo), Teri's rival Julie (Kylie Travis), and Teri's own sister Carrie (Carrie-Anne Moss). Once the killer was revealed, the characters moved on, with their focus switching {{to the arrival of}} Stephanie Romanov's new character Monique, a model who was a nearly dead ringer for Teri. The remainder of the series largely centered around the models' growing relationships with their boyfriends and each other, while also dealing with the issues of substance abuse and <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> business. Primary antagonists included several figures from the models' pasts—including a stalker, a jealous sister, and Grayson (Emma Samms), the cunning and powerful ex-wife of Monique's fiance.|$|E

25|$|For about 30 {{years the}} city of Exeter {{operated}} a maintained school {{system in which the}} divisions between phases came at different ages from most of the United Kingdom, with first, middle and high rather than infant, junior and secondary schools, so that children transferred between schools at the age of about 8 and 12 rather than 7 and 11. From 2005, however, it has adopted the more usual pattern, because of <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UK National Curriculum. The changeover back to the more typical structure led to a citywide, PFI funded, rebuilding programme for the high schools and led to the changing of names for some schools. Following the reorganisation there are 25 primary schools, four referral schools, three special schools and five secondary schools within Exeter. The secondary schools are Isca Academy (formerly Priory High School), St James School (formerly St James High School), St Luke's Science and Sports College (formerly Vincent Thompson High School), St Peter's Church of England Aided School (a consolidation of the former Bishop Blackall High School for Girls and Heles High School for Boys), and West Exe School (formerly St Thomas High School).|$|E
25|$|With this {{domestic}} {{record of}} captaincy success, Deane was picked as captain for the South Africa side for the 1927–28 English tour of South Africa, ahead of Herbie Taylor who {{had led the}} 1924 tour of England, but whose form had reportedly suffered in the big matches from <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> captaincy. Poor batting led to defeat in the first match of the series {{and in the second}} the South Africans had a first-innings lead of 117, with Deane contributing 41 to a total of 250, but still lost the match by 87 runs. The turnaround in the series started with third Test, which was drawn with the South Africans finally posting a respectable total. Deane was instrumental in this: in the first innings, with the score at 146 for seven, he and Buster Nupen both made scores of more than 50, with Deane going on to 77. In the second innings, an all-round better batting performance by the South Africans secured the draw with Deane making a further 73. A new fast-medium bowling combination allied to less brittle batting brought a South African victory in the fourth Test, with Deane batting when victory by four wickets was achieved. And the series was tied at two wins apiece with a South African victory in the final match by eight wickets. As captain, Deane won the toss five times out of five in the series; unusually for the time in which he played, he put the England team in to bat three times, claiming that his young side would play better if they knew the odds they had to face.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} {{side effect}} {{of the war was}} the collapse of the system of rebuilding. Until the outbreak of the war, it had been the practice to rebuild ships periodically, to maintain the size of the fleet without alarming parliament with requests for new ships. In reality, many of these rebuilds amounted to just that, with little or no timber from the original ship surviving into her rebuilt form. In some cases, ships would be dismantled years before they actually underwent the rebuilding process, but remained on the active list for the entire time. Rebuilding a ship was a lengthy process, more time consuming and more expensive than building a completely new one. <b>The</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war meant that for drydocks to be taken up {{for long periods of time}} whilst a ship was surveyed to determine what timber was reusable in the new ship, and what could find a use elsewhere in the dockyard, disassembled and then rebuilt was counter-productive. Ships intended to be sent to the West Indies for service in the war required the use of drydocks to have their hulls appropriately sheathed to combat such problems as shipworm, and other uses of the drydocks for servicing the fleet meant that rebuilds were given a low priority. It was at this time that the British practise of converting old ships to hulks for expanded storage space in harbours began, as instead of wasting effort and dockyard space on breaking up an old vessel that was still perfectly capable of floating, they were converted to serve the dockyards in this new capacity. Few rebuilds were started after 1739, and none at all were begun after 1742, although any that had been started were allowed to complete.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Metal {{stamping}} {{is widely}} used in <b>the</b> mass-production process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> automobile industry. During the stamping process, air may be trapped between the draw die and <b>the</b> panel. <b>The</b> high <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> trapped air induces imperfections on the panel surface and creates a situation where an extremely high tonnage of punch is required. To prevent these problems, many air ventilation holes are drilled through the draw die and the punch. The present work has developed a simplified mathematical formulation for computing <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air pocket based on the ideal gas law and isentropic relation. <b>The</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air pocket was compared to the results by the commercial CFD code, Fluent, and experiments. The present work also used the Bisection method to calculate the optimum cross-sectional area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air ventilation holes, which did not make <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air pocket exceed the prescribed maximum value...|$|R
50|$|During {{the typical}} PCP's {{discharge}} cycle, <b>the</b> hammer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rifle is {{released by the}} sear to strike the bash valve. The hammer may move rearwards or forwards, unlike firearms where the hammer almost always moves forward. The valve is held closed by a spring and <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air in <b>the</b> reservoir. <b>The</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spring is constant, and <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air decreases with each successive shot. As a result, when <b>the</b> reservoir <b>pressure</b> is at its peak, the valve opens less fully and closes faster than when <b>the</b> reservoir <b>pressure</b> is lower, resulting in a similar total volume of air flowing past the valve with each shot. This results in a degree of self-regulation that gives a greater consistency of velocity from shot to shot. A well-designed PCP will display good shot to shot consistency as the air reservoir is depleted.|$|R
