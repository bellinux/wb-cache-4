5|$|During {{the first}} months of the war, airmen and {{anti-aircraft}} soldiers saw only sporadic combat; it was on 10May 1940, when Germany commenced the drive into <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> <b>that</b> the Swiss army as a whole was mobilized a second time. At the onset of the campaign, German military aircraft first violated Swiss airspace.|$|E

5|$|Among Harrison's most {{enduring}} legacies is {{the series of}} treaties that he either negotiated or signed with Native American leaders during his tenure as the Indiana territorial governor. As part of the treaty negotiations, the native tribes ceded large tracts of land in <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>that</b> provided additional acreage for purchase and settlement. Harrison's chief presidential legacy lies in his campaigning methods, which {{laid the foundation for}} the modern presidential campaign tactics.|$|E

5|$|In Bauer's view, the {{presence}} {{at one of}} the meetings of Gerhard Clages of the SS signals that Himmler was focusing on secret peace talks. Brand and Grosz arrived in Istanbul just two months before the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944. Himmler knew that attempts might be made on Hitler's life, though not where and when. It is possible that he wanted to broker for peace in case Hitler did not survive, using low-level agents for plausible deniability, and if Hitler did survive, Bauer argues, Himmler could offer him a peace deal with <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>that</b> excluded the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In {{a series}} of campaigns he {{recovered}} the provinces of Jazira, Thughur and Jibal, and effected a rapprochement with the Saffarids {{in the east and}} the Tulunids in <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>that</b> secured their—albeit largely nominal—recognition of caliphal suzerainty. These successes came at the cost of gearing the economy almost exclusively towards maintenance of the army, which resulted in the expansion and rise to power of the central fiscal bureaucracy and contributed to the Caliph's lasting reputation for avarice. Al-Mu'tadid was also renowned for his cruelty when punishing criminals, and subsequent chroniclers record his extensive and ingenious use of torture. His reign also saw the permanent move of the capital back to Baghdad, where he engaged in major building activities. A firm supporter of Sunni traditionalist orthodoxy, he nevertheless maintained good relations with the Alids, and was interested in natural sciences, renewing caliphal sponsorship of scholars and scientists.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} set of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924, most of legislative Route5 north of Oneonta—including the section between Richfield Springs and Mohawk—became part of NY28, which originally began in Oneonta and headed north through Richfield Springs and Mohawk before ending in Utica. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the section of NY28 between Richfield Springs and Mohawk was moved onto a new highway to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>that</b> went directly between the two locations. The portion of its former routing between Richfield Springs and Paines Hollow became part of the new NY167, which continued north from Paines Hollow to Dolgeville via Little Falls and old legislative Route37.|$|E

25|$|The {{campaign}} in <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>that</b> followed in 1940 {{demonstrated that the}} Bf 110 was vulnerable in hostile skies.

In the Western Campaign, 60 were lost. This represented 32 percent of the Zerstörerwaffes initial strength.|$|E

25|$|Mindful {{of these}} two disasters, the current {{building}} was designed by the New York City firm of Child & DeGroll to be as fireproof as possible, using less combustible materials like iron and brick.

25|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Widukind the Saxons continued to resist the Franks. In 782 the Frisians east of the Lauwers also began an uprising against the Franks. The uprising expanded to Frisian lands in <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>that</b> had been pacified earlier. This led to an en masse return to paganism by the population.

25|$|The Apostolic Fathers and the Apologists mostly {{dealt with}} topics other than {{original}} sin. The doctrine {{of original sin}} was first developed in 2nd-century Bishop of Lyon Irenaeus's struggle against Gnosticism. The Greek Fathers emphasized the cosmic dimension of the fall, namely that since Adam human beings are born into a fallen world, but held fast to belief that man, though fallen, is free. It was in <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>that</b> precise definition of the doctrine arose.|$|E
