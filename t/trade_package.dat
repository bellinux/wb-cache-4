40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} impact of a reduction in the minimum price increment on market quality and price impact in the 3 Year Commonwealth Treasury Bond Futures contract. Prior to the tick size reduction, the minimum tick was one basis point. However, as of December 15, 2006, the minimum price increment was reduced to half a basis point. Using two data sets, the first provided by SIRCA and the second a proprietary data set provided by the Sydney Futures Exchange, this study is the first to examine how a reduction in minimum tick affects both market quality and price impact in a futures market setting. This thesis contributes to, and extends, the literature on minimum tick size reductions in several ways. First, this thesis extends the tick size literature into futures markets. Second, the proprietary data set allows an analysis of how the reduction in tick size affects the price impact of institutional <b>trade</b> <b>packages.</b> Finally, this dissertation is the first tick size study to consider both the seasonality in bond futures trading as well as the virtual round-the-clock trading of futures. Results indicate that bid-ask spreads and quoted depth are significantly reduced after the tick reduction. While the price impact of small trades is insignificantly different from zero in all periods examined, after the tick size reduction, large <b>trade</b> <b>packages</b> experience reductions in price impact. These findings suggest that overall market quality has improved after the reduction in minimum tick. The improvements in market quality are isolated to the 3 year bond futures contract, with minimal variations in control contracts. Robustness tests isolate market quality improvements to the 3 year bond futures and attribute the improvement to the reduction in minimum tick. Financ...|$|R

We use <b>trade</b> <b>packages</b> from both active and passive equity funds from 1995 to 2001 and active equity funds from 2002 to 2010. We find that later period active funds recoup a combined 1. 75 basis point benefit (from price impact cost recovery and short-term alpha) per basis point of brokerage cost. Later period active investors saw improved trade price impact and shorter-term alpha net benefits, relative to earlier period active investors. These results are robust after controlling for trade characteristics and cross-sectional variation over time. Our findings suggest that brokers innovate to provide valuable services in the subsequent, lower brokerage environment. 26 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, Chinese State-Owned Enterprises {{have emerged as}} among the most active investors in Mekong Basin {{hydropower}} development. This paper uses a political economy analysis to examine the forces that drive Chinese State-Owned Enterprises to invest in hydropower in the Mekong Basin. We focus our analysis on the Lancang (Upper Mekong River) in China and in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), {{with an emphasis on}} Cambodia. The analysis reveals how powerful political and economic forces from within China and the GMS influence the pace, location and scale of investments in hydropower. These forces include foreign exchange reserves, <b>trade</b> <b>packages</b> and foreign direct investment, and political alliances. Combining the political economy and nexus approaches, we conclude that although policies from China recognize interconnections across the nexus, political and economic forces craft narratives that downplay or disregard these nexus interconnections and trade-offs. This in turn, influences how trade-offs and interconnections in hydropower development are managed and recognized in both local and transboundary contexts, thereby, creating potentially significant negative impacts on livelihoods, food security and the environment...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the market-impact cost of trades executed in futures markets, which is {{commonly referred to as}} slippage. With the use of a unique data set provided by the Sydney Futures Exchange, this article documents that slippage costs incurred in executing <b>packages</b> of <b>trades</b> in stock-index and interest-rate futures markets are significantly smaller than market-impact costs documented previously for equity markets. Furthermore, in contrast to research based on equity markets, {{there is little evidence that}} <b>trade</b> <b>packages</b> executed in futures markets convey information, or that purchases and sales behave differently. In fact, the evidence presented in this article implies that slippage in futures markets is entirely a liquidity cost, and symmetrical for purchases and sales. This is consistent with previous work, which conjectures that there is an absence of private information in stock-index and interest-rate futures markets. Finally, analogously to previous research, there is some evidence that trade size and the identity of traders are determinants of slippage; however, these variables explain less than 10 % of the total variation in slippage. 18 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates {{key issues}} {{concerning}} how active equity fund managers add value: measuring alpha (Chapter 3), generating alpha (Chapters 4, 5 and 6) and transaction cost minimisation (Chapter 7). Chapter 3 proposes important methodological {{adjustments to the}} widely adopted benchmarking methodology of Daniel, Grinblatt, Titman and Wermers (1997). Applying this modified benchmark {{to a sample of}} active funds and simulated passive portfolios that mimic fund manager style characteristics, statistically lower tracking error is documented, compared with using the standard methodology. These findings suggest that improved specifications of characteristic benchmarks represent better methods in accurately quantifying fund manager skill. Chapter 4 examines a portfolio strategy which selects stocks using the undisclosed monthly holdings of Australian active funds. When considering a large range of strategies incorporating portfolio holdings information, the top performing strategies are robust to data-snooping and are economically and statistically significant when incorporating transaction costs. Accounting for look-ahead bias in the formation of a strategy, statistically significant alpha of at least 6. 88 percent per year is found when following the best performing strategy holding 20 stocks or more in the previous month. Chapter 5 examines the relation of active equity fund managers location proximity to a stock's corporate headquarter using portfolio holdings data. Contrary to much international research, this study reveals evidence inconsistent with a location advantage for Melbourne and Sydney-based funds. Chapter 6 examines retail investor trading on the Australian Stock Exchange. The performance of retail investors is highly heterogeneous: discount (non-discount) retail brokerage investors lose - 0. 59 (- 0. 05) percent intraday and experience negative (positive) returns over the subsequent year. These findings are inconsistent with retail investors exerting price pressure or providing liquidity to institutions. Chapter 7 examines whether equity fund managers use multiple brokers in a <b>trade</b> <b>package</b> in order to lower their price impact and brokerage costs.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the ability of}} Australian active equity managers to provide superior risk adjusted performance. Utilising daily trade level data, we investigate the role of trade and manager characteristics in trading performance and market impact costs. In terms of trade characteristics, we find evidence of superior trade performance, where such performance is an increasing function of trade size, and a decreasing function of stock size. We also find however, that market impact costs erode {{a significant portion of}} the abnormal returns to <b>trade</b> <b>packages,</b> and that such costs are also a function of trade and stock size. These findings are consistent with the theory that managers are able to exploit private information more readily in smaller stocks where the level of monitoring by professional market participants is lower, however in doing so, managers also incur higher market impact costs due to the lower liquidity of smaller stocks. In terms of manager characteristics, we find large managers on average trade less successfully, and incur higher market impact costs than smaller managers. We also find evidence of persistence where managers outperforming over the past year are more likely to continue to trade successfully. JEL classification: G 2...|$|R
