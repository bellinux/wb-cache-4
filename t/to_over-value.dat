50|$|In social psychology, the {{fundamental}} attribution error (also known as correspondence bias or attribution effect) describes the tendency <b>to</b> <b>over-value</b> dispositional or personality-based {{explanations for the}} observed behaviors of others while under-valuing situational explanations for those behaviors.

This bias was first proposed by Edward E. Jones and Richard E.

Nevertheless, nanotechnology patents will serve as an important securitization instrument for future financing and business strategic purposes. Valuation know-how of nanotechnology patents will therefore become critical in deal-making and in bringing about innovation. Like many innovative products today, nanotechnology enabled products also consist of a multitude of patented technological components from different stages in a value chain and belonging to a multitude of owners. Complex IP landscapes along entire value chains give rise to a tendency <b>to</b> <b>over-value</b> one's own patented technology from an ex-ante and individual company's perspective. Thus the sum of individually estimated values of patented technology can exceed the value that can be realized ex-post in a given value chain. We extend current valuation considerations of patented technology from a static perspective to include a dynamic view using nanotechnology as an example. Furthermore, in addition to single value chain stages as a level of analysis (level A) we also take into account the complex technology landscapes in entire value chains (level B) as well as patented technologies' potential value in different current or future value chains (level C). We derive conclusions with respect to valuation approaches for the discussed levels of analysis from a static and dynamic perspective.

40|$|This article opens by {{considering}} an apparent paradox. Many professional journalists, working on many media in many countries, consider themselves 'objective'. They do not, at least, {{set out to}} skew their coverage of important issues in favour of {{one side or the}} other. And yet much of their coverage of conflicts shows a discernible dominant pattern of War Journalism - biased in favour of war. This is not {{because of a lack of}} objectivity, the article suggests, but a surfeit. The set of conventions many editors and reporters regard as defining 'objective' journalism arose in response to economic and political conditions which rewarded news that could commend itself as unobjectionable to the maximum number of potential customers. Three of the most important conventions privilege official sources; a dualistic construction of stories and event, over process. Each of these, when applied to the representation of conflicts, leads readers and audiences - or leaves them - <b>to</b> <b>over-value</b> violent, reactive responses and under-value non-violent, developmental responses. Industry conventions sit uneasily alongside equally time-honoured expectations of journalism. These are encoded in rules and regulations governing the content of broadcast news, in many jurisdictions which have a public service concept for radio and television. In some respects, War Journalism can be shown to make it more difficult for broadcast news services to fulfil their public service obligations. Awareness is now growing, of the tension between these two pressures on journalism and its influence on the way pressing public debates are shaped and mediated. More Peace Journalism would help to bring public service news back into line with legitimate public expectations. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} twenty-first century, museums {{increasingly}} turn to "social media" to engage audiences {{and in these}} efforts they routinely imagine them as "communities. " This dissertation tends {{to the politics of}} that choice, which extends a long history of museums employing community as a strategy towards institutional reform. Museums invoke community in numerous ways but without typically articulating those meanings, even though they influence the implementation and evaluation of social media projects. I argue that this lack of articulation creates a "fog" over practices [...] an ambiguous and confusing context of work [...] in which community operates as a "self-evident good," but serves traditional interests as much as transformative ones. To expose the many ideas that lay within this fog, I examine how American museums invoked community throughout the last century, showing how they use it both to reinforce their power and alter relations with audiences. After exploring how community has been conceptualized through networked digital media and social media [...] technologies and a culture that emphasize openness, communication, collaboration, and the materialization of digital bodies [...] I show how museums continue to use community in complex ways. As social media conflate community with communication [...] specifically "face-to-face," or immediate, communication, I argue they influence museums <b>to</b> <b>over-value</b> visible acts of communication, which narrows their understanding of online visitor engagement and dilutes the potential of community to shape projects that more conscientiously serve audiences and institutional reform. To illustrate the complexity of these ideas at work, I present three case studies of museums using social media to construct community: the Getty Center's blog, A Different Lens; the Japanese American National Museum's website, Discover Nikkei; and the website of the Science Museum of Minnesota's Science Buzz. I expose the definitions of community at work in each, examine how they influence the use of media, and work to limit and serve the project's various democratizing goals. The conclusion offers a nascent problematique that suggests more critical approaches museums may take for invoking community and using social media towards democratizing aims...|$|E
30|$|Compared with {{developed}} countries, Turkey had highest ULC {{growth in}} both non-tradable goods and export goods.

Moreover, Turkey’s inflation rate was greater than that of other countries. During the period 1985 – 2003, the most important point in Turkey contrary to other countries, wage rate growth increased significantly, to 66.2 %, and inflation climbed to 63.5 % (see Table  1). Although Turkey was able to decrease wage rate growth to 11.2 % between 2003 and 2011, it remained higher than the productivity growth of export goods and non-tradable goods. Hence, Turkey came under the dominance of the over-valued currency model due <b>to</b> its <b>over-valued</b> currency and high-cost production.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show at {{theoretical}} level that maintaining a competitive real exchange rate positively affects the economic growth of developing countries by means of a Keynesian-Structuralist model that combines elements of Kaleckian growth models with the balance of payments constrained growth models pioneered developed by Thirlwall. In this setting, the level of real exchange rate is capable, due to its effect over capital accumulation, to induce a structural change in the economy, making endogenous income elasticities of exports and imports. For reasonable parameter values it is shown that in steady-state growth there is two long-run equilibrium values for real exchange rate, one that corresponds to an under-valued currency and another that corresponds <b>to</b> an <b>over-valued</b> currency. If monetary authorities run exchange rate policy in order to target a competitive level for real exchange rate, than under-valued equilibrium is stable and the economy will show a high growth rate in the long-run...|$|R
50|$|Another {{method is}} via a {{so-called}} 130/30 strategy. The idea is relatively simple: the manager shorts some fixed {{percentage of the}} portfolio (in this case, 30%), and uses the proceeds for further purchases. The purchase of additional assets with the full capital from the short sale is made possible by what is called an enhanced prime brokerage structure. This raises the long portion of the portfolio to 130% of the original investment capital. The net effect of this strategy is to separate the portfolio into two portions: the first portion is long only, yielding beta returns; the second is long/short and market neutral, yielding alpha returns. The strategy allows managers to bet against specific stocks they believe <b>to</b> be <b>over-valued,</b> rather than being restricted only to stocks they believe will increase in value (as {{is the case in}} a long-only portfolio). For example, investment bank Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s model global long-only portfolio invests in around 200 stocks; by comparison its Global Flex model portfolio (following a 130/30 strategy) invests in approximately 250 stocks and shorts about 100 - giving a total of some 350 names.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} certain {{economical}} {{questions concerning the}} choice of design of building parts (outer-walls, inner-walls, staircases etc.) are discussed. Primarily the dimensions of building parts as a function-of-the-profitable area are studied. The author has in his economical calculations tried to differentiate strictly between cost and value. This has been considered a basic condition for correct comparative economical analyses. Cost {{can be characterized as}} a sacrifice expressed in money for the production and sales of a product including normal profit. The value of the product can on the other hand be regarded as a subjective amount depending in addition to these costs on who the valuer is. The design of the building part can amongst other things be studied {{from the point of view}} of the area which it covers. By giving this area a value it is possible to make economical dimensioning calculations. If it is assumed that the floor-area is constant (fixed outerdimensions) the area value can have direct significance on the choice of the design of a building part. For example if the saved area can be valued highly it can be economically defensible to choose constructions which take up a small area even if these relatively mean higher costs. The size of the area value will depend on the assumptions fundamental to the valuing. The following two methods of valuing have been analysed more deeply, namely, each usable square meter is given in principle the same value in the house and each additional usable square meter is valued in relation to its cost (marginal-cost). In the first case mentioned with the constant value per area it is easy <b>to</b> <b>over-value</b> the area won(choice of less space-craving constructions) in relation to its cost. The disadvantage with overvaluing can be avoided if one instead values in relation to the marginal-costs for the extra area. The area value will on the other hand lose all significance if the size of the usable area is determined in the planning work. The result will be that in the choice of the design one can concentrate entirely on analysing the dimensions which require a minimum of costs. This can in its turn mean that one will choose more space-craving but less moneycraving constructions. QC 2011061...|$|E
40|$|In this essay, I {{will offer}} some {{thoughts}} on how we might reframe the issues governing the admissibility of expert evidence. My principal focus is not on any particular type of expert evidence but on broader questions: {{the extent to which}} we ought to rely on rulings of admissibility, the standards that should govern admissibility rulings, {{and the role of the}} trial and appellate courts in making those rulings. To some extent, I will concentrate on the context of criminal cases, but for the most part my conclusions apply in both civil and criminal litigation. Here are my conclusions: First, the standards for treatment of expert evidence should differ depending on the litigation context. Standards should be very lenient for criminal defendants, and tougher for prosecutors, with the standards for civil litigants somewhere in between. Second, more than has been the case, the test that carries the bite with respect to expert evidence should be one of sufficiency rather than of admissibility. Third, the model created by Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2 ̆ 7 and General Electric Company v. Joiner, and extended by Kumho Tire Company, Ltd. v. Carmichael, 2 ̆ 7 in which trial courts, reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard, act as gatekeeepers to prevent jurors from being bamboozled by unreliable evidence, is not a useful one. Reliability is an inappropriate, misleading standard for testing the admissibility of expert evidence. It does not reflect the way we should think about admissibility issues, and it ought to be discarded. Moreover, trial courts are not well positioned to sort the good from the bad. Where it is appropriate to exclude evidence, the decision usually should be made as a matter of law. This is because the difficulties that are most likely to warrant exclusion usually share either or both of these characteristics: (i) they are recurrent matters (including the behavior of repeat players) for which a consistent resolution across cases is appropriate; or (ii) they involve errors, particularly inferential errors, in the way the evidence is presented that make it affirmatively misleading. Fourth, in some settings, as a less restrictive alternative to exclusion, courts should admit expert evidence but explain to the jury factors limiting the weight that the jury should accord the evidence. I believe that we should be considerably more generous than we have been with respect to expert evidence offered by the defense, and the net effect of my suggestions would probably be greater generosity with respect to expert evidence offered in civil cases. With respect to the principal focus of this article, expert evidence offered by a prosecution, my overall aim is not to argue that we should be more or less generous than we have been. But I do believe we need to restructure the way we think about the admissibility of such evidence. Sometimes the courts should exclude such evidence as a matter of law because it is affirmatively misleading, or because exclusion will induce the presentation of better evidence. Sometimes the trial court should admit the evidence but comment adversely on it. Sometimes the court should deem the evidence admissible but nevertheless hold that the evidence taken as a whole does not support a verdict. But if none of these principles apply and the expert evidence has significant probative value the court should not exclude it on the ground that it is unreliable, and rarely if at all should the court exclude it on the mere ground that the jury is likely <b>to</b> <b>over-value</b> it. Thus, I am suggesting that Daubert be squeezed out of the picture by other approaches to the problem...|$|E
30|$|The {{question}} at the centre of CSR literature is - what responsibility does the mining sector have to its employees and local communities, and perhaps the broader society?

40|$|For a {{comprehensive}} sample of UK cash acquirers, we can reject the Free Cash Flow (FCF) hypothesis. Both at announcement {{and over the}} 60 month post acquisition window, high FCF firms out-perform low FCF firms. There {{is no evidence that}} high FCF, low q firms under-perform. In fact, they appear to be the best-performing sub-group at announcement and over the long term. Contrary to the expectation under the FCF hypothesis, it seems that the announcement period return difference between high FCF and low FCF firms is strongest amongst firms using internal finance. At announcement, low FCF, high q firms are the group of firms that exhibit the worst returns. This effect is robust in regression-based tests that control for factors shown to influence announcement returns elsewhere, and such tests also reveal that high pre-bid gearing has a weak but negative influence on announcement returns. In the longer term, over the 5 years post-bid low FCF firms as a whole exhibit significant negative performance, although the worst performing sub-group is the group of high q, high FCF firms. This particular effect appears to be driven by q being a proxy for over-valuation. We also show that low FCF, high q firms have the highest loadings on the SMB and HML factors, and that low FCF firms have higher loadings on these factors than high FCF firms. Our results are consistent with low FCF firms having a greater likelihood of being financially distressed, and high q firms being more likely <b>to</b> be <b>over-valued.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of three papers. Credit Rating and Competition (co-authored wth Pragyan Deb and Nelson Camanho) studies the behaviour of credit rating agencies in a competitive framework {{with the presence of}} conflicts of interest. We show that competition for market share through reputation is insufficient to discipline rating agencies in equilibrium. More importantly, our results suggest that, in most cases, competition will aggravate the lax behaviour of rating agencies, resulting in greater ratings inflation. This result has important policy implications since it suggests that enhanced competition in the ratings industry is likely to make the situation worse. Credit Default Swaps - Default Risk, Counter-party Risk and Systemic Risk examines the implications of CDS on systemic risk. I show that CDS can contribute to systemic risk in two ways: through counter-party risk and through sharing of default risks. A central clearing house, which can only reduce counter-party risk, {{is by no means a}} panacea. More importantly, excessive risk taken by one reckless institution may spread to the entire financial system via the CDS market. This could potentially explain the US government's decision to bail out AIG during the recent financial crisis. Policies requiring regulatory disclosure of CDS trades would be desirable. Investor Cash Flow and Mutual Fund Behaviour (co-authored with Zhigang Qiu) analyzes the trading incentives of mutual fund managers. In open-ended funds, investors are only willing to invest in the fund when the share price of the fund is expected to increase, i. e. the fund is expected to make profits in the future. We show that the fund manager may buy the asset even when he perceives the asset <b>to</b> be <b>over-valued,</b> given that his portfolio choices are disclosed to the investors and that he is paid a fixed fraction of the terminal value of the fund...|$|R
30|$|In the 2000 – 2001 {{economic}} crisis, {{a significant}} institutional change {{emerged in the}} exchange rate system, intended to reduce the over-valuation of the lira {{and bring it to}} its real rate. Between 1960 and 1980, the exchange rate system was fixed. From 1985 to 2001, it was a managed exchange rate system. 26 In the early 2000 s, Turkey finally adopted the floating exchange rate system, which eliminated speculation on the lira, although the currency acquired an over-valued exchange rate because of short-term capital flows. The exchange rate had been controlled by the government and the central bank until 2001. In 2001, due to the floating exchange rate system, the government lost its command of the exchange rate, which gave independence to the CBRT. The last major depreciation of the lira in 2001 occurred due to an institutional change to the floating exchange rate (see Fig.  3). Nevertheless, wage rate growth and inflation were still high, and the lira remained over-valued. This shows that Turkey was unable to implement sufficient institutional changes <b>to</b> leave the <b>over-valued</b> currency model. 27 In other words, Turkey could not diminish path dependency and develop an institutional complementarity.|$|R
50|$|When the Nixon shock {{happened}} in August 1971, BOJ should have appreciated the currency {{in order to}} avoid inflation. However, they still kept the fixed exchange rate as 360Yen/$ for two weeks, so it caused excess liquidity. In addition, they persisted with the Smithsonian rate (308Yen/$), and continued monetary easing until 1973. This created a greater than 10% inflation rate at that time. In order to control the stagflation, they raised the official bank rate from 7% to 9% and gradually skyrocketing prices ended in 1978. In 1979, when the energy crisis happened, they raised the official bank rate rapidly. BOJ succeeded in a quick economic recovery. After overcoming the crisis, they reduced the official bank rate. In 1980, BOJ reduced the official bank rate from 9.0% to 8.25% in August, to 7.25% in November, and to 5.5% in December in 1981. Reaganomics was set in America, and USD became strong. However, Japan tried to make fiscal reconstruction at that time, so they did not stop their financial regulation. In 1985, the agreement of G5 nations, known as the Plaza agreement, USD slipped down and Yen/USD changed from 240yen/$ to 200yen/$ at the end of 1985. Even in 1986, USD continued to fall and reached 160yen/$. In order to escape deflation, BOJ cut the official bank rate from 5% to 4.5% in January, to 4.0% in March, to 3.5% in April, 3.0% in November. At the same time, the government tried to raise the demand in Japan in 1985, and did economy policy in 1986. However, the market was confused about the rapid fall of USD. After Louvre Accord in February 1987, BOJ decreased the official bank rate from 3% to 2.5%, but JPN/USD was 140yen/$ at that time and reached 125yen/$ in the end of 1987. BOJ kept the official bank rate at 2.5% until May in 1989. The financial and fiscal regulation led <b>to</b> a widespread <b>over-valuing</b> of real estate and investments and Japan faced a bubble at that time.After 1990, the stock market and real asset market fell, at that time BOJ regulated markets until 1991 in order to end the bubble. In 1994, a terrible earthquake happened and Japanese yen became weaker and weaker. JPM/USD reached 80yen/$, so BOJ had to reduce the office bank rate to 0.5% and Japanese yen recovered. The long deflation for 20 years started at that time. In 1999, BOJ started zero-interest-rate policy, but they ended it despite government opposition when the IT bubble {{happened in}} 2000. However, Japan faced economic bubble burst in 2001, BOJ adopted the balance of current account as the main operating target for the adjustment of the financial market in March 2001 (quantitative relaxation policy), shifting from the zero-interest-rate policy. From 2003 to 2004, Japanese government did exchange intervention operation in huge amount, and the economy recovered a lot. In March 2006, BOJ finished qualitative easing, and finished the zero-interest-rate policy in June and raised to 0.25%. In 2008, the financial crisis happened, and Japanese economy turned to bad again. BOJ reduced uncollateralized call rate to 0.3% and adopted the supplemental balance of current account policy. In December 2008, BOJ reduced uncollateralized call rate again to 0.1% and they started to buy Japanese Government Bond (JGB).|$|R
