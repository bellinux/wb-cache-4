5|$|Balzac {{began using}} {{characters}} from earlier works in his 1835 novel Le Père Goriot, {{and made the}} technique a hallmark of his fiction. In the case of Z. Marcas, the narrator– Charles Rabourdin, whose identity is only revealed {{at the end of}} the story– is in fact the son of a central character from Balzac's 1837 tale La Femme supérieure. The title character of <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> married to Xavier Rabourdin, who is unjustly ignored for a promotion to the head of his civil service department. At the end of the La Femme supérieure, Rabourdin pledges to his wife that they will enjoy success in the world of business. His son's poverty in Z. Marcas is evidence of his failure.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this time he met the Countess Vera Rossakoff, a glamorous jewel thief. The history of the Countess is, like Poirot's, steeped in mystery. She claims {{to have been a}} member of the Russian {{aristocracy}} before the Russian Rebellion and suffered greatly as a result, but how much of <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> true is an open question. Even Poirot acknowledges that Rossakoff offered wildly varying accounts of her early life. Poirot later became smitten with the woman and allowed her to escape justice.|$|E
500|$|Many {{elements}} of the exterior design are representations of interior functionality. Because the Common Council chamber {{is located on the}} second floor (above the entrance), <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> the same height as the first-floor entrance hall. The tower is essentially window-less because {{it was meant to be}} the city archive; a round staircase extends up the southeast corner of the tower for access. The short tower on the building's southeast corner was originally meant to be the transition between city hall and the (to-be built) jail, complete with a [...] "bridge of sighs" [...] to transport inmates straight from their cells in the jail to the court rooms in city hall.|$|E

500|$|Crown Duel {{has been}} labeled a coming-of-age story. According to The ALAN Review, Mel's [...] "journey from captivity to freedom {{parallels}} her coming of age," [...] {{in which she}} [...] "comes {{to realize that she}} has led a very sheltered life and that people are often not what they seem." [...] This teenage perspective affects how the reader views the novel's events – Smith has commented that if she [...] "see a story from a kid's eye view, then what shapes <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> how kids look at the world." [...] In Brigham Young University's Children's Book and Play Review, Leah Hanson wrote that as a result, [...] "we view the happenings at court with her same confusion and suspicion." [...] Writing for the same publication, Lillian H. Heil added that [...] "the reader learns to expect that she will plunge into every situation with minimal thought about the consequences." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the five-hour BBC adaptation, Wright compressed his film into two hours and nine minutes of screen time. He remarked that the film is [...] "obviously about Elizabeth and Darcy, following them and anything that detracts or diverts you from <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> {{what you have to}} cut". Some of the most notable changes from the original book include time compression of several major sequences, including the departure of Wickham and the militia, Elizabeth's visit to Rosings Park and Hunsford Parsonage, Elizabeth's visit to Pemberley, Lydia's elopement and subsequent crisis; the elimination of several supporting characters, including Mr and Mrs Hurst, Mr and Mrs Phillips, Lady and Maria Lucas, Mrs Younge, several of Lydia's friends (including Colonel and Mrs Forster) and various military officers and townspeople; and the elimination of several sections in which characters reflect or converse on events that have recently occurred—for example, Elizabeth's chapter-long change of mind after reading Darcy's letter.|$|E
500|$|... "Pokey Mom" [...] {{was written}} by Tom Martin and {{directed}} by Bob Anderson {{as part of the}} twelfth season of The Simpsons (2000–2001). According to then-showrunner Mike Scully, the story of this episode originated {{from the fact that the}} staff members of The Simpsons wanted to do an episode about Marge but felt they did not want it to revolve around her getting a new job, as that had been seen on the show [...] "too often". They decided to explore one of Marge's attributes that had been seen in earlier episodes, eventually choosing her interest in art. Martin conceived of the sub-plot surrounding Homer following a visit to a chiropractor. He has said that the [...] "heart" [...] of <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> that the chiropractors in Springfield become opposed to Homer's method of healing people and try to stop it after losing business, in reference to how chiropractors in real-life [...] "are a bit hated by the AMA (American Medical Association)" [...] and how the AMA has tried to restrict their businesses in the past. Martin has also noted that the episode shows how [...] "a lot of chiropractors are these great healers and they do great work, and then there's some that are crooked." ...|$|E
30|$|It <b>is</b> {{often said}} <b>that</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> {{different}} from documentaries: a <b>story</b> <b>is</b> fiction, a documentary {{has to do}} with facts. A movie that is based on facts but poses as a documentary is therefore an historical falsification.|$|R

500|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} positively by the trade publications. The Moving Picture World stated, [...] "The dramatic qualities {{of this film}} are high, but the subject is somewhat depressing... Maybe the picture will teach the lesson {{that it is better}} to listen to explanations at first and save all those intervening years of sorrow and suffering. It ought to, at any rate, because <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> plainly wrought out and is apparent as it is possible to make it." [...] A review in The Nickelodeon offered little more than a summary of the film, but the reviewer found the subject to be enhanced by the attention to detail in the production. The reviewer was also pleased that the child was not brought in to serve as in deus ex machina role. Though Lonergan was fond of using the technique. Even The New York Dramatic Mirror gave some praise to the production, but noted that the acting of the mother's friend was the weakest because [...] " [...] man of his [...] wouldn't have backed off so quickly." [...] Overall, the reviewer found the acting to be better than the narrative itself and concluded that [...] "omething less laboredly sentimental would be much stronger." ...|$|E
500|$|Spaihts was {{tasked with}} {{exploring}} unresolved mysteries from Alien, {{such as the}} Space Jockey. He considered the mysteries of Alien to be alien in nature, and said, [...] "all the mysteries have alien players: the exoskeleton nightmare and... the elephantine titan that was called the 'space jockey'... How do you make anyone care about events between creatures like this?" [...] His solution was to link the alien mysteries {{to the past and}} future of humanity. He said: [...] "if <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> somehow ours and deeply enmeshed with the human story. That story changes meaning within our own life, things of such significance that we think of our own lives differently." [...] Spaihts found translating Scott's stylistic visual concepts to text difficult, and he periodically constrained some of Scott's ideas. He reminded Scott that in the scene they were discussing, the characters were subject to gravity and so could not simply float. By April 2010, the script was on the fourth draft. Scott said about the script, [...] "we are talking about gods and engineers. Engineers of space. And were the aliens designed as a form of biological warfare? Or biology that would go in and clean up a planet?" [...] In June 2010, Scott announced that the script was complete and ready for filming.|$|E
500|$|Lynsey {{was found}} dead by Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan). The death sparked a [...] "whodunit storyline" [...] with Mercedes in the frame for her murder. Digital Spy {{explained}} her motives stating, [...] "Mercedes has also become increasingly deranged in recent weeks and wanted to keep Lynsey quiet after she discovered the truth about her stalking of Mitzeee". A promotional image featuring Mercedes was later released by Hollyoaks which confirmed Mercedes as an official suspect in the mystery. Mercedes entered a relationship with Doctor Browning, who had previously paid her for sex, {{in an attempt to}} make Riley jealous. Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she [...] "was nervous about the union of the dark soul mates, Mercy and Browning, but their chemistry is so watchable - <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> pretty dark". Mercedes began to [...] "fall for the charms" [...] of Doctor Browning, believing she had [...] "landed on her feet" [...] when he invited her to a charity ball. Metcalfe commented that Mercedes began to think he could provide her with the WAG life style that she had always wanted. She added that Mercedes still had feelings for Riley and was [...] "being very sneaky" [...] in her attempts to win him back. She explained that Mercedes [...] "still wants Riley back but, as we know, when she has everything she desires, she still craves a bit of danger". Thompson elaborated on this, saying Mercedes [...] "thinks she wants the quiet life with Riley, but Dr Browning offers an exciting alternative for her, he knows what makes her tick, {{and the two of them}} are excited by how dangerous the other is". On Doctor Browning's feelings for Mercedes, Thompson said: [...] "he's fallen for her and will do whatever it takes to be with her. He thinks if he spends enough time with Mercy, he'll win her around". When Doctor Browning witnessed Riley kiss Mercedes [...] "it becomes a question of how much he can take" [...] and he decided he must [...] "make a quick move" [...] to prevent them reuniting. To do this he takes Mercedes to a shooting range, Thompson explained that there she [...] "realises there's an undeniable connection between them". He added that the couple are [...] "kindred spirits" [...] and Mercedes spending time with him made her rethink their relationship. Thompson said [...] "it seemed to be written in the stars that Mercedes and Riley will get back together - but Dr Browning won't let that happen" [...] and to do this he threatened Riley. Thompson claimed that due to Doctor Browning having incriminating evidence showing that Mercedes discharged herself at the time Lynsey was murdered it gives him [...] "real power, she thinks she's in control, but she might just be underestimating Dr Browning..." [...] Metcalfe said that she feels Doctor Browning is Mercedes soul mate, explaining that [...] "he gives as good as he gets and I think that's really good for my character". On who Mercedes loves more out of Doctor Browning and Riley, Metcalfe said [...] "it's Doctor Browning all the way for her, i think he really took her by storm and she absolutely adores him". On 17 August 2012 during E4's first look episode it was revealed Doctor Browning had killed Lynsey. Hollyoaks official website said Doctor Browning's motives in killing Lynsey were [...] "presumably to protect Mercedes".|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} investigates the {{perception}} of technical descriptions and of stories where the events are driven by the motivations and emotions of their characters. The study is explorative, using mixed qualitative and quantitative methods and {{with a total of}} 10 participants. The participants accepted the use of stories and strongly preferred stories with emotional and dramatic elements. The study indicates <b>that</b> human-centered <b>stories</b> encourage and facilitate detailed discussions of social aspects and situations of use, whereas technical descriptions may block such discussions. The study indicate <b>that</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> not a reliable mean of changing the attitudes of the readers, and it shows <b>that</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> not better than technical descriptions for communicating factual or technical information...|$|R

2500|$|Producer {{and singer}} Joe Henry, in a 2011 interview, cited [...] "Ode" [...] as [...] "an {{incredibly}} deft bit of {{writing in the}} way that <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> unfolded. … [...] places the character in a moment, and then the story just starts to unfold around it", and was a song that influenced him early in his life listening to music on the radio.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "The Sound of Drums", the Master ages the Doctor by 100 years {{using his}} laser screwdriver, leaving the Doctor with an elderly appearance. In [...] "Last of the Time Lords", the Master {{states to the}} {{population}} of Earth that the Doctor is nine hundred years old, and informs his subjects he will show them the Doctor's true form, suspending his ability to regenerate. The Master proceeds to age the Doctor further with his laser screwdriver, reducing him to a tiny, wrinkled being, subsequently imprisoned inside a bird cage until reverted to his current form {{with the help of}} Martha Jones, 15 satellites and the entire population of Earth. However, as the resolution of <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> by means of a reversal of time, there is a suggestion that the events of that year never actually took place, and yet are present in the Doctor's memory.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most widely}} planted grape {{varieties}} in the Hunter Valley, in descending order, are Chardonnay, Semillon and Verdelho among the whites and Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot among the reds. Prior {{to the late}} 1960s, {{there was very little}} Chardonnay found in Australia. In the Hunter Valley Penfolds has a small experimental planting. According to Murray Tyrrell of Tyrrell Vineyards, one night he jumped the barb wire fence of Penfolds and pruned a couple cuttings from Penfolds' vine and planted them in his vineyard. Whether or not <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> true is hard to prove but Tyrrell's 1971 Vat 47 Chardonnay is widely credited with ushering in the Australian Chardonnay craze of the late 20th century. [...] Today in the Upper Hunter Valley, Chardonnay account for more than 70% of the areas planted and is sometimes blended with Semillon. Hunter Valley Chardonnay is characterised by its rich, oaky flavours with peaches and cream notes.|$|E

2500|$|A {{story of}} the [...] "Water of Life" [...] appears in the Eastern {{versions}} of the Alexander romance, which describes Alexander the Great and his servant crossing the Land of Darkness to find the restorative spring. The servant in <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> in turn derived from Middle Eastern legends of Al-Khidr, a sage who appears also in the Qur'an. Arabic and Aljamiado versions of the Alexander Romance were very popular in Spain {{during and after the}} period of Moorish rule, and would have been known to the explorers who journeyed to America. These earlier accounts inspired the popular medieval fantasy The Travels of Sir John Mandeville, which also mentions the Fountain of Youth as located {{at the foot of a}} mountain outside Polombe (modern Kollam) in India. Due to the influence of these tales, the Fountain of Youth legend was popular in courtly Gothic art, appearing for example on the ivory Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264) and several ivory mirror-cases, and remained popular through the European Age of Exploration.|$|E

[...] <b>That</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> interwoven with unreliable tales of Jaka's childhood told by a writer, representing Oscar Wilde, using notes and stories provided by Rick. In the end Cerebus disguises himself and travels to the Lower City to buy a jar of paint. While he is gone, the Cirinists find the tavern, kill Pud and arrest Jaka, Rick, and Oscar. [...] Jaka is made to sign a confession of immoral behavior, and is reunited with Rick; however, the Cirinists reveal to Rick that Jaka aborted the son that Rick always wanted. He lashes out at Jaka and is allowed to divorce her (although he is maimed for striking her). Jaka returns to Palnu, and Cerebus returns to the inn to find it in ruins.|$|E
