25|$|On August 20, 1057, Isaac Komnenos {{drew out}} his forces and {{arranged}} them for battle at a plain called, according to Michael Attaleiates, Polemon or Haidos. Kekaumenos commanded the left wing, Romanos Skleros the right, and Komnenos positioned {{himself in the}} centre. On the imperial side, Prince Aaron was stationed on the left wing, Basil Tarchaneiotes was positioned on the right, and the centre was commanded by Theodore the Eunuch. The imperial left wing under Prince Aaron completely routed the rebel right wing. Pursuing their troops to the rebel camp, he proceeded to capture Romanos Skleros {{and was on the}} cusp of victory when he hesitated, unsure of his next move. Komnenos, on the verge of fleeing to Nicaea, was able <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> and review what was happening on his left.|$|E
25|$|On January 3, 2014, Phil Everly died at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, 16 {{days before}} his 75th birthday, of lung disease. Phil's widow Patti openly blamed her husband's death on his smoking habit, which caused him to develop chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease, and recounted Phil spending his final years having to carry oxygen tanks with him wherever he went and taking 20 different types of medications per day. She stated that although Phil had stopped smoking in 2001, his lungs had already sustained permanent damage. Phil's last public appearance was in 2011, at Buddy Holly's induction to Hollywood Boulevard's Star Walk of Fame, and he was then struggling <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> as he addressed the crowd. Patti established the Phil Everly Memorial COPD Foundation in 2014.|$|E
500|$|Duckles {{examined}} the song [...] "If Loue loues truth then woemen doe not loue" [...] by Thomas Campion which appears as no. 10 of Drexel 4257 {{and was also}} published in Campion's Third Book of Ayres from about 1617. Campion was generally a conservative composer. [...] In the version present in Drexel 4257, the melody is slightly altered to provide greater sensitivity to the declamatory text, so that {{the speed of the}} verse accelerates naturally, an alteration which Duckles finds an improvement over the original. [...] Many songs are recitative-like. In some of these songs, the bar is enlarged as it approaches the cadence, suggesting a ballad singer who briefly pauses <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> The hemiola a consistent practice in English music of this time.|$|E
60|$|He had to {{stop talking}} <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> at <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> <b>His</b> arm twisted into Raut's with benumbing tightness. He had come striding down the black path towards the railway {{as though he was}} possessed. Raut had not spoken a word, had simply hung back against Horrocks' pull with all his strength.|$|R
6000|$|Alas, how {{fleeting}} and how vain Is {{even the}} nobler man, our learning and our wit! [...] I sigh whene'er I think of it: [...] As at the closing an unhappy scene [...] Of some great king and conqueror's death, [...] When the sad melancholy Muse Stays but <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> utmost <b>breath.</b> I grieve, this nobler work, most happily begun, So quickly and so wonderfully carried on, May fall {{at last to}} interest, folly, and abuse. [...] There is a noontide in our lives, [...] Which still the sooner it arrives, Although we boast our winter sun looks bright, And foolishly are glad to see it at its height, Yet so much sooner comes the long and gloomy night. [...] No conquest ever yet begun, And by one mighty hero carried to its height, E'er flourished under a successor or a son; It lost some mighty pieces through all hands it pass'd, And vanish'd to an empty title in the last. [...] For, when the animating mind is fled, [...] (Which nature never can retain, [...] Nor e'er call back again,) The body, though gigantic, lies all cold and dead.|$|R
60|$|This {{had been}} Dick's one great gift to Paula. It was love-lavish {{as only a}} king of fortune could make it. He {{had given her a}} free hand with it, and insisted on her wildest extravagance; and it had been his delight to tease his quondam guardians with the stubs of the checkbook she had used. It bore no {{relation}} to the scheme and architecture of the Big House, and, for that matter, so deeply hidden was it that it played no part in jar of line or color. A show-place of show-places, it was not often shown. Outside Paula's sisters and intimates, on rare occasions some artist was permitted <b>to</b> enter and <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Graham had heard of its existence, but not even him had she invited to see.|$|R
2500|$|In 1987, H. C. Sanders, {{owner of}} a nearby gas station, {{reported}} 20 years earlier {{he ran out of}} gas at night near the Red River across from the Bell Witch Cave. He began to walk towards town when a rabbit came out of the woods and began to follow him. Sanders walked faster, but the rabbit kept pace even as he broke out into a run. After a mile, Sanders sat down on a log <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> The rabbit hopped up {{on the other side of}} the log looked at him and said, [...] "Hell of a race we had there, wasn't it?" ...|$|E
2500|$|As Kilroy {{stood on}} the street, he was lured by a man parked inside a red truck who {{apparently}} called him {{and asked him if}} he needed a ride. As he got close to the vehicle, Kilroy was grabbed by two men, Serafín Hernández García and Malio Fabio Ponce Torres, and wrestled inside the truck. Because of his size and athletic strength, Kilroy was able to break loose about two blocks down the road after one of the gangsters stopped for a few moments <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Kilroy ran from the truck but was eventually intercepted by another vehicle driven by the gangsters' allies and taken at gunpoint. He was then subdued and handcuffed {{in the back of the}} second car.|$|E
60|$|Then after a {{pause in}} which <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> he let himself down to the ground.|$|E
60|$|The priest heard Lorison <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> painfully, and a {{faint smile}} flickered across his own {{clean-cut}} mouth.|$|R
6000|$|... "My gracious, this {{is getting}} at close range!" [...] burst out Dick, when he could <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> again. [...] "Uncle Randolph, they meant to kill us!" ...|$|R
60|$|The flattered {{and happy}} woman put {{her lips to}} his ear and whispered a princely name. It made him <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> it lit <b>his</b> face with exultation.|$|R
60|$|Neale paused, as {{much from}} the squeeze Allie {{suddenly}} gave him as for an instant's rest <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... “Pretty quiet around here, {{this time}} of night,” remarked Roger, as he paused <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> for they had been walking fast. “There doesn’t {{seem to be a}} soul in sight.” ...|$|E
60|$|The {{cool water}} nearly scalded {{him before he}} could swim out, but {{fortunately}} he was near the bank and he quickly scrambled upon the land and sat down <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you and Ralph safe?" [...] was the question, {{as soon as}} the {{man could}} <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> for he had been running with all the {{swiftness}} at his command.|$|R
6000|$|... "Phew! {{but that}} was a narrow escape and no mistake," [...] was the comment of the big youth, after he could <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "I thought sure he had me by the foot!" ...|$|R
50|$|Charlie {{began to}} run when he {{recognized}} the vehicle from an earlier incident. Shouting epithets, the boys gave chase. Charlie fell and because of his asthma could not <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Roy ran further down State Street and stopped and observed.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no use," [...] groaned Andy, as {{he stopped}} <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "We are stuck {{as hard as}} if we were planted here, and it looks as if we would have to remain here for some time." ...|$|E
60|$|Something seemed <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> He never {{finished}} his sentence. There was a moment's breathless and disappointed silence. If {{only he had}} known it, sympathy was almost entirely with him. Anna was no favourite at No. 13 Montague Street.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's {{the most}} trying {{experience}} I've had yet," [...] he murmured to himself, as he at last {{dropped into a}} slow walk <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "Those people are not thieves, but they are next door to it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could see}} that <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> was failing, and I bent low <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> words.|$|R
60|$|Something in {{her voice}} made Blake <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> She looked very {{alluring}} as she sat there {{with the last of}} the sunshine sprinkling gold over her hair and her face and her light gown. He leaned forward quickly; and then he remembered his disgrace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} judge, cautiously. Whatever was coming, {{he wished to}} guard himself from the mistake that he had once so nearly fallen into, and that still made him <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> <b>to</b> think of. [...] "How can I be of use to you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Reddy stopped <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> {{and gain}} time for more invention. Of all the unhappy mortals on earth Worry Arthurs looked the unhappiest. He {{believed}} every word {{as if it}} had been gospel. And that about Professor Rhodes was the last straw.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a pity we didn't have no dirt handy {{to shovel}} on," [...] he said, pausing <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> while Dan locked the shutter again. [...] "We may need this water afore we git through. How is it up thar, Ralph?" [...] he called.|$|E
60|$|He was now {{exhausted}} {{with running}} and with fighting the entangling vines, {{and had to}} halt <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> As {{he came to a}} stop he listened attentively, to learn if the men were following, but the downpour of rain drowned out every other sound.|$|E
60|$|Gilbert had {{a sudden}} vision of Anne, arrayed in a frilly green gown, with the {{virginal}} curves of arms and throat slipping out of it, and white stars shining against the coils of her ruddy hair. The vision made him <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> But he turned lightly away.|$|R
60|$|Bub Russell {{paid the}} boatman and stepped on deck. The anchor was forgotten. A mighty cheer went {{up from the}} men, and almost before he could <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> {{he was on the}} {{shoulders}} of the captain, surrounded by his mates, and endeavoring to answer twenty questions to the second.|$|R
50|$|His {{movements}} are broad and laborious, {{allowing him to}} aggressively emphasize his speech and simultaneously exhausting him. He will also get excited about something and move very quickly and deliberately, leaving him with {{no choice but to}} halt the action and <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> He is <b>to</b> {{be thought of as a}} rebellious delinquent in the body of an old man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{take any}} notice of me, for I don't deserve it. I only {{came to see}} that you were safe, Cousin, and then go hang myself, as Steve advised," [...] he began in a remorseful tone that would have been very {{effective}} if he had not been obliged <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> with a comical gasp now and then.|$|E
6000|$|... "'You {{might as}} well come out and save me the trouble of digging for you, Sonny Bunny,' Mr. Fox said, as he stopped <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> and my hair stood right up on end, for I began to {{understand}} that my little Sonny Bunny, meeting Mr. Fox on the way home, had dodged in there {{to get out of}} his way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my, Shadow! are {{you going}} to start right away?" [...] demanded Dave, with a broad grin on his face. [...] "Can't you give a fellow a chance <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath?</b> This is a great surprise--meeting you three {{on my way to the}} city. And to think we are going to be {{together}} in one of the parlor cars, too!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Barker?" [...] {{said the}} minister, {{with a cold}} thrill of instant recognition, but playing with a {{factitious}} uncertainty till he could <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> {{in the presence of}} the calamity. [...] "Oh yes! How do you do?" [...] he said; and then planting himself adventurously upon the commandment to love one's neighbour as one's-self, he added: [...] "I'm very glad to see you!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Waiting {{until the}} yard is empty and then walking unannounced to the house. The dogs run outside and tackle the cat. This time, Sylvester gets away, {{but before he}} can <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> a kindly old man - {{thinking}} the puddy had simply wandered outside his home - throws {{him back into the}} yard, where the dogs beat the cat up some more.|$|R
60|$|He drew {{himself up}} with a sharp <b>catch</b> in <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> {{and stared at her}} as if he saw a ghost.|$|R
