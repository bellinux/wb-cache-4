40|$|We propose an {{approach}} for representing an object by its constituent parts and their spatial connections. The approach {{is based on}} a set of primitive volumes called geons.

The three-dimensional geometrical information at <b>T</b> <b>junctions</b> allows us to group pairs of corresponding <b>T</b> <b>junctions.</b> By following occluding, limb, concave edges and linking pairs of corresponding <b>T</b> <b>junctions,</b> we decompose the edge-junction graph into different subgraphs.

40|$|AbstractThe {{remarkable}} regularity of {{the rock}} columns outlined by the cooling related contraction joints in lava flows at sites such as the Giant's Causeway, Ireland, Fingal's Cave, Scotland and the Devil's Postpile, California is well known. Columnar joints are the only system of natural fractures to approach an optimal hexagonal honeycomb-like pattern. 3 -connected vertices in near-surface natural-fracture networks are almost exclusively orthogonal “T-type” junctions. Columnar joints owe their unique quasihexagonal symmetry and the prevalence of six-sided columns {{to the presence of}} “Y” junctions. Initially, the cooling-related fracture network at the upper and lower surfaces of a flow are dominated by <b>T</b> <b>junctions</b> and are similar in appearance to mudcrack patterns. However, as the tips of these cracks grow towards the center of the flow to relieve the thermal strain which develops there during cooling, the poorly positioned ones are eliminated or modified to yield a more regular network dominated by Y rather than <b>T</b> <b>junctions...</b>|$|R

It appeared that the passenger car {{was the most important}} collision type involved in the 479 accidents.

The difficulties experienced by older cyclists mainly relate with the manoeuvres of crossing or turning to the left at the junction.

To elucidate the mechanism of cell body translocation, we analyzed the supramolecular organization of the actin–myosin II system and the dynamics of myosin II in fish epidermal keratocytes. In lamellipodia, long actin filaments formed dense networks with numerous free ends in a brushlike manner near the leading edge. Shorter actin filaments often formed <b>T</b> <b>junctions</b> with longer filaments in the brushlike area, suggesting that new filaments could be nucleated at sides of preexisting filaments or linked to them immediately after nucleation.

We have investigated the effect of gas feed ratio R (=NH 3 /B 2 H 6) in the plasma reaction chamber, keeping all other deposition parameters constant, on the morphology of boron nitride films. The deposited films are characterized by SEM, AFM, TEM and Laser Raman. For gas feed ratio, R 100, size of the crystallites reduces to nanometer level.
