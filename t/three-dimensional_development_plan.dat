Most of {{the less}} {{developed}} countries are engaging in development projects to address the development needs of their citizens. Yet the record of success of these projects is not high. The ‘crisis in development planning’ has been under scrutiny for some time so that ways may be found of improving the <b>development</b> <b>planning</b> process. <b>Development</b> <b>planning</b> requires reliable quantities of information of an acceptable quality. In particular geo-spatial information {{should be used in}} <b>development</b> <b>planning.</b> However, there is evidence of poor usage of geo-spatial information in <b>development</b> <b>planning.</b> There is a need to review the <b>development</b> <b>planning</b> process, in particular the decision-making process, particularly where information and knowledge are used. A proposed new <b>development</b> <b>planning</b> process is presented, emphasizing the role of information and knowledge, as well as capacity and capacity-building in a community participative process. From evidence presented in this research it is concluded that there is a significant relationship between geo-spatial information and <b>development</b> <b>planning.</b> A Geo-spatial Information Decision-making Model is developed, emphasizing the relationship between geo-spatial information, spatial knowledge and the decision-making process within the environment of the <b>development</b> <b>planning</b> process. This is an information / knowledge-centric model, with the objective of optimizing rationality in the decision-making process [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Risk-sensitive {{development}} {{is an essential}} component of building resilient communities. It provides an opportunity for sustaining development investment as well as reducing future risks at community level. <b>Development</b> <b>plans</b> should integrate disaster and climate risk information systematically, to overcome increasing challenges of disaster and climate risks and to optimise the use of resources for effective delivery of development outcomes. While <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> identify needs and priorities of communities, the process of formulating <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> itself intends to empower communities. Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) integrated development strategies will enable state and non-state stakeholders to implement risk-informed actions in disaster prone areas. Formulation of risk-sensitive village and regional <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> has been promoted in the recent Community Resilience Framework of Sri Lanka. This paper presents an approach and process in developing risk-sensitive <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> in a pilot project in the Northern Sri Lanka moving from stand-alone DRR initiatives to risk-sensitive development. Key lessons from the pilot project include: involvement of local authorities from the outset of the risk-sensitive <b>development</b> <b>planning</b> process; formulating a system to monitor the complete risk-sensitive <b>development</b> <b>planning</b> process; and creating a community of practice to promote risk-sensitive <b>development</b> <b>planning</b> at divisional level for future upscaling...|$|R

Considering the past thirty four years from the establishment of the UDA, 218 urban development areas have been declared and only 42 <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> have been gazette up to October 2012. Some <b>Development</b> <b>plans</b> have taken more than twenty years for the preparation. There is an immense duration gap between the data collection and the finalization of the plan. In this attempt government spends millions of rupees for the preparation of urban <b>development</b> <b>plan.</b> However it is experienced that those <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> have been taken many years for the preparation after the declaration. Furthermore, these <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> are used many resources and have not come up implementation and enforcement due to various reasons. The causes for this situation have been discovered by the study as the effect of adequacy of contextual factors and less guidance for implementation such as less understanding on data collection and use, lack of proper time management staff involvement in the planning process, lack of political acceptability and support for plan making and implementation, less coordination among the private and the government agencies who involved plan preparation.
