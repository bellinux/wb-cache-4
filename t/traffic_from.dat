5|$|A four-lane {{bridge is}} {{estimated}} to cost NOK2 billion. It could either be located immediately north of the current bridge, or south of Norwegian Talc.

Without a bypass, the increased capacity from Sotra would not be achieved without expanding the motorway from Storavatnet to the city center. In 2010, an alternative was launched whereby a four-lane bridge would be built south of Norwegian Talc, and would immediately run into a tunnel and connect to the current motorway at Liavatnet. This is the planned intersection between National Road 555 and County Road 557 (Ring Road West), which would result in <b>traffic</b> <b>from</b> Sotra towards southern Bergen would not take up capacity on the current 555 motorway until after <b>traffic</b> <b>from</b> both Sotra and Askøy heading towards southern Bergen have had a possibility to head onto County Road 557.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} approach takes <b>traffic</b> <b>from</b> the A12 and {{the southern}} approach takes <b>traffic</b> <b>from</b> the A2, making the tunnel crossing a key link for both local and longer-distance traffic {{between the north and}} south sides of the river. It forms part of a key route into Central London from South East London and Kent and was the easternmost all-day crossing for vehicles before the opening of the Dartford Tunnel in 1963. It remains the easternmost free fixed road crossing of the Thames, and regularly suffers congestion, to the extent that tidal flow schemes were in place from 1978 until controversially removed in 2007. Proposals to solve the traffic problems have included building a third bore, constructing alternative crossings of the Thames such as the now cancelled Thames Gateway Bridge or the Silvertown Tunnel, and providing better traffic management, particularly for heavy goods vehicles.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} topic of ‘trafficking’ in women for the sex sector in Europe. The term trafficking is usually intended to signify transportation of persons by means of coercion or deception into exploitative and slavery-like conditions. I approach the theme of <b>trafficking</b> <b>from</b> the perspective of women from ‘eastern’ Europe ‘trafficked’ into street prostitution to ‘western’ 3 Europe. Taking as its starting point the accounts {{of women who have}} reached Italy though trafficking networks, this dissertation critically assesses the conceptualisation of trafficking in the fields of current academic and political discourses. In particular, my work engages and challenges the categories of ‘victim’ and ‘organized crime’ as the main analytic framework within which trafficking is commonly discussed and researched. I propose instead to approach <b>trafficking</b> <b>from</b> the perspective of migration. Examining <b>trafficking</b> <b>from</b> the migration perspective allows, as I show in this dissertation, to broaden the interpretative framework as to propose a more nuanced analysis able to account for the complexities of the trafficking process...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the battle}} waged for {{possession}} of it, the railroad had not been very profitable.

Shellenberger installed a rock crusher atop the mountain, which also provided revenue. A major forest fire destroyed both the Wopsononock Hotel and the coal tipple at Dougherty on April 30, 1903. When the railroad became insolvent again, Shellenberger was appointed receiver on June 4, 1909. It was once more sold under foreclosure on April 30, 1910 to H.A. Davis, and reorganized as the Altoona, Juniata and Northern Railway.|$|E
