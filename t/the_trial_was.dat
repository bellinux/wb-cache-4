5|$|The often uproarious and {{spectacular}} Cuocolo trial attracted {{a lot of}} attention of newspapers and the general public both in Italy {{as well as in the}} United States, including by Pathé's Gazette. <b>The</b> <b>trial</b> <b>was</b> transformed from a murder trial into one against the Camorra as a whole. The hearings began in the spring of 1911 and would continue for twelve months. Fabbroni intended to use the trial to strike the final blow to the Camorra. <b>The</b> <b>trial</b> <b>was</b> attended by the former mayor of New York City, George B. McClellan, in whose administration Petrosino was killed.|$|E

5|$|Adelaide's first {{experiment}} with electric powered trams was a demonstration {{run on the}} Adelaide and Hindmarsh Tramway company's line.

5|$|As this {{statement}} was not true, Alvarez was indicted {{for violating the}} Stolen Valor Act.

5|$|Back in Italy, Alfano stood {{trial at}} Viterbo for the Cuocolo murders. On March 27, 1909, the Assistant Public Prosecutor {{committed}} 47 persons for trial by the Court of Assizes in Naples.

5|$|Burr {{was quickly}} called to Canada's Naval Services Headquarters {{to discuss how}} to apply {{diffused}} lighting camouflage. Simple tests in the laboratory served as proof of concept. In January 1941, sea trials began on the new corvette HMCS Cobalt. She was fitted with ordinary light projectors—neither designed for robustness, nor waterproofed—on temporary supports {{on one side of}} the hull; brightness was controlled manually. <b>The</b> <b>trial</b> <b>was</b> sufficiently promising for a better prototype to be developed.|$|E
50|$|Woetzel’s {{doctoral}} dissertation, on {{the legality}} of <b>the</b> Nuremberg <b>trials,</b> <b>was</b> published as <b>The</b> Nuremberg <b>Trials</b> in International Law.

5|$|Caragiale had by then {{proceeded}} to research the matter on his own, {{and came to the}} independent conclusion that the accusations were entirely concocted. Late in 1901, he opened a legal case against both Caion and Stoenescu, taken up by the Ilfov County court. On the first day, Caion excused himself as sick, while Stoenescu recused himself, taking the prosecution's side. For these reasons, <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>was</b> held without a jury.|$|E
5|$|Each man was {{subsequently}} released August 10 on $3,000 bail. The charge of murder was later amended to manslaughter by {{the grand jury}} indictment. <b>The</b> <b>trial</b> <b>was</b> convened November 26 under Judge Harding, with the widow of Patrick Langan, one of those slain on August 1, named as prosecutor. Of the 20 subpoenaed by the prosecution to {{bear witness to the}} peaceful nature of the protest, only six appeared to testify. Three admitted to seeing violence committed by the mob prior to the shooting. Many more testified on behalf of the accused.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, Gröning {{was charged}} by German {{prosecutors}} as {{an accessory to}} murder, in 300,000 cases, for his role at the Auschwitz concentration camp.

5|$|On May 11, a {{grand jury}} was {{assembled}} in McLennan County and quickly returned an indictment against Washington; <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>was</b> scheduled for May 15. The Times-Herald of Waco published a notice on May 12 requesting that residents let the justice system determine Washington's fate. Fleming traveled to Robinson on May 13 to ask residents to remain calm; his address was well received. Washington was assigned several inexperienced lawyers. His lawyers prepared no defense, and noted that he appeared placid {{in the days before}} the trial.|$|E
5|$|On May 24, Judge Singleterry heard {{arguments}} from the plaintiff {{and the defense}} on the request for the change of venue. On June 7, he denied {{a request for a}} change of venue after considering that the defendant failed to prove that there was prejudice against him in the Hidalgo community. On July 19, Feit appeared in court for a prehearing. <b>The</b> <b>trial</b> <b>was</b> expected to place on September 11. However, on September 10, the court decided to push the trial due to scheduling conflicts with one of the attorneys and because of delays in another high-profile case in the Hidalgo County. Feit appeared in court on September 11 – for the first time without prison uniform – expecting to face trial that week. The initial phase of jury selection was done in mid-September; <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>was</b> pushed for mid-October.|$|E
5|$|Once in Buenos Aires, Castelli {{found himself}} in {{political}} isolation. The triumvirate and the newspaper La Gazeta blamed him for the defeat at Huaqui, and sought punishment as a deterrent. His former supporters were divided between those who supported {{the ideas of the}} Triumvirate and those no longer able to help. Castelli suffered from tongue cancer during the long trial, which made it progressively more difficult for him to speak. He died on October 12, 1812, while <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> <b>was</b> still underway.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> Nuremberg <b>trials</b> (...) <b>were</b> {{a series}} of {{military}} tribunals held by the Allied forces under international law {{and the laws of}} war after World War II. <b>The</b> <b>trials</b> <b>were</b> most notable for the prosecution of prominent members of the political, military, judicial and economic leadership of Nazi Germany, who planned, carried out, or otherwise participated in the Holocaust and other war crimes. <b>The</b> <b>trials</b> <b>were</b> held in <b>the</b> city of Nuremberg, Germany, and their decisions marked a turning point between classical and contemporary international law.|$|R

5|$|Pilecki's show {{trial and}} {{execution}} {{was part of}} a wider campaign of repression against former Home Army members and others connected with the Polish Government-in-Exile in London. In 2003, the prosecutor, Czesław Łapiński, and several others involved in the trial were charged with complicity in Pilecki's murder.

5|$|The first prosecutions in {{relation}} to the riot began at Manchester Crown Court on 14 January 1992. <b>The</b> <b>trial</b> <b>was</b> conducted amid tight security, including armed police patrolling the area around the court, body searches for spectators and a specially constructed dock with sides made from bulletproof glass. Nine men went on trial charged with riot under Section 1 of the Public Order Act 1986, with six of them, including Paul Taylor and Alan Lord, also being charged with the murder of Derek White.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>trial</b> <b>was</b> {{postponed}} until January 17 because Jackalow's counsel was not {{served with}} the list of names of the jurors until the morning of January 15, and federal law required that the panel be served two full days before trial. The government planned to call 34 witnesses, and to pay each $500 for their time. Jackalow moved to compel the attendance of Dr. Theodore R. Vanck, Robert J. Dalton, and Professor George Hammell Cook of Rutgers College. Voorhees and Wilson represented Jackalow, and the prosecution was conducted by U.S. Attorney Cannon and Andrew Dutcher.|$|E
50|$|In a {{randomized}} trial with two treatment groups, group sequential testing may for example {{be conducted in}} the following manner: After n subjects in each group, are available, an interim analysis is conducted.

Otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> continues. Another n subjects per group are recruited. The statistical test is performed again, including all subjects.
