40|$|A {{mathematical}} model for nonrandom generalized transduction is proposed and analyzed. The model {{takes into account}} the finite number of <b>transducing</b> <b>particle</b> classes for any given marker. The equations for estimation of the distance between markers from cotransduction frequency data are derived and standard errors of the estimates are given. The obtained relationships depend significantly on the number of classes of transducing fragments. The model was applied to estimate the number of transducing fragment classes for a given marker in transduction with phage P 22 of Salmonella typhimurium. It was found that the literature data on frequencies of cotransduction in crosses with mutual substitution of selective and nonselective markers can be rationalized most accurately by assuming that the mean number of classes is equal to 2. An improved method for analysis of cotransduction data is proposed on the basis of our model and the results of calculation. The method relies on solving a set of algebraic equations for cotransduction frequencies of markers located within one phage length. The method allows a relatively precise determination of distances between markers, positions of <b>transducing</b> <b>particle</b> ends and deletion or insertion lengths. The approach is applied to the trp-cysB-pyrF and aroC-hisT-purF-dhuA regions of the Salmonella typhimurium chromosome...|$|E

40|$|The {{temperate}} bacteriophage P 22 mediates both generalized {{and specialized}} transduction in Salmonella typhimurium. Specialized transduction by phage P 22 is different from, and less restricted than, the well characterized specialized transduction by phage lambda, due {{to differences in}} the phage DNA packaging mechanisms. Based on the properties of the DNA packaging mechanism of phage P 22 a model for the generation of various types of specialized <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> is presented that suggests generation of substantial numbers of specialized transducing genomes which are heterogeneous but only some of which have terminally redundant ends. The primary attachment site, ataA, for phage P 22 in S. typhimurium is located between the genes proA,B and supQ newD. (The newD gene is a substitute gene for the leuD gene, restoring leucine prototrophy of leuD mutant strains.) The proA,B and supQ newD genes are very closely linked and thus cotransducible by generalized <b>transducing</b> <b>particles.</b> Specialized <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> can carry either proA,B or supQ newD but not both simultaneously, and thus cannot give rise to cotransduction of the proA,B and supQ newD genes. This difference is used to calculate the frequency of generalized and specialized <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> from the observed cotransduction frequency in phage lysates. By this method, very high frequencies of supQ newD (10 (- 2) /PFU) - and proA,B (10 (- 3) /PFU) -specialized <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> were detected in lysates produced by induction of lysogenic strains.

Specialized transduction by phage P 22 is different from, and less restricted than, the well characterized specialized transduction by phage lambda, due {{to differences in}} the phage DNA packaging mechanism. Phage lysates produced by induction of lysogenic strains contain very high frequencies of supQ newD- and proA,B-specialized <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> (10 (- 2) /PFU and 10 (- 3) /PFU, respectively), most of which are produced by independent aberrant excision events of various types. In a model, 12 different modes of transduction mechanisms were characterized by: (i) the structure of the specialized transducing genomes after injection into a new host cell, i. e., linear or circular, and (ii) the requirements for the transduction process, i. e., host recombination functions, phage integration functions, or presence of a prophage. By using different recipient strains and phage helper strains, it was possible to show that most specialized <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> (ca. 99 %) contain linear genomes that cannot circularize upon injection into a new host cell and that require the presence of an integrated prophage as a site for a recombinational event to give rise to a transductant. Only 0. 1 % of all specialized <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> were shown to transduce by integration, suggesting that transducing genomes containing terminally redundant ends represent only a minor fraction of all <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> that are produced. However, {{it should be pointed out}} that the frequency (approximately 10 (- 5) /PFU) of these specialized transducing genomes that can circularize upon injection into a new host cell is as high as or even higher than the frequency of specialized <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> of phage lambda.

40|$|Buoyant density {{analysis}} of transducing lysates derived from Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli indicated that phage particles bearing plasmid determinants contain {{a quantity of}} DNA equivalent to that found in the lytic <b>particles.</b> <b>Transducing</b> <b>particles</b> that bear plasmid determinants smaller than viral DNA must therefore contain a quantity of DNA in excess of a single plasmid genome. In the E. coli P 1 vir system, a dependence upon host-mediated recombination for the transduction of small plasmids, but not for large R factors or chromosomal genes, was observed. However, no evidence for the involvement of such functions in the transduction of S. aureus plasmids was obtained. Although {{the origin of the}} additional DNA in plasmid <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> has not been identified, circumstantial evidence has been presented in the staphylococcal system indicating that <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> carrying a small tetracycline plasmid are not formed by the wrapping of multiple copies of this plasmid DNA...|$|R
40|$|Salmonella typhimurium {{bacteriophage}} P 22 transduced plasmids having P 22 sequences {{inserted in}} the vector pBR 322 with high frequency. Analysis {{of the structure of}} the <b>transducing</b> <b>particle</b> DNA and the transduced plasmids indicates that this plasmid transduction involves two homologous recombination events. In the donor cell, a single recombination between the phage and the homologous sequences on the plasmid inserted the plasmid into the phage chromosome, which was then packaged by headfuls into P 22 particles. The <b>transducing</b> <b>particle</b> DNA contained duplications of the region of homology flanking the integrated plasmid vector sequences and lacked some phage genes. When these defective phage genomes containing the inserted plasmid infected a recipient cell, recombination between the duplicated regions regenerated the plasmid. A useful consequence of this sequence of events was that genetic markers in the region of homology were readily transferred from phage to plasmid. Plasmid transduction required homology between the phage and the plasmid, but did not depend on the presence of any specific P 22 sequence in the plasmid. When the infecting P 22 carried a DNA sequence homologous to the ampicillin resistance region of pBR 322, the vector plasmid having no P 22 insert could be transduced. P 22 -mediated transduction is a useful way to transfer chimeric plasmids, since most S. typhimurium strains are poorly transformed by plasmid DNA...|$|E
40|$|Transcriptional fusions to Salmonella typhimurium {{chromosomal}} genes {{were constructed}} by integration of a suicide fusion vector into the chromosome by homologous recombination with random cloned chromosomal fragments. We describe here a transductional method using the generalized transducing phage of S. typhimurium, P 22, to clone these fusions {{directly from the}} bacterial chromosome, in a single step, {{without the use of}} restriction enzymes. In this transduction, the phage packages the chromosomal fragment containing the integrated plasmid. Once introduced into the recipient, the plasmid circularizes by homologous recombination between the duplicated region determined by the cloned fragment. Although RecA mediates the majority of these events, the plasmid can circularize in a recA recipient. However, in this case, the event occurs at a much lower frequency and only when the transduction is done at a high multiplicity of infection. In addition to integrated fusion constructs, we also show that autonomously replicating low-copy-number plasmids can be transduced. In this case, transduction is dependent on homologous recombination between the plasmid and the donor chromosome via cloned sequences, in which the <b>transducing</b> <b>particle</b> effectively traps the integrated plasmid...|$|E
40|$|Generalized {{transduction}} by bacteriophage P 22 occurs by {{the transfer}} of DNA from one bacterium to another {{by means of a}} phage-like particle (i. e. a <b>transducing</b> <b>particle)</b> which contains bacterial DNA formed before infection (preceding paper). Transduction of a 3 aP-labeled, light recipient with purified transducing particles whose DNA is labeled with 3 H, zH, 16 N, 13 C results in the physical association of 12 to 15 % of the transducing DNA with the DNA of the recipient bacteria. The remainder of the transducing DNA persists as unreplicated phage-size fragments during further bacterial growth. Physical and genetic analysis of the DNA integrated as large fragments reveals that recombination in generalized transduction occurs by a displacement mechanism, often resulting in the integration of double strand fragments of transducing DNA into the DNA of the recipient bacteria. The molecular weight of most of the large integrated fragments is greater than 2 to 4 x IO 8 daltons but substantially less than 27 x lo 6 daltons, the molecular weight of the transducing DNA injected into the bacteria. The integrated large double strand fragments of transducing DNA can be detected in DNA isolated soon after transduction, but not in DNA isolated late after transduction, when the transductants have been permitted to replicate. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{generalized}} transducing bacteriophage of Salmonella typhimurium, P 22, can transduce plasmids {{in addition}} to chromosomal markers. Previous studies have concentrated on transduction of pBR 322 by P 22 and P 22 HT, the high transducing mutant of P 22. This study investigates the mechanism of P 22 HT transduction of low-copy number plasmids, namely pSC 101 derivatives. We show that P 22 HT transduces pSC 101 derivatives that share homology with the chromosome by two distinct mechanisms. In the first mechanism, the plasmid integrates into the chromosome of the donor by homologous recombination. This chromosomal fragment is then packaged in the <b>transducing</b> <b>particle.</b> The second mechanism is a size-dependent mechanism involving a putative plasmid multimer. We propose that this multimer is formed by interplasmidic recombination. In contrast, P 22 HT can efficiently transduce pBR 322 by a third mechanism, which is independent of plasmid homology with the chromosome. It has been proposed that the phage packages a linear concatemer created during rolling circle replication of pBR 322, similar in fashion to phage genome packaging. This study investigates the role of RecA, RecD, and RecF recombination proteins in plasmid/plasmid and plasmid/chromosome interactions that form packageable substrates in the donor. We also examine the resolution of various transduced plasmid species in the recipient and the roles of RecA and RecD in these processes...|$|E
40|$|Study {{of many of}} the {{interesting}} properties of Klebsiella aerogenes is limited by the lack of a well-characterized genetic system for this organism. Our investigations of the evolution of the enzyme ribitol dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 56) in K. aerogenes would be greatly facilitated by the availability of such a system, and we here report two approaches to developing one. We have isolated mutants sensitive to the coliphage P 1, which will efficiently tranduce genetic markers between such sensitive strains and which will thus make detailed mapping studies possible. Derivatives of K. aerogenes lysogenic for P 1 can be readily isolated by using the specialized <b>transducing</b> <b>particle</b> P 1 CMclr 100. Bacteria lysogenic for this phage are chloramphenicol resistant and temperature sensitive. Phage particles produced by temperature induction of such lysogens can be used to transfer K. aerogenes genes to the natural host of P 1 phage. Escherichia coli. We have used this method to prepare derivatives of E. coli K- 12 carrying the K. aerogenes genes conferring the ability to metabolize the pentitols ribitol and D-arabitol. We have shown that these E. coli-K. aerogenes hybrids synthesize a ribitol dehydrogenase with the properties of the K. aerogenes enzyme and have mapped the position of the transferred gene on the E. coli chromosome. The ramifications of this methodology are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A new {{generalized}} transducing bacteriophage in the Escherichia coli {{system was}} isolated and characterized. This phage, designated D 108, makes clear plaques on E. coli K- 10, K- 12, K- 12 (P 1 kc), K- 12 (D 6), B/r, C, and 15 T−, and Shigella dysenteriae. The plaque of phage D 108 is larger in size {{than that of}} phage P 1 kc. Electron-microscopic observation revealed that phages D 108 and P 1 kc are morphologically different from each other, suggesting that phage D 108 belongs to a phage group different from phage P 1. The fact {{that all of the}} 10 markers tested were transduced by phage D 108 indicates that this phage is a generalized transducing phage in the E. coli system. The transduction frequency by phage D 108 of chromosomal markers and of a drug resistance factor (R factor) ranged from 2 × 10 − 6 to 3 × 10 − 8 and 3 × 10 − 9 to 6 × 10 − 10 per phage, respectively. The cotransduction frequency of the thr and leu markers was 2. 8 % for phage P 1 kc and 1. 5 % for phage D 108. The CM and TC markers (chloramphenicol-resistant and tetracycline-resistant markers, respectively) of the R factor were not cotransduced by phage D 108, but the markers were generally cotransduced by phage P 1 kc. The results suggest that the <b>transducing</b> <b>particle</b> of phage D 108 contains a smaller amount of host deoxyribonucleic acid than does phage P 1 kc...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine whether the transducing phage Pl picks up original bacterial chromosome segments and whether these segments are always the same size. The plan of approach was to grow the donor bacteria Escherichia coli C 600 gal⁺ (galactose) in minimal media containing the heavy isotopes ¹⁵nitrogen and deuterium in place of light nitrogen and hydrogen. The heavy isotopes were incorporated into the chromosomes of the donors which were infected with light Pl and allowed to lyse in light media. As a result, only <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> contained the heavy DNA picked up from the chromosome.

On a graph plotted of titer versus drop number, three peaks were evident: active Pl, transducing Pl, and c 2. The peak of the <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> was cone-shaped and denser than the peak of active Pl, indicating the following: (1) original heavy chromosome material was incorporated into all the transducing particles; (2) none of the chromosome fragments had replicated, since no half-heavy or light <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> were found; (3) all chromosome fragments were the same size or very nearly the same size...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} for mapping {{mutations}} in the Salmonella typhimurium chromosome is described {{and applied to}} the localization of novel regulatory mutations affecting expression of the nirB (nitrite reductase) gene. The mapping technique is also illustrated by the mapping of mutations in genes affecting carbohydrate catabolism and biosynthetic pathways. The new mapping method involves use of the hybrid phage MudP and MudQ (together referred to as Mud-P 22), originally constructed by Youderian et al. (Genetics 118 : 581 - 592, 1988). This report describes a set of Mud-P 22 lysogens, {{each member of the}} set containing a different Mud-P 22 insertion. The insertions are scattered along the entire Salmonella genome. These lysogens, when induced by mitomycin C, generate transducing lysates that are enriched (45 - to 1, 400 -fold over the background, generalized <b>transducing</b> <b>particle</b> population) for transducing particles containing bacterial DNA that flanks one side of the insertion. We demonstrate that within the set of lysogens there can be found at least one Mud-P 22 insertion that enriches for any particular region of the Salmonella chromosome and that, therefore, all regions of the chromosome are discretely enriched and represented by the collection as a whole. We describe a technique that allows the rapid and facile determination of which lysate contains enriched sequences for the repair of a mutant locus, thereby allowing the determination of the map position of the locus. This technique is applicable to those mutations for which the wild-type allele is selectable.

Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} the <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> have virions with tails that appear identical to those of helper phage 80 α but have smaller capsids, commensurate with the smaller genome of the SaPI (Lindsay et. al., 1998). The morphology of the <b>transducing</b> <b>particles,</b> coupled with the observation that the genomic sequence of SaPIl (GenBank U 93688) does not reveal any obvious phage structural proteins, has led to the hypothesis that SaPIl is encapsidated in a virion comprised of 80 α structural proteins. Analysis of SaPIl <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> supports this hypothesis. Further investigation of 80 α genes involved in SaPI 1 mobilization was accomplished by selection of phage mutants resistant to SaPI 1 interference. Two classes of SaPI 1 jnterference resistant (sir) mutants were obtained, and point mutations were identified in two adjacent genes. In order to confirm the roles of these genes, an in-frame deletion of each candidate gene was constructed in an 80 α prophage. All mutant phage and deletion constructs were evaluated for phage replication, SaPI 1 replication, SaPIl transduction and SaPI 1 interference. One gene (ORF 21) was required for 80 α growth and replication, but was not required for SaPIl growth or replication.

In phage lysates, plaque-forming <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> were directly demonstrated while non-plaque-forming particles were only detected indirectly via complementation of defective lysogenic transductants. In the defective transductants, the two distal ends of the vegetative phage map were lacking. By plasmid transfer, the attachment site of phage 16 - 3 was located close to the cys- 46 and met- 5 markers. Transduction of the met- 5 marker could not be demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|A segment (hft) of {{bacteriophage}} FP 43 DNA cloned into plasmid pIJ 702 mediated high-frequency transduction of {{the resulting}} plasmid (pRHB 101) by FP 43 in Streptomyces griseofuscus. The <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> contained linear concatemers of plasmid DNA. Lysates of FP 43 prepared on S. griseofuscus containing pRHB 101 also transduced many other Streptomyces species, including several that restrict plaque formation by FP 43 {{and at least two}} that produce restriction endonucleases that cut pRHB 101 DNA. Transduction efficiencies in different species were influenced by the addition of anti-FP 43 antiserum to the transduction plates, the temperature for cell growth before transduction, the multiplicity of infection, and the host on which the transducing lysate was prepared. FP 43 lysates prepared on S. griseofuscus(pRHB 101) also transduced species of Streptoverticillium, Chainia, and Saccharopolyspora...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacteriophage}} Φγ, though {{related to}} the lambdoid phage ϕ 80, has unusual features in its specialized transduction and is being investigated to determine the mechanism of the transduction process. Genetic analysis of the transducing element gives evidence for a relatively long and uniform linear segment, up to about 1 % of the E. coli chromosome, extending in either direction from the prophage attachment site, e. g., on the right side: att 80 -tonB-trpABCDE-cysB-pryF.

In {{a small fraction of}} the <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> the phage segment may be more extensive and, conversely, the bacterial segment is shorter, ending around cysB.

40|$|Adenoviral vectors {{are widely}} used as highly {{efficient}} gene transfer vehicles {{in a variety of}} biological research strategies including human gene therapy. One of the limitations of the currently available adenoviral vector system is the presence {{of the majority of the}} viral genome in the vector, resulting in leaky expression of viral genes particularly at high multiplicity of infection and limited cloning capacity of exogenous sequences. As a first step to overcome this problem, we attempted to rescue a defective human adenovirus serotype 5 DNA, which had an essential region of the viral genome (L 1, L 2, VAI + II, pTP) deleted and replaced with an indicator gene. In the presence of wild-type adenovirus as a helper, this DNA was packaged and propagated as <b>transducing</b> viral <b>particles.</b> After several rounds of amplification, the titer of the recombinant virus reached at least 4 x 10 (6) <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> per ml. The recombinant virus could be partially purified from the helper virus by CsCl equilibrium density-gradient centrifugation. The structure of the recombinant virus around the marker gene remained intact after serial propagation, while the pBR sequence inserted in the E 1 region was deleted from the recombinant virus. Our results suggest that it should be possible to develop a helper-dependent adenoviral vector, which does not encode any viral proteins, as an alternative to the currently available adenoviral vector systems...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMolecular piracy is a {{biological}} phenomenon {{in which one}} replicon (the pirate) uses the structural proteins encoded by another replicon (the helper) to package its own genome and thus allow its propagation and spread. Such piracy is dependent on a complex web of interactions between the helper and the pirate that occur at several levels, from transcriptional control to macromolecular assembly. The best characterized examples of molecular piracy are from the E. coli P 2 /P 4 system and the S. aureus SaPI pathogenicity island/helper system. In both of these cases, the pirate element is mobilized and packaged into phage-like <b>transducing</b> <b>particles</b> assembled from proteins supplied by a helper phage that belongs to the Caudovirales order of viruses (tailed, dsDNA bacteriophages). In this review we will summarize and compare the processes {{that are involved in}} molecular piracy in these two systems...|$|R

40|$|Prophages are {{quiescent}} viruses {{located in}} the chromosomes of bacteria. In the human pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus, prophages are omnipresent and {{are believed to be}} responsible for the spread of some antibiotic resistance genes. Here we demonstrate that release of phages from a subpopulation of S. aureus cells enables the intact, prophage-containing population to acquire beneficial genes from competing, phage-susceptible strains present in the same environment. Phage infection kills competitor cells and bits of their DNA are occasionally captured in viral <b>transducing</b> <b>particles.</b> Return of such particles to the prophagecontaining population can drive the transfer of genes encoding potentially useful traits such as antibiotic resistance. This process, which can be viewed as ‘auto-transduction’, allows S. aureus to efficiently acquire antibiotic resistance both in vitro and in an in vivo virulence model (wax moth larvae) and enables it to proliferate under strong antibiotic selection pressure. Our results may help to explain the rapid exchange of antibiotic resistance genes observed in S. aureus...|$|R
