5|$|Santa María de la Cabeza castle is {{a colonial}} castle built in <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century</b> by the Spanish monarchy {{in the center}} of the city of Cumaná, Venezuela. It was built as a {{replacement}} for the San Antonio de la Eminencia castle. Its construction was ordered by Sancho Fernando de Angulo y Sandoval, governor of the Province of Cumaná. The building was designed using the trace italienne style popular during <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century,</b> with a proportional geometric floor design. Bastions were used as the main defensive elements. The castle housed a garrison of 250 soldiers, and was the seat of government for the Province of Cumaná.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of its {{ownership}} changes the building has been considerably altered, with only the east and south wings retaining their original appearance.

5|$|Scottish Protestantism {{was focused}} on the Bible, which was seen as infallible and the major source of moral authority. Many Bibles were large, {{illustrated}} and highly valuable objects. In {{the early part of the}} century the Genevan translation was commonly used. In 1611 the Kirk adopted the Authorised King James Version and the first Scots version was printed in Scotland in 1633, but the Geneva Bible continued to be employed into <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century.</b> Bibles often became the subject of superstitions, being used in divination. Family worship was strongly encouraged by the Covenanters. Books of devotion were distributed to encourage the practice and ministers were encouraged to investigate whether this was being carried out. <b>The</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century</b> marked the high-water mark of kirk discipline. Kirk sessions were able to apply religious sanctions, such as excommunication and denial of baptism, to enforce godly behaviour and obedience. In more difficult cases of immoral behaviour they could work with the local magistrate, in a system modelled on that employed in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavation}} yielded no finds, {{and thus}} it produced no means of reliably dating {{the construction of the}} site. Wainwright suggested that the ring was Early Bronze Age on the basis of other, dated circles in Britain. Based on his analysis of the site's stratigraphy, he argued that the stones had likely been removed from their original position amid agricultural development {{in the second half of}} <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{provenance}} of {{the manuscript}} before <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century</b> is unclear. From a signature on the flyleaf {{we know that it}} was in van Vliet's collection in 1659. It was auctioned in 1666, after his death, and probably was purchased by Franciscus Junius, from whose library it came to the Bodleian as part of the Junius donation (Holt 1878, pp. liv–lvi).|$|E

5|$|Women {{had limited}} access to formal {{education}} and girls benefited less than boys from {{the expansion of the}} parish school system. Some women were taught reading, domestic tasks, but often not writing. In noble households some received a private education and some female literary figures emerged from <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century.</b> Religion may have been particularly important as a means of expression for women and from <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century</b> women may have had greater opportunities for religious participation in movements outside of the established kirk. Women had very little legal status {{at the beginning of the}} period, unable to act as witnesses or legally responsible for their own actions. From the mid-sixteenth century they were increasingly criminalised, with statutes allowing them to be prosecuted for infanticide and as witches. Seventy-five per cent of an estimated 6,000 individuals prosecuted for witchcraft between 1563 and 1736 were women and perhaps 1,500 were executed. As a result, some historians have seen this period as characterised by increasing concern with women and attempts to control and constrain them.|$|E
5|$|According to Anne Feldhaus, the Morgaon temple {{does not}} pre-date <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century,</b> when Morya Gosavi popularized it. However, even the dating of Morya Gosavi is disputed and varies from the 13th–14th {{century to the}} 17th century. The {{descendants}} of Morya Gosavi – who were worshipped as Ganesha incarnates at the Chinchwad temple – often visited the Morgaon temple and controlled the finances and administration of many Ashthavinayak temples. The 17th-century saint Samarth Ramdas composed the popular arati song Sukhakarta Dukhaharta, seeing the Morgaon icon.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, most Russian churches from before the Petrine period had bulbous domes. The largest onion domes were erected in <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century</b> in the area around Yaroslavl, {{incidentally}} famous for its large onions. Quite a few had more complicated bud-shaped domes, whose form derived from Baroque models of the late seventeenth century. Pear-shaped domes are usually associated with Ukrainian Baroque, while cone-shaped domes are typical for Orthodox churches of Transcaucasia.|$|E
50|$|The Château de Ternay in the Loire Valley in the {{province}} of Poitou (Poitou-Charentes, France) was built by the Aviau de Ternay family.

5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century</b> {{the fashion}} for {{portraiture}} had spread down {{the social order}} to lairds such as Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and John Napier of Merchiston. Adam de Colone, perhaps the son of Adrian Vanson and probably trained in the Netherlands, was working in England in the 1620s. In 1623 he painted his portrait of George Seaton, 3rd Earl of Winton and his sons and another of Seaton's wife Anne Hay with her two daughters.|$|E
5|$|Continuing eastwards, {{the river}} is crossed by Iping Bridge at Iping, a narrow stone bridge with five arches dating from <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century.</b> To {{the west of the}} bridge is the site of Iping watermill. A mill was {{recorded}} there in the Domesday survey, completed in 1086. By 1665, there were the remains of a fulling mill at the site, and a wheat-mill and malt-mill, both part of the same building. It became a paper mill in the eighteenth century, and continued to operate until it was destroyed by fire in 1930. At Stedham, part of the civil parish of Stedham with Iping, Stedham Lane crosses the river on a stone bridge with six segmental arches. Five of them date from <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century,</b> with one later addition. The river then makes a large loop to the north, where Stedham Mill was situated. The mill building has been demolished, but the mill house is a listed structure. After the loop, Woolbeding Bridge, on the northern Edge of Midhurst, dates from the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries. It has four segmental arches, was restored in 1919, and is a grade II* listed structure.|$|E
5|$|In 1743 the Cameronians {{established}} {{themselves as}} the Reformed Presbyterian Church, remaining largely separate from religious and political debate. Of independent churches from England that were established in <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century</b> only the Quakers managed to endure in to the eighteenth century. Baptist chapels were re-established {{in the middle of}} the century and, although Scotland initially appeared fertile ground for Methodism, it failed to expand as quickly as elsewhere in the Great Britain and Ireland. A number of minor Scottish sects developed, such as the Bereans, Buchanites, Daleites and Glassites.|$|E
