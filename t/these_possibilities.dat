These observations, combined with observations of Kepler-10's spectrum taken from the W.M. Keck Observatory, ruled {{out the possibility that}} a nearby star's light was corrupting the observed spectrum of Kepler-10 and creating the results that had led astronomers to believe that a second planet existed in Kepler-10's orbit. All of <b>these</b> <b>possibilities,</b> with the exception of if such a star existed exactly behind or in front of Kepler-10, were effectively ruled out; even with this, the Kepler team found that if a star was indeed aligned with Kepler-10 as seen from Earth, such a star would probably not be a giant star.|$|E
5|$|The move 4.Nf3 {{develops}} a piece and covers the sensitive d2-square. After 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2Nc6 6.a3 Black can easily get {{confused by the}} move-order. The natural 6...Nxd2 7.Bxd2 Bxd2+ 8.Qxd2 Qe7 9.Qc3 transposes {{in the same position}} as after 5.Bd2, but White can also try 6...Nxd2 7.axb4! Nxf3+ 8.gxf3 Nxe5 9.Rg1 Qe7 10.Ra3! with a strong initiative. White can even retain his bishop with 6...Nxd2 7.Nxd2 and now Borik recommends 7...Bf8 with difficult play for Black as he is not certain to gain his pawn back. To avoid <b>these</b> <b>possibilities</b> Lalic advises the move-order 6...Bxd2+ 7.Bxd2 Nxd2 8.Qxd2 Qe7, but does not mention the possibility of White answering 6...Bxd2+ with 7.Nxd2. A possible improvement for Black (after 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2) would be 5...d5 with compensation for the pawn in all lines.|$|E
5|$|There are an {{infinite}} number of other intermediate processes in which more and more photons are absorbed and/or emitted. For each of <b>these</b> <b>possibilities</b> there is a Feynman diagram describing it. This implies a complex computation for the resulting probability amplitudes, but provided it is the case that the more complicated the diagram the less it contributes to the result, {{it is only a matter}} of time and effort to find as accurate an answer as one wants to the original question. This is the basic approach of QED. To calculate the probability of any interactive process between electrons and photons it is a matter of first noting, with Feynman diagrams, all the possible ways in which the process can be constructed from the three basic elements. Each diagram involves some calculation involving definite rules to find the associated probability amplitude.|$|E

5|$|The {{competition}} from the Terrapins caused Dunn to sustain large losses. Although by late June the Orioles were in first place, having won over two-thirds of their games, the paid attendance dropped as low as 150. Dunn explored a possible move by the Orioles to Richmond, Virginia, {{as well as the}} sale of a minority interest in the club. <b>These</b> <b>possibilities</b> fell through, leaving Dunn with little choice other than to sell his best players to major league teams to raise money. He offered Ruth to the reigning World Series champions, Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics, but Mack had his own financial problems. The Cincinnati Reds and New York Giants expressed interest in Ruth, but Dunn sold his contract, along with those of pitchers Ernie Shore and Ben Egan, to the Boston Red Sox of the American League (AL) on July 4. The sale price was announced as $25,000 but other reports lower the amount to half that, or possibly $8,500 plus the cancellation of a $3,000 loan. Ruth remained with the Orioles for several days while the Red Sox completed a road trip, and reported to the team in Boston on July 11.|$|E

25|$|Why the Ancestral Puebloans {{left their}} {{established}} {{homes in the}} 12th and 13th centuries is not clear. Factors examined and discussed include global or regional climate change, prolonged periods of drought, cyclical periods of topsoil erosion, environmental degradation, deforestation, hostility from new arrivals, religious or cultural change, and influence from Mesoamerican cultures. Many of <b>these</b> <b>possibilities</b> are supported by archaeological evidence.|$|E
25|$|With {{the cave}} {{thoroughly}} searched, some divers began questioning whether Ben {{was there at}} all. Perhaps his body had been secretly removed from the cave before searching began and disposed of on land or it had washed out through the spring's outlet.

Authorities began to consider <b>these</b> <b>possibilities</b> and adjust their search.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19th century {{spectral}} analysis was developed by Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen. It enabled the acquisition of information on the physical parameters and chemical abundances of stars, by the spectral analysis of their light. Foerster recognized <b>these</b> <b>possibilities</b> and initiated the building of a solar observatory in 1871 as a memorial to the crown prince, in which he emphasized the importance and profit of solar research.

25|$|After 2000, {{research}} {{around the}} codex {{has become more}} intense. Benedek Láng summarized the previous attempts and the possible research directions in an article and in a book sized monograph. He argued that the codex is not a hoax (as opposed to mainstream Hungarian academic opinion), instead it is a consciously encoded or enciphered text. It may be (1) a cipher, (2) a shorthand system, or (3) an artificial language. Láng assessed <b>these</b> <b>possibilities</b> systematically in his publications {{with the help of}} historical analogies.|$|E
25|$|To give an example, two chess players {{might be}} engaged in a bitter {{struggle}} at the board, but they share all sorts of Background presuppositions: that they will take turns to move, {{that no one else}} will intervene, that they are both playing to the same rules, that the fire alarm won't go off, that the board won't suddenly disintegrate, that their opponent won't magically turn into a grapefruit, and so on indefinitely. As most of <b>these</b> <b>possibilities</b> won't have occurred to either player, Searle thinks the Background must be unconscious, though elements of it can be called to consciousness (if the fire alarm does go off, say).|$|E
25|$|According to Fisher (1970), {{there are}} four phases of decision-making: orientation, conflict, emergence, and reinforcement. As a {{communicative}} approach, the orientation stage is where the members involved are becoming acquainted both with themselves {{as well as the}} problem at hand. The conflict stage is where the problem is analyzed with several possibilities presented to resolve the problem. Upon discussing <b>these</b> <b>possibilities,</b> the emergence phase becomes known when a decision is made about which solution is to be used. The reinforcement stage is the supportive of the decision. These phases are not without objection from many theorists in the field. Morley and Stephenson (1977) claim that such a staged model of decision-making is not so rigid between phases and varies depending upon the types of decisions made.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{the early}} years of the war, British foreign {{secretary}} Lord John Russell, Emperor Napoleon III of France, and, to a lesser extent, British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston, showed interest in recognition of the Confederacy or at least mediation of the war. William Ewart Gladstone, the British finance minister whose family wealth was based on slavery, was the key advocate calling for intervention to help the Confederacy achieve independence. He failed to convince prime minister Palmerston. By September 1862 the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam, Lincoln's preliminary Emancipation Proclamation and abolitionist opposition in Britain put an end to <b>these</b> <b>possibilities.</b> The cost to Britain of a war with the U.S. would have been high: the immediate loss of American grain shipments, the end of exports to the U.S., and the seizure of billions of pounds invested in American securities. War would have meant higher taxes, another invasion of Canada, and full-scale worldwide attacks on the British merchant fleet. Outright recognition would have meant certain war with the United States; in mid-1862 fears of race war as had transpired in Haiti led to the British considering intervention for humanitarian reasons. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation did not lead to interracial violence let alone a bloodbath, but it did give the friends of the Union strong talking points in the arguments that raged across Britain.|$|E
500|$|... "Empty Orchestra" [...] {{follows a}} {{relatively}} simple narrative of co-workers on a night out, telling several interweaved stories through body language, muffled conversations and relevant song lyrics. Phil Harrison, writing for The Guardian, characterised the episode as [...] "a study in communication breakdown; how people use booze, loud music and enforced jollity to fill the gaps between them". Possibilities for macabre developments are seeded in the early episode, but, contrary to viewer expectations, <b>these</b> <b>possibilities</b> are cut off; for example, Duane's [...] "pills" [...] are merely Tic Tacs, and Roger's list—as revealed in his [...] "David Brentish" [...] speech—has no sinister purpose.

500|$|His {{work with}} {{electronic}} music and its utter fixity {{led him to}} explore modes of instrumental and vocal music in which performers' individual capabilities and the circumstances of a particular performance (e.g., hall acoustics) may determine certain aspects of a composition. He called this [...] "variable form" [...] In other cases, a work may be presented {{from a number of}} different perspectives. In Zyklus (1959), for example, he began using graphic notation for instrumental music. The score is written so that the performance can start on any page, and it may be read upside down, or from right to left, as the performer chooses [...] Still other works permit different routes through the constituent parts. Stockhausen called both of <b>these</b> <b>possibilities</b> [...] "polyvalent form" [...] , which may be either open form (essentially incomplete, pointing beyond its frame), as with Klavierstück XI (1956), or [...] "closed form" [...] (complete and self-contained) as with Momente (1962–64/69) [...]|$|E

When asked why he had never married, Cardozo replied, quietly and sadly, [...] "I never could give Nellie the second place in my life." [...] Polenberg suggests that friends may have stressed Cardozo's devotion to his sister to discourage rumors [...] "that he was sexually dysfunctional, or had an unusually low sexual drive or was homosexual." [...] But he produces {{no evidence to support}} any of <b>these</b> <b>possibilities,</b> except to note that friends, in describing Cardozo, used words like [...] "beautiful", [...] "exquisite", [...] "sensitive" [...] or [...] "delicate." [...] Andrew Kaufman, author of Cardozo, a biography published in 2000, notes that [...] "Although one cannot be absolutely certain, it seems highly likely that Cardozo lived a celibate life". Judge Learned Hand is quoted in the book as saying about Cardozo: [...] "He [...] no trace of homosexuality anyway".|$|E
500|$|Mass Effect 2 was {{developed}} by BioWare and directed by Casey Hudson, who previously led {{the production of the}} first Mass Effect game. Before actual production began, BioWare created a list of goals to work towards based on feedback from fans, reviewers and internal people. The company's main goal was to [...] "create an experience that was less about being a game and more about being an experience." [...] In contrast to the exclusive focus on the main story of the original Mass Effect, Hudson explained that BioWare was interested in a plot where optional stories had as much intensity as the main story and decided that the idea of recruiting people and making them loyal to the player so that they could survive a suicide mission allowed to explore <b>these</b> <b>possibilities.</b> He noted, [...] "the funny thing is that people will say 'other than gathering your crew and building your team and getting ready for this mission, there's not much story there.'

500|$|For example, the {{original}} window system, called 8½, exploited <b>these</b> <b>possibilities</b> as follows. Plan 9 represents the user interface on a terminal {{by means of}} three pseudo-files: , which can be read by a program to get notification of mouse movements and button clicks, , {{which can be used}} to perform textual input/output, and , writing to which enacts graphics operations (see bit blit). The window system multiplexes these devices: when creating a new window to run some program in, it first sets up a new namespace in which , [...] and [...] are connected to itself, hiding the actual device files to which it itself has access. The window system thus receives all input and output commands from the program and handles these appropriately, by sending output to the actual screen device and giving the currently focused program the keyboard and mouse input. The program does not need to know if it is communicating directly with the operating system's device drivers, or with the window system; it only has to assume that its namespace is set up so that these special files provide the kind of input and accept the kind of messages that it expects.|$|E
