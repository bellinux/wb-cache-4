In the proposed method, it is as-sumed that, for a certain technical domain, a list of known <b>technical</b> <b>terms</b> of the domain is given. Technical documents of the domain are collected through the Web search engine, which are then used for generating a vec-tor space model for the domain. The domain specificity of a target term is estimated according to {{the distribution of the}} domain of the sample pages of the target term. We apply this technique of estimating domain speci-ficity of a term to the task of discovering novel <b>technical</b> <b>terms</b> that are not included in any of existing lexicons of <b>technical</b> <b>terms</b> of the domain. Out of randomly selected 1, 000 candidates of <b>technical</b> <b>terms</b> per a domain, we discovered about 100 ∼ 200 novel <b>technical</b> <b>terms.</b> ...|$|R

The objective {{of this study is}} to describe the translation strategies in translating those <b>technical</b> <b>terms.</b> This research used qualitative analysis. The data of this research were taken from “beginning tennis” video, and it is analyzed by using five steps: analyzing every utterance and its translation in the form of subtitles, finding the <b>technical</b> <b>terms</b> after analyzing the utterances and its translation, classifying the <b>technical</b> <b>terms</b> in form of table to make it easier to be described, describing the strategies used by the translator in translating the <b>technical</b> <b>terms</b> from the source language into the target language, and drawing conclusion. This thesis only focuses on the strategies used by the translator in translating the <b>technical</b> <b>terms.</b> Furthermore, it can be seen in the data that the translator used translation using a loan word at (88, 29 %), translation by omission at (9, 46 %), and translation by illustration at (2, 25 %). The dominant strategy used by the translator is translation by using loan word, because it is easier for the translator to borrow or rewrite the word rather than finding the equivalence in the target language. This strategy is tolerable since the message is well delivered in the target language. Keywords: <b>Technical</b> <b>Terms,</b> Translation, Translation Strategie...|$|R

25|$|For Roman Catholics, fasting, {{taken as}} a <b>technical</b> <b>term,</b> is the {{reduction}} of one's intake of food to one full meal (which may not contain meat on Ash Wednesday and Fridays throughout Lent) and two small meals (known liturgically as collations, taken {{in the morning and}} the evening), both of which together should not equal the large meal. Eating solid food between meals is not permitted. Fasting is required of the faithful between the ages of 18 and 59 on specified days. Complete abstinence of meat for the day is required of those 14 and older. Partial abstinence prescribes that meat be taken only once {{during the course of the}} day. Meat is understood not to include fish or cold-blooded animals.|$|E

The school, not then named, was always intended to be a college-level institution; later in the same advertisement, Smith explicitly likens its curriculum to that of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). “Academy” was a <b>technical</b> <b>term</b> used for college-level schools not run by the established church.|$|E

25|$|Extinction is the <b>technical</b> <b>term</b> to {{describe}} the procedure of withholding/discontinuing reinforcement of a previously reinforced behavior, resulting in the decrease of that behavior. The behavior is then set to be extinguished (Cooper et al.). Extinction procedures are often preferred over punishment procedures, as many punishment procedures are deemed unethical and in many states prohibited. Nonetheless, extinction procedures must be implemented with utmost care by professionals, as they are generally associated with extinction bursts. An extinction burst is the temporary increase in the frequency, intensity, and/or duration of the behavior targeted for extinction. Other characteristics of an extinction burst include an extinction-produced aggression—the occurrence of an emotional response to an extinction procedure often manifested as aggression; and b) extinction-induced response variability—the occurrence of novel behaviors that did not typically occur prior to the extinction procedure. These novel behaviors are a core component of shaping procedures.|$|E

500|$|The {{history of}} the term conatus {{is that of a}} series of subtle tweaks in meaning and {{clarifications}} of scope developed over the course of two and a half millennia. Successive philosophers to adopt the term put their own personal twist on the concept, each developing the term differently such that it now has no accepted definition. The earliest authors to discuss conatus wrote primarily in Latin, basing their usage on ancient Greek concepts. These thinkers therefore used [...] "conatus" [...] not only as a <b>technical</b> <b>term</b> but as a common word and in a general sense. In archaic texts, the more technical usage is difficult to discern from the more common one, and they are also hard to differentiate in translation. In English translations, the term is italicized when used in the technical sense or translated and followed by conatus in brackets. Today, conatus is rarely used in the technical sense, since modern physics uses concepts such as inertia and conservation of momentum that have superseded it. It has, however, been a notable influence on nineteenth- and twentieth-century thinkers such as Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Louis Dumont.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} genetic drift was first {{introduced}} {{by one of the}} founders in the field of population genetics, Sewall Wright. His first use of the term [...] "drift" [...] was in 1929, though {{at the time he was}} using it in the sense of a directed process of change, or natural selection. Random drift by means of sampling error came to be known as the [...] "Sewall–Wright effect," [...] though he was never entirely comfortable to see his name given to it. Wright referred to all changes in allele frequency as either [...] "steady drift" [...] (e.g., selection) or [...] "random drift" [...] (e.g., sampling error). [...] "Drift" [...] came to be adopted as a <b>technical</b> <b>term</b> in the stochastic sense exclusively. Today it is usually defined still more narrowly, in terms of sampling error, although this narrow definition is not universal. Wright wrote that the [...] "restriction of [...] "random drift" [...] or even [...] "drift" [...] to only one component, the effects of accidents of sampling, tends to lead to confusion." [...] Sewall Wright considered the process of random genetic drift by means of sampling error equivalent to that by means of inbreeding, but later work has shown them to be distinct.|$|E
500|$|The {{emergence}} of developed hill forts has {{been attributed to}} Iron Age society becoming more complex. The {{emergence of}} one dominant hill fort in an area indicates that the inhabitants of a particular hill fort became more important than their contemporaries, possibly through warfare. However, a general dearth of evidence for destruction and an increase of artefacts associated with crafts and industry suggest that the reason for change was economic. Hill forts may have become important as centres of trade. This is supported by the possibility that the multiple rings of ditches often employed at developed hill forts (the <b>technical</b> <b>term</b> for which is [...] "multivallate") were likely to be not just defensive; so many ditches and ramparts, such as those at Maiden Castle, were excessive for defence alone so were likely used as statements of power and authority. Developed hill forts were generally densely occupied; this is best demonstrated at Danebury, where 57% of the site has been excavated. While developed hill forts were of a higher status than their smaller predecessors, they were not all equal and Cunliffe states that the Maiden Castle's monumental defences probably indicate that it was of higher status than other developed hill forts.|$|E
500|$|The sparse funk song [...] "Chicken Grease" [...] has lyrics advising against acting [...] "uptight", and it {{features}} D'Angelo referencing the line [...] "I know you got soul" [...] from Eric B. & Rakim's {{song of the}} same name (1987). It contains an ambiguous harmony and bass by Pino Palladino, who evokes the playing style of James Jamerson, with spontaneously improvised variations-on-a-theme parts that sit back [...] "in the pocket". The track was originally intended for Common's Like Water for Chocolate, but D'Angelo offered Common the song [...] "Geto Heaven Part Two" [...] as a trade. [...] "Chicken Grease" [...] is named after a <b>technical</b> <b>term</b> that musician Prince used for his guitarist to play a 9th minor chord while playing 16th notes. The song contains background voices, which one writer described as [...] "omnipresent party people channeled in from 'What's Going On' and 'Voodoo Chile', laughin and carryin on all over". Co-written by D'Angelo's former girlfriend, singer Angie Stone, [...] "Send It On" [...] contains lyrics concerning themes of honesty and faith in love, and features jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove on flugel horn. Titled after a southern colloquial conflation of the terms [...] "One More Time" [...] and [...] "Again", the mid-tempo ballad [...] "One Mo'Gin" [...] has its narrator reminiscing about a former lover. Its introductory sound consisting of soft organ work and dim percussion evokes the sound of D'Angelo's [...] "Sh★t, Damn, Motherf★cker" [...] (1995). [...] "One Mo'Gin" [...] contains strong jazz overtones and a prominent rocksteady drum rhythm played by Questlove. It incorporates Delta blues-style bass and keyboard-driven verses with a melodic hook. The song is introduced with lead-in bass licks by Pino Palladino, who adds musical texture to its sparse composition by using 10th notes and other arpeggio shapes. According to Seattle Weeklys Tricia Romano, the song's music actualizes [...] "new skool sensibility with old school soul".|$|E
