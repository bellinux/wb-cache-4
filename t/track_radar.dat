Rebuilt, {{this was the first}} phased-array radar system especially designed to detect and track objects in space. The physical structure of the system was 13 stories high, and the radar contained 5,134 transmitters and 4,660 receivers and utilized three computers. [...] The Air Force took ownership of the site in September 1968 with the 20th Surveillance Squadron as the primary operator. Initially charged with tracking objects in Earth's orbit, new software installed in 1975 allowed tracking of submarine-launched ballistic missiles. This became the unit's primary mission, while continuing to perform space tracking. The AN/FPS-85 played an active role in America's space program. From 1971 to 1984, the 20th SURS was the site of the Alternate Space Surveillance Center. It provided computational support to the Space Surveillance Center at Cheyenne Mountain AS, Colo. If the need arose, the squadron could assume command and control for worldwide space track sensors. Space operations began in February 1969. Initially designed to track satellites, new software installed in 1975 enabled the unit to track submarine-launched ballistic missiles, or SLBMs. This became the unit's primary mission, while space surveillance became secondary. From 1971 to 1984 the 20 SURS served as the Alternate Space Surveillance Center, providing computational support to the Space Surveillance Center at Cheyenne Mountain AS, Colorado. If the need arose, the squadron could assume command and control of worldwide SSN. In 1979, the 20 SURS was renamed the 20th Missile Warning Squadron, or 20th MWS, and four years later, with inactivation of Strategic Air Command, the squadron was transferred to Air Force Space Command. During this time, the AN/FPS-85 was the proving ground for development of phased array radars designed specifically for early warning of SLBM attacks. These PAVE Phased Array Warning System radars assumed missile warning responsibilities from the 20th MWS and in 1987, the unit returned to its original mission of space surveillance with a corresponding name change to the 20th Space Surveillance Squadron. In February 2003, the unit was again re-designated, this time as the 20th SPCS. In October 2004, a detachment was activated under the 20th SPCS at Dahlgren, Virginia, and the unit assumed control of the U.S. Navy's AN/FPS-133 Space Surveillance Radar Fence and the Alternate Space Control Center.|$|E

5000|$|The {{successful}} {{development of}} T/R module would normally signal the progress {{to the next}} stage of the development, and the 14th Institute mistakenly believed that PLAN would grant the developmental funds for further development. However, this was not meant to be because politics came into play. [...] To fight for the huge developmental fund and the associated fund for infrastructure development, the other competitor of SAPARS, the 23rd Institute collected potential shortfalls of S-band radar and thru political maneuver, successfully obtained the support from then Chinese premier Li Peng, who was once the head aerospace ministry, the predecessor of CASIC and parent company of the 23rd Institute. Under the political pressure, another round of evaluation by 10 academicians of Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) were held in May 1994, and academicians included radars specialist Chen Yun-Fang (陈芳允), Mao Er-Ke (毛二可), Bao Zheng (保铮), Wang Xiao-Mo (王小谟), and Wang Yue (王越). Also included was destroyer designer Pan Jing-Fu (潘镜芙) and missile specialist Xu Chang-Lin (徐长林). The S-band APAR design with a maximum range of three hundred seventy-five kilometer range of the 14th Institute was clearly technically superior than the C-band APAR design of the 23rd Institute, which only has a maximum range of a hundred twenty kilometers, just approximately a third of range requirement while the S-band APAR design exceeded the original three hundred kilometer range requirement by 25%. However, the academicians’ votes were not unanimous. Academician Bao Zheng, Wang Xiao-Mo, Xu Chang-Lin, Pan Jing-Fu favored the S-band design, but Academician Mao Er-Ke and Chen Yun-Fang favored the C-band design, because Aerospace Ministry ordered its employee Chen Yun-Fang to vote for the C-band design and promised a reward after his vote. Aerospace Ministry also helped Mao Er-Ke in obtaining his academician title and he voted for C-band design in return. Academician Wang Yue was the general designer of a competing design offered by 206th Institute competing against 14th Institutes earlier for Type 373 counter-battery radar, which the 14th Institute won with the design by the deputy general engineer of the 14th Institute Wang Dechun (王德纯) at the time so Wang Yue voted abstention. [...] Due to the voting outcome by academicians were not unanimous, the general designer of 052B/C destroyers Mr. Yuan Dun-Lei could not make the final decision, and PLAN once again delayed its decision to require further studies of both design. In addition to the outcome of first evaluation by CAS academicians, there was another hurdle: 23rd Institute, the developer of HHQ-9, changed the parameters and requirements of HHQ-9, so system integration of APAR and the SAM system would thus encountered additional obstacles. Two of the major changes are the weakening of HHQ-9 tracking signal and the tracking range of HHQ-9 respectively. For the signal tracking, the signal is greatly reduced ostensively to reduce the probability of being intercepted by enemy. For the tracking range increase, it was ostensively due to the range of HHQ-9 has being increased by several dozen kilometers, so tracking range must be increased accordingly. Though these two changes appeared to be legitimate, the changes were made after the parameters of HHQ-9 were already set when the bid first started, and the change of the original requirement were viewed by both the 14th Institute and PLAN evaluation team as a willfully generated obstacle to prevent 14th Institute from winning due to the political interference from the very top level of the Chinese government. Unreasonable as it was, 14th Institute was forced to once again revise its design to meet the new requirement that was more stringent. If not, its competitor 23rd Institute would have a chance to field its design. The proposal of the 23rd Institute appeared to be a compromise, with the S-band APAR of the 14th Institute as search and <b>track</b> <b>radar,</b> and its own C-band APAR for missile control. This twin radar concept of the 23rd Institute would increase the weight of the superstructure tremendously, a problem 23rd Institute recommended to be left for the general designer of the destroyer to solve. Obviously this could not be achieved in the short frame of time, and {{in order to meet the}} original schedule of delivery PLAN desperately needed, decision was made to import Russian MR-710 Fregat (meaning frigatebird) radar (NATO reporting name: Top Plate) for installation onboard Type 052B destroyers first, and APAR would have to wait until later for Type 052C destroyers.|$|E

This case study on Typhoon Nuri examines the dynamic and thermodynamic structure changes of this tropical cyclone, including the intensity, <b>track,</b> <b>radar</b> reflectivity, and azimuthally-averaged plots of tangential winds, radial winds, vertical velocity, and cloud water. The life cycle of Typhoon Nuri was broken down into the formation, intensification, and decay stages and one model run from each stage was evaluated. The minimum sea-level pressure and maximum winds were found {{for each of the three}} grids of the COAMPS-TC model and the high-resolution (T 799) ECMWF model and compared to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center best-track values. The forecast tracks from both models were examined and compared to the best-track values. Overall, the models did the best during the intensification stage. Lastly, the aircraft data were compared to the initial conditions for the model, and it is concluded that this aspect is the major source of forecast error...|$|E
40|$|A radar-based {{analysis}} of the structure, motion, and rainfall variability of westward-propagating squall-line mesoscale convective systems (SLMCSs) in Niamey, Niger, during the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Activities (AMMA) 2006 special observing period is combined with an {{analysis of}} 700 -mb (hPa) winds and relative vorticity to study the relationship between SLMCSs and African easterly waves (AEWs). Radar results show that SLMCSs {{were the most important}} rainmakers in Niamey and accounted for about 90 % of the rainfall despite being present less than 17 % of the time. Analysis of the 700 -mb synoptic-scale flow revealed that during the 2006 West African monsoon season the African easterly jet vacillated between about 10 ° and 15 °N on time scales of 1 – 2 weeks. AEWs followed the jet as it vacillated north and south, thereby producing two preferred paths for AEWs propagating past Niamey’s longitude, a northern track along 8 °– 16 °N and a southern track along 2 °– 6 °N. It was found that Niamey SLMCSs occurred westward of the trough of AEWs propagating along either track. The properties of SLMCSs must then be placed {{in the context of their}} location relative to these two AEW tracks, rather than in the trough and ridge pattern of a single AEW <b>track.</b> <b>Radar</b> analysis further indicated that although the total amounts of rainfall produced by SLMCSs occurring in both African easterly jet latitude regimes were similar, significant structural differences occurred between the two groups of systems. SLMCSs that formed to the west of AEW troughs propagating along the northern track had a significantly larger mean stratiform rain fraction in an environment of lower convective available potential energy when compared with the SLMCSs that occurred to the west of the troughs of AEWs in the southern track. The authors conclude that AEWs that propagated farther north provided a more favorable environment for stratiform rain production in Niamey SLMCSs than those AEWs located farther south. These results may be helpful to studies of the two-way interaction between AEWs and convection in West Africa...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, great steps {{have been taken}} to {{decrease}} passenger fatality in cars. Systems such as ABS and airbags have been developed for this purpose alone. But not much effort has been put into pedestrian safety. In traffic today, pedestrians {{are one of the most}} endangered participants and in recent years, there has been an increased demand for pedestrian safety from the European Enhanced Vehicle safety Committee and the European New Car Assessment Programme has thereby developed tests where pedestrian safety is rated. With this, detection of pedestrians has arised as a part in the automotive safety research. This thesis provides some of this research available in the area and a brief introduction to some of the sensors readily available. The objective of this work is to detect pedestrians in front of a vehicle by using thermoelectric infrared sensors fused with short range radar sensors and also to minimize any missed detections or false alarms. There has already been extensive work performed with the thermoelectric infrared sensors for this sole purpose and this thesis is based on that work. Information is provided about the sensors used and an explanation of how they are set up during this work. Methods used for classifying objects are given and the assumptions made about pedestrians in this system. A basic tracking algorithm is used to <b>track</b> <b>radar</b> detected objects in order to provide the fusion system with better data. The approach chosen for the sensor fusion is a central-level fusion where the probabilities for a pedestrian from the radars and the thermoelectric infrared sensors are combined using Dempster-Shafer Theory and accumulated over time in the Occupancy Grid framework. Theories that are extensively used in this thesis are explained in detail and discussed accordingly in different chapters. Finally the experiments undertaken and the results attained from the presented system are shown. A comparison is made with the previous detection system, which only uses thermoelectric infrared sensors and of which this work continues on. Conclusions regarding what this system is capable of are drawn with its inherent strengths and weaknesses...|$|E
