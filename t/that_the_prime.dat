40|$|In this expository article, we {{describe}} the recent approach, motivated by ergodic theory, towards detecting arithmetic patterns in <b>the</b> <b>primes,</b> and in particular establishing in [26] <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>primes</b> contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. One of the driving philosophies is to identify precisely what the obstructions could be <b>that</b> prevent <b>the</b> <b>primes</b> (or any other set) from behaving “randomly”, and then either show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> obstructions do not actually occur, or else convert the obstructions into usable structural information on <b>the</b> <b>primes...</b>|$|R

5|$|At present, it is {{not clear}} what {{evidence}} the President may rely on to be satisfied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister has ceased to command the confidence of a majority of MPs, as the Singapore courts have not yet had to decide the issue. In the Sarawak case of Stephen Kalong Ningkan v. Tun Abang Haji Openg, decided on provisions similar to those in the Singapore Constitution, the court found that the phrase ceased to command the confidence of a majority of the Members of Parliament was a term of art which had to be signified by a formal vote of no confidence taken by the legislature. In contrast, a Sabah court held in Datuk Amir Kahar v. Tun Mohd Said bin Keruak, Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sabah that loss of confidence could be assessed on the basis of evidence other than a legislative vote. This might include, for instance, media reports or letters addressed to the President.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{frequent}} mentioning of the Diolkos {{in connection with}} military operations, modern scholarship assumes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prime</b> purpose of the trackway {{must have been the}} transport of cargo, considering that warships cannot have needed transporting very often, and ancient historiography was always more interested in war than commerce. Comments by Pliny the Elder and Strabo, which described the Diolkos as being in regular service during times of peace, also imply a commercial use of the trackway. Coinciding with the rise of monumental architecture in Greece, the construction of the Diolkos may have initially served particularly for transporting heavy goods like marble, monoliths and timber to points west and east. It is not known what tolls Corinth could extract from the Diolkos on its territory, {{but the fact that the}} trackway was used and maintained long after its construction indicates that it remained for merchant ships an attractive alternative to the trip around Cape Malea for much of antiquity.|$|E

In the latter situation, the President is required first to inform the Prime Minister of his evaluation in this regard, and if the Prime Minister requests him to, the President may dissolve Parliament instead of making a declaration of vacancy. A general election must be held within three months after the dissolution of Parliament. This gives the former Prime Minister the opportunity to consolidate support by receiving a fresh mandate at the polls.|$|E
5|$|The Regent let his ministers {{take full}} charge of {{government}} affairs, playing a far lesser role than his father. The principle <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prime</b> minister {{was the person}} supported by {{a majority in the}} House of Commons, whether the king personally favoured him or not, became established. His governments, with little help from the Regent, presided over British policy. One of the most important political conflicts facing the country concerned Catholic emancipation, the movement to relieve Roman Catholics of various political disabilities. The Tories, led by the Prime Minister, Spencer Perceval, were opposed to Catholic emancipation, while the Whigs supported it. At the beginning of the Regency, the Prince of Wales was expected to support the Whig leader, William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville. He did not, however, immediately put Lord Grenville and the Whigs into office. Influenced by his mother, he claimed that a sudden dismissal of the Tory government would exact too great a toll on the health of the King (a steadfast supporter of the Tories), thereby eliminating any chance of a recovery.|$|E
5|$|Rainilaiarivony's first royal wife, Queen Rasoherina, died on 1 April 1868, and was {{succeeded by}} her cousin RanavalonaII (crowned on 3 September 1868) who, like Rasoherina, was a widow of RadamaII. RanavalonaII was a pupil of Protestant missionaries and had {{converted}} to Christianity. Rainilaiarivony recognized the growing power of Christianity {{on the island}} and identified the need to bring it under his influence in order to avert destabilizing cultural and political power struggles. The Prime Minister encouraged the new queen to Christianize the court through a public baptism ceremony at Andohalo on 21 February 1869, the day of their marriage. In this ceremony the supernatural royal talismans were ordered to be destroyed and replaced by the Bible. The Christianization of the court and the establishment of the independent royal Protestant chapel on the palace grounds prompted the wide-scale conversion {{of hundreds of thousands of}} Malagasy. These conversions were commonly motivated by a desire to express political allegiance to the Crown, and as such were largely nominal, with the majority of converts practicing a syncretic blend of Christian and traditional religions. Rainilaiarivony's biographers conclude <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister's own conversion was also largely a political gesture and most likely did not denote a genuine spiritual shift until late in his life, if ever. Some local officials attempted to force conversions to Protestantism by mandating church attendance and persecuting Catholics, but Rainilaiarivony quickly responded to quell these overzealous practices. The Prime Minister's criminalization of polygamy and alcohol consumption, as well as the declaration of Sunday as a day of rest, were likewise inspired by the growing British and Protestant influences in the country. The Christianization of the court came at a steep personal price: with the outlawing of polygamy, Rainilaiarivony was forced to repudiate his first wife. The Prime Minister was deeply saddened by this necessity and by the consequent souring of his relationships with Rasoanalina and their children after the divorce.|$|E
