5|$|North Carolina's first {{possession}} of the second overtime period ended with a turnover, while Kansas missed a long jump shot in theirs. North Carolina's Brennan boxed out Chamberlain who went over Brennan to collect the rebound and was called for over the back. Joe Quigg turned the ball over after traveling, while Chamberlain threw {{the ball out of}} bounds on the subsequent possession. Carolina failed to capitalize on Chamberlain's error when Kearns missed the front end of a one–and–one. Kansas came down the court and passed the ball to Chamberlain who was then fouled hard by Cunningham. This sparked an altercation between the two teams, which resulted in Chamberlain being hit in the stomach with a megaphone and his knee being scarred by a Carolina cheerleader. The referees stopped the commotion and Chamberlain was sent to the line, where he missed his shots, and Carolina got the rebound. The Tar Heels aimed to hold the ball for a final shot but <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> ball over to Kansas with ten seconds to go and the Jayhawks called a timeout with six seconds left. The ball went to Kansas' Loneski who missed a shot and the game remained tied at 48.|$|E
5|$|The Horns took {{possession}} of the ball to start the game and used {{less than two minutes}} in scoring on a 25-yard carry by Jamaal Charles. Rice advanced to the Texas43-yard line before punting the ball to Texas' one-yard line, forcing the Longhorns to start from inside their own end zone. UT drove the ball 99yards in sevenplays for a secondtouchdown. With fourseconds left in the first quarter, Vince Young threw a pass that was intercepted by Ja'Corey Shepherd at the UT20-yard line. Rice lost yardage on their possession and failed to convert on fourth down so <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> ball over on downs. The rest of the first-half scoring was dominated by the Longhorns as they scored four more touchdowns to take a 42–0 lead. The Owls had four–more possessions in the second–quarter but never advanced the ball past their own 30-yard line.|$|E

5|$|On Penn State's {{first play}} from {{scrimmage}} {{in the second}} half, Zach Zwinak fumbled, and it was returned for a touchdown by Frank Clark to pull within four points. After another Penn State drive stalled, Michigan drove down the field, and {{was faced with a}} third-and-short before a freshman offensive lineman committed a dead ball unsportsmanlike conduct penalty to back up Michigan to face a third and long; on that play Olaniyan recorded his third sack of the day, and Michigan punted. On Penn State's ensuing drive, <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> ball over again, this time via a Hackenberg interception; Michigan capitalized by kicking a field goal. When Penn State got the ball back, they ran a sustained, balanced drive (4 run plays, 5 pass plays, 50 yards) down the field during which they went to Bill Belton in the running game (as Zwinak had fumbled previously in the half) that culminated with Sam Ficken kicking a 45-yard field goal to go up by 4 points. Michigan promptly drove right back down the field, and Gardner threw a touchdown pass to Jeremy Gallon to take the lead for the second time, 27–24. In the fourth quarter, Ficken attempted a 47-yard field goal, but missed, and Penn State's 10-play 45-yard drive came up empty. Michigan took advantage of their ensuing field position and ran a quick drive that ended with a 37-yard touchdown pass from Gardner to Funchess, putting them on top by 10 with 10:28 to go. On Penn State's ensuing drive, they converted a fourth down and one near midfield prior to a penalty and then a sack setting up a third and long on which Hackenberg threw an incomplete pass, so they were forced to settle with pulling within 7; Sam Ficken kicked a 43-yard field goal. Michigan tried to run out the clock on their next drive, and Penn State burned all three of their timeouts. Though they were at one point within field goal range, they committed a five-yard delay of game penalty that pushed them out of range, and they had to punt. Penn State got the ball with 50 seconds left and no timeouts at their own 20-yard line. Needing a touchdown to tie the game, Penn State's first play of scrimmage was a pass from Hackenberg to Robinson along the sideline that was ruled incomplete on the field, but was reviewed and overturned and counted as a 14-yard gain. The next play was an acrobatic catch by Felder for 29 yards, and then a pass down the sideline to Robinson for 36 yards to put the ball inside the one yard line with 29 seconds remaining. Michigan then called their final timeout. Hackenberg then attempted a quarterback sneak over the right side for a touchdown; the play was reviewed and the call was confirmed, and Ficken made the extra point to tie the game with 27 seconds left. Michigan took the ball at their own 35, drove it to the other 35, and lined Gibbons up to attempt a 52-yard field goal, which he missed short. Penn State got the ball with two seconds left, but downed the ball to send the game into overtime.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter, the Eagles had {{one last chance}} to come back, driving 74 yards in 11 plays to the Panthers 11-yard line. But linebacker Dan Morgan picked off a pass from backup quarterback Koy Detmer {{in the end zone}} with 5:16 left. The next time Philadelphia got the ball back, <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> ball over on downs and Carolina ran out the clock to win the game.|$|E

25|$|In {{the next}} game, a 21–14 {{victory over the}} Kentucky Wildcats, the Wildcats scored against the Commodores {{for the first time}} in their history. Kentucky's second {{possession}} began with Bob Lavin fumbling the return, which was recovered by Neely on the 10-yard line. On third down, after little gain on first and second, Frank Godchaux ran an end-around touchdown. Rupe Smith scored the other two touchdowns, his first on a drive begun with a 22-yard pass from Neely to captain Pink Wade (father of later Vanderbilt quarterback Bill Wade). One Kentucky touchdown followed a blocked Neely punt. The Wildcats threatened to score late and tie the game, but <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> ball over on downs at the two-yard line; Neely ran 34 yards, to the 36-yard line.|$|E
25|$|Fourteen Choctaw Indian {{men in the}} Army's 36th Division {{trained to}} use their {{language}} for military communications.

Within 24 hours after the US Army starting using the Choctaw speakers, <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> tide of battle by controlling their communications. In less than 72 hours, the Germans were retreating and the Allies were on full attack. The 14 Choctaw Code Talkers were Albert Billy, Mitchell Bobb, Victor Brown, Ben Caterby, James Edwards, Tobias Frazer, Ben Hampton, Solomon Louis, Pete Maytubby, Jeff Nelson, Joseph Oklahombi, Robert Taylor, Calvin Wilson, and Captain Walter Veach.|$|E
25|$|Elway's injury worsened to {{the point}} of his being {{replaced}} by backup Gary Kubiak in the fourth quarter. Kubiak managed to lead the Broncos into Bills territory, but <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> ball over on downs when defensive back Cliff Hicks tackled Mike Young on the Buffalo 23-yard line one yard short of a first down on fourth and 11. After being completely dominated up to this point, Buffalo's offense got on track with a pivotal 25-yard third down completion by Kelly to tight end Keith McKeller. A few runs by hobbled Buffalo running back Thurman Thomas and a 10-yard catch by Reed carried the Bills to within field goal range, and with 4:18 left in the game, Buffalo kicker Scott Norwood made a 44-yard field goal to increase the lead to 10–0.|$|E

25|$|Utilizing the wildcat formation, Shaq Washington {{rushed for}} a {{touchdown}} within the first minute of the final quarter of play, pulling the Bearcats within 19. On the ensuing kickoff, CINCY recovered a fumble from T. J. Logan, fueling momentum for the Bearcats, who started at the 6-yard line. They started in the wildcat, but when faced with third and goal at the eight-yard line, Kay returned at quarterback and completed a pass, but it was short of the end zone; the Bearcats went for it on fourth down, and Kay threw a pass that bounced off {{the hands of his}} intended target, and thus, <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> ball over. Looking to milk the clock on their ensuing drive, UNC achieved a first down prior to losing six yards on a rush to set up third down and long; a pass interference bailed them out on the third and long play, as though the pass was incomplete, the 15-yard penalty gave them an automatic first down. They succeeded in their endeavor to drain time from the clock, ultimately executing a 14-play drive that gained 74 yards and lasted 9:19, and culminated with a 40-yard field goal to complete the scoring.|$|E
25|$|Leading 28–10 in the 3rd quarter, the 49ers added 14 more points. The Chargers {{were forced}} to punt after three plays on the opening drive of the second half, and Dexter Carter {{returned}} the ball 11 yards to his own 38-yard line. Young subsequently completed three consecutive passes for 53 yards on a 7-play, 62-yard drive that ended with Watters' third touchdown on a 9-yard run. After a 33-yard kickoff return by Andre Coleman, the Chargers advanced to the San Francisco 33-yard line, but <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> ball over on downs when Humphries' fourth-down pass was broken up by Davis. After the turnover, Young led his team on a 10-play, 67-yard drive, aided by a 22-yard pass interference penalty against Darrien Gordon on third and 14, to score on his fifth touchdown pass, a 15-yard completion to Rice. The Chargers' only highlight of the 3rd quarter was when Coleman returned the ensuing kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown. Then, wide receiver Mark Seay caught a pass for a successful two-point conversion (the first in Super Bowl history), but it only cut the deficit to 42–18.|$|E
25|$|The Badgers {{took the}} opening drive {{of the second}} half and moved into the Gamecocks red zone but would be forced to settle for a 35–yard field goal by K Jack Russell. South Carolina got the ball for their first second half drive. On their first play, Connor Shaw {{scrambled}} for 8 yards but fumbled after he was hit by Badgers LB Derek Landisch. The ball was recovered by fellow Badgers LB Ethan Armstrong. Wisconsin started at the South Carolina 31–yard line but failed to move the ball into the red zone and were forced to try a field goal. The kick from Jack Russell was wide right from 42 yards. South Carolina then drove 75 yards scoring on a 22–yard touchdown pass to Bruce Ellington from Connor Shaw. On the first play of the Badgers next drive, QB Joel Stave would scamble for 5 yards but was hit hard by a South Carolina defender. A few plays later after handing the ball off, Stave would be forced to leave the game with a shoulder injury. Taking over at quarterback for the Badgers was sixth year senior Curt Phillips. The third quarter would come to a close with the Badgers moving into Gamecock territory. On fourth and one from the South Carolina 26–yard line, Wisconsin decided to go for the first down instead to try a 40 plus yard field goal. The Gamecocks defense stuffed the Badgers and <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> ball over on down. Six plays later, South Carolina extended their lead with a 3–yard touchdown pass to Jerell Adams from Connor Shaw. However, the Badgers would strike quickly on the ensuring kickoff. Badgers kick returner, Kenzel Doe, returned the kickoff 91 yards for a touchdown. The return was highlighted with a stiff arm that sprung Doe for the score. The Badgers were within three with just under 11 minutes left in the game. Once again, South Carolina would answer this time a 9 play 88 yard drive capped by a 1–yard touchdown run by Connor Shaw on a QB sneak. The Badgers then took over and got to the Gamecocks 47–yard line before Curt Phillips was intercepted. With less than five minutes left, the Gamecocks took over. Wisconsin LB Conor O'Neill then forced a fumble that was recovered by CB Darius Hillary. The Badgers then moved the ball to the Gamecocks 16–yard line but again backup QB Curt Phillips was intercepted. The Badgers defense would force the Gamecocks to punt and the Badgers took over with 2:10 left in the game still down by 10 points. Wisconsin got down to South Carolina's 17–yard line but the Badgers tried a trick play with a screen to WR Jared Abbrederis who then attempted to pitch the ball to RB Melvin Gordon but he mishandled the ball and fumbled turning the ball over to South Carolina. Two kneel downs later and the game was over with a South Carolina victory over Wisconsin, 34–24.|$|E

500|$|Between November 1963 and February 1964, Sellers began filming A Shot in the Dark, an {{adaptation}} of a French play, L'Idiote by Marcel Achard. Sellers found the part and the director, Anatole Litvak, uninspiring; the producers brought in Blake Edwards to replace Litvak. Together with writer William Peter Blatty, <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> script into a Clouseau comedy, also adding Herbert Lom as Commissioner Dreyfus and Burt Kwouk as Cato. During filming, Sellers's relationship with Edwards became strained; the two would often stop speaking to each other during filming, communicating only by the passing of notes. Sellers's personality was described by others as difficult and demanding, and he often clashed with fellow actors and directors. Upon its release in late June 1964, Bosley Crowther noted the [...] "joyously free and facile way" [...] in which Sellers had developed his comedy technique.|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{felt that}} the album's {{production}} was inferior to that of Dr. Octagonecologyst. KutMasta Kurt, a frequent collaborator with Thornton, disliked the album's production, stating [...] "The Dr. Octagon character was rapping over sounds that were dark and sinister, but <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> album into this dancey electro-pop. A lot of it had this Euro-dance feel, and I was like, 'Wait a second, {{not only did they}} change the music, they changed it into something [...] I couldn't relate.'" [...] KutMasta Kurt also recounts a conversation with Thornton on a European flight in December 2006, in which Thornton stated that The Return of Dr. Octagon does not sound like a Dr. Octagon album. Thornton himself said that he liked the album's production, but that the album hurt his reputation as a musician. According to Thornton, [...] "I'm not mad. But I don't repeat words when I rap. They cooked up some electronic stuff, you know, WORD! WORD! WORD! making me sound like triple people. It's interesting." ...|$|E

The final scene was shot to be reminiscent of the similar scene in the original 1978 Superman film, where Reeve rips open his shirt to reveal the Superman suit. Beeman {{and the rest of}} the production staff reviewed the scene to make sure that they filmed the homage correctly, but Beeman later noted that the iconic scene was [...] "clunkier" [...] and more [...] "out of focus" [...] than they wanted, and that people's memories make it seem more impressive. However, he was pleased that the recreated shot was the sequence to wrap up Smallville, noting that he [...] "always thought that was going to be the final moment".|$|E

500|$|Green's {{improvements}} {{came just}} in time to meet the challenge of the Great Siege of Gibraltar between 1779–83. Despite the siege, the defences were continually improved under Green's supervision. More batteries and bastions were constructed on the North Front, {{all the way up to}} the summit of the Rock. The first of Gibraltar's many tunnels was also constructed, with the original intention of reaching a rocky outcrop called the Notch on the north face of the Rock, to cover a blind angle on the Mediterranean side. As the tunnel was being constructed, an air vent was excavated using explosives. The tunnellers realised that they could use the shaft as an embrasure for a gun. <b>They</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> tunnel into the first of a series of galleries with embrasures at intervals, overlooking the isthmus, which could be used to bombard the enemy lines with impunity. The tunnelling continued after the siege and by 1790 over [...] of tunnels had been excavated, providing bombproof communications routes between the various lines and batteries on the North Front of the Rock. The Notch was also reached and was hollowed out to become a large gallery, called St George's Hall, capable of accommodating five guns.|$|E

Later that month, indie musician Logan Lynn released a cover version of the track, which Lindsey Weber of New York Magazine called [...] "dreamy [...] guitar-heavy" [...] and an editor from The Huffington Post called [...] "bold" [...] and [...] "warmer" [...] than the original. British singer Neon Hitch released a cover of [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] with lyrical adjustments, which Jenna Hally Rubenstein from MTV Buzzworthy called a [...] "kinda-reggae-kinda-jazz-kinda ska-definitely-awesome cover". The track was also performed by Avery, The Vamps, and Tay Zonday. In 2014, The Electrical Fire released a cover version of the song, as well as an alternate version which combined it with Kanye West's [...] "Runaway", pointing out the similarity between the two songs.

500|$|Returning to the Credit Mission, Jones {{believed}} {{the most pressing}} issue for the Mississaugas was their lack of a clear title to their land. [...] The settlement had established successful farms, and was almost self-sufficient. [...] It was also developing industry, {{with a pair of}} carpenters and a shoemaker. [...] The Credit Mission Mississaugas had also funded the construction of a pair of piers {{at the mouth of the}} Credit River, the beginning of Port Credit. [...] Although the settlement was prospering, Indian Superintendent Thomas G. Anderson pressured to band to move off the Credit Mission to a different location, hoping to group Indians into larger settlements where schools could be reasonably established and funded. [...] As an inducement to motivate the Mississaugas to move, he promised them the title deeds which were Jones' main goal for the band. [...] The Saugeen Ojibwa invited the Credit Mississaugas to move to the Bruce Peninsula, which was the last large piece of unceded land in southern Ontario. [...] The Credit Mississaugas believed this to be their best chance to obtain deeds to land, and so the band prepared for a move. [...] <b>They</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> Credit lands over to the province in trust, but the first survey of the Bruce returned with terrible news: The soil of the Bruce Peninsula was completely unsuitable for farming. [...] Having already surrendered their land at the Credit Mission, the Mississaugas faced an uncertain situation. [...] The Six Nations, hearing of the Mississaugas' desperate situation offered a portion of their tract to the Credit Mississaugas, remembering that when the Six Nations had fled to Upper Canada the Mississaugas had donated the land the Six Nations. [...] The Mississaugas relocated to this land along the Grand River that was donated by the Six Nations. [...] Founded in 1847, the settlement was named New Credit. Jones would continue in his role as a community leader here, petitioning various branches of government for funding to build the settlement. [...] In 1848, the Wesleyans and Methodists reconciled, and William Ryerson established a mission in New Credit.|$|E
