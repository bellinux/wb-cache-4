Long-time Wildcats radio broadcaster Cawood Ledford wrote the book's foreword. By the end of October, the book had sold 30,000 copies, and a second printing from the publisher was ordered. Farmer participated in several book signings across the state, as well as filming television advertisements for local products and conducting speaking engagements for dental insurance provider Delta Dental to promote good oral health in his native eastern Kentucky.|$|E

25|$|William Shakespeare {{wrote his}} play Hamlet {{sometime}} between 1599 and 1602. The Ur-Hamlet {{is thought to}} be his primary source; his version owes but the outline of the story to Saxo. In character, Shakespeare's Prince Hamlet is diametrically opposed to his prototype. Amleth's madness was certainly altogether feigned; he prepared his vengeance a year beforehand, and carried it out deliberately and ruthlessly at every point. His riddling speech has little more than an outward similarity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Hamlet, who resembles him, however, in his disconcerting penetration into his enemies' plans.|$|E

25|$|A {{third and}} {{distinctive}} image is of Jesus representing an ascetic figure; a prophet of the heart. Although the Qur'an {{refers to the}} ‘gospel’ of Jesus, those specific teachings of his are not mentioned. The Sufi movement is where Jesus became revered, acknowledged as a spiritual teacher with a distinctive voice from other prophets, including Muhammad. Sufism is a tendency, within Islam, to explore the dimensions of union with God through many approaches including asceticism, poetry, philosophy, speculative suggestion and mystical methods. Although Sufism to the western mind may seem to share similar origins or elements of Neoplatonism, Gnosticism and Buddhism, the ideology is distinctly Islamic since they adhere <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> the Qur'an and pursue imitation of Muhammad as the perfect man.|$|E
25|$|The {{text of the}} Torah {{says that}} the name of Simeon refers to Leah's belief that God had heard that Jacob {{preferred}} her sister, Rachel, implying a derivation from the Hebrew term shama on, meaning he has heard of my suffering; this is a similar etymology as the Torah gives for the theophoric name Ishmael (God has heard), implying that the names are cognate. The name is sometimes interpreted as meaning he who listens <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> God, {{and at other times}} thought to derive from sham 'in, meaning there is sin, which is argued to be a prophetic reference to Zimri's sexual miscegenation with a Midianite woman, a type of relationship which rabbinical sources regard as sinful.|$|E

When she was the only Tony Award nominee for the production, she declined the nomination saying that she could not accept because she felt the entire production was snubbed.|$|E

25|$|Members of the BAPS branch {{support the}} {{ontology}} of Akshar through various accounts from Swaminarayan’s time by pointing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Swaminarayan in the Vachanamrut, {{specifically in the}} chapters of Gadhada I-21, Gadhada I-71, Gadhada III-26, Vadtal 5 and others. In Vachanamrut Gadhada I-21, Swaminarayan states that “Akshar has two forms”; one is impersonal, known as “Brahmamahol” or Akshardham, and “in its other form, that Akshar remains {{in the service of}} Purushottam Nãrãyan.” The personal form of Akshar is understood to serve Purushottam within his divine abode and also when God incarnates on earth. Swaminarayan clarifies this in Vachanamrut Gadhada I-71 stating that “when God incarnates on earth… he is always accompanied by his Akshardham. ” Pointing to these and many other statements by Swaminarayan in the Vachanamrut, the BAPS denomination of Swaminarayan Hinduism supports the Akshar doctrine within the Akshar Purushottam Upasana. To explain their understanding that this Akshar first incarnated on earth as Gunatitanand Swami, they point to evidence from other scriptures and authoritative sources in which Swaminarayan and others revealed Gunatitanand Swami as Akshar.|$|E

500|$|An {{important}} subset to this deterministic theme, {{related to}} the original worldview idea as well, {{is the lack of}} personal responsibility that those in the underclass accept for their own actions.

Corgan has said, [...] "We generally resisted the idea of what I call the classic MTV rock video, which is like lots of people jumping around and stuff." [...] The band worked with video directors including Kevin Kerslake ("Cherub Rock"), Samuel Bayer ("Bullet with Butterfly Wings"), and, most frequently, the team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris ("Rocket", [...] "1979", [...] "Tonight, Tonight", [...] "The End Is the Beginning Is the End", and [...] "Perfect"). Corgan, who was frequently heavily involved in the conception of the videos, said of Dayton and Faris, [...] "I know my [...] versions are always darker, and they're always talking me into something a little kinder and gentler." [...] Videos like [...] "Today", [...] "Rocket", and [...] "1979" [...] dealt with images taken from middle American culture, albeit exaggerated.
