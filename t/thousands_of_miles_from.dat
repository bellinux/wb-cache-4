25|$|Because of its {{tendency}} to travel very long distances at sea, individual saltwater crocodiles {{have been known}} to appear occasionally in areas far away from their general range. Vagrant individuals have historically been reported on New Caledonia, Fiji, and in Asian waters possibly swam with Kuroshio Current, reaching such as at Iwo Jima, Hachijō-jima, Amami Ōshima, Iriomote-jima (residences by several individuals along Urauchi River from Bakumatsu to Meiji until being hunted by locals were suggested), pelagic waters off Shima, Mie, Miura Peninsula, and even in the relatively frigid Sea of Japan (<b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> their native territory.) In late 2008-early 2009, a handful of wild saltwater crocodiles were verified to be living within the river systems of Fraser Island, hundreds of kilometres from, and in much cooler water than, their normal Queensland range. These crocodiles did indeed migrate south to the island from northern Queensland during the warmer wet season and presumably returned to the north upon the seasonal temperature drop. Despite the surprise and shock within the Fraser Island public, this is apparently not new behaviour, and in the distant past, wild crocodiles had been reported appearing occasionally as far south as Brisbane during the warmer wet season.|$|E
500|$|After {{she left}} de Bruin late in 1971, Dworkin said, her ex-husband attacked, persecuted, and harassed her, beating her and {{threatening}} her whenever he found {{where she was}} hiding. She found herself desperate for money, often homeless, <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> her family, later remarking that [...] "I often lived {{the life of a}} fugitive, except that it was the more desperate life of a battered woman who had run away for the last time, whatever the outcome". Dworkin worked as a prostitute for a period. Ricki Abrams, a feminist and fellow expatriate, sheltered Dworkin in her home, and helped her find places to stay on houseboats, a communal farm, and deserted buildings. Dworkin tried to work up the money to return to the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Etoile and Sultane, {{although}} the ostensible victors in the engagement, were both badly damaged themselves, with all masts suffering severely from the British bombardment and combined casualties of between 20–40 killed and 30–60 wounded. The {{damage to the}} masts was serious, as the frigates were <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> a friendly port and unable to effect any but the most basic repairs. Sultane in particular needed substantial temporary repairs {{and was forced to}} erect jury masts as the damage was too severe for regular service. Unable to continue their cruise, the frigates turned north towards Europe. By 26 March the squadron was sailing eastwards in the English Channel, approximately [...] north of the Île de Batz in Brittany en route to the Normandy port of Saint Malo. At 09:00 two vessels were sighted close by, their approach masked by heavy fog. These were the British 36-gun frigate HMS Hebrus under Captain Edmund Palmer and the 16-gun brig-sloop HMS Sparrow under Commander , participating in the blockade of the French Channel ports.|$|E

Of all persons in the world to meet on top of the Rocky Mountains <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> home, he was the last one I should have looked for. We were school-boys together and warm friends for years. But a boyish prank of mine had disruptured this friendship and it had never been renewed. The act of which I speak was this. I had been accustomed to visit occasionally an editor whose room was in the third story of a building and overlooked the street. One day this editor gave me a watermelon which I made preparations to devour on the spot, but chancing to look out of the window, I saw John standing directly under it and an irresistible desire came upon me to drop the melon on his head, which I immediately did. I was the loser, for it spoiled the melon, and John never forgave me and we dropped all intercourse and parted, but now met again under these circumstances.|$|E
60|$|Her only {{struggle}} was in coaxing Kennicott not {{to spend all}} his time with the tourists from the ten thousand other Gopher Prairies. In winter, California is full of people from Iowa and Nebraska, Ohio and Oklahoma, who, having traveled <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> their familiar villages, hasten to secure an illusion of not having left them. They hunt for people from their own states to stand {{between them and the}} shame of naked mountains; they talk steadily, in Pullmans, on hotel porches, at cafeterias and motion-picture shows, about the motors and crops and county politics back home. Kennicott discussed land-prices with them, he went into the merits of the several sorts of motor cars with them, he was intimate with train porters, and he insisted on seeing the Luke Dawsons at their flimsy bungalow in Pasadena, where Luke sat and yearned to go back and make some more money. But Kennicott gave promise of learning to play. He shouted in the pool at the Coronado, and he spoke of (though he did nothing more radical than speak of) buying evening-clothes. Carol was touched by his efforts to enjoy picture galleries, and the dogged way in which he accumulated dates and dimensions when they followed monkish guides through missions.|$|E
60|$|To {{many of my}} readers, to all {{who have}} {{interested}} themselves {{in the history of}} religion and its effect on individual minds--its psychology--all I have written concerning my mental condition at that period, will come as a twice-told tale, since thousands and millions of men have undergone similar experiences and have related them in numberless books. And here I must beg my reader to bear in mind that in the days of my youth we had not yet fallen into the indifference and scepticism which now infects the entire Christian world. In those days people still believed; and here in England, in the very centre and mind of the world, many <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> my rude wilderness, the champions of the Church were in deadly conflict with the Evolutionists. I knew nothing about all that: I had no modern books--those we had were mostly about a hundred years old. My fight up to this period was all on the old lines, and on this account I have related it as briefly as possible; but it had to be told, since it comes into the story of the development of my mind at that period. I have no doubt that my sufferings through these religious experiences were far greater than in the majority of cases, and this for the special reason which I have already intimated.|$|E
