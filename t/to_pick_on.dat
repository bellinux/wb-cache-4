2500|$|In September 2013, {{during an}} {{interview}} with The Guardian, Hersh commented that the 2011 raid {{that resulted in the}} death of Osama bin Laden was [...] "one big lie, not one word of it is true". He said that the Obama administration lies systematically, and that American media outlets are reluctant to challenge the administration, saying [...] "It's pathetic, they are more than obsequious, they are afraid <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>on</b> this guy [...] ". Hersh later clarified that he didn't dispute Bin Laden's death in Pakistan, and rather meant that the lying began in the aftermath of bin Laden's death.|$|E

It never was" [...] (53).|$|E

2500|$|During her testimony, Kristiansens mother {{described}} his childhood as {{one with a}} lot of tantrums and rage. In elementary school he would frequently get into fights, as well as having verbal outbursts with his teachers. She also stated that they had a [...] "hard-time" [...] teaching him to read and to write. She said that he struggled with sports, before eventually quitting due to problems adjusting as well as being bullied. The mother said his hot temper made him a target for the older kids <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>on,</b> and during the eight grade he had enough. He would leave home for school in the morning like usual, but it turned out later that he had not been in school for half a year. He dropped out of school altogether in the ninth grade, and was since then involved with child psychiatric services.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 2007 Ouellette left TNA Impact! and Grenier {{was brought in to}} replace him as Blondin's co-host. While Ouellette was wrestling oversees, Blondin and Grenier {{continually}} insulted the former color commentator and referred to him as a [...] "jobber" [...] on air. Grenier eventually began <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>on</b> Blondin as well triggering a 3-way kayfabe feud. This culminated in a wrestling match between Ouellette and Grenier when the former returned from England. When Ouellette and Grenier faced each other in Hawkesbury, Ontario on June 21, 2008, Blondin served as the special guest referee. He and Grenier had posted numerous interviews on YouTube prior to the event. On May 12, 2007, he and PCO with Jean-françois Kelly started Top of the World Wrestling (TOW) in Montreal. The promotion brought in many former World Wrestling Entertainment wrestlers to the region during its first year in operation as well as showcasing many younger Quebec wrestlers and still run to today in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Manhunt 2 {{was listed}} at #82 in Complex's [...] "The 100 Best Video Games Of The Complex Decade". It was {{nominated}} for GameSpy's 2007 [...] "Game of the Year" [...] Award for the PS2, and Rockstar London {{was nominated for}} the [...] "Best New UK/European Studio" [...] Award. Giant Bomb listed it at #13 in their [...] "Best Storyline In Gaming" [...] list, and at #5 in their [...] "Shocking Moments in Video Games" [...] list. When GameSpot asked Jeronimo Barrera if the trouble that Rockstar had experienced in attempting to bring Manhunt 2 to release in North America had put the publisher off the franchise, Barrera shot down any doubt by confirming that if the fans wanted it, {{they were willing to}} continue the brand. Rockstar Games admitted that they were proud of the series and the fact people still want <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>on</b> the games is [...] "a strange and unfortunate reality." [...] Mark Washbrook gave an interview with the Official UK PlayStation Magazine in April 2007, in which he said that much of the reasoning behind the development of Manhunt 2 was its fan base.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} women's semi-final match, fifth seeded Russian Maria Sharapova {{defeated}} third seeded Serbian Jelena Janković in a two sets, 6–3, 6–1 to clinch the first {{spot in the}} finals. Janković later conceded that she [...] "wanted to withdraw", but played on for the crowd's benefit. Fourth seeded Ana Ivanovic also progressed to the final after defeating Daniela Hantuchová in three sets, 0–6, 6–3, 6–4. Ivanovic had lost the first eight games of the match before rectifying her game. However, Hantuchová was critical of Ivanovic's tactics during the latter stages of the match. Hantuchová claimed that Ivanovic resorted to gamesmanship by shuffling her feet prior to her serve, thereby causing a distraction. Ivanovic said that any possible noise {{was a result of}} the new court surface; and tried to offer an explanation of Hantuchová's motives, saying, [...] "Maybe she was just trying <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>on</b> something, to get upset." [...] Unseeded Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga defeated second seeded Spaniard Rafael Nadal in the first men's semifinal, in straight sets, 6–2, 6–3, 6–2 in less than 2 hours. Journalists expressed shock, not only at the victory, but at the comprehensive manner in which the nascent Tsonga won it. Tsonga hit a total of 49 winners to Nadal's 13 and served imperiously: Nadal was unable to force a break point until the third set.|$|E
2500|$|When Qin Lang grew up, he {{travelled}} around China and did {{not take}} up any appointments in the civil service or in the military. After Cao Cao's death in 220 CE, he remained {{in the state of}} Cao Wei – founded by Cao Cao's son and successor, Cao Pi – during the Three Kingdoms period. In 227, after Cao Rui, Cao Pi's son, ascended the Wei throne upon the death of his father, Qin Lang was appointed General of Valiant Cavalry (驍騎將軍) and Official Who Concurrently Serves in the Palace (給事中), and he constantly accompanied Cao Rui on his tours. During his reign, Cao Rui liked <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>on</b> people's wrongdoings, and many people who committed minor offences were executed by him. Qin Lang never advised Cao Rui against his ways, nor did he recommend any talents to the Wei imperial court, but he was still nonetheless deeply favoured by the emperor, who often consulted him and called him by his childhood name [...] "Ah-su" [...] (阿穌). Cao Rui also showered gifts on Qin Lang and even had a large residence constructed in the capital Luoyang for the latter. Other officials were aware that Qin Lang was not much of a capable and talented person, but they knew that he was close to the emperor Cao Rui, so they often bribed him and attempted to curry favour with him. In return, Qin Lang used his status and close relationship with Cao Rui to help these officials get promotions and even titles of nobility.|$|E

The fact was, there was rum in every family; the parents took it daily, the children learned to love and long after it, by seeing the parents, and drinking little sweetened remains at the bottoms of tumblers. There were, every year, families broken up and destroyed, and fine fellows going to the very devil, with this thing; and so we made a movement to form a temperance society. I paid lecturers, and finally lectured myself. At last they said to me: 'It's all very well for you rich people, that have twice as fine houses and twice as many pleasures as we poor folks, <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>on</b> us for having a little something comfortable to drink in our houses.
