5|$|Past {{studies have}} {{reported}} other social organizations in ruffed lemurs including monogamous pair bonding. This {{may have been due}} to the use of short-term, seasonal field studies instead of yearlong studies that take into consideration the effects <b>that</b> <b>changing</b> seasons have on ruffed lemur communities. For instance, during the cold, rainy season, which corresponds with the breeding season, interactions between core groups within a community are significantly reduced. During this time small subgroups form consisting of a mature female, a mature male, and sometimes offspring. This can be misinterpreted as monogamous pair bonding.|$|E
5|$|Sinden {{had changed}} the lineup and the Canadian goals were all scored by players Sinden had {{inserted}} in place of players who had played in Winnipeg. Still, Sinden felt <b>that</b> <b>changing</b> the lineup had been a mistake. According to Sinden, Ken Dryden, who had replaced Tony Esposito, {{did not have a}} good game; he was shaky and Tretiak was great. According to Conacher, the Soviets used cross-ice passing in the attacking zone, a tactic that caused problems for Dryden. Serge Savard missed the game after fracturing his ankle in practice.|$|E

5|$|In {{a survey}} {{released}} by the Pew Research Center in April 2007, viewers who watch both The Colbert Report and The Daily Show {{tend to be more}} knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources. Approximately 54% of The Colbert Report and The Daily Show viewers scored in the high knowledge range, followed by Jim Lehrer's program at 53% and Bill O'Reilly's program at 51%, significantly higher than the 34% of network morning show viewers. The survey shows <b>that</b> <b>changing</b> news formats have not made much difference on how much the public knows about national and international affairs, but adds that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know. The Project for Excellence in Journalism released a content analysis report suggesting that The Daily Show comes close to providing the complete daily news.|$|E
5|$|The film {{suffered}} setbacks {{in development}} in December 2002. Rudin left Unfortunate Events over budget concerns. While Sonnenfeld and Carrey remained, Sonnenfeld admitted he was skeptical of Paramount's $100million budget. The studio decided <b>that</b> <b>changing</b> the shoot from Hollywood to Wilmington, North Carolina {{would be less}} expensive. The April 2003 start date was also pushed back. Paramount eventually settled the situation in January 2003 by enlisting help from DreamWorks to co-finance the film, but Sonnenfeld vacated the director's position. Rudin and Sonnenfeld had no involvement with the film afterward, but were credited as executive producers. Carrey remained with approval over the hiring of the next director.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth and}} final season of The O.C., an American teen drama {{television}} series, aired in the United States from November 2, 2006 to February 22, 2007 and consisted of sixteen episodes. The O.Cs final season aired Thursdays at 9:00p.m. ET in the United States on Fox, a terrestrial television network. Fox tested a new timeslot by airing the second episode on Wednesday at 9:00p.m. ET against ABC's Lost and CBS's Criminal Minds. With Lost about to enter a three-month hiatus, Fox hoped <b>that</b> <b>changing</b> the timeslot for The O.C. would attract back viewers it had lost {{since the end of}} the previous season; however, the move was unsuccessful and the show returned to its Thursday timeslot.|$|E

5|$|Walter {{approaches}} Alistair as {{a fellow}} man of science, who is replacing components that form a time machine that he has constructed within his body. Walter professes that Alistair's attempt to jump back several months would require {{a great deal more}} power than Alistair has predicted, possibly killing hundreds in the area near where he appears. Alistair, aware of this, recalls an empty field where he was at, a few blocks from where his fiancée died, and plans to use this field where only the vegetation will die out from his arrival. Walter tells Alistair how to correct the mistake that caused him to jump to the train but warns him of the other consequences <b>that</b> <b>changing</b> events will bring, explaining that stealing Peter from the parallel universe has left him wracked with regret. Despite being a man of science, Walter's torment over the years drove him to believe in a higher power, and he hopes for a sign of God's forgiveness—and thus, eventually, Peter's—in the form of a white tulip.|$|E

25|$|All of {{the laws}} treated {{so far have been}} for {{conjunction}} and disjunction.

Equivalently, changing any variable from 0 to 1 never results in the output changing from 1 to 0. Operations with this property are said to be monotone.

25|$|As a result, {{actuarial science}} {{developed}} along a different path, becoming more reliant on assumptions, {{as opposed to}} the arbitrage-free risk-neutral valuation concepts used in modern finance. The divergence is not related to the use of historical data and statistical projections of liability cash flows, but is instead caused by the manner in which traditional actuarial methods apply market data with those numbers. For example, one traditional actuarial method suggests <b>that</b> <b>changing</b> the asset allocation mix of investments can change the value of liabilities and assets (by changing the discount rate assumption). This concept is inconsistent with financial economics.|$|E

With the recent mandate to increase biofuel content in the United States this area of research has become increasingly important, but to date has failed to guide public policy in the United States.|$|E
