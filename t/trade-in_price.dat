40|$|Despite {{documented}} {{benefits of}} remanufacturing, many manufacturers {{have yet to}} embrace the idea of tapping into remanufactured-goods markets. In this article, we explore this dichotomy and analyze the effect of remanufacturable product design on market segmentation and product and <b>trade-in</b> <b>prices</b> by studying a two-stage profit-maximization problem in which a price-setting manufacturer can choose {{whether or not to}} open a remanufactured-goods market for its product. Our results suggest that it is optimal for a manufacturer to design a remanufacturable product when the value-added from remanufacturing is relatively high but product durability is relatively low and innovation is nominal. In addition, we find that entering a remanufactured-goods market in and of itself does not necessarily translate into environmental friendliness. On the one hand, the optimal trade-in program could result in low return and/or remanufacturing rates. On the other hand, a low price for remanufactured products could attract higher demand and thereby potentially result in more damage to the environment. Meanwhile, external restrictions imposed on total greenhouse gas emissions draw criticism in their own right because they risk stifling growth or reducing overall consumer welfare. Given these trade-offs, we therefore develop and compare several measures of environmental efficiency and conclude that emissions per revenue can serve as the best proxy for emissions as a metric for measuring overall environmental stewardship...|$|R
40|$|Most durable {{products}} have two distinct types of customers: first-time buyers and customers who already own the product, but {{are willing to}} replace it with a new one or purchase a second one. Firms usually adopt a price-discrimination policy by offering a trade-in rebate only to the replacement customers to hasten their purchase decisions. Any return flow of products induced by trade-in rebates has the potential to generate revenues through remanufacturing operations. In this paper, we study the optimal pricing/trade-in strategies for such durable, remanufacturable products. We focus on the scenario where the replacement customers are only interested in trade-ins. In this setting, we study three pricing schemes: (i) uniform price for all customers, (ii) age-independent price differentiation between new and replacement customers (i. e., constant rebate for replacement customers), and (iii) age-dependent price differentiation between new and replacement customers (i. e., age-dependent rebates for replacement customers). We characterize the roles that the durability of the product, the extent of return revenues, the age profile of existing products in the market, and the relative size of the two customer segments play in shaping the optimal prices and the amount of trade-in rebates offered. Throughout the paper we highlight the operational decisions that might influence the above factors, and we support our findings with real-life practices. In an extensive numerical study, we compare the profit potential of different pricing schemes and quantify the reward (penalty) associated with taking into account (ignoring) customer segmentation, the price-discrimination option, return revenues, and the age profile of existing products. On the basis of these results, we are able to identify the most favorable pricing strategy for the firm when faced with a particular market condition and discuss implications on the life-cycle pricing of durable, remanufacturable products. <b>trade-in</b> rebates, <b>pricing,</b> remanufacturing, durable products, product-age profile...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{two classes}} of models of boundedly rational decision makers - one with application to finance {{and the other to}} pricing. It consists of three parts. The first part of the thesis investigates the impact of investors' boundedly rational forecasting on asset price bubbles. We present a class of models, called extrapolation-correction models, of boundedly rational investor behavior. That is, the investors in our model, quite reasonably, use data available to them, i. e. past price data, to form forecasts about future prices. We relate the model parameters to various behavioral aspects like investor memory, caution/confidence, and panic. We present the resulting dynamical system model of asset price bubbles and relate the behavior of the dynamical system to the parameters capturing investor forecasting behavior. We show that, depending on the behavioral parameters, the associated dynamical system can converge to the fundamental value, go into predictable price cycles, or go into unpredictable price cycles. In particular, we find that the greater the weight investors' forecasts put on the most recent observations, the greater the tendency for the asset prices to exhibit cycles, forming positive and negative bubbles. We also find that when forecasts are strongly affected by recent prices, the price process becomes chaotic and it becomes increasingly difficult to forecast future prices accurately. The second part of the thesis addresses the question: How do investors make their price forecasts? We present the design of an experiment where investors participate in a virtual asset market run over a computer network. During the course of the experiment, the participants report their price forecasts and enter buy and sell orders. The computer software determines the market clearing prices. Despite full disclosure of the assets' dividends and the fundamental value, the price trajectories in all three experimental sessions exhibited cycles. We calibrated various models, including rational expectations based models and the extrapolation-correction family of models presented {{in the first part of}} the thesis. The results indicate that rational expectations hypothesis does not provide an accurate model of forecast formation. Moreover, a simple one-parameter exponential smoothing model is much better at modeling forecast formation, with the extrapolation-correction models making the fit slightly better. The third part of the thesis explores a different aspect of customer rationality - that of customer impatience - and its effect on pricing of product versions. We consider a setting in which impatient customers are faced with frequent product introductions, for example, products like Apple iPhones. This raises the following questions regarding customers: Given the pricing strategy of the firm, what are the optimal buying behaviors of the customers? How does customer buying behavior change in relation to impatience? We consider two settings. In the first setting, the firm offers a <b>trade-in</b> <b>price</b> for existing customers and a higher full price for new customers. In the second setting, the firm offers the same prices to new and existing customers, however there is an introductory full price and a discounted price later in the product cycle. We model the customer's problem in these two settings and characterize their optimal actions as a function of the price parameters. We also analyze the bilevel program for the firm's pricing decisions. We see that in both settings considered there are certain well-defined regions in the price space wherein the firm's optimal decision lies. We also provide some numerical computations to study the behavior of the optimal prices as the cost per unit increases. Ph. D...|$|E
