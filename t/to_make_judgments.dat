25|$|Listeners' {{ratings in}} Barron-Lutzross's {{experiment}} of {{likelihood that a}} speaker is a lesbian correlated with several different phonological variables. Lower median pitch, a wider pitch range, a lower second formant, and more use of creaky voice correlated positively with listeners perceiving a voice as lesbian-sounding. Despite this, Barron-Lutzross {{did not find any}} direct correlations between these phonetic variables and sexual orientation. She stated that this could mean that listeners were using additional features which were not tested for <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>judgments</b> about the speakers' sexuality.|$|E

This in turn leads the person to believe the dream is real. Dreams may be absurd in nature but the senses are not able to discern whether they are real or not. So, the dreamer is left to accept the dream because they lack the choice to judge it.|$|E

25|$|The {{definition}} of Autonomy {{is the ability}} of an individual to make a rational, un-influenced decision. Therefore, {{it can be said that}} autonomy is a general indicator of health. The progression of many terminal diseases are characterized by loss of autonomy, in various manners. For example, dementia almost always results in the loss of autonomy. Dementia is a chronic and progressive disease that attacks the brain and affects the ability <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>judgments,</b> can induce memory loss, cause a decrease in rational thinking and affect orientation. This makes autonomy an indicator for both personal well-being, and for the well-being of the profession.|$|E
25|$|It is {{expected}} {{for children to}} develop gender-typed behavioural cues given that children often use gender-related information <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>judgments.</b> Society often rewards shared traditional behaviours, especially for men, and thus having progressed to a cross-gender development can lead to unwanted criticisms and punishment. Therefore, when children undergo atypical gender development, due to both genetic and environmental contributors, it can drastically alter normal development from a person’s sense of self-worth, self-esteem, to feelings of acceptance. When the child identifies as the opposite sex, {{he or she is}} then diagnosed with gender dysphoria (often termed gender identity disorder or GID).|$|E

On 31 March 2005, the Palace of Monaco announced that Hereditary Prince Albert would take over the duties of his father as regent since Rainier was no longer able to exercise his functions as sovereign.

25|$|There is also {{a drastic}} lack of {{education}} given to governments, farmers, and the community about the science behind GM crops, as well as suitable growing practices.

Governments are often not advised on the economic and health implications that come with growing GM crops, and are then left <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>judgments</b> on their own. Because they have so little information regarding these crops, they usually shy away from allowing them or do not take the time and effort required to regulate their use. Members of the community that will then consume the produce from these crops are also left in the dark about what these modifications mean and are often scared off by their 'unnatural' origins. This has resulted in failure to properly grow crops as well as strong opposition to the unknown practices.|$|E

2500|$|Behavioral {{measures}} also [...] "infer" [...] SA {{from the}} actions that individuals choose to take, {{based on the assumption}} that good actions will follow from good SA and vice versa. Behavioral measures rely primarily on observer ratings, and are, thus, somewhat subjective in nature. To address this limitation, observers can be asked to evaluate the degree to which individuals are carrying out actions and exhibiting behaviors that would be expected to promote the achievement of higher levels of SA (see, for example, the situation awareness behaviorally anchored rating scale (SABARS) – Matthews, Pleban, Endsley, & Strater, 2000; Strater et al., 2001). This approach removes some of the subjectivity associated with making judgments about an individual's internal state of knowledge by allowing them <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>judgments</b> about SA indicators that are more readily observable.|$|E
2500|$|Objective {{measures}} directly assess SA {{by comparing}} an individual's {{perceptions of the}} situation or environment to some [...] "ground truth" [...] reality. Specifically, objective measures collect data from the individual {{on his or her}} perceptions of the situation and compare them to what is actually happening to score the accuracy of their SA at a given moment in time. Thus, this type of assessment provides a direct measure of SA and does not require operators or observers <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>judgments</b> about situational knowledge on the basis of incomplete information. Objective measures can be gathered in one of three ways: real-time as the task is completed (e.g., [...] "real-time probes" [...] presented as open questions embedded as verbal communications during the task – Jones & Endsley, 2000), during an interruption in task performance (e.g., situation awareness global assessment technique (SAGAT) – Endsley, 1995a, or the WOMBAT situational awareness and stress tolerance test mostly used in aviation since the late 1980s and often called HUPEX in Europe), or post-test following completion of the task.|$|E

2500|$|Physical {{appearance}} {{gives us}} clear {{clues as to}} a person's personality without him/her ever having to speak or move. Women tend {{to be better than}} men at judging nonverbal behavior. [...] After viewing pictures of people in a neutral position and in a self-chosen posed position, observers were accurate at judging the target's levels of extraversion, emotional stability, openness, self-esteem, and religiosity. The combined impression of physical characteristics, body posture, facial expression, and clothing choices lets observers form accurate images of a target's personality, so long as the person observed is presenting themselves genuinely. However, there is some conflicting data in this field. Other evidence suggests that people sometimes rely too much on appearance cues over actual information. When provided with descriptive information about a target, participants still rely on physical appearance cues when making judgments about others' personalities and capabilities. Participants struggle to look past physical appearance cues even when they know information contrary to their initial judgment. Physical cues are also used <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>judgments</b> about political candidates based on extremely brief exposures to their pictures. Perceived competence level of a candidate measured from first impressions of facial features can directly predict voting results.|$|E

College presidents, academic deans and deans of admission do not know enough about other institutions to make meaningful comparisons. This gives a false sense of reliability to what is a ranking system without any real validity." [...] Sweet Briar College president, Elizabeth S. Muhlenfeld stated that, [...] "one of our colleagues likened it to trying to rank composers. It's a great analogy. How can you say that Beethoven and Brahms are better than Mahler or Mozart?" [...] Trinity Washington University president Patricia McGuire argued that, [...] "the survey asks me to 'rate the academic quality of undergraduate programs,' assigning each school a single score using a 1-to-5 scale from 'marginal' to 'distinguished.' That I have little real information about these 181 institutions does not seem to matter to the U.S. News editors [...] Some of the actual best colleges in this nation do not fare well in the U.S. News survey because {{they do not have the}} wealth, big-time sports notoriety or public relations clout to influence the peer voting system." [...] Finally, DePauw University president, Robert G. Bottoms, argued that, [...] "I, in fact, did not fill out the reputational survey for this past year. [...] I came to the conclusion that I am not in a position <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>judgments</b> on other schools, many of which I have little or no familiarity with.
