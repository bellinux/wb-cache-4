5|$|Inspired by {{personal}} crises and global events, We Don't Need <b>to</b> <b>Whisper</b> was conceptualized as DeLonge taught himself to play instruments and created {{his own home}} studio. He recruited his longtime friend and guitarist David Kennedy of Box Car Racer, as well as drummer Atom Willard and bassist Ryan Sinn to form Angels & Airwaves, who were primarily inspired by arena rock groups such as U2 and The Police. DeLonge's later public statements regarding the band's music prompted media interest and concern from his relatives and family.|$|E

5|$|We Don't Need <b>to</b> <b>Whisper</b> is {{the debut}} studio album by the American rock band Angels & Airwaves. Recorded at Neverpants Ranch in San Diego, California and {{produced}} by guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge, {{the album was}} released on May 23, 2006 through Geffen Records. In February 2005, DeLonge (who desired {{to spend more time}} with his family) departed from his former band Blink-182 after months of heated exchanges and increasing tension within the trio and spent the following three weeks in complete isolation, contemplating his life, career, and future in music.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift, barefoot and {{clad in a}} white sundress, {{approaching}} a tall, arched doorway which materializes {{in the middle of}} a barren landscape. Swift looks at a photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits down beside her and two begin <b>to</b> <b>whisper</b> and laugh to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake Taylor brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her and hugs her tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain and hugging her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 108 million views on YouTube.|$|E
25|$|The word waswās in waswāsi l-ḫannās {{means the}} one who whispers {{over and over again}}, and waswasa means <b>to</b> <b>whisper</b> into someone's heart an evil {{suggestion}} {{over and over again in}} such a way or ways that {{the one who}} is being inspired may not feel that the whisperer is whispering an evil suggestion into his heart. Waswasa by itself suggests repetition just as zalzala contains the meaning of repetitive movement. Since man is not tempted by just one attempt but effort has to be made over and over again to seduce and tempt him, such an attempt is called waswasa and the tempter waswās. As for the word ḫannās, it is derived from ḫunus, which means to hide after appearing and to retreat after coming into view. Since ḫannās is the intensive form, it would imply the one who behaves thus very frequently. Thus when once he fails in his attempt <b>to</b> <b>whisper</b> evil, he withdraws, then he again returns to make the second and the third and the next attempt over and over again.|$|E

25|$|Warren Oates as Willett Gashade. By {{the time}} Warren Oates starred in The Shooting, {{he had become}} a veteran western {{character}} actor, having appeared in dozens of film and television series in the genre since 1957. When director Hellman first suggested Oates as the star of the film, co-star and co-producer Nicholson immediately agreed with the choice. But during the filming, Nicholson and Oates repeatedly clashed, with the two frequently ending up in screaming matches. According to Hellman, production had to shut down for half a day when Oates refused to speak a lengthy amount of dialogue in the way Hellman wanted, preferring instead <b>to</b> <b>whisper</b> the lines almost unintelligibly. Oates stormed away from the film crew in anger when the director insisted. After Oates finally returned late in the afternoon, Hellman allowed the actor to read the lines the way he wanted, as long as he also read them in Hellman's preferred manner. In the editing room, Hellman rejected Oates's version.|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stone writer Christian Hoard {{summarized}} {{the record and}} the mixed reviews simply as [...] "DeLonge yanks heartstrings with so-so results" [...] and saw the atmospheric elements as excessive. Spin had a similar sentiment: [...] "Here, his three sidemen elevate [...] emo tendencies to something grander and more timelessly romantic—though somewhat less exciting. Blender scrunitized {{the composition of the}} album as it contains the [...] "duller" [...] aspects of Blink-182 accompanied with U2-influenced guitar chimes.Many critics arraigned the album to be pretentious and contrasted Angels & Airwaves with Blink-182. The A.V. Club journalist Kyle Ryan described his experience with We Don't Need <b>to</b> <b>Whisper</b> as 50 minutes of DeLonge demonstrating his musical skills. English magazine Uncut discerned his departure from Blink-182 and the album's serious tone. AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the differences in musical style between both bands, but remained polarized about the album and commented that [...] "It may not make for a successful record, but it does make for an interesting one, particularly in how DeLonge's desire to be taken seriously has led him to use the serious music of his adolescence as a signifier that he's serious now, but We Don't Need <b>to</b> <b>Whisper</b> is too doggedly dour and amorphous {{to be more than a}} curiosity."The album sold 127,000 copies its first week, and was certified Gold by the RIAA. It was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist in a Video, Best Special Effects in a Video and Best Editing in a Video for [...] "The Adventure," [...] as well as Best Band of 2006 for We Don't Need <b>to</b> <b>Whisper.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{overlying}} message {{the band}} intended for We Don't Need <b>to</b> <b>Whisper</b> {{is that the}} future could become a utopia. Opening track [...] "Valkyrie Missile" [...] opens We Don't Need <b>to</b> <b>Whisper</b> with a cinematic organ melody, 1980s-influenced guitars and a quote from an astronaut: [...] "Anybody out there?". [...] "Distraction" [...] follows and is filled with hand claps and a keyboard melody over verses lamenting death and destruction. [...] "Do It for Me Now" [...] originated from a beat DeLonge created in 2004 for rapper Talib Kweli, who turned the opportunity down; the Morse code beat was later adapted by the band and stimulated DeLonge's vision of the song being the soundtrack to [...] "young lovers watching the sunrise." [...] "The Adventure" [...] is an [...] "exhilarating ode to a beckoning future with a huge guitar sound reminiscent of The Cure." [...] The [...] song was motivated by a friend whose marriage was falling apart when his wife committed adultery. The situation had a deep impact on DeLonge in that he spent a night up crying {{for him when he}} wrote the track. [...] "A Little's Enough" [...] was inspired by a religious concept in which a God came to bring positive change on Earth when it faces terrorism, war or famine.|$|E

Agbaje had to play both Chloe's normal character and her character while being possessed by the Isolus, which Agbaje felt was [...] "weird". When performing as the Isolus she had <b>to</b> <b>whisper,</b> and an echo was added in post-production. Agbaje found it [...] "a bit hard to whisper" [...] because she had a husky voice. A hand double for Agbaje drew the pictures, while the series' storyboarder Shaun Williams drew the father in the cupboard.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy's wife Ethel {{stood outside}} the crush {{of people at the}} scene, seeking help. She was soon led to her husband and knelt beside him.

After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher, prompting him <b>to</b> <b>whisper,</b> [...] "Don't lift me..." [...] which were to become his last words. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter. Kennedy was taken a mile away to Central Receiving Hospital, where he arrived near death. One doctor slapped his face, calling, [...] "Bob, Bob", while another doctor manually massaged Kennedy's heart.

500|$|We Don't Need <b>to</b> <b>Whisper</b> was {{inspired}} by a mix of both personal developments and global events. During production, DeLonge studied World War II, which he considered the [...] "last great war clearly a battle between good and evil." [...] He saw America enter a post-war period of prosperity, and perceived it as an analogy for possibilities in his life. The album was encouraged by other personal crises as well, such as DeLonge's father's diagnosis of leukemia and his brother's deployment to Iraq; DeLonge criticized the Iraq War as unnecessary. Although the band deemed the project lightly progressive rock-influenced, the album lacks guitar solos the genre is commonly known for in place of melodies inspired by 1970s rock bands, such as Pink Floyd, Rush and Led Zeppelin. DeLonge was influenced by and listened to Peter Gabriel, U2, The Police and The Cure, all who were artists that achieved massive success and inspired DeLonge's desire to reach the widest audience possible.|$|E
500|$|We Don't Need <b>to</b> <b>Whisper</b> {{received}} largely {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics {{at the time}} of its release. Alternative Press was generally the most enthusiastic of the positive reviews, considering it influential to rock bands in 2006. The publication found the album to not be abounding or thought-provoking and commented: [...] "While the lyrics might be DeLonge at his most soul-searching, the music is built for nothing smaller than football stadiums." [...] IGN was also very positive in their assessment of the record, writing, [...] "This album is like a post-millennial concept record that beckons to be listened to with the lights dimmed and the headphones clamped tightly around your aural receptors. [...] It may not be your cup of tea, but kudos to the quartet for not merely re-treading the blink market with more mature lyrics." [...] Entertainment Weekly journalist Leah Greenblatt gave the album a B- rating, commending its obvious influences while also criticizing DeLonge's vocals. It stated that his vocals might improve to resemble those of Robert Smith heard on tracks like [...] "It Hurts", but likened it to a high school student with a job at Del Taco communicating with a drive-through microphone.|$|E

He worried that some viewers might miss the subtle message of the film and {{view it as a}} [...] "by-the-books love story that can feel cliche or even trite". Curtis Stone of Geekenstein gave it a 5 out of 5 and rated it #1 in his top five list of anime for 2013. He praised not only the art and music, but especially the voice acting, which he felt was perfect for the final scene. Lindsay Nelson at Midnight Eye compared the film <b>to</b> <b>Whisper</b> of the Heart by Studio Ghibli for its poetic use of [...] "seemingly bland and uninteresting locations". She was impressed with both the sound and art, and particularly the sweeping view of the Docomo tower with the sunset in the background. However, she criticized it for its [...] "tearfully over-the-top climax", [...] "treacly" [...] pop theme song, and lack of reflective silence.|$|E
