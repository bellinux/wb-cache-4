In 1584, a huge controversy over the method broke out in England when the Puritans attacked the art as impious because it was thought to excite absurd and obscene thoughts; this was a sensational, but ultimately not a fatal skirmish. Erasmus of Rotterdam and other humanists, Protestant and Catholic, had also chastised practitioners of the art of memory for making extravagant claims for its efficacy, although they themselves believed firmly in a well-disposed, orderly memory as an essential tool of productive thought.|$|E
500|$|Music writer Robert Christgau said Saadiq's {{compositions}} {{are characterized}} by [...] "groove rather than song". Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that the songs are [...] "tied together by the Mellotron, a vintage keyboard — commonly associated with psychedelic and progressive rock recordings, but not foreign to soul — that evokes diseased flutes and wheezing strings", adding that [...] "Saadiq tends to use the instrument for shading". Music journalist Jim DeRogatis observed [...] "a little less Motown gloss" [...] than The Way I See It and [...] "a little more rock grit in Saadiq’s grooves, heavy on the Sly Stone (witness the opening 'Heart Attack'), late '50s/early '60s Isley Brothers (the joyful 'Radio'), and Ray Charles ('Day Dreams'), <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skillful use of Mellotron orchestrations as a connecting thread throughout the disc, {{sort of like the}} Moody Blues suddenly finding the funk ('The Answer')." [...] Steve Horowitz from PopMatters found the songs' subject matter to be assorted and said that Saadiq [...] "personalizes each song so they seem connected as just the many aspects of one man’s existence and experience".|$|E

2500|$|However {{important}} all {{of these}} aesthetic movements were as antecedents, current ideas about literary criticism derive almost entirely from the new direction taken {{in the early twentieth}} century. Early in the century the school of criticism known as Russian Formalism, and slightly later the New Criticism in Britain and in the United States, came to dominate the study and discussion of literature, in the English-speaking world. Both schools emphasized the close reading of texts, elevating it far above generalizing discussion and speculation about either authorial intention (<b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> author's psychology or biography, which became almost taboo subjects) or reader response. This emphasis on form and precise attention to [...] "the words themselves" [...] has persisted, after the decline of these critical doctrines themselves.|$|E

2500|$|On the one hand, {{film and}} {{television}} producers seem to find Catholicism irresistible. There {{are a number of}} reasons for this. First, more than any other Christian denomination, the Catholic Church is supremely visual, and therefore attractive to producers and directors concerned with the visual image. Vestments, monstrances, statues, crucifixes – <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> symbols of the sacraments – are all things that more [...] "word oriented" [...] Christian denominations have foregone. The Catholic Church, therefore, lends itself perfectly to the visual media of {{film and television}}. You can be sure that any movie about the Second Coming or Satan or demonic possession or, for that matter, any sort of irruption of the transcendent into everyday life, will choose the Catholic Church as its venue. (See, for example, [...] "End of Days," [...] "Dogma" [...] or [...] "Stigmata.") ...|$|E

[...] In his journey back through time, Ned finds the cat packed away in a covered basket and alludes to the lifelessness of her as they travel down the Thames. [...] It is later {{discovered}} that in 1888 the butler, Baine, attempted to drown Princess Arjumand by throwing the box she was in into the Thames, only to be rescued by Verity, another time traveler, and brought to 2057. [...] Many descriptions of Princess Arjumand in this book point back to how she might or should have perished in the Thames but was now alive through an action that occurred and its improbability, alluding specifically to the paradox created in the thought experiment that is created by Schrödinger's cat.|$|E
