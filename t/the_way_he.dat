5|$|According to Carlson, Schwa {{struggles to}} break even in most weeks. Salaries at Schwa are modest, but food costs make up an astronomical 60% of the take-in. Carlson {{has said he would}} rather cook and run his {{restaurant}} <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> wants than make money, and has rejected buyout offers and calls for expansion.|$|E

5|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpsons's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. As the race closed in on the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture, and for a while, Simpson managed {{to stay in the}} front group of elite riders. He then slipped back to a group of chasers around one minute behind before he began to lose control of his bike and zig-zag across the road. His team manager, Alec Taylor, feared for Simpson less for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> was going up the mountain than for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> would go down the other side.|$|E

5|$|Australian openside David Pocock, who {{was also}} shortlisted for the IRB award, admires <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> reads the game {{as well as his}} ability to read the referee. One of McCaw's {{strengths}} is his ability to re-invent himself. For example, he adapted quickly to changes in the breakdown laws (e.g., the 2008 the Experimental Law Variations (ELVS) and the 2010 New IRB Law Interpretations) and, over time, other areas of his game.|$|E

5|$|Brubaker {{received}} {{calls from}} interested parties in Hollywood about adapting The Fade Out {{very early in}} its publication. However, {{he did not want}} to sell the rights until the series was finished. He had done so with a previous work, and it affected <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> wrote it because he was imagining it in the other medium.|$|E

5|$|Daniels' {{support for}} such {{controversial}} legislation {{led to a}} rapid drop in his approval rating; in May 2005, a poll showed an 18-point drop in support and that only 42% of Hoosiers approved of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> was doing his job. In the following months, many of his reforms began {{to have a positive}} effect; and his ratings began to improve, and his approval rebounded.|$|E
5|$|Dunderdale was the Progressive Conservative Candidate in the {{district}} of Fortune-Hermitage in the 1993 provincial election. Dunderdale ran against Liberal cabinet minister Oliver Langdon, and while she knew she would not win the election she felt she had to send premier Clyde Wells a message about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> was treating municipalities. In the 1995 Progressive Conservative leadership election Dunderdale served as co-chair of Lynn Verge's successful campaign.|$|E
5|$|Heber {{remained}} in Bombay for four months, {{and then decided}} that, instead of sailing directly for Calcutta, he would visit Ceylon on <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>He</b> arrived at Galle on 25 August and spent five weeks touring the main cities before departing for Calcutta where he arrived on 19 October 1825 after an absence of 16 months.|$|E

5|$|However, {{there is}} another {{significant}} difference in Napoleon himself, in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> holds himself. David's Napoleon is flamboyant, confident in his leadership of the French army, and {{in his ability to}} cross the Alps and defeat the Austrians in Italy. Delaroche's Napoleon is instead downcast, gaunt and embittered by the harsh cold. His eyes and expressionless face evidence his weariness, his tiredness a result of the long and unstable trek.|$|E
5|$|If {{you please}} Sir I am a widow; & I think it very wrong {{that there is}} not any Mrs. Fisher, but I would not marry Mr. Jeremy not for worlds, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> does live in that house all slippy-sloppy; not any lady would stand it, & not a bit of good {{starching}} his cravats.|$|E

5|$|It {{became a}} game, with Feiffer {{trying to draw}} things <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> wanted, and Juster trying to {{describe}} things that were impossible to sketch. These included the Triple Demons of Compromiseâ€”one short and fat, one tall and thin, and the third exactly like the first two. Feiffer got his revenge by depicting the author as the Whether Man, clad in a toga.|$|E
5|$|Judah {{returns to}} Judea. Along <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>he</b> meets Balthasar (Finlay Currie) and an Arab, Sheik Ilderim (Hugh Griffith).

Judah declines, even after he learns that Messala will also compete.|$|E
5|$|Lewis' {{presence}} on the Street infuriates Gail, who still holds a grudge for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> treated Audrey. Gail hopes Lewis may have left for good when he attends court on charges of fraud. However, Lewis charms the judge with a speech about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> let Audrey down, and he is sentenced to community service. The animosity between Gail and Lewis, reaches a peak at The Bisto; and as Audrey defends Lewis, a food critic from the Weatherfield Gazette walks in. A show spokesperson told Inside Soap's Katy Moon that Lewis turns on the charm and quickly wins the reviewer over. Audrey's grandson Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), who owns The Bistro, realises Lewis' communication skills could be good for his business and he employs Lewis for a trial period at the restaurant.|$|E

5|$|Some conversations, due {{to their}} private nature, were fictionalized; Ottaviani makes up Marsh's lobby to Congress and what {{happened}} during his meeting with President Grant, and P.T. Barnum never told off Marsh <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> did in the novel. Ottaviani also wove the story Marsh tells about the Mastodon from several {{different versions of the}} legend.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Knight was marched {{towards the}} Shawnee towns, {{where he was}} to be executed. Along <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>he</b> struck his guard with a log and managed to escape.
