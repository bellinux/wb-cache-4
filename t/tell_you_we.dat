500|$|Springsteen himself {{remained}} quite {{interested in}} his and the band's commercial fortunes. [...] He said before the tour's start that remaining popular {{had been one of}} his motivations for the Super Bowl appearance: [...] "I've said no for about 10 years or however long they've been asking, but, I <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>we</b> played on the last tour and there were some empty seats here and there and, well, there shouldn't be any empty seats at an E Street Band show. I hold pride that we remain one of the great wonders of the world ... so sometimes you got to remind people a little bit." ...|$|E
500|$|Washington D.C. mayor Marion Barry, Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley, President Jimmy Carter all {{expressed}} {{support for}} the ordinance. In The Miami Herald, 51members of Dutch Parliament, ministers, and civil rights advocates from the Netherlands ran a full-page ad stating [...] "We, {{from the land of}} Anne Frank, know where prejudices and discrimination can lead to", advising the voters of Miami-Dade to uphold the ordinance {{to protect the rights of}} homosexuals. California Assemblyman Willie Brown and San Francisco sheriff Richard Hongisto campaigned respectively for Miami's black community and law enforcement. Hongisto returned to California saying that Save Our Children made an issue of the existence of San Francisco when Thompson referred to the city as [...] "a cesspool of perversion gone rampant" [...] and Bob Green expressed doubt that saving San Francisco was possible. Reverend Jerry Falwell spoke at a rally as the vote neared, telling the audience, [...] "I want to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>we</b> are dealing with a vile and vicious and vulgar gang. They'd kill you as quick as look at you." ...|$|E
500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>we</b> were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E
6000|$|They {{exploded}} into blasphemy. The breath of angry men smoked into his placid face. A gnarled, grimy fist vibrated {{at the end}} of his nose. [...] "We <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> <b>we</b> want noan o' thee. Get thou back where thou com'st from." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nay," [...] quoth Robin, [...] "thou mightst go thine own way {{but for one}} thing, {{and that}} I will <b>tell</b> <b>thee.</b> <b>We</b> keep an inn, as it were, in the very depths of Sherwood, but so far from highroads and beaten paths that guests do not often come nigh us; so I and my friends set off merrily and seek them when we grow dull of ourselves. Thus the matter stands, Sir Knight; yet I will {{furthermore}} <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> that <b>we</b> count upon our guests paying a reckoning." ...|$|R
2500|$|Philosopher Slavoj Žižek gave {{a speech}} on Wall Street in which he {{expressed}} support for the protests saying, [...] "They <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>we</b> are dreamers. The true dreamers are those who think things can go on indefinitely the way they are. We are not dreamers. We are awakening from a dream which is turning into a nightmare." ...|$|E
2500|$|The phrase [...] "chuffed to one's bollocks" [...] {{describes}} {{someone who}} is very pleased with himself. [...] Nobel laureate Harold Pinter used this in The Homecoming The phrase provided a serious challenge to translators of his work. Pinter used a similar phrase in an open letter, published in The Guardian, and addressed to Prime Minister Tony Blair, attacking his co-operation with American foreign policy. The letter ends by saying [...] "Oh, by the way, meant to mention, forgot to <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>we</b> were all chuffed to the bollocks when Labour won the election".|$|E

6000|$|... "Thou liest like {{a wicked}} {{woman of the}} Pale faces, as thou art! Nipset was only a boy on that path, but he went with his people. I <b>tell</b> <b>thee,</b> <b>we</b> singed the very 'arth with our brands, and not a head of them all ever rose again from the ashes." ...|$|R
60|$|Vent. You must kiss it then; for I must <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>we</b> {{have chosen}} him duke, {{in a full}} assembly.|$|E
60|$|SPINTHO. Don't say that. That's blasphemy. Don't say that, I <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> <b>We</b> {{shall be}} saved, no matter WHAT we do.|$|E

In that very fight for that little village of which I have been <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>we</b> were {{fighting}} for the shelter of those old houses as much as victory. And with the French it was the same.|$|R
5000|$|The film did {{not achieve}} the {{financial}} success that she'd hoped for. Disappointed with the creative constraints of filmmaking, she began writing novels. ("In a novel, no one <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>we</b> don't have {{the budget to}} blow up a four-story building. Heck, blow up a twelve story building instead! It's only two more letters!") ...|$|R

6000|$|... “Be still,” said George; “you {{must not}} do so. I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>we</b> must not mix them at all.” And he poured the apples out upon the ground again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Friend,' replied Joshua, with a {{constrained}} smile, 'but that I know thou dost {{not mean}} as thou sayst, I would <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> <b>we</b> {{are under the}} protection of this country's laws; nor do we the less trust to obtain their protection, that our principles permit us not, by any act of violent resistance, to protect ourselves.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why should I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what <b>we</b> know so well?' {{returned}} Kate soothingly. 'Nicholas--dear Nicholas--how can {{you give}} way thus?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ferguson, how heedless I am. I fully {{intended}} to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>we</b> {{did not wish}} to buy any silks to-day, and I also {{intended to}} <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>we</b> yearned to go immediately to the palace of the Louvre, but enjoying the happiness of seeing you devour four breakfasts this morning has so filled me with pleasurable emotions that I neglect the commonest interests of the time.
