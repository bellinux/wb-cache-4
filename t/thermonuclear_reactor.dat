40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe high-speed ballistic injection {{of a solid}} spherical pellet of deuterium-tritium ice into a magnetically confined <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> plasma has been suggested as a technique of controlled <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> fueling. This experiment {{is intended to be}} a preliminary test of the feasibility of accelerating macroscopic fuel pellets using a pulsed ruby laser operating in the conventional mode. Pellet velocities in the range of 1, 000 - 10, 000 m/sec are required to enable the pellets to penetrate and effectively refuel the reactor plasma. In this study, cellulose acetate pellets were used to simulate deuterium-tritium fuel. When placed in a vacuum enclosed tube, they were accelerated by the reaction to the laser induced ablation cloud from the exposed half of the pellet. Pellet velocities of over 200 m/sec were achieved. The velocities were measured by stroboscopic photography, and the pellets were weighed to determine the fraction ablated.
