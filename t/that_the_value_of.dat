5|$|In a 16 December statement, three Stabæk Fotball {{officials}} said that they suspected that Ulrichen's plan all along was to convert the venue to a pure convention center, and that the use as a football venue was a decoy to get a free lot worth up to NOK200 million plus grants worth NOK50 million. The book value of the venue was NOK303 million {{at the end of}} 2010, although a statement from the district court stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the venue was significantly lower than that. The bank DnB NOR held at the time a mortgage with security in the property worth NOK260 million, while Ulrichsen through his investment company held a mortgage worth NOK60.1 million.|$|E
5|$|Many {{national}} and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have {{lower interest rates}} than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency {{with low levels of}} inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.|$|E
5|$|Taking a {{negative}} real number b to a rational power u/v, where u/v is in lowest terms, yields a positive real result if u is even, and hence v is odd, because then b'u is positive; and yields {{a negative}} real result, if u and v are both odd, because then b'u is negative. The case of odd u and even v cannot be treated this way within the reals, {{since there is}} no real number x such <b>that</b> , <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> b'u/v in this case must use the imaginary unit i, as described more fully in the section § Powers of complex numbers.|$|E

Since v(x, 0)=u_xx(x, 0), <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> v {{is also known}} at t= 0. Also, note <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> u and v are given at x=a and x=b.|$|R

5|$|The above {{explanations}} all {{place the}} causeway within a Roman military context. An alternative, or perhaps secondary, usage for the causeway in Roman times {{is suggested by}} landscape author Michael Dunn and others, who state {{that it may have}} been constructed for the transport of jet inland from Whitby. Hayes and Rutter are dismissive, stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> jet mined in the Roman period would not have justified the expense of the causeway's construction.|$|E
5|$|Archimedes {{was able}} to use infinitesimals {{in a way that is}} similar to modern {{integral}} calculus. Through proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the method of exhaustion, and he employed it to approximate the value of π. In Measurement of a Circle he did this by drawing a larger regular hexagon outside a circle and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon, calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he {{was able to}} determine <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> π lay between 3 (approximately 3.1429) and 3 (approximately 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416. He also proved that the area of a circle was equal to π multiplied by the square of the radius of the circle (πr2). In On the Sphere and Cylinder, Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude. This is the Archimedean property of real numbers.|$|E
5|$|Legal {{disputes}} {{carried on}} for years, {{exacerbated by the}} fact that Marsh owned land near Van Cortlandt Park in particular. Opponents argued that building a park system would divert funds from more important infrastructure like schools and docks; that everyone in the city, instead of just the property owners near the proposed park, was required to pay taxes to pay for the parks' construction; and that since Marsh was trying to parcel off some of his land to developers, the park's size should be reduced in order to prevent him from profiting off park usage. However, most of this opposition was directed at the construction of Pelham Bay Park, which was then in Westchester. Supporters argued that the parks were for the benefit of all the city's citizens, thus justifying the citywide park tax; <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> properties near the parks would appreciate greatly over time; that the Commission had only chosen property that could easily be converted into a park; and that Pelham Bay Park would soon be annexed to the city. Ultimately, the parks were established despite the objections of major figures like Mayors William Russell Grace and Abram Hewitt; Comptroller Edward V. Loew; and Assemblymen Henry Bergh and Theodore Roosevelt.|$|E

5|$|The first Sky {{television}} rights {{agreement was}} worth £304million over five seasons. The next contract, negotiated {{to start from}} the 1997–98 season, rose to £670million over four seasons. The third contract was a £1.024billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001–02 to 2003–04. The league brought in £320million {{from the sale of}} its international rights for the three-year period from 2004–05 to 2006–07. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis. Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid a total of £1.7billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on Match of the Day) for £171.6million, a 63percent increase on the £105million it paid for the previous three-year period. Sky and BT have agreed to jointly pay £84.3million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10pm on matchday. Overseas television rights fetched £625million, nearly double the previous contract. The total raised from these deals is more than £2.7billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.|$|E
