5|$|In 1187 Walter, {{along with}} Glanvill and King Henry II, {{attempted}} to mediate a {{dispute between the}} Archbishop of Canterbury, Baldwin of Forde, and the monks of the cathedral chapter. Their efforts were fruitless, and Walter was later drawn back into the dispute, in early 1189 and again as archbishop. The dispute centred on the attempt by Baldwin to build a church dedicated to Saint Thomas Becket, just outside the town of Canterbury. The plan was to staff the church with canons instead of monks, which the monks of Canterbury's cathedral chapter feared was an attempt <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> cathedral chapter's right to elect the archbishop. The attempt in 1189 was settled by Baldwin giving up the site near Canterbury for one further away at Lambeth, which was less threatening to the monks.|$|E
25|$|As {{the legal}} {{basis of the}} forced {{separation}} of families and children served the Swiss Civil Code (Zivilgesetzbuch) of 1912, by – at misfeasance behavior of parents, permanent risk or, more generally, neglect – the guardianship authorities were empowered, parents <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> custody of their children. Although the Civil Code mentioned a supervision over {{the work of the}} authorities, it was widely ignored. Although the welfare authorities possessed the right parents to escape custody, such as the supervision in the mass application of the laws of the article, was nowhere determined. Crucial and sufficient was the 'legal fact', that the children were members of a traveling (Yenish) family, and thus a sufficient reason, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> children from their parents.|$|E

25|$|Emma, Hook {{and their}} guest return to see Rumplestiltskin {{in the hopes}} that he can open the time portal, but instead he tells them that only they can re-open it because only the people who came through the portal can re-open it, but they need to wield magic. Rumple gives Emma a wand and tells her to open the portal if she has magic, but she doesn't think she can. Rumple decides he’d rather forget {{everything}} he’s learned so as not to alter his future, then he sends Emma and Hook to a dark vault where he keeps dangerous and unpredictable magic, where their Storybrooke outfits are restored. Hook says that Emma still has some magic in her and after seeing what happened to her parents and realizing everything Henry did to bring her to Storybrooke, she's ready to return home. Hook and Emma then notice the wand lights up with magic and open up the portal, allowing Hook and the woman to escape first. Before she can leave, Rumple holds on to Emma and demands to know what happened to Baelfire/Neal. Emma tells him what happened, then she begs him not <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> fact he died a hero. Rumplestiltskin drinks the forgetting potion and lets go of Emma where she is pulled into the portal, which sends her, Hook, and the woman back to Storybrooke.|$|E

In this context, judicial independence refers to the judiciary's independence from the legislative and executive branches of the government. Singapore's judiciary enjoys a certain measure of independence provided by various constitutional safeguards such as security of tenure and remuneration. Judges are also relatively free from executive and legislative influence. A retired Supreme Court judge, L.P. Thean, has said that it is theoretically possible for the executive to make political appointments to the Bench, to reduce a judge's remuneration by amending the Constitution, or <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> judiciary's vital support staff, but [...] "he fact remains, however, that nothing of that kind has ever been done".|$|E
500|$|... "After Tonight" [...] was a song Carey {{wrote with}} David Foster and Diane Warren. Carey had strong {{feelings}} about the song, as she wrote it about her relationship with Luis Miguel. The song was compared instrumentally to [...] "My All" [...] from Butterfly, which features traces of Latin and guitar instrumentation. In the lyrics, the protagonist asks her lover if he will still love her {{and come back to}} her [...] "after tonight." [...] Carey's cover of the Phil Collins song [...] "Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)" [...] was originally intended to be a solo ballad. The song was re-done after the album was released, with music by the Irish band Westlife replacing the song's instrumental bridge. [...] "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)" [...] was one of the album's most uplifting ballads, lyrically serving as an anthem for fans and listeners. The message, Carey said, was a personal theme of hers growing up, of not letting others [...] "bring her down" [...] and not allowing them <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> light inside her.|$|E

500|$|Gordon and Silver {{moved the}} project to Warner Bros., where Terry Gilliam was {{attached}} to direct. Unsatisfied with how Hamm's script fleshed out the characters, Gilliam brought in Charles McKeown to rewrite it. The second draft, which was credited to Gilliam, Warren Skaaren, and Hamm rather than McKeown, used the character Rorschach's journal as a voice-over, and restored scenes from the comic book that Hamm had removed. According to Watchmen artist Dave Gibbons, filming was to take place at Pinewood Studios. Silver wanted to cast Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dr. Manhattan. Because both Gilliam and Silver's previous films, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen and Die Hard 2 respectively, went over budget, they were only able to raise $25 million for the film—a quarter of the necessary budget. As a result, Gilliam abandoned the project, and ultimately decided that Watchmen was unfilmable. Gilliam explained, [...] "Reducing [...] to a two or two-and-a-half hour film [...] seemed to me <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> essence of what Watchmen is about." [...] When Warner Bros. dropped the project, Gordon invited Gilliam back to helm the film independently. The director again declined, believing that the comic book would be better directed as a five-hour miniseries.|$|E
500|$|Roddenberry {{explained}} to Whitney {{that he wanted}} Rand to be Captain Kirk's confidante but never wanted them to express their affection for one another, instead {{he wanted it to}} be played as an ongoing undercurrent. In the early publicity photos, Whitney was dressed in the same manner that the women had been in the two pilots – a loose gold colored tunic and black trousers. She complained to Roddenberry about them hiding her [...] "dancer's legs", so he had William Ware Theiss design a short skirt and tunic for her to wear, a uniform which was adopted by the other female characters on the series. She said the outfit was [...] "sensational" [...] and that [...] "it stopped traffic". Despite the outfit being designed specifically for Whitney, Theiss was concerned and would tell her to lose weight. She was subsequently prescribed amphetamines by her doctor, for the purpose of weight loss. Whitney stated that this was the start of her addiction to them, and in order to come down off them at night, she began drinking in the evening <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> [...] "edginess".|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after the}} race, Oxford's bow man, Alex Woods, {{collapsed}} and lost consciousness. [...] After receiving treatment {{on the bank}} of the river, he was taken to Charing Cross Hospital, where he made a complete recovery. [...] Oxford's coach Sean Bowden suggested that the loss of one of Oxford's blades had driven Woods to push himself [...] "beyond his limits". [...] As a result of the disruption and the concern for Woods' condition, the traditional award ceremony was cancelled. [...] Woods later apologised to the Cambridge crew and coach for his collapse that [...] "prevented their celebrations" [...] while thanking them for their [...] "sportsmanlike behaviour". Cambridge boat club president Nelson said [...] "I feel bad. Finishing the race there was a lot of raw emotion and some of the celebrations seem pathetic in retrospect" [...] while his coach Steve Trapmore commented [...] "it's not the way anyone wants <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> win". [...] Oxford cox Zoe de Toledo made a request that the race be re-rowed as a result of the broken blade, but the appeal was dismissed by umpire Garrett, who said [...] "I listened to Oxford’s complaint but I explained I did not see the clash as being the reason for the eventual result".|$|E

500|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} attempts {{to make a film}} version of Watchmen since 1986, when producers Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver acquired film rights to the series for 20th Century Fox. Fox asked Alan Moore to write a screenplay based on his story, but he declined, so the studio enlisted screenwriter Sam Hamm. Hamm took the liberty of re-writing Watchmens complicated ending into a [...] "more manageable" [...] conclusion involving an assassination and a time paradox. Fox put the project into turnaround in 1991, and the project was moved to Warner Bros., where Terry Gilliam was attached to direct and Charles McKeown to rewrite it.

500|$|The album's title, Nimrod, is {{the name}} of a {{character}} from the Bible that in American English became a term for a stupid or dimwitted person. After three art directors were rejected by the band and pressing was behind schedule, Green Day asked the help of Chris Bilheimer, a friend of Armstrong who had done covers for another group signed by Warner Bros. Records, R.E.M. Having just the album title to work on, Bilheimer had some ideas, with the one that went through being inspired by a photograph Bilheimer saw, where a politician’s poster had had his face removed. He felt the image was [...] "striking" [...] and seemed to fit the band by featuring [...] "a typical middle-age male, corporate politician American kind of guy, and someone had completely taken his identity away through vandalism." [...] Following that line of thought, Bilheimer took an encyclopedia picture of men in suits and ties and put colored circles reading [...] "nimrod." [...] on their faces, [...] "using that <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> people's identity".
