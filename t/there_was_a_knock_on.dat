60|$|Without {{another word}} Hal {{pocketed}} the bills. As {{he did so}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the door, then it was flung open and a girl rushed in.|$|E
6000|$|When we {{had nearly}} {{finished}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the door, and Kate admitted Mr. Woodward's errand boy. He had a note for me. It contained {{but a single}} sentence:-- ...|$|E
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> at the door. Monsieur le propriétaire {{presented}} himself.|$|R

60|$|Presently <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the door, and Mrs. Corcoran {{opened it}} to admit Squire Paget. The head man of the village wore a look of hypocritical sympathy upon his sharp features.|$|E
60|$|Presently <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> {{the door}} of his room and Blair entered. Blair, as always, bright of eye, smiling of lip, erect, proud, self-sufficient, inscrutable and sure. Lane's black demon stole away. Lane saw that Blair was whiter, thinner, frailer, a little farther on that road from which there could be no turning.|$|E
60|$|Not being satisfied, I {{began to}} examine this roof and the clay walls, which I forgot to mention were painted over {{in a kind of}} pattern with whorls in it, by the feeble light of the {{primitive}} lamps. While I was thus engaged <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the door. Forgetting all about the dust, I opened it and Hans appeared.|$|E
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> at the door, and Burgard entered, {{removing}} his cap.|$|R

60|$|At {{this moment}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> at the door, and the baron entered.|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> his door, and in {{response}} to his summons to enter the door opened, and there stood before him the young man of his recent encounter upon the street. The latter entered softly, closing the door behind him. His feet made no sound upon the carpet, and no sound came from the door as he closed it, nor any slightest click from the latch. His utter silence and the stealth of his movements were so pronounced as to attract immediate attention. He did not speak until he had reached {{the center of the room}} and halted on the opposite side of the table at which Jimmy was standing; and then a very slow smile moved his lips, though the expression of his eyes remained unchanged.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are so {{many things}} that she doesn't understand," [...] he reflected, glancing at the letter to Cassandra which he had begun and laid aside. What {{prevented}} him from finishing the letter which he had so much enjoyed beginning? The reason was that Katharine might, at any moment, enter the room. The thought, implying his bondage to her, irritated him acutely. It occurred to him that he would leave the letter lying open for her to see, and he would take the opportunity of telling her that he had sent his play to Cassandra for her to criticize. Possibly, but not by any means certainly, this would annoy her--and as he reached the doubtful comfort of this conclusion, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the door and Katharine came in. They kissed each other coldly and she made no apology for being late. Nevertheless, her mere presence moved him strangely; but he was determined that this should not weaken his resolution to make some kind of stand against her; to get at the truth about her. He let her make her own disposition of clothes and busied himself with the plates.|$|E

50|$|Three months later, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> Sarah Jane’s door. A packet {{containing}} a china doll was left for her. Unknown to Sarah, Joe {{had worked for}} three months to buy the doll. This time Sarah obeyed her mother’s instruction {{not to take the}} doll to school. Years later, Joe and Sarah laugh about the story.|$|E
50|$|At 10:30pm on 31 July 2009, Tursunov was at {{his home}} in the Yangi-Abad {{district}} when <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> his door. His son answered the door, and was told his father was being invited to a religious function. When Tursunov came to the door, he was stabbed eight times by three men - five times in the arm, and three times in the stomach. The attackers then fled the scene.|$|E
50|$|Jack Douglas and Joe Baker spent {{ten years}} touring the world, playing in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa amongst other places. Coming back to Britain again, {{they did a}} season at a Butlin's holiday camp and not liking the food served there, Jack cooked in their chalet (which was forbidden) {{for both of them}} and another. One evening <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the door and Billy Butlin was {{standing}} there. He noticed the smell and asked if they had enough for four. They did and he ate with them.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the night}} of 1 April into the morning of 2 April 2016, along the northeastern part of the Artsakh-Azerbaijan contact line, units of Azerbaijani Armed Forces carried out {{large-scale}} attacks against the Armenian side. Captain Kirakosyan {{at the time was}} living with his wife and children in the Mataghis village of Martakert. His wife, Mariam, said that during the night, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> their bedroom window, from which they both woke up and it was understood that they needed to get their children out of the village immediately. Hovsep's wife asked him to escape with her, but he said, [...] "No, I am sorry, I can't. I have 25 soldiers, I have to be by their side. If anything happens to them, how am I going to look at their parents in the eyes?" [...] Hovsep's wife, Mariam, and their two young sons escaped from the village.|$|E
50|$|The {{sad story}} of Chitomborwizi is that mostly farms are {{inherited}} {{from one generation}} to another. However most beneficiaries lack the skills and funds to become successful farmers. Some end up selling the farms or simply leave the farm lying idle. Then <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> effect of the economic meltdown alluded earlier on; the next generation of beneficiaries(new owners) are no longer residing on farms. The few young people who did not migrate to other countries have gone to the city in search of better living conditions and a guaranteed monthly paycheck. This has turned most farms into a place where people come and meet during bereavements to bury their beloved ones. There is a real danger that next generation are not going to take farming as a serious business, some of the blame have to be shoved to government policies. There is little or no professional and financial support provided to farmers in Chitomborwizi. Problems affecting Chitomborwizi farmers are different from those of government's controversial land reform as the former have title deeds.|$|E
50|$|Rosie {{found her}} way home and after {{sleeping}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the door. She saw what looked like two terrifying monsters through the letter box. She then heard the Finders voices call and she let them in but they still frightened her. After some coaxing Rosie realized that the monsters were in fact the Finders. Mr Ikbal explained that she had become more Djinn like and could see them as something frightening because Djinn hate angels. Ikbal suggested they should eat to keep their strength up and after their meal Rosie disguised herself as a man and set off on her bike for the address on the parcel as Ikbal suggested. Rosie cycled to Boglin with the Finders flying behind. On the way the Moon appeared to sing and summon her. The Finders stopped her from flying then told her that Djinn were attracted to the Moon and {{told her not to}} look at it. When they reached Boglin Rosie knocked on a door and asked the elderly man for directions to Gallows Tree Cottage. He told her it was occupied by Miss Kittie and Miss Rooke who baked cakes and were friendly with the villagers. On the way Ikbal pointed out that Kittie is a pet name for a cat and a rook is a kind of crow which were the two animals found near a Djinn. When they reached the cottage Ikbal could feel the presence of the Djinn but told Rosie {{that she would have to}} go in alone as the Finders could not arrest the Djinn until midnight.|$|E
