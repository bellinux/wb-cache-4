5|$|A pretrial show cause {{hearing in}} the Green case began in January 1996, with Green {{represented}} by Dennis Moore and Kevin Moriarty. Green's defense claimed that <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family home had been set not by Debora Green, but by her son, Tim Farrar, {{who had once been}} caught by local police setting off Molotov cocktails. The defense also attempted to attribute Farrar's poisoning to Tim, who did much of the cooking in the household.|$|E
5|$|Friday {{morning the}} wind shifted again, {{this time to}} the north. The {{firefighting}} finally started to show some semblance of organization, and efforts were waged to stop <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighborhood around Magstræde. This failed, though, when the fire took the soap factory on Magstræde around noon. The wind was now blowing northwest and the firefighting moved via Snaregade to Nybrogade, Naboløs and Gammel Strand, but failed to save Nybrogade.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October, United {{lost their}} fourth-consecutive match, making it their longest losing streak since August 2010. Playing Chicago, United took a 1–0 {{lead in the}} 90th minute thanks to a penalty kick from De Rosario. The slight goal lead seemed certain to return United back into a playoff {{position}} for only Chicago's Sebastián Grazzini and Diego Cháves to score for <b>the</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third and fifth minutes of stoppage time, respectively. Despite the loss, United barely remained in the playoff chance. On 19 October, United hosted the Portland Timbers. With the match ending in a 1–1 draw, United failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs for a team-record fourth-consecutive season. United concluded the regular season on 22 October with a 0–1 home loss to Sporting Kansas City.|$|E

5|$|The {{electric}} {{fire engine}} would have several advantages over the steam fire engine. One {{was that an}} electric fire engine could be brought eto full power immediately, whereas a steam fire engine took time. It was necessary to keep the fire going {{all the time to}} boil the water on a steam pump vehicle, with workmen furnishing coal for it. This was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting the water to boil to produce steam to run the water pump to extinguish <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of an electric motor running a fire engine water pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full power capacity when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Torch {{is brought}} into the stadium, passed from athlete to athlete during the torch relay, until it reaches the last carrier; often a {{well-known}} athlete from the host nation, who lights <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stadium's cauldron. Under IOC rules, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron must be witnessed by those attending the opening ceremony, implying {{that it must be}} lit at the location where the ceremony is taking place. Another IOC rule states that the cauldron should be witnessed outside by the entire residents of the entire host city. This was made evident during the opening ceremony for the 2010 Games in Vancouver. The venue chosen as the Olympic Stadium was BC Place, which at the time was an air-supported domed stadium. Since there was no way the cauldron could be displayed outside and also be seen at the stadium, two cauldrons were used. For the first torch lighting inside the stadium the organizers chose three-time speed skating medalist Catriona Le May Doan, Canadian Senator Nancy Greene, who won two medals for Canada at the 1968 Games, NBA star Steve Nash, a native of nearby Victoria, and hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, to each light one of four arms of the torch. Notably, Le May Doan's arm refused to light; this was later rectified during the closing ceremony when she got a second chance to light her part of the torch and succeeded.|$|E
5|$|Having {{escaped the}} {{buildings}} {{in a variety}} of ways (including through doors and out of windows), some students found themselves impeded by a river that adjoined the school. However, some were able to use rowing boats as a means of escape. Saari started fires at several other locations within the school buildings, and <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> exam room damaged some of the bodies so badly that they had to be identified from DNA and dental records. Nine of the victims were found in the exam room, and one in a nearby corridor. It was later ascertained that this student had fled the burning classroom and then died in the corridor. Eight of the victims were female students, one a male student, and one a male member of staff. All of the students killed were in their 20s, and the teacher was in his 50s. A 21-year-old woman was shot in the head but had two operations in the days after sustaining her injury, and was reported as being in a satisfactory condition. A further ten students were treated for minor injuries including sprains and cuts from broken glass. All the victims were classmates of Saari's. Saari was originally from Pohjois-Pohjanmaa, but lived in Kauhajoki where he was enrolled on his catering course at the college. It was later revealed that the male student was probably a close friend of Saari's. The pair had spent an evening out together in February 2008 when they were threatened with a starter pistol. A photo of them together had been circulating on the Internet, in which Saari jokingly points at his friend's head with his forefinger. The names of the other victims were withheld by police.|$|E
