5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>him.</b> I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E
5|$|Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) waits nervously for {{an answer}} from his girlfriend, Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer), about going into witness {{protection}} with him. He states {{that it is too}} dangerous for him to stay in Erinsborough and that she can bring her younger sister, Sophie (Kaiya Jones), with them. Kate tells Mark that she does not want <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>him</b> and agrees to go. Mark reveals that they only have half an hour and heads over to his house to pack. Sophie returns home and Kate tells her that they are leaving town that night. An upset Sophie explains that she cannot pack her life up in a bag and refuses to go. Kate tells her the decision has already been made and they are leaving. As Mark is wondering whether to call his parents, his housemate, Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita), arrives home unexpectedly. When she enquires about his bag, he tells her he needs a change of clothes for a double shift. Kate finds Mark and asks for more time, but Mark tells her they do not have any. He gives her the details of the meeting point and they kiss, before Kate leaves him.|$|E
5|$|Willis {{returned}} in early 1971 to help Surrey win the 1971 County Championship title. However, friction was developing between {{the club and}} himself. During that season Willis took 31 Championship wickets at 28.83, but found himself unable to accept the contract offered {{to him by the}} club. Though the county was reluctant <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>him,</b> Willis sought another club. He took two wickets in his final match for Surrey against Hampshire on 11 September 1971. After turning down Leicestershire and Lancashire he signed for Warwickshire, for whom he had immediate success, with 25 wickets at 29.28, including one five-wicket haul (taking five wickets in one innings). Willis, who under rules then applying was banned from playing for his new county before July, helped Warwickshire win the 1972 Championship, thus achieving the unusual feat of winning the Championship in consecutive years with two different counties. In his final match of the season, he took 8/44 to dismantle Derbyshire. His new team won nine of their 20 matches, drew 11 and lost none. He was not selected for the 1972 Ashes series in England, and travelled to South Africa as part of Derrick Robins' invitation XI in January. On the tour Willis took 13 wickets from the six matches.|$|E

25|$|When Lamptey was eight, {{his parents}} divorced, and his {{stepfather}} {{threw him out}} of the household. Lamptey found refuge in a Muslim football camp and converted from Christianity to Islam to qualify for entry. When his stepfather found this out, he accused his stepson of sacrilege and often quarreled in front of the football camp. But soon, it became evident what talent young Lamptey had, and he was called up to Ghana's junior squads. He was eventually reconciled with his father – and readopted Christianity – in 1997, only <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>him</b> to an alcohol-related illness.|$|E

25|$|At 11:30, Tyrwhitt's {{squadron}} {{came upon}} another German cruiser, Mainz and the ships engaged for 20 minutes, {{before the arrival}} of Goodenough caused Mainz to attempt an escape. Goodenough gave chase and in trying <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>him,</b> Mainz came back across the path of Arethusa and her destroyers. Her steering was damaged, causing her to turn back into the path of Goodenough's ships and she was hit by shells and torpedo. At 12:20, her captain ordered his ship to be scuttled and the crew to abandon ship. Keyes had now joined the main body of ships and brought Lurcher alongside Mainz to take off the crew. Three British destroyers had been seriously damaged in the engagement.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1931, Bradman seriously {{contemplated}} playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington. The media in England and Australia hotly debated {{the consequences of a}} move that would end Bradman's Test career. Bradman was advised by the Board of Control that if he played cricket in England in 1932, it would be another breach of his 1930 tour contract and therefore he would not be considered for Test selection if he went ahead with the deal. Public opinion divided: Australian cricket could not afford <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>him</b> and some thought he was selling his birthright, but {{at the height of the}} Depression, working-class people empathised with Bradman. The opportunity to earn over £1000 per annum was very tempting to a young man without a profession.|$|E
25|$|At the President's insistence, Ellie {{agrees to}} meet with two {{religious}} leaders, Billy Jo Rankin and Palmer Joss. A lifelong religious skeptic, Ellie tries to convince Joss of her faith in science by standing near a heavy Foucault pendulum and trusting that its amplitude will not increase. Although dismissing Rankin's outbursts, Ellie is intrigued by Joss' worldview. Shortly after, Ellie travels to Paris to discuss the machine with a newly formed consortium. The participants reach a consensus that the machine is a dodecahedron shaped vehicle with five seats. At the conference, Ellie meets Devi Sukhavati, a doctor who left India to marry the man she loved, only <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>him</b> to illness a year later. The final piece of the message is discovered when S. R. Hadden, a billionaire in multiple high-tech industries with an obsessive personal interest {{in the concept of}} immortality, suggests that Ellie check for phase modulation.

25|$|In late 2007, Tania {{became friends}} with Joey Henderson during the 'Ferndale Strangler' storyline and became dangerously close to {{becoming}} one of his victims after she told Alice Piper {{that he was just}} a 'boy' and she wasn't interested in dating him. When Joey overheard this, he was revealed to be the Ferndale Strangler in the 2007 Christmas cliffhanger with him preparing to strangle Tania with IV tubing inside her apartment. When Tania cut her finger with a knife, Joey panicked and put the IV line away, with her narrowly avoiding death without even knowing it. After this he stalked her in a shopping mall and hoped to kidnap her by offering her a lift but Yvonne picked her up and took her up north for Christmas. Joey missed his chance, and once again Tania avoided death unknowingly. Tania dated both Kip Denton (Will Hall) and Hone Ropata (Temuera Morrison) before she began an abusive relationship with gang member Kingi Te Wake (Te Kohe Tuhaka). Kingi left her and Tania dated Ben Goodall (Shaun Edwards-Brown), only <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>him</b> to her mother. Ben was assaulted by a small gang of hoodlums and later it was discovered he had a brain hemorrhage. He fell brain dead and after several arguments between Yvonne and his sister Anita (Lara Fischel-Chisholm) as to whether he would come back alive or not, his life support was turned off a week later. Tania was very upset over his death and she and Yvonne reunited. She rebounded with Isaac Worthington (Matt Minto) but left him when he cheated on her. In late 2010 {{she fell in love with}} Rafe Durville (Simon London) and left the country with him to Australia to start a clinic. She returned briefly in 2012 for Yvonne's birthday. In 2013, Bella Durville (Amelia Reid-Meredith) visited Tania and Rafe.|$|E

While many disaffected conservatives may have voted for Ross Perot to protest Bush's tax increase, further examination of the Perot vote in the Election Night exit polls not only showed that Perot siphoned votes nearly equally among Bush and Clinton, but of the voters who cited Bush's broken [...] "No New Taxes" [...] pledge as [...] "very important," [...] two thirds voted for Bill Clinton.|$|E

500|$|... "The Man Trap" [...] {{appeared}} in Gene Roddenberry's original pitch for Star Trek {{as the title}} of a show with a different plot: the crew face several apparitions that are [...] "wish-fulfilment traps which become as real as flesh and blood"; the traps increase in subtlety until the crew struggle to differentiate between apparition and reality. Lee Erwin, who had previously worked on The Lieutenant with Roddenberry, was commissioned to produce a treatment; an outline featuring a salt-devouring vampire was handed in on April 8, 1966. Meanwhile, George Clayton Johnson had been assigned a storyline, tentatively titled [...] "Chicago II", in which the crew of the Enterprise visit a planet where the culture was that of 1920s mob-era Chicago. Johnson was hired after story editor John D. F. Black recommended him to the producers. Johnson decided to use the 1953 science fiction novel The Syndic by Cyril M. Kornbluth {{as the basis for the}} story. Roddenberry felt that Johnson's treatment did not match his vision for Star Trek, but did not want <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>him</b> entirely, and asked him to write [...] "The Man Trap". Erwin was paid in full for his version, and given a separate [...] "kill fee" [...] because it would not be used.|$|E
500|$|Lewis and Audrey {{decide to}} rekindle their {{relationship}} in March 2012.

When Lewis is wrongly accused of taking some money from The Bistro, he plans to leave Weatherfield. Nicholls told White that Audrey feels awful that she too accused Lewis {{and it is a}} wake up call for her as she does trust him. The actress said Audrey still fancies Lewis and does not want <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>him</b> again. Lewis and Audrey spend the night together and decide to keep their relationship a secret, especially from Audrey's family, as his [...] "past indiscretions still loom over them like a dark cloud". Nicholls said Audrey could be making a mistake, and added, [...] "You read this sort of thing in the papers all the time, women of a certain age being charmed by these men. I'd ask her to think about what she's doing." [...] A writer for Inside Soap said that Audrey and Lewis are very happy as they [...] "bask in the warmth of their revived romance." [...] However, they have to resort to sneaky measures to spend time together to avoid upsetting Audrey's family. When Audrey calls in sick at the salon to spend time with Lewis, Gail and David become concerned and check up on her. They see Lewis leaving her house and realise the pair are back together.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with SFX producer Phil Collinson stated that after the Doctor regenerates the [...] "initial dynamic changes because [...] has to learn to trust him again". Piper added that as the Doctor is incapacitated Rose consequently feels [...] "unloved", [...] "isolated" [...] and [...] "like she's lost her best friend". In the Doctor's absence Rose relies on her observations of him and tries to mimic his actions. Collinson {{felt it was important}} to resolve any mistrust between the pair {{by the end of the}} Christmas Special, as the public had responded well to Rose and the Doctor's friendship previously. Davies had scripted dialogue in [...] "The Christmas Invasion" [...] explaining the newly regenerated Doctor's estuary English accent by stating he had imprinted on Rose and adopted her way of speaking. However, due to time constraints this sequence was not filmed. Discussing how Rose had developed by the second series, Piper described her as having [...] "come on in leaps and bounds" [...] and stated she is now [...] "a lot more proactive." [...] She felt that there is a [...] "different kind of energy" [...] between Rose and the Tenth Doctor, whilst Tennant remarked that the audience would get to see the Doctor-companion relationship [...] "developing and becoming something that it maybe hasn't before." [...] Piper stated that with the Tenth Doctor, Rose is [...] "more tetchy and more possessive" [...] over him as [...] "she feels like she's lost him once and doesn't want <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>him</b> again". She cited Rose's [...] "catfight" [...] with former companion Sarah Jane Smith in [...] "School Reunion" [...] as evidence of this. Discussing the possibility of Rose and the Tenth Doctor becoming more romantically involved Piper stated [...] "You want it to happen, but at the same time you don't want it to happen". Tennant likened the dynamic between the pair to that of Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) in The X-Files. Both Tennant and Piper agreed that the expectation of the relationship is more exciting than having it realised. To add to the tragedy of their separation, Davies scripted the series two story arc so that Rose and the Doctor would be indirectly responsible for their separation. [...] "It's deliberate when that happens [...] ", said Davies, [...] "and they do pay the price. In [...] "Tooth and Claw", they set up the very thing— Torchwood— that separates them in the end. It's sort of their own fault." [...] Though Davies left the Doctor's response to Rose's declaration of love in [...] "Doomsday" [...] unstated, Gardner felt strongly that the character reciprocated her feelings. On the commentary for the episode she stated that she would [...] "confirm to the world" [...] that he was going to [...] "say it back." ...|$|E

Pacquiao, who has himself been known to be supportive of the Arroyo government, said that he was persuaded to run by local officials of General Santos City, who hoped he would act as a bridge between their interests and the national government. But after the Philippine Supreme Court declared null and void all nominations of the Liberal Party faction under Atienza, Pacquiao ran under the Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino (KAMPI), a pro-Arroyo political party.
