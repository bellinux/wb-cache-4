5|$|The Altair 8800 {{was modeled}} after early 1970s {{minicomputers}} {{such as the}} Data General Nova. These machines contained a CPU board, memory boards, and I/O boards; the data storage and display terminal were external devices. The Teletype Model 33 ASR was a popular terminal because it provided printed output and data storage on punched paper tape. More advanced systems would have 8-inch floppy disks and a video terminal that would display 24 lines of 80 characters such as the ADM-3A. (No graphics were available and lower-case letters were a $75 option.) Most of these computers had a front panel with <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> for entering data and lights for displaying it. These were normally used to boot the computer and to diagnose problems.|$|E
25|$|While which {{specific}} {{system is}} considered the first microcomputer {{is a matter of}} debate, as there were several unique hobbyist systems developed based on the Intel 4004 and its successor, the Intel 8008, the first commercially available microcomputer kit was the Intel 8080-based Altair 8800, which was announced in the January 1975 cover article of Popular Electronics. However, this was an extremely limited system in its initial stages, having only 256 bytes of DRAM in its initial package and no input-output except its <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> and LED register display. Despite this, it was initially surprisingly popular, with several hundred sales in the first year, and demand rapidly outstripped supply. Several early third-party vendors such as Cromemco and Processor Technology soon began supplying additional S-100 bus hardware for the Altair 8800.|$|E
500|$|To {{navigate}} the world, the player simply clicks {{in the direction}} they want to walk or turn. The mouse cursor changes in appearance, depending on its position {{on the screen and}} what it is hovering over, to show what effect clicking will have. [...] For instance, if the player positions the cursor hand near the side of the screen, it may show a pointing finger, indicating that clicking will turn the view in that direction. The cursor also changes in context to show when players can drag or <b>toggle</b> <b>switches,</b> or when certain items can be picked up and carried. Such items can then be examined at any time, and either reveal clues to puzzles or provide information on the game's setting and story. [...] Like Myst, Riven has an optional method of navigation known as Zip Mode, which allows players to skip to areas already explored, but may cause them to miss important clues.|$|E

500|$|The SIII {{is powered}} by Android, a Linux-based, open source mobile {{operating}} system developed by Google and introduced commercially in 2008. Among other features, the software allows users to maintain customized home screens which can contain shortcuts to applications and widgets for displaying information. Four shortcuts to frequently used applications can be stored on a dock {{at the bottom of}} the screen; the button in the center of the dock opens the application drawer, which displays a menu containing all of the apps installed on the device. A tray accessed by dragging from the top of the screen allows users to view notifications received from other apps, and contains <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> for commonly used functions. Pre-loaded apps also provide access to Google's various services. The SIII uses Samsung's proprietary TouchWiz graphical user interface (GUI). The [...] "Nature" [...] version used by the SIII has a more [...] "organic" [...] feel than previous versions, and contains more interactive elements such as a water ripple effect on the lock screen. To complement the TouchWiz interface, and as a response to Apple's Siri, the phone introduces S Voice, Samsung's intelligent personal assistant. S Voice can recognize eight languages including English, Korean, Italian and French. Based on Vlingo, S Voice enables the user to verbally control 20 functions such as playing a song, setting the alarm, or activating driving mode; it relies on Wolfram Alpha for online searches.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1919 and 1927, Mary Hallock-Greenewalt, a piano soloist, {{created a}} new {{technological}} art form called Nourathar, which means [...] "essence of light" [...] in Arabic. Her light music consisted of environmental color fields that produced a scale of light intensities and color. [...] "In place of a keyboard, the Sarabet had a console with graduated sliders and other controls, more like a modern mixing board. Lights could be adjusted directly via the sliders, {{through the use of}} a pedal, and with <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> that worked like individual keys." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Altair {{shipped in}} a two-piece case. The {{backplane}} and power supply were {{mounted on a}} base plate, along with {{the front and rear}} of the box. The [...] "lid" [...] was shaped like a C, forming the top, left and right sides of the box. The front panel, which was inspired by the Data General Nova minicomputer, included a large number of <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> to feed binary data directly into the memory of the machine, and a number of red LEDs to read those values back out.|$|E
50|$|Several {{modifications}} were made. A <b>toggle</b> <b>switch</b> {{mounted on}} the back of the amplifier chassis allows switching between tube (the original) and solid-state rectification; in the latter mode, output is boosted to 50 watts. A second <b>toggle</b> <b>switch</b> allows the player to disable the Normal channel and the Vibrato effect; the preamp gain is increased, and more distortion and sustain is available. This version of the amplifier has a fifteen-inch Eminence speaker and point-to-point wiring.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, a {{computer}} could execute only one {{program at a}} time. [...] Each user had sole use of the computer for a limited {{period of time and}} would arrive at a scheduled time with program and data on punched paper cards or punched tape. The program would be loaded into the machine, and the machine would be set to work until the program completed or crashed. Programs could generally be debugged via a front panel using <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> and panel lights. It is said that Alan Turing was a master of this on the early Manchester Mark 1 machine, and he was already deriving the primitive conception of an operating system from the principles of the universal Turing machine.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Gibson issued three Pete Townshend {{signature}} edition Les Paul Deluxe guitars, {{based on}} Townshend's heavily customised [...] "#1" [...] Wine Red 1976 Les Paul Deluxe, [...] "#3" [...] Gold top 1976, and [...] "#9" [...] Cherry Sunburst 1976. These guitars were modified by Alan Rogan and used extensively {{on stage and}} {{in the studio with}} The Who. In addition to the two mini-humbuckers the guitar carried, Rogan modified Townshend's originals with a DiMarzio humbucker in the middle. <b>Toggle</b> <b>switches</b> located behind the guitar's tailpiece turned the pickup on and off and added volume boost. The control knobs were wired for volume, one for each pickup and a master volume. The reissues differed from Townshend's originals in that the reissues had an inlay at the first fret while the originals did not.|$|E

40|$|Two {{synthetic}} gene circuits [...] the genetic <b>toggle</b> <b>switch</b> and the repressilator [...] are analyzed quantitatively and {{discussed in the}} context of an educational module on gene circuits and feedback that constitutes the final topic of a year-long introductory physics sequence, aimed at biology and premedical undergraduate students. The genetic <b>toggle</b> <b>switch</b> consists of two genes, each of whose protein product represses the other's expression, while the repressilator consists of three genes, each of whose protein product represses the next gene's expression. Analytic, numerical, and electronic treatments of the genetic <b>toggle</b> <b>switch</b> shows that this gene circuit realizes bistability. A simplified treatment of the repressilator reveals that this circuit can realize sustained oscillations. In both cases, a "phase diagram" is obtained, that specifies the region of parameter space in which bistability or oscillatory behavior, respectively, occurs...|$|R

40|$|The genetic bi-stable <b>switch</b> (<b>toggle</b> <b>switch)</b> {{consists}} of two genes which repress one another through their synthesised proteins. In the stochastic bi-stable case, the <b>toggle</b> <b>switch</b> exhibits noise induced flips. Using simulation based techniques, we identified three methods for reducing the random flipping probability, namely: (i) increasing the system size, (ii) increasing the synthesis rate, and (iii) increasing the Hill coefficient. Our heat-maps showed that for large parts of parameter space the <b>toggle</b> <b>switch</b> displays extremely low noise induced flipping probability, and consequently high robustness. We also analysed the noise analytically. The area of validity of the analytical approach {{was found to be}} constrained to low Hill coefficients and high synthesis rate (both conditions within biological realistic parameters). Most importantly, we observed that increasing the synthesis rate is more efficient in reducing the noise compared to the increase in system size, for systems affected by negative feedback. © 2010 Crown...|$|R
