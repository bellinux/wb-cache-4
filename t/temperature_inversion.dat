The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion)</b> towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.|$|E

The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures. The resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations, thereof. Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> present.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms {{can form}} dense cirrus at their tops. As the {{cumulonimbus}} cloud in a thunderstorm grows vertically, the liquid water droplets freeze {{when the air}} temperature reaches the freezing point. The anvil cloud takes its shape because the <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> at the tropopause prevents the warm, moist air forming the thunderstorm from rising any higher, thus creating the flat top. In the tropics, these thunderstorms occasionally produce copious amounts of cirrus from their anvils. High-altitude winds commonly push this dense mat out into an anvil shape that stretches downwind as much as several kilometers.|$|E

In the first part, the concept of the ABL is defined and main theoretical aspects of air stratification are explored. The main part of the background research summarizes current knowledge of <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions,</b> especially how the landscape pattern influences their development and parameters under different synoptic situations, and methods used for their detection, measurement and evaluation. Considering the theme of the thesis, main geographic factors influencing <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> in the area of Prague are also defined. The focus of actions is placed on inversions analysis based upon time series of Praha-Libuš rawinsonde station. Homogeneity of used data is tested and all inversions within the 2000 - meters-thick-layer close to the ground are derived. Diurnal, annual and interannual frequency variations are described. Significance of long-term trends is tested and trends are compared to data from Prostějov and Kümmersbruck stations.

The <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> are likely to occur in Sibiu area due to its position inside a depression of contact between the Southern Carpathians and the Transylvanian Plateau. The effects of these inversions involve not only very low temperatures but also a stable air stratification that does not allow convective air movements; that increases air pollution in the city. The aim of this research is to identify the level of air pollution in days with <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions.</b> There were analysed the daily medium concentrations of the following atmospheric pollutants: sulfur dioxide SO 2, nitrogen dioxide NO 2, carbon monoxide CO and ozone O 3, in days with or without inversions. The concentration of two of the above mentioned pollutants is maximum in days with general <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions,</b> high atmospheric pressure and slow wind speed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT] In the Nobi Plain, {{temperature}} profiles {{were measured}} in 41 observation wells in 1993 and 1994. There are many <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> in the vertical temperature profiles of recharge area. In the Nobi Plain, annual {{mean surface temperature}} increases about 2 ℃ during last 100 years, and {{it is assumed that}} this surface warming causes subsurface <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions.</b> A three-dimensional numerical model of heat transfer in the Nobi Plain is used to investigate the influence of surface temperature warming outside the discharge area, where inversions are evident in the measured temperature profiles. Simulated results show that subsurface <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> are formed in recharge area at depth between 50 m- 130 m below sea level, because subsurface temperature has been cooled with the advective heat transfer by the downward groundwater flow from the surface. On the other hand, shallow subsurface temperatures in the center part of the plain have been heated more by upward regional groundwater flow than by the effect of surface warming, so that <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> are not observed...|$|R

25|$|In certain weather {{conditions}} during the summer, prevailing westerly winds blow air pollution from vehicles and from ships in Vancouver harbour east up the triangular delta, trapping it between the Coast Mountains {{on the north}} and the Cascades on the southeast. Air quality suffers. This usually occurs during a <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion,</b> and lasts for a few days. Ground-level ozone tends to be from local sources in the valley and varies with prevailing winds. With prevailing winds from the northeast during the late fall and winter, air quality is seldom a problem.|$|E

Similar to other areas in northern Utah, during mid-winter high pressure systems often situate themselves over Cache Valley, leading to strong <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions.</b> These <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> trap cold air and pollutants and allow thick smog to accumulate in the valley about three percent of the time. This can result in the worst air-pollution levels in the U.S., reducing air quality to unhealthy level.|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the process}} to {{determine}} whether it is possible to retrieve boundary layer structure with the current sounding techniques, temperature retievals were performed for radiosonde profiles that showed <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions.</b> It was found that when <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> exceed 8 to 10 C a retrieval will indeed show a temperature increase with height over a limited vertical distance. For weaker <b>inversions</b> retrieved <b>temperatures</b> are generally smoothly decreasing with height. It is, however, impossible to determine the actual mixed layer height from the retrievals. Whether the water vapor channels could be used in observing mixed layer structure was investigated. <b>Temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> are accompanied by significant drops in relative humidity. While this effect is very pronounced in parts of the trade wind regimes with relative humidity drops of up to 60 %, it is widespread {{in other areas of the}} ocean as well.

25|$|Stoke-on-Trent, as {{with all}} of the United Kingdom, {{experiences}} a temperate maritime climate, lacking in weather extremes. The local area is relatively elevated due to its proximity to the Pennines, resulting in cooler temperatures year round compared to the nearby Cheshire Plain. However, on calm, clear nights this is often reversed as cold air drainage causes a <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> to occur. As such, the Stoke-on-Trent and Newcastle area are generally not susceptible to severe frosts. The nearest Met Office weather station is Keele University, about four miles west of the city centre.|$|E
25|$|The {{mountains}} also block {{most of the}} oceanic {{influence of}} the Atlantic, which creates a climate much more continental than nearby cities west or north of the mountains, like Limoges and Montluçon. Thus the city has comparatively cold winters and hot summers. From November to March, frost is very frequent, and the city, being {{at the bottom of}} a valley, is frequently subject to <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion,</b> in which the mountains are sunny and warm, and the plain is freezing cold and cloudy. Snow is quite common, although usually short-lived and light. Summer temperatures often exceed , with sometimes violent thunderstorms.|$|E
50|$|Significant mid-winter <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> {{often occur}} in the Salt Lake Valley. These inversions, which often last for days and weeks, are most {{pronounced}} in mid-winter, although milder inversions sometimes occur during other seasons. Winter <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> cause cold, foggy and hazy valley conditions, with sunny and somewhat warmer conditions prevailing in the surrounding mountains. <b>Temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> trap valley air pollutants, which often rise to unhealthy levels. Humidity is only high enough and temperatures cold enough for fog to occur during mid-winter, although haze and smog can be found year-round. Inversions occur when strong areas of high pressure remain parked over the Great Basin. It usually takes a cold front to force out or break down the high pressure. Consequently, inversions are rare in spring and fall, when the weather takes on a more progressive pattern, with frequent fronts moving through. Such recurring and persistent patterns of inversions follow a unique timescale of about 30 days, providing a means for long-range weather prediction. Such prediction of persistent inversion up to 30 days has been made operational.|$|R

The precipitation levels {{and the level of}} maritime moderation varies depending on location and elevation. Green areas as well as desert exist on the archipelago. Due to their location above the <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> layer, the high mountains of these islands are ideal for astronomical observation.

Water cannot reach Coropuna from the Pacific Ocean. Most precipitation (7090%) falls during summer (DecemberMarch). A sharp reduction in precipitation was found during the El Niño years of 19821983 and 1992. These events were also accompanied by lower cloud cover, higher temperatures, and lower wind speed, increasing the glacier surface loss. However, the El Niño of 19971998 was accompanied by high precipitation. Precipitation mostly originates from the Atlantic Ocean via the Amazon basin.

As evidenced by the Sajsi (25,00019,000 years ago), Tauca (18,00014,000 years ago), and Coipasa (13,00011,000 years ago) lake highstands, ice age humidity was much higher in the Altiplano.|$|E
500|$|Strong but {{vertically}} shallow high-pressure systems {{moving from}} higher latitudes to lower latitudes {{in the northern}} hemisphere are associated with continental arctic air masses. [...] The low, sharp <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> can lead to areas of persistent stratocumulus or stratus cloud, known in colloquial terms as anticyclonic gloom. The type of weather brought about by an anticyclone depends on its origin.

High pressures that build {{to the north and}} extend southwards will often bring clear weather. This is due to being cooled at the base (as opposed to warmed), which helps prevent clouds from forming.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 87 - 91). The work {{presented in}} this dissertation stems from the link that exists between meteorological conditions and the significant accumulation of air pollutants in large urban agglomerations. The research focuses on the Greater Cape Town Area (GCTA), where <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> lead to high air pollutant concentrations and episodes of air pollution. As local meteorological conditions are often manifestations of larger weather producing phenomena (e. g. anticyclones), the work presented studies the changes that may occur in the synoptic conditions associated with <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions,</b> which will consequently affect the rate of occurrence of air pollution episodes. After a brief introduction of the topic, background information on the relevant legislation and the actions taken towards an air pollution abatement strategy and a detailed literature review, {{the high levels of}} air pollution in the GCT A during winter and especially during the morning peak hour traffic and their link to <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> are studied in detail for the year 2002. The large scale circulation and its link to <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> are studied through the application of the Self-Organizing Maps technique using NCEP-DOE Reanalysis 2 data and making use of the findings for the year 2002. The synoptic states most associated with <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> are found to be the anticyclonic conditions caused by the South Atlantic High Pressure (SAHP) system and the west coast trough associated with berg winds bringing dry continental air towards the GCT A. The 2002 data also show that more air pollution episode days are associated with west coast troughs than with the SAHP system and the average strength of the <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> associated with west coast troughs is found to be approximately 50 % higher than that associated with the SAHP system. The Global Circulation Models (GCMs) ECHAM 5, CNRM-CM 3 and CSIRO-MK 3. 5 are used to study the potential changes in the future climate of the area under the IPCC A 2 emissions scenario. ECHAM 5 shows a small increase in the synoptic states associated with anticyclonic influence over the south western part of South Africa and CNRM-CM 3 shows a small increase in both the synoptic states associated with anticyclonic influence and those associated with a west coast trough. Both models show a small decrease in the synoptic states associated with cold fronts. CSIRO-MK 3. 5 was not found to adequately reflect the current climatology in the domain, making it difficult to distinguish between model bias and future climate trends...|$|R
