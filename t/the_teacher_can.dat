The {{hypothesis is that}} <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>can</b> manipulate student effort, and hence student achievement, by choosing the proper grading practices. The grading model is analogous to a labor supply model, where <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>can</b> set <b>the</b> marginal returns to achievement or determine the grade level that is independent of real achievement. The empirical analysis shows that grading differences in the lower secondary school in Norway are much like differences in non-labor income and, further, that students who are exposed to hard grading perform significantly better than other students. ...|$|R

Among such, there would {{generally}} be some, who would refuse to have any {{thing to do with}} the measure, just from a desire to thwart and impede the plans of the teacher. If so, it is best to take no notice of them.

60|$|This {{principle}} {{has been}} kept in view, the reader may perhaps think, too closely, {{in all the}} chapters of this volume; almost every point brought up, having been illustrated by anecdotes and narratives. I propose, however, devoting one chapter now, to presenting a number of miscellaneous cases, without any attempt to arrange them. Sometimes the case will be merely stated, the reader being left to draw the inference; at others, such remarks will be added as the case suggests. All will however be intended to answer some useful purpose, either to exhibit good or bad management and its consequences, or to bring to view some trait of human nature, as it exhibits itself in children, which it may be desirable {{for the teacher to}} know. Let it be understood, however, that these cases are not selected with reference to their being strange, or extraordinary. They are rather chosen because they are common, i. e. they, or cases similar, will be constantly occurring to the teacher, and reading such a chapter will be the best substitute for experience which <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>can</b> have. Some are descriptions of literary exercises or plans which the reader can adopt in classes, or with a whole school; others are cases of discipline,--good or bad management, which <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>can</b> imitate or avoid. The stories are from various sources, and are the results of the experience of several individuals.|$|E
60|$|In my own school, it {{required}} {{two or three}} weeks to exclude whispering and communication by signs. The period necessary to effect the revolution will be longer or shorter, according to the circumstances of the school, and the dexterity of the teacher; and, after all, the teacher must not hope entirely to exclude it. Approximation to excellence is all that we can expect; for unprincipled and deceiving characters will perhaps always be found, and no system whatever can prevent their existence. Proper treatment may indeed be the means of their reformation, but before this process has arrived at a successful result, others similar in character will have entered, so that <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>can</b> never expect perfection in the operation of any of his plans.|$|E

60|$|The reports then {{of those}} who {{remained}} standing, were called for; first, those who had whispered only once were requested to sit; then those who had whispered more than once, and less than five times, &c. &c., until at last all were down. In such a case, the pupils might, if thought expedient, again be requested to rise, {{for the purpose of}} asking some other questions, with reference to ascertaining whether they had spoken most in the former or latter part of the forenoon. The number who had spoken inadvertently, and the number who had done it by design, might be ascertained. These inquiries accustom the pupils to render honest and faithful accounts of themselves. They become, by such means, familiarized to the practice, and by means of it, <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>can,</b> many times, receive most important assistance.|$|E
60|$|These directions, if {{understood}} and obeyed, would divide the class evidently into two portions. Those standing, have their work done, and done correctly, and those sitting, have some excuse or error to be examined. A new lesson {{may now be}} assigned, and the first portion may be dismissed; which, in a well regulated school, will be two-thirds of the class. Their slates may be slightly examined, as they pass by the teacher, {{on their way to}} their seats, to see that all is fair; but it will be safe to take it for granted, that a result, in which a majority agree, will be right. Truth is consistent with itself, but error, in such a case, never is. This, <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>can,</b> at any time, show, by comparing the answers that are wrong; they will always be found, not only to differ from the correct result, but to contradict each other.|$|E
60|$|I {{trust the}} {{principle}} which I have been attempting to enforce, is fully before the reader's mind, namely, that moral and religious instruction in a school, {{being in a}} great degree extra-official, in its nature, must be carried no farther than <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>can</b> go with the common consent, either expressed or implied, {{of those who have}} founded, and who support his school. Of course, if those founders forbid it altogether, {{they have a right to}} do so, and the teacher must submit. The only question that can justly arise, is, whether, he will remain in such a situation, or seek employment, where a door of usefulness, here closed against him, will be opened. While he remains, he must honestly and fully submit to the wishes of those, in whose hands Providence has placed the ultimate responsibility of training up the children of his school. It is only for a partial and specific purpose, that they are placed under his care.|$|E

Responding to the policies, this paper aims to introduce Hot Potatoes, Blog, and Edmodo, as some alternative educational technology that <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>can</b> utilize to support their teaching practices, particularly in their English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classrooms. The paper addresses technological potentials of the technology for teaching and learning, such as for accessing information about the language, providing exposure to English, publishing learner work, interacting with other learners, managing, and organizing learning. The paper also explains possible challenges in utilizing the technology specifically in EFL teaching contexts. The discussions are supported with my reflective experience in utilizing the technology, related research findings, and literature. This paper provides insights into alternative educational technology that <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>can</b> use.

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>can</b> awaken in {{the hearts}} of his pupils, a {{personal}} attachment for him, by asking in various ways, their assistance in school, and then appearing honestly gratified with the assistance rendered. Boys and girls are delighted to have what powers and attainments they possess, brought out into action, especially where they can lead to useful results. They love to be of some consequence in the world, and will be especially gratified to be able to assist their teacher. Even if the studies of a turbulent boy are occasionally interrupted for half an hour, that he might help you arrange papers, or rule books, or cut the tops of quills, or distribute exercises, it will be time well spent. Get him to co-operate with you in any thing, and he will feel how much pleasanter it is to co-operate, than to thwart and oppose; and by judicious measures of this kind, almost any boy may be brought over to your side.|$|E
60|$|While, however, {{it is thus}} {{distinctly}} {{understood that}} the power of the teacher is supreme, that all the power rests in him, and that he alone is responsible for its exercise, there ought, to be a very free and continual delegation of power to the pupils. As much business as is possible, should be committed to them. They should be interested as much as possible in the affairs of the school, and led to take an active part in carrying them forward; though they should, all the time, distinctly understand, that it is only delegated power which they exercise, and that <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>can,</b> at any time, revoke what he has granted, and alter or annul at pleasure, any of their decisions. By this plan, we have the responsibility resting where it ought to rest, and yet the boys are trained to business, and led to take an active interest in the welfare of the school. Trust is reposed in them, which may be greater or less, as they are able to bear. All the good effects of reposing trust and confidence, and committing the management of important business to the pupils will be secured, without the dangers which would result from the entire surrender of the management of the institution into their hands.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{to provide}} a way, by which {{teachers}} and pupils may write, anonymously, for the school. This may be done by having a place of deposit for such articles as may be written, where any person may leave what he wishes to have read, nominating, by a memorandum, upon the article itself, the reader. If a proper feeling on the subject of good discipline, and the formation of good character, prevails in school, many articles, which will {{have a great deal of}} effect upon the pupils, will find their way through such an avenue, once opened. <b>The</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>can</b> himself often bring forward, in this way, his suggestions, with more effect than he otherwise could do. Such a plan is, in fact like the plan of a newspaper for an ordinary community, where sentiments and opinions stand on their own basis, and influence the community just in proportion to their intrinsic merits, unassisted by the authority of the writer's name, and unimpeded by any prejudice which may exist against him. In my own school, this practice has had a very powerful effect. I have, myself, often thus anonymously addressed my pupils, and I have derived great assistance from communications which many of the pupils have written. Sometimes we have had full discussions of proposed measures, and at others, criticisms of the management of the school, or of prevailing faults. Sometimes good humored satires, and sometimes simple descriptions. 'Tis true the practice is not steadily kept up. Often, for months together, there is not an article offered. Still the place of deposit remains, and, after a time, some striking communication is made, which awakens general attention, and calls out other pens, until the fifteen minutes, corresponding to the afternoon General Exercise, in the plan provided in a preceding chapter, (which is all which is allowed to be devoted to such purposes,) is not sufficient to read what is daily offered. Of course, in such a plan as this, the teacher must have the usual editorial powers, to comment upon what is written, or to alter or suppress it at pleasure.[A] ...|$|E

6000|$|Upon this {{foundation}} of a sound accent and a basic vocabulary must be built the general fabric of the language. For the most part this must {{be done in the}} school. At present in Great Britain a considerable proportion of schoolmasters and schoolmistresses--more particularly those in secondary and private schools--are too ill-educated to do this properly; there is excellent reason for supposing things are very little better in America; and, to begin with, it must be the care of every good New Republican to bring about a better state of things in this most lamentable profession. Until <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>can</b> read and write, in the fullest sense of these words, it is idle to expect him or her to teach the pupil to do these things. As matters are at present, the attempt is scarcely made. In the elementary and lower secondary schools ill-chosen reading-books are scampered through and abandoned all too soon in favour of more pretentious [...] "subjects," [...] and a certain preposterous nonsense called English Grammar is passed through the pupil--stuff which happily no mind can retain. Little girls and boys of twelve or thirteen, who cannot understand, and never will understand anything but the vulgarest English, and who will never in their lives achieve a properly punctuated letter, are taught such mysteries as that there are eight--I believe it is eight--sorts of nominative, and that there is (or is not) a gerundive in English, and trained month after month and year after year to perform the oddest operations, a non- analytical analysis, and a ritual called parsing that must be seen to be believed. It is no good mincing the truth about all this sort of thing. These devices are resorted to by the school teachers of the present just as the Rules of Double and Single Alligation and Double Rule of Three, {{and all the rest of}} that solemn tomfoolery, were [...] "taught" [...] by the arithmetic teachers in the academies of the eighteenth century, because they are utterly ignorant, and know themselves to be utterly ignorant, of the reality of the subject, and because, therefore, they have to humbug the parent and pass the time by unreal inventions. The case is not a bit better in the higher grade schools. They do not do so much of the bogus teaching of English, but they do nothing whatever in its place.|$|E
