25|$|Edwards {{syndrome}} is a chromosomal abnormality {{characterized by the}} presence of an extra copy of genetic material on the 18th chromosome, either in whole (<b>trisomy</b> <b>18)</b> or in part (such as due to translocations). The additional chromosome usually occurs before conception. The effects of the extra copy vary greatly, depending on the extent of the extra copy, genetic history, and chance. Edwards syndrome occurs in all human populations, but is more prevalent in female offspring.|$|E
25|$|Human trisomies {{compatible}} with live birth, other than Down syndrome (trisomy 21), are Edwards syndrome (<b>trisomy</b> <b>18)</b> and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13).

The cf-DNA analysis was conducted after women received genetic counseling in a specialty laboratory. The results were validated by amniocentesis. A total of 1992 women were screened using cf-DNA analysis. The participants were 1631 Non Arabs (Fars, Kurd, and Lor) and 361 Arabs. The fetus risk for trisomy 21 in the Arab women of Arab race was two as much as Non Arab race, but <b>trisomies</b> <b>18</b> and 13 in women of Non Arab race were more than Arab race.

25|$|Aneuploidy, {{which refers}} to {{abnormal}} number of chromosomes, can also be detected using non-invasive prenatal tests. Research previous shown an increase in quantity of cffDNA in maternal plasma for fetal trisomy 13 and trisomy 21, {{and it is not}} elevated in fetal <b>trisomy</b> <b>18.</b> A number of fetal nucleic acid molecules derived from aneuploid chromosomes can be detected including SERPINEB2 mRNA, clad B, hypomethylated SERPINB5 from chromosome 18, placenta-specific 4 (PLAC4), hypermethylated holocarboxylase synthetase (HLCS) and c21orf105 mRNA from chromosome 12. With complete trisomy, the mRNA alleles in maternal plasma isn't the normal 1:1 ratio, but is in fact 2:1. Allelic ratios determined by epigenetic markers {{can also be used to}} detect the complete trisomies. Massive parallel sequencing and digital PCR for fetal aneuploidy detection can be used without restriction to fetal-specific nucleic acid molecules. Several cell-free fetal DNA and RNA technologies are under development to test a pregnancy for aneuploidy, mostly focusing on Down syndrome testing. Sampling of cffDNA from maternal blood for analysis by massively parallel sequencing (MPSS) is estimated to have a sensitivity of between 96 and 100%, and a specificity between 94 and 100% for detecting Down syndrome. It can be performed at 10 weeks of gestational age. One study in the United States estimated a false positive rate of 0.3% and a positive predictive value of 80% when using cffDNA to detect Down syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Prenatal diagnosis: Used {{to detect}} {{changes in a}} fetus's genes or {{chromosomes}} before birth. This type of testing is offered to couples with {{an increased risk of}} having a baby with a genetic or chromosomal disorder. In some cases, prenatal testing can lessen a couple's uncertainty or help them decide whether to abort the pregnancy. It cannot identify all possible inherited disorders and birth defects, however. One method of performing a prenatal genetic test involves an amniocentesis, which removes a sample of fluid from the mother’s amniotic sac 15 to 20 or more weeks into pregnancy. The fluid is then tested for chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) and <b>Trisomy</b> <b>18,</b> which can result in neonatal or fetal death. Test results can be retrieved within 7–14 days after the test is done. This method is 99.4% accurate at detecting and diagnosing fetal chromosome abnormalities. Although there is a risk of miscarriage associated with an amniocentesis, the miscarriage rate is only 1/400. Another method of prenatal testing is Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS). Chorionic villi are projections from the placenta that carry the same genetic makeup as the baby. During this method of prenatal testing, a sample of chorionic villi is removed from the placenta to be tested. This test is performed 10–13 weeks into pregnancy and results are ready 7–14 days after the test was done. Another test using blood taken from the fetal umbilical cord is percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling.|$|E

Chorionic villus sampling utilizes placental tissue to give information about fetal chromosome status and has been used since the 1970s. In addition to CVS, amniocentesis {{can be used to}} obtain fetal karyotype by examining fetal cells in amniotic fluid. It was first performed in 1952 and became standard practice in the 1970s.

2500|$|Most embryos cannot survive with {{a missing}} or extra {{autosome}} (numbered chromosome) and are spontaneously aborted. The most frequent aneuploidy in humans is trisomy 16, although fetuses affected {{with the full}} version of this chromosome abnormality do not survive to term (it is possible for surviving individuals to have the mosaic form, where trisomy 16 exists in some cells but not all). [...] The most common aneuploidy that infants can survive with is trisomy 21, which is found in Down syndrome, affecting 1 in 800 births. <b>Trisomy</b> <b>18</b> (Edwards syndrome) affects 1 in 6,000 births, and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) affects 1 in 10,000 births. 10% of infants with <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> or 13 reach 1 year of age.|$|E

Of course later on, we had used our technology to prove that she has a chromosome problem: <b>Trisomy</b> <b>18.</b> That means that this baby [...] going to have a developmental problem and is going to probably cease to exist right after the birth." [...] Dr. Diana Bianchi of Tufts disputes the possibility of the test being used for such a diagnosis. She says, [...] "The test involves looking at genetic sequences on the X chromosome and the Y chromosome. If he gave a diagnosis of <b>Trisomy</b> <b>18,</b> that involves a different chromosome, Chromosome 18. That is certainly something that is not advertised in the packaging associated with the test. [...] "It is possible that, upon being told of a problem by Acu-Gen, a woman may seek to have an amniocentesis or other invasive procedure which may be an unnecessary risk if the Acu-Gen diagnosis was in error.

This latter portion, in turn, arose from the pulmonary capillary plexus that envelops the lung bud. Pu and colleagues hypothesized that if the left postbranchial vessels cannot connect to the left sixth branchial arch, then they might capture a vascular supply from the most nearby major artery. When such a connection is made to the right sixth branchial arch through the embryonic peritracheal mesenchyme between the trachea and the esophagus, a PAS results (Pu et al. 1996).|$|R

STUDY DESIGN: The study includes plasma samples collected from patients with high-risk pregnancies in our CLIA-licensed, CAP-accredited laboratory between August 2012 to June 2013. Samples were assessed for <b>trisomies</b> 13, <b>18,</b> 21 and for the presence of chromosome Y-specific DNA. Sample data and ad hoc outcome information provided by the clinician was compiled and reviewed to determine the characteristics of this patient population, as well as estimate the assay performance in a clinical setting. RESULTS: NIPT patients most commonly undergo testing at an average of 15 weeks, 3 days gestation; and average 35. 1 years of age. The average turnaround time is 4. 54 business days and an overall 1. 3 % not reportable rate. The positivity rate for Trisomy 21 was 1. 51 %, followed by 0. 45 % and 0. 21 % rate for <b>Trisomies</b> <b>18</b> and 13, respectively. NIPT positivity rates are similar to previous large clinical studies of aneuploidy in women of maternal age ≥ 35 undergoing amniocentesis. In this population 3519 patients had multifetal gestations (3. 5 %) with 2. 61 % yielding a positive NIPT result. CONCLUSION: NIPT has been commercially offered for just over 2 years and the clinical use by patients and clinicians has increased significantly. The risks associated with invasive testing have been substantially reduced by providing another assessment of aneuploidy status in high-risk patients. The accuracy and NIPT assay positivity rate are as predicted by clinical validations and the test demonstrates improvement in the current standard of care...|$|R
