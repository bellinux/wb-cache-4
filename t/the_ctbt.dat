5000|$|The PTBT {{had mixed}} results. On the one hand, {{enactment}} of the treaty {{was followed by a}} substantial drop in the atmospheric concentration of radioactive particles. On the other hand, nuclear proliferation was not halted entirely (though it may have been slowed) and nuclear testing continued at a rapid clip. Compared to the 499 tests from 1945 to the signing of the PTBT, 436 tests were conducted over the ten years following the PTBT. Furthermore, US and Soviet underground testing continued [...] "venting" [...] radioactive gas into the atmosphere. Additionally, though underground testing was generally safer than above-ground testing, underground tests continued to risk the leaking of radionuclides, including plutonium, into the ground. From 1964 through 1996, the year of <b>the</b> <b>CTBT's</b> adoption, an estimated 1,377 underground nuclear tests were conducted.

40|$|Abstract. Monitoring {{the levels}} of {{radioxenon}} isotopes in the atmosphere has been proposed {{as a means of}} verifying the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). This translates into a classification problem, whereby the measured concentrations either belong to an explosion class or a background class. Instances drawn from the explosions class are extremely rare, if not non-existent. Therefore, the resulting dataset is extremely imbalanced, and inherently suited for one-class classification. Further exacerbating the problem {{is the fact that the}} background distribution can be extremely complex, and thus, modelling it using one-class learning is difficult. In order to improve upon the previous classification results, we investigate the augmentation of one-class learning methods with clustering. The purpose of clustering is to convert a complex distribution into simpler distributions, the clusters, over which more effective models can be built. The resulting model, built from oneclass learners trained over the clusters, performs more effectively than a model that is built over the original distribution. This thesis is empirically tested on three different data domains; in particular, a number of artificial datasets, datasets from the UCI repository, and data modelled after <b>the</b> extremely challenging <b>CTBT.</b> <b>The</b> results offer credence to the fact that there is an improvement in performance when clustering is used with one-class classification on complex distributions. ...|$|R

2500|$|After <b>the</b> <b>CTBT</b> {{entered into}} force in 1963, the FOA was {{assigned}} to build a seismographic complex to monitor the compliance with the treaty. The Swedish negotiators were quiet {{on the question of}} non-proliferation for years, particularly in [...] view of the Swedish freedom of action doctrine. Until 1965, there was an official directive to not raise the issue. The situation changed in early 1966. In March 1966, Undersecretary of the Defense Department Karl Frithiofson in his speech before the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences publicly announced that it was of no interest to Sweden to acquire nuclear weapons, which was a slight difference from the Freedom of action doctrine.|$|E
2500|$|However, India has {{not signed}} <b>the</b> <b>CTBT,</b> or the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, {{claiming}} the discriminatory {{nature of the}} treaty that allows the five declared nuclear {{countries of the world}} to keep their nuclear arsenal and develop it using computer simulation testing. Prior to its nuclear testing, India had pressed for a comprehensive destruction of nuclear weapons by all countries of the world in a time-bound frame. This was not favoured by the United States and by certain other countries. Presently, India has declared its policy of [...] "no-first use of nuclear weapons" [...] and the maintenance of a [...] "credible nuclear deterrence". The USA, under President George W. Bush has also lifted most of its sanctions on India and has resumed military co-operation.

40|$|Monitoring of {{radioactive}} noble gases, in particular xenon isotopes, {{is a crucial}} element of the verification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (<b>CTBT).</b> <b>The</b> capability of the noble gas network, which is currently under construction, to detect signals from a nuclear explosion critically depends on the background created by other sources. Therefore, the global distribution of these isotopes based on emissions and transport patterns needs to be understood. A significant xenon background exists in the reactor regions of North America, Europe and Asia. An emission inventory of the four relevant xenon isotopes has recently been created, which specifies source terms for each power plant. As the major emitters of xenon isotopes worldwide, a few medical radioisotope production facilities have been recently identified, in particular the facilities in Chalk River (Canada), Fleurus (Belgium), Pelindaba (South Africa) and Petten (Netherlands). Emissions from these sites are expected to exceed {{those of the other}} sources by orders of magnitude. In this study, emphasis is put on Xe- 133, which is the most prevalent xenon isotope. First, based on the emissions known, the resulting Xe- 133 concentration levels at all noble gas stations of <b>the</b> final <b>CTBT</b> verification network were calculated and found to be consistent with observations. Second, it turned out that emissions from the radioisotope facilities can explain a number of observed peaks, meaning that atmospheric transport modelling is an important tool for the categorization of measurements. Third, it became evident that Nuclear Power Plant emissions are more difficult to treat in the models, since their temporal variation is high and not generally reported. Fourth, there are indications that the assumed annual emissions may be underestimated by factors of two to ten, while the general emission patterns seem to be well understood. Finally, it became evident that Xe- 133 sources mainly influence the sensitivity of the monitoring system in the mid-latitudes, where the network coverage is particularly good...|$|R

40|$|Cast {{blasting}} operations associated with near surface coal recovery provide relatively large explosive sources that generate regional seismograms {{of interest in}} monitoring a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). This paper describes preliminary results {{of a series of}} experiments currently being conducted at the Black Thunder Coal Mine in northeast Wyoming as part of <b>the</b> DOE <b>CTBT</b> Research and Development Program. These experiments are intended to provide an integrated set of near-source and regional seismic data for the purposes of quantifying the coupling and source characterization of the explosions. The focus of this paper is on the types of data being recovered with some preliminary implications. The Black Thunder experiments are designed to assess three major questions: (1) how many mining explosions produce seismograms at regional distances {{that will have to be}} detected, located and ultimately identified by the National Data Center and what are the waveform characteristics of these particular mining explosions; (2) can discrimination techniques based on empirical studies be placed on a firm physical basis so that they can be applied to other regions where there is little monitoring experience; (3) can large scale chemical explosions (possibly mining explosions) be used to calibrate source and propagation path effects to regional stations, can source depth of burial and decoupling effects be studied in such a controlled environment? With these key questions in mind and given the cooperation of the Black Thunder Mine, a suite of experiments have been and are currently being conducted. This paper will describe the experiments and their relevance to CTBT issues...|$|R

40|$|ReVelle (1995) has {{recently}} presented {{a summary of}} available infrasonic signals from near earth objects (NEO`s) that entered the earth`s atmosphere between 1960 - 1980. We will analyze these signals using a formalism developed by Cox (1958) to calculate the energy of explosive sources in the atmosphere. For each source we will calculate the acoustic conversion efficiency for each source, i. e., the fraction of the original source energy that is available to couple into an acoustic wave. Based on results in Cox with conventional explosions, this quantity is expected to depend weakly on the range from the source. Since this quantity is difficult to estimate using fundamental blast wave theories, we instead use well-known, and independently calibrated, semi-empirical source energy-wave period (at maximum amplitude) scaling relations developed in the 1960 - 1975 period by the U. S. Air Force to determine the source energy, E{sub s}, from observations. Using E{sub s} and range to the source along with various observed signal and atmospheric properties, the efficiency can be computed, similar calculations have been done for other relevant atmospheric phenomena for low altitude sources. For example, thunder observations at relatively close range {{have been used by}} Few and co-workers to determine an acoustic conversion efficiency of about 0. 4 %. The only previous estimation for meteors was made by Astapovich (1946) who determined the acoustic efficiency to be less than 0. 01 %.
