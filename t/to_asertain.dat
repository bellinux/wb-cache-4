40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with changes of microcrystalline parameters in NB 4 D 2 (Bombyx mort) silk fibres, due to electron irradiation. The irradiation process was performed in air at room temperature using 8 MeV electron beam at different dose rates: 0, 25, 50 and 75 kGy, respectively. X-ray recording of these irradiated samples and the line profile analysis were carried out. The crystal imperfection parameters such as crystallite size, lattice strain (g in %) and surface weighted crystallite size (D-s) were computed and compared with other physical parameters in order <b>to</b> <b>asertain</b> {{the changes that have}} crept into these irradiated fibres. Exponential, lognormal and Reinhold functions for the column length distributions have been used for the determination of these parameters...|$|E
40|$|Author abstract]The {{purpose of}} the stady was <b>to</b> <b>asertain</b> whether ionic {{strength}} other than phosphate and ammonium ion represents the different condition on the phosphate and ammonium adsorption coefficient (P_ 2 O_ 5 or NH_ 4 -N mg/lOOg soil) or not with some typical soils. At the same time, causal connection between both adsorptive coefficient and phosphate or ammonium ion solubilities in bulk solution was discussed. The results are summarized as follows: 1) The effect of coexistence of other ions except for phosphate and ammonium in soil solution on phosphate adsorptive coefficient generally indicated the high value coefficient. Conversely, for the nitrogen coefficient, the value were reduced. 2) Both component adsorptive coefficient to the same soil were different from a little with consist of ionic species except for phosphate and ammonium ion. In this experiment condition, the ionic strength in the bulk solution did not always followed that same relation were formed to the coefficient. 3) Increase of the coexistence of salt in soil solution resulted the high activity of hydronium and ammonium ion, conversely, low activity of phosphate ions. 4) It seemed that phosphate adsorption by soil particle in this condition affect each phosphoric acid potential in the bulk solution, ammonium adsorption also dominated each ammonium potential in the bulk solution. [著者抄録]土壌のリン酸およびアンモニウム吸収係数測定時に共存する他イオンの存在でどのような影響がそれらの養分吸収係数に現われるかを明らかにしようとして本実験を行なった。また、土壌に吸着された成分の特異性がそれらのイオンの溶存性に現われる際に、養分吸収係数との関連で若干の考察を行ない、次の諸点を明らかにした。 1. 土壌中の共存塩類がリン酸の吸収係数におよぼす効果は土壌の種類により強弱の差があるがいずれも増加の傾向を示し、また窒素に対しては逆に係数減少の傾向を示す結果を得た。 2. 主要吸収成分以外のイオン種の構成の違いで養分吸収係数は多少異なり、イオン強度は必ずしもこのような実験条件下においては両係数に対して一致した関係を示さない。 3. 共存塩類の増加は外液のヒドロニウムイオンの活量増加をもたらし、同時にリン酸イオンの活量の減少とアンモニウムイオンの活量増加をもたらした。 4. 本条件によるリン酸の土壌吸着はpH+pH_ 2 PO_ 4 の値に規制されるそれぞれのイオンの溶存性によって支配される傾向を示した。またアンモニウムの吸着は溶存する各イオンの比のpH-pNH_ 4 の値にかなり左右された...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} {{number of years}} there has been a move towards using ICT. This study explores factors that affect post-primary {{teachers}} use of ICT in the teaching and learning environment. The researcher used a case study approach to investigate ICT use in a recently established community school in Ireland. A self-administered questionnaire was issued to all teaching staff (n= 70). A random sample of teachers (n= 7) were interviewed on their ICT practices and attitudes towards using ICT. School management were also interviewed <b>to</b> <b>asertain</b> their views on ICT use within the case study school. The results recorded show that there is a high level of ICT use in the case study school. Factors identified as affecting teachers use of ICT in the teaching and learning environment were identified. The following factors were found to affect ICT use in the case study school - positive attitudes towards using ICT, level of ICT training and support, lack of time, lack of a detailed ICT policy, both teachers and managements’ attitude towards using ICT, easy access and availalbility of ICT hardware and software and the teaching group. The study did not identify teacher pedagogy, age and gender as significant factors affecting teachers’ ICT use in the case study school. The paper concludes by noting that while there may be significant benefits and potential in the use of ICT in the teaching and learning environment {{it is important to understand}} the factors that affect teachers’ willingness to embrace and use this technology. If educators are aware of the factors affecting ICT use it allows both teachers and management to continue to progress and develop their ICT use in the teaching and learning environment...|$|E
