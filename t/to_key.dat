5000|$|Brownies are 7 and 8-year-old girls. Brownies aim {{to develop}} a sense of {{identity}} and a positive relationship with others by participating in a varied program of activities. Their uniforms used to be brown, then changed to orange and navy blue, and are now the uniform blue T-shirt with brown insets at the collar and sleeves. The Brownie program book is called [...] "Brownies Can Do It!", and is divided into ten [...] "keys".

5|$|Assigned to the Eastern Gulf Blockading Squadron under Rear Admiral Theodorus Bailey, De Soto spent March and April fruitlessly {{cruising}} for CSS Alabama in the Gulf of Mexico. As {{one of the}} few fast steamers in Bailey's command, De Soto {{possessed a}} speed advantage over most of her blockade running prey. This was demonstrated on 24 April, when De Soto sailors boarded and seized two sloops, Jane Adelie and Bright, sixteen hours out of Mobile, Alabama, and each laden with cotton. Two schooners, General Prim and Rapid, were then taken the very next day, and they too carried cotton. All four prizes were sent <b>to</b> <b>Key</b> West for adjudication. On 27 April, De Soto continued the run of good luck, seizing the British schooner Clarita en route from Havana, Cuba to Matamoras.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Spanish–American War in April 1898, Indiana was at Key West {{with the rest of the}} North Atlantic Squadron, at the time commanded by Rear Admiral William T. Sampson. His squadron was ordered to the Spanish port of San Juan in an attempt to intercept and destroy Admiral Cervera's Spanish squadron, which was en route to the Caribbean from Spain. The harbor was empty, but Indiana and the rest of the squadron bombarded it for two hours on 12 May 1898 before realizing their mistake. The squadron returned <b>to</b> <b>Key</b> West, where news arrived three weeks later that Commodore Schley's Flying Squadron had found Cervera and was now blockading him in the port of Santiago de Cuba. Sampson reinforced Schley on 1 June and assumed overall command.|$|E
5|$|Australia had injury {{concerns}} <b>to</b> <b>key</b> players {{ahead of}} the tour. Chronic knee injuries had begun to hamper medium-pacer Toshack, and he only made the trip after a 3–2 vote by a medical panel, despite {{being one of the}} first players chosen by the selectors on cricketing merit. Leading paceman Lindwall had been playing with an injured leg tendon. In addition, his foot drag during the delivery stride led to speculation about the legality of his bowling action. The injury was worked on {{ahead of the}} tour, while Bradman advised Lindwall on how to rectify any suspicion over his bowling action. The Australian captain advised his bowler to ensure that his foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to operate below full speed until the umpires were satisfied. Bradman's counsel was effective, as Lindwall did not have a no-ball problem during the tour.|$|E
5|$|Calgary {{ended the}} {{exhibition}} season with several injuries <b>to</b> <b>key</b> players.

As {{a result of the}} injuries, the Flames signed centre Brendan Morrison to a contract; Morrison had been in training camp with the Canucks before being released. Rookie defenceman T. J. Brodie proved the surprise player of training camp. Expected to start the year with the Abbotsford Heat of the American Hockey League (AHL), Brodie impressed the Flames' coaching staff and earned a position on the team to begin the NHL season.|$|E

Davis and Jerome Williams were traded early in the season for Jalen Rose and Donyell Marshall. After 50 games, Toronto was 25–25 and in a position to make the playoffs, but injuries <b>to</b> <b>key</b> players sent the Raptors plummeting down the standings. Rose, Carter and Alvin Williams all suffered injuries as the Raptors struggled to a record of 8–24 in their remaining games. The notable individual season performances were Carter's 22.5 ppg, Marshall's 10.7 rpg, and rookie Bosh, a 6–10 forward-centre, averaging 11.5ppg and 7.4rpg and being named to the NBA All-Rookie Team.

5|$|Despite the {{disbanding}} of the camps, {{the defeated}} {{forces of the}} former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign into Rwanda from North Kivu. The insurgents maintained a presence in Rwanda's north western provinces and were supported by the predominantly Hutu population, {{many of whom had}} lived in the refugee camps before they were attacked. In addition to supporting the wars in the Congo, Kagame began a propaganda campaign to bring the Hutu to his side. He integrated former soldiers of the deposed genocidal regime's military into the RPF-dominated national army and appointed senior Hutu <b>to</b> <b>key</b> local government positions in the areas hit by insurgency. These tactics were eventually successful; by 1999, the population in the north west had stopped supporting the insurgency and the insurgents were mostly defeated.|$|E
