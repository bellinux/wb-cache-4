5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hastily planned {{commando}} operations {{undertaken in}} June and July 1940, {{there was a}} period of inactivity in which the concept was refined and detailed planning was undertaken while individual units carried out extensive and specialised training. In early 1941 a number of raids were undertaken but No. 6 Commando did not conduct its first operation until later in the year.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the revolt}} was also fuelled by a general feeling of discontent and humiliation at <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Angeloi, {{especially}} {{in terms of}} foreign policy. This much is evident from the— albeit embellished— account of the eyewitness Nicholas Mesarites, whereby John Komnenos's supporters proclaimed that henceforth everything would go well for Romania, that her enemies would be vanquished, and that the kings of all the earth would come to pay homage to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ratings agencies, European {{regulators}} obtained {{new powers}} to supervise ratings agencies. With {{the creation of}} the European Supervisory Authority in January 2011 the EU set up a whole range of new financial regulatory institutions, including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which became the EU's single credit-ratings firm regulator. Credit-ratings companies have to comply with the new standards or will be denied operation on EU territory, says ESMA Chief Steven Maijoor.|$|E

5|$|Hundreds of {{emergency}} personnel {{responded to the}} crash site and helped save victims. Many of those who survived were severely injured and required months or years to physically recover. NTSB investigators looked at various factors {{that contributed to the}} crash. <b>The</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flight crew were cited as the probable cause of the crash, but the weather, air traffic controller performances, and FAA traffic management were also cited as contributing to the events that led to the accident. This conclusion was controversial, with disagreement between investigators, passengers, and Avianca as to who was ultimately responsible. Eventually, the U.S. government joined with Avianca and settled to pay for the damages to the victims and their families. The crash was also portrayed in a variety of media.|$|E

25|$|The massive {{famine in}} the early 1930s (which was {{organized}} partly by the state) was blamed on religious believers who supposedly were infiltrating the collective farms and wrecking them from within. They were blamed in similar ways for <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet economy in the 1930s. Religious festivals were also blamed for hurting the economy by introducing high work absenteeism and drunkenness.|$|E

25|$|The law of equipartition {{breaks down}} when the thermal energy kBT is {{significantly}} smaller than the spacing between energy levels. Equipartition no longer holds {{because it is a}} poor approximation to assume that the energy levels form a smooth continuum, which is required in the derivations of the equipartition theorem above. Historically, <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classical equipartition theorem to explain specific heats and blackbody radiation were critical in showing the need for a new theory of matter and radiation, namely, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.|$|E
25|$|While Mao's {{personal}} motivations {{were certainly}} pivotal to the Cultural Revolution, they reasoned that {{a multitude of}} other complex factors contributed to the way events unfolded. These include China's relationship with the global Communist movement, geopolitical concerns, the ideological rift between China and the Soviet Union, Khrushchev's ouster, and <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Leap Forward. The movement was, at least in part, a legacy project to cement Mao's place in history, aimed to boost his prestige while he was alive and preserve the invulnerability of his ideas after his death.|$|E

According to Norman Davies, <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sanation regime (combined with the objective economic realities) caused a radicalization of the Polish masses {{by the end of}} the 1930s, but he warns against drawing parallels with the incomparably more destructive precedents of Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union under Stalin.|$|E

However, many of these measures were opposed by the conservatives of the Qing Court, and many reformers were either imprisoned or executed outright. <b>The</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Imperial Court to enact such political liberalization and modernization caused the reformists to take the road of revolution.|$|E
