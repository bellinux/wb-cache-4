During the day, the males backed into the tadpole-filled water of the tree holes and remained in that half-submerged state until night. During this time, the tadpoles swam around them, rasping small pieces of skin from their fathers' backs and eating them. This was the first observed instance of any frog species doing this, though it was similar to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>some</b> female caecilians feed their young.|$|E

500|$|Pain {{control is}} another means to {{facilitate}} the elimination of secretions. A chest wall injury can make coughing painful, increasing the likelihood that secretions will accumulate in the airways. [...] Chest injuries also contribute to hypoventilation (inadequate breathing) because the chest wall movement involved in breathing adequately is painful. Insufficient expansion of the chest may lead to atelectasis, further reducing oxygenation of the blood. Analgesics (pain medications) can be given to reduce pain. Injection of anesthetics into nerves in the chest wall, called nerve blockade, is another approach to pain management; this does not depress respiration <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>some</b> pain medications can.|$|E

He also felt that Amanda Tapping was convincing as a British scientist. In conclusion, Blackwell stated [...] "Sanctuary does {{take a while to}} kick in, but it is a very good series once the writers actually write something with depth." [...] Alex Walker of Den of Geek rated the first season three stars out of five, stating [...] "the acting and scripting is good, but Sanctuary lacks the wit and charm of the genre's top shows like Doctor Who and Battlestar Galactica. Also, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>some</b> episodes alternate between fighting and exposition gives the impression of watching someone else play a videogame." [...] Walker also dubbed it a [...] "poor man's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, but said that it [...] "makes for [...] "agreeable early-evening viewing".

500|$|The [...] "time-travel-around-the-world" [...] {{theme of}} Crash Bandicoot: Warped allowed the Naughty Dog artists to stretch {{beyond the limits}} imposed by the island-themed setting of the {{previous}} games; each time theme has distinctly unique structures and color palettes. To demonstrate the effect that color has on the mood of an environment, level sketches, {{such as those of}} the Arabian or medieval levels, were recolored to alter the depicted time of day from day to night. Naughty Dog aimed to visually distinguish Crash Bandicoot: Warped from previous installments by [...] "opening up the environment" [...] and allowing greater distances to be visible without draw-in or fog; to achieve the image of endless rolling hills and distant castles seen in the Medieval levels, level of detail was accounted for by introducing new technologies into the game engine and changing <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>some</b> of the background elements were constructed. The most detailed textures of Crash Bandicoot: Warped are located in the Egyptian Tomb levels in the form of decorative paintings. To keep the image of an endless highway in the motorcycle levels from being boring, roadside details such as cacti and telephone poles were added to the scenery. Additionally, distant mesas were added to help break up the horizon. To give the desert highway some character, full-service gas stations and diners were added to the roadside to evoke a [...] "1950s America" [...] flavor. The Great Wall of China is portrayed during its construction stage to add visual variety and provide gameplay obstacles. Initial ideas for the submerged Atlantis stage varied from an ancient Roman-esque city in ruins to a high-tech submerged city of alien origin.|$|E

500|$|During May 1921, Chapman met Gertrude ("Beet" [...] or [...] "Beety") Lowry, {{the sister}} of Tom Lowry, a cricketer from New Zealand who played for Cambridge and Somerset {{and went on to}} captain his country. The couple met again when Chapman toured New Zealand in 1922–23, and became engaged. At the end of the 1924–25 Australia tour, they married and {{returned}} to England together. The wedding was widely reported and {{until the end of the}} decade the couple were heavily involved in social events. They were popular guests at functions, and became notable figures in the fashionable society of the upper classes. In 1923, Chapman joined a Kent brewery, Mackeson, then owned by H & G Simonds. The brewery was later sold to the Kent brewer Jude, Hanbury & Co which became part of Whitbread. [...] His wife believed that his choice of a career working in the alcohol trade made his life difficult and contributed to his heavy drinking. The social duties associated with his job also contributed to his increased weight and failing fitness in the later part of his cricket career. Further problems arose through his fame; as he wanted to keep people happy, he drank frequently and attended many social functions. Cricket writer Ivo Tennant believes that Chapman's [...] "taste for conviviality was his undoing". He always appeared happy, but Gibson observes [...] "that is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>some</b> men disguise their unhappiness", and Lemmon suggests that Chapman was seeking acceptance and felt lonely at heart. According to Lemmon, by the end of the Second World War, Chapman was largely living in the past, and that [...] "mentally he was still in the happy days of University cricket." ...|$|E
