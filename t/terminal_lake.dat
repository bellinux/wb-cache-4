40|$|Spectral {{characteristics}} of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) {{were examined in}} conjunction with environmental factors {{in the waters of}} rivers and <b>terminal</b> <b>lakes</b> within the Hulun Buir plateau, northeast China. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorous (TP) were significantly higher in <b>terminal</b> <b>lakes</b> than rivers waters (p  [*]<[*]  0. 01). Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that non-water light absorption and anthropogenic nutrient disturbances were the likely causes of the diversity of water quality parameters. CDOM absorption in river waters was significantly lower than <b>terminal</b> <b>lakes.</b> Analysis of the ratio of absorption at 250  to 365  nm (E 250 [*]:[*] 365), specific ultraviolet (UV) absorbance (SUVA 254), and the spectral slope ratio (S r) indicated that CDOM in river waters had higher aromaticity, molecular weight, and vascular plant contribution than in <b>terminal</b> <b>lakes.</b> Furthermore, results showed that DOC concentration, CDOM light absorption, and the proportion of autochthonous sources of CDOM in plateau waters were all higher than in other freshwater rivers reported in the literature. The strong evapoconcentration, intense ultraviolet irradiance, and landscape features of the Hulun Buir plateau may be responsible for the above phenomenon. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the environmental variables total suspended matter (TSM), TN, and electrical conductivity (EC) had a strong correlation with light absorption characteristics, followed by total dissolved solid (TDS) and chlorophyll a. In most sampling locations, CDOM was the dominant non-water light-absorbing substance. Light absorption by non-algal particles often exceeded that by phytoplankton in the plateau waters. Study of these optical–physicochemical correlations is helpful in the evaluation of the potential influence of water quality factors on non-water light absorption in cold plateau water environments. The construction of a correlation between DOC concentration and water quality factors may help contribute to regional estimates of carbon sources and fate for catchment carbon budget assessments...|$|R

2500|$|The city of Great Falls lies {{atop the}} Great Falls Tectonic Zone, an intracontinental shear zone between two {{geologic}} provinces of basement rock of the Archean period which {{form part of}} the North American continent. The city lies at the southern reach of the Laurentide ice sheet, a vast glacial sheet of ice which covered much of North America during the last glacial period. Approximately 1.5million years ago, the Missouri River flowed northward into a <b>terminal</b> <b>lake.</b> The Laurentide ice sheet pushed the river southward. Between 15,000 BCE and 11,000 BCE, the Laurentide ice sheet blocked the Missouri River and created Glacial Lake Great Falls. About 13,000 BCE, as the glacier retreated, Glacial Lake Great Falls emptied catastrophically in a glacial lake outburst flood. The current course of the Missouri River essentially marks the southern boundary of the Laurentide ice sheet. The Missouri River flowed eastward around the glacial mass, settling into its present course.

5000|$|The {{lake was}} given various names in ancient Chinese texts.

These early texts also mentioned the belief, mistaken as it turns out, that the lake joins the Yellow River through an underground channel {{as the source of}} the river. The lake was referred to as the [...] "Wandering Lake" [...] in the early 20th century due to the Tarim River changing its course, causing its <b>terminal</b> <b>lake</b> to alter its location between the Lop Nur dried basin, the Kara-Koshun dried basin and the Taitema Lake basin.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A recent {{empirical}} model of glacial-isostatic uplift {{showed that the}} Huron and Michigan lake level fell tens of meters below the lowest possible outlet about 7, 900 14 C years BP when the upper Great Lakes became dependent for water supply on precipitation alone, as at present. The upper Great Lakes thus {{appear to have been}} impacted by severe dry climate that may have also affected the lower Great Lakes. While continuing paleoclimate studies are corroborating and quantifying this impacting cli-mate and other evidence of <b>terminal</b> <b>lakes,</b> the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory applied their Advanced Hydrologic Prediction System, modified to use dynamic lake areas, to explore the devia-tions from present temperatures and precipitation that would force the Great <b>Lakes</b> to become <b>terminal</b> (closed), i. e., for water levels to fall below outlet sills. We modeled the present lakes with pre-develop-ment natural outlet and water flow conditions, but considered the upper and lower Great Lakes sepa-rately with no river connection, as in the early Holocene basin configuration. By using systematic shifts in precipitation, temperature, and humidity relative to the present base climate, we identified candidate climates that result in <b>terminal</b> <b>lakes.</b> The lakes would close in the order: Erie, Superior, Michigan-Huron, and Ontario for increasingly drier and warmer climates. For a temperature rise of TºC and a pre-cipitation drop of P % relative to the present base climate, conditions for complete lake closure range from 4. 7 T + P> 51 for Erie to 3. 5 T + P> 71 for Ontario...|$|R
