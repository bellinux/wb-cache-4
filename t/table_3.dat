5|$|Classifications {{published}} {{since the}} use of molecular phylogenetics have taken a narrower view of the Liliaceae (s.s.). In 1998, Tamura considered Calochortus sufficiently distinct to elevate the subfamily Calochortoideae to family status as Calochortaceae, resulting in the term Liliaceae sensu Tamura to indicate Liliaceae without the Calochortoideae. In 2009, Takhtajan used an even narrower definition (see Table 2 & <b>Table</b> <b>3</b> below).|$|E

5|$|Sequencing of the rbcL and matK {{chloroplast}} {{genes of}} Lilium and related genera confirmed the circumscription {{of the family}} in the sensu stricto usage of Tamura (1998). Chloroplast ndhF gene sequencing also supported Liliaceae monophyly, reuniting the Liliaceae sensu Tamura and Calochortaceae sensu Tamura (see Table 2 & <b>Table</b> <b>3</b> below).|$|E
5|$|Within the Liliaceae sensu Dahlgren there {{developed}} {{two main}} evolutionary subclades (see Cladogram II and <b>Table</b> <b>3).</b> The first of these, characterised as the Lilieae s.s. (Lilium, Fritillaria, Nomocharis), Cardiocrinum), Notholirion) diverged around 12mya. The second subclade was the Tulipeae (Erythronium, Tulipa), (Gagea). Divergence within Calochortus is dated to 7mya. This places {{the emergence of}} the Liliaceae at approximately the last (Maastrichtian period) of the Late Cretaceous periods (72 to 66mya) to early (Paleocene) Paleogene periods (66 to 23mya), formerly the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary, 65mya.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{now having}} {{established}} a taxonomic grouping for the Liliaceae family that is genetically monophyletic, {{compared to the}} prior longstanding polyphyletic assemblages under this name, the morphology remains diverse, and there exists within the Liliaceae clade a number of subclades. There appeared to be two major clades, the first and largest of these consisted of three subclades: Clintonia—Medeola—Gagea, Lilium Fritillaria—Notholirion, and Tulipa—Erythronium. The second smaller clade, Streptopus—Tricyrtis contained elements of Dahlgren's Uvulariaceae. The position of Calochortus remained problematic, being considered a sister clade to Liliaceae, as treated by Tamura, but further analysis suggested {{it was in fact}} sister to Tricyrtis, although it is now considered separate once again (see <b>Table</b> <b>3).</b>|$|E
