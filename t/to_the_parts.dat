5|$|During the 1970s {{and early}} 1980s the Department of the Environment {{assisted}} the Powis estate by lending government staff {{to repair the}} castle. Visitor numbers were falling, however, in part due the dilapidated condition of the property, and the estate became increasingly unable to afford to maintain the castle. After 1984, when {{the function of the}} department was taken over by English Heritage, a more systematic approach was put into place. This based around a partnership in which the Powis Estate would retain ownership of the castle and develop visitor access, in exchange for a £500,000 contribution from English Heritage for a jointly-funded programme of repairs and maintenance, delivered through specialist contractors. This included repairs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> of the curtain wall, which collapsed in 1990, and the redevelopment of the visitor's centre. Limited archaeological excavation was carried out in the outer bailey between 1992 and 1993 by the City of Hereford Archaeology Unit.|$|E

50|$|Markman and Wachtel's 1988 studies {{demonstrated}} {{the learning process}} through the whole-object and mutual exclusivity assumption. The experimenter told three-year-old children a word and then showed them a picture. She asked whether <b>the</b> label referred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> whole object or a part and outlined each option with her finger. When the whole object was unfamiliar they pointed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> in only 20% of the trials, but pointed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> in 57% of the trials when the object was familiar. A recent study attempted to replicate and extend these results. Hansen and Markman taught children a new word for {{a part of a}} real object by saying the word and tracing the object's contours. (These gestures were meant to remain as naturalistic as possible). They then asked children <b>to</b> point <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new <b>part</b> in order to identify if they have linked <b>the</b> new name <b>to</b> <b>the</b> intended <b>part.</b> <b>The</b> main manipulation was whether the object was familiar or not. Upholding the mutual exclusivity assumption children pointed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> intended <b>part</b> more often in the familiar object condition. Furthermore, the gesture of pointing/outlining <b>the</b> <b>part</b> itself was insufficient for children <b>to</b> learn <b>the</b> <b>part</b> name. Mutual exclusivity and a gesture were necessary for children <b>to</b> select <b>the</b> novel <b>part.</b>|$|R

25|$|Cerebral palsy {{is caused}} by {{abnormal}} development or damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> {{of the brain that}} control movement, balance and posture. Most often the problems occur during pregnancy; however, they may also occur during childbirth, or shortly after birth. Often the cause is unknown. Risk factors include preterm birth, being a twin, certain infections during pregnancy such as toxoplasmosis or rubella, exposure to methylmercury during pregnancy, a difficult delivery, and head trauma during {{the first few years of}} life, among others. About 2% of cases are believed to be due to an inherited genetic cause. A number of sub-types are classified based on the specific problems present. For example, those with stiff muscles have spastic cerebral palsy, those with poor coordination have ataxic cerebral palsy, and those with writhing movements have athetoid cerebral palsy. Diagnosis is based on the child's development over time. Blood tests and medical imaging may be used to rule out other possible causes.|$|E

In 1850 the Salesians of Annecy (Savoy, France) were sent out to take charge of the country between the Rivers Godavery and Mahanuddy, which was at the same time created a vicariate Apostolic. In the same year, the country between the Chittagong and Kabudak River was created a vicariate Apostolic, committed to the care of the Fathers of the Holy Cross; {{at about the same time}} the Fathers of Missions etrangeres of Paris replaced the Italian Barnabites in Burma. Thus the Diocese of Mylapur was divided up between six vicariates: Madura, Pondicherry, Madras, Vizagapatam, Western Bengal, and Eastern Bengal and Burma.|$|E
