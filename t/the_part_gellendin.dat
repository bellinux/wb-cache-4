40|$|Chemical {{composition}} {{in different parts}} of banana pulp was determined.

50|$|Pull-through AC demagnetizing coils: seen in {{the figure}} to the right are AC powered devices that {{generate}} a high magnetic field where <b>the</b> <b>part</b> is slowly pulled through by hand or on a conveyor. The act of pulling <b>the</b> <b>part</b> through {{and away from the}} coil's magnetic field slows drops the magnetic field in <b>the</b> <b>part.</b> Note that many AC demagnetizing coils have power cycles of several seconds so <b>the</b> <b>part</b> must be passed through the coil and be several feet (meters) away before the demagnetizing cycle finishes or <b>the</b> <b>part</b> will have residual magnetization.|$|R
50|$|Die {{castings}} {{and permanent}} mold castings commonly contain internal porosity. This porosity is generally localized to the deepest cross-sections of <b>the</b> <b>part</b> {{and does not}} extend to the outer skin. However, if <b>the</b> <b>part</b> is also machined, the internal porosity will be exposed and <b>the</b> <b>part</b> will leak if pressurized. Machined die castings that need to hold fluids (intake manifolds, coolant connectors, transmission cases, pump housings and fluid power components) are routinely sealed for life using acrylic resins. Because the sealant is internal to <b>the</b> <b>part,</b> <b>the</b> exterior dimensions and appearance of <b>the</b> <b>part</b> are unchanged.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} automatic dimensioning of cylindrical parts represented by features.

The dimensions are determined with the aid of an expert system. 1...|$|R
50|$|Normally all {{rotation}} molding {{systems have}} a number of parts including molds, oven, cooling chamber and mold spindles. The molds are used to create <b>the</b> <b>part,</b> and are typically made of aluminium. The quality and finish of the product {{is directly related to the}} quality of the mold being used. The oven is used to heat <b>the</b> <b>part</b> while also rotating <b>the</b> <b>part</b> to form <b>the</b> <b>part</b> desired. <b>The</b> cooling chamber is where <b>the</b> <b>part</b> is placed until it cools, and the spindles are mounted to rotate and provide a uniform coat of plastic inside each mold.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} types of stove identified.

The second type is quadrangular for <b>the</b> <b>part</b> used in putting firewood. It also has low walls around the edges. Lastly the third stove type has a similar quadrangular shape for <b>the</b> <b>part</b> used in putting firewood, and a cylindrical shape with quadrangular cut in front for <b>the</b> <b>part</b> used in burning. It looks like a ring from the top and three small cleats are attached around the ring.|$|R
5000|$|After <b>the</b> <b>part</b> {{has been}} {{magnetized}} {{it needs to}} be demagnetized. This requires special equipment that works the opposite way of the magnetizing equipment. The magnetization is normally done with a high current pulse that reaches a peak current very quickly and instantaneously turns off leaving <b>the</b> <b>part</b> magnetized. To demagnetize a <b>part,</b> <b>the</b> current or magnetic field needed has to be equal to or greater than the current or magnetic field used to magnetize <b>the</b> <b>part.</b> <b>The</b> current or magnetic field is then slowly reduced to zero, leaving <b>the</b> <b>part</b> demagnetized.|$|R
