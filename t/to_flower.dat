In a sunny field of flowers, Thumbelina meets a tiny flower-fairy prince just her size and to her liking, and they wed. She receives a pair of wings to accompany her husband on his travels from flower <b>to</b> <b>flower,</b> and a new name, Maia.|$|E
5|$|Coastal plants begin <b>to</b> <b>flower</b> {{at around}} {{five years from}} seed, but plants in the Stirling Range take much longer to mature. In one Stirling Range population, only 15% of plants had flowered after eight years. Flowering time is highly variable, but in general it occurs between March and August, with a peak around June. More flowers open during the day than at night.|$|E

5|$|Many cultivars {{have been}} {{selected}} for horticultural use, either selected forms or hybrids with other Grevillea species. One prominent early breeder was Leo Hodge of W Tree, Victoria. Hodge became interested in breeding grevilleas after finding seedlings in his garden. His first trials involved crossing G.juniperina with G.victoriae, producing G.Poorinda Queen', {{which was the first}} <b>to</b> <b>flower,</b> followed by G.Poorinda Constance', G.Poorinda Leane' and G.Poorinda Pink Coral' respectively, all in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Most modern cultivars lack any {{fragrance}} although 'Dancing Queen' {{represents an}} exception. Fragrance is genetically related <b>to</b> <b>flower</b> colour (white, or pastel shades) {{and is a}} recessive characteristic, so that when fragrant and non fragrant varieties are crossed, not all progeny will be fragrant, whereas two fragrant progenitors will produce an all fragrant progeny.|$|E

40|$|Time <b>to</b> <b>flowering</b> {{is central}} in {{determining}} the adaptation and productivity of chickpea in short-season temperate environ-ments. We studied the genetic control of this trait in three crosses, 272 - 2 CDC Anna, 298 T- 9 CDC Anna, and 298 T- 9 CDC Frontier. From each cross, 180 F 2 plants and parents were evaluated for time <b>to</b> <b>flowering</b> under greenhouse conditions. In summer 2004, multiple generations including P 1, F 1, P 2, F 2, and F 2 : 3 (also called MG 5) were evaluated for time <b>to</b> <b>flowering</b> under field conditions. The data on time <b>to</b> <b>flowering</b> in the F 2 populations were continuous in distribution but deviated from normal distribution. The F 2 : 3 families derived from this showed a bimodal distribution for time <b>to</b> <b>flowering,</b> a typical case of major-gene inheritance model with duplicate recessive epistasis. A joint segregation analysis of MG 5 also revealed that time <b>to</b> <b>flowering</b> in chickpea was controlled by two major genes along with other polygenes. Late flowering was dominant over early flowering for both major genes with digenic interaction between them, mainly an additive additive type. This information {{can be used to}} formulate the most efficient breeding strategy for improvement of time <b>to</b> <b>flowering</b> in chickpea in short-season temperate environments. Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) crops often experience short growing seasons as a result of drought, heat, or end-of-season frost (Khanna-Chopra and Sinha 1987). Early flowering i...|$|R

5|$|Not {{commonly}} cultivated, it adapts {{readily to}} garden conditions and tolerates most soils in part-shade or full sun. The colours of the inflorescences in bud, {{and timing of}} flowers into winter give it horticultural value, as does its reddish new growth. Larger plants have taller flower spikes. It is propagated readily from seed, with young plants taking {{five to seven years}} <b>to</b> <b>flower</b> from seed. Pruning can improve the shrub's appearance, and it is a potential bonsai subject.|$|E
5|$|The long-pink and short-white races {{frequently}} {{occur in}} close proximity to each other; in these mixed populations the former tends <b>to</b> <b>flower</b> in winter and the latter in spring. The question has been raised whether these different forms are becoming incompatible. However, controlled cross-pollination between plants with short and long corollas showed that there was no incompatibility between them.|$|E
5|$|According {{to current}} knowledge, B.sessilis as an {{extremely}} hardy plant that {{grows in a}} range of soils and aspects, so long as it is given good drainage, and tolerates both drought and moderate frost. Unlike many dryandras, it grows well on limestone (alkaline) soils. It flowers very heavily and is an excellent producer of honey. It attracts birds, and is also popular with beekeepers. However, its size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens, and if given an ideal situation it may produce a great many seedlings. It is propagated only from seed, as propagating it from cuttings has proven virtually impossible. Germination takes about five or six weeks, and plants may take two years <b>to</b> <b>flower.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of concentration and time of foliar spraying of nitrogen fertilizer as complementary of soil nutrition on dry matter remobilization and seed and oil yield of rapeseed (Hyola 401), an experiment was conducted in complete randomized block design with 16 treatments and three replications in two years (2008 - 2010) in Rice Research Institute of Iran (Rasht). In this experiment, nitrogen concentration (from urea source) at two levels (5 and 10 ppm) and application time in seven levels including 1 -seedling stage at 6 - 8 leaves 2 : beginning of stem elongation, 3 : prior <b>to</b> <b>flowering,</b> 4 : 6 - 8 leaves + stem elongation, 5 : 6 - 8 leaves + prior <b>to</b> <b>flowering,</b> 6 : stem elongation+ prior <b>to</b> <b>flowering,</b> 7 : 6 - 8 leaves + stem elongation+ prior <b>to</b> <b>flowering</b> plus two control treatments including zero nitrogen fertilizer and conventional fertilization (180 kg. ha- 1) at seed sowing, stem elongation and prior <b>to</b> <b>flowering</b> in equal rates, were considered. Results showed that foliar application of nitrogen (10 ppm) in 6 - 8 leaves+stem elongation+prior <b>to</b> <b>flowering</b> stage had the highest dry matter remobilization (612. 2 g. m- 2), current rate of photosynthesis (3074 g. m- 2), and grain yield (3686. 2 kg. ha- 1). Calculation of regression coefficients showed that dry matter remobilization had linear and positive relationship with grain yield (r 2 = 0. 95 **). According {{to the results of}} the present experiment, it seems that foliar application of nitrogen (10 ppm) at 6 - 8 leaves + stem elongation+ prior <b>to</b> <b>flowering</b> stage and stem elongation+ prior <b>to</b> <b>flowering</b> stage increases dry matter remobilization, seed and oil yields...|$|R
5|$|At , it {{is a small}} honeyeater with a short {{tail and}} {{relatively}} long down-curved bill. It is sexually dimorphic; the male has a glossy red head and brown upperparts and paler grey-brown underparts while the female has predominantly grey-brown plumage. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical mangrove forests. It is very active when feeding in the tree canopy, darting from flower <b>to</b> <b>flower</b> and gleaning insects off foliage. It calls constantly as it feeds. While little has been documented on the red-headed myzomela's breeding behaviour, it is recorded as building a small cup-shaped nest in the mangroves and laying two or three oval, white eggs with small red blotches.|$|E
5|$|B.telmatiaea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It grows fairly quickly, but tends to become untidy as it ages. The flower spikes, though attractive, occur within the bush {{where they are}} usually {{obscured}} by foliage. In its natural habitat it flowers prolifically over several months, but according to George it may be reluctant <b>to</b> <b>flower</b> in cultivation. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage. George recommends a sunny position in poorly drained soil, preferably with moisture in winter. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take around 14 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to {{six years}} <b>to</b> <b>flower</b> from seed, {{though there is a}} report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E

40|$|Time <b>to</b> <b>flowering</b> and {{maturity}} {{is an important}} adaptive feature in annual crops, including cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.). In West and Central Africa, photoperiod {{is the most important}} environmental variable affecting time <b>to</b> <b>flowering</b> in cowpea. The inheritance of time from sowing <b>to</b> <b>flowering</b> (f) in cowpeas was studied by crossing a photoperiod-sensitive genotype Kanannnado to a photoperiod-insensitive variety IT 97 D- 941 - 1. Sufficient seed of F- 1, F- 2, F- 3 and backcross populations were generated. The parental, F- 1, F- 2, F- 3 and the backcross populations were screened for f under long natural days (mean daylength 13. 4 h per day) in the field and the parents, F- 1, F- 2 and backcross populations under short day (10 h per day) conditions. The result of the screening showed that photoperiod in the field was long enough <b>to</b> delay <b>flowering</b> of photoperiod-sensitive genotypes. Photoperiod-sensitivity was found to be partially dominant to insensitivity. Frequency distribution of the trait in the various populations indicated quantitative inheritance. Additive (d) and additive x dominance (j) interactions were the most important gene actions conditioning time <b>to</b> <b>flowering.</b> A narrow sense heritability of 86 % was estimated for this trait. This will result in 26 days gain in time <b>to</b> <b>flowering</b> with 5 % selection intensity from the F- 2 to F- 3 generation. At least seven major gene pairs, with an average delay of 6 days each, were estimated to control time <b>to</b> <b>flowering</b> in this cross...|$|R
5|$|Banksia paludosa {{subspecies}} paludosa is a slow-growing shrub which regenerates from bushfire by resprouting {{from its}} lignotuber. After fire, plants take around three years <b>to</b> <b>flower</b> significantly, but are flowering well by five years afterwards. Flowerhead numbers dwindle by fourteen years post bushfire. Plants {{are estimated to}} live to around 60 years of age. Seedlings also appear from seed dispersed after bushfire. All banksias have developed proteoid or cluster roots {{in response to the}} nutrient-poor conditions of Australian soils (particularly lacking in phosphorus).|$|E
5|$|Bottle trees grow best in well-drained, {{slightly}} acidic soil, in full sunshine. They are {{suited to}} cultivation in regional climates equivalent to USDA hardiness zones 9 to 12. In the first stages of growth, the bottle tree is very slow-growing, {{and the formation}} of the unique bottle shape is not visible until the tree is about 5 to 8 years old. Mature trees transplant easily, and can withstand intervals of up to three months between digging and replanting without detriment. Bottle trees grown from seed may take up to 20 years <b>to</b> <b>flower.</b> Flowering takes place after adult leaves have appeared.|$|E
5|$|Carrots {{benefit from}} {{strongly}} scented companion plants. The pungent odour of onions, leeks and chives help repel the carrot root fly, and other vegetables that team well with carrots include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, {{as well as}} the herbs rosemary and sage. Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy. They can also be good companions for other plants; if left <b>to</b> <b>flower,</b> the carrot, like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.|$|E

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium, {{commonly}} known as common cottongrass or common cottonsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family Cyperaceae. Native to North America, North Asia, and Northern Europe, it grows on peat or acidic soils, in open wetland, heath or moorland. It begins <b>to</b> <b>flower</b> in April or May and, after fertilisation in early summer, the small, unremarkable brown and green flowers develop distinctive white bristle-like seed-heads that resemble tufts of cotton; combined with its ecological suitability to bog, these characteristics give rise to the plant's alternative name, bog cotton.|$|E
5|$|Floral buds are {{produced}} year-round on {{the tips of}} new growth, but only those initiated between November and May go on <b>to</b> <b>flower</b> several months later. Flowering usually takes place from July to November (late winter to early summer) in the golden wattle's native range; because the later buds develop faster, flowering peaks over July and August. The bright yellow inflorescences occur in groups of 40 to 80 on -long racemes that arise from axillary buds. Each inflorescence is a ball-like structure that is covered by 40 to 100 small flowers that have five tiny petals (pentamerous) and long erect stamens, which give the flower head a fluffy appearance.|$|E
