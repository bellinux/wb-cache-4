5|$|In the {{planning}} for Operation Mars in November, the division {{was given a}} leading role in the 20th Army's assault. Alongside the 247th Rifle Division, and supported by the 80th and 240th Tank Brigades, the 331st was tasked to cross the mostly-frozen Vazuza River between Trostino and Pechora, to take German strong points at Zevalovka and Prudy. On the second day, the second German defensive position would be taken. Following this the division would cross the railroad between Rzhev and Sychyovka, and reduce the German strong point at Khlepen. In the event, on November 25, the division successfully forced the river line and took Prudy, but was halted by heavy fire from Khlepen. The 247th had made greater progress and the rest of the 331st reinforced that bridgehead. Overnight, the front commander, General I.S. Konev, decided to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> a mobile reserve force through this scant lodgement to complete the breakthrough. The following day the two rifle divisions continued to struggle to expand the bridgehead, but with little success. The tanks and cavalry of the reserve managed to tear a hole in the defenses and get into the enemy rear, but the infantry found it impossible to follow. The gains made by the 331st over the following days were negligible. For most of the remainder of the operation the division held the left flank of its army, recovering from its losses. In the period from November 25 to December 18 the division lost 597 men killed, 1,445 wounded, and 106 missing-in-action, for a total of 2,148 casualties.|$|E

Khalilzad explained that the United States will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> another resolution in the U.N. Security Council under Chapter 7, to impose additional sanctions on Iran.|$|E
25|$|Bulldust {{moves his}} herd south as well, {{but when they}} <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through a forest, {{they are forced to}} flee when a fire erupts. Taking {{advantage}} of the chaos, a pack of carnivores, led by a Gorgosaurus named Gorgon, attacks the scattered herd. They kill the rest of Patchi and Scowler's family, with Gorgon personally killing Bulldust. Afterwards, Patchi's herd combines with Juniper's as they continue their migration. Gorgon's pack attacks them again; in the ensuing panic, Patchi, Scowler, and Juniper fall into the river and are swept downstream to the ocean, with Alex following them from above. At a beach, Scowler follows a herd of Edmontosaurus to find food, callously leaving Patchi and Juniper behind. The two make their way through a forest and eventually are able to find their herd and Scowler.|$|E

25|$|Le Barbier premiered in 1775. Its sequel, Le Mariage, was {{initially}} {{passed by the}} censor in 1781, but was soon banned from being performed by Louis XVI after a private reading. Queen Marie-Antoinette lamented the ban, as did various influential members of her entourage. Nonetheless, the King was unhappy with the play's satire on the aristocracy and overruled the Queen's entreaties to allow its performance. Over the next three years, Beaumarchais gave many private readings of the play, as well as making revisions to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> the censor. The King finally relented and lifted the ban in 1784. The play premiered that year and was enormously popular even with aristocratic audiences. Mozart's opera premiered just two years later. Beaumarchais's final play, La Mère, premiered in 1792 in Paris.|$|E
25|$|On 12 January 2016, PSOE and C's {{reached an}} {{agreement}} to elect former Lehendakari Patxi López as new President of the Congress, who required {{a second round of}} voting as a result of lacking an absolute majority to be elected in the first ballot. After the PSOE-C's accord was announced, the PP reluctantly withdrew its candidate due to lack of support from other parties, while Podemos proposed Carolina Bescansa for the post, gathering the support of IU. The next week, King Felipe VI started a round of talks with the different political parties in order to nominate a candidate for Prime Minister—a formateur. Rajoy initially announced he would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> the investiture vote despite not having the support from any other party aside from his own, while Albert Rivera stated his will to try to mediate between PP and PSOE so that an agreement could be reached.|$|E
500|$|Jewish {{characters}} <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> {{themselves off}} as ethnic Poles by tying pig masks to their faces, with the strings showing at the back. [...] Vladek's disguise was more convincing than Anja's—"you {{could see she}} was more Jewish", Vladek says. [...] Spiegelman shows this Jewishness by having her tail hang out of her disguise. [...] This literalization of the genocidal stereotypes that drove the Nazis to their Final Solution may risk reinforcing racist labels, but Spiegelman uses the idea to create anonymity for the characters. [...] According to art historian Andrea Liss, this may paradoxically enable the reader to identify with the characters as human, preventing the reader from observing racial characteristics based on facial traits, while reminding readers that racist classification is ever present.|$|E

Emily Williams Kelly told The New York Times: [...] "Presumably, if someone had a vivid dream about him, in which {{there seemed to be a}} word or a phrase that kept being repeated—I don't quite know how it would work—if it seemed promising enough, we would try to open it using the combination suggested."

The investiture was set to start on 1 March, with the first ballot—required for the legal two months period to call a new election to start running—being scheduled for 2 March, automatically setting the date of a hypothetical new election for 26 June. Rajoy warned against a possible PSOE–Podemos pact and expressed his wish for Sánchez to fail in his attempt and later attempt a three-way [...] "moderate" [...] alliance with PSOE and C's himself. It was widely reported that the PP heavily favoured going into an early election, and it confirmed that it would vote against any candidate different than Rajoy.|$|E
2500|$|Mami Wata {{is often}} {{described}} as a mermaid-like figure, with a woman's upper body (often nude) and the hindquarters of a fish or serpent. In other tales, Mami Wata is fully human in appearance (though never human). The existence and spiritual importance of Mami Wata is deeply rooted in the ancient tradition and mythology of the coastal southeastern Nigerians (Efik, Ibibio and Annang people). [...] Mami Wata often carries expensive baubles such as combs, mirrors, and watches. A large snake (symbol of divination and divinity) frequently accompanies her, wrapping itself around her and laying its head between her breasts. Other times, she may <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> as completely human, wandering busy markets or patronising bars. She may also manifest {{in a number of other}} forms, including as a man. Traders in the 20th century carried similar beliefs with them from Senegal to as far as Zambia. As the Mami Wata traditions continues to re-emerge, native water deities were subsumed into it.|$|E
