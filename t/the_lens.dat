5|$|By {{combining}} the wide angle focal lengths with narrow apertures, <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> provides strong {{depth of field}} rather than making blurred backgrounds. <b>The</b> <b>lens</b> is constructed with a hybrid aspherical lens that when combined with two glass mold elements provides excellent correction for distortion as well as astigmatism.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{conditions}} which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation, a heritable condition. This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal {{and begin to}} disintegrate in affected dogs. The fibres support <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> of the eye, and their destruction can cause <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> {{to fall into the}} wrong location within the eye. If <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> falls into the anterior chamber of eyeball then a secondary glaucoma can occur, causing loss of vision. National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, broken down into three groups; clears, carriers, and affecteds.|$|E

50|$|Frames {{can be made}} to hold <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> {{in several}} {{different}} ways. There are three common styles: full frame, half frame, and frameless. Full frame glasses have the frame go all around <b>the</b> <b>lenses.</b> Half frames go around only half the lens; typically the frames attach to the top of <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> and on <b>the</b> side near the top. Frameless glasses have no frame around <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> and <b>the</b> ear stems are attached directly to <b>the</b> <b>lenses.</b> There are two styles of frameless glasses: those that have a piece of frame material connecting <b>the</b> two <b>lenses,</b> and those that are a single lens with ear stems on each side.|$|R
30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Fig. 5 <b>the</b> second <b>lens</b> and <b>the</b> third <b>lens,</b> as well as <b>the</b> fourth <b>lens</b> and <b>the</b> fifth <b>lens</b> are {{laminated}} in the initial structure. It is necessary to separate <b>the</b> second <b>lens</b> from <b>the</b> third <b>lens</b> and <b>the</b> fourth <b>lens</b> from <b>the</b> fifth <b>lens</b> to prevent degumming in space environment. Thus, the structure of the optical system needs to be optimized. Furthermore, the small volume and mass of star sensor can be reached by minimizing the radial and axial dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>lenses.</b> By considering optical parameters in Table 3, Double Gauss system is designed and optimized by ZEMAX optical design software.|$|R
50|$|Electromagnetic stigmators are stigmators {{that are}} {{integrated}} with <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> and directly deform {{the magnetic field}} of <b>the</b> <b>lens(es).</b> These were <b>the</b> first types of stigmators to be used.|$|R
5|$|The only {{physical}} {{controls on}} <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> are the AF/MF toggle switch {{and the two}} rings, controlling the zoom and focus. <b>The</b> <b>lens</b> does not have image stabilization.

5|$|Lens luxation, {{also known}} as ectopia lentis {{is the most common}} {{hereditary}} disorder in Jack Russell terriers. Even so, this condition is not a common occurrence in the breed. Most frequently appearing in dogs between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, it is where <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> in one or both eyes becomes displaced. There are two types, posterior luxation (where <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> slips {{to the back of the}} eye) and anterior luxation (where <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> slips forward). Posterior luxation is the less severe of the two types, as the eye can appear normal although the dog's eyesight will be affected. In anterior luxation, <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> can slip forward and rub against the cornea, damaging it. Anterior luxation also has a high probability of causing glaucoma which can lead to partial or complete blindness. Treatment is available and may include both medical and surgical options. Secondary lens luxation is caused by trauma to the eye and is not hereditary. The condition appears in a number of terrier breeds as well as the Border collie, Brittany and Cardigan Welsh corgi.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lens</b> {{features}} a hypersonic zoom motor for its autofocus, {{which is considered}} to be a fast and quiet design. In addition, manual override is allowed in the single-shot autofocus mode. <b>The</b> <b>lens,</b> which focuses internally, has one of the lowest maximum magnification measurements in its class (which includes the Canon 10–18mm and 10–22mm, Sigma 10–20mm f/3.5 and Sigma 10–20mm f/4–5.6 EX DC HSM, Tamron 10–24mm f/3.5–4.5 DI II, Nikon 10–24mm f/3.5–4.5G ED AF-S DX, and Tokina 11–16mm f/2.8 AT-X Pro DX lenses). The lens' autofocus feature is not functional with Pentax ist* series and K100D DSLR cameras that do not support hypersonic zoom mechanics. <b>The</b> <b>lens</b> is capable of focusing from infinity to minimum focusing distance and back in under a second: so micro focusing is rapid. However, because of the narrow focus range (0.13x) <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> is not suitable for macro photography.|$|E

5|$|Hyperoxic myopia has {{occurred}} in closed circuit oxygen rebreather divers with prolonged exposures. It also occurs frequently in those undergoing repeated hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

It is usually reversible with time.|$|E
5|$|In a {{panoramic}} camera, the focal-plane shutter {{was replaced by}} a rotation of 180° of <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> itself.

5000|$|Huygens eyepieces {{consist of}} two plano-convex <b>lenses</b> with <b>the</b> plane sides towards the eye {{separated}} by an air gap. <b>The</b> <b>lenses</b> are called <b>the</b> eye <b>lens</b> and <b>the</b> field <b>lens.</b> <b>The</b> focal plane is located between <b>the</b> two <b>lenses.</b> It {{was invented by}} Christiaan Huygens in the late 1660s {{and was the first}} compound (multi-lens) eyepiece.

30|$|In this work, liquid colour-changing lenses for vision protection, {{camouflage}} {{and optical}} filtering are developed by circulating colour liquids through microfluidic channels on <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> manually. Soft lithography technology {{is applied to}} fabricate the silicone liquid colour-changing layers with microfluidic channels on <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> instead of mechanical machining. To increase the hardness and abrasion resistance of the silicone colour-changing layers on <b>the</b> <b>lenses,</b> proper fabrication parameters such as 6 : 1 (mass ration) mixing proportion and 100  °C curing temperature for 2  h are approved for better soft lithography process of <b>the</b> <b>lenses.</b> Meanwhile, a new surface treatment for the irreversible bonding of silicone colour-changing layer with optical resin (CR 39) substrate lens by using 5  % (volume ratio) 3 -Aminopropyltriethoxysilane solution is proposed. Vision protection, camouflage and optical filtering functions of <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> are investigated with different designs of the channels and multi-layer structures. Each application can not only well achieve their functional demands, but also shows the advantages of functional flexibility, rapid prototyping and good controllability compared with traditional ways. Besides optometry, some other designs and applications of <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> are proposed for potential utility in the future.|$|R

5|$|The eyes of {{pinnipeds}} {{are relatively}} large for {{their size and}} are positioned {{near the front of}} the head. One exception is the walrus, whose smaller eyes are located on the sides of its head. This is because it feeds on immobile bottom dwelling mollusks and hence does not need acute vision. A seal's eye is adapted for seeing both underwater and in air. <b>The</b> <b>lens</b> is mostly spherical, and much of the retina is equidistant from <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> center. The cornea has a flattened center where refraction is nearly equal in both water and air. Pinnipeds also have very muscular and vascularized irises. The well-developed dilator muscle gives the animals a great range in pupil dilation. When contracted, the pupil is typically pear-shaped, although the bearded seal's is more diagonal. In species that live in shallow water, such as harbor seals and California sea lions, dilation varies little, while the deep-diving elephant seals have much greater variation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} what happens when two anticyclonic lens-like eddies with different densities come in contact with each other by, say, an advective current. We usc laboratory and numerical experiments to demonstrate that, in a similar fashion to lenses with identical densities which often merge, lenses with unequal densities often align (i. e. <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> "strive " toward a state where one lens is situated on top of the other). The two initially isolated eddies are formed in the laboratory by continuously injecting salty water through small filters situated in the interface separating two environmental l yers. Hence, there is a total of four different fluids with graduated ensities in the tank. The heaviest water is the lowest layer. One of <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> is slightly lighter than this heaviest water and the other is still lighter than <b>the</b> first <b>lens.</b> Finally, thc upper layer is the lightest of the four. Since <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> are formed by injection, weak anticyclones which extend beyond the boundary of <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> are formed above and below <b>the</b> <b>lenses.</b> Due to <b>the</b> continuous injection of fluid into <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> they grow slowly so that after some time their edges meet. As in merging of lenses with identical densities, arms are then extended from one vortex to the other. However, in the present case the arms are situated above the heavier vortex and below the lighter vortex instead of being at the same level. At this point, <b>the</b> <b>lenses</b> are locke...|$|R

5|$|To {{capture the}} straight-on {{shot of the}} shower head, the camera had to be {{equipped}} with a long lens.

5|$|As all lens systems, natural {{vignetting}} (gradual {{reduction of}} an image's brightness {{from the center}} towards the periphery) is present due to Lambert's cosine law – this becomes more pronounced at shorter focal lengths. Wide open at 8mm, about 0.75 EVs of shading are apparent at the corners, while at 16mm only about 0.25 EV of shading is noticeable when comparing the corners to the center. For most of the focal length range of <b>the</b> <b>lens,</b> there is between a half stop and third stop of corner shading. Alternatively, stopping down to higher f-numbers lessens vignetting.|$|E
