40|$|Genetic {{engineering}} {{has been}} used for the fusion of peptides, with different length and composition, on a protein to study the effect on partitioning in aqueous two-phase systems containing thermoseparating polymers. Peptides containing 2 - 6 tryptophan residues or tryptophan plus 1 - 3 lysine or aspartate residues, were fused near the C-terminus of the recombinant protein ZZT 0, where Z is a synthetic IgG-binding domain derived from domain B in staphylococcal protein A. The partitioning behavior of the peptides and fusion proteins were studied in an aqueous two-phase system composed of dextran and the thermoseparating ethylene oxide-propylene oxide random copolymer, EO 30 PO 70. The zwitterionic compound beta-alanine was used to reduce the charge-dependent salt effects on partitioning, and to evaluate the contribution to the partition coefficient from the amino acid residues, Trp, Lys, and Asp, respectively. Trp was found to direct the fusion proteins to the EO-PO copolymer phase, while Asp and Lys directed them to the dextran phase. The effect of sodium perchlorate and triethylammonium phosphate on the partitioning of the fusion proteins was also studied. Salt effects were directly proportional to the net charge of the fusion proteins. Sodium perchlorate was found to be 3. 5 times more effective in directing positively charged proteins to the EO-PO copolymer phase compared to the effect of <b>triethyl</b> ammonium <b>phosphate</b> on negatively charged proteins. An empirical correlation has been tested where the fusion protein partitioning is a result of independent contributions from unmodified protein, fused peptide, and salt effects. A good agreement with experimental data was obtained which indicates the possibility, by independent measurements of partitioning of target protein and fusion peptide, to approximately predict the fusion protein partitioning. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|The {{results of}} a search for {{chemicals}} affecting the reproduction of the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch are recorded. The arrhenotokous type of reproduction of the spider mites has meant that male sterilization does not hold any great advantage over female sterilization. The present investigation was therefore concentrated on chemicals suppressing reproduction in the females. Contiguous to this study is {{a review of the}} literature with particular reference to the range of chemicals which can act as chemosterilants, the processes of chemical induction of sterility, and the biology and habits of T. urticae. An understanding of the latter is of fundamental importance before any application of chemosterilants can be contemplated. Preliminary tests with candidate chemosterilants were carried out and of those chemicals showing activity, the trialkyl phosphate group was selected for further study owing to the relatively low toxicity, ease of synthesis and sterilizing properties of some chemicals in this group. Trimethyl phosphate, <b>triethyl</b> <b>phosphate,</b> dimethyl methylphosphonate and diethyl cyanomethylphosphonate reduced egg lay and egg hatch while trimethyl thiophosphate reduced egg lay alone. Experiments indicated that trimethyl phosphate was a more active reproduction suppressant than trimethyl phosphate but showed a degree of chemical instability. <b>Triethyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> was therefore used for comparison with diethyl cyanomethylphosphonate for residual effects and the permanency of sterility induced by the chemicals.

K. fragilis beta-galactosidase lost activity rapidly (within 30 min) in all mixtures examined. The enzymes from E. coli and A. oryzae retained significant activity during extended periods (120 h) and are suitable for synthetic experiments. The level of activity depended on the enzyme and organic component of the solvent in the order tetraglyme > <b>triethyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> > monoglyme > triglyme = trimethyl phosphate > diglyme > diethylene glycol diethyl ether > 2 -methoxyethyl acetate > acetone = acetonitrile (zero activity) for the E. coli enzyme and methoxyethyl acetate > trimethyl phosphate > <b>triethyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> > monoglyme > acetone approximate to diglyme approximate to triglyme approximate to tetraglyme > diethyleneglycol diethyl ether > acetonitrile for the A. oryzae enzyme. The decay in hydrolytic activity over time was exponential, and in some cases biphasic with the second decay phase being an order of magnitude slower than the first. The reduction in enzyme activity was shown to be reversible with respect to the removal of organic solvent by dialysis and is attributed to changes in substrate solvation as well as partial enzyme denaturation. Changes in V-max/K-M for the beta-galactosidase-catalysed hydrolysis of 2 -nitrophenyi-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPGal) are weakly correlated with lipophilicity of the added cosolvent.

The AWRP treats secondary wastewater by ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis (RO) and ultraviolet radiation (UV) to produce recycled water for groundwater replenishment.

The target screening of 291 compounds detected a total of 13 chemicals in post-RO and post-UV water, including 2 corrosion inhibitors (4 + 5 -methyl- 1 H-benzotriazole, benzotriazole), 3 pesticides (metolachlor, propiconazol, prosulfocarb), 3 pharmaceuticals (lamotrigin, metformin, tramadol), 1 personal care product (galaxalidone), 3 artificial sweeteners (saccharin, acesulfame, sucralose) and 1 flame retardant (<b>triethyl</b> <b>phosphate).</b> The corrosion inhibitors benzotriazole and 4 + 5 -methyl- 1 H-benzotriazole, and the pharmaceutical metformin were detected in hundreds of ng L− 1, while the other compounds were present in low ng L− 1 concentrations. Analysis of UV treated water samples showed that UV treatment also helped to reduced UV degradable compounds such as the corrosion inhibitors (> 50 % removal), <b>triethyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> (~ 50 % removal) and the artificial sweetener acesulfame (~ 95 % removal).
