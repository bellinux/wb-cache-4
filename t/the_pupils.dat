50|$|The iris is a {{contractile}} structure, consisting {{mainly of}} smooth muscle, surrounding <b>the</b> <b>pupil.</b> Light enters <b>the</b> eye through <b>the</b> <b>pupil,</b> and <b>the</b> iris regulates {{the amount of}} light by controlling the size of <b>the</b> <b>pupil.</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{image-based}} {{technique for}} measuring the complex field in <b>the</b> <b>pupil</b> of an imaging system is presented. Two point source images, one with a small modification introduced in <b>the</b> <b>pupil,</b> are combined using a simple and non-iterative algorithm. The non-interferometric method {{is based on the}} change in the optical transfer function (OTF), giving a differential OTF (dOTF). The dOTF includes two images of <b>the</b> complex <b>pupil</b> field, conjugated and reflected about the position of <b>the</b> <b>pupil</b> modification, leaving an overlap that obscures some <b>the</b> <b>the</b> <b>pupil.</b> <b>The</b> overlap can be minimized by introducing the modification near the edge of <b>the</b> <b>pupil.</b> <b>The</b> overlap region can be eliminated altogether by using a second modification and a third point source image. <b>The</b> <b>pupil</b> field is convolved by the change in <b>the</b> <b>pupil</b> field, so smaller modification areas are preferred. The non-monochromatic light, but the result incurs a proportional radial blurring determined by the fractional bandwidth. We include some simple demonstration experiments, including using a pupil blockage and moving a single deformable mirror actuator as <b>the</b> <b>pupil</b> modification. In each case the complex wavefront is easily recovered, even when <b>the</b> <b>pupil</b> mask is unknown and the wavefront aberrations are large. Comment: 13 pages, 14 figures.

50|$|Pupillary {{response}} is a physiological response that varies {{the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>pupil,</b> via <b>the</b> optic and oculomotor cranial nerve.

Dilation of <b>the</b> <b>pupil</b> occurs when <b>the</b> smooth cells of the radial muscle, controlled by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), contract.

The assassins seized the castle and eventually their families and friends took refuge with them, about a hundred and fifty men in all. Among their friends was Henry Balnaves, a former secretary of state in the government, who negotiated with England for the financial support of the rebels.
