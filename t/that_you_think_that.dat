[...] "Wait and Bleed" [...] is {{about a man who}} keeps having repetitive black and white dreams about laying in a bathtub full of his own blood with his wrists slit. One day, he wakes up and sees that his dream has become a reality. However, he doesn't want to believe it and he tries to fall back asleep again. Chris Fehn said that [...] "Surfacing" [...] "basically encompasses everything. Kind of encompasses the attitude of the band and the attitude of how we feel about life: Don't judge me. Everything <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you know about the world, and about Slipknot, and about your own life, might not be the case.

6000|$|... "It {{is not to}} be {{supposed}} {{but that}} much pain will spring out of this unnecessarily raised question. We must all have foreseen that, and the matter has in no wise gone on worse than we expected; but it will be weak, yes, and wicked also, to abandon the cause and own ourselves wrong, because the inquiry is painful. It is not only ourselves we have to look to; to a certain extent the interest of the church is in our keeping. Should it be found that one after another of those who hold preferment abandoned it whenever it might be attacked, is it not plain that such attacks would be renewed till nothing was left us? and, that if so deserted, the Church of England must fall to the ground altogether? If this be true of many, it is true of one. Were you, accused as you now are, to throw up the wardenship, and to relinquish the preferment which is your property, with the vain object of proving yourself disinterested, you would fail in that object, you would inflict a desperate blow on your brother clergymen, you would encourage every cantankerous dissenter in England to make a similar charge against some source of clerical revenue, and you would do your best to dishearten those who are most anxious to defend you and uphold your position. I can fancy nothing more weak, or more wrong. It is not <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there is any justice in these charges, or that you doubt your own right to the wardenship: you are convinced of your own honesty, and yet would yield to them through cowardice." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{reference}} to the cricket club's not being what it might be, I agree {{with you in the}} main. There are some things to be considered, however, which you have hardly taken into account. The first thing to be avoided is, the slightest appearance of patronage (one of the curses of England). The second thing to be avoided is, the deprival of the men of their just right to manage their own affairs. I would rather have no club at all, than have either of these great mistakes made. The way out of them is this: Call the men together, and explain to them that the club might be larger, richer, and better. Say <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> more of the neighbouring gentlemen could be got to be playing members. That you submit to them {{that it would be better}} to have a captain who could correspond with them, and talk to them, and in some sort manage them; and that, being perfectly acquainted with the game, and having long played it at a great public school, you propose yourself as captain, for the foregoing reasons. That you propose to them to make the subscription of the gentlemen members at least double that of the working men, for no other reason than that the gentlemen can afford it better; but that both classes of members shall have exactly the same right of voting equally in all that concerns the club. Say that you have consulted me upon the matter, and that I am of these opinions, and am ready to become chairman of the club, and to preside at their meetings, and to overlook its business affairs, and to give it five pounds a year, payable at the commencement of each season. Then, having brought them to this point, draw up the club's rules and regulations, amending them where they want amendment.|$|E

50|$|When {{it comes}} to things in his native Finland, he {{believes}} that for paying the television licence fee, he is entitled to seeing Finnish athletes winning Olympic gold medals. Concerning the year 1972 and the Summer Olympics in Munich, he says, “That was when the TV licence fee still worked. Lasse Virén and Pekka Vasala both won.” His favourite programmes on the TV would be provincial relay races in cross-country skiing, if they were broadcast, as he says {{was the case in}} the 1960s. Of the people in power he criticises the Finnish Prime Minister, who has told his fellow countrymen not to give money to beggars. “The very same man who never runs out of tarts and baked potatoes.” Likewise he criticises the Finnish members of parliament and members of the municipal councils, because they have decided that people of his age are exempt from the upcoming reform concerning sewage in the countryside. “You people in politics and in our municipal administration, are you so stupid <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> everyone over 68 years of age is lacking of means?”He does not necessarily reject modern introductions to Finnish life, such as mobile phones, pizza or Thai brides, but views them through his own practical (if antiquated) mindset.|$|E

5000|$|On August 2, 2017, Miller had {{a heated}} {{exchange}} with CNN's Jim Acosta at the White House daily briefing regarding the Trump administration's {{support for the}} RAISE Act to sharply limit legal immigration and favor immigrants with high English proficiency. Acosta said that the proposal was at odds with American traditions concerning immigration and noted that the Statue of Liberty welcomes immigrants to the U.S., invoking verses from Emma Lazarus's The New Colossus. Miller disputed {{the connection between the}} Statute of Liberty and immigration, pointing out that [...] "the poem that you're referring to, that was added later, is not actually a part of the original Statue of Liberty." [...] Miller added that immigration has [...] "ebbed and flowed" [...] throughout American history and asked how many immigrants the U.S. had to accept annually to [...] "meet Jim Acosta's definition of the Statue of Liberty law of the land." [...] Distinguishing between the Statue of Liberty and Lazarus's poem has been a popular talking point among the anti-Semitic alt-right. The Washington Posts Michelle Ye Hee Lee stated that [...] "Neither got it quite right about the Statue of Liberty ... While the poem itself was {{not a part of the}} original statue, it actually was commissioned in 1883 to help raise funds for the pedestal" [...] and [...] "gave another layer of meaning to the statue beyond its abolitionist message." [...] Acosta questioned: [...] "Are we just going to bring in people from Great Britain and Australia?" [...] Miller replied: [...] "I am shocked at your statement <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> only people from Great Britain and Australia would know English. It reveals your cosmopolitan bias to a shocking degree." [...] According to Lee: [...] "Miller has the edge here. English is an official language in dozens of countries other than Great Britain and Australia, and is spoken in roughly 100 countries." [...] In addition, [...] "Miller is correct that English proficiency currently is a requirement for naturalization." [...] Jeff Greenfield, writing in Politico, observed that [...] "cosmopolitan" [...] has historically been used as a code word for Jews. Acosta told Miller that [...] "it sounds like you are trying to engineer the racial and ethnic flow of people into this country." [...] Miller called Acosta's statement [...] "outrageous, insulting, ignorant and foolish", but later apologized for the tone of the exchange.|$|E
