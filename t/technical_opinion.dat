40|$|Building officials, {{professionals}} and designers {{are more and}} more seeking third-party assessment for new and innovative construction materials, products and systems because of the complexity in determining the suitability for use of these innovations. This complexity and today's user expectations make it difficult for one person to undertake the assessment of these products. Such product assessment is better handled by a team of experts possessing the required experience and technical knowledge to define the material and performance issues and the required assessment protocol to establish the suitability for use of the product, including its conformance to the applicable codes and standards. The team of experts needs to be from a number of technical fields to properly define the required performance criteria and test methods for the assessment protocol, as the new products increasingly consist of composite materials and they are often proposed for different applications. The new products may not provide the built-in redundancy that practice have been relying on from traditional materials over the years. The impact of the new products on the long term performance of building assemblies and components may be quite significant given their different physical properties and proposed applications.

The tank was placed in service during the first quarter of 1955, and continued to receive and store waste until July, 1976, when it was removed from service. A liquid level decrease of 0. 75 inches in seven days exceeded the action criterion of 0. 50 inches in a seven day period on June 30, 1976. Occurrence Report (OR) 76 - 91 reported that the tank was considered to be sound as the drywell and lateral radiation readings were stable during the review period. The Richland Operations Office (RL) responded on July 21, 1976 with the following: “RL acknowledges ARHCO’s [Atlantic Richfield Hanford Company] technical assessment of the surveillance data and <b>technical</b> <b>opinion</b> that the subject tank is sound.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade the theme of high speed {{infrastructure}} in Italy has been deeply debated, with different political and <b>technical</b> <b>opinions,</b> which have expanded the time for projects and constructions. As a consequence of this long debate, a redefinition of the whole system, moving from high speed to high speed/high capacity railway system (HS/HC) has been agreed. This new model can be considered more suitable especially for the northern Italy corridor, which is highly populated and densely urbanised. Moreover, while the environmental effects of transportation facilities and of high speed infrastructure are relatively well known in literature since the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedure {{has been applied to}} several study cases, the effects on economical and geographical structure are less studied and so quite often misunderstood or underestimated. According to a demand-side approach, infrastructure investments will follow mobility needs by the economical system, while from a supply-side approach infrastructure are a crucial means of regional growth. This paper presents a study case in northern Italy (the Milan-Verona track, of about 140 km of lenght), and it shows how spatial effect of a transport network can spread off far from the line, determining a new regional hierarchy and new location opportunity in a wide and highly populated area. A comparison has been made between the original high speed model and the most recent high speed-high capacity model. In the two cases the work investigates what is the area where the new infrastructure shows effects, at short and long term. With a spatial interaction model, used to represent residential location in relation to the distribution of workplaces, HS/HC line efficiency by accessibility calculus has been measured, showing several important results. Those results may be of interest even in similar European context where the HS programme is developing. ...|$|R

Although hydrocarbon {{was the center of}} private and state attention in the 1970 's, the ichthyic resources seem to be outstanding today. This article intends to provide explanations for this "change of attitude" in respect to the energetic resources and to evaluate the future possibilities for production. Therefore, the main events since 1970 were identified, according to the information on the matter of hydrocarbon in this area obtained from the following sources: a) the scientific studies and <b>technical</b> <b>opinion</b> of the specialists in respect to the existing potential; b) the U. N. annual documents referring to the Malvinas issue; c) the daily records of the congressional sessions which register the Argentinian and British debates on that issue, and d) the news in the newspapers which inform about the opinion of the actors involved and the activities of the private firms dedicated to the production of oil in the region. The conclusions indicate that in the last decade a series of factors interconnected to relegate hydrocarbon to a clearly secondary role, some of which are: the consequences of the armed conflict; the discouraging and hardly accurate information about the real size of the mines; the enormous costs which were necessary for its extraction; the international market conditions for oil; and the lack of an Anglo-Argentinian political agreement which could {{put an end to the}} uncertainty over the exploitation regime of natural resources in the area.

40|$|Background Prescribing {{errors are}} common and costly. Technology should enable safer prescribing. The two main current methods {{of doing so}} are {{computer}} initiated clinical support software (CDSS) and the user initiated information retrieval (IR) systems. However, despite the near universal availability of computerised prescribing support in the UK, errors continue. Objective To evaluate the experience of UK primary health care professionals using CDSS and to consolidate current <b>technical</b> <b>opinion</b> and literature in this area {{with the aim of}} creating useful hypotheses for guiding future academic investigation and industrial development. Study design The study was a synthesis, drawing together a literature review and views from experts in the field to explore froma qualitative perspective where and how CDSS and IR could be used to improve prescribing safety in primary care. We conducted a literature review, held a workshop to explore issues in practice and had a follow-up expert panelmeeting to confirm the findings. The workshop was recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Participants and setting The study involved primary care practitioners, system developers, information suppliers and academics. Outcomes Although CDSS is incorporated into primary care electronic patient record systems there {{does not appear to be}} an associated marked reduction in prescribing errors. Clinicians are frustrated with current systems, and are concerned these may have a negative impact on patients. There is an unhelpful signal_noise ratio with too many clinically irrelevant alerts and insufficient recognition of the potential downsides of over alerting - possibly making compliance less likely, having a negative impact on the doctor_patient relationship and overloading clinicians. A preferred way forward would be alerts based on quantitative risk assessment of interaction at the level of the preparations being prescribed, rather than theoretical possibilities of interactions between classes of drugs. Conclusion Prescribing errors remain a major source of unnecessary morbidity and mortality and current systems do not appear to have significantly reduced this problem; nor has the extensive literature about how to reduce unnecessary alerts been taken into account. We need a new and more rational basis for the selection and presentation of alerts that would help, not hinder, the clinician's performance...|$|E
40|$|With highly {{accelerated}} {{developments in}} computing and communications technology, society's overall dependence on this equipment {{is becoming increasingly}} acute. In areas such as critical electronic data processing centres and telecommunication hubs, {{one of the main}} protection objectives is to achieve minimum operational disruption, as downtime resulting from a fire condition could lead to huge financial losses. Minimising negative impact on an organization and the need for a sound basis in the decision making process are the fundamental reasons why companies implement fire risk management for their essential information technology systems. For many years a key element used to protect these critical assets was the installation of a fixed Halon 1301 gas extinguishing system. Often, the mere presence of a computer was sufficient justification to install such a system and little thought was given to any systematic fire risk assessment of the installation. This led to the use of Halon 1301 where other fire extinguishing systems and protection techniques could have been applied with equal effectiveness and at comparable costs. The cessation of production of halon {{as a result of the}} Montreal Protocol gave fresh impetus to the development of suitable alternative fire extinguishing agents. It also offered fire protection engineers an opportunity to re-evaluate existing loss control techniques and to examine alternative fire protection strategies. However, it is argued in this study, that an appropriate level of automatic fire protection can only be determined by the use of a suitable quantitative risk assessment and a number of such methodologies are critically examined. There are a significant number of contributing factors that must be considered when deciding which fire suppression system to select for a new installation or whether to retrofit fire suppression on a legacy platform. Consequently, it is necessary to develop a methodology to quantify any fire suppression technology by its life cycle cost and then to apply informed <b>technical</b> <b>opinion</b> into this system. The results of this assessment procedure offer a number of possible fire engineering solutions including a quite diverse range of automatic fire extinguishing techniques and these are discussed and evaluated in detail. Inevitably, a high proportion of such critical risks will require the installation of an automatic fire suppression system. The main halocarbon and inert replacement extinguishing agents are therefore critically compared and contrasted for their suitability in protecting these facilities. A complete review of these extinguishing agents was conducted which focused on suppression mechanisms; quantification of their performance and qualities; interaction with a fire and potential damage to electrical equipment from the release of a given agent. It is shown that all the post-halon extinguishing agents are deficient in some important areas. Major issues such as the formation of thermal decomposition products, the protection of continuously energized electrical circuits and the adequacy of the specified design and extinguishing concentrations have generally not been adequately addressed. Unfortunately, some of these issues are not even resolved in the current gaseous fire extinguishing standards which offer minimal advice from either a design or installation standpoint. This study demonstrates that existing international design standards are deficient in some fundamental areas and that, in a number of circumstances, systems installed to these standards are inadequate to fully protect the hazard in question. A number of recommendations are presented to address some of these deficiencies. Finally, a semi-quantitative risk assessment methodology for the selection of suitable extinguishing agents is proposed. Initially, this attempts to synthesize the results derived from the critical extinguishing agent review and then applies an application weighting factor based on expert consensus to provide a final score for a particular suppression mechanisms suitability to protect a given application...|$|E

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityThis study of decision making in the modern Supreme Court proceeds from {{the development of a}} theoretical framework to analysis of the achievements of Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., during more than twenty years on the Court. A preliminary consideration of relationships between individual justices, blocs, and the Court as a whole leads to the formulation of a framework for analysis that guides the substantive investigation. The individual justice is the building block of this framework. Norms associated with the role of Supreme Court justice shape the institutional setting, but the individual remains essentially free to vote in accordance with his policy preferences and individual role orientation. In order to shape public policy through an opinion of the Court, however, the individual justice must gain majority support. Supreme Court opinions, therefore, are shaped by a complex process involving both individual choice and group interaction. Application of this framework to Brennan's thirteen years on the Warren Court and {{the early years of the}} Burger Court reveals shifts in Brennan's position within the Court as the Court itself changed with each new appointment. Between 1956 and 1962, Brennan's contributions tended to take the form of moderatelyworded, often <b>technical,</b> <b>opinions</b> of the Court when a majority of the justices supported civil liberties claims and cautious dissents when they did not. Between 1962 and 1969, he became the central figure on a Court increasingly committed to the libertarian, yet pragmatic, positions he favored. Voting with the majority in more than 96 percent of the Court's decisions, he wrote many of the most influential opinions of an era that was truly the heyday of Warren and Brennan. After 1969, he became increasingly isolated from the conservative mainstream of the Burger Court. Yet, he remained on the bench, vigorously protesting decisions which he believed undermined the achievements of the Warren Court. At the political system level, the broad outlines of change in the Court's direction during Brennan's tenure may be traced ultimately to the electoral arena. Still, the norm of individual responsibility propounded by justices like Brennan has enabled the modern Court to perform its function as guardian of lasting constitutional values...|$|R
