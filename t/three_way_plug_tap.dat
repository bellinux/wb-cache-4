5000|$|Intermediate tap, second <b>tap,</b> or <b>plug</b> tap: [...] The tap {{illustrated}} {{in the middle of}} the image has tapered cutting edges, which assist in aligning and starting the tap into an untapped hole. The number of tapered threads typically ranges from 3 to 5. <b>Plug</b> <b>taps</b> are the most commonly used type of tap. In the US, they are commonly known as <b>plug</b> <b>taps,</b> whereas in Australia and Britain they are commonly known as second taps.|$|R
50|$|With soft or average {{hardness}} materials, such as plastic, aluminum or mild steel, {{the common}} practice {{is to use}} an intermediate (<b>plug)</b> <b>tap</b> to cut the threads. If the threads are to extend {{to the bottom of}} a blind hole, the intermediate (<b>plug)</b> <b>tap</b> will be used to cut threads until the point of the tap reaches bottom, after which a bottoming tap will be used to finish the hole. Frequent ejection of the chips must be made in such an operation to avoid jamming and possibly breaking the tap. With hard materials, the machinist may start with a taper tap, whose less severe diameter transition reduces the amount of torque required to cut the threads. If threads are to be cut to the bottom of a blind hole, the taper tap will be followed by an intermediate (<b>plug)</b> <b>tap</b> and then a bottoming tap to finish the operation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} type of power driven tap is the [...] "spiral point" [...] <b>plug</b> <b>tap,</b> whose cutting edges are {{angularly}} displaced relative to the tap centerline. This feature causes the tap to continuously break the chip and eject it forward into the hole, preventing crowding. Spiral point taps are usually used in holes that go {{all the way through the}} material, so that the chips can escape. Another version of the spiral point <b>plug</b> <b>tap</b> is the spiral flute tap, whose flutes resemble those of a twist drill. Spiral flute taps are widely used in high speed, automatic tapping operations due to their ability to work well in blind holes.|$|R
50|$|Taper tap: The small tap {{illustrated}} at {{the bottom}} of the image is similar to an intermediate tap but has a more pronounced taper to the cutting edges. This feature gives the taper tap a very gradual cutting action that is less aggressive than that of the <b>plug</b> <b>tap.</b> The number of tapered threads typically ranges from 8 to 10. A taper tap is most often used when the material to be tapped is difficult to work (e.g., alloy steel) or the tap is of a very small diameter and thus prone to breakage.|$|R
5000|$|Bottoming <b>tap</b> or <b>plug</b> tap: [...] The tap {{illustrated}} {{in the top of}} the image has a continuous cutting edge with almost no taper â€” between 1 and 1.5 threads of taper is typical. [...] This feature enables a bottoming tap to cut threads to the bottom of a blind hole. A bottoming tap is usually used to cut threads in a hole that has already been partially threaded using one of the more tapered types of tap; the tapered end ("tap chamfer") of a bottoming tap is too short to successfully start into an unthreaded hole. In the US, they are commonly known as bottoming taps, but in Australia and Britain they are also known as <b>plug</b> <b>taps.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> Independent School District {{was formed}} in May 1945 by the {{consolidation}} of Goodland Consolidated Independent School District No. 7, Watson Independent School District No. 10, and Wilson Independent County Line School District No. 14. <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> School was built on a 20 acre parcel of land north of Maple. Over the years, several smaller districts - including Stegall (1946) and Bula (1975) - consolidated with <b>Three</b> <b>Way.</b> By the 1994-1995 school year, the district enrolled 127 students. That figure had fallen to 83 by 2001. Faced with declining enrollment and lower funding from the state, <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> administrators decided that the district would have to consolidate with another larger school district {{by the start of}} the next school year. Three neighboring districts - Morton, Muleshoe, and Sudan - were considered for consolidation. A questionnaire was sent to <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> ISD parents and registered voters to see which of the candidate districts was most favored. Sudan ISD was selected by approximately 57 percent of <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> voters and 59 percent of <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> parents. Both school boards approved the decision and the issue was put to a vote on February 2, 2002. In the election, Sudan ISD voters supported consolidation by a 190-1 margin. Of the 80 votes cast by <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> ISD residents, 54 supported the measure with 26 opposed. The merger of <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> ISD with Sudan became official on July 1, 2002.|$|R
