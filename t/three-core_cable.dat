40|$|Introduction. The {{moral and}} {{physical}} deterioration of medium voltage power cables with phase and zone paper-impregnated insulation requires implementation of quality systems and reliable nondestructive electric diagnostic. Informative {{indicator of the}} insulation is the time decay curve of the charging current. It reflects the processes of accumulation of space charges (absorption). The measurements are carried out the 15 th since the second direct voltage supply, then – on the 30 th and the second on the 60 th second. The ratio of the parameters measured in these times gives the dimensionless criteria – absorption coefficients. Three measurements are made at different times, provide a more complete picture {{of the state of}} insulation than the measurement of the value of steady leakage (conduction-through), adopted in conventional prevention trials. Purpose. Research and testing methods of diagnostics of power cables with paper-impregnated insulation by absorption and phase characteristics of the belt insulation based on the total measurements. Methodology. A procedure for determining the individual characteristics of phase and zone paper-impregnated insulation based realized {{on the use of the}} equivalent circuit of a <b>three-core</b> <b>cable</b> in the metal shell and solved of an over determined system of linear algebraic equations by least squares. Results. The proposed method allows determining the absorption characteristics of the individual phase and zone insulation medium voltage power cables in the overall metal shell at a direct voltage. Individual characteristics reflect the characteristics of cables and allow a greater degree to assess the degree of aging of each of the components of paper-impregnated insulation. Originality. Regardless of the cable connection diagrams probing electric field grabs as the phase, and zone insulation. The cumulative nature of the measurement leads to the fact that the differences in the properties of insulation components are smoothed: the aggregate results of the measurements do not differ for the different schemes of the same type. The individual characteristics of isolation, defined on the basis of the proposed method are more differences than total, indicating that non-symmetrical modes of operation of the cable. Practical value. The values of individual characteristics power cables 6 kV are 3 times more total, because of what their direct measurement may be a problem. The total resistance of several insulation spaces connected in parallel, behind the individual. Smaller values of insulation resistance are measured more easily, especially on short samples cables...|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} {{submarine}} power cables is {{the transport of}} electric current at high voltage. The electric core is a concentric assembly of inner conductor, electric insulation and protective layers. The conductor is made from copper or aluminum wires, the latter material having a small but increasing market share. Conductor sizes ≤ 1200 are most common, but sizes ≥ 2400 mm2 have been made occasionally. For voltages ≥ 12 kV the conductors are round. Three different types of electric insulation around the conductor are mainly used today.Cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) is used up to 420 kV system voltage. It is produced by extrusion in insulation thickness of up to about 30 mm. 36 kV class cables have only 5.5 - 8 mm insulation thickness. Certain formulations of XLPE insulation {{can also be used}} for DC.Low-pressure oil-filled cables have an insulation lapped from paper strips. The entire cable core is impregnated with a low-viscosity insulation fluid (mineral oil or synthetic). A central oil channel in the conductor facilitates oil flow when the cable gets warm. Rarely used in submarine cables due to oil pollution risk at cable damage. Is used up to 525 kV.Mass-impregnated cables have also a paper-lapped insulation but the impregnation compound is highly viscous and does not exit when the cable is damaged. MI insulation can be used for massive HVDC cables up to 525 kV. Cables ≥ 52 kV are equipped with an extruded lead sheath to prevent water intrusion. No other materials have been accepted so far. The lead alloy is extruded onto the insulation in long lengths (over 50 km is possible). In this stage the product is called cable core. In single-core cables the core is surrounded by a concentric armoring. In <b>three-core</b> <b>cables,</b> three cable cores are laid-up in a spiral configuration before the armoring is applied.The armouring consists most often of steel wires, soaked in bitumen for corrosion protection. Since the alternating magnetic field in ac cables causes losses in the armoring those cables are sometimes equipped with non-magnetic metallic materials (stainless steel, copper, brass). Modern <b>three-core</b> <b>cables,</b> e.g. for the interconnection of offshore wind turbines) carry often optical fibers for data transmission or temperature measurement.|$|R

40|$|The {{propagation}} {{modes of}} travelling wave in a threecore power cable (XLPE or PILC) with common earth screen can be uncoupled into three modes: one shield to phase (SP) mode and two phase to phase (PP) modes. A generic model approach is applied {{in this paper}} to estimate the transmission line parameters of <b>three-core</b> <b>cables</b> with common earth screen, which includes the effect of different layers on series impedance and admittance. The characteristic impedance, the propagation velocity and the attenuation for SP and PP modes of two cable types, PILC and XLPE are modeled and compared with test results. Calculated parameters match within 5 % for the characteristic impedances of different modes and 5 % for the velocity for the PILC cable. Larger deviations occurred for XLPE cable, due to difficulties in appropriate modeling the semiconducting insulation screens around each conductor. The attenuation for both PILC and XLPE is hard to predict because data on complex permittivity, being the dominant factor, is hardly known...|$|R

40|$|On-line Partial Discharge (PD) {{detection}} and location systems for medium-voltage cables are at present being introduced in Dutch utilities and worldwide. The technical challenges now {{move from the}} development of the diagnostic technique itself to efficient implementation on alarge scale. In this paper we discuss several implementation related challenges and will propose adequate solutions. These challenges include robust algorithms to determine time of arrivals of distorted PD waveforms, signal propagation along cable types and configurations as three-core and cross bonded cables, and effect of ring main units or substations on signal propagation. Algorithms based on signal energy and on phase angle in frequency domain are preferred above e. g. threshold detection to determine PD arrival times. By introducing effective dielectric properties, cable parameters for accurate fault location as characteristic impedance and propagation velocity can be estimated also if data on semiconducting layers are unavailable. Models are proposed for cross-bonded connections and for <b>three-core</b> <b>cables</b> with common earth screen.

40|$|Cable-series {{impedance}} modeling {{is widely}} applied in electromagnetic transients simulations and power-loss calculations. The calculations are usually {{performed in a}} 2 -D frame using the finite-element method or alternative approaches, such as MoM-SO, thereby losing the 3 -D effects imposed by twisting wire screens and armors. One {{of the implications of}} using 2 -D modeling for three-core and closely packed single-core cables is that currents will always circulate among the individual wires of each wire screen or armor. However, in the case of twisted screens/armors where the wires are insulated from each other, such current circulation will in reality not exist. As a result, the calculated impedances become incorrect as well as the induced currents and losses on individual conductors. A procedure is introduced for preventing such false current circulations in a 2 -D calculation frame by simple manipulation of the system impedance matrix. The approach is demonstrated for the modeling of single-core and <b>three-core</b> <b>cables,</b> with and without external armor. It is shown that the representation of the wire screen/armor armor with respect to current circulations can substantially influence the calculated result, both for the 50 / 60 Hz impedance and the cable transient behavior. The use of tubular screen representations is also investigate...|$|R

40|$|Online partial {{discharge}} (PD) detection and location in cable systems {{is a valuable}} tool for the estimation of {{the condition of the}} system.

40|$|Abstract: In {{power cables}} fast {{transient}} signals arise because of partial discharges. These signals propagate {{to the cable}} ends {{where they can be}} detected for diagnostic purposes. To enable optimal detection sensitivity and to judge their severity the propagation parameters Zc (characteristic impedance) and g (propagation coefficient) need to be known. A <b>three-core</b> power <b>cable</b> with a single metallic earth screen around the assembly of the cores has multiple, coupled propagation modes with corresponding characteristic impedances and propagation coefficients. This paper presents a practical method to measure and analyse the cable parameters. The propagation modes are decoupled into a modal solution. The modal solution is interpreted in terms of convenient propagation modes: a shield-to-phase (SP) propagation mode between conductors and earth screen and two identical phase-to-phase (PP) modes between conductors. The measurement method, based on a pulse response measurement, to determine all transmission line parameters of the SP and PP modes is proposed and tested on a cable sample. The model is validated by predicting the time, shape and amplitude of multiple reflections in all modes resulting from an injected pulse. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} {{of the high}} frequency signal propagating along underground power cables is part of many monitoring techniques, e. g. partial discharge (PD) based diagnostics. On one hand, higher frequency corresponds to better spatial resolution, which means more accurate PD location. On the other hand, signal attenuation increases with frequency. Apart from the signal itself, noise level and detection equipment {{also play a role}} in the signal detection process. This paper focuses on the detection limitation of high frequency components in PD signals travelling along an underground power cable considering effects of signal attenuation, noise level and applied equipment. The attenuation coefficient is based on measurements from 10 kV <b>three-core</b> XLPE <b>cables.</b> Though the attenuation coefficients for other types of cables differ, the measured value for this particular cable provides a practical parameter value, and it can be altered to match other cable types. The detected analog signal is digitized through an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and may be averaged before being digitally stored. In addition, an amplifier and/or filter can be applied before the analog to digital (AD) conversion. The vertical resolution and the vertical sensitivity of the ADC are crucial for signal detection. Effect of noise is considered in this paper by analyzing Gaussian noise and typical noise characteristics obtained from field measured. Sinusoidal wave and Gaussian pulse shapes are applied as input signals for the cable. Firstly, the relationship between maximum cable length and detectable frequency components for a specific set of detection equipment conditions is analyzed without averaging. This is the limitation from ADC. Secondly, the merits and limits of averaging are studied. The required averaging time for different frequencies as a function of PD signal propagation length is studied. Finally, the effect of averaging and analog filtering is demonstrated with test measurements...|$|R
