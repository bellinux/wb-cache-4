25|$|At 10:12:03, JP550 {{called the}} Zagreb middle-sector {{controller}} to inform {{them that the}} aircraft was out of flight level 310. The last instructions given by Erjavec to JP550 were to call the upper-sector controller on 134.45MHz and to stop squawking the assigned squawk code. By instructing JP550 <b>to</b> <b>squawk</b> Standby, Erjavec simply released a code allocated for the middle sector. The data tag for the DC-9 would now disappear from his screen and the aircraft would become merely a point among many others. If everything about this handover had been normal, the DC-9 would {{have been given a}} new code on initial contact with the upper sector controller and would have been positively identified on the upper sector screen with its flight number and altitude readout. But this had not been a normal handover because of the ill-handled co-ordination for the climb. Also, Tasić was busy with other traffic and JP550 did not immediately contact the upper-sector controller. This could have been because the frequency was busy, but the pilots might also have delayed the call for some unknown reason.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} to note, {{that there is no}} official means of navigation for IR or VR routes. A VR route may be flown visually, and an IR route may be flown completely heads down (although this is rarely the case). Although ATC provides deconfliction for IR Routes, VR routes are flown completely independent of external separation. Since VFR traffic does not legally have <b>to</b> be <b>squawking,</b> this provides for a serious hazard to navigation. The FAA claims the military maximizes use of IR routes for this purpose, however the vast majority of military training flights on MTRs are on VR routes.|$|R
50|$|Squawk Box is a {{business}} news television program that airs at breakfast time on the CNBC network. The program is currently co-hosted by Joe Kernen, Rebecca Quick, and Andrew Ross Sorkin. Since debuting in 1995, the show has spawned a number of versions across CNBC's international channels, many of which employ a similar format. The program title originates from a term used in investment banks and stock brokerages for a permanent voice circuit or intercom used to communicate stock deals or sales priorities; it also may refer <b>to</b> the <b>squawk</b> of a bird, like a peacock, which is the logo of CNBC.|$|R

5000|$|Squawk {{codes are}} four-digit octal numbers; the dials on a {{transponder}} read {{from zero to}} seven, inclusive. Thus the lowest possible squawk is 0000 and the highest is 7777. Four octal digits can represent up to 4096 different codes, which is why such transponders are often called [...] "4096 code transponders." [...] Care must be taken not <b>to</b> <b>squawk</b> any emergency code during a code change. For example, when changing from 1200 to 6501 (an example of an assigned air traffic control squawk), one might turn the second wheel to a 5 (thus 1500), and then rotate the first wheel backwards in the sequence 1-0-7-6 to get to 6. This would momentarily cause the transponder <b>to</b> <b>squawk</b> the code 7500, which is an emergency code signalling to ATC that the aircraft has been hijacked, causing an unnecessary false alarm situation. However, while {{it is important to}} not select an emergency code by mistake, pilots are also instructed to avoid setting the transponder in [...] "standby mode" [...] as a means of avoiding accidental selection, as it causes the loss of target information by ATC. Modern digital transponders allow the direct selection of squawk codes, without having to cycle past other numbers.|$|E

In 1997, Namtchylak was horrifically attacked by Tuvinian racketeers which left her {{in a coma for}} two weeks. Again, sources regarding this contradict - others maintain that she underwent surgery for a severe malignant brain tumor; regardless, 1997 marked an appreciable change in her life. Since then, she has been resident in exile in Vienna, and has also recorded more prolifically as a solo artist - although she has released over thirty albums in the past twenty years, only seven have been entirely solo.|$|R

40|$|Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) is a {{comprehensive}} capability. An ISHM system must detect anomalies, identify causes of such anomalies, predict future anomalies, help identify consequences of anomalies for example, suggested mitigation steps. The system should also provide users with appropriate navigation tools to facilitate {{the flow of information}} {{into and out of the}} ISHM system. Central to the ability of the ISHM to detect anomalies is a clearly defined catalog of anomalies. Further, this lexicon of anomalies must be organized in ways that make it accessible to a suite of tools used to manage the data, information and knowledge (DIaK) associated with a system. In particular, it is critical to ensure that there is optimal mapping between target anomalies and the algorithms associated with their detection. During the early development of our ISHM architecture and approach, it became clear that a lexicon of anomalies would be important to the development of critical anomaly detection algorithms. In our work in the rocket engine test environment at John C. Stennis Space Center, we have access to a repository of discrepancy reports (DRs) that are generated in response <b>to</b> <b>squawks</b> identified during post-test data analysis. The DR is the tool used to document anomalies and the methods used to resolve the issue. These DRs have been generated for many different tests and for all test stands. The result is that they represent {{a comprehensive}} summary of the anomalies associated with rocket engine testing. Fig. 1 illustrates some of the data that can be extracted from a DR. Such information includes affected transducer channels, narrative description of the observed anomaly, and the steps used to correct the problem. The primary goal of the anomaly lexicon development efforts we have undertaken is to create a lexicon that could be used in support of an associated health assessment database system (HADS) co-development effort. There are a number of significant byproducts of the anomaly lexicon compilation effort. For example, (1) Allows determination of the frequency distribution of anomalies to help identify those with the potential for high return on investment if included in automated detection as part of an ISHM system, (2) Availability of a regular lexicon could provide the base anomaly name choices to help maintain consistency in the DR collection process, and (3) Although developed for the rocket engine test environment, most of the anomalies are not specific to rocket testing, and thus can be reused in other applications...|$|R

The calling song is composed of quiet parts, which are very similar <b>to</b> the disturbance <b>squawk,</b> and loud parts, which are amplitude- and rate-modulated. The role of the tensor muscle acting on the tymbal frame in modulating the sound pulse amplitude was investigated. We demonstrate by tensor nerve recordings, by mechanical mimicking of the tensor muscle action and by electrical stimulation of the tensor nerve, that the contraction of the tensor muscle is responsible for (a) initiating sound production and (b) modulating the sound pulse amplitude. These results allow us to construct a model which suggests that the tensor shifts the tymbal into a mechanical working range that enables sound production and modulation of the sound pulse amplitude...|$|R
