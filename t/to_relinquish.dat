5|$|An {{enduring}} theme {{during and}} after the oil boom has been a reluctance among Texans <b>to</b> <b>relinquish</b> their identity and a stubbornness in maintaining their cultural heritage in the face of drastic changes to the state brought by the sudden wealth. Despite its growth and industrialization, Texas culture in the mid-20th century remained distinct from the other industrial centers of the nation.|$|E

According to historian George Sanford, around 1920 Piłsudski came to realize the infeasibility of this version of his Intermarium project.|$|E

30|$|It {{seems obvious}} that complex {{clinical}} diseases {{could be better}} investigated and subsequently more effectively treated if personnel who are authorized to access data and physical specimens would be expanded.

5|$|A liberal, Anspach {{feared the}} {{weakness}} and rigidity {{of the government}} and therefore gave the work of covering the river to a private British company, the Belgian Public Works Company (the English name was used), which was created for the task.

50|$|Economic {{integration}} in Africa is being hampered, however, by the similar structure of economies (minerals and agriculture), poor economic diversification and {{low levels of}} intraregional trade: just 12% of total African trade, compared to about 55% in Asia and 70% in Europe. However, ‘the most formidable obstacle of all to regional integration Africa is probably the resistance of individual governments <b>to</b> <b>relinquishing</b> any national sovereignty’. ‘The increasingly urgent requirement for Africa to engage in a unified manner {{in a world that is}} increasingly characterized by economic blocs and large emerging economic powers’.|$|R

Normal racing resumed on lap four, with Carlos Sainz Jr. falling back from fifth to his starting position in seventh place after being passed by Nasr and Daniel Ricciardo. Nasr also lost track position after being ordered by his team <b>to</b> <b>relinquish</b> a position for overtaking while still under safety car conditions.|$|E

After his daughter's death he becomes more sincere in his religious thoughts and starts to read the Bible to Tom. He plans on finally taking action against slavery by freeing his slaves, but his good intentions ultimately come to nothing.|$|E
5|$|Braille {{had always}} been a sickly child, and his {{condition}} worsened in adulthood.
