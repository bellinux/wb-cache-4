5|$|All the WindSeekers have {{speakers}} {{mounted to}} the inside of the gondola structure. They play 18 different tracks, among which are Hedwig's theme from the Harry Potter films, the theme songs from E.T., , and Superman, and songs from Flight of the Valkyries. At Cedar Point and Kings Island, the WindSeeker sign changes colors during night operation. At Cedar Point, as the gondola makes its way up the tower, the LED lights at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> go out, making the tower invisible, though the LED lights on the gondola remains lit. When the gondola comes back down, the lights at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> come on again. At Canada's Wonderland, the LED lights at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> remain on throughout the cycle, keeping the tower visible at all times.|$|E
5|$|The tower has a {{composite}} steel and concrete frame featuring a pre-stressed, reinforced slip-form concrete core, which is stiffened by an outrigger truss at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> {{and at the}} various side setbacks.|$|E
5|$|A train may {{occasionally}} {{experience a}} rollback following a launch. A rollback {{occurs when the}} train fails to make it over the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> and descends back down the side it was launched. Kingda Ka includes retractable magnetic brakes on its launch track to prevent a train from rolling back into the loading station.|$|E

The last torchbearer, diver He Chong lit up the cauldron, after igniting the traditional Chinese firecrackers whose flare shot up to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> where the cauldron was held.|$|E
5|$|On {{very rare}} occasions, a {{combination}} of the weight distribution of the train, the force of the launch, and the wind can stall a train on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> When this happens, a mechanic takes the elevator to the top and pushes the train down the hill.|$|E
5|$|With {{construction}} finally proceeding once more, the Palace Hotel {{closed in}} June 1986. In April 1987, while the tower {{was still under}} construction, five men were arrested after illegally entering the site and parachuting from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> {{in the early hours}} of the morning.|$|E

50|$|The brick {{exterior}} {{is heavily}} decorated with variations of dimension stone, and framings for all windows and doors. Across the roof edges {{are a large}} number of dormers, each with their own crow-stepped gable.

5|$|On 7 September 1909 two {{visitors}} were left stranded at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> {{as the final}} lift car of the night descended without them. The woman and twelve-year-old child were not noticed during {{the final round of}} inspection and so, without a way to communicate with anyone on the ground, they spent the night on the tower until 10am the following morning. They did not appear too concerned by the ordeal and left without giving their names to officials.|$|E
5|$|The account ledgers of Tallinn {{city council}} contain entries about the Kõpu {{lighthouse}} from 1507 to 1533, showing money {{was spent on}} the beacon of Hiiumaa from 13 May 1514 until 12 October 1532. The amounts show {{the majority of the}} work took place from 1514 to 1519; later there are only a couple of bigger expenditures on the beacon. A fire was first lit in the autumn of 1531; it was simply a bonfire on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b>|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1996, One Times Square's first {{electronic}} billboards were installed, such as, a Cup Noodles billboard with steam effects {{was added}} {{to the front of the}} tower, later accompanied by an animated Budweiser sign. In October, a new 55-foot video screen sponsored by ITT Corporation was introduced to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> which would feature video advertisements and community service announcements. In December 1996, a new Panasonic display operated by NBC known as Astrovision was introduced as a replacement for Sony's Jumbotron at the base of the tower.|$|E
50|$|It was rebuilt in 1540 {{to replace}} the old manor house. The {{architect}} appears to be Dominique Bachelor. During the Revolution, in 1794, the sculptures were smashed and <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> destroyed. It was restored, with alterations, in 1887.|$|R

50|$|The {{imposing}} brick Castello Estense sited in <b>the</b> very centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town is iconic <b>of</b> Ferrara. <b>The</b> castle, {{erected in}} 1385, {{is surrounded by}} a moat, with four massive bastions. The pavilions on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> date from <b>the</b> 16th-century refurbishment.|$|R
5|$|In 1931 an unexplained fire {{destroyed}} much of {{the interior}} of the house, which had been turned into a cemetery chapel. The local fire brigade managed to stop the fire reaching the wooden stairs to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> Prebendary F. E. Murphy, the rector of Walcot, established an appeal for funds of £300 for the restoration. By 1954 the stairs up the tower had become unsafe and a further appeal for public funds for the restoration was started. In 1970 the Church Commissioners declared the chapel redundant and plans drawn up by the new owners, Dr & Mrs Hilliard, to renovate the tower and create two flats. The Beckford Tower Trust and the museum were established in 1977.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, local artists also {{supplemented}} the figure with items such as radishes, pretzels, laurel wreaths and foaming beer steins. The symbol diversely appears in numerous places such as on manhole covers, beer steins and the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> of the town hall. While the symbol as a man through being a monk was previously clear, its gender has become ambiguous since being designated the Kindl. One interpretation is that it is simply genderless, however in the 1920s a female inclination became apparent, and portrayals in person are to this day by young women.|$|E
5|$|Some {{viewers have}} presumed that the Pennsylvania Paper & Supply Company's tower, a {{downtown}} Scranton landmark which appears in video footage shot by cast member John Krasinski for the show's opening credits, is the Dunder Mifflin office. The real company, which also sells paper and office supplies, has welcomed the exposure (and increase in business) {{and has a}} ground-floor showroom where it sells both its products and T-shirts with the tower. It plans to add a Dunder Mifflin logo to the circular insets near the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> Mifflin Avenue ends adjacent to the Penn Paper & Supply building.|$|E
50|$|Recommendations for {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge include installing elevators {{to provide access}} to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> as a lookout.

5|$|The 1982 work-ins {{took place}} from 24 July to 1 August and 21 August to 29 August. The work planned {{included}} {{the completion of}} the brickwork at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> installation of the Elm curb, a start on the construction of the new cap, installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows. The cap frame was constructed, incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused. The cap frame was completed in autumn 1982. It had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the windshaft into position.|$|E
5|$|As Cayman-Global attacks Eurocorp's New York HQ, Kilo and Lily head towards Denham's {{office to}} prevent him from {{activating}} the kill switch on their DART chips. Kilo has to fight off both Eurocorp and Cayman-Global forces, as well as several EuroCorp agents. At the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> he is forced to fight Merit and two other agents, who are under Denham's orders to kill him. Kilo defeats the agents, and overpowers and kills Merit. Kilo then heads towards Denham's office but finds Denham has activated his kill switch, which starts to affect Kilo's movements. Weakened, Kilo confronts Denham, who justifies abducting him as a child. Kilo manages to fight against the kill-switch order and corners Denham, who lets himself fall over a ledge to his death. As the game ends, Eurocorp lies in ruins and Lily gives Kilo a pistol, telling him that he is free from anyone's control.|$|E

5|$|One World Trade Center's steel {{structure}} topped {{out at the}} nominal 104th floor, with a total height of , in August 2012. The tower's antenna was then shipped from Quebec to New York in November 2012, and {{the first section of}} the antenna was hoisted to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> on December 12, 2012, and was installed on January 15, 2013. By March 2013, two sections of the antenna had been installed. The spire's completion was scheduled for April 29, 2013, but bad weather delayed the delivery of the final pieces. On May 10, 2013, the final piece of the spire was lifted to the top of One World Trade Center, bringing the tower to its full height of , and making it the fourth-tallest building in the world. In subsequent months, the exterior elevator shaft was removed; the podium glass, interior decorations, and other finishings were being installed; and installation of concrete flooring and steel fittings was completed.|$|E
5|$|Resonance of Fate {{takes place}} on Earth in the distant future. The levels of {{pollution}} in the atmosphere trigger massive environmental changes, making the world hostile to human life. On the brink of extinction, humanity creates Basel, a giant air purification module controlled by the Zenith System. As conditions worsened in the land surrounding Basel, the remnants of humanity gathered around it and built a great city {{at the base of}} Zenith's tower. While Basel and the Zenith System control the surrounding environment to make it habitable for humans, it also controls the human population: each person has their social status determined at birth, and their exact lifespan is controlled through quartz crystals programmed by Zenith. Basel evolves for countless years into a class-driven society, the populace forgets everything about Basel's past: those at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> are the city's leaders, dubbed Cardinals, and indoctrinate the people into a religion deifying the Zenith System.|$|E
5|$|St Mary's {{is built}} of ashlar buff and red {{sandstone}} quarried locally at Alderley Edge, and {{the roof is}} of Kerridge stone slates. Its plan consists of a tower at the west end, a four-bay nave with north and south aisles, a chancel with a vestry to its north, and a south porch. Over the north aisle is a dormer window. The tower has diagonal buttresses. Its west door has 14th-century mouldings and above the door is a three-light window. The stage above this contains ringers' windows on {{the north and west}} faces and a diamond-shaped clock on the south face. Above these the belfry windows on all faces have two lights. The <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> is embattled and contains the bases of eight pinnacles. Below the parapet is a string course with large grotesque gargoyles. At the west end of the nave roof is a bellcote. The Stanley pew projects to the east of the south porch. In the porch are grooves which were cut where arrows were sharpened.|$|E
