5|$|In the process, Highway62 was {{truncated}} {{at the new}} bypass; the removed {{section was}} redesignated Highway148, giving it the same number as the route in Quebec that it served <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Trans-Canada Highway.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} to the Northwestern Highway was again proposed in 1966 <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> proposed I-275 extension. The I-275 project was then cancelled in 1977. The section of Northwestern Highway under state control between the West Bloomfield Township–Farmington Hills border into Southfield was numbered M-4 in 1979.|$|E

5|$|On 23 September 1868 {{the small}} Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway (A) was opened.

5|$|Also in Brooklyn, the BMT Canarsie Line {{would gain}} an eastern branch to Spring Creek, serving Starrett City (now Spring Creek Towers). The {{mainline}} {{would also be}} lengthened from its southern terminus at Rockaway Parkway to a new terminus in Midwood and Flatlands near the existing Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College IRT station. The reroute would not use the existing segment between New Lots Avenue and Rockaway Parkway. Later plans suggested extending the line as far west as McDonald Avenue near the Avenue I station of the IND Culver Line or possibly to New Utrecht Avenue to the New Utrecht Avenue/62nd Street station, creating crosstown service through central Brooklyn. It was also proposed to relocate the Canarsie Line west of its current right-of-way south of Broadway Junction, along the parallel LIRR Bay Ridge Branch (currently a freight-only branch) or in the median of the proposed Queens Interboro Expressway and Cross Brooklyn Expressway, {{which would have been}} built along both the LIRR branch and Linden Boulevard. The re-alignment would have facilitated both extensions. The current Bushwick Avenue, Broadway Junction and Atlantic Avenue stations would have been consolidated into one station on the Bay Ridge Line, new Sutter Avenue and Livonia Avenue stations would have been built, and the East 105th Street station would be replaced with a station at Rockaway Avenue on the Bay Ridge Line. Additional stations would have been built at Remsen Avenue, Ralph Avenue, Utica Avenue <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Utica Avenue Line, Nostrand Avenue <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Nostrand Avenue Line, Avenue H <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Brighton Line, and McDonald Avenue to connect to the Culver Line before terminating at New Utrecht Avenue.|$|E

5|$|Even {{following}} the conversion to cylindrical smokeboxes, {{it was still}} possible to distinguish some non-streamliners from ex-streamliners. On the former (Nos. 46230-46234 and 46249-46252, but not 46253-46257) the running plates veered downwards at right angles <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> buffer beam {{in the style of}} the Princess Royal Class. The ex-streamliners did not have any such connection, except No.46242 City of Glasgow which was rebuilt in 1952 following a serious collision.|$|E
5|$|The Chesham {{branch is}} a {{single-track}} railway branch line in Buckinghamshire, England, {{owned and operated}} by the London Underground. It runs from a junction at Chalfont & Latimer station on the Metropolitan line for 3.89miles (6.26km) northwest to Chesham. The line was built as part of Edward Watkin's scheme to turn his Metropolitan Railway (MR) into a direct rail route between London and Manchester, and it was envisaged initially that a station outside Chesham would be an intermediate stop on a through route running north <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> London and North Western Railway (LNWR). Deteriorating relations between the MR and LNWR led to the MR instead expanding to the northwest via Aylesbury, and the scheme <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> LNWR was abandoned. By this time much of the land needed for the section of line as far as Chesham had been bought. As Chesham was at the time the only significant town near the MR's new route, it was decided to build the route only as far as Chesham, and to complete the connection with the LNWR at a future date if it proved desirable. Local residents were unhappy at the proposed station site outside Chesham, and a public subscription raised the necessary additional funds to extend the railway into the centre of the town. The Chesham branch opened in 1889.|$|E
5|$|The Clearview Expressway and Cross Bronx Expressway Extension were {{proposed}} in 1955 by the Port Authority and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA) {{as part of}} the Port Authority's Joint Study of Arterial Facilities, in order <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> planned Throgs Neck Bridge. The Cross Bronx extension was planned to connect the bridge to several highways at the Bruckner Circle (now the Bruckner Interchange), while the Clearview was intended to connect with Horace Harding Boulevard (later the Long Island Expressway) in order to serve motorists from Long Island.|$|E

5|$|The LNWR began {{construction}} {{work on the}} surface section of the new tracks in 1909. By 1911, it had modified the plans to omit the underground section and to split its proposed electrified services into three. The first section was to follow the existing surface route into Euston on newly electrified tracks, the second section was <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> North London Railway at Chalk Farm and continue on electrified tracks from there to Broad Street station in the City of London. The third section involved {{the extension of the}} Bakerloo Tube from Paddington to Queen's Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{corridor}} for {{the northern}} segment was first used by the Nevada-California-Oregon Railway, a line also started in 1880, at Reno, <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Great Northern Railway in Oregon. This line also was never completed, ending at Lakeview, Oregon. A portion of this line is still active, {{through a series of}} acquisitions, the Union Pacific Railroad now owns this line. The portion from Reno to Hallelujah Junction is used as a connection between the Union Pacific's two main lines in northern California/Nevada, the Overland Route (First Transcontinental Railroad) and the Feather River Route.|$|E
5|$|To the north, {{from the}} Masan-Chinju highway to the Nam River, were several easily {{defensible}} positions. The most favorable {{was the high}} ground near Chungam-ni, which controlled an important junction connecting the Masan road with the road over the Nam River to Uiryong. It was essential for the US 25th Infantry Division's right flank <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> left flank of the US 24th Infantry Division at {{the confluence of the}} Nam and the Naktong Rivers. Therefore, the 25th Infantry Division also moved to protect the Komam-ni road intersection where the Chindong-ni-Haman road met the Masan-Chinju highway.|$|E

5|$|A forward {{command post}} of the HV General Staff was moved from Ogulin to Slunj, and it assumed direct {{command of the}} 1st Guards Brigade, the 14th Home Guard Regiment and the 99th Brigade. The 14th Home Guard Regiment secured the Slunj area and {{deployed}} to the left bank of Korana <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> advancing Karlovac special police. Elements of the regiment and the 99th Brigade secured the national border in the area. The 1st Guards Brigade advanced towards Kordun, as the Karlovac Corps reoriented its main axis of attack. The 110th Home Guard Regiment and elements of the 104th Brigade reached a largely deserted Vojnić in early afternoon, followed by the 1st Guards Brigade, the 143rd Home Guard Brigade and the 137th Home Guard Regiment. Other HV units joined them by evening.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Kepple, {{one of the}} {{original}} Altoona & Wopsononock directors, was elected president of the newly organized company. The board remained largely unchanged, although Shellenberger finally severed his association with the railroad. It remained unprofitable, and Davis, in turn, sold the line to Sigmund Morris, of Altoona. Morris had incorporated the Altoona Northern Railroad on November 7, 1912 to acquire the line, and the Altoona, Juniata and Northern was merged into it on January 16, 1913. Morris planned to convert the railroad to , electrify it to make it an interurban, and extend it <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Beech Creek Railroad (a subsidiary of the New York Central Railroad) at Patton. However, Morris was unable to execute these plans. A group of New York City investors took over the railroad about 1916. They converted the railroad to standard gauge, operating initially with ex-Pennsylvania Railroad 2-6-0s, but replacing them with Heislers when the 2-6-0s were found to be unsuitable for the track.|$|E
5|$|Highway {{construction}} in the mid-1930s further altered the park. The first of these proposals was the Grand Concourse Extension, later the Mosholu Parkway Extension, which was already being paved in 1934, when Robert Moses became Parks Commissioner. Moses immediately started planning for the Henry Hudson Parkway, which was originally envisioned {{as an extension of}} Riverside Drive. As proposed, the parkway would have only skirted the park's northwest corner in order <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Saw Mill River Parkway in Westchester. However, due to that plan's high cost, the route was amended and the Henry Hudson Parkway became an extension of the West Side Elevated Highway, cutting straight through the park to intersect with the Saw Mill River Parkway. Unlike the Concourse extension, the Henry Hudson Parkway was minimally opposed by the community, as it was widely seen as an improvement. Work on the parkway began in 1935.|$|E

DelDOT plans to upgrade US 113 on its present alignment through the study area, which runs from south of Redden Road to north of DE 16. Along much of the route, service roads would be constructed parallel to the present highway {{to provide access to}} properties along US 113 and <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> local road system and reduce the number of contact points with US 113.

5|$|In 1885 the Great North re-timed the 10:10am Aberdeen {{service to}} reach Keith at 11:50am with through {{carriages}} that reached Elgin via Craigellachie at 1pm. This {{connected with a}} Highland service at both Keith and Elgin, until the Highland re-timed the train and broke the connection at Elgin. The Great North applied to the Board of Trade for an order for two connections a day at Elgin. This was refused, but in 1886 the Great North and Highland railways came to an agreement to pool receipts from the stations between Grange and Elgin and refer any disputes to an arbiter. The midday Highland train was re-timed <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Great North at Keith and Elgin, and a service connected at Elgin with an Aberdeen train that had divided en route to travel via the coast and Craigellachie.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, M-35 from Negaunee to Big Bay to L'Anse {{was officially}} {{canceled}} {{as a state}} trunkline highway. Constructed portions were turned over to local control, becoming Skanee Road in Baraga County and CR510 in Marquette County. This left a discontinuous routing for 13years. The southern segment of M-35 ran from Menominee to Negaunee, and the northern segment ran from Baraga to Ontonagon along the modern M-38. The two segments were rejoined in 1953, closing the gap left by the cancelled Huron Mountain route. M-35 signs were added to existing highway signs westward {{from the end of}} the southern segment at Negaunee along US41/M-28 and US41 to Baraga, <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> northern segment westward to Ontonagon.|$|E
