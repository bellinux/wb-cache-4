To stitch together the legends that compose the rest of the book told by these elders, the character, “Cuco de los Sueños,” is introduced. The narrator then tells two anecdotes, one about Brother Pedro de Betancourt and another about Fray Payo Enriquez de Rivera. Both stories emphasize transformation and contrasting elements. Asturias' main argument is that Guatemala is a nation built on nations and <b>that</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> possible.|$|E

Although acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifle any significant change to this system, he sees reason for optimism, citing the historical examples of the social rejection of slavery as immoral, the advances in women's rights, and the forcing of government to justify invasions to illustrate how change is possible. He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last resort to be avoided if possible, citing the example of historical revolutions where the population's welfare has worsened {{as a result of the}} upheaval.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{the present}} paper direct as well as {{indirect}} relationships between organizational changes and exposure to bullying at work are investigated. Interpersonal conflicts are hypothesized to mediate changes on bullying. Data from a sample of 2408 Norwegian employees confirmed <b>that</b> different organizational <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> moderately associated with task-related bullying at work, and that exposure to more changes increased the likelihood of being bullied. Structural equation modelling supported the assumption <b>that</b> <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> directly related to bullying. However, the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> mediated on bullying through interpersonal conflicts was not supported. Results indicate <b>that</b> organizational <b>changes</b> and interpersonal conflicts are separate, and mainly independent, precursors of bullying at work...|$|R

But <b>that</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> still not quite enough because {{it fails to}} take into account the fact that both photons and electrons can be polarized, which is to say that their orientations in space and time have to be taken into account. Therefore, P(A to B) actually consists of 16 complex numbers, or probability amplitude arrows. There are also some minor changes to do with the quantity [...] "j", which may have to be rotated by a multiple of 90° for some polarizations, which is only of interest for the detailed bookkeeping.|$|E

He adds that although the way forward is long and hard (the events of early 2011 being an important station in it), we should hold on to the hope rescued by the Arab Spring and believe that a better future can be built by our own hands.|$|E
2500|$|Analysts {{agree that}} the role of chamber music in society has changed profoundly in the last 50 years; yet there is little {{agreement}} as to what <b>that</b> <b>change</b> <b>is.</b> On the one hand, Baron contends that [...] "chamber music in the home... remained very important in Europe and America until the Second World War, after which the increasing invasion of radio and recording reduced its scope considerably." [...] This view is supported by subjective impressions.

2500|$|Al-Mashari and Zairi (2000) {{suggest that}} BPR {{involves}} changes in people behavior and culture, processes, and technology. [...] As a result, {{there are many}} factors that prevent the effective implementation of BPR and hence restrict innovation and continuous improvement. Change management, which involves all human and social related changes and cultural adjustment techniques needed by management to facilitate the insertion of newly designed processes and structures into working practice and {{to deal effectively with}} resistance,is considered by many researchers to be a crucial component of any BPR effort.One of the most overlooked obstacles to successful BPR project implementation is resistance from those whom implementers believe will benefit the most. [...] Most projects underestimate the cultural effect of major process and structural change and as a result, do not achieve the full potential of their change effort. [...] Many people fail to understand <b>that</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> not an event, but rather a management technique.|$|E

2500|$|Feminist history {{refers to}} the re-reading of history from a female perspective. [...] It {{is not the same}} as the history of feminism, which {{outlines}} the origins and evolution of the feminist movement. [...] It also differs from women's history, which focuses on the role of women in historical events. [...] The goal of feminist history is to explore and illuminate the female viewpoint of history through rediscovery of female writers, artists, philosophers, etc., in order to recover and demonstrate the significance of women's voices and choices in the past. Feminist History seeks to change the nature of history to include gender into all aspects of historical analysis, while also looking through a critical feminist lens. Jill Matthews states “the purpose of <b>that</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> political: to challenge the practices of the historical discipline that have belittled and oppressed women, and to create practices that allow women an autonomy and space for self-definition” ...|$|E

In the back-to-front world of Russian politics, it is not too little democracy that many people fear, but too much of it. This, I discovered, is why some are calling for Putin to stay on for a third term. Not because they admire him—privately, many say that he and his cronies are just as corrupt and disdainful of others as their communist predecessors were—but because they mistrust the idea of democracy, resent the West for pushing it, and fear what might happen as a result of next year's elections. Recent experience has taught them <b>that</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> usually for the worse and best avoided." ...|$|E
2500|$|Contrary {{to critics}} of originalism, originalists {{do not always}} agree upon an answer to a {{constitutional}} question, {{nor is there any}} requirement that they have to. There is room for disagreement as to what original meaning was, and even more as to how that original meaning applies to the situation before the court. But the originalist at least knows what he is looking for: the original meaning of the text. Usually, that is easy to discern and simple to apply. Sometimes there will be disagreement regarding the original meaning; and sometimes there will be disagreement as to how that original meaning applies to new and unforeseen phenomena. How, for example, does the First Amendment of the U.S. constitution guarantee of [...] "the freedom of speech" [...] apply to new technologies that did not exist when the guarantee was codified—to sound trucks, or to government-licensed over-the-air television? In such new fields the Court must follow the trajectory of the First Amendment, so to speak, to determine what it requires, and that enterprise is not entirely cut-and-dried, but requires the exercise of judgment. But the difficulties and uncertainties of determining original meaning and applying it to modern circumstances are negligible compared with the difficulties and uncertainties of the philosophy which says that the constitution changes; that the very act which it once prohibited it now permits, and which it once permitted it now forbids; and that the key to <b>that</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> unknown and unknowable. The originalist, if he does not have all the answers, has many of them.|$|E
