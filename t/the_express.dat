5|$|At Carroll Street, <b>the</b> <b>express</b> tracks ramp up {{to rejoin}} the local tracks, and all four tracks rise onto the Culver Viaduct, curving onto Ninth Street. East of Fourth Avenue station towards Park Slope, the tracks become a subway once again. Past 7th Avenue, the local tracks diverge, curving south to 15th Street and Prospect Park West, while <b>the</b> <b>express</b> tracks take a direct route beneath Prospect Park. This {{is one of two}} places in the subway where <b>the</b> <b>express</b> tracks diverge from the local tracks, the other being on the IND Queens Boulevard Line between 65th Street and 36th Street. <b>The</b> <b>express</b> tracks rejoin the {{right-of-way}} at approximately Terrace Place and Prospect Avenue, running on a lower level under Prospect Avenue and Fort Hamilton Parkway near the Prospect Park Parade Grounds, then rise up as the line curves onto McDonald Avenue. The line then parallels the route of the original Culver Line surface railroad into Church Avenue station, the last stop of the original IND service.|$|E

5|$|A six-track Second Avenue Subway between 149th Street, the Bronx, to Grand Street, Manhattan. This {{line would}} handle 68 trains per hour (tph) (34 tph on <b>the</b> <b>express</b> tracks and 34 tph {{on the local}} tracks).|$|E
5|$|As {{originally}} {{proposed in}} 1925, the line's junction with the IND Crosstown Line in Long Island City {{would have been}} a T-junction, allowing trains from Manhattan to travel south to Brooklyn via the Crosstown line. A map from June of that year shows a proposed alternate routing for the Queens Boulevard Line, that would have had the line turn via Kew Gardens Road after the Union Turnpike station instead of continuing via Queens Boulevard. After proceeding via Kew Gardens Road the line would have turned via Hillside Avenue. The map also shows a two-track line continuing from the Van Wyck Boulevard station to 94th Avenue (Atlantic Avenue) in Richmond Hill via Van Wyck Boulevard (today's Van Wyck Expressway). During construction only bellmouths were built for the line, however they were eventually used for the IND Archer Avenue Line. As documented by the map, the Queens Boulevard Line, as originally planned, would have had <b>the</b> <b>express</b> trains travel on a more direct route, via Broadway and Queens Boulevard, while the local trains would take a less direct route hitting larger population centers. There were to be two such instances, however only one was actually completed. The first one, which was not constructed, would have gone through Winfield (now Woodside), west of the existing Elmhurst Avenue station, and the local tracks would have diverged, continuing via Queens Broadway before turning onto 69th Street (Fisk Avenue), rejoining <b>the</b> <b>express</b> tracks at Broadway in Woodside. The second instance, the one that was built, was planned to have the local tracks continue via Broadway west of the 65th Street station, and then it would turn south via Steinway Street before rejoining <b>the</b> <b>express</b> tracks at the 36th Street station. <b>The</b> <b>express</b> tracks here would take the more direct route, via Northern Boulevard.|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street was {{originally}} designed as an express station, {{but only the}} upper level is currently in service; the lower level is neither in regular service nor usable due to its deteriorated condition. The lower level of the station was used when express service was provided on the Culver Line between 1968 and 1976. Express service was eliminated due {{to the loss of}} direct local service along the line to Manhattan. <b>The</b> <b>express</b> platforms were permanently removed from service during the 1990s, and due to a fire in 1999 the relay room was damaged, making <b>the</b> <b>express</b> tracks unusable. The relay room was rebuilt in 2008, and after repairs were done on the line, the implementation of express service become feasible. In 2016, it was announced that the MTA was considering having express service brought back to the line. However, unlike the earlier express service, express trains will skip this station due to the high cost of rebuilding it, thus making the station a local stop.|$|E

5|$|On {{this section}} of the line, there is Communications-based train control (CBTC) {{equipment}} on the southbound express track between Fourth Avenue and Church Avenue, as part of the automation of the New York City Subway. The total cost is $99.6 million, with $15 million coming from the 2005–2009 capital budget (phase one) and $84.6 million from the 2010–2014 capital budget (phase two). The installation is a joint venture between Siemens and Thales Group, and is used to test the track's new signaling on R143s and R160s that are already equipped with CBTC. The estimated completion date was scheduled for March 2015; the installation is expected to be permanent. If Culver Line express service is implemented in 2017 as it was proposed, <b>the</b> <b>express</b> service would not initially use CBTC, and testing of CBTC on <b>the</b> <b>express</b> track will be limited to off-peak hours.
