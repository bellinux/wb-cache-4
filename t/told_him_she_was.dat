5|$|Too weak {{to stand}} or walk, Beauchamp was loaded onto a cart to be {{conveyed}} to the gallows. He begged to see Anna, but the guards <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not seriously injured. The guards finally {{allowed him to}} see Anna, and Beauchamp was angered that they had underplayed her critical condition. He stayed with her until {{he could no longer}} feel her pulse; then the guards took him to the gallows to be hanged before he died of his stab wounds.|$|E
5|$|After {{a memorable}} 90th birthday, {{where she was}} {{surrounded}} by her now vast family, Zita's strong health began to fail. She developed inoperable cataracts in both eyes. Her last big family gathering took place at Zizers, in 1987, when her children and grandchildren joined in celebrating Empress Zita's 95th birthday. While visiting her daughter, in summer 1988, she developed pneumonia {{and spent most of}} the autumn and winter bedridden. Finally, she called Otto, in early March 1989, and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> dying. He {{and the rest of the}} family travelled to her bedside and took turns keeping her company until she died in the early hours of 14 March 1989. She was 96 years old, and was the last surviving child of Robert, Duke of Parma from both his marriages.|$|E
5|$|Opening {{arguments}} by both {{prosecution and}} defense set up cases based on purported times of death. Basing their assertion on pathologist-given testimony that Jones had died {{about six hours}} after she ate lunch on May 26, the prosecution claimed that Jones had died more than 24 hours before Kinne and Boldizs found her body; defense attorneys argued that death had more likely occurred six to eight hours prior. Prosecutor J. Arnott Hill cited testimony by Chief of Detectives Lieutenant Harry Nesbitt and by Patricia Jones's husband, Walter, as evidence of Kinne's motive for the crime: the detective recalled statements by Kinne that she was afraid Jones was drifting away from her despite the financial support she offered him, and Jones testified that Kinne had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> pregnant by him and he had thereafter attempted to end the relationship.|$|E

25|$|Fontanne went {{to great}} lengths to avoid divulging her true age. Her husband {{reportedly}} died believing she was five years younger than he (as she had <b>told</b> <b>him).</b> <b>She</b> <b>was,</b> in fact, five years older, but continued to deny, long after Lunt's death, that she was born in 1887.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with other}} Ripper victims, Kelly's origins are obscure and undocumented, {{and much of}} it is {{possibly}} embellished. Kelly may have herself fabricated many details of her early life as there is no corroborating documentary evidence, but {{there is no evidence to}} the contrary either. According to Joseph Barnett, the man she had most recently lived with prior to her murder, Kelly had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> born in Limerick, Ireland, in around 1863—although whether she referred to the city or the county is not known—and that her family moved to Wales when she was young.|$|E
25|$|As {{the weeks}} pass, Blanche and Stanley {{continue}} to not get along. Blanche has hope in Mitch, and tells Stella {{that she wants}} to go away with him and not be anyone’s problem. During a meeting between the two, Blanche confesses to Mitch that once she was married to a young man, Allan Grey, whom she later discovered in a sexual encounter with an older man. Grey later committed suicide when Blanche <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> disgusted with him. The story touches Mitch, who tells Blanche that they need each other. It seems certain that they will get married.|$|E

500|$|Weakened {{by his own}} wounds, Beauchamp {{was loaded}} on a cart {{to be taken to}} the gallows and hanged before he bled to death. He insisted on seeing his wife before being executed, but doctors <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not {{severely}} injured and would recover. Beauchamp protested that not being allowed to see his wife was cruel, and the guards consented to take him to her. Upon arriving, he was angered to see that the doctors had lied to him; Anna was too weak even to speak to him. He remained with her until he could no longer feel her pulse. He kissed her lifeless lips and declared [...] "For you I lived [...] for you I die." ...|$|E
500|$|After obtaining {{commercial}} success with first two singles, [...] "Smile" [...] and [...] "LDN", Allen decided {{to promote the}} album by releasing [...] "Littlest Things". The song was composed in New York, where Allen travelled after she had met producer Mark Ronson when at lunch with her then boyfriend, Seb. There, she <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a singer {{and gave him a}} copy of her demo CD. He was impressed by her song [...] "Smile" [...] and asked her to work together. Regarding the process of composing the song, Ronson stated: We spent a day together and worked on a couple of things, and went to record shops where I played samples to her. Then I wrote the piano and guitar bit to [...] "Littlest Things", and she sat down and scribbled for about an hour and finished the lyrics.|$|E

500|$|In January 1953, Leigh {{travelled}} to Ceylon to film Elephant Walk with Peter Finch. Shortly after filming commenced, she had {{a nervous}} breakdown and Paramount Pictures replaced her with Elizabeth Taylor. Olivier returned her to their home in Britain, where, between periods of incoherence, Leigh <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in love with Finch and had been {{having an affair with}} him. Over a period of several months, she gradually recovered. As a result of this episode, many of the Oliviers' friends learned of her problems. David Niven said she had been [...] "quite, quite mad". Noël Coward expressed surprise in his diary that [...] "things had been bad and getting worse since 1948 or thereabouts". Leigh's romantic relationship with Finch began in 1948, and waxed and waned for several years, ultimately flickering out as her mental condition deteriorated.|$|E
500|$|According {{to a close}} {{collaborator}} of Molotov, Vladimir Erofeev, {{at the beginning of}} 1949 the Israel minister plenipotentiary, Golda Meir, visited the Soviet Union; she met privately with Polina, who had been her schoolmate in St. Petersburg. Immediately afterward, Polina was arrested and accused of ties with Zionist organisations; she was kept one year in the Lubyanka, after which she was exiled for three years in an obscure Russian city. Molotov had no communication with her, save for the scant news that Beria, whom he loathed, <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> freed immediately after the death of Stalin. According to Erofeev, Molotov said of her: [...] "She's not only beautiful and intelligent, the only woman minister in Soviet Union; she's also a real Bolshevik, a real Soviet person." [...] In 1949, Molotov was replaced as Foreign Minister by Andrey Vyshinsky, although retaining his position as First Deputy Premier and membership of the Politburo.|$|E
500|$|EMI Records, {{which had}} more {{experience}} in the pop market, headed the project and allowed Selena to choose one song that she liked. Her sister and drummer of the band, Suzette Quintanilla, said in a 1997 interview that the singer carefully chose a song that represented what [...] "Selena was all about". She chose [...] "Dreaming of You", which was written by American songwriters Franne Golde and Tom Snow in 1989 for American R group The Jets, who rejected it. [...] According to Snow, Golde [...] "never gave up on the tune and eventually got it to Selena". When Quintanilla III heard the demonstration recording, he told Selena {{he did not like}} the track. Selena <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> going to record it because she favored its lyrical content and message. In a 2002 interview, Quintanilla III said he was [...] "more judgmental" [...] on his first impression of the demonstration recording than the song itself and cited its medley, content, and song structure for changing his mind.|$|E

500|$|Ike and Tina began {{a sexual}} {{relationship}} in 1959, much to Tina's chagrin. Ike also felt guilt over the relationship, stating later that having sex with Tina {{felt as if he}} were having sex with a sibling. Recalling to Rolling Stone in 1986, the first time she had sex with Ike Tina said, [...] "He had broken up with the mother of his two sons, who I ended up raising. He was without a girlfriend. One of the musicians said he was going to come to my room and have sex with me. I couldn't lock the door, so I went to sleep with Ike, thinking he would protect me. Shit! It happened then, but I thought, 'Well, okay, I'll just do it once.' Didn't really know what to do because I wasn't turned on to him, even though it was good." [...] In her book, Tina stated the couple married in Tijuana, in 1962. She recalled the first time Ike physically abused her began after she <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> considering leaving Ike's group due to financial disputes and their own confusing relationship. Tina said Ike grabbed a shoe stretcher and hit her in the head with it. Afterwards, Tina said, Ike asked her to have sex with him. Tina wrote in her memoirs, I, Tina, that the incident was the first time Ike had [...] "instilled fear" [...] in her.|$|E
500|$|Mountstuart's life collapses as {{he seeks}} refuge in an {{alcoholic}} daze to escape his depression. He buys 10b Turpentine Lane, a small basement flat in Pimlico. He returns to Paris {{to finish his}} existentialist novella, The Villa by the Lake, staying with his old friend Ben Leeping (now a successful gallery owner). After a failed sexual encounter with Ordile, a young French girl working at Ben's gallery, he attempts suicide but is surprised by the girl when she returns an hour later for her Zippo lighter. Ben offers Mountstuart a job as manager of his new gallery in New York, [...] "Leeping fils". Mountstuart mildly prospers in the art scene of the 1960s, meeting artists like Willem de Kooning (whom he admires) and Jackson Pollock (whom he does not); he moves in with an American lawyer, Alannah, and her two young daughters. On his return to London, he has an affair with Gloria, Peter Scabius' third wife (Peter has become a successful author of popular novels), and in New York with Janet, a gallery owner. He eventually discovers Alannah having her own affair, and the couple split. He reconciles with his son from his first marriage, Lionel, who has moved to New York to manage a pop group, until Lionel's sudden death. Monday, Lionel's girlfriend, moves into Mountstuart's flat; at first friends, they become intimates until her father turns up and Mountstuart discovers – to his horror – that she is 16 (having <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> 19). His lawyer advises him to leave America to avoid prosecution for statutory rape.|$|E
500|$|Flight {{attendant}} CeeCee Lyles {{called her}} husband at 09:47:57 and left him a message saying the plane had been hijacked. Marion Britton called her friend, Fred Fiumano, at 09:49:12. Fiumano recalled, [...] "she said, 'We're gonna. They're gonna kill us, you know, We're gonna die.' And I told her, 'Don't worry, they hijacked the plane, they're gonna take you for a ride, you go to their country, and you come back. You stay there for vacation.' You don't know what to say—what are you gonna say? I kept on saying the same things, 'Be calm.' And she was crying and—you know—more or less crying and screaming and yelling." [...] Flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw called {{her husband at}} 09:50:04 and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> preparing scalding water to throw at the hijackers. Passenger Lauren Grandcolas called her husband twice, once before takeoff and once during the hijacking. He missed both of her calls. She then passed her phone to Honor Elizabeth Wainio. Wainio called her stepmother at 09:53:43 and concluded, {{four and a half}} minutes later, by saying, [...] "I have to go. They're breaking into the cockpit. I love you." [...] Jarrah dialed in the VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) frequency for the VOR navigational aid at Reagan National Airport at 09:55:11 to direct the plane toward Washington, D.C. Bradshaw, on the phone with her husband, said [...] "Everyone is running up to first class. I've got to go. Bye." [...] Beamer told Jefferson that the group was planning to [...] "jump on" [...] the hijackers and fly the plane into the ground before the hijackers' plan could be followed through. Beamer recited the Lord's Prayer and the 23rd Psalm with Jefferson, prompting others to join in. Beamer requested of Jefferson, [...] "If I don't make it, please call my family and let them know how much I love them." [...] After this, Jefferson heard muffled voices and Beamer clearly answering, [...] "Are you ready? Okay. Let's roll." [...] These were Beamer's last words to Jefferson.|$|E
