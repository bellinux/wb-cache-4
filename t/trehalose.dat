5|$|Cells {{can deal}} with even larger osmotic changes by accumulating osmoprotectants such as betaines or <b>trehalose</b> in their cytosol. Some of these {{molecules}} can allow cells to survive being completely dried out and allow an organism to enter a state of suspended animation called cryptobiosis. In this state the cytosol and osmoprotectants become a glass-like solid that helps stabilize proteins and cell membranes from the damaging effects of desiccation.|$|E

Fungi have membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria, sterol-containing membranes, and ribosomes of the 80S type. They have a characteristic range of soluble carbohydrates and storage compounds, including sugar alcohols (e.g., mannitol), disaccharides, (e.g., <b>trehalose),</b> and polysaccharides (e.g., glycogen, {{which is also}} found in animals).|$|E
5|$|Based on {{analyses}} of fruit bodies collected in Portugal, there are 367 kilocalories per 100 grams of bolete (as dry weight). The macronutrient composition of 100 grams of dried bolete includes 17.9 grams of protein, 72.8 grams of carbohydrates, and 0.4 grams of fat. By weight, fresh fruit bodies are about 92% water. The predominant sugar is <b>trehalose</b> (4.7 grams/100 grams dry weight; all following values assume this mass), with lesser amounts of mannitol (1.3 grams). There are 6 grams of tocopherols, {{the majority of}} which is gamma-tocopherol (vitamin E), and 3.7 grams of ascorbic acid.|$|E
25|$|All {{strains of}} S.cerevisiae can grow aerobically on glucose, maltose, and <b>trehalose</b> {{and fail to}} grow on lactose and cellobiose. However, growth on other sugars is variable. Galactose and {{fructose}} are shown to be {{two of the best}} fermenting sugars. The ability of yeasts to use different sugars can differ depending on whether they are grown aerobically or anaerobically. Some strains cannot grow anaerobically on sucrose and <b>trehalose.</b>|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{transfer}} from plant to fungi may occur through the arbuscules or intraradical hyphae. Secondary synthesis from the hexoses by AM {{occurs in the}} intraradical mycelium. Inside the mycelium, hexose is converted to <b>trehalose</b> and glycogen. <b>Trehalose</b> and glycogen are carbon storage forms that can be rapidly synthesized and degraded and may buffer the intracellular sugar concentrations. The intraradical hexose enters the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, which produces pentose for nucleic acids.|$|E
25|$|Nitrogen {{levels in}} the wine can have an {{influence}} on many sensory aspects of the resulting wine, including the synthesis of many aromatic compounds. Fusel alcohols are made by the degradation of amino acids though {{in the presence of}} high levels of ammonia and urea their production is reduced. When available nitrogen is limited, the levels of glycerol and <b>trehalose,</b> which may influence mouthfeel, are higher.|$|E
25|$|Nectar is {{collected}} by foraging worker bees {{as a source}} of water and carbohydrates in the form of sucrose. The dominant monosaccharides in honey bee diets are fructose and glucose but the most common circulating sugar in hemolymph is <b>trehalose</b> which is a disaccharide consisting of two glucose molecules. Adult worker honey bees require 4mg of utilizable sugars per day and larvae require about 59.4mg of carbohydrates for proper development.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} soluble carbohydrates {{of mature}} soybeans are the disaccharide sucrose (range 2.5–8.2%), the trisaccharide raffinose (0.1–1.0%) composed of one sucrose molecule connected to one molecule of galactose, and the tetrasaccharide stachyose (1.4 to 4.1%) composed of one sucrose connected to two molecules of galactose. While the oligosaccharides raffinose and stachyose protect {{the viability of}} the soybean seed from desiccation (see above section on physical characteristics) they are not digestible sugars, so contribute to flatulence and abdominal discomfort in humans and other monogastric animals, comparable to the disaccharide <b>trehalose.</b> Undigested oligosaccharides are broken down in the intestine by native microbes, producing gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane.|$|E
500|$|P.exclamans {{lives in}} a {{hierarchical}} society with one queen that lays the eggs. However, all of the females have the same morphology {{and they all have}} the physiological capability of taking over the egg laying if necessary (queen death, queen migration). Since the queen has the same morphology {{as the rest of the}} workers in the colony, this raises the question as to how the queen role is assigned and what makes her special. Studies have found that queens and males have higher levels of glucose, fructose and <b>trehalose</b> than workers, leading to higher cryoprotectant levels. P.exclamans use these sugars as cryoprotectant, which work by increasing the solute concentration in cells. This results in a greater survivability in colder weather. It was found that queens have a 76% survival rate in [...] weather compared to 17% survival of the workers over a 15-day test period. The queens also have a 0.5mm layer of fat surrounding their bodies. This allows them to live longer into the winter and possibly extend their mating season. The queens seem to be the only ones capable of diapause.|$|E

2500|$|The peridium, which {{consists}} of six distinct layers, forms two [...] "cups" [...] at maturity. Three layers form the outer cup, two form the inner cup, and one layer dissolves to create the fluid that bathes the gleba. After splitting of the peridal layers to expose the gleba, enzymatic conversion of glycogen to glucose increases the internal osmotic pressure and the turgidity of palisade cells in the inner peridial cup. Analysis of the glebal carbohydrates revealed an increase in glucose, mannitol, and <b>trehalose</b> prior to glebal discharge, which would account for the increase in osmotic pressure. Glebal discharge typically occurs 56 hours after the apex has split. In S. stellatus, the gleba may be thrown up to 6 meters horizontally. This species is phototropic, and the nearest source of direct or reflected light will be the target for glebal discharge.|$|E
2500|$|Monosaccharides [...] are {{the major}} source of fuel for metabolism, being used both as an energy source (glucose being the most {{important}} in nature) and in biosynthesis. When monosaccharides are not immediately needed by many cells they are often converted to more space-efficient forms, often polysaccharides. In many animals, including humans, this storage form is glycogen, especially in liver and muscle cells. In plants, starch is used for the same purpose. The most abundant carbohydrate, cellulose, is a structural component of the cell wall of plants and many forms of algae. Ribose is a component of RNA. Deoxyribose is a component of DNA. Lyxose is a component of lyxoflavin found in the human heart. Ribulose and xylulose occur in the pentose phosphate pathway. Galactose, a component of milk sugar lactose, is found in galactolipids in plant cell membranes and in glycoproteins in many tissues. Mannose occurs in human metabolism, especially in the glycosylation of certain proteins. Fructose, or fruit sugar, is found in many plants and in humans, it is metabolized in the liver, absorbed directly into the intestines during digestion, and found in semen. <b>Trehalose,</b> a major sugar of insects, is rapidly hydrolyzed into two glucose molecules to support continuous flight.|$|E

50|$|One {{molecule}} of <b>trehalose</b> is hydrolyzed to two {{molecules of}} glucose by the enzyme trehalase. Enzymatic hydrolysis of <b>trehalose</b> was first observed in Aspergillus niger by Bourquelot in 1893. Fischer reported this reaction in S. cerevisiae in 1895. Since then the <b>trehalose</b> hydrolyzing enzyme, trehalase (α, α-trehalose-1-C-glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.28) {{has been reported}} from many other organisms including plants and animals. Though <b>trehalose</b> is not known {{to be present in}} mammals, trehalase enzyme is found to be present in the kidney brush border membrane and the intestinal villi membranes. In the intestine the function of this enzyme is to hydrolyze ingested <b>trehalose.</b> Individuals with a defect in their intestinal trehalase have diarrhea when they eat foods with high <b>trehalose</b> content, such as mushrooms. <b>Trehalose</b> hydrolysis by trehalase enzyme is an important physiological process for various organisms, such as fungal spore germination, insect flight, and the resumption of growth in resting cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trehalose</b> is a nonreducing sugar {{formed from}} two glucose units {{joined by a}} 1-1 alpha bond, giving it the name of α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→1)-α-D-glucopyranoside.

5000|$|<b>Trehalose,</b> {{also known}} as mycose or tremalose, is a natural alpha-linked {{disaccharide}} formed by an α,α-1,1-glucoside bond between two α-glucose units. In 1832, H.A.L.
