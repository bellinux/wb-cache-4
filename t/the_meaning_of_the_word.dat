5|$|<b>The</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> law in Article 9(1) has {{a direct}} bearing on {{the scope of the}} Article. If law is read broadly (for example, as {{incorporating}} customary international law principles), the scope of the fundamental liberties would be wider. It would be narrower if, on the other hand, law is construed narrowly, as the Legislature would be able to curtail such rights through legislation more easily. This could lead to a watering-down of the emphasis on fundamental liberties, as any infringement might be considered legitimate so long as the statute in question was validly enacted.|$|E
5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{relationships}} between cohesion in texts and <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> texts. I analyze hard news texts and the summaries written by competent readers for the texts in terms of nuclei (i. e. <b>the</b> combinations <b>of</b> Process and Medium) (Halliday, 1994), and examine <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nuclei that recur in a text and are also considered as important to <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text. There are two main findings of my present study. The first is that when two or more recurrent nuclei in a text are considered as important to <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text, the relationship in the lead that holds between the nuclei are also thought of as important to <b>the</b> text's <b>meaning.</b> This finding provides evidence for the claim made by many linguists that the conjunctive relations that hold between the propositions in a passage are important to <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passage. The other main finding of my study {{is that when the}} nuclei that are considered as important to <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> texts in which they occur are found in leads, they have a strong tendency to occur in primary or independent clauses; on the other hand, when the nuclei occurring in leads are however not considered as important to <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> texts in which they occur, they tend to occur in secondary or embedded clauses. This finding indicates that <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> information in leads is not random. The propositions in a lead that are important to <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text in which they occur are often foregrounded in major types of clause, while those that are not thought <b>of</b> as important to <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text are often backgrounded in minor types of clause.

25|$|In 1720, the Maréchaussée de France, {{a police}} force under the {{authority}} of the marshals of France, was put under the administrative authority of the Gendarmerie de France. The Gendarmerie was dissolved in 1788 and the Maréchaussée in 1791, only to be recreated as a new police force of military status, the gendarmerie Nationale, which still exists. This explains the evolution of <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> gendarme from a noble man-at-arms to a military police officer.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{apart from}} Mithu, the cases cited such as Reyes and Woodson were decided in {{different}} textual contexts, as inhuman punishment was expressly prohibited by the constitutions {{of the respective}} jurisdictions from which the cases originated.

25|$|Vocabulary: A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} reading comprehension is vocabulary development. When a reader encounters an unfamiliar word {{in print and}} decodes it to derive its spoken pronunciation, the reader understands the word {{if it is in}} the reader's spoken vocabulary. Otherwise, the reader must derive <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> using another strategy, such as context. If the development of the child's vocabulary is impeded by things such as ear infections, that inhibit the child from hearing new words consistently, then the development of reading will also be impaired.|$|E

25|$|Wittgenstein {{rejects the}} idea that ostensive {{definitions}} can provide us with {{the meaning of a}} word. For Wittgenstein, the thing that the word stands for does not give <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word.</b> Wittgenstein argues for this making a series of moves to show that to understand an ostensive definition presupposes an understanding of the way the word being defined is used. So, for instance, there is no difference between pointing to a piece of paper, to its colour, or to its shape; but understanding the difference is crucial to using the paper in an ostensive definition of a shape or of a colour.|$|E
25|$|The {{publication}} of the historical dictionary of the Spanish language allows us to document both, alajur very broadly written as alajú and alfajor. Alajur and multiple geographic variations are sweets made of a paste of almonds, nuts, breadcrumbs and honey. It is effectively possible that alfajor and alajú were Arabisms introduced into the Spanish language in different places and times, and, supposing both {{came from the same}} etymon, from the phonetic point of view, alajú is an Arabism of the Castillian, and so it is still alive in Cuenca, Toledo, Guadalajara and in la Sierra de la peña de Francia; meanwhile the variation alfajor is Andalusian and Murcian. In the Americas, <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> alfajor was not known until the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|According to Michel Christol though, this {{interpretation}} overly restricts <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> libertas. In Christol’s view, {{it is important}} not to forget that the emperor’s decision in 205 must have been taken in response to a request made by the civitas and must have taken account of the relations that already existed between it and the pagus. It was the autonomy that the civitas had achieved during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and the granting of Roman law that raised the spectre of a fusion of the two communities, which would without a doubt have provoked a certain unease in the pagus. The inhabitants of the pagus would have expressed “concern or even refusal when faced with the pretensions of their closest neighbours”. This would explain the honour that the pagus attributed to Commodus (conservator pagi, protector of the pagus) '.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeal was of {{the opinion}} that {{customary}} international law cannot be incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> law in Article 9(1) of the Constitution. Customary international law rules do not have any status in domestic law until they are first accepted and adopted as part of domestic law. This can occur when a rule is incorporated into a statute (in which case it is no longer a customary international law rule but is regarded as domestic law), or when it is judicially declared {{to be part of the}} common law of Singapore. However, customary international law can only be incorporated into the common law when it is not inconsistent with existing domestic laws. Given the existence of the mandatory death penalty in several Singapore statutes, the Court {{was of the}} opinion that it could not treat the alleged customary international law rule prohibiting inhuman punishment as part of Singapore common law. Also, even if a rule has been incorporated in this manner, it may be overridden by subsequent inconsistent statutory provisions. Moreover, the Court did not accept the contention that customary international law should be conferred constitutional status by being read into the meaning of law in Article 9(1) as this is clearly not in accordance with the normal hierarchy of Singapore law.|$|E
