5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{example is}} found in <b>the</b> <b>Amish</b> migration to Pennsylvania in 1744. Two {{members of the new}} colony shared the recessive allele for Ellis–van Creveld syndrome. Members of the colony and their descendants tend to be religious isolates and remain relatively insular. As a result of many generations of inbreeding, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is now much more prevalent among <b>the</b> <b>Amish</b> than in the general population.|$|E

5|$|In The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia, Thomson {{points out}} the {{benefits}} in some level (albeit small) of separatist policies. He argues the benefits of allowing ethnic groups, like <b>the</b> <b>Amish</b> and the Hutterites in the United States and Canada or the Sami in Norway, {{to live on the}} edges of governance. These are ethnic groups that would prefer to retain their ethnic identity and thus prefer separatist policies for themselves, as they do not require them to conform to policies for all ethnicities of the nation.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Holmes County <b>Amish</b> {{settlement}} {{was founded in}} 1808 and the Holmes Old Order <b>Amish</b> affiliation was <b>the</b> main <b>Amish</b> body there, from which many other Amish affiliation separated, for example <b>the</b> Swartzentruber <b>Amish</b> in 1913 of <b>the</b> Andy Weaver <b>Amish</b> in 1952.

5|$|The Middle Colonies {{were the}} religiously diverse {{part of the}} British Empire, {{with a high degree}} of tolerance. The Penn family were Quakers, and the colony became a {{favorite}} destination for that group as well as German Lutherans, German Reformed and numerous small sects such as Mennonites, Amish and Moravians, not to mention Scotch Irish Presbyterians. The Dutch Reformed were strong in upstate New York and New Jersey, and Congregationalists were important in Long Island. The First Great Awakening invigorated religiosity and helped stimulate the growth of Congregational, Methodist and Baptist churches. Non-British colonists included Dutch Calvinist, Swedish Lutherans, Palatine Mennonites, and <b>the</b> <b>Amish.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Thirteen Colonies of the {{original}} United States were all former English possessions, and Anglo culture became a major foundation for American folk and popular music. Many American folk songs are identical to British songs in arrangements, but with new lyrics, often as parodies of {{the original}} material. American-Anglo songs are also characterized as having fewer pentatonic tunes, less prominent accompaniment (but with heavier use of drones) and more melodies in major. Anglo-American traditional music also includes a variety of broadside ballads, humorous stories and tall tales, and disaster songs regarding mining, shipwrecks, and murder. Legendary heroes like Joe Magarac, John Henry, and Jesse James are part of many songs. Folk dances of British origin include the square dance, descended from the quadrille, combined with the American innovation of a caller instructing the dancers. The religious communal society known as the Shakers emigrated from England during the 18th century and developed their own folk dance style. Their early songs can be dated back to British folk song models. Other religious societies established their own unique musical cultures early in American history, such as the music of <b>the</b> <b>Amish,</b> the Harmony Society, and the Ephrata Cloister in Pennsylvania.|$|E

50|$|Concerning {{the use of}} technologies, <b>the</b> Nebraska <b>Amish</b> {{are about}} as {{restrictive}} as <b>the</b> Swartzentruber <b>Amish,</b> see table below.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Amish</b> do {{not usually}} educate their {{children}} past the eighth grade, {{believing that the}} basic knowledge offered {{up to that point}} is sufficient to prepare one for <b>the</b> <b>Amish</b> lifestyle. Almost no Amish go to high school and college. In many communities, <b>the</b> <b>Amish</b> operate their own schools, which are typically one-room schoolhouses with teachers (usually young, unmarried women) from <b>the</b> <b>Amish</b> community. On May 19, 1972, Jonas Yoder and Wallace Miller of the Old Order Amish, and Adin Yutzy of the Conservative Amish Mennonite Church, were each fined $5 for refusing to send their children, aged 14 and 15, to high school. In Wisconsin v. Yoder, the Wisconsin Supreme Court overturned the conviction, and the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed this, finding the benefits of universal education were not sufficient justification to overcome scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.|$|E
