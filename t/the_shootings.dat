5|$|After ten days' investigation, Oxley was {{surprised}} to learn that the Gibraltar Police were handling the police investigation into <b>the</b> <b>shootings,</b> having been closely involved in the events leading up to them. He also grew concerned that the police investigation was insufficiently rigorous when he learned that the police had not taken statements from residents whose flats overlooked the scene of Farrell's and McCann's deaths. The Gibraltar coroner, Felix Pizzarello, welcomed This Weeks investigation, telling Oxley that he hoped the journalists would uncover witnesses who could assist the inquest. While Oxley was investigating <b>the</b> <b>shootings</b> from Gibraltar, Manyon travelled to Madrid in an attempt {{to learn more about the}} surveillance operation which took place in Spain prior to <b>the</b> <b>shootings.</b> Bolton added Alison Cahn to the team on 18 March; her task was to visit the flats which overlooked the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot, with the aim of interviewing any residents who might have witnessed the events of 6 March. After several days' work, the team found two eyewitnesses to <b>the</b> <b>shootings</b> who were willing to speak on camera: Stephen Bullock, a local lawyer who had witnessed the events while out for a walk with his wife; and Josie Celecia, a housewife who had seen the shooting of McCann and Savage from her apartment window. Both witnesses' statements appeared to the journalists to be inconsistent with the official account of <b>the</b> <b>shootings.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{technical}} advice, {{the journalists}} engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles GC, a retired British Army {{officer who was}} regarded as an expert in explosives and ballistics. Styles believed {{that it would have}} been obvious to the authorities that Savage's car was unlikely to contain a bomb as the weight would have been obvious on the vehicle's springs; he also expressed his opinion that a remote detonator could not have reached the car park from the scenes of <b>the</b> <b>shootings</b> given the number of buildings and other obstacles between the locations. As the government refused to comment on <b>the</b> <b>shootings</b> until the inquest, the documentary concluded by putting its evidence to a leading human rights lawyer, who expressed his belief that a judicial inquiry was necessary to establish the facts surrounding <b>the</b> <b>shootings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several Gibraltar Police officers, {{including}} Special Branch officers, gave {{evidence about}} the aftermath of <b>the</b> <b>shootings</b> and the subsequent police investigation. Immediately after <b>the</b> <b>shootings,</b> the soldiers' shell casings {{were removed from the}} scene (making it difficult to assess where the soldiers were standing when they fired); two Gibraltar Police officers testified to collecting the casings, one for fear that they might be stolen and the other on the orders of a superior. Statements from other police and military witnesses revealed that the Gibraltar Police had lost evidence and that the soldiers did not give statements to the police until over a week after <b>the</b> <b>shootings.</b>|$|E

5|$|According to U.S. authorities, {{a single}} soldier – Staff Sergeant Robert Bales – {{conducted}} the attack. The U.S. military showed Afghan authorities the footage from the surveillance video {{at the base}} as proof {{that there was only}} one perpetrator of <b>the</b> <b>shootings.</b>|$|E
5|$|The journalists quickly {{decided they}} needed expert advice on {{ballistics}} and explosives, to which end they engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles, GC, a retired British Army {{officer who had}} served as a bomb-disposal officer in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Styles arrived in Gibraltar on 23 March, and immediately went to inspect the car park where Savage had parked the white Renault on the day of <b>the</b> <b>shootings,</b> after which he walked through the town along what the journalists believed was the IRA members' most likely route. When asked his opinion by the journalists, Styles cast doubt on the authorities' stated reasons for <b>the</b> <b>shootings.</b> He explained to the journalists that, had Savage's white Renault contained a substantial bomb, the weight would have been evident on the vehicle's springs. Styles also felt that the potential bomb was unlikely to have been detonated with a remote detonator on account of the buildings between the scenes of <b>the</b> <b>shootings</b> and the likelihood that it would be drowned out by other radio signals in the area. Finally, the journalists asked Styles to examine the scenes of <b>the</b> <b>shootings,</b> including ricochet marks that the soldiers' bullets had left on the pumps at the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot.|$|E
5|$|Gabrielle Giffords was {{reported}} to be the target of <b>the</b> <b>shootings.</b> Some news organizations initially reported that she had been killed, but these statements were quickly revised to reflect that she had survived with a gunshot wound to the head. Daniel Hernandez Jr., one of Giffords's interns, assisted her after she was wounded and is credited with saving her life.|$|E
50|$|The Hungerford {{massacre}} remains, {{along with}} <b>the</b> 1989 Monkseaton <b>shootings,</b> <b>the</b> 1996 Dunblane school massacre, and <b>the</b> 2010 Cumbria <b>shootings,</b> one of <b>the</b> worst criminal atrocities involving firearms {{to occur in}} the United Kingdom. The Dunblane and Cumbria shootings had a similar number of fatalities, and in both cases the perpetrators killed themselves. Only one person died in <b>the</b> Monkseaton <b>shootings,</b> but 14 others were wounded, and the perpetrator did not kill himself.|$|R
50|$|On July 24, 2008, {{members of}} Congress {{paused for a}} moment of silence to mark <b>the</b> <b>shooting's</b> ten-year anniversary. On the east lawn of the Capitol, Democratic and Republican lawmakers planted a tree in memory of Gibson and Chestnut.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Northumbria <b>shootings</b> {{occurred}} {{exactly one}} month after <b>the</b> Cumbria <b>shootings,</b> in which taxi driver Derrick Bird killed 12 people and injured 11 others in a wide-ranging area in the neighbouring county of Cumbria, before killing himself the same day.|$|R
5|$|Immediately after <b>the</b> <b>shootings,</b> the {{soldiers}} donned berets to identify themselves. Gibraltar Police officers, including Inspector Revagliatte and his men, began {{to arrive at}} the scene almost immediately. At 16:05, only 25 minutes after assuming control, the SAS commander handed control of the operation back to the Gibraltar Police in a document stating:A military assault force completed the military option in respect of the terrorist ASU in Gibraltar and returns control to the civil power. Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>shootings,</b> soldiers and police officers evacuated buildings {{in the vicinity of the}} Convent, while bomb-disposal experts got to work; four hours later, the authorities announced that a car bomb had been defused, after which Savage's white Renault was towed from the car park by an army truck. The SAS personnel, meanwhile, left Gibraltar on a Royal Air Force aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of <b>the</b> <b>shootings,</b> Virginian governor Tim Kaine convened a panel consisting of various officials and experts to investigate and examine the response and handling of issues related to <b>the</b> <b>shootings.</b> The panel released its final report in August 2007, devoting more than 30 pages to detailing Cho's troubled history. In the report, the panel criticized {{the failure of the}} educators and mental health professionals who came into contact with Cho during his college years to notice his deteriorating condition and help him. The panel also criticized misinterpretations of privacy laws and gaps in Virginia's mental health system and gun laws. In addition, the panel faulted Virginia Tech administrators in particular for failing to take immediate action after the first shootings. Nevertheless, the report did acknowledge that Cho was still primarily responsible for not seeking assistance and for his murderous rampage.|$|E
5|$|Male {{students}} and staff expressed feelings of remorse for not having attempted to prevent <b>the</b> <b>shootings,</b> but Nathalie Provost, one of the survivors, said that she felt that nothing {{could have been done}} to prevent the tragedy, and that her fellow students should not feel guilty.|$|E

5|$|Other {{theories}} have been published, included allegations {{that not only}} that Luigi Longo, subsequently leader of the Communist Party in post-war Italy, but also Sandro Pertini, a future President of Italy, carried out <b>the</b> <b>shootings.</b> Others have claimed that Mussolini (or Mussolini and Petacci together) committed suicide with cyanide capsules.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish Red Cross, {{which had}} been quick to descend upon {{the scene in the}} {{immediate}} aftermath, said that some of the proceeds from its annual fund drive, which began two days after <b>the</b> <b>shootings,</b> would be contributed towards helping students and teachers affected by the incident. This would include financial provisions for the ongoing counselling services being provided.|$|E
5|$|The {{event has}} also been commemorated through {{references}} in television, theatre, and popular music. A play about <b>the</b> <b>shootings</b> by Adam Kelly called The Anorak was named {{as one of the}} best plays of 2004 by the Montreal Gazette. A movie entitled Polytechnique, directed by Denis Villeneuve was released in 2009, and sparked controversy over the desirability of reliving the tragedy in a commercial film.|$|E

5|$|Within {{days of the}} shooting, {{the police}} said they had {{received}} a sizeable number of tip-offs alerting them to suspicious photographs, videos, and comments on chat rooms.

5|$|A police {{van with}} two {{officers}} arrived {{a short time}} after <b>the</b> <b>shootings</b> began, at around 11:00. They entered the yard of the college where they were shot at by Saari, and forced to retreat. From around 11:45 to 12:00 further police units, bolstered {{by a number of}} armoured vehicles, began to arrive on the scene. They attempted to enter the building through the main corridor, but this assault was aborted due to the black smoke that was emanating from within the building.|$|E
5|$|After a time, Himmler {{found that}} the killing methods used by the Einsatzgruppen were inefficient: they were costly, demoralising for the troops, and {{sometimes}} did not kill the victims quickly enough. Many of the troops found the massacres to be difficult if not impossible to perform. Some of the perpetrators suffered {{physical and mental health}} problems, and many turned to drink. As much as possible, the Einsatzgruppen leaders militarized the genocide. The historian Christian Ingrao notes an attempt was made to make <b>the</b> <b>shootings</b> a collective act without individual responsibility. Framing <b>the</b> <b>shootings</b> in this way was not psychologically sufficient for every perpetrator to feel absolved of guilt. Browning notes three categories of potential perpetrators: those who were eager to participate right from the start, those who participated in spite of moral qualms because they were ordered to do so, and a significant minority who refused to take part. A few men spontaneously became excessively brutal in their killing methods and their zeal for the task. Commander of Einsatzgruppe D, SS-Gruppenführer Otto Ohlendorf, particularly noted this propensity towards excess, and ordered that any man who was too eager to participate or too brutal should not perform any further executions.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the events}} at Alkozai and Balandi, Bales handed himself over into ISAF custody. Afghan forces spotted him leaving his outpost before the killings and U.S. commanders on base {{assembled}} their troops for a head count {{when it was}} discovered that a soldier was missing. A patrol was dispatched to find the missing soldier, but did not find him before he returned to base after the killings. He was reportedly taken into custody without incident. There were no military operations being conducted in the area at the time of <b>the</b> <b>shootings.</b>|$|E
5|$|From late 1987, the British {{authorities}} {{were aware that}} the IRA was planning to detonate a bomb at {{the changing of the}} guard ceremony outside the governor's residence in the British Dependent Territory of Gibraltar. When Savage, McCann and Farrell—known IRA members—travelled to Spain in preparation for the attack, they were tracked {{at the request of the}} British government. On the day of <b>the</b> <b>shootings,</b> Savage was seen parking a white Renault in the car park used as the assembly area for the parade; McCann and Farrell were seen crossing the border shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|On August 15, 2011, {{there was}} more {{disruption}} in service at BART stations in downtown San Francisco.

Demonstrations were announced by several activists, which eventually resulted in disruptions to service. The protesters have stated {{that they did not}} want their protests to results in closures, and accused the BART police of using the protests as an excuse for disruption. Protesters vowed to continue their protests every Monday until their demands were met.|$|E
