5|$|In {{the sixth}} week of play, Vanderbilt beat the Alabama Crimson Tide 14–0 in Birmingham. The score {{reflected}} predictions, since the Commodores were favored by two touchdowns. Jess Neely {{played a role}} in each scoring drive. Early in the first quarter, Vanderbilt had the ball {{in the middle of the}} field after an Alabama punt. Two line bucks preceded Neely, who connected with <b>Tot</b> McCullough for a 30-yard pass play. Neely ran for an additional 17 yards, putting the ball on the nine-yard line. After a run by Godchaux, Lynn Bomar bucked over the line for the touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Louis Victor Wijnhamer {{was born}} on 11 February 1904 in Tegal, Central Java, in the Dutch East Indies. One of three siblings, Wijnhamer was born to an ethnic Dutch {{administrator}} from Surabaya, Louis Gregorius Wijnhamer and J. F. Ihnen; he was of Indo descent. He studied at the senior high school in Semarang, before spending some time at the Suikerschool in Surabaya, later arriving in Batavia (now Jakarta). There, between 1927 and 1937, he worked as an amanuensis at the School <b>tot</b> Opleiding van Inlandsche Artsen.|$|E

When McNary's mother died in 1878, his father moved the family to Salem where he bought a general merchandise store after being unable to run the family farm because of declining health. Charles, known as <b>Tot,</b> began his education at a one-room school in Keizer and later attended Central School in Salem, living on North Commercial Street. Hugh McNary died in 1883, making Charlie an orphan at the age of nine.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{veterans}} included Neely, Frank Godchaux, Doc Kuhn, <b>Tot</b> McCullough, Pink Wade, Alvin Bell, Alf Sharpe, and Percy Conyers. Godchaux was {{the first}} player to follow in his father's footsteps as a Vanderbilt football player. Captain Pink Wade, father of future Vanderbilt quarterback Bill Wade, moved from fullback to guard. Tackle Tex Bradford had played for Texas Christian University for two years; after sitting out a year at Vanderbilt, he was eligible to play for the Commodores.|$|E
5|$|The station {{building}} in Winschoten {{was completed in}} 1865. The third part of Staatslijn B between Groningen and Winschoten was opened on 1 May 1868.

5|$|Vanderbilt's record against Georgia was 6–1; {{its only}} loss was 4–0, in 1898, and the all-time score was 184–4 {{in favor of}} the Commodores. The Bulldogs were favored to win their first meeting since 1912. In the first quarter, both teams were evenly matched. The Commodores had their best chance to score when Thomas Ryan beat the defense, but he dropped Neely's pass. Vanderbilt also had a chance to score when a Georgia field goal was blocked by Lynn Bomar and picked up by <b>Tot</b> McCullough, who was caught from behind before he could score.|$|E
5|$|Georgia coach Herman Stegeman, in {{the section}} on Southern {{football}} in Spalding's football guide, wrote that Vanderbilt had a good year {{but was unable to}} play up to its full capabilities and the Commodores should prepare for a fine season the next year. For Stegeman, the contest for the theoretical title of greatest Southern team in 1921 was between Centre, Georgia Tech, and Georgia. Clyde Berryman retroactively listed Vanderbilt as national champion. Lynn Bomar at fullback, Pos Elam at tackle, and Thomas Ryan at end were listed on Walter Camp's list of notable players. Bomar, Elam, Ryan, <b>Tot</b> McCullough, Alf Sharpe, and Pink Wade all made an All-Southern team although, according to the yearbook, Tom Ryan was the only player in the group to appear on an All-Southern team.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{significant}} difference in the amount of <b>TOTs</b> experienced by monolinguals and bilinguals. Bilinguals seem to report the same amount of <b>TOTs</b> as monolinguals for proper names but significantly more <b>TOTs</b> for other words. Specifically, when adjusted for the degree of use of the dominant and less-dominant language, bilinguals have more <b>TOTs</b> with the less-dominant language. In a task of picture-naming, bilingual speakers were slower than monolinguals, even when they could use their first and dominant language. This could possibly be the result of bilinguals using the words less often than monolingual speakers.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} and documentation is an analysis and instructive guide for conducting {{a public relations}} campaign to promote the Nipomo Toys for <b>Tots</b> Drive.

With the recent downturn of the economy, the media will be instrumental in furthering the Toys for <b>Tots</b> mission and purpose to collect an estimated 3, 000 toy donations for Nipomo children (newborns to 16 years of age). Although the 2008 Nipomo Toys for <b>Tots</b> Drive was successful without the presence of media coverage, the recent economic downturn may limit the number of donations for the 2009 charity drive.

5|$|In 1904, {{the station}} {{building}} was expanded with a porch and additional waiting room. From 1938 to 2000, train services {{were provided by}} the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (Netherlands Railways), when the Maatschappij <b>tot</b> Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen merged with the Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg-Maatschappij (Hollandic Iron Railroad Company). In 1942, during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, approximately 500 Jews from Winschoten were transported by train to the Westerbork transit camp {{and from there to}} Nazi concentration camps in Germany and Poland, where 446 of them were killed. As a result of the war, the German border at the railway was closed for passenger transport from 1944 to 1954. In 1967, the roofed bus station was built next to the station building. In {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century, the station building's porch was replaced.|$|E
5|$|The Baptists had {{sustained}} {{injuries in}} its opening {{game against the}} Georgia Bulldogs, and their practice schedule was hampered by rain. Near {{the end of the}} first quarter, Godchaux finally got off a good punt to Mercer's 10-yard line and Tom Ryan made the tackle. Godchaux returned Mercer's punt ten yards, beginning a drive gaining six yards off-tackle. On the next play Doc Kuhn passed to <b>Tot</b> McCullough for twelve yards and first down on the nine-yard line. Rupert Smith ran to the five-yard line, and then to the two. Red Williams fumbled on the next play, but it was recovered by Alf Sharpe in the end zone.|$|E
5|$|From September 1939 a more easterly Main Defence Line (MDL) was constructed. This second main {{defensive}} position had {{a northern}} part {{formed by the}} Grebbelinie (Grebbe line), located at {{the foothills of the}} Utrechtse Heuvelrug, an Ice Age moraine between Lake IJssel and the Lower Rhine. It was dug on instigation of the commander of the Field Army Lieutenant-General Jan Joseph Godfried baron van Voorst <b>tot</b> Voorst. This line was extended by a southern part: the Peel-Raamstelling (Peel-Raam Position), located between the river Maas and the Belgian border along the Peel Marshes and the Raam rivulet, as ordered by the Dutch Commander in Chief, General Izaak H. Reijnders. In the south the intention was to delay the Germans as much as possible to cover a French advance. Fourth and Second Army Corps were positioned at the Grebbe Line; Third Army Corps were stationed at the Peel-Raam Position with the Light Division behind it to cover its southern flank. Brigade A and B were positioned between the Lower Rhine and the Maas. First Army Corps was a strategic reserve in the Fortress Holland, the southern perimeter of which was manned by another ten battalions and the eastern by six battalions. All these lines were reinforced by pillboxes.|$|E

5|$|In July 1780 Adams {{replaced}} Laurens as {{the ambassador}} to the Dutch Republic, {{then one of the}} few other republics in the world. With the aid of the Dutch Patriot leader Joan van der Capellen <b>tot</b> den Pol, Adams secured the recognition of the United States as an independent government at The Hague on April 19, 1782. In February 1782 the Frisian states was the first Dutch province to recognize the United States, while France had been the first European country to grant diplomatic recognition in 1778. He also negotiated a loan of five million guilders financed by Nicolaas van Staphorst and Wilhelm Willink. By 1794 a total of eleven loans were granted in Amsterdam to the United States with a value of 29 million guilders. In October 1782, he negotiated with the Dutch a treaty of amity and commerce, the first such treaty between the United States and a foreign power following the 1778 treaty with France. The house that Adams bought during this stay in The Netherlands became the first American-owned embassy on foreign soil.|$|E
5|$|Quarterback Doc Kuhn {{started the}} second half after sitting out the first because of injuries, invigorating the Commodores. The second scoring drive started when Paul Stumb intercepted a pass. Neely ran for 21 yards around the right end before Kuhn {{connected}} with <b>Tot</b> McCullough for a 25-yard pass. Rupe Smith (or Kuhn) then ran the remaining few yards for the touchdown. Alabama {{had a chance to}} score, making it to Vanderbilt's 18-yard line. The Commodore defense prevailed, Alabama's forward passes failed, and the ball went over on downs. Other chances included Alabama halfback Rosenfeld intercepting a pass with a clear field ahead of him, returning it 32 yards before Vanderbilt's Red Rountree tackled him from behind. Alabama back Charles Bartlett also returned a punt 25 yards before he was tackled by the last Commodore who could have done so. The Crimson Tide was captained by sophomore end Al Clemens, later captain of the first Alabama team coached by Wallace Wade.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 All-Africa Games {{represented}} a double landmark victory for Zersenay: {{he became the}} first Eritrean medallist in the competition's history, and won his first ever gold medal on the track, sealing victory in the 10,000 m final with a Games record time of 27:00.30. The following month he competed at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics, and he edged closer to a podium finish – he led the 10,000 m race up to the 8km mark, setting a fast pace, but ultimately ended up in fourth position. Preparing for the road championships that year, he ran the 10-mile Dam <b>tot</b> Damloop race in September and won in 45:51 (the world's fastest that season), finishing some distance ahead of runners up Bernard Kipyego and James Rotich. Zersenay emphasised his position as one of the world's most dominant half marathon runners with a second victory at the 2007 IAAF World Road Running Championships in Udine, Italy. Although he was close to world record pace at the 15km point, he slowed behind the leading pack of Makau Musyoki, Evans Kiprop Cheruiyot and Deriba Merga. In the final kilometre, he burst away to take the lead and the gold medal, setting a national and championship record time of 58:59 in the process. Following these achievements, a medical team did a study of his running economy and found him {{to be one of the}} most efficient runners ever to be tested.|$|E

40|$|In a {{longitudinal}} study, auditory and visual temporal order thresholds (<b>TOTs)</b> were investigated in primary school children (N = 236; mean {{age at first}} data point = 6; 7) {{at the beginning of}} Grade 1 and the end of Grade 2 to test whether rapid temporal processing abilities predict reading and spelling at the end of Grades 1 and 2.

Visual <b>TOTs</b> were not predictive of literacy measures; auditory <b>TOTs</b> in Grade 1 were the best predictor. Interestingly, they were related to spelling in Grade 2 while auditory <b>TOTs</b> in Grade 2 were not, suggesting that rapid auditory processing abilities have a causal influence on literacy development. Developmental dyslexia is a specific impairment in learning to read, which does not reflect a general cognitive impairment, and does not result from sen-sory deficits and/or inadequate schooling (Ameri-can Psychiatric Association, 1994; Shaywitz, 1998).

25|$|Research on priming and {{practice}} use single word tests to assess {{for the presence}} of <b>TOT</b> states. The first letter of the target word or a similar-sounding word is given in order to prime for the target word. Evidence that comes from the usefulness of priming {{and practice}} in reducing <b>TOT</b> states is that most information in <b>TOT</b> states is low-frequency; that is, it has not been used or recalled for some time. The recency of information use can influence the retrieval process of that information. The presentation of a prime is only needed once for it to facilitate <b>TOT</b> state resolution. Support for priming has been found in that when individuals are given the first letter of the word they are trying to recall, {{they are more likely to}} overcome their <b>TOT</b> state. When the prime is a related word instead of the first letter, an interesting effect occurs: When the prime word has similar phonology to the target word, an increase in the frequency of <b>TOT</b> states and a higher frequency of correctly recalled words when the <b>TOT</b> state is resolved is observed. Incorrect words come to mind involuntarily that share similar phonological features with the target word. Thus, phonological similarity can both decrease and increase <b>TOT</b> states. However, it is possible to fix this problem by changing the syntactic class of the priming word. Priming words that are in the same syntactic class as the target word create no difference in <b>TOT</b> state resolution. The <b>TOT</b> state resolution was the same for priming words in the same syntactic class and unrelated priming words. If the priming word is being listed in conjunction with other unrelated priming words, then the position is of importance. The earlier in the list the priming word is, the less likely it is to help resolve the <b>TOT</b> state.|$|E
25|$|The metacognitive {{perspective}} views <b>TOT</b> states {{simply as}} the awareness felt when such an event occurs {{and the perception of}} the experience involved. Mainly being aware of a <b>TOT</b> state can result in the rapid devotion of cognitive resources to resolving the state and successfully retrieving the word from memory. Such an explanation leaves much to be desired; however, the psycholinguistic perspective and the metacognitive perspective on <b>TOT</b> states are not mutually exclusive and both are used to observe <b>TOT</b> states in a laboratory setting.|$|E
