50|$|The {{finished}} Brandtaucher, {{built by}} August Howaldt {{of the later}} Howaldtswerke was 28 feet long, weighing about 70,000 pounds. As at that time no suitable mechanical power system was available the submarine was powered by two sailors turning a big <b>tread</b> <b>wheel</b> with their hands and feet. The third crew member, the captain, was positioned at {{the stern of the}} submarine. His job was to operate the rudders and other controls. Having arrived under the target ship the captain would reach out through a gutta percha (rubber) glove fixed to an opening of the hull, grab the mine located within reach on the hull of the submarine and fix it on the target.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} results of a {{theoretical}} study of profile high-speed grinding (PHSG) for forming <b>tread</b> <b>wheel</b> sets during repair instead of turning and mold-milling. Significant disadvantages of these methods are low capacity to adapt to the tool and inhomogeneous structure of the wheel material. This leads to understated treatment regimens and difficulties in recovering wheel sets with thermal and mechanical defects. This study carried out modeling and analysis of emerging cutting forces. Proposed algorithms describe the random occurrence of the components of the cutting forces in the restoration profile of wheel sets with an inhomogeneous structure of the material. To identify the statistical features of randomly generated structures fractal dimension and the method of random additions were used. The multifractal spectrum formed is decomposed into monofractals by wavelet transform. The proposed method allows you to create the preconditions for controlling the parameters of the treatment process...|$|E

40|$|Wheel fatigue – the {{formation}} of cracks on <b>wheel</b> <b>tread,</b> in <b>wheel</b> rim or on the wheel disk, is a crucial phenomenon in assuring safe and reliable rail transportations. In the current chapter a background to the phenomenon is given. The appearance and mechanisms of different forms of wheel fatigue are discussed and predictive models are presented.

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of railway wheels to {{wear and}} rolling contact fatigue damage {{is influenced by}} the properties of the wheel material (microstructure and hardness). These properties are influenced by the steel composition, wheel manufacturing process, and by the stresses experienced during operation. The in-service properties can therefore vary with depth below the surface, and with position across the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread.</b> This paper discusses the stress history at the wheel/rail contact (derived from dynamic simulations) and the variation in hardness and microstructure with depth from the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> (measured on <b>wheels</b> removed from service). The results are linked to the observed rolling contact fatigue resistance of railway wheels...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tread</b> braked railway <b>wheels</b> are {{subjected}} to complex loading due to combined rolling contact stresses and thermally induced stresses. The main objective {{of the present study}} is to find the limits for tread braking with respect to temperature impact on rolling contact fatigue (RCF) of the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread.</b> A <b>wheel</b> with an S-shaped web is studied for some different stop braking loads. Using 3 D FE simulations, the effects of simultaneous thermal loading from braking and mechanical loading, with traversing wheel-rail rolling contact, are studied. In order to account for the elevated temperatures, the simulations utilise a temperature-dependent elastoplastic material model. The mechanical loads account for frictional rolling contact stress distributions induced by braking, using a novel method that is based on elastoplastic contact simulations. Partial slip is considered and interfacial shear stresses are introduced in the wheel-rail contact area. Evolution of damage {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> is studied for various brake loading cases. In order to assess limits for the tread braking, the calculated damage is compared to previously developed critical damage levels which were based on full-scale brake rig testing. Results are presented for a parametric study with thermomechanical loading based on different load cases. The influence from operational parameters such as axle loads, initial speeds, decelerations and block material is studied. The results show that the temperature has a strong influence on the rolling contact fatigue of the <b>wheel</b> <b>treads</b> and, hence, also on the thermal capacity of the wheels. The study gives preliminary limits for revenue traffic, described as combinations of tread temperatures and wheel-rail rolling contact loading, which should be respected to avoid thermal cracking of the <b>wheel</b> <b>treads...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{cracking}} of railway <b>wheel</b> <b>treads</b> is investigated using {{a combined}} experimental and numerical approach. Results from controlled brake rig tests of repeated stop braking cycles for a railway wheel in rolling {{contact with a}} so-called railwheel are presented. Test conditions are then numerically analysed using finite element (FE) simulations that account for the thermomechanical loading of the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread.</b> For the studied stop braking case, thermal cracks {{are found in the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> after few brake cycles. Results from thermal imaging reveal a frictionally excited thermoelastic instability phenomenon called "banding" where the contact between brake block and wheel occurs only over a fraction of the block width. This condition results in locally high temperatures. The numerical analysis assesses ratcheting response of the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> material under operational conditions corresponding to two types of banding patterns and also a case of uniform heating. Fatigue life predictions are estimated from the evaluated ratcheting response using a simplified accumulation rule. Predicted lives are found to be in reasonable agreement with experimental results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Upon {{investigation}} of the damaged wheels {{it was determined that}} the cracking was caused by thermal fatigue during on-tread friction braking. The thermal cracks appear as short cracks oriented axially on the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread.</b> Severe heating of the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> during braking was believed to be a contributing the variation of residual stress which is related to wheel failure. It is necessary to evaluate the residual stress due to deterioration of <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> in order {{to ensure the safety of}} wheel. In the present paper, the residual stress of railway wheel for deterioration using x-ray diffraction system is evaluated. The result shows that the residual stress of wheel is depend on the running distance and the residual stress needs to be inspected between the wheel diameter of 800 and 780 mm...|$|R
40|$|Roughness (corrugation, waviness) on {{the tread}} of a rolling railway wheel leads to {{vibrations}} in wheels, bogies and superstructure {{and also in}} rails, sleepers and roadbed. These vibrating components radiate noise to the surroundings. A lowering of the noise levels from tread braked freight cars is of utmost importance {{for the future of}} rail traffic. The thermomechanical interaction between brake block and <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> during braking has been found to cause hot spots on the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread.</b> This phenomenon is believed to be a main contributor {{to the development of a}} wavy tread surface. Due to thermal expansion of the rim material, the hot spots will protrude from the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> and be more exposed to wear during the wheel/block contact than the rest of the tread surface. The non-even wear results in roughness on the <b>tread</b> of the <b>wheel</b> after cooling. In the present paper, a theoretical and numerical model of the interaction between wheel rim and brake block has been developed. Simulations with this model demonstrate the principal phenomena occurring at the wheel/block contact. Furthermore, results from field measurements of wheel roughness are presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{wheelset}} {{maintenance cost}} {{is an important}} part of train maintenance cost. Researchers and railway operators have been closely concerned about the way to minimize residual stress at <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> and surface roughness during wheel reprofiling, thereby reducing the wheel damage during operation, extending the wheelset service life, and cutting down wheelset maintenance cost. The present study involves dynamic simulation of tread reprofiling process by building a finite element model of wheel reprofiling, taking the wheel steel as research object. This paper makes a comprehensive analysis of surface roughness and residual stress distribution of <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> under different milling parameters. The simulation results indicate that the increase in cutting speed and back cutting depth causes the chip morphology to change while impairing the machined surface quality. Once serrated chip occurs, it means <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> machining quality deteriorates remarkably. In this way, the paper associates macroscopic chip morphology with microcosmic surface roughness and internal residual stress to provide theoretical basis for optimization of wheel reprofiling process...|$|R

50|$|If, {{however, the}} {{wheelset}} is displaced to one side, the diameters of {{the regions of}} contact, and hence the tangential velocities of the wheels at the running surfaces are different and the wheelset tends to steer back towards the centre. Also, when the train encounters an unbanked turn, the wheelset displaces laterally slightly, so that the outer <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> speeds up linearly, and the inner <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> slows down, causing the train to turn the corner.
