5|$|<b>The</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> secretes {{a number}} of {{different}} hormones which are metabolised by enzymes either within the gland or {{in other parts of the}} body. These hormones are involved in {{a number of}} essential biological functions.|$|E
5|$|Catecholamine {{release is}} {{stimulated by the}} {{activation}} of the sympathetic nervous system. Splanchnic nerves of the sympathetic nervous system innervate the medulla of <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland.</b> When activated, it evokes the release of catecholamines from the storage granules by stimulating the opening of calcium channels in the cell membrane.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> {{are located}} above the kidneys in humans {{and in front}} of the kidneys in other animals. <b>The</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> (also known as suprarenal glands) are {{endocrine}} glands that produce a variety of hormones including adrenaline and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol.|$|R
5000|$|... 11-Ketodihydrotestosterone (11-KDHT), {{also known}} as 5α-androstan-17β-ol-3,11-dione, is an endogenous, {{naturally}} occurring steroid and androgen prohormone that is produced primarily, if not exclusively, in <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands.</b> It {{is closely related to}} 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione (11β-KA4), adrenosterone (11-ketoandrostenedione; 11-KA4), and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), which are also produced in <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the normal}} situation, ACTH is {{released}} from the pituitary gland {{at the base of}} the brain. It acts on <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> to stimulate <b>the</b> production of steroid hormones (glucocorticoids). If <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> are healthy, a single injection of tetracosactide results in a rise in blood cortisol (hydrocortisone) concentrations in 30 minutes. If <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> appear not to be working then tetracosactide injection can be given to check whether the problem is due to diseased or damaged adrenals or due to lack of pituitary ACTH.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{endocrine}} diseases involve dysfunctions of <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland.</b> Overproduction of cortisol leads to Cushing's syndrome, whereas insufficient production {{is associated with}} Addison's disease. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disease produced by dysregulation of endocrine control mechanisms. A variety of tumors can arise from adrenal tissue and are commonly found in medical imaging when searching for other diseases.|$|E
5|$|Addison's disease {{refers to}} primary hypoadrenalism, {{which is a}} {{deficiency}} in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland.</b> In the Western world, Addison's disease is most commonly an autoimmune condition, in which the body produces antibodies against cells of the adrenal cortex. Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis. A distinctive feature of Addison's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.|$|E
5|$|The normal {{function}} of <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> may be impaired by {{conditions such as}} infections, tumors, genetic disorders and autoimmune diseases, or as {{a side effect of}} medical therapy. These disorders affect the gland either directly (as with infections or autoimmune diseases) or {{as a result of the}} dysregulation of hormone production (as in some types of Cushing's syndrome) leading to an excess or insufficiency of adrenal hormones and the related symptoms.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> {{are located}} {{on both sides of}} the body in the retroperitoneum, above and {{slightly}} medial to the kidneys. In humans, <b>the</b> right <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> is pyramidal in shape, whereas the left is semilunar or crescent shaped and somewhat larger. <b>The</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> measure approximately 3.0cm in width, 5.0cm in length, and up to 1.0cm in thickness. Their combined weight in an adult human ranges from 7 to 10grams. The glands are yellowish in colour.|$|R

5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland,</b> from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> secretes a basal {{level of}} {{cortisol}} {{but can also}} produce bursts of the hormone in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary. Cortisol is not evenly released during the day – its concentrations in the blood are highest {{in the early morning}} and lowest in the evening {{as a result of the}} circadian rhythm of ACTH secretion. Cortisone is an inactive product of the action of the enzyme 11β-HSD on cortisol. The reaction catalyzed by 11β-HSD is reversible, which means that it can turn administered cortisone into cortisol, the biologically active hormone.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{composed}} of two heterogenous types of tissue. In the center is the adrenal medulla, which produces adrenaline and noradrenaline and releases them into the bloodstream, {{as part of the}} sympathetic nervous system. Surrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a variety of steroid hormones. These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal development paths. The cortex of <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> is derived from mesoderm, whereas the medulla is derived from the neural crest, which is of ectodermal origin.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> are {{surrounded}} by a fatty capsule and lie within the renal fascia, which also surrounds the kidneys. A weak wall of connective tissue separates the glands from <b>the</b> kidneys. <b>The</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> are directly below the diaphragm, and {{are attached to the}} crura of the diaphragm by the renal fascia.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe left <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> is best visualized using {{endoscopic}} ultrasound (EUS) {{from a position}} in the upper body of the stomach, whereas <b>the</b> right <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> may easily be examined using transabdominal ultrasound. <b>The</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> have a ‘seagull’ configuration, with a body and two long wings. Sonographically, five layers of <b>the</b> <b>adrenals</b> may be distinguished. Mass lesions are incidentally found in up to 5 % of patients, only 15 – 20 % of these ‘incidentalomas’ being clinically relevant.

5|$|Thehuman genomeincludes {{approximately}} 20,000 protein coding {{genes and}} 70% of thesegenes are expressedin the normal, adult adrenal glands.Only some 250 genes are more specifically {{expressed in the}} adrenal glands compared to other organs and tissues.The adrenal gland specific genes with highest level of expression include members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. Corresponding proteins are expressed in the different compartments of <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland,</b> such as CYP11A1, HSD3B2 and FDX1 involved in steroid hormone synthesis and expressed in cortical cell layers, and PNMT and DBH involved in noradrenalin and adrenalin synthesis and expressed in the medulla.|$|E
5|$|In poor conditions, {{the weight}} of <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> may {{increase}} up to 200%, and rice rats are unable to conserve water well when dehydrated, and in water contaminated with oil, they swim less and their mortality increases. The median amount of radiation needed to kill a marsh rice rat is 5.25Gy and the lethal dose of potassium cyanide is 7.20mg/kg; both values are relatively low for cricetid rodents. In one study, wild rice rats in radioactively contaminated areas did not show signs of disease. Exposure to more daylight and higher food availability cause increased development of the gonads in both adult and juvenile rice rats. When the pineal gland is removed or melatonin is administered in male rice rats, the testes are reduced and tend to regress into the body.|$|E
5|$|Mutations in the PRKACA {{gene that}} promote {{abnormal}} enzyme activity {{have been linked}} to disease of <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland.</b> Several mutations in PRKACA have been found in patients with Cushing’s syndrome that result in an increase in the ability of PKA to broadly phosphorylate other proteins. One mutation in the PRKACA gene that causes an amino acid substitution of leucine to arginine in position 206, was found in over 60% of patients with adrenocortical tumors. Other mutations and genetic alterations in the PRKACA gene have been identified in adrenocortical adenomas that also disrupt PKA signaling, leading to aberrant PKA phosphorylation. The Cα gene has also been incriminated in a variety of cancers, including colon, renal, rectal, prostate, lung, breast, adrenal carcinomas and lymphomas.|$|E

5000|$|The {{condition}} was initially considered {{a form of}} anemia associated with <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands.</b> Because little was known at the time about <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> (then called [...] "Supra-Renal Capsules"), Addison’s monograph describing the {{condition was}} an isolated insight. As <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> function became better known, Addison’s monograph became known as an important medical contribution and {{a classic example of}} careful medical observation.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> {{produces}} aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, {{which is}} important in the regulation of salt ("mineral") balance and blood volume. In the kidneys, aldosterone acts on the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates. Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Angiotensin II and extracellular potassium are the two main regulators of aldosterone production. The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences blood pressure. Therefore, the effects of aldosterone in sodium retention are important for the regulation of blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{layers of}} <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> differ by function, with each layer having {{distinct}} enzymes that produce different hormones {{from a common}} precursor. The first enzymatic step {{in the production of}} all steroid hormones is cleavage of the cholesterol side chain, a reaction that forms pregnenolone as a product and is catalyzed by the enzyme P450scc, also known as cholesterol desmolase. After the production of pregnenolone, specific enzymes of each cortical layer further modify it. Enzymes involved in this process include both mitochondrial and microsomal P450s and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. Usually a number of intermediate steps in which pregnenolone is modified several times are required to form the functional hormones. Enzymes that catalyze reactions in these metabolic pathways are involved in a number of endocrine diseases. For example, {{the most common form of}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia develops as a result of deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in an intermediate step of cortisol production.|$|E
