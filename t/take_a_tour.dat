5|$|Yosemite Valley is open year-round and {{numerous}} activities {{are available through}} the National Park Service, Yosemite Conservancy, and Delaware North at Yosemite, including nature walks, photography and art classes, stargazing programs, tours, bike rentals, rafting, mule and horseback rides, and rock climbing classes. Many people enjoy short walks and longer hikes to waterfalls in Yosemite Valley, or walks among giant sequoias in the Mariposa, Tuolumne, or Merced Groves. Others like to drive or <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>tour</b> bus to Glacier Point (summer–fall) to see a spectacular view of Yosemite Valley and the high country, or drive along the scenic Tioga Road to Tuolumne Meadows (May–October) {{and go for a}} walk or hike.|$|E
5|$|Also {{close to}} the 35thparallel was the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Its opening in the early 1880s led to the {{founding}} of towns like Holbrook and Adamana. Visitors could stop at the Adamana train station, book a hotel room, and <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>tour</b> of what was then called the Chalcedony Forest. Over the years, the line changed hands, becoming the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and then the BNSF. More than 60 BNSF trains, mostly carrying freight, pass through the park every day. U.S. Route66, a former transcontinental auto highway developed in 1926 from part of the National Old Trails Road, ran parallel to the railroad tracks until it was decommissioned in 1985. The park has preserved within its boundaries a small grassy section of the road. Interstate40, which crosses the park, replaced the older highway.|$|E
5|$|The second {{controversy}} arose as {{a result}} of the renovation of the governor's mansion. Kentucky first lady Phyllis George Brown created the Save the Mansion Fund to help cover the costs of the renovation. When the renovation was complete, she planned a nine-day showcase of the mansion for the general public. Guests were charged $10 to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>tour</b> of the mansion. Legislator Eugene P. Stuart objected to taxpayers being charged a fee to view a mansion their tax dollars supported. He asked Beshear to protest the charge, and Beshear requested an injunction against the Save the Mansion Fund. A Lexington judge refused to grant the injunction, and Beshear appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which upheld the lower court's decision. Beshear's actions caused a rift between him and Governor John Y. Brown, Jr.|$|E

5|$|Leslie, Tom (Aziz Ansari), and Jerry join Carl to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>tour</b> of {{the park}} where Jerry was mugged. Carl says the area is largely {{unprotected}} due to budget cuts, so Leslie vows to get more funding. She appears on Pawnee Today, the local news show, saying the Pawnee government failed the parks and that security is poor. Paul (Phil Reeves), the city manager, is angry over the television appearance, but informs Leslie the stunt worked and the mayor is offering $2,500 to help fix the park. While {{at a press conference}} about the money, Jerry confesses to Leslie that he wasn't mugged: he dropped a breakfast burrito in a creek, then fell while trying to grab it and dislocated his shoulder. He fabricated the mugger story because he was embarrassed and didn't want everyone to make fun of him. Leslie angrily relates Jerry's story to Mark, but he stops her short when he says that Jerry was too scared of his co-workers to be honest with them. Leslie soon discovers Carl was offended by Leslie's statements about park security and plans to show footage of Jerry falling into the creek on Pawnee Today. Leslie negotiates with Carl to not show the event, and instead they talk during the show about how much they enjoyed the film Avatar, much to the anger of host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins). As part of their deal to not show the tape, Leslie buys Carl a brand new security cart. Carl hands over the tape, which she agrees to throw away after she watches it one last time. The office goes back to mocking Jerry, but with less venom than before, while Jerry confides that he doesn't really care because he's just two years away from retiring on a full pension and enjoying a peaceful retirement.|$|E

Unlike most of the others, however, he decided to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>tour</b> of the South, and applied for {{a leave of absence}} in 1863. By his own admission, his initial sympathies lay with the Union, due to his natural distaste for slavery. But as stated in his own book, in the Preface: On 2 March 1863, Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle left England on board the mail steamer, Atrato.|$|E
