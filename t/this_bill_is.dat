500|$|The {{albatrosses}} are a {{group of}} large to very large birds; they are {{the largest of the}} procellariiformes. The bill is large, strong and sharp-edged, the upper mandible terminating in a large hook. <b>This</b> <b>bill</b> <b>is</b> composed of several horny plates, and along the sides are the two [...] "tubes", long nostrils that give the order its former name. The tubes of all albatrosses are along the sides of the bill, unlike the rest of the Procellariiformes where the tubes run {{along the top of the}} bill. These tubes allow the albatrosses to measure the exact airspeed in flight; the nostrils are analogous to the pitot tubes in modern aircraft. The albatross needs accurate airspeed measurement in order to perform dynamic soaring. Like other Procellariiformes, they use their uniquely developed sense of smell to locate potential food sources, whereas most birds depend on eyesight. The feet have no hind toe and the three anterior toes are completely webbed. The legs are strong for Procellariiformes, making them and the giant petrels the only members of that order which can walk well on land.|$|E
