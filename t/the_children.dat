5|$|According to a survivor, Nada Požega from Slavonia, <b>the</b> <b>children</b> {{were forced}} {{to go to church}} to pray, and were {{required}} to greet others with the Ustaše greeting Spremni (Ready) or the Nazi salute Heil Hitler. Those children that failed to do so were punished by the Ustaše guards with either a beating or solitary confinement. Požega further stated the nuns did not treat <b>the</b> <b>children</b> with sympathy or care. Another survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, recalled that the barracks were fenced with barbed wire, and that they slept on the floor covered with straw. He stated that the Ustaše tried to convert <b>the</b> <b>children</b> to Catholicism. He personally feared a nun, Sister Mercedes, but all <b>the</b> <b>children</b> feared Pulherija.|$|E
5|$|Another survivor, Radomir Krnjajić, {{recalled}} {{that they were}} fed a variety of foods, including pumpkin soup, cucumbers, beets and similar vegetables, and sometimes received a little macaroni or beans, but very little bread. The historian Ivan Fumić concludes that <b>the</b> <b>children</b> were systematically punished for various infractions, and were treated harshly by the Ustaše {{and the majority of}} the nuns. Some of the nuns at the camp, however, did show love and attention to <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> Gojko Knežević, another camp survivor, recounted many years later that the nuns beat <b>the</b> <b>children</b> with birch branches dipped in salt water or vinegar.|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having <b>the</b> <b>children</b> go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which <b>the</b> <b>children</b> constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for <b>the</b> <b>children,</b> it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{impending}} divorce, Farrar initially declined {{to move out}} of the family home. He was concerned that Green, who had never been a heavy drinker of alcohol, was suddenly consuming large quantities of it while supervising <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> Though Green continued her routine of ferrying <b>the</b> <b>children</b> to after-school activities, she would spend her evenings drinking at home, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness and nearly always until she lost what inhibitions she had left about her language in front of <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> On one occasion, Farrar was called home from work by <b>the</b> <b>children,</b> who had found their mother unresponsive. Green had disappeared from the home by the time Farrar arrived there, and though he eventually discovered that she had been hiding in the basement while he searched for her, she claimed at the time to have been wandering the town, hoping to be hit by a car. Farrar moved out of the family home in early autumn due to concerns about his personal safety.|$|E

5|$|Lukić {{notes that}} the {{mortality}} rate among <b>the</b> <b>children</b> at Jastrebarsko was much {{lower than that of}} children at Stara Gradiška and Sisak for two reasons. Firstly, that almost half <b>the</b> <b>children</b> at Jastrebarsko were older children more able to cope with the harsh conditions. More importantly, that from the end of July, twenty-six volunteer nurses from the teachers' school at Rude near Samobor, along with several doctors and other medical personnel, under the leadership of Marinić, began to intervene with the camp administration and Ustaše guards to improve the health of <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> The Ustaše propaganda soon took advantage of the improved condition of <b>the</b> <b>children.</b>|$|E
50|$|Family tracing can be {{initiated}} upon {{the request of}} <b>the</b> <b>child</b> or on <b>the</b> initiative of the authorities. Informed consent of <b>the</b> <b>child</b> and <b>the</b> <b>child’s</b> views about family tracing should be heard prior to initiating the process. If <b>the</b> <b>child</b> is against family tracing, the dialogue with <b>the</b> <b>child</b> should be sought to understand <b>the</b> <b>child’s</b> position. Family tracing shall only be conducted when it {{is considered to be}} {{in the best interests of}} <b>the</b> <b>child.</b> This means that tracing and restoring the family ties is expected not to cause <b>the</b> <b>child</b> or <b>the</b> family any harm or other adverse effects.|$|R
50|$|To {{establish}} {{a good relationship}} with a <b>child</b> and <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> family, child groomers might do several things: They might try to gain <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> or parents' trust by befriending them, with the goal of easy access to <b>the</b> <b>child.</b> A trusting relationship with the family means <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> parents are less likely to believe potential accusations. Child groomers might look for opportunities to have time alone with <b>the</b> <b>child,</b> which can be done by offering to babysit; the groomers may also invite <b>the</b> <b>child</b> for sleepovers, for opportunistic bed sharing. They might give gifts or money to <b>the</b> <b>child</b> in exchange for sexual contact, or for no apparent reason. Commonly, they show pornography to <b>the</b> <b>child,</b> or talk about sexual topics with <b>the</b> <b>child,</b> hoping to make it easy for <b>the</b> <b>child</b> to accept such acts, thus normalizing the behavior. Hugging and kissing or other physical contact, even when <b>the</b> <b>child</b> does not want it, can happen.|$|R

5000|$|In the Reggio approach, {{the teacher}} is {{considered}} a co-learner and collaborator with <b>the</b> <b>child</b> and not just an instructor. Teachers are encouraged to facilitate <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> learning by planning activities and lessons based on <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> interests, asking questions to further understanding, and actively engaging in the activities alongside <b>the</b> <b>child,</b> instead of passively observing <b>the</b> <b>child</b> learning.

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} if one stole from one's father and, when charged by the father, denied it on oath, and the father then died before <b>the</b> <b>child</b> confessed to <b>the</b> father's heirs, then <b>the</b> <b>child</b> would have to repay the {{principal}} and a fifth to <b>the</b> father's other <b>children</b> or to <b>the</b> father's brothers (<b>the</b> <b>child's</b> uncles) if <b>the</b> <b>child</b> had no siblings. But if <b>the</b> <b>child</b> was unwilling to forfeit <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> share in <b>the</b> payment that <b>child</b> had to make, or if <b>the</b> <b>child</b> had no resources, then <b>the</b> <b>child</b> was to borrow the amount from others and perform the duty of restoration to the heirs, and the creditors could subsequently come and demand to be paid the portion that would by law have belonged to <b>the</b> <b>child</b> as heir..|$|R
50|$|There are {{two goals}} in Floortime: (1) follow <b>the</b> <b>child’s</b> lead, and (2) bring <b>the</b> <b>child</b> into a shared world. To follow <b>the</b> <b>child’s</b> lead means {{to take the}} cue from <b>the</b> <b>child,</b> because a <b>child’s</b> {{interests}} are <b>the</b> window to his/her emotional life. From there, we can join <b>the</b> <b>child</b> in a shared world. The rationale here is that a child feels closer to someone who shows respect for <b>the</b> <b>child’s</b> interests and participates in them. Once a child enjoys having us participate with him/her, we can then begin to help <b>the</b> <b>child</b> toward greater development. Floortime leads us in going beyond by challenging <b>the</b> <b>child</b> to master each developmental level; it requires our attention to <b>the</b> <b>child’s</b> nervous system and individual processing abilities, to our own personalities and reactions to <b>the</b> <b>child,</b> and to our family’s patterns.|$|R
5|$|The NDH {{government}} struck {{upon the}} idea of trying to re-educate these children to become something akin to an Ustaše version of the Hitler Youth, thereby turning them against their Serb parents. The regime saw this as a more effective way of placing pressure on the Yugoslav Partisan movement than killing <b>the</b> <b>children</b> outright. However, the NDH regime had not made any arrangements to implement this idea, so {{the establishment of a}} children's camp was done in haste, especially as there was strong pressure to do something for <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> NDH regime propaganda advanced the idea that <b>the</b> <b>children</b> were being liberated from slavery {{at the hands of the}} Partisans.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>children</b> {{spent the}} morning in the resort's Kids' Club, then the family lunched at their {{apartment}} before heading to the pool.

The McCanns put <b>the</b> <b>children</b> to bed around 19:00.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>children</b> {{were put}} into {{the care of a}} nanny, as was usual in upper-class {{families}} at the time.

5000|$|The aim is for <b>the</b> <b>child</b> {{to be able}} to {{construct}} a new and coherent autobiography that enables <b>the</b> <b>child</b> {{to be in touch with}} their inner feelings.

5000|$|Firstly the {{therapist}} becomes 'non-verbally attuned' with <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> affective state. <b>The</b> therapist then attempts to explore 'themes' with <b>the</b> <b>child</b> whilst remaining attuned. Whilst this is done, {{the therapist}} then 'co-regulates' (helps <b>the</b> <b>child</b> to manage) <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> emerging affective states with 'matched vitality affect', and develops secondary affective/mental representations of them which is co-constructed with <b>the</b> <b>child</b> {{for purposes of}} integration (the therapist tries to help <b>the</b> <b>child</b> gain a coherent narrative about their experiences and {{an awareness of the}} positive aspects of themselves). According to Hughes [...] "The therapist allows the subjective experience of <b>the</b> <b>child</b> to impact <b>the</b> therapist. The therapist can then truly enter into that experience and from there express her/his own subjective experience. As the therapist holds both subjective experiences, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> experiences both. As <b>the</b> <b>child</b> senses both, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> begins to integrate them and re-experience the event {{in a way that will}} facilitate its integration and resolution."
