5|$|Following the crisis, <b>the</b> <b>Colonel</b> Director of Retainers {{retained}} his privileged {{possession of}} the Staff of Authority and was granted the same investigative and censorial powers as the Chancellor and Imperial Counselor over officialdom. He routinely inspected the conduct of officials in the capital region and seven nearby commanderies. His investigative powers matched those of a provincial Inspector, although his Staff of Authority made him {{more powerful than the}} latter. <b>The</b> <b>Colonel</b> Director of Retainers was a personal servant of the emperor, answering only to him, allowing the emperor to greatly enhance his control over the bureaucracy.

5|$|In 1886 {{a colonel}} renowned {{for lack of}} {{discipline}} published newspaper articles criticizing the Minister of War, an act of insubordination forbidden by law.

The minister, {{as well as the}} conservative cabinet headed by João Maurício Wanderley, decided not to penalize <b>the</b> <b>colonel</b> in an attempt to quiet dissention. However, the cabinet went further and removed any constraint on military officers broadcasting their views. In consequence of this policy, subordinates were thenceforth able to publicly criticize their superiors, thus undermining both military and political authority, including that of the cabinet itself.|$|E
