5|$|Blamey was {{involved}} in discussions with the government over the size of <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>to</b> be maintained. Now that the danger of invasion of Australia had passed, the government reconsidered how the nation's resources, particularly of manpower, should be distributed. Blamey pressed for a commitment to maintain three AIF divisions, as only they could legally be sent north of the equator where the final campaigns would be fought. He urged that the Empire Air Training Scheme be curtailed, and opposed MacArthur's proposal to use the Australian Army primarily for logistic support and leave combat roles principally to American troops.|$|E

5|$|By {{morning of}} January 3, Washington had reached Princeton. After a brief battle, the British there were decisively {{defeated}} and {{a substantial number}} of the garrison under command of Mawhood was captured.

This they did, leaving forward positions at New Brunswick. Washington moved his army to Morristown for winter quarters.|$|E
5|$|Constructed in Canada, a 'runway plough', {{assembled}} in Scotland, survives at Eglinton Country Park. It {{was purchased by}} the army in World War II to rip up aerodrome runways and railway lines if an invasion took place as means of causing disruption, making them useless to the occupying forces. It was used at the old Eglinton Estate, which had been commandeered by <b>the</b> <b>army,</b> <b>to</b> provide its army operators with the necessary experience. It was hauled by a powerful Foden Trucks tractor, possibly via a pulley and cable system.|$|E

5|$|During {{the march}} to Kediri, the Mataram–VOC army purposefully split {{itself and the}} columns took different, {{indirect}} routes to Kediri, as suggested by Amangkurat. This enabled <b>the</b> <b>army</b> <b>to</b> meet more factions and to win over those with wavering allegiance. The army marched through areas previously unexplored by the Dutch. The Dutch account was recorded in a journal by Hurdt's secretary Johan Jurgen Briel. Accounts of the campaign also appear in babads (Javanese chronicles).|$|E
5|$|He {{planned to}} engage his two central armies with the Muslim centre {{in an effort}} to stall them while the main thrusts would be against the wings of the Muslim army, which would then either be driven away from the {{battlefield}} or pushed towards the centre.

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} debate, Kennedy asked Phillips {{what would happen}} if Nhu responded to the cuts by {{diverting}} money away from <b>the</b> <b>army</b> <b>to</b> prop up his personal schemes. When Kennedy asked if Nhu would blame the US for any resulting military deterioration, Phillips replied that the ARVN would revolt, because the ARVN officers who were on Viet Cong hit lists would not allow the communists to run loose. Phillips said that if Nhu tried to divert military aid away from the troops to prop up his personal schemes, the Americans could deliver the money straight to the countryside in suitcases.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> had <b>to</b> handle huge {{stockpiles}} of equipment, stores and supplies.

Over next fifty years, operations would be conducted by the new Australian Regular Army that Sturdee created, rather than the Militia or specially enlisted expeditionary forces.|$|R

5|$|Problems {{continued}} to crop up.

However, the other generals on Pan Mei's side began to doubt Yang's loyalty to Song as Yang Ye used to serve Northern Han.
