5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> of Historic Places. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E
