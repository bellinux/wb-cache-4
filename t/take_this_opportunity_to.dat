25|$|Unhappy in school, Napoleon {{writes about}} his {{difficulties}} {{in a letter}} to his family. A bully reports to a monk that Napoleon is hiding letters in his bed, and the monk tears the letter to pieces. Angry, Napoleon goes to visit the attic quarters of his friend Fleuri, a place of refuge where Napoleon keeps his captive bird, a young eagle that was sent to him from Corsica by an uncle. Napoleon tenderly pets the eagle's head, then leaves to fetch water for the bird. The two bullies <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> set the bird free. Napoleon finds the bird gone and runs to the dormitory to demand the culprit show himself. None of the boys admits to the deed. Napoleon exclaims that they are all guilty, and begins to fight them all, jumping from bed to bed. In the clash, pillows are split and feathers fly through the air as the Minim Fathers work to restore order. They collar Napoleon and throw him outside in the snow. Napoleon cries to himself on the limber of a cannon, then he looks up to see the young eagle in a tree. He calls to the eagle which flies down to the cannon barrel. Napoleon caresses the eagle and smiles through his tears.|$|E
25|$|When a brilliantly timed naval {{attack on}} Soviet bomber bases with submarine-launched cruise missiles, with a strike force that {{includes}} the USS Chicago, cripples the Soviet bomber force, the Soviets lose their most effective convoy and fleet-killing weapon. The U.S. Marines <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> stage an amphibious assault on Iceland backed by the NATO navies, retaking the island and closing the Atlantic to Soviet forces. A failed bomber raid on the NATO naval forces attacking Iceland (in which the remaining Soviet naval cruise missile bomber fleets are nearly wiped out) essentially means victory in the Atlantic, opening the USSR to direct attacks from carrier strike groups against its northern strategic areas and {{the free flow of}} convoys across the Atlantic. The Soviet occupation force is soon forced to unconditionally surrender, ending the threat of air raids on convoys. Simultaneously with the reversal in the Atlantic, the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, a renowned poker player, makes an audacious gamble {{in the face of a}} final Soviet offensive that pushes NATO ground forces to the breaking point, launching an unexpected flanking manoeuvre that places heavy NATO forces in the rear of the Soviet spearhead, cutting off their last Category A regular army units behind the Leine River and interdicting their supplies. Intelligence gained from a prisoner on Iceland finally reveals the dire fuel situation in the USSR to NATO, which changes bombing priorities to wipe out the Red Army's forward fuel depots, essentially immobilizing the Soviet formations. Due to intense political pressure from Moscow to maintain an offensive into the Ruhr, the CINC-West refuses to allow Alekseyev to transfer his Category A troops east to close the salient. With the Soviet advance decisively halted, NATO catches its breath and prepares to move into a general offensive against the increasingly ineffective Soviet Category C reserves now being moved forward. At this time, Chairman Kosov confronts Minister Sergetov, and informs him that a power struggle is underway at the KGB between himself and a faction lead by the younger Jozef Larionov that has been favoured by the Politburo. At the next meeting, Sergetov pressures the Politburo into promoting Alekseyev to CINC-West, while his former superior is executed at Lefortovo Prison. Now forced to take direct orders from the Politburo, Alekseyev finds himself unable to secure a victory, and the NATO counteroffensive begins.|$|E

500|$|Later that month, {{during his}} fifth combat with American pilots, he shot down two more P-51s before {{being forced to}} bail out, when eight other P-51s ran his Messerschmitt out of fuel. During the intense manoeuvring, Hartmann managed to line {{up one of the}} P-51s at close range, but heard only a [...] "clank" [...] when he fired, as he had run out of ammunition. While he was hanging in his parachute, the P-51s circled above him, and Hartmann {{wondered}} if they would <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> kill him. One of the P-51Bs flown by Lt. Robert J. Goebel of the 308th Squadron, 31st Fighter Group, broke away and headed straight for him. Goebel was making a camera pass to record the bailout and banked away from him only at the last moment, waving at Hartmann as he went by.|$|E
500|$|... "Mongrels friends, {{it is my}} unbearably sad duty to {{announce}} {{that we will not}} be returning for a third series on BBC Three, a decision that has been made {{based on the fact that}} apparently you need more than two people watching a programme to make it successful. Crazy talk. I'd like to <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> thank everyone at BBC Comedy, BBC Three and BBC Worldwide who have supported us so strongly over the years, and helped us put our silly puppet show on the digital screens of the nation. I'd also like to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all the writers, cast, crew and support team who have made a horribly challenging show such an utter joy to make. This news could not be less of a reflection on your brilliant work. Most of all I'd like to thank those of you that loved watching Mongrels as much as we loved making it. It's wonderfully reassuring to think that we weren't mad after all, and that what we find funny, other people do too. I'd like to believe that there's room on television for a little show like ours; one that's not just another sitcom, one that tries to do things a bit differently and that tries to push a few boundaries here and there. Who knows, maybe we'll find a that room in the future. I hope it has a minibar. Thank you for watching. Both of you." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{was planned}} to {{construct}} an intersection between the East London Line and the Jubilee Line extension at Canada Water tube station. As construction would require the temporary closure of the East London Line, {{it was decided to}} <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> perform long-term maintenance on the tunnel and so in 1995 the East London Line was closed to allow construction and maintenance to take place. The proposed repair method for the tunnel was to seal it against leaks by [...] "shotcreting" [...] it with concrete, obliterating its original appearance, causing a controversy that led to a bitter conflict between London Underground who wished to complete the work as quickly and cheaply as possible and architectural interests wishing to preserve the tunnel's appearance. The architectural interests won with the Grade II* listing of the tunnel on 24 March 1995 (the day London Underground had scheduled the start of the long-term maintenance work).|$|E
2500|$|Executive Producer Santer said, [...] "With all {{the turmoil}} facing the Mitchells this year, {{it feels like}} a great time to bring back Sam, the {{original}} Mitchell sister.

[...] In an interview with media website Digital Spy, Santer discussed the reasoning behind his decision to reintroduce Sam: [...] "What makes Sam interesting for me is that she's Ricky's first love and first wife. As Bianca and Ricky spend more time together [...] the inevitability of them at some point coming together increases. What's stopping them? Well, it's Sam. Sam and Ricky had a good thing going all those years ago. All Ricky ever gets off Bianca is indifference, whereas Sam - and who knows quite why - is less than indifferent towards him and it makes a nice change".|$|E

2500|$|Finberg says [...] "I think I may <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> protest {{once again}} against the {{prevalent}} habit of calling this artist Janssens. In spite of Walpole's unfortunate remark {{that this is}} the correct form of the name, there is no excuse for using it. While in England the artist invariably spelt his name Cornelius Johnson, and when he left England he changed the form to Jonson. The usual form of his signature when the name is given in full is invariably, in all the pictures painted after 1643 which I have seen : ' Cornelius Jonson van Ceulen.' He appears never to have adopted the form of Janson, Jansen, or Janssens. But so long as auctioneers are born with an ingrained conviction that a foreign-looking name gives greater value to a picture than an English name, so long may we expect to find Cornelius Johnson or Jonson masquerading in catalogues as Cornelius Janssens." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{its initial}} years {{the company had}} {{occasionally}} had to purchase wheat from other sources to meet the RAC demands. In 1840 John McLoughlin had to purchase 4,000 bushels of wheat from Alta California to supplement produce made by the PSAC. During the 1840s pastoral and agricultural produce shipped to New Archangel annually consistently was 30,000lbs of beef and from 40,000 to 80,000lbs of wheat. Governor Arvid Etholén praised wheat produced by the PSAC as [...] "incomparably cheaper" [...] than produced bought from American merchants and being of [...] "the best quality." [...] Despite the PSAC's initial growth, its principal manager, John McLoughlin didn't hold a favorable view of the venture. In a letter written to Douglas prior to the 1838 London meetings, McLoughlin criticized what eventually became the PSAC:"I will <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> state it is my opinion that, though I think individuals who would devote their attention to raising cattle in the Columbia might make a living at it still it is my opinion the Hudson's Bay Company will make nothing by it." ...|$|E
