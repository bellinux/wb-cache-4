I was to learn, or course, that such romantic conceptions are not only born in the minds of fiction writers, but can die there as well.|$|E

500|$|The {{anthropologist}} Paul van der Grijp believes Oviri {{was intended}} [...] as an epithet to reinforce Gauguin's persona as a [...] "civilised savage". [...] The artist {{wrote in his}} final letter to Morice that [...] "You were wrong that day when you said I was wrong <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> was a savage. It's true enough: I am a savage. And civilised people sense the fact. In my work {{there is nothing that}} can surprise or disconcert, except the fact that I am a savage in spite of myself. That's also why my work is inimitable." ...|$|E
500|$|Cudi {{commented that}} the way the song was {{recorded}} {{was similar to the}} way prior collaborations between the two were recorded; West will bounce ideas off of other writers and gauge their reaction before going forward with any of his own ideas. In an interview with MTV Cudi commented, [...] "that's always our collab formula, and that's just how 'Gorgeous' came about. He just kind of told me what he was trying <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> threw out some words, we rearranged words, and we came out with a bunch of different options before we come up with the hook." ...|$|E

500|$|Finally, while I {{was visiting}} Andrew at his country estate in Berkshire to play him the tracks we had recorded, he {{suddenly}} {{sat down at}} the piano and played the most beautiful melody, which he suggested could be our new song. Needless <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> grabbed it. However, we still needed lyrics and Tim dutifully began to put words to the music. The vast majority of the original Evita score had been done this way: music first, lyrics afterwards. After many weeks of nail biting, Tim was finally cajoled into writing the lyrics that now accompany the music to [...] "You Must Love Me".|$|E

[...] Padres general manager Kevin Towers said, [...] "I get e-mails daily from fans saying, 'Sign Rickey.' ...I get more calls and e-mails about him than anybody...

500|$|Poitier and Wilder became friends, {{with the}} pair working {{together}} on a script called Traces—which became 1982's Hanky Panky, the film where Wilder met comedian Gilda Radner. Through {{the remainder of the}} decade, Wilder and Radner worked on several projects together. After Hanky Panky, Wilder directed his third film, 1984's The Woman in Red, which starred Wilder, Radner, and Kelly Le Brock. The Woman in Red was not well received by the critics, nor was their next project, 1986's Haunted Honeymoon, which failed to attract audiences. The Woman in Red did win an Academy Award for Best Original Song for Stevie Wonder's song [...] "I Just Called <b>to</b> <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> Love You".|$|E
500|$|... "Papa Don't Preach" [...] is {{a message}} song that {{everyone}} is going to take the wrong way. Immediately they're going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> am advising every young girl {{to go out and get}} pregnant. When I first heard the song, I thought it was silly. But then I thought, wait a minute, this song is really about a girl who is making a decision in her life. She has a very close relationship with her father and wants to maintain that closeness. To me it's a celebration of life. It says, 'I love you, father, and I love this man and this child that is growing inside me'. Of course, who knows how it will end?

500|$|Madonna also {{understood}} that {{as she was}} growing up, so was her core audience. Feeling the need to attempt something different, she wanted {{the sound of her}} new album to dictate what could be popular in the music world. The singer had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album. For the title track, Madonna chose topics that until then had been personal meditations never to be shared with the general public. She perused of her personal journals and diaries, and began considering options. She recalled, [...] "What was it I wanted <b>to</b> <b>say?</b> <b>I</b> wanted the album to speak to things on my mind. It was a complex time in my life." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{controversial}} single [...] "Welcome to the Terrordome" [...] references {{the murder}} of Yusef Hawkins and the 1989 riots in Virginia Beach, and it has Chuck D criticizing Jewish leaders who protested Public Enemy in response to Professor Griff's anti-Semitic remarks. He addresses the controversy as being {{in the center of}} political turmoil, with criticisms of the media and references to the Crucifixion of Jesus: [...] "Crucifixion ain't no fiction / So called chosen frozen / Apology made to who ever pleases / Still they got me like Jesus". He is also critical of Blacks and those who [...] "blame somebody else when you destroy yourself": [...] "Every brother ain't a brother / 'cause a Black hand squeezed on Malcolm X the man / the shootin of Huey Newton / from the hand of Nig who pulled the trigger". His lyricism features dizzying raps and internal rhyme: [...] "Lazer, anastasia, maze ya / Ways to blaze your brain and train ya [...] Sad <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> got sold down the river / Still some quiver when I deliver / Never <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> never knew or had a clue / Word was heard, plus hard on the boulevard / Lies, scandalizin', basin' / Traits of hate who's celebratin' wit Satan?". Its dense production incorporates numerous samples, including several James Brown tracks and the guitar line from The Temptations' [...] "Psychedelic Shack". Several other samples are heard amid Chuck D's rapping, such as the line [...] "come on, you can get it-get it-get it" [...] from Instant Funk's [...] "I Got My Mind Made Up (You Can Get It Girl)". AllMusic's John Bush cites the track as [...] "the production peak of the Bomb Squad and one of Chuck D.'s best rapping performances ever ... one of their tracks were more musically incendiary".|$|E

The Reverend Al Sharpton received a standing ovation with cheers when he told Jackson's children: [...] "Wasn't nothing strange about your daddy. It was strange what your daddy had to deal with.
