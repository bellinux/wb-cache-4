40|$|Summer {{precipitation}} in continental midlatitude regions {{is significantly}} contributed by local recycling, i. e., by moisture {{returning to the}} atmosphere through evapotranspiration from the same region. On the other hand, reduced soil moisture availability may limit evapotranspiration rates with effects on the planetary boundary layer dynamics through the partitioning between sensible and latent heat fluxes. Thus, a dependence may exist between precipitation and antecedent soil moisture conditions. Here we provide theoretical and experimental {{evidence in support of}} the hypothesis that in continental regions summer soil moisture anomalies affect the probability of occurrence of subsequent precipitation. Owing to these feedbacks, two preferential states may arise in summer soil moisture dynamics, which thus tend <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>locked</b> either <b>in</b> a “dry” or a “wet” state, whereas intermediate conditions have low probability of occurrence. In this manner, such land–atmosphere interactions would explain the possible persistence of summer droughts sustained by positive feedbacks in response to initial (spring) surface moisture anomalies...|$|R

Despite these significant efforts, including prosecuting its first trafficking cases under the recent anti-trafficking law and establishing a new anti-trafficking office, the government did not show overall evidence of increasing efforts to address human trafficking through providing adequate victim services or addressing official complicity in trafficking; therefore, Guatemala is placed on Tier 2, for the fourth consecutive year. Despite the significant number of foreign trafficking victims identified by the government, foreign victims were not generally offered asylum or temporary residency, although the anti-trafficking law provides that authority. As such, most foreign trafficking victims were deported or required <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>locked</b> migrant detention facilities with no access to specialized victim services.|$|R

The results show superb echo capture even over extreme terrain, a very good outcome over most land surfaces but a sub-optimal performance over inland water. The interplay between surface targets, tracker response and autonomous mode switching is illustrated to explain the RA- 2 behaviour.

40|$|This thesis {{will make}} an {{original}} contribution to the literature on cross-cultural domestic space. It also has ethnographic potential {{for the analysis of}} other individuals and groups both within, and across cultures. My specific approach, combining domestic space, namely the,kitchen, and feminism, sexuality, gender, memory and politics has not previously been undertaken. Feminist literature has largely criticised the domestic unit and domestic labour as being private, gendered, oppressive and endowing women with the responsibility of social reproduction. Kitchen practices, cuisine, and food rituals have been studied and largely articulated as an expression of cultural identity and consumption, gender power relations, technology, class, desire, taste and style. However, such criticism seems <b>to</b> have <b>remained</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> a heteronormative discourse. My approach draws on key aspects of cross-cultural perspectives on social space (e. g. Humphrey 1974, de Certeau 1986, Bourdieu 1990, Carsten and Hugh-Jones 1995, Das et al 2008) often studied beyond Europe. Here, seemingly private 'home' space is problematised within a western metropolis with gendered, historical specificity. The core focus is to illustrate the potential in using the kitchen as a 'spatial category' for conceptualising relationships between groups, kin or otherwise, but also relationships between individuals; different realms of life; and the rationale or logic that informants creatively engage in {{to make sense of the}} world. The subjects in this study group were of several nationalities and class origins (British, Irish, Swiss, Scottish, Canadian, American, German-British) and between 45 and 76 years at the time of research. They all identified as lesbians. The research was conducted from an anthropological perspective but required an interdisciplinary approach that included insights from cultural geography, feminism, social gerontology, sociology and architectural history. As my findings suggest, through the kitchen 'spatial' stories narrated by older lesbians, the kitchen emerged as a tangle of cultural norms, customs, duties, ideas, aspirations, expectations, and values that tells about the thinking process and behaviour of a specific society or group of people. In this context, the kitchen brings out the experiences of social inequalities experienced by older lesbians, mainly brought out by the hegemonic institution of heteronormativity and patriarchy. This understanding mirrors the different ideological and political dimensions flowing through the kitchen such as, gender/sexual issues, family dynamics, modernity, urbanism, social contradiction, religion, ethnicity, class, feminism and financial background. Many had to confront the stigma of sexual identity with punitive legal and political consequences, risking even the loss of their children. The domestic kitchen, ostensibly comfortingly neutral and a-political, emerges as a complex and multi-faceted place, where its meaning is temporal, relational and contextual.

These mutations cause GTPase RAS <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> constitutively active signals through the downstream cascades leading to proliferation. A series of earlier studies {{reported on the}} morphological appearance of cells upon RAS activation.

Recent works found that the active RAS induces benign and malig-nant morphological changes in organoids, which are an in vitro model system for epithelial tissue. The studies of animal models support the basic oncogenic features of RAS revealed in vitro, while also providing evidence that the effects of RAS activation in vivo are different from those in vitro. The pathological observation of the various human materials indicates that the oncogenic RAS participates in metaplasia, which occurs before proliferation, and that RAS promotes mucin production in various organs. These morphological analyses may shed light on important signalling pathways that merit investigation in vitro...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a glaring lack of {{research}} on institutional configurations, which impede rather than promote economic success. Building on Richard Whitley's business systems theory {{and based on the}} experience of East Africa, this paper attempts to fill a gap in the literature by identifying a distinct variety of capitalism, the segmented business system. Segmented business systems are characterized by rigid internal divisions between different areas of economic activity. The relative impermeability of barriers between the latter partially accounts for their weak track record; this is mitigated—but, in some cases, exacerbated—through the operation of informal networks of support. Whilst segmented business systems would seem to be characterized by consistent institutional failure, specific aspects thereof have proved highly functional to elite interests. However, given their vulnerability to external and internal pressures, segmented business systems are likely <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> a cycle of generally poor and uneven economic performance in the absence of radical reforms...|$|E

40|$|Value {{shares are}} notorious for {{remaining}} stagnant for extended periods of time, forcing value investors <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> their investments often for excessive periods. This research study applied the price acceleration momentum indicator of Bird and Casavecchia (2007) on a value portfolio {{with the objective of}} improving the timing of value share acquisitions. A time series study was conducted, taking into account the top 160 JSE shares over the period 1 January 1985 to 31 August 2012. A price acceleration momentum indicator was applied to enhance a value portfolio formed on the basis of book-tomarket ratio, dividend yield and EBITDA/EV. Cumulative average abnormal returns (CAAR) were used to compare portfolio results statistically. A substantial contribution is made to the literature by proving that a value-only portfolio can be significantly enhanced by the combination of price acceleration momentum. Results indicated an increase in CAAR from 199. 83 % to 321. 29 %. Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio) were also improved without the detriment of increased share price volatility (standard deviation). This research study further contributes to the literature by proving that a price acceleration momentum indicator adds no additional value over a value portfolio combined with ordinary price momentum.

40|$|Stakeholder' {{has become}} the primary {{category}} of political actor in decision-making, not least within nature conservation. Drawing from Habermas' theory on communicative action, this article argues that there are democratic deficits to the stakeholder model that promote citizens <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> predetermined, polarized positions. It contends that the stakeholder model must, hence, be scrutinized with respect to its potential role in perpetuating conservation conflicts in modernity. Using the case study of stakeholder-based game management delegations (GMDs) in Sweden, our research identifies four barriers, which tie to the instrumental basis and liberal democratic legacy of the stakeholder approach: 1) strong sense of accountability; 2) overly purposive atmosphere; 3) overemphasis on decision as final outcome; and 4) perceived inability {{on the part of}} the delegates to influence science-led decision-making. The article suggests that these democratic deficits preclude the deliberation and contestation necessary to legitimate conservation policy. Indeed, stakeholder rationality causes citizens to become inert, instrumental agents who approach discussion with strategic rather than communicative rationality. We conclude that the deficits of the stakeholder model currently: 1) restrict democratic freedom for citizens; 2) engender a crisis of legitimacy of management; and 3) reproduce the conflict, which in Sweden relates to the conservation of wolves...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{top-down}} {{approach to the}} symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) based on a statistical dynamical framework. An increased depth in the basins of attraction of attractor network states in the brain makes each state too stable, so that it tends <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> that state and can not easily be moved on to another state. We suggest that the different symptoms that may be present in OCD {{could be related to}} changes of this type in different brain regions. For example, the difficulty in attentional and cognitive set switching could be related to networks operating in this way in the prefrontal cortex. Repetitive actions and a difficulty in moving to new actions could be related to overstability in networks in the higher order motor, including cingulate areas. In integrateand-fire network simulations, an increase in the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and ⁄ or a-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor conductances, which increases the depth of the attractor basins, increases the stability of attractor networks, and makes them less easily moved on to another state by a new stimulus. Increasing c-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -receptor activated currents can partly reverse this overstability. There is now some evidence for overactivity in glutamate transmitter systems in OCD, and the hypothesis presented here shows how some of the symptoms of OCD could be produced by the increase in the stability of attractor networks that is produced by increased glutamatergic activity...|$|E
40|$|National {{production}} {{systems have been}} fragmented from above and below Ã� by emerging global production networks and regional systems of production. Increasingly, national systems of production do not sit between global and local but are formed out of them (Castells, 1997). Yet the relationship between global and local production networks is a tense one: while regional industrial systems enable more rewarding participation in global networks, participation in those networks simultaneously presents potential problems of the `hollowing out' {{of the region and}} of the `locking in' of the region at lower levels of the hierarchy of the international division of labour (O'Hearn, 2001). Strategic participation in global networks of production and innovation is crucial to developing strong regional systems. But in order to negotiate access to {{the upper reaches of the}} production and innovation hierarchy, a strong regional system is crucial. A dilemma presents itself for regions seeking to grow and develop industrially: how to use global networks to develop the very local systems that will enable regions to bargain their way into a more favourable position within those networks. The information technology industry in the Republic of Ireland is a useful case for exploring these industrial development dilemmas. Since the 1950 s, industrial policy in Ireland has focused on the attraction of foreign investment. After initial growth in the 1960 s and 1970 s, an economy increasingly based on branch plants and transfer pricing ran into economic problems in the 1980 s. Mass unemployment and emigration in the 1980 s gave little sign of the economic boom to follow in the 1990 s. Driven by foreign investment and governed by new `social partnership' institutions, the Celtic Tiger years of the 1990 s represented a startling turnaround in economic fortunes so that Irish GDP outstripped the EU average by the late 1990 s (OÃ� Riain and O'Connell, 2000). But if the economic growth of the 1990 s is unquestioned, the extent and character of the industrial transformations underpinning it are more controversial. Some see the Celtic Tiger years as bringing industrial upgrading led by foreign firms, while others see the influence of foreign firms as more pernicious, with Ireland in the 1990 s largely the beneficiary of enormous entrepot flows of international capital (Barry, 1999; O'Hearn, 2001). However, while there are striking entrepot characteristics to foreign firms in Ireland, significant industrial upgrading has occurred across a wide range of sectors. We see growth almost completely across the board in investment, R&D, employment, professionalization and productivity (OÃ� Riain, 2004 a). Perhaps the central contradiction of Irish industrial development that has fostered the controversies of recent years is that entrepot activity and industrial upgrading occurred within the same sectors and even within the same firms. An intriguing aspect of Irish development is the emergence of local deepening and upgrading from within these non-productive flows of capital. This article uses these contradictions within the Irish industrial structure to explore the dilemmas of development in a world of global and local networks. Through a case study of the development of the software industry, the most dynamic sector of the Irish economy in the 1990 s, the article explores how an industry and region that was `locked Volume 28. 3 September 2004 642 - 63 International Journal of Urban and Regional Research Ã� Joint Editors and Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

The analysis suggests that state strategies are central to the ability of firms and territories to integrate into particular niches in global production networks. Relations within production networks tend to become institutionalized and self-reproducing. Firms and territories tend <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> to a particular niche, in the absence of a `development project' or coalition that mobilizes resources and cooperation to generate a push into a niche further up the network hierarchy. The push for moving up the network comes when a marginalized or vulnerable group within or on the edges of the network makes an alliance with supportive public agencies (OÃ� Riain, 2004 b). Global production networks tend to institutionalize hierarchical relations, but this does not mean that it is impossible for developmental coalitions to mobilize around the connections and resources within those networks to enter new niches further up these hierarchies. In practice, this requires a concerted and ongoing state policy of industrial development and innovation promotion...|$|E
