5|$|The woollen {{industry}} in Wales was {{at times the}} country's most important industry, though it often struggled <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> better-funded woollen mills {{in the north of}} England, and almost disappeared during the 20th century. There is continued demand for quality Welsh woollen products.|$|E
5|$|As {{preparations}} {{were made}} for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live. Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, they {{decided to make the}} August tour their last.|$|E
5|$|From 1971 Texas Instruments {{had been}} making {{available}} the building block for a simple calculator on a single chip and the TMS0803 chipset appeared {{in a number of}} Sinclair calculators. Clive Sinclair wanted to design a calculator <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> HP-35 using this series of chips. Despite scepticism about the feasibility of the project from Texas Instruments engineers, Nigel Searle was able to design algorithms that sacrificed some speed and accuracy in order to implement scientific functions on the TMS0805 variation.|$|E

5|$|McGivney {{traveled}} to Boston {{to examine the}} Massachusetts Catholic Order of Foresters and to Brooklyn, New York {{to learn about the}} recently established Catholic Benevolent League, both of which offered insurance benefits. He found the latter to be lacking the excitement he thought was needed if his organization were <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> secret societies of the day. He explored establishing a New Haven Court of the Foresters, but the group's charter in Massachusetts limited them to operating within the Commonwealth. McGivney's committee of St. Mary's parishioners decided to form a new club.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Alexander Twining and James Harrison set up ice {{plants in}} Ohio and Melbourne {{respectively}} during the 1850s, both using Perkins engines. Twining {{found he could}} not compete with natural ice, but in Melbourne Harrison's plant came to dominate the market. Australia's distance from New England, where journeys could take 115 days, and the consequent high level of wastage– 150 tons of the first 400-ton shipment to Sydney melted on route– made it relatively easy for plant ice <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> natural product. Elsewhere, however, natural ice dominated the entire market.|$|E

As of 2010, {{as well as the}} 737, the A320 family faces competition from Embraer's E-195 (to the A318), and the CSeries being developed by Bombardier to the A318/A319.|$|E
5|$|The Original Six era {{ended in}} 1967 when the NHL {{doubled in size}} by adding six new {{expansion}} teams. The six existing teams were formed into the newly created East Division, while the expansion teams were formed into the West Division. The NHL continued to expand, adding another six teams, to total 18 by 1974. This continued expansion was partially {{brought about by the}} NHL's attempts <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> World Hockey Association, which operated from 1972 until 1979 and sought <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> NHL for markets and players. Bobby Hull was the most famous player to defect to the rival league, signing a $2.75 million contract with the Winnipeg Jets. The NHL became involved in international play in the mid-1970s, starting with the Summit Series in 1972 which pitted the top Canadian players of the NHL against the top players in the Soviet Union, which was won by Canada with four wins, three losses, and a tie. Eventually, Soviet-Bloc players streamed into the NHL with the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{inspired}} by works such as the Discworld series, and the character of Simon was created <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> characters of such works. The character was modelled on characters including Blackadder. Simon the Sorcerer was well received, with reviewers praising the humour and graphics. The game was re-released on CD, featuring voice-overs, with Simon being voiced by Chris Barrie. Ports for iOS and Android were released in 2009 and 2013 respectively, and the game was released on GOG.com in 2008. The second instalment in the series, , was released in 1995.|$|E

The TRD variants were pitched <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Subaru Liberty GT and Mazda 6 MPS. Since its introduction, the Aurion has received numerous awards and positive reviews. In particular, {{the car has}} been praised for its good performance mated with comparatively low fuel consumption, and the inclusion of safety and comfort features that are optional on competitor vehicles.|$|E
5|$|While MLS {{has looked}} into {{changing}} to a fall-to-spring format, {{there are no}} current plans to do so. If the league were to change its schedule, a substantial winter break would still be necessary due to teams being located in harsh winter climates. It would also have <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> popularity and media presence of the National Football League (NFL) {{in the fall and}} winter as well as the National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Hockey League (NHL), which both run on fall-to-spring schedules.|$|E
5|$|After the lynchings {{of their}} {{prominent}} competitors, the WSGA's {{control over the}} range was undisputed, until a group of smaller ranchers led by a local cowboy named Nate Champion formed the Northern Wyoming Farmers and Stock Growers' Association (NWFSGA) <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> WSGA. Upon hearing this, the WSGA immediately viewed Champion's association {{as a threat to}} their hold on the stock interests. The WSGA then blacklisted members of the NWFSGA from the round-ups in order to stop their operations. However, the latter refused the orders to disband and instead publicly announced their plans to hold their own round-up in the spring of 1892.|$|E

5|$|At {{its peak}} in 1912, the B {{operated}} 12 Boston-Albany round trips, one Boston-Pittsfield round trip, {{and as many as}} 10 Pittsfield-North Adams round trips. Around 1913 the New Haven planned to use the Housatonic as part of a New York-Montreal through route <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> NYC, but this never materialized and service levels were never high. After 1926 New Haven operated two daily New York-Pittsfield round trips with additional weekend service plus a Great Barrington-Pittsfield commuter trip operated by a rail bus. After 1935, nonstop New York-Pittsfield weekend trips were added for skiers during the winter.|$|E
5|$|Between World War I and World War II, {{many new}} aspirin brands and aspirin-based {{products}} entered the market. The Australian company Nicholas Proprietary Limited, through the aggressive marketing strategies of George Davies, built Aspro {{into a global}} brand, with particular strength in Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K. American brands such as Burton's Aspirin, Molloy's Aspirin, Cal-Aspirin and St. Joseph Aspirin tried <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> American Bayer, while new products such Cafaspirin (aspirin with caffeine) and Alka-Seltzer (a soluble mix of aspirin and bicarbonate of soda) put aspirin to new uses. In 1925, the German Bayer became part of IG Farben, a conglomerate of former dye companies; IG Farben's brands of Aspirin and, in Latin America, the caffeinated Cafiaspirina (co-managed with Sterling Products) competed with less expensive aspirins such as Geniol.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the first subway opened in 1904, the lines had been {{consolidated}} into two privately owned systems, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT, later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, BMT) and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT). The city built most of the lines and leased them to the companies. The first line of the city-owned and operated Independent Subway System (IND) opened in 1932; this system was intended <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> private systems and allow some of the elevated railways to be torn down, but stayed within {{the core of the}} City due to its small startup capital. This required it to be run 'at cost', necessitating fares up to double the five-cent fare popular at the time.|$|E

Rodriguez was named a Preseason All-American {{and was on the}} watch list for the Hermann Trophy. She was selected to the All-Pac-10 First Team and was an NSCAA All-American Third Team pick.|$|R
