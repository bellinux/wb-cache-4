5|$|Daisy {{is another}} of Flower's daughters and the first <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impregnated</b> by roving Lazuli male Carlos. When the Whiskers were {{temporarily}} split into two groups after a goshawk attack {{in the middle of}} the series, Daisy assumed the role of dominant female of the splinter group, but lost the role when her evicted sister Tosca found the group and took control. When the splinter group rejoined the main Whiskers, Flower discovered Daisy's pregnancy but allowed her to remain in the group. Daisy gave birth in an empty burrow, and after Yossarian found her, he helped to carry her newborn pups to the real burrow. The next day, Flower initiated a burrow move. In order to remain with her family, Daisy left the pups behind to die in the abandoned burrow.|$|E
5|$|Female {{cockroaches}} {{are sometimes}} seen carrying egg cases {{on the end}} of their abdomens; the German cockroach holds about 30 to 40 long, thin eggs in a case called an ootheca. She drops the capsule prior to hatching, though live births do occur in rare instances. The egg capsule may take more than five hours to lay and is initially bright white in color. The eggs are hatched from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air. The hatchlings are initially bright white nymphs and continue inflating themselves with air, becoming harder and darker within about four hours. Their transient white stage while hatching and later while molting has led to claims of albino cockroaches. Development from eggs to adults takes three to four months. Cockroaches live up to a year, and the female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime; in favorable conditions, she can produce 300 to 400 offspring. Other species of cockroaches, however, can produce far more eggs; in some cases a female needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impregnated</b> only once to be able to lay eggs {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
500|$|Rocket Dog's sister, Maybelline, is one {{of three}} Whiskers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impregnated</b> by roving Zappa males while {{they are part of a}} {{temporarily}} splinter group led by Rocket Dog. Maybelline gave birth just before Flower's death, and as Flower had no litter of her own at the time, the Kalahari Meerkat Project believes it was Maybelline's newborn pups that Flower was protecting when she was killed by a snake. When Rocket Dog initiated a burrow move, Maybelline at first refused to move her young pups but later gave in. [...] When her pups were older, Maybelline rebelled against Rocket Dog's leadership. Unable to depose her sister, Maybelline left the Whiskers with her pups and a couple of adults at the end of the third series to form a new group, the Aztecs.|$|E

60|$|Considering {{the whole}} case, there seems {{no room to}} doubt the justness of the {{conclusion}} arrived at, under the former as well as under the present species, namely, that these little parasites are the males of the two species of Ibla {{to which they are}} attached;--wonderful though the fact be, that in one case, the male should pair with an hermaphrodite already provided with efficient male organs. It is to bring this fact prominently forward, that I have called such males, Complemental Males; as they seem to form the complement to the male organs in the hermaphrodite. We look in vain for any, as yet known, analogous facts in the animal kingdom. In the genus Scalpellum, however, next in alliance to Ibla, in which, consequently, if anywhere, we might expect to find such facts, they occur; and until these are fully considered, I hope the conclusions here arrived at, will not be summarily rejected. Although the existence of Hermaphrodites and Males within the limits of the same species, is a new fact amongst animals, it is far from rare in the Vegetable Kingdom: the male flowers, moreover, are sometimes in a rudimentary condition compared to the hermaphrodite flowers, exactly {{in the same manner as}} are the male Iblas. If the final cause of the existence of these Complemental Males be asked, no certain answer can be given; the vesiculæ seminales in the hermaphrodite of Ibla quadrivalvis, appeared to be of small diameter; but on the other hand, the ova <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impregnated</b> are fewer than in most Cirripedes. No explanation, as we have seen, can be given of the much simpler case of the mere separation of the sexes in Ibla Cumingii: nor can any explanation, I believe, be given of the much more varied arrangement of the parts of fructification in plants of the Linnean class, Polygamia.|$|E
60|$|Difference in Size {{between the}} Sexes.—With insects {{of all kinds}} the males are {{commonly}} smaller than the females;[438] and this difference can often be detected even in the larval state. So considerable {{is the difference between}} the male and female cocoons of the silk-moth (Bombyx mori), that in France they are separated by a particular mode of weighing.[439] In the lower classes of the animal kingdom, the greater size of the females seems generally to depend on their developing an enormous number of ova; and this may to a certain extent hold good with insects. But Dr. Wallace has suggested a much more probable explanation. He finds, after carefully attending {{to the development of the}} caterpillars of Bombyx cynthia and yamamai, and especially of some dwarfed caterpillars reared from a second brood on unnatural food, “that in proportion as the individual moth is finer, so is the time required for its metamorphosis longer; and for this reason the female, which is the larger and heavier insect, from having to carry her numerous eggs, will be preceded by the male, which is smaller and has less to mature.”[440] Now as most insects are short-lived, and as they are exposed to many dangers, it would manifestly be advantageous to the female <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impregnated</b> as soon as possible. This end would be gained by the males being first matured in large numbers ready for the advent of the females; and this again would naturally follow, as Mr. A. E. Wallace has remarked,[441] through natural selection; for the smaller males would be first matured, and thus would procreate a large number of offspring which would inherit the reduced size of their male parents, whilst the larger males from being matured later would leave fewer offspring.|$|E

60|$|One {{of these}} landing-places is near an old fort (I {{can see the}} Nore Light from it with my pocket-glass), from which fort mysteriously emerges a boy, to whom I am much indebted for {{additions}} to my scanty stock of knowledge. He is a young boy, with an intelligent face burnt to a dust colour by the summer sun, and with crisp hair of the same hue. He is a boy in whom I have perceived nothing incompatible with habits of studious inquiry and meditation, unless an evanescent black eye (I was delicate of inquiring how occasioned) should be so considered. To him am I indebted for ability to identify a Custom-house boat at any distance, and for acquaintance with all the forms and ceremonies observed by a homeward-bound Indiaman coming up the river, when the Custom-house officers go aboard her. But for him, I might never have heard of 'the dumb-ague,' respecting which malady I am now learned. Had I never sat at his feet, I might have finished my mortal career and never known that when I see a white horse on a barge's sail, that barge is a lime barge. For precious secrets in reference to beer, am I likewise beholden to him, involving warning against the beer of a certain establishment, by reason of its having turned sour through failure in point of demand: though my young sage is not of opinion that similar deterioration has befallen the ale. He has also enlightened me touching the mushrooms of the marshes, and has gently reproved my ignorance in having supposed them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impregnated</b> with salt. His manner of imparting information, is thoughtful, and appropriate to the scene. As he reclines beside me, he pitches into the river, a little stone or piece of grit, and then delivers himself oracularly, as though he spoke out of {{the centre of the}} spreading circle that it makes in the water.

60|$|Leaving {{a number}} of his men to guard the boats, the Adelantado {{departed}} on foot with the remainder. After penetrating into the interior about four leagues and a half, they slept for the first night on the banks of a river, which seemed to water the whole country with its windings, as they had crossed it upwards of forty times. On the second day, they proceeded a league and a half farther, and arrived among thick forests, where their guides informed them the mines were situated. In fact, the whole soil appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impregnated</b> with gold. They gathered it from among the roots of the trees, which were of an immense height, and magnificent foliage. In the space of two hours each man had collected a little quantity of gold, gathered {{from the surface of the}} earth. Hence the guides took the Adelantado to the summit of a high hill, and showing him an extent of country as far as the eye could reach, assured him that the whole of it, to the distance of twenty days' journey westward, abounded in gold, naming to him several of the principal places. [160] The Adelantado gazed with enraptured eye over a vast wilderness of continued forest, where only here and there a bright column of smoke from amidst the trees gave sign of some savage hamlet, or solitary wigwam, and the wild unappropriated aspect of this golden country delighted him more than if he had beheld it covered with towns and cities, and adorned with all the graces of cultivation. He returned with his party, in high spirits, to the ships, and rejoiced the admiral with the favorable report of his expedition. It was soon discovered, however, that the politic Quibian had deceived them. His guides, by his instructions, had taken the Spaniards to the mines of a neighboring cacique with whom he was at war, hoping to divert them into the territories of his enemy. The real mines of Veragua, it was said, were nearer and much more wealthy.|$|E
6000|$|The French comedy, {{although}} Molière was in {{the zenith}} of his reputation, appears not to have possessed equal charms for the English monarch. The same restraint of decorum, which prevented the expression of natural passion in tragedy, prohibited all indelicate licence in comedy. Charles, probably, was secretly pleased with a system, which cramped the effusions of the tragic muse, and forbade, as indecorous, those bursts of rapturous enthusiasm, which might sometimes contain matter unpleasing to a royal ear.[5] But the merry monarch saw no good reason why the muse of comedy should be compelled to [...] "dwell in decencies for ever," [...] and did not feel at all degraded when enjoying a gross pleasantry, or profane witticism, in company with the mixed mass of a popular audience. The stage, therefore, resumed more than its original licence under his auspices. Most of our early plays, being written in a coarse age, and designed for the amusement of a promiscuous and vulgar audience, were dishonoured by scenes of coarse and naked indelicacy. The positive enactments of James, and the grave manners of his son, in some degree repressed this disgraceful scurrility; and, in the common course of events, the English stage would have been gradually delivered from this reproach by the increasing influence of decency and taste.[6] But Charles II., during his exile, had lived upon a footing of equality with his banished nobles, and partaken freely and promiscuously in the pleasure and frolics by which they had endeavoured to sweeten adversity. To such a court the amusements of the drama would have appeared insipid, unless seasoned with the libertine spirit which governed their lives, and which was encouraged by {{the example of the}} monarch. Thus it is acutely argued by Dennis, in reply to Collier, that the depravity of the theatre, when revived, was owing to that very suppression, which had prevented its gradual reformation. And just so a muddy stream, if allowed its free course, will gradually purify itself; but, if dammed up for a season, and let loose at once, its first torrent cannot fail <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impregnated</b> with every impurity. The licence of a rude age was thus revived by a corrupted one; and even those plays which were translated from the French and Spanish, were carefully seasoned with as much indelicacy, and double entendre, as was necessary to fit them for the ear of the wittiest and most profligate of monarchs.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{leaching}} efficiency of vanadium pentoxide (V 2 O 5) from stone coal and to reduce its connected environmental pollution, this article investigated the oxidizing roasting of stone coal in a laboratory fluidized bed reactor to optimize the roasting method and conditions. The examined parameters included reaction temperature, reaction time and amount and mixing method of additive. The removal of Cl from the generated effluent gas was implemented using CaO as the adsorbent, and comparison was made between the fluidized bed roasting and static roasting in a muffle oven. The {{results show that the}} fluidized roasting <b>is</b> more favorable <b>to</b> leach V 2 O 5 from stone coal, which can shorten roasting time for reaching the maximal leaching rate, while the realized leaching rate is also higher. Comparing the mixing method applied to stone coal and additive, the impregnation method of additive on stone coal not only increased the leaching rate and shortened the roasting time for reaching the maximal leaching rate, but also reduced the amount of additive required. Adding CaO in stone coal roasting sharply decreased the content of Cl-containing gases in flue gas, which can greatly alleviate the possible environmental pollution. The optimal conditions for fluidized bed roasting <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impregnating</b> 6 wt. % additive on coal, adding 3 wt. % CaO and performing roasting at 800 degrees C for 0. 75 h.

60|$|In 1877, {{in pursuance of}} {{this changed}} purpose, Darwin {{published}} his book on 'Forms of Flowers,' in which he dealt closely with the old problem of differently shaped blossoms on plants of the same species. It had long been known, to take a single example, that primroses existed in two forms, the pin-eyed and the thrum-eyed, of which the former has the pin-like summit of the pistil {{at the top of}} the tube, and the stamens concealed half way down its throat; while in the latter these relative positions are exactly reversed, the stamens answering in place to the pistil of the alternative form with geometrical accuracy. As early as 1862 Darwin had shown, in the 'Journal of the Linnean Society,' that this curious arrangement owed its development to the greater security which it afforded for cross-fertilisation, because in this way each flower had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impregnated</b> with the pollen, from a totally distinct blossom, growing on a different individual plant. In a series of successive papers read before the same Society in the years between 1863 and 1868, he had extended a similar course of explanation to the multiform flowers of the flaxes, the loosestrifes, the featherfoil, the auricula, the buckbean, and several other well-known plants. At last, in 1877, he gathered together into one of the now familiar green-covered volumes the whole of his observations on this strange peculiarity, and proved by abundant illustration and experiment that the diversity of form is always due through natural selection to the advantage gained by perfect security of cross-fertilisation, resulting as it invariably does in the production of the finest, strongest, and most successful seedlings. Any variation, however peculiar, which helps to ensure this constant infusion of fresh blood is certain to be favoured in the struggle for life, owing to the superior vitality of the stock it begets. But it is worthy of notice, as showing the extreme minuteness and exhaustiveness of Darwin's method on the small scale, side by side with his extraordinary and unusual power of rising to the very highest and grandest generalisations, that the volume which he devoted to the elucidation of this minor factor in the question of hereditary advantages runs to nearly as many pages as the last edition of the 'Origin of Species' itself. So great was the wealth of observation and experiment which he could lavish upon the solution of a single, small, incidental problem.|$|E

50|$|It is in {{this work}} that Pinar shows her ability to play with {{language}} and create conceits (conceptismo), by showing love’s dual role of providing both pleasure and pain.

This playful use of symbolism {{is one of the}} distinguishing features of Pinar’s poetry. The prevailing theme of her poetry is love, but there is also much ambiguity in her tone. Throughout the centuries, scholars have often speculated about whether this love about which she so frequently writes is platonic or sexual in nature.|$|R
