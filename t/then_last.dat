5|$|On January 30, the poorly {{organised}} Tropical Disturbance 08F developed {{within a}} convergence zone about 325km (200mi) {{to the northeast}} of Apia on the Samoan island of Upolu. Over {{the next few days}} the system remained weak and poorly organized, and was classified as a tropical depression during February 5. The depression then moved westwards, before dissipating on February 9. Tropical Disturbance 10F developed on February 15, about 170km (105mi) {{to the north of the}} Fijian Dependency of Rotuma Island. The system was poorly defined and disorganised, while convection surrounding the system was mostly confined to the southern and eastern flanks of the low level circulation. Over the next few days the disturbance remained weak and was last noted during February 21, while nestled within the Solomon Islands. On March 6, Tropical Depression 11F developed under an upper trough of low pressure about 220km (140mi) to the northeast of Nadi, Fiji. Convection surrounding the depression was displaced to the north of the low level circulation center. The depression remained weak over the next couple of days, and was last noted during March 8. A fairly disorganized tropical disturbance developed during April 6, within a monsoonal convergence zone, about 236km (145mi) to the northeast of Port Vila, Vanuatu. It was initially located within an area of weak vertical windshear, but was expected to move into an area of stronger vertical windshear over the following 24hours and gradually become extratropical. During the next day, as the disturbance moved southwards, it was assigned the designation 14F, before it was dropped by RSMC Nadi during April 8, as convection surrounding the system became sheared and displaced. On April 13, Tropical Disturbance 15F developed within a monsoon trough, about 355km (220mi) to the southeast of Apia, Samoa. The system moved towards the south, with convection surrounding it poorly organised, and displaced to the north of the depression's low level circulation centre. The depression was <b>then</b> <b>last</b> noted, during the next day as Tropical Depression 16F developed into Tropical Cyclone Fili.|$|E
25|$|<b>Then</b> <b>last</b> night {{something}} happened which I can neither explain nor understand. In {{the middle of}} the palms of my hands a red mark appeared, {{about the size of a}} penny, accompanied by acute pain in {{the middle of the}} red marks. The pain was more pronounced in the middle of the left hand, so much so that I can still feel it. Also under my feet I can feel some pain.|$|E
25|$|The {{franchise}} {{was one of}} six {{established for}} the inaugural CPL season in 2013, {{and the only one}} located in the Leeward Islands. The Hawksbills placed fifth in 2013, and <b>then</b> <b>last</b> during the 2014 edition of the CPL, winning three of out its sixteen games during that time. Antiguan Viv Richards coached the team in 2013, but was replaced by Tim Nielsen, an Australian, for the 2014 season. Marlon Samuels, a Jamaican, was the team's captain for both seasons.|$|E

50|$|Upson {{suffered}} a calf injury less than 30 minutes into his West Ham United debut, a 1-0 defeat against Aston Vill. He <b>then</b> <b>lasted</b> just 11 minutes of his comeback match before coming off injured against Tottenham Hotspur in a 4-3 loss at Upton Park in March 2007.|$|R
500|$|Renewal was {{uncertain}} {{until after the}} finale aired. In April, actor Enrico Colantoni, who plays Keith, stated regarding renewal, Unofficially, everyone at CBS and Warner Bros is saying, [...] "Yeah, no worries!" [...] But you know, those are always famous last words. And <b>then</b> <b>last</b> year they told us two days after we wrapped, and they {{got a lot of}} criticism over that. So I know they're not gonna make that mistake again. They're gonna wait until May. Colantoni also expressed optimism towards the show's future on The CW, believing {{that it would be a}} chance for the show to get more exposure. On May 15, before the official press release was announced, it was believed that The CW had ordered 13 episodes of Veronica Mars. Later, it was revealed that the series had been renewed for a 22-episode season, but that the season could be shortened if ratings were poor.|$|E
2500|$|As a consequence, Finnish {{speakers}} {{often have}} problems with pronouncing foreign words which do not obey vowel harmony. For example, olympia is often pronounced olumpia. The position of some loans is unstandardized (e.g. chattailla/chättäillä [...] ) or ill-standardized (e.g. polymeeri, sometimes pronounced polumeeri, and autoritäärinen, which violate vowel harmony). Where a foreign word violates vowel harmony by not using front vowels because {{it begins with a}} neutral vowel, <b>then</b> <b>last</b> syllable generally counts, although this rule is irregularly followed. Experiments indicate that e.g. miljonääri always becomes (front) miljonääriä, but marttyyri becomes equally frequently both marttyyria (back) and marttyyriä (front), even by the same speaker.|$|E
2500|$|Following battery re-generation {{problems}} {{on his car}} that left him unable to finish the event after having led the first 16 laps, Abt spoke of his annoyance and revealed he had some issues with his first car: [...] "But still {{we were in a}} position to at least take a podium here which would have been good points. Still good, and <b>then</b> <b>last</b> lap my car shuts off with a battery failure or whatever. It’s annoying." [...] He was also disappointed over losing the possibility of finishing on the podium, but said it was continually satisfying to compete {{at the front of the}} pack but it felt more satisfying to be the first driver to finish the race: [...] "I don’t know why this always happens to me, so many times. It’s just really annoying because in the end people forget what happened." ...|$|E

60|$|Upon this, Sir William Somerville {{made one}} more {{appeal to the}} {{minister}} to postpone the further discussion of the Irish bill altogether until the Corn Bill had passed the Commons.

60|$|Some years ago, {{this man}} at my feet, whose over-fraught heart is heaving {{as if it}} would burst from his breast, and whose tears are wet upon the dress I wear, was a galley-slave in the North of Italy.

60|$|I had, {{however, the}} further {{intentions}} {{of writing a}} book about the entire group of Australasian Colonies; and in order that I might be enabled to do that with sufficient information, I visited them all.

I was absent in all eighteen months, and think that I did succeed in learning much of the political, social, and material condition of these countries. I wrote my book as I was travelling and brought it back with me to England all but completed in December, 1872.|$|E
