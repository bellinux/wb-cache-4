40|$|ABSTRACT: Four {{commercial}} PEEK systems&mdash;two {{grades of}} neat PEEK and short GF-and CF-fiber composites&mdash;were compression-molded. Compact tension fracture tests were performed, with temperature and specimen thickness as variables. The dependences {{of the critical}} stress intensity factor KQ and of mechanical nonlinearity on these variables are re-ported. The filled systems show both nearly constant KQ and low ductility from &mdash; 90 to + 125 &deg;C. For all materials, KQ varies more slowly with temperature than does the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> <b>Specimen</b> thickness, varied from 0. 29 to 1. 25 cm, has {{a profound effect on}} neat PEEK, as it changes from plane stress to plain strain behavior Thickness has essentially no effect on the composites, which show plane strain behavior over the entire thickness range...|$|E

30|$|Figure  3 {{shows that}} the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of <b>specimen</b> B is {{lower than that of}} {{specimens}} A and C, which indicates that specimen B is more susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement than specimens A and C during immersion for 6  h in 0.2  % APF solution. Consequently, the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement of each specimen was compared with the results for 4 -h immersion. As shown in Figs.  6 and 9, the amount of absorbed hydrogen and the distribution of hydrogen were not dependent on the microstructure of the immersed specimens. Therefore, the significant degradation in the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of <b>specimen</b> B cannot be explained by the amount of absorbed hydrogen or the distribution of hydrogen. Furthermore, the <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> of <b>specimens</b> A and C were almost the same, so that {{it is unlikely that the}} degradation of <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> for <b>specimen</b> B is only due to the interaction of hydrogen with the dynamic phase transformation from the parent phase to the martensite phase.|$|R
30|$|From these results, the {{degradation}} in <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> due to hydrogen absorption for Ni-Ti shape memory alloys with microstructures including the parent phase may be significant, whereas the corrosion of alloys with microstructures including the martensite phase may be significant. Therefore, the significant degradation of <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> for <b>specimen</b> B is probably {{caused by a}} synergistic effect of hydrogen absorption and corrosion. In addition, the effect of corrosion on the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of <b>specimen</b> A was {{less than that of}} specimens B and C; therefore, {{the degradation}} of <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> for <b>specimen</b> A remained small when the immersion time was increased from 4 to 6  h. In the case of cathodic hydrogen charging without corrosion, the interaction of hydrogen with the dynamic phase transformation from the parent phase to the martensite phase is important for evaluation of the hydrogen embrittlement behavior of Ni-Ti shape memory alloys. We have revealed that the relationship between the characteristics of absorbed hydrogen, alloy microstructure, and corrosion behavior should be clarified to evaluate the hydrogen embrittlement behavior of alloys in corrosive environments.|$|R

In the case of aging at room temperature for 24 h after hydrogen charging, the dominant factor that influences the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of the <b>specimen</b> is the amount of hydride. However, dissociation of the hydride by aging at room temperature for 240 h was confirmed in both specimens.

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of <b>specimen</b> C was higher than that of {{specimens}} A and B after 4 -h immersion in 0.2  % APF solution. This suggests that the susceptibility of specimen C to hydrogen embrittlement after 4 -h immersion is lower than that of specimens A and B. The amount of absorbed hydrogen and the distribution of hydrogen were not dependent on the microstructure of the immersed specimens (Figs.  6 and 9); therefore, the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement cannot be explained by the amount of absorbed hydrogen or the distribution of hydrogen. With respect to corrosion, the mass loss of the immersed specimens was also not dependent on the microstructure of the specimens. Moreover, the surface condition of the immersed specimens was not significantly different for the different specimen microstructures. Therefore, it appears that the effect of corrosion on the significant degradation of <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> for <b>specimen</b> B was negligible.|$|R
