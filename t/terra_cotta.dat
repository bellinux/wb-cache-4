5|$|In {{preparation}} for the restoration work, the structural and architectural engineering firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates completed {{an evaluation of the}} building's eastern and southern facades, focusing on its <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> portions. By using ultrasonic testing, engineers were able to evaluate the state of the <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> without further damaging the pieces. Severely cracked or damaged pieces were partially removed and a report was written from these findings. This report provided recommendations for the masonry facade and <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> repair work. Restoration work began in spring 2009 and is scheduled for completion in early 2010. All of the damaged <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> elements have been replaced on the south tower and parapet, and scaffolding has been erected on building's eastern facade in {{preparation for}} further restoration work. Fully restoring the building's exterior <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> pieces and clay roof tiles {{is the first step in}} a long-range $2million repair plan.|$|E
5|$|The Blackstone is a 22-floor {{rectangular}} {{structure and}} its structural steel frame is cased in tile and plaster fireproofing. On the exterior {{south and east}} (front) elevations is a one-story base of pink granite, with high arched openings; it supports the red brick- and terra cotta-trimmed building shaft. Above the granite base are four stories of white, glazed <b>terra</b> <b>cotta.</b> The large windows of {{the second and third}} floor, which once poured natural light into the lobby, ballroom, and restaurants, have mostly been covered for a theater. The majority of the building rises as a 12-story shaft of red brick dotted with white, <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> window surrounds; above this section is a belt course of <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> and two stories of red brick. Above this, the original design included an intermediate <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> cornice topped by a cast-iron railing. This has been removed and replaced with red brick and white glazed brick, flush {{with the rest of the}} building. The mansard roof was originally decorated with small spires around the perimeter, and 2 very tall flagpoles.|$|E
5|$|Testaroli's name {{is based}} upon the testo, a <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> or cast iron cooking device with a hot, flat surface that testaroli is {{traditionally}} cooked on.|$|E
5|$|Amongst {{the major}} attractions of Birbhum are Bakreshwar, Tarapith, Dwarbasini temple at Chondrapur and Patharchapuri. Birbhum has many old temples, {{such as the}} ones at Jaydev Kenduli, Surul and Nanoor, with {{delicate}} decorative tiles made of <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> (burnt clay).|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Pui Tak Center won a $100,000 {{grant from}} the Partners in Preservation, a program {{sponsored}} by American Express and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In preparation for the restoration work, the structural and architectural engineering firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates completed {{an evaluation of the}} building's eastern and southern facades, focusing on its <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> portions. Restoration work began in spring 2009 and is scheduled for completion in early 2010.

5|$|The <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> Spartan {{was removed}} from its base on May 12, 2005. During MSU's 2005 summer semester, the {{intersection}} at which the statue stood was completely redesigned to allow for safer traffic interaction with pedestrians. On Thursday, August 25, 2005, an unveiling of the new bronze Spartan took place. In addition, a Sesquicentennial parade on Saturday, October 8, 2005, concluded with a dedication ceremony at the statue. Meanwhile, the original <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> Spartan was {{moved to a new}} Spartan Stadium annex where it could be displayed safely indoors. Though most members of the MSU community agree that the original statue needs to be sheltered, some alumni and faculty have criticized the inaccessibility of the original statue.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 20th century, Michigan's harsh winters {{had taken a}} toll on the <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> statue, as had {{vandalism}} by fans of MSU's rival school, the University of Michigan. While annual repair work helped stem {{the damage done by}} precipitation, extreme cold, and vandalism, the statue needed more intensive repair.|$|E
5|$|The Bellevue City Hall is a {{government}} office building and city hall in Bellevue, Washington. The current city hall, located in Downtown Bellevue, opened in 2006 after the $121 million renovation of a former Qwest data center. The data center, originally built for Pacific Northwest Bell in 1983, was acquired by the city government in 2002 {{for use by the}} Bellevue Police Department and later approved as the new city hall. It incorporates use of wood interiors and a <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> exterior that has been recognized with several design awards since its opening.|$|E
5|$|According to Méliès's recollections, much of {{the unusual}} cost of A Trip to the Moon {{was due to the}} {{mechanically}} operated scenery and the Selenite costumes in particular, which were made for the film using cardboard and canvas. Méliès himself sculpted prototypes for the heads, feet, and kneecap pieces in <b>terra</b> <b>cotta,</b> and then created plaster molds for them. A specialist in mask-making used these molds to produce cardboard versions for the actors to wear. One of the backdrops for the film, showing the inside of the glass-roofed workshop in which the space capsule is built, was painted to look like the actual glass-roofed studio in which the film was made.|$|E
5|$|All {{buildings}} have been adorned with elaborate carvings and sculptures and {{were supported by}} large stone columns. These stone columns {{can be seen in}} several buildings such as the Lovamahapaya (brazen palace). Drainage systems of these buildings are also well planned, and <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> pipes were used to carry water to drainage pits. Large ponds were attached to some monasteries, such as the Kuttam Pokuna (twin pond). Hospital complexes have also been found close to monasteries. Buildings were constructed using timber, bricks and stones. Stones were used for foundations and columns, while brick were used for walls. Lime mortar was used for plastering walls.|$|E
5|$|Testaroli is {{prepared}} from a batter that is cooked {{on a hot}} flat surface, after which it may be consumed. It is traditionally cooked on a testo, a flat <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> or cast iron cooking surface from which the food's name is derived. It is sometimes cooked further in boiling water and then served. Testaroli is {{sometimes referred to as}} a bread, similar to focaccia in composition, and is sometimes referred to as a crêpe. It may be dressed with pesto sauce or other ingredients such as olive oil, Pecorino cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and garlic. Falsi testaroli al ragu is a similar dish prepared using sliced pasta dough and a ragù sauce.|$|E
5|$|The roof is sharply angled {{toward its}} center, where a wooden cupola tops the building. It was {{completed}} after the building, in 1892. At {{each of the}} square shaped building's four corners are dormers, which serve {{to break up the}} monotony of the otherwise ridged roof. The dormers resemble the cupola, in that they are dormered as well as multi-gabled. The roof has had routine maintenance performed as required. The building's dominant feature, its cupola, sits on an oversized brick base with a <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> belt around its base top. It features blocked openings with multiple arches, double round arches, Corinthian pilasters, and organic corner detailing.|$|E
5|$|Although {{having the}} same floor plan, the House and Senate {{chambers}} are decorated very differently, with the former in <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> and teal colors and the latter in blue and gold. An oval cartouche in the carpet {{at the entrance to}} the House chamber features the state flower, the apple blossom. Presiding over the house is the speaker, whose chair is behind a desk in the center with a plaster and paint version of the state coat of arms. The Senate chamber is somewhat smaller than the House. The president of the Senate is the lieutenant governor, who presides over sessions from a walnut rostrum at the front of the chamber. Both the House and the Senate use computerized voting systems, including wall-mounted screens that allow visitors to follow the voting and both also contain glass tiled ceilings that allow natural light to shine through etched glass panels to better light the room. These ceiling tiles feature the coats-of-arms of each state in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Ninah Cummer and Clara Cummer, {{both now}} widows, died in 1958. Ninah Cummer left her estate, {{including}} her gardens, to the DeEtte Holden Cummer Museum Foundation for a museum to house her art collection. In 1960, the siblings' homes were both demolished {{in order to}} build the museum. Clara and Waldo's property was sold and now houses the Northeast Florida chapter of the American Red Cross and the Cummer's education center, Art Connections. Parts of the gardens were also destroyed during this demolition. The new building was designed by Saxelbye and Powell and constructed in 1961. It featured an Art Deco façade and an inner courtyard that was paved with the <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> tiles of the Cummers' old roof. One room from the original Cummer home, known as the Tudor Room, was preserved and incorporated into the new museum. The Cummer Museum of Art & Gardens, then named The Cummer Gallery, opened on November 11, 1961.|$|E
5|$|The {{years of}} neglect {{following}} {{the closing of the}} hotel took a toll on the building's appearance with both the interior and exterior facade crumbling. In 2005, it was announced that the hotel would undergo a $112million renovation and acquisition with a planned opening in 2007 in a deal between Marriott International/Renaissance Hotels and Sage Hospitality, a Denver, Colorado-based company. The hotel's restoration process was quite lengthy because of the extensive interior damage. $22million of the expected $112million was the cost associated with the acquisition. Sage sought $22million in tax increment financing from the Chicago Community Development Commission. They eventually were approved for $18million in tax-increment financing. The final cost of the restoration came to $128million, of which the city of Chicago provided $13.5million for street-front improvement, including the restoration and recasting of over 10,000 pieces of decorative <b>terra</b> <b>cotta,</b> and federal historical tax credits because the building is a historical landmark. The Chicago Landmark status necessitated renovation oversight by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks.|$|E
5|$|Spring Street, {{a typical}} {{commercial}} 19th century corridor, {{is the primary}} roadway within the district. Most buildings along Spring Street are Italianate and eclectic Victorian. The structure vary between two and three stories tall, with brick as the most common building material. The 100 block is the closest to the Ohio River and has seen the most demolition. It contains the Old Strauss Hotel {{at the corner of}} Riverside Drive, a three-story Italianate hostelry with a corbeled cornice and arched windows. The buildings on the 200 block are mostly Italianate style buildings, the most notable being the old Elk's Club structure (a three-story highly decorated glazed brick building) and the Bensinger's Building (a 1920s commercial building of pressed brick and crenelated parapet). There is more diverse architecture on the 300-block, with a 19th-century Masonic Temple, the LaRose Theatre (a 1920s orange glazed brick structure with <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> trim), Horner's Novelty (which had to be rebuilt after the worst fire in Jeffersonville's history), and Schimpff's Confectionery, a candy store that opened in 1891 that now also features a small candy museum. More Italianate structures are on the 400 block, but its most important structure is the 1907 Citizens National Bank Building, which is stone Classical Revival with large eagles for adornment. The block also holds the regional office for the local Boy Scouts of America council. Warder Park is located {{on the east side of}} the 500 block and features a Classical Revival Masonic Temple that used for most of the 20th Century.|$|E
25|$|A high parapet extends {{above the}} fourth floor and it is {{composed}} of a more coarse brick than {{is the rest of}} the facade. This is the scar remaining from a large cornice, either made of pressed tin or <b>Terra</b> <b>cotta,</b> that was removed from the building after a 1913 fire, harming its architectural integrity greatly. The pilasters continue through the parapet and the central pilasters and recessed within a brick equilateral arch is a <b>Terra</b> <b>cotta</b> wheel window design flanked at the base by <b>Terra</b> <b>cotta</b> fillets filling out the base of the arch.|$|E
25|$|The main {{entrance}} uses an arched Gibbs-style surround. The building's trim materials {{show up in}} the form of solid stone balustrades that curl to form newel posts at the sidewalk, and <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> quoins. The rear facade is less detailed, with <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> used only for the coping of the stepped cornice; stone and brick are used everywhere else.|$|E
25|$|The Detroit Fire Department Headquarters is a five-story Neoclassical {{building}} with a steel frame designed by Hans Gehrke and built in 1929. The building is constructed of dark red brick trimmed with <b>terra</b> <b>cotta,</b> sitting on a grey granite bulkhead. The Larned facade is divided into six bays; the four central bays contain arched openings, trimmed with <b>terra</b> <b>cotta,</b> housing fire engines. The eastern bay contains {{the entrance to the}} building. A <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> beltcourse separates the first story from those above; these upper stories still contain the original double-hung windows. The Washington Boulevard facade of much the same as the one on Larned.|$|E
25|$|The Austin A. Bell Building is a four story {{structure}} of brick with <b>Terra</b> <b>cotta</b> ornamentation. Both brick and <b>Terra</b> <b>cotta</b> {{are of a}} distinct reddish-orange hue and the mortar joints are narrow. Its architect, Elmer H. Fisher would later design many of the buildings in the Pioneer Square district of Seattle. While Fisher's designs were predominantly Richardsonian, the Bell Building is less so, with several Gothic elements thrown into the mix.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Greek {{custom of}} placing <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> miniatures of their {{furniture}} in children's graves {{gives us a}} good idea of its style and design. The Greeks normally ate while seated on chairs; benches were used for banquets. The tables, high for normal meals and low for banquets, were initially rectangular in shape. By the 4th century BC, the usual table was round, often with animal-shaped legs (for example lion's paws). Loaves of flat bread could be used as plates, but <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> bowls were more common.|$|E
25|$|Bayard Building, (now Bayard-Condict Building), 65–69 Bleecker Street, New York City (1898). Sullivan's only {{building}} in New York, with a glazed <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> curtain wall expressing the steel structure behind it.|$|E
25|$|From {{its base}} in clay sewer pipe and <b>terra</b> <b>cotta,</b> the company {{expanded}} into brick production and then branched out to dinnerware in the 1930s, with its Franciscan and Catalina lines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Terra</b> <b>cotta</b> works (architectural) by Prestini: Moose Lodge (Clayton, Wash.); Felts Field Air National Guard Hangar, the Paulsen Medical and Dental Building, Davenport Hotel, The Rookery Building (Spokane, Wash.); Martin Hall - EWU campus (Cheney, Wash.).|$|E
25|$|The Graphic Arts Building was {{designed}} and built in 1926 by Murphy and Burns. It features a striking <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> exterior. The original tenants were graphic art professionals, including a commercial engraver, a photographer, and art studios.|$|E
25|$|Since 1976, the {{building}} has undergone a series of structural, backstage and front of house improvements. In 2015, repair of the front fascade and signage began, including work to replace bricks and <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> damaged by water.|$|E
25|$|The {{architectural}} <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> used {{on these}} structures unifies {{the appearance of}} the district. The district is significant for its architecture, its commercial history, its ethnic heritage, and for its association with Philip Breitmeyer, mayor of Detroit from 1909 to 1911.|$|E
25|$|Considered {{by some to}} be Chicago's most {{beautiful}} hotel dining room, the Palm Room featured an Italian fountain after a model by Donatello as its centerpiece. It was built of cream-colored stone, Rookwood tile, and gray <b>terra</b> <b>cotta,</b> while featuring high-beamed ceilings.|$|E
25|$|The Penobscot Building on Fort Street is a thirteen-story {{office tower}} of brick, <b>terra</b> <b>cotta,</b> and {{limestone}} {{with a flat}} roof, in 1905–1906 and designed by Donaldson and Meier. This building {{was the first of}} three interconnected Penobscot Buildings constructed for William H. Murphy of the Simon J. Murphy Company. The lower three stories of the building are faced in limestone, the middle seven in brick, and the upper three in <b>terra</b> <b>cotta.</b> The facade is divided into five bays, each with a pair of double-hung windows. Corinthian column piers front the eleventh and twelfth stories, and the original building cornice is still in place. The original tenants of the first floor were the Detroit Savings Bank and the Detroit Trust Company.|$|E
25|$|The {{project was}} to {{completely}} restore and preserve the facades. The <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> was fully replaced and the schist stone was replaced where deteriorated and fully re-pointed. In addition, major structural flaws were discovered within the walls. The project was both Cosmetic and a difficult and intricate Structural Renovation.|$|E
25|$|St. Nicholas of Myra Church (1882–1883), East 10th Street, A {{brick and}} <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> {{formerly}} the Memorial Chapel of St. Mark’s in the Bowery, {{one of the}} city’s oldest Episcopal parishes, as the gift of Rutherford Stuyvesant, a descendant of the Dutch governor Peter Stuyvesant, in memory of his wife.|$|E
25|$|The lower {{two floors}} of the Ford Building has piers an Ionic columns {{flanking}} a central entry. The exterior is covered with terra cotta; bands run {{above and below the}} third floor and another band of <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> divides the sixteenth and seventeenth floors. The windows of the top floor are arched.|$|E
25|$|Another eating {{area was}} the Dutch Room (or German Grill). It was {{noted for its}} {{enormous}} red brick supports which supported the heavy-beamed and paneled ceilings. The room was furnished with wooden and leather chairs and had blue tiled walls and <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> tiled floors. It was here that electric grilling started in Chicago.|$|E
25|$|Sadovo-Triumphalnaya, 4 by Rosenfeld and Suris has {{a quality}} almost as good. Walls, cut deeply by bay windows and {{horizontal}} cornices, are finished in granite and <b>terra</b> <b>cotta.</b> Overall image is so heavyweight, it projects luxury {{as effectively as}} Rybitsky's work. A nice design feature is {{a second set of}} stairs for the servants.|$|E
25|$|The lawns {{contained}} many sculptural {{pieces in}} bronze, <b>terra</b> <b>cotta,</b> marble and stone. Depicting scenes from mythology, nymphs and cherubs, {{the collection is}} an informal contrast to the strong and robust lines of the French-style château. The driveways and pathways are lined with lush arborvitae, planted by the Tinneys {{a few years after}} they moved into Belcourt.|$|E
25|$|St. Nicholas of Myra Church – {{designated}} in 2008, this {{lively and}} picturesque brick and <b>terra</b> <b>cotta</b> church complex {{was constructed in}} 1882-83 as the Memorial Chapel of St. Mark's Parish. The church and its attached school building were designed by James Renwick, Jr. (1818-1895), {{one of the most}} prominent architects in nineteenth century New York.|$|E
