5|$|The Central Committee (CC) is the CPV's most {{powerful}} institution. It delegates {{some of its}} powers to the Secretariat and the Politburo {{when it is not}} in session. When the Vietnam War ended in 1975, the Vietnamese leadership, led by Lê Duẩn, began to centralise power. This policy continued until the 6th National Congress, when Nguyễn Văn Linh took power. Linh pursued a policy of economic and political decentralisation. The party and state bureaucracy opposed Linh's reform initiatives; because of this, Linh tried to win the support of provincial leaders. This caused the powers of the provincial chapters of the CPV to increase in the 1990s. The CPV lost its power to appoint or dismiss provincial-level officials in the 1990s; this is proven by the fact that Võ Văn Kiệt tried to wrestle this power back to the centre during the 1990s without success. These developments led to the provincialisation of the Central Committee; for example, more and more CC members have a background in provincial party work. Because of these changes, power in Vietnam has become increasingly devolved. The number of Central Committee members with a provincial background increased from a low of 15.6 percent in 1982 to a high of 41 percent in 2000. The current President of the Socialist Republic, Trương Tấn Sang, was directly elected from the provinces at the 8th Party Congress, held 1996. Because of the devolution of power, the powers of the Central Committee have increased substantially; for instance, when a two-thirds majority of the Politburo voted in favour of retaining Lê Khả Phiêu as General Secretary (the leader of Vietnam), the Central Committee voted against the Politburo's motion and voted unanimously in favour of removing Lê Khả Phiêu from his post of General Secretary. The Central Committee did this because the majority of its members were of provincial background, or were working in the provinces; because of this, these members were the first to feel <b>the</b> <b>pinch</b> when the economy began to stagnate during Lê Khả Phiêu's rule.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pinch</b> District or just <b>The</b> <b>Pinch</b> {{is an area}} of Uptown, Memphis {{that played}} an {{important}} role in local immigration patterns beginning in the early 19th century. Memphis' first business district, <b>the</b> <b>Pinch</b> encompassed all of Memphis north of Adams Street, from the River to Third Street. The name was originally a term of derision, referring to emaciated Irish immigrants who fled the Irish Potato Famine. Later, Italian, Russian, Greek and, especially, Jewish immigrants also called it home before migrating to more affluent sections of the city.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1947, two UK teams {{carried out}} small {{experiments}} and began building {{a series of}} ever-larger experiments. When the Huemul results hit the news (see below), James L. Tuck, a UK physicist working at Los Alamos, introduced <b>the</b> <b>pinch</b> concept in the US and produced a series of machines known as the Perhapsatron. The Soviet Union, unbeknownst to the West, was also building a series of similar machines. All of these devices quickly demonstrated a series of instabilities when <b>the</b> <b>pinch</b> was applied. This broke up the plasma column long before it reached the densities and temperatures required for fusion.|$|E

25|$|John Bryan Taylor took up {{the issue}} and began a {{detailed}} theoretical study of the concept, publishing a groundbreaking 1974 article on the topic. He demonstrated that as the magnetic field that generated <b>the</b> <b>pinch</b> was relaxing, it interacted with the pre-existing stabilising fields, creating a self-stable magnetic field. The phenomenon was driven by the system's desire to preserve magnetic helicity, which suggested {{a number of ways}} to improve the confinement time.|$|E
25|$|When {{the meeting}} concluded, {{most of the}} {{researchers}} quickly turned out papers saying why Teller's concerns {{did not apply to}} their particular device. <b>The</b> <b>pinch</b> machines did not use magnetic fields in this way at all, while the mirror and stellarator seemed to have various ways out. This was soon followed by a paper by Martin David Kruskal and Martin Schwarzschild discussing pinch machines, however, which demonstrated instabilities in those devices were inherent to the design.|$|E

The direction of <b>the</b> <b>pinched</b> hysteresis loop can be controlled. This graphical modelling method provides an alternative to describe the behaviour of memristors without deriving the coupled non-linear differential equations typically required for physical memristors. The method has been successfully applied to model the Hewlett–Packard memristor device...|$|R
25|$|Investigations {{demonstrated}} {{both were}} caused by the same underlying mechanism. When <b>the</b> <b>pinch</b> current was applied, any area of the gas that had a slightly higher density would create a slightly stronger magnetic field and collapse faster than the surrounding gas. This caused the localised area to have higher density, which created an even stronger pinch, and a runaway reaction would follow. The quick collapse in a single area would cause the whole column to break up.|$|E
25|$|The {{occurrence}} of π in the Mandelbrot set {{was discovered by}} David Boll in 1991. He found that when looking at <b>the</b> <b>pinch</b> points of the Mandelbrot set, the number of iterations needed for the point (−3/4, ε) before escaping, multiplied by ε, was equal to π. Based on this initial finding, Aaron Klebanoff developed a further test near another pinch point (1/4 + ε, 0) in the Mandelbrot set {{and found that the}} number of iterations times the square root of ε was equal to π.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{stabilising}} {{force was}} lower than the force available in <b>the</b> <b>pinch,</b> it lasted considerably longer. It appeared that a reactor could be built that would approach the Lawson criterion from a different direction; through extended confinement times rather than increased density. This {{was similar to the}} stellarator approach in concept, and although it would have lower field strength than those machines, the energy needed to maintain the confinement was much lower. Today this approach is known as the reversed field pinch (RFP) and has been a field of continued study.|$|E

25|$|Spitzer's idea won {{funding and}} he began work on the {{stellarator}} under the code name Project Matterhorn. His work {{led to the creation}} of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. Tuck returned to LANL and arranged local funding to build his machine. By this time, however, it was clear that all of <b>the</b> <b>pinch</b> machines were suffering from the same issues involving stability, and progress stalled. In 1953, Tuck and others suggested a number of solutions to the stability problems. This led to the design of a second series of pinch machines, led by the UK ZETA and Sceptre devices.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of Bennett {{fracture}} are {{instability of}} the CMC joint of the thumb, accompanied by pain and weakness of <b>the</b> <b>pinch</b> grasp. Characteristic signs include pain, swelling, and ecchymosis {{around the base}} of the thumb and thenar eminence, and especially over the CMC joint of the thumb. Physical examination demonstrates instability of the CMC joint of the thumb. The patient will often manifest a weakened ability to grasp objects or perform such tasks as tying shoes and tearing a piece of paper. Other complaints include intense pain experienced upon catching the thumb on an object, such as when reaching into a pants pocket.|$|E
25|$|The idea {{of using}} steady {{alternating}} current (AC) to create <b>the</b> <b>pinch</b> had a serious limitation. AC power drops to zero voltage twice per cycle, and during this time it would not induce a current in the plasma, briefly ending confinement. Direct current (DC) power avoids this issue. Another key point was that the current in the plasma also heated it. In the original designs, a weak pinch current was used for confinement while the external heaters slowly heated the plasma. But if the current was also used as the heat source there was no practical limit to the heating rate, which was limited only {{by the power of}} the pulse. Combining the two concepts, a new reactor design emerged where the system operated in brief but powerful pulses. Such a machine would demand a very large power supply.|$|E

500|$|Frustrated at {{the lack}} of {{progress}} and feeling <b>the</b> <b>pinch</b> of the American-British-Dutch sanctions, Japan prepared for war. On 20 November a new government under Hideki Tojo presented an interim proposal as its final offer. It called for the end of American aid to China and for the supply of oil and other resources to Japan. In exchange Japan promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw its forces from southern Indochina. The American counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific powers. That meant Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in China, or seizing the natural resources it needed in the Dutch East Indies by force;, listing various military and diplomatic developments, observes that [...] "the threat to Japan was not purely economic." [...] the Japanese military did not consider the former an option, and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war.|$|E
500|$|The first {{homotopy}} group, or fundamental group, π1(X) of a (path connected) {{topological space}} X thus begins with continuous maps from a pointed circle (S1,s) to the pointed space (X,x), where maps from one pair to another map s into x.

Just as one point is distinguished, so one class is distinguished: all maps (or curves) homotopic to the constant map S1↦x are called null homotopic. The classes become an abstract algebraic group with the introduction of addition, defined via an [...] "equator pinch". This pinch maps the equator of a pointed sphere (here a circle) to the distinguished point, producing a [...] "bouquet of spheres" [...] — two pointed spheres joined at their distinguished point. The two maps to be added map the upper and lower spheres separately, agreeing on the distinguished point, and composition with <b>the</b> <b>pinch</b> gives the sum map.|$|E
