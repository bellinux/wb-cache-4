40|$|The {{accidental}} melting {{of radioactive}} sources hidden inside metal scrap containers can produce severe environmental harm. Modern melting facilities {{are equipped with}} portals measuring radiation levels. Nonetheless, sources can pass undiscovered when shielded inside shells of high density material, such as lead. From time to time indeed some radioactive sources pass undetected through the controls at foundries entrance. Once melted they caused enormous damages to the steel mills, contaminating all the production line. The muon tomography technique allows to discriminate high- Z materials measuring multiple scattering of cosmic ray muons inside matter. Therefore this technique {{can be used to}} analyze a <b>truck</b> <b>container</b> searching for high-density source shields. We report here the results about simulation studies of a muon tomography portal. Within the Mu-Steel European project we developed the prototype design, the three-dimensional images reconstruction software and the high density material identification algorithm.

Communication means will be integrated into the container to provide world-wide communication via voice, data transmission and fax. Standard telephone lines (ISDN) areused where available. Cellular phone (GSM, D-net) is used where digital telephone lines are not available at the position of the container. Inmarsat B high speed satellite communication is used wherever infrastructure is poor and other means of communication are not available. In this way the data acquired by the measurement systems can be transferred to remote computers by file transfer. This facilitates further evaluation of the data in an operations center.

40|$|More {{frequent}} vehicle {{movements are}} required for moving containers in a local area due to low unit volume that a single vehicle can handle compared with vessels and rails involved in the container supply chain. For this reason, truck operations for moving containers significantly affect not only transportation cost itself but also product price. They have inherent operational inefficiencies associated with empty container movements and container processes at facilities such as warehouses, distribution centers and intermodal terminals. One critical issue facing the trucking industry is the pressing need for truck routing plans that reduce such inefficiencies. Hence, this dissertation proposes to apply the concept of sharing resources, which is an emerging economic model, to container truck operations in order to resolve this issue. Two shareable resources – vehicles and containers – are considered. This study extends the literature on routing and scheduling problems that arise from container movements, and examines the possible benefits of sharing resources across customers. A series of <b>truck</b> <b>container</b> routing and scheduling problems were developed by assuming different levels of resource sharing among; (1) customers of one trucking operator, (2) customers across collaborations of multiple operators, and (3) customers over multi-day operations. To enable a trucking company to operate its fleet under a shared resource environment, two operational strategies – street turning and decoupling operations – together with temporal precedence constraints – {{in addition to the}} time constraints that are typically included in the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) – were adopted to address the proposed problems. Two meta-heuristic algorithms based on a variable neighborhood search (VNS) scheme were developed to solve the proposed problems, including temporal precedence constraints – which are computationally more expensive – for real-world applications. To address flexible time windows resulting from temporal precedence constraints, a novel feasibility check algorithm was developed. Results from a series of numerical experiments confirm that the proposed approach leverages the advantages of resource sharing, and the meta-heuristic algorithms are efficient solution approaches for each problem with the targeted resource sharing. Consequently, this dissertation offers a platform {{for the development of a}} decision-support tool for drayage companies by applying three different levels of resource sharing into their operations...|$|E
40|$|Every year 310 000 {{containers}} are {{transported by}} rail into City Deep and Kazerne container terminals. By 2020, this number should increase to 500 000. (City of Johannesburg Transportation Department, 2009, 1) Although Transnet owned railway yards and <b>truck</b> <b>container</b> depots are a huge economic drive in Johannesburg, {{much of this}} space is disused and degenerate. and Kazerne. This 130 hectares of land is intended to meet a future demand of medium-rated space for containers. The surrounding processing industries are also forecast to grow in capacity and size. (City of Johannesburg Transportation Department, 2009, 14). What lacks amongst these expansive terrains, is any form of supporting facility, that which aids the labour force, the drivers of massive machinery, those which keep containers moving, the modern-day slave to globalization. The labour force will in the future, increase with the additional container depot space. The number of container trucks which transport these containers will consequently increase. A pinnacle ‘cog’ in the mechanism that is container transportation via road in Southern Africa, is City Deep and Kazerne, yet neither area yields any place regarding trucking maintenance. The road conditions of the area are subsequently threadbare and dilapidated with a great lack of coherence, signage, systematic movement and communication. Transnet previously had sole rights to freight transport from Durban, Cape Town and Port Elizabeth into Johannesburg. Currently local road haul activity is now controlled {{by a variety of}} logistics companies. As a result, To make use of the undeveloped spaces of City Deep would be to ‘infill’ vacancies, assisting in the promotion of the idea of a compact city. (Jenks, Burton & Williams, 1996) The compact city draws parallels to the notion of the ‘resilient city’ in that transportation and overall infrastructure costs decrease. (South African Cities Network, 2011) The proposals of industrial or commercial activity in this area would result in the promotion of the economic growth of Johannesburg. These ‘pockets’ of land surrounding the marshalling yards and cargo depots are ideally located in that they exist within close proximity to the CBD. Transnet has proposed the expansion of its inter-modal container terminal Of Kazerne, along with road infrastructure and lighting masts across both City Deep This thesis researches the amoung other things the specifics of a structure which has been designed to serve as a consistent resource, to give to a somewhat exploited and neglected group of transient people. The building centred primarily around the nature of a road, the massive turning circles of trucks and safe parking zones. Its accessibility and safe daytime character to provide assistance to truck drivers and additionally to City Deep service staff with access to hot meals, showers, laundry facilities, financial and medical assistance, as well as emotional support. It primary focus is truck maintenance. The facilities’ importance reveals itself in that it acts as a catalytic point in this “terrain vague’, in moving towards positive future transformations of the natural landscape each container terminal acts independently as a smaller-scale operation. The loss of coherence and depot communication within City Deep prevails. Instead of one large container terminal, City Deep and Spoornet’s Kazerne are both made up of various components which work independently from each other. This document serves to investigate the feasibility of restoring use into this terrain, a use which is simultaneously beneficial to surrounding communities, an expanding container terminal and the environment in which it wildly lies...|$|E
