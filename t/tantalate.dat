The intensity dependence of the photoconductivity shows the applicability of a one-center charge transport model for high doping concentrations, while for low doping concentrations a more sophisticated model is needed. The validity of a one-center model is exemplarily verified for a crystal doped with 0. 51 mol % Cr over a wide intensity range using a holographic method.
