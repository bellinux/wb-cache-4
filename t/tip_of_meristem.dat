We show that, the DNA ploidy of Hyoscyamus muticus, treated with Colchicine can be evaluated using flow cytometry. In addition we also report reliable morphological markers to identify putative tetraploids in this species. Although, tetraploidy was induced using this technique, mixoploid plants were also observed among the Egyptian henbane plants.

40|$|The shoot apical {{meristem}} (SAM) {{is a collection}} of stem cells that resides at the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> each shoot and provides the cells of the shoot.

40|$|A long-standing {{question}} in {{plants and animals}} is how spatial patterns are maintained within stem cell niches despite ongoing cell divisions. Here we address how, during shoot meristem formation in Arabidopsis thaliana, the three apical cell layers acquire stem cell identity. Using a sensitized mutant screen, we identified miR 394 as a mobile signal produced by the surface cell layer (the protoderm) that confers stem cell competence to the distal meristem by repressing the F box protein LEAF CURLING RESPONSIVENESS. This repression is required to potentiate signaling from underneath the stem cells by the transcription factor WUSCHEL, maintaining stem cell pluripotency. The interaction of two opposing signaling centers provides a mechanistic framework of how stem cells are localized at the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the <b>meristem.</b> Although the constituent cells change, the surface layer provides a stable point of reference in the self-organizing meristem.

40|$|Shoot apical meristems are {{stem cell}} niches that balance {{proliferation}} with {{the incorporation of}} daughter cells into organ primordia.

40|$|All aerial {{organs are}} {{produced}} from shoot meristems, which are dynamic self-sustaining structures {{located at the}} growing <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> shoots. Shoot <b>meristems</b> are subdivided into discrete domains with distinct functions. A population of stem cells is maintained in the central zone (CZ), while organogenesis occurs in the peripheral zone (PZ). In the core <b>of</b> the <b>meristem,</b> the rib meristem produces the pith of the stem. On the flanks <b>of</b> the shoot <b>meristem</b> a small strip of lateral organ boundary cells mediates {{the separation of the}} lateral organ from the meristem. Proper communication between these zones and the lateral organ boundary is essential for meristem integrity and function. Understanding the mechanisms that control shoot meristem fate and integrity will shed light on the mechanisms that control the patterning of the shoot. The KNOTTED 1 -Like HOMEOBOX (KNOX) transcription factor (TF) SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) physically interacts with two related BELL 1 -like homeodomain (BLH) proteins called PENNYWISE (PNY) and POUND-FOOLISH (PNF) to regulate processes that maintain meristem cell fate. Genetic studies indicate that STM-PNY/PNF also regulates boundary function and flower meristem identity during inflorescence development. Studies from the second chapter of this thesis indicate that communication between PNY/PNF and the lateral organ boundary is essential for maintaining meristem integrity as well as controlling inflorescence patterning events. Based on genetic studies, it is unclear if STM and PNY/PNF regulate developmental processes, such as stem cell homeostasis, boundary function and flower meristem identity, directly or indirectly. Experimental evidence from chapter two suggests that STM but not PNY/PNF directly regulates a gene, which encodes a protein that controls stem cell homeostasis. In the CZ and PZ <b>of</b> the shoot <b>meristem,</b> PNY-STM act to negatively regulate lateral organ boundary genes. However, in the absence of PNY/PNF function, STM functions to specify lateral organ boundary identity on the flanks <b>of</b> the shoot <b>meristem.</b> Although PNY/PNF indirectly regulates flower specification via the lateral organ boundary, studies in chapter two suggest that these BLH proteins and at least one KNOX protein directly regulates an early flower meristem identity gene. Results from this thesis, indicate that the spatial expression patterns and formation of specific KNOX-BLH complexes is essential for maintaining meristem cell fate, integrity and flower meristem identity. Furthermore, PNY/PNF and STM act to regulate these processes in an indirect and direct manner to ensure meristem integrity and function is maintained...|$|R

40|$|In plants, {{the shoot}} apical {{meristem}} contains {{the stem cells}} and {{is responsible for the}} generation of all aerial organs. Mechanistically, organogenesis is associated with an auxin-dependent local softening of the epidermis. This has been proposed to be sufficient to trigger outgrowth, because the epidermis is thought to be under tension and stiffer than internal tissues in all the aerial part of the plant. However, this has not been directly demonstrated in the shoot apical meristem. Here we tested this hypothesis in Arabidopsis using indentation methods and modeling. We considered two possible scenarios: either the epidermis does not have unique properties and the meristem behaves as a homogeneous linearly-elastic tissue, or the epidermis is under tension and the meristem exhibits the response of a shell under pressure. Large indentation depths measurements with a large <b>tip</b> (~size <b>of</b> the <b>meristem)</b> were consistent with a shell-like behavior. This also allowed us to deduce a value of turgor pressure, estimated at 0. 82 ± 0. 16 MPa. Indentation with atomic force microscopy provided local measurements of pressure in the epidermis, further confirming the values obtained from large deformations. Altogether, our data demonstrate that the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem behaves like a shell under a MPa range pressure and support a key role for the epidermis in shaping the shoot apex...|$|R

40|$|Plant {{development}} {{depends on}} the activity of various types <b>of</b> <b>meristems</b> that generate organs such as leaves and floral organs throughout the life cycle. Grass species produce complex inflorescences and unique flowers. The grass inflorescence is composed {{of different types of}} branches, including a specialized branch called a spikelet. The spikelet is a special unit of the inflorescence and forms one to several florets, depending on the species. In the floret, floral organs such as perianth organs, carpels and stamens are formed. In Arabidopsis, because the inflorescence meristem (IM) forms the floral meristems (FMs) directly on its flanks, the change <b>of</b> <b>meristem</b> fate is relatively simple. In contrast, in grasses, different types <b>of</b> <b>meristem,</b> such as the IM, the branch meristem (BM), the spikelet pair meristem (SPM) in some grasses, the spikelet meristem (SM) and the FM, are responsible for the elaboration of their complex inflorescences and flowers.

40|$|Flowering {{plants have}} {{developed}} {{many ways to}} arrange their flowers. A flower-bearing branch or system of branches is called an inflorescence. The number of flowers that an inflorescence contains ranges from a single flower to endless flower-clusters. Over the past centuries, botanists have classified inflorescences based on their morphology, {{which has led to}} an unfortunate maze of complex botanical terminology. With the rise of molecular developmental biology, research has become increasingly focused on how inflorescences develop, rather than on their morphology. It is the decisions taken by groups of stem cells at the growing <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> shoots, called <b>meristems,</b> on when and where to produce a flower or a shoot that specify the course of inflorescence development. Modelling is a helpful aid to follow the consequences of these decisions for inflorescence development. The so-called transient model can produce the broad inflorescence types: cyme, raceme, and panicle, into which most inflorescences found in nature can be classified. The analysis of several inflorescence branching mutants has led to a solid understanding of cymose inflorescence development in petunia (Petunia hybrida). The cyme of petunia is a distinct body plan compared with the well-studied racemes of Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum, which provides an excellent opportunity to study evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) related questions.

It was found that the extract has no clastogenic or mutagenic activities, mitotic index decreased mildly compared with the control. Frequency of chromosomal aberrations showed no significance in all concentrations at time of exposure. Most aberrations of the dividing cells were disturbance of chromosomes.

The size <b>of</b> the shoot <b>meristem</b> is tightly controlled by a feedback loop, which involves the homeodomain transcription factor WUSCHEL (WUS) and the CLAVATA (CLV) proteins. This regulatory circuit is further fine-tuned by morphogenic signals such as hormones and sugars. Results Here we show that {{a family of four}} plant-specific proteins, encoded by the FANTASTIC FOUR (FAF) genes, has the potential to regulate shoot meristem size in Arabidopsis thaliana. FAF 2 and FAF 4 are expressed in the centre <b>of</b> the shoot <b>meristem,</b> overlapping with the site of WUS expression. Consistent with a regulatory interaction between the FAF gene family and WUS, our experiments indicate that the FAFs can repress WUS, which ultimately leads to an arrest <b>of</b> <b>meristem</b> activity in FAF overexpressing lines. The finding that meristematic expression of FAF 2 and FAF 4 is under negative control by CLV 3 further supports the hypothesis that the FAFs are modulators of the genetic circuit that regulates the meristem.

Seeds of Cicer were germinated in polluted soil sites such as T 1 (Garden Soil, Control); T 2 (Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited (BHEL) -Industrial); T 3 (BHEL-Agricultural); T 4 (Bijouli-Industrial); T 5 (Bijouli-Agricultural). The effect of soil polluted with the heavy metals was analyzed by studying the percentage of seed germination, radicle length (RL), mitotic index (MI) and chromosomal aberrations (CAs) in root tip meristems. The results revealed that polluted soil with heavy metals T 2 (BHEL-Industrial site) and T 4 (Bijouli-Industrial site) had a significant impeding effect on the root meristem activity in Cicer as noticed by the reduction in seed germination percentage and RL compared to the control. Additionally, the variation in the percentage of mitotic abnormalities was observed. In general, increased percentage of chromosomal aberrations was observed in root <b>tip</b> cells <b>of</b> seedlings grown in polluted soil. Among these abnormalities laggards, bridges, stickiness, precocious separation and fragments were the most common. The obtained results demonstrated that heavy metal polluted soils led to a significant MI reduction and CA increase in root <b>tip</b> <b>meristems</b> <b>of</b> Cicer...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{must develop}} {{efficient}} root architectures to secure access to nutrients {{and water in}} soil. This is achieved dur-ing plant development {{through a series of}} expansion and branching processes, mostly in the proximity <b>of</b> root apical <b>meristems,</b> where the plant senses the environment and explores immediate regions of the soil. We have developed a new approach to study the dynamics <b>of</b> root <b>meristem</b> distribution in soil, using the relationship between the increase in root length density and the root meristem density. Initiated at the seed, the location <b>of</b> root <b>meristems</b> in barley seedlings was shown to propagate, wave-like, through the soil, leaving behind a permanent network of roots for the plant to acquire water and nutrients. Data from observations on barley roots were used to construct mathematical models to describe the density of root mer-istems in space. These models suggested that the morphol-ogy of the waves <b>of</b> <b>meristems</b> was a function of specific root developmental processes. The waves <b>of</b> <b>meristems</b> observed in root systems of barley seedlings exploring the soil might represent a more general and fundamental aspect of plant rooting strategies for securing soil resources.

40|$|Meristems {{provide new}} cells to produce organs {{throughout}} {{the life of}} a plant, and their continuous activity depends on regulatory genes that balance the proliferation <b>of</b> <b>meristem</b> cells with their recruitment to organogenesis. During flower development, this balance is shifted towards organogenesis, causing the meristem to terminate after producing a genetic-ally determined number of organs. In Arabidopsis, WUSCHEL (WUS) specifies the self-renewing cells at the core <b>of</b> the shoot <b>meristems</b> and is a key target in the control <b>of</b> <b>meristem</b> stability. The development of a determinate floral meristem is initiated by APETALA 1 / CAULIFLOWER (AP 1 /CAL) and LEAFY (LFY). The latter activates AGAMOUS (AG), partly in co-operation with WUS. AG then directs the development of the inner-most floral organs {{and at the same time}} antagonizes WUS to terminate the meristem, although the mechan-ism of WUS repression remains unknown. All these genes participate in a series of regulatory feedback loops that maintain stable expression patterns or pro-mote sharp developmental transitions. Although the regulators <b>of</b> <b>meristem</b> maintenance and determinacy in Arabidopsis are widely conserved, their interactions may vary in other species.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about how the size <b>of</b> <b>meristem</b> cells is {{regulated}} and whether it participates in the control <b>of</b> <b>meristem</b> size in plants. Here, we report our findings on shoebox (shb), a mild gibberellin (GA) deficient rice mutant that has a short root meristem size. Quantitative analysis of cortical cell length and number indicates that shb has shorter, rather than fewer, cells in the root meristem until around the fifth day after sowing, from which the number of cortical cells is also reduced. These defects can be either corrected by exogenous application of bioactive GA or induced in wild-type roots by a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of paclobutrazol on GA biosynthesis, suggesting that GA deficiency is {{the primary cause of}} shb mutant phenotypes. SHB encodes an AP 2 /ERF transcription factor that directly activates transcription of the GA biosynthesis gene KS 1. Thus, root meristem size in rice is modulated by SHB-mediated GA biosynthesis that regulates the elongation and proliferation <b>of</b> <b>meristem</b> cells in a developmental stage-specific manner...|$|R
