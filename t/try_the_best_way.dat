In this context, the term pinpoint analysis refers to identifying and locating software usability deficiencies and correlating these deficiencies with the UI software code. For example, often, when users {{are in a state}} of confusion and not sure how to proceed using the software, they tend to gaze around <b>the</b> screen <b>trying</b> to find <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to complete a task. This behavior is referred to as excessive effort. In this paper, the underlying theory of effort-based usability evaluation along with pattern recognition techniques are used to produce an innovative framework for the objective of identifying usability deficiencies in software.

Heritage is the reverse of this process, and it uses the material elements (e. g. buildings, pictures) and forms of transmission (e. g. profession, works, painting, playing music) to find ideas or values. This perspective changes the image of heritage to portray it only as management of historic preservation. Heritage management in this approach needs to shift focus from the material to the intangible – to the spiritual and social dimensions...|$|R

The bottles were filled upside down, and pressure of the gas in the bottle forced the marble against the washer, sealing in the carbonation. The bottle was pinched into a special shape to provide a chamber into which the marble was pushed to open the bottle. This prevented the marble from blocking the neck as the drink was poured.|$|R
