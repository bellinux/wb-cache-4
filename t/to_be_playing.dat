5|$|Before {{the start}} of extra time Cardiff made their first {{substitution}} of the match, goalscorer Mason was replaced by Filip Kiss. Liverpool had the first chance to score in extra time, but Suárez's header was cleared off the line by Andrew Taylor. Cardiff appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> for a penalty shoot-out, as they were positioning {{the majority of their}} team behind the ball and in front of their goal. Cardiff captain Hudson was replaced in the 98th minute by Anthony Gerrard after suffering from cramp. Liverpool had another chance in the 101st minute, when a pass by Gerrard was cleared for a corner kick by Taylor. The resulting corner was met by Carroll, but his header was wide of the Cardiff goal. Immediately after the attack Carroll was replaced by Dirk Kuyt. Just {{before the end of the}} first half of extra time Liverpool had another chance. Bellamy went past two men down the left hand side of the pitch before exchanging passes with Kuyt, however his subsequent shot went wide.|$|E
5|$|During the 1900 English cricket season, Ollivierre {{travelled}} to England with a West Indian team. Invited to tour England by Lord Hawke {{following the}} success of English tours to the Caribbean, the team was the first from the West Indies to visit England, and matches were not first-class. The team improved steadily throughout, {{and by the end}} of the tour were judged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> well. Although predominantly made up from white players, the team contained several black cricketers; at the time, the dominant teams in the West Indies were exclusively white. Ollivierre was the most consistent and successful batsman in the team, scoring 883 runs at a batting average of 32. His highest score, and only century, came against Leicestershire, when he scored 159 runs and shared an opening partnership of 238 with Pelham Warner. He also shared an opening partnership of 208 with Percy Cox against Surrey. He bowled occasionally in the early part of the tour, although with little success, but did not bowl at all in his last eight games.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff City Football Club, a {{professional}} association football club based in Cardiff, Wales, {{was founded in}} 1899 as Riverside A.F.C. by members of Riverside Cricket Club. The club's first year {{was made up of}} friendlies before they were admitted to the Cardiff & District League in 1900 and later the South Wales Amateur League in 1907. The following year, the club were granted permission to adopt the name Cardiff City, having been denied the previous year as they were deemed not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> at a high enough level, and moved into the English football league system for the first time by joining Division Two of the Southern Football League. They won promotion to Division One in the 1912–13 season and remained there until 1920, playing just three seasons during this time due to the outbreak of the First World War when league football was abandoned. In 1920, they were elected to The Football League, joining the Second Division for one season, winning promotion in their first season after finishing second. The club also competed regularly in the Welsh Cup, winning the trophy 22 times during their history, second only to Wrexham's 23, before they were denied entrance into the competition from 1995 onward by the Football Association of Wales, along with all other clubs playing in the English league pyramid.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Morrissey {{auditioned for}} One Summer, a {{television}} series by Willy Russell for Yorkshire Television and Channel 4 about two Liverpool boys who run away to Wales one summer. Russell had been {{attached to the}} Everyman for many years, and Morrissey had seen {{him while he was}} working behind the bar downstairs from the theatre, though the two had never been introduced. Morrissey went to at least eight auditions, and in one read for the part of Icky opposite Paul McGann, who was reading for Billy. McGann, five years older than Morrissey, believed that he was too old <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> the part of 16-year-old Billy, and stepped back from the production, leaving the role to go to Morrissey. Spencer Leigh got the part of Icky and Ian Hart played the supporting role of Rabbit. Russell had a professional disagreement with the director Gordon Flemyng and producer Keith Richardson over the casting of 18-year-old Morrissey and Leigh; he believed that the sympathy of 16-year-olds running away was lost by casting older actors. Russell subsequently had his name removed from the credits of the original broadcast. After filming One Summer for five months, Morrissey went travelling in Kenya with his cousins. When he returned to Britain, One Summer was being broadcast, and he dealt with the new experience of being recognised in public.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} played on Wednesday 23 May at Worcestershire's New Road ground in Worcester, but no play was possible due to bad weather, and so the match {{was moved to the}} following day. The same thing happened in Watford, where Glamorgan and the Minor Counties were due <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing.</b> Although it was overcast and slightly wet the next morning, play started on time. Rose won the toss for Somerset, and chose to bat first. The Somerset captain himself opened the batting, alongside Peter Denning. Worcestershire's West Indian bowler, Vanburn Holder, bowled the first over. Holder bowled seven deliveries—six denoted a normal over, but he had to bowl one extra due to a no ball—all to Rose, who did not play any scoring shots, and declared Somerset's innings complete {{at the end of the}} over. Somerset had scored just one run, which they were awarded for the no ball, and Worcestershire only needed to score two to win. The players left the field for the ten-minute break between innings, and when they returned Glenn Turner and Alan Ormrod were the batsmen. Colin Dredge bowled the first over for Somerset, and Turner scored one run from it. Keith Jennings bowled the second over, and Turner scored another single from the fourth delivery to grant Worcestershire the victory.|$|E
