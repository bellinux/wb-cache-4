25|$|After Cyclops disbands the X-Men, Cannonball goes home. Paige picks {{him up at}} the airport, {{extremely}} {{happy to}} have him back with the family - she tells him he's lucky they're not all there to mob him. Sam is moody and withdrawn, and as they drive, he asks Paige to stop at a local bar. As soon as he walks in, the local men begin <b>to</b> <b>glare</b> at him, and the bartender asks him not to start anything. Paige knows that Sam came to the bar for a fight, as it's filled {{with members of the}} Cabot family. Soon the Cabots confront Sam, and he pushes them to attack him, which they happily do. Paige refuses to participate, and Sam defeats all four men alone. She demands to know what's wrong with him, and he angrily blasts off into the sky, saying he should have never come home.|$|E

40|$|Colposcopy is a {{diagnostic}} method {{used to detect}} cancer precursors and cancer of the uterine cervix. Computer-Aided-Diagnosis (CAD) for colposcopy is a new field in medical image processing. Colposcopists analyze glare (glint or specular reflection) patterns on the cervix to assess the surface contour (3 D topology) of lesions, an important feature used to evaluate lesion severity. However, glare in the imagery presents major problems for automated image analysis systems. Glare eliminates all information in affected pixels and can introduce artifacts in feature extraction algorithms, such as acetowhite region detection. Although cross-polarization filters can be used <b>to</b> eliminate <b>glare,</b> {{the reality is that}} we have <b>to</b> deal with <b>glare</b> when we want to use existing cervical image databases or use an instrument that does not provide cross-polarized imagery. Here, we present the details and preliminary results of a glare removal algorithm for RGB color images of the cervix that {{can be used as a}} pre-processing step in CAD systems. The algorithm can be extended to multispectral and hyperspectral imagery. The basic approach of the algorithm is to extract a feature image from the RGB image that provides a good <b>glare</b> <b>to</b> background ratio, <b>to</b> detect the <b>glare</b> regions in the feature image, <b>to</b> extend the <b>glare</b> regions <b>to</b> cover all pixels that have been affected by the <b>glare,</b> and <b>to</b> remove the <b>glare</b> in the affected regions by filling in an estimate of the underlying image features. In our current implementation we use the green (G) image component as the feature image, given its high <b>glare</b> <b>to</b> background ratio and simplicity of calculation. Glar...|$|R
