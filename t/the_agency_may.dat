MIGA will cover investments such as equity, loans, shareholder loans, and shareholder loan guarantees. <b>The</b> <b>agency</b> <b>may</b> also insure investments such as management contracts, asset securitization, bonds, leasing activities, franchise agreements, and license agreements. The agency generally offers insurance coverage lasting up to 15 {{years with a}} possible five-year extension depending on a given project's nature and circumstances. When an event occurs that is protected by the insurance, MIGA can exercise the investor's rights against the host country through subrogation to recover expenses associated with covering the claim. However, the agency's convention does not require member governments to treat foreign investments in any special way. As a multilateral institution, MIGA is also {{in a position to}} attempt to sort out potential disputes before they ever turn into insurance claims.|$|E

The agency predicts that the first 18 refueling aircraft would be delivered about seven months late, by March 2018. This is based on [...] "past performance, current risks", such as delays in production, its assessment of new joint Air Force-Boeing schedule review, and the uncertainties with flight testing. <b>The</b> <b>agency</b> <b>may</b> revise its schedule estimate by June 2016.

2500|$|In 1999, the Second Circuit {{considered}} Lewis v.

The appellant was dismissed after refusing to prepare changes to the lottery he had privately expressed reservations about. Without any actual speech to apply the Pickering–Connick tests to, Judge John Walker held that behavior fell under Waters since it adversely affected the lottery's operations.

2500|$|In 1934 Congress {{passed and}} President Roosevelt signed the Copeland [...] "Anti-kickback" [...] Act, a {{supplement}} to the DBA. This was followed in 1935 with another amendment which introduced five changes: (1) The threshold for falling under the DBA requirements were lowered from $5,000 to $2,000; (2) coverage was extended to all federal contract construction, including painting and decorating; (3) <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>may</b> withhold funds sufficient to pay underpaid workers; (4) the Comptroller General would {{make a list of}} contractors who had “disregarded their obligations to employees and subcontractors” so that they could be blacklisted from federal contracts for three years; (5) right of legal action was explicitly granted to laborers regardless of whether they had accepted wages; and (6) DBA contracts would include “the minimum wages to be paid various classes of laborers and mechanics” prior to the submission of bids by a contractor (predetermination). The predetermination requirement set up a mechanism to collect and disseminate appropriate prevailing wage data prior to issuing proposal requests for federal contract bids. Many of these changes were introduced at the urging of labor unions.|$|E
2500|$|Common law {{tests were}} often {{important}} for determining who was, {{not just an}} employee, but the relevant employers who had [...] "vicarious liability". Potentially there can be multiple, joint-employers could who share responsibility, although responsibility in tort law can exist regardless of an employment relationship. In Ruiz v Shell Oil Co, the Fifth Circuit held that it was relevant which employer had more control, whose work was being performed, whether there were agreements in place, who provided tools, {{had a right to}} discharge the employee, or had the obligation to pay. In Local 217, Hotel & Restaurant Employees Union v MHM Inc the question arose under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 whether a subsidiary or parent corporation was responsible to notify employees that the hotel would close. The Second Circuit held the subsidiary was the employer, although the trial court had found the parent responsible while noting the subsidiary would be the employer under the NLRA. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 USC §203(r), any [...] "enterprise" [...] that is under common control will count as the employing entity. Other statutes do not explicitly adopt this approach, although the NLRB has found an enterprise to be an employer if it has [...] "substantially identical management, business purpose, operation, equipment, customers and supervision." [...] In South Prairie Construction Co v Local No 627, the Supreme Court found that the DC Circuit had legitimately identified two corporations as a single employer given that they had a [...] "very substantial qualitative degree of centralized control of labor", but that further determination of the relevant bargaining unit should have been remitted to the NLRB. When employees are hired through an agency, {{it is likely that the}} end-employer will be considered responsible for statutory rights in most cases, although <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>may</b> be regarded as a joint employer.|$|E
