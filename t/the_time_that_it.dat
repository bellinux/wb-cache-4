5|$|Long War is {{a partial}} {{conversion}} mod for XCOM: Enemy Unknown and XCOM: Enemy Within. It was first uploaded to NexusMods on 4 January 2013, and exited beta {{with the release}} of version 1.0 on 28 December 2015. The developers announced in July 2015 with beta 15f2 that they had finished adding new features, and that any future releases would only correct bugs or balance issues. At <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> exited beta, the mod's development was led by four core members, JohnnyLump (John J. Lumpkin), Amineri (Rachel Norman), XMarksTheSpot, and Ellatan (Alex Rozenfeld). They were joined by four senior contributors, 20 voice actors, and 29 contributors assisting with programming, art, sound engineering, translations, research, and porting the mod to Mac and Linux. Three members of Firaxis Games also provided assistance. The team released separate versions for Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within until the end of 2013, and thereafter only released versions for Enemy Within. Long War has been downloaded from NexusMods over 900,000 times by over 333,000 separate users.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhibition}} of exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage by HMB {{is affected by}} <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is used relative to exercise. The greatest reduction in skeletal muscle damage from a single bout of exercise appears to occur when calcium HMB is ingested 1–2hours prior to exercise.|$|E
50|$|The total {{concentration}} of codeine {{in the waters}} of Fishing Creek near Bloomsburg has been measured several times. It was under 0.04 micrograms per liter all <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was measured.|$|R

25|$|Richard Chenevix Trench (1807–1886) {{played the}} {{key role in}} the project's first months, but his Church of England {{appointment}} as Dean of Westminster meant that he could not give the dictionary project <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> required. He withdrew and Herbert Coleridge became the first editor.|$|E
25|$|The {{predecessor}} {{system to}} the Placidus, which largely replaced the Porphyry. The difference with Placidus is that <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> takes the ascendant to reach the meridian is divided equally into three parts. The Alchabitius house system was very popular in Europe before {{the introduction of the}} Regiomontanus system.|$|E
25|$|What {{remained}} of the fort was dismantled in 1915. It {{was seen as a}} crumbling eyesore next to the Alberta Legislature Building, which had been completed three years earlier. The Government of Alberta indicated at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would use the old fort's timbers to create a heritage site elsewhere in the city, but it never did.|$|E

25|$|The {{car park}} was {{designed}} in 1962 by the Owen Luder Partnership when Brutalism {{was regarded as}} {{the cutting edge of}} architecture, but by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> opened in 1967, interest in the movement had begun to decline. The building's raw concrete weathered poorly, and by the time Get Carter was filmed in 1970 the car park had already become patchy.|$|E
25|$|The {{program was}} so {{successful}} at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> spawned a merchandise franchise. Mego released two models of Laverne and Shirley dolls, and one model of Lenny and Squiggy dolls. Hot Wheels created a Shotz Brewery delivery van, and several novelty toys were sold such as Halloween costumes, a board game, jigsaw puzzles, coloring books, video slot machine and other toys.|$|E
25|$|Some {{of the key}} metrics to be {{measured}} in a disaster recovery environment are the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO). RTO is a metric that measures <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> takes for a system to be completely up and running {{in the event of}} a disaster. RPO measures the ability to recover files by specifying a point in time restore of the backup copy.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the dye {{molecule}} has lost an electron and the molecule will decompose if another electron is not provided. The dye strips one from iodide in electrolyte below the TiO2, oxidizing it into triiodide. This reaction occurs quite quickly compared to <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> takes for the injected electron to recombine with the oxidized {{dye molecule}}, preventing this recombination reaction that would effectively short-circuit the solar cell.|$|E
25|$|Westerberg and Tommy Stinson {{went out}} looking for a drummer in 1990, decided on Foley, who was willing, {{and asked him to}} drive them all to an audition. They skipped the audition, which became their first {{practice}} together when their just-released album All Shook Down happened to be in his car's CD player—loudly when Foley turned on the ignition. The band as well as observers knew at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was self-destructing.|$|E
25|$|In a final {{desperate attempt}} to {{overcome}} his drug addiction, partially prompted by his inability to obtain drugs through his usual channels (the authorities had imposed a strict monitoring of the medical institutions {{in order to prevent}} illicit drug distribution during the 1980 Olympics), he relapsed into alcohol and went on a prolonged drinking binge (apparently consuming copious amounts of champagne due to a prevalent misconception at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was better than vodka at countering the effects of drug withdrawal).|$|E
50|$|John Mitchell, Nixon's Attorney General, almost {{immediately}} issued a telegram to <b>the</b> <b>Times</b> ordering <b>that</b> <b>it</b> halt publication. <b>The</b> <b>Times</b> refused, and <b>the</b> government brought suit against it.|$|R

50|$|Intentia began {{implementing}} its internationalization {{plans at}} <b>the</b> same <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> started planning significant development projects. In order to finance these projects, Intentia stock was introduced on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1996.|$|R
25|$|For {{the next}} three years, she slowed down in making movies {{releasing}} only a handful including her final team-up with Dolphy, My Bugoy Goes to Congress, which was a hit during <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was released. Other movies she made were I Love You Mama, I Love You Papa, in which she co-starred with her estranged husband, Christopher de Leon and their children, Lotlot and Ian Kristoffer; Sana Mahalin Mo Ako; Tatlong Ina, Isang Anak; and Balut...Penoy.|$|E
25|$|The SAS Group {{announced}} the airline plans on 10 December 2002, {{at the time}} giving it the temporary name Scandinavian Light. The company stated that they would create a low-cost airline which would focus on the leisure holiday market with focus on Mediterranean destinations. SAS hoped that the new airline would target a different market than Scandinavian Airlines and that the latter would instead focus on the business. A challenge for the company was at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had overcapacity after a recent drop in ridership.|$|E
25|$|In 1902, Kraus {{published}} Sittlichkeit und Kriminalität (Morality and Criminal Justice), for {{the first}} time commenting on what was to become one of his main preoccupations: he attacked the general opinion of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was necessary to defend sexual morality by means of criminal justice (Der Skandal fängt an, wenn die Polizei ihm ein Ende macht, The Scandal Starts When the Police Ends It). Starting in 1906, Kraus published the first of his aphorisms in Die Fackel; they were collected in 1909 in the book Sprüche und Widersprüche (Sayings and Gainsayings).|$|E

50|$|The {{value of}} such a craft at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> was <b>that</b> <b>it</b> did not depend on wind to propel it, and it could operate stealthily in and around harbors and rivers at night.|$|R
50|$|The Cape Government Railways {{acquired}} a single small 0-4-0 side-tank locomotive {{for use as}} construction engine on the Avontuur branch, probably at <b>the</b> same <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> acquired its single 0-6-0T narrow gauge steam locomotive in 1903.|$|R
25|$|Often, most of or all {{infrastructure}} is removed regardless to future use. Laws {{have been passed}} to remove infrastructure, in some case. For example, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, a law was made to remove all unused railroad overpasses. Another example is a natural disaster. If a flood washes away a railbanked railroad bridge, that is beyond the owner's control. The local, state, and Federal governments could give some financial help for the railroad to rebuild any infrastructure {{that may have been}} damaged or destroyed during <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was unused.|$|E
25|$|Outside of New York, {{the privately}} run Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) has a financial-arrangement {{structure}} that is somewhat {{similar to that}} found in New York’s statutory colleges. BCM’s Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) program charges in-state Texas residents a lower tuition rate than that charged to non-Texan residents. This arrangement dates from 1969, and was fostered {{by the state of}} Texas realizing, at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> needed more physicians, coupled with Baylor University's awareness of this need and its trying to help alleviate it.|$|E
25|$|Despite initial {{reports that}} {{technical}} issues {{had resulted in}} the accident, the cause {{was found to be}} spatial disorientation of the pilot following the loss of the attitude indicator. Flying in poor weather conditions, the flight crew would have had to rely only on their instruments; such a situation is known as instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). The failure of the attitude indicator was caused by the failure of both generators and the crew using an outdated checklist and not adhering to a checklist; the battery was therefore drained of power in less than half <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{should have been able to}} supply power for.|$|E
50|$|In 2008 the architects, Brenne Gesellschaft von Architekten, won the World Monuments Fund / Knoll Modernism {{prize for}} the restoration. The prize is now given every two years, {{but this was}} <b>the</b> first <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been awarded.|$|R
50|$|Emerging market focused SPACs, {{particularly}} those seeking to consummate a business combination in China, have been incorporating a 30/36 month timeline {{to account for}} <b>the</b> additional <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has taken previous similar entities to successfully close their business combinations.|$|R
