25|$|In Panjab, {{if a man}} dies on a bed {{his soul}} becomes a Bhoot (ghost), and a woman becomes a Churel. The Kharwars <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the soul leaves the body, it becomes air but if it comes in contact with a person, the soul becomes troublesome. In western India {{especially}} Gujarat, any woman who dies an unnatural death is believed {{to turn into a}} Churel, also known as jakihn, jakhai, mukai, nagulai and alvantin. Originally, it was believed that only a low-caste woman turns to a churel.|$|E

[...] He also explained that experienced reporters often work only with women who feel strong enough to deal with the due diligence required to bring the article to publication.|$|E

Darren {{is due to}} go on a date he has arranged and Nancy comes to watch him, Darren's date does not arrive. As the evening continues, the pair realise there is an attraction between them and agree to go home together. Dawson said that the pair have [...] "always sort of hated each other" [...] as they are opposites, explaining that [...] "She's a feminist and he's a male chauvinist pig!" [...] He felt for the pair to begin {{a relationship}} is a [...] "case of opposites attracting - for some reason it works". Dawson added that through the pair's [...] "pompous ways" [...] they have both been through [...] "hard times and been through them with each other because they've known each other for so long". He commented that the pair have [...] "never seen eye-to-eye, but I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> they sit down and chat they realise they have a lot more in common than they think. In the past they just didn't want to accept that". E4 described the relationship this way: [...] "She's chalk and he's definitely more than a bit cheesy, but there you have it; Darren and Nancy (Dancy) are now officially an item! They’re the original odd-couple!" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{described}} as an anti-war film, as civilians run and only try to save themselves and their family instead of fighting back against the alien Tripods. Debra J. Saunders of San Francisco Chronicle described the film as [...] "If aliens invade, don't fight back. Run." [...] Saunders compared the film to Independence Day, where the civilians do run, but they support the military efforts. Many reviewers considered the film tried to recreate {{the atmosphere of the}} September 11 attacks, with bystanders struggling to survive and the usage of missing-persons displays. Spielberg declared to Reader's Digest that beside the work being a fantasy, the threat represented was real: [...] "They are a wake-up call to face our fears as we confront a force intent on destroying our way of life." [...] Screenwriter David Koepp stated that he tried not to put explicit references to September 11 or the Iraq War, but said that the inspiration for the scene where Robbie joins the Marines was teenagers fighting in the Gaza Strip – [...] "I was thinking of teenagers in Gaza throwing bottles and rocks at tanks, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you're that age you don't fully consider the ramifications of what you're doing and you're very much caught up in the moment and passion, whether that's a good idea or not." [...] Retained from the novel is the aliens being defeated, not by men's weapons, but the planet's smallest creatures, bacteria, which Koepp described as [...] "nature, in a way, knowing a whole lot more than we do".|$|E

He stated that [...] "I do <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> a reader has the possibility to read some chapters, {{he or she can}} always decide to buy the book later." [...] Currently, chapters from The Alchemist can be found on Google Books and Coelho's agency Sant Jordi Associados.|$|E

[...] They demand that Paramount revoke the changes, and when he refuses, they remind him of their power over his life ("If you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> banded in unity").

2500|$|In {{addition}} to their outstanding success on the court, Gottlieb's 2012–13 California team became nationally known as a team that had fun, while also keeping focus. Senior leader Layshia Clarendon cut her hair into what became a trademark mohawk, and the team wrote, produced, and starred in their own music video, [...] "Started from the Bottom." [...] Coach Gottlieb explained: [...] "My philosophy in general is that college athletics should be an enjoyable experience for {{the people involved in}} it. I think you have to embrace this team's nature of being fun-loving. You have to empower them to enjoy the experience. I can do that because I'm so confident in their focus.

2500|$|Some works (e.g. by George Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim) {{have been}} made into both [...] "musical theatre" [...] and [...] "operatic" [...] productions. Similarly, some older operettas or light operas (such as The Pirates of Penzance by Gilbert and Sullivan) have been {{produced}} in modern adaptations that treat them as musicals. For some works, production styles are almost {{as important as the}} work's musical or dramatic content in defining into which art form the piece falls. Sondheim said, [...] "I really <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> something plays Broadway it's a musical, and when it plays in an opera house it's opera. That's it. It's the terrain, the countryside, the expectations of the audience that make it one thing or another." [...] Although this article primarily concerns musical theatre works that are [...] "non-operatic", there remains an overlap in form between lighter operatic forms and more musically complex or ambitious musicals. In practice, {{it is often difficult to}} distinguish among the various kinds of musical theatre, including [...] "musical play", [...] "musical comedy", [...] "operetta" [...] and [...] "light opera".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of [...] (2009), the Hub is {{destroyed}} and Torchwood relocate to London as fugitives. Torchwood itself is later destroyed {{by the end of}} the serial. Fans were left asking the fate of, among other things, the Rift. The [...] of Torchwood relocates primarily to the United States. When asked in an interview with SFX magazine, Davies stated [...] "I like to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> [...] Steven Moffat so thoughtfully closed all those cracks in the universe, the Rift in Cardiff closed up at the same time. I used to wonder what the hell happened to that Rift and now it's all solved. When I watched those cracks seal up I was like, 'Oh, thank you.'" [...] This refers to the events of the 2010 Doctor Who episode [...] "The Big Bang", which was written by Steven Moffat. However, Torchwood media in 2011 since provided a direct explanation for the Rift. In the radio drama [...] "The House of the Dead", Jack visits a haunted location where the Rift allows ghosts, including the deceased Ianto Jones, to enter into the living world. To close the Rift forever and seal an ancient evil on the other side of it, Jack creates a device designed to seal the Rift. The device will also provide Jack an end to his cycle of resurrections. However, Ianto's spirit tricks Jack into leaving, and detonates the device himself, closing the Rift [...] "forever" [...] and with it the barrier between the living and the dead.|$|E
5000|$|Patricia's {{contribution}} Floodland wasn't directly musical. Which {{is not to}} say it wasn't important, {{because the}} look, the feel, the image, if you're in a pop group, is very important. It was an intriguing relationship that had a lot of value - probably more value than Andrew realized at first. And when he did realize it, I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> he became very uneasy with Patricia. But her musical contributions were very minimal.|$|R

2500|$|The band {{returned}} to Rock's Plantation Studios in Hawaii in May 2003 {{to begin the}} first recording sessions for the album. Their intention was to record an album even more simplified than Gravity and even closer in sound to what they sounded like live, an overall different record. [...] "I think we all knew going into it {{that it was an}} important record for us," [...] said Duncan Coutts. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you get more than ten years into a band, It has to be a rebirth for us. We didn't want to go and remake any of our past records." [...] In one month, they recorded 12 songs live off the floor, most in two or three takes each. Following these sessions, several of the songs including [...] "Walking in Circles", [...] "No Warning" [...] and [...] "Wipe That Smile Off your Face" [...] were premiered live. After touring concluded for the year, the band was set to finish the album that October in time for a January 2004 release. While satisfied with the recorded material at first, with time the band became more critical of it and decided they would only be demos. They felt strongly about the songs [...] "Picture", [...] "Will the Future Blame Us?" [...] and [...] "Angels/Losing/Sleep" [...] but felt {{that the rest of the}} songs didn't live up to them. [...] "Even though we loved the energy of what we'd done, not enough of the songs were making the hair stand up on the back of your neck and so we realized that we needed to do more work," [...] bass player Duncan Coutts explained. They decided to postpone the album's release until June and then August to continue recording.|$|E
2500|$|Spears {{talked about}} her {{feelings}} toward the conservatorship her father contains and how she feels about her life, and quotes [...] "There's no excitement, there's no passion... I have really good days, and then I have bad days. Even {{when you go to}} jail, you know there's the time when you're gonna get out. But in this situation, it's never ending. It's just like Groundhog Day every day." [...] Spears added [...] "I think it's too in control, If I wasn't under the restraints I'm under, I'd feel so liberated. When I tell them the way I feel, it's like they hear but they're really not listening. I never wanted to become one of those prisoner people. I always wanted to feel free." [...] The singer also commented on her feelings towards fans and her music style. [...] "It's weird because your music is a reflection of what you're going through," [...] she says. [...] "It's such a part of me, the record, 'cause of what I've gone through." [...] In another clip, Spears talks about how she uses her work as a dancer and singer to deal with the stress of her life and how it helps her deal with her emotions. She said that for her, dancing is like therapy. [...] "If I have a lot of nervous energy, when I start dancing, it all goes away and I just feel emotion. It's like a rollercoaster," [...] she says. [...] "People <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you go through something in life {{you have to go to}} therapy. For me, art is therapy, because it's like you're expressing yourself in such a spiritual way. [...] "Sometimes you don't need to use words to go through what you need to go through," [...] she continues. [...] "Sometimes it's an emotion you need to feel when you dance, that you need to touch. And the only thing that can touch it is when you move a certain way." ...|$|E
