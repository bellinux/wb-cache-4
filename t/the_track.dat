5|$|Cloverleaf {{announced}} Rosecroft {{would close}} on July 1, 2010. Live racing ended in 2009, and <b>the</b> <b>track</b> only had simulcasts as revenue from off-track betting. After {{several of the}} surrounding states legalized casinos, Rosecroft was unable to continue as a successful business. Cloverleaf Enterprises filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2009. Mark Vogel loaned <b>the</b> <b>track</b> $350,000 and offered to buy <b>the</b> <b>track,</b> but a bankruptcy court judge refused to approve the plan. Rosecroft officials had hoped that the Maryland General Assembly would approve legislation allowing casino-style gambling at Rosecroft, {{but that did not}} occur. In early June 2010, Cloverleaf filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>tracking</b> {{convergent}} {{property is}} an important guideline for a reticle seeker. <b>The</b> <b>tracking</b> of <b>the</b> reticle seeker {{is driven by the}} period mean torque which is generated by <b>the</b> <b>tracking</b> signal. In this paper, the convergent property of the reticle seeker was analyzed and some significant conclusions were attained using series theory. The convergence of <b>the</b> <b>tracking</b> procession was affected by both <b>the</b> <b>tracking</b> coefficient and <b>the</b> phase bias Δθ between the target location and <b>the</b> <b>tracking</b> signal. <b>The</b> convergent conditions and the convergent step function were also obtained.
