25|$|While tournament winners Mr. Niebla and Atlantis {{had been}} {{in the middle of a}} storyline rivalry before the match, the tension between the two never built into {{anything}} beyond one singles match between the two. Of all the teams only the storyline between finalists Rush and El Terrible developed into a major storyline. The two faced off on several occasion through most of 2012 until the two met in the main event of the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show where Rush defeated El Terrible, forcing El <b>Terrible</b> <b>to</b> be shaved bald due to the Luchas de Apuestas stipulation.|$|E

Following the match Rush took a microphone and berated both El Terrible and the fans for their actions that night and then followed it up by challenging El <b>Terrible</b> <b>to</b> a Luchas de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match at a later date.

The two sided with Los Independientes (Later renamed Los Invasores) in the storyline between independent wrestlers and CMLL. Both Universo 2000 and Máscara Año 2000 wrestled for CMLL {{for a period of}} time, including a singles match between long time rivals Universo 2000 and Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. for Rayo's WWA World Heavyweight Championship which Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. won. From late 2010 until early 2013 Universo 2000 worked select matches on the independent circuit, but made his return to CMLL in early 2013 during their press conference for the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas ("Homage to two legends") show where he challenged Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. to another match. The match was booked for the Dos Leyendas show with Universo 2000 teaming up with Mr. Niebla and El <b>Terrible</b> <b>to</b> lose to Rayo, Jr. Shocker and Rush.|$|E
25|$|On December 5, 2009, NJPW {{announced}} that Yujiro and Naito were returning to Japan {{as part of}} their annual January 4 Tokyo Dome show called Wrestle Kingdom IV in Tokyo Dome. At the event Yujiro and Naito defeated Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon) and Bad Intentions (Giant Bernard and Karl Anderson) in a three-way hardcore match to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship. No Limit had their first title defense on February 14, 2010, defeating El Texano, Jr. and El <b>Terrible</b> <b>to</b> retain the title. He began using his full name again in February 2010 to signal his progress. On April 4 at New Dimension No Limit joined New Japan's top heel stable CHAOS, led by the IWGP Heavyweight Champion Shinsuke Nakamura. On May 3, 2010, at Wrestling Dontaku 2010 Takahashi and Naito lost the IWGP Tag Team Championship to Yuji Nagata and Wataru Inoue of Seigigun in a three-way match, which also included Bad Intentions (Giant Bernard and Karl Anderson). On October 24 No Limit entered the 2010 G1 Tag League. After three wins and two losses, they finished first in their block and advanced to the semifinals. On November 7, after defeating Manabu Nakanishi and Strong Man in the semifinals, No Limit was defeated in the finals of the tournament by Yuji Nagata and Wataru Inoue. On December 11, 2010, No Limit picked up a major win by defeating the TNA World Tag Team Champions, The Motor City Machine Guns, in a non–title match. On May 3, 2011, No Limit failed in their attempt to regain the IWGP Tag Team Championship from Bad Intentions. After the match Takahashi walked out on Naito. In May 2011 Takahashi took part in New Japan's first tour of the United States, the Invasion Tour 2011. On May 13 in Rahway, New Jersey, he entered the tournament to determine the first ever IWGP Intercontinental Champion, defeating Hideo Saito in his first round match. The following day in New York City, Takahashi was eliminated from the tournament in the semifinal stage by his CHAOS stablemate Toru Yano. Upon their return to Japan, Takahashi turned on Naito on May 26, effectively dissolving No Limit. Takahashi then joined Gedo, Jado and Masato Tanaka as the fourth member of the Chaos sub-group Complete Players. On June 18 at Dominion 6.18, Takahashi defeated Naito in the first match between the former members of No Limit. The two had a rematch on August 1 during {{the first day of the}} 2011 G1 Climax, where Takahashi was once again victorious. Despite his strong start in the tournament, Takahashi only managed to win two more out of his eight remaining matches, finishing second to last in his block, whereas his former partner made it all the way to the finals. On September 19, Naito defeated Takahashi in the third singles match between the two. In the 2011 G1 Tag League, Takahashi teamed with Masato Tanaka with the team picking up three wins in their five group stage matches, including a win over the reigning IWGP Tag Team Champions, Bad Intentions, on October 30. However, a loss to Tetsuya Naito and Tomoaki Honma on October 4, with Naito again pinning Takahashi, meant that Takahashi and Tanaka narrowly missed advancing to the semifinals of the tournament. Takahashi then got involved in Tanaka's IWGP Intercontinental Championship rivalry with MVP, which built to a tag team match on January 4, 2012, at Wrestle Kingdom VI in Tokyo Dome, where Takahashi and Tanaka were defeated by MVP and Shelton Benjamin. On March 11, Takahashi unsuccessfully challenged Hirooki Goto for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship.|$|E

25|$|On February 21, 2013 CMLL held a {{press conference}} to officially {{announce}} that the Homena a Dos Leyendas would pay tribute to Rayo de Jalisco ("The Lighting from Jalisco") and brought out Rayo's son, Rayo de Jalisco Jr., as part of the announcement. Rayo de Jalisco Jr. had not worked for CMLL since 2010 but made a special appearance due to the company honoring his father. During the press conference Rayo de Jalisco Jr.'s long time rival Universo 2000 interrupted Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and the two ended up challenging each other to a match that would take place at the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas, although the exact nature of the match was not announced at the time. The rivalry between the two wrestlers hailed back to at least 1997 where Universo 2000 defeated both Cien Caras and Rayo de Jalisco Jr. to win the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship. Universo 2000 defended the title three times during his reign: against Brazo de Plata, Máscara Sagrada, and Rayo de Jalisco Jr., before losing the championship to Rayo de Jalisco Jr. on September 13, 1998. Universo 2000 regained the title on December 10, 1999 Universo 2000's second reign became a recordbreaking reign in several areas, it was the longest to date as it lasted 1,225 days. He also became the champion with most successful title defenses in one reign including eight defenses against Rayo de Jalisco Jr. during their long running rivalry. After being masked since his debut in 1985 Universo 2000 lost a Lucha de Apuesta match to El Canek in the main event of the 71st Anniversary Show, on September 17, 2004, the match also included Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and Dr. Wagner Jr. and originally came about due to the Universo 2000/Rayo de Jalisco Jr. rivalry. Following his unmasking Universo 2000 won the 2004 Leyenda de Azul (Blue legend tournament). In subsequent years both Universo 2000 and Rayo de Jalisco Jr. left CMLL. In 2005 Rayo de Jalisco Jr. suffered another serious injury, he injured both his knees in a match against Universo 2000's brother Máscara Año 2000, where his legs got caught on the ropes as he jumped out of the ring and he tore ligaments in both knees. The injury kept him out of the ring for almost half a year but in the end Rayo de Jalisco Jr. was able to make a full recovery and return to the ring. The incident was used by several promoters as well as Rayo de Jalisco Jr. himself to create more interest in matches between himself and Universo 2000, Cien Caras and Máscara Año 2000. Rayo de Jalisco Jr. made his return to CMLL in May, 2010, siding with the CMLL loyalists in their feud with Los Invasores, especially Invasore members Universo 2000 and Máscara Año 2000, reiginting the long running storyline between them. But Rayo, Universo and Cien Caras only worked a select few dates for CMLL before leaving again. The official match between the long time rivals saw each team up with participants of the 2013 Torneo Parejas Increibles, only in this case they were on opposite sides instead of teaming up. Rayo de Jalisco Jr. would team up with Shocker and Rush while Universo 2000 would team up with Shocker's rival Mr. Niebla and Rush's rival El Terrible. Shocker and Mr. Niebla had a long backstory between then, having actually worked together as a regular tag team in the late 1990s. In 1998 the two defeated Dr. Wagner Jr. and Emilio Charles Jr. to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship and would subsequently defend the tag team championship against teams such as Blue Panther and Black Warrior, Bestia Salvaje and Scorpio Jr. and the Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras and Universo 2000). In October, 1998 Mr. Niebla suffered an injury during a match, an injury that was so severe that Mr. Niebla was forced to vacate the Tag Team title. Upon his return Mr. Niebla continued to team with Shocker but the team were not able to win the Tag Team title back. On September 24, 1999, at the CMLL 66th Anniversary Show, the team of Nr. Niebla and Shocker faced Atlantis and Villano III in a Relevos suicida match, a match where the losing team would fight each other for their mask. In the main event match of CMLL's 66th Anniversary show, Atlantis and Villano III defeated the much less experienced team, afterwards Mr. Niebla defeated Shocker to unmask him. In the years since Shocker's unmasking the two have wrestled each other on numerous occasions, both in CMLL and other promotions. The two teamed up for the Parejas Increibles tournament and made it to the semi-final but lost to La Sombra and Volador Jr. when the tension between the two became a distraction in the match. The rivalry between Rush and El Terrible started when El Terrible defeated Rush in the finals of a tournament to determine a holder of the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship on January 1, 2012. The two were also paired up for the 2012 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles, and in {{the weeks leading up to}} the tournament Rush stated that he was willing to put his differences with El Terrible aside as he wanted to win the Parejas Increibles tournament, despite the two having developed a heated rivalry over the last number of months. After getting along and qualifying for the final match Rush and El Terrible's miscommunication and dissension allowed their opponents to win the match and the tournament. Following the match Rush took a microphone and berated both El Terrible and the fans for their actions that night and then followed it up by challenging El <b>Terrible</b> <b>to</b> a Luchas de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match at a later date. El Terrible did not accept the challenge at that point in time. The two faced off in the main event of the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show in a Lucha de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match that was won by Rush. The storyline continued to develop in the months following the anniversary event and included El Terrible successfully defending the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship against Rush on January 22, 2013. The two rivals were simply unable to get along from the beginning, causing them to be eliminated in the first round of the Parejas Increibles tournament by Dragón Rojo Jr. and Niebla Roja.|$|E

500|$|While men {{guilty of}} heresy were also {{burned at the}} stake, those who {{committed}} high treason were instead hanged, drawn and quartered. [...] The English jurist William Blackstone supposed that the difference in sentencing, although [...] "full as <b>terrible</b> <b>to</b> the sensation as the other", {{could be explained by}} the desire not to publicly expose a woman's body. [...] Public executions were well-attended affairs, and contemporary reports detail the cries of women on the pyre as they were burned alive. [...] It later became commonplace for the executioner to strangle the convict, and for the body to be burned post-mortem.|$|E
500|$|As {{the most}} egregious offence an {{individual}} could commit, viewed as seriously as though the accused had personally attacked the monarch, high treason demanded the ultimate punishment. [...] But whereas men guilty of this crime were hanged, drawn and quartered, women were drawn and burned. [...] In his Commentaries on the Laws of England the 18th-century English jurist William Blackstone noted that the sentence, [...] "to be drawn to the gallows, and there to be burned alive", was [...] "full as <b>terrible</b> <b>to</b> the sensation as the other". [...] Blackstone wrote that women were burned rather than quartered as [...] "the decency due to the sex forbids the exposing and publicly mangling their bodies". [...] However, an observation by historian Jules Michelet, that [...] "the first flame to rise consumed the clothes, revealing poor trembling nakedness", may, {{in the opinion of}} historian Vic Gatrell, suggest that this solution is [...] "misconceived". [...] In The Hanging Tree, Gatrell concludes that the occasional live burial of women in Europe gave tacit acknowledgement to the possibility that a struggling, kicking female hanging from a noose could [...] "elicit obscene fantasies" [...] from watching males.|$|E

[...] However, he expressed disappointment in {{the end of the second}} season, which he deemed surprisingly less strong, compared to the [...] "powerful" [...] first half and the [...] "immaculate" [...] first season, describing Stevens' [...] "awkward and self-destructive" [...] relationship with a patient as a way to [...] "slow episodes to a screeching halt with maudlin and painfully underdeveloped turns towards melodrama", while expressing the predictability of Duquette's death. Gilchrist stated in response to Stevens' development in the last part of the second season: [...] "Izzie's descent into abject hysteria, which followed her season-long sanctimoniousness about everything, actually made me want something <b>terrible</b> <b>to</b> happen to her too." [...] He described how some episodes were not among the show's strongest, noting that the some plot lines created poignancy, and connected in an unfamiliar way.|$|E

500|$|When Fischer was 16, {{his mother}} {{moved out of}} their {{apartment}} to pursue medical training. Her friend Joan Rodker, who had met Regina when the two were [...] "idealistic communists" [...] living in Moscow in the 1930s, believes that Fischer resented his mother for being mostly absent as a mother, a communist activist and an admirer of the Soviet Union and that this led to his hatred for the Soviet Union. In letters to Rodker, Fischer's mother states her desire to pursue her own [...] "obsession" [...] of training in medicine and writes that her son would {{have to live in}} their Brooklyn apartment without her: [...] "It sounds <b>terrible</b> <b>to</b> leave a 16-year-old to his own devices, but he is probably happier that way". The apartment was on the edge of Bedford-Stuyvesant, a neighborhood that had one of the highest homicide and general crime rates in New York City. Despite the alienation from her son, Regina, in 1960, protested the practices of the American Chess Foundation and staged a five-hour protest in front of the White House, urging President Dwight D. Eisenhower to send an American team to that year's chess Olympiad (set for Leipzig, East Germany, behind the Iron Curtain) and to help support the team financially.|$|E
500|$|On 4 April, Governor O'Friel {{spoke to}} the press for the first time, {{describing}} the riot as [...] "an explosion of evil which was quite <b>terrible</b> <b>to</b> see". Also that day the Prison Officers Association claimed that Rule 43(a) prisoners were being treated in North Manchester General Hospital for castration wounds, which was repeated by sections of the press despite being categorically denied by the hospital's public relations officer and consultant-in-charge. 29 prisoners surrendered during the day leaving 26 prisoners inside the prison, 11 {{of whom had been}} identified by the Prison Service. Also that day a prison officer died in hospital from pneumonia; he had not been injured during the riot and suffered from a long-standing medical condition. Two more prisoners surrendered on 5 April, the same day as the Home Office announced a public inquiry into the riot headed by Lord Woolf. By this time plans to retake the entire prison by force had been scrapped due to the likelihood of fatalities among prisoners or prison officers. That evening the police and prison officers introduced new tactics designed to weaken the resolve of the prisoners and to prevent them from sleeping. Loud music was played, lights were shone at the roof, and prison officers banged on their riot shields and shouted at the prisoners, including calling them [...] "beasts".|$|E
500|$|In late-2006/early-2007 Mephisto and Averno began teaming {{regularly}} with Ephesto (named after the Greek god Hephaestus), who was {{formerly known as}} Safari before. He was given an [...] "underworld" [...] character by CMLL and teamed up with Averno and Mephisto to create a regular trio team. The three came to the ring wearing black, hooded robes and were briefly introduced as Los Ku Klux Klan, but soon after dropped the controversial name to become known as La Triada del Terror ("The Terror Trio"). While the team of Mephisto and Averno had been busy defending the CMLL Tag Team titles Mephisto also found time to defend the CMLL World Welterweight title he had worn for over three years, until he was finally defeated by CMLL’s rising star Místico on April 10, 2007, ending his title reign after days 1,141 days. In 2008 Mephisto and Averno were invited to join Perro Aguayo Jr.'s Perros del Mal ("The Bad Dogs") faction, while Ephesto was not asked to join them. The duo had only {{been a part of}} Los Perros del Mal for a short while before Aguayo Jr. {{and a number of other}} Perros members decided to leave CMLL.

500|$|In fact, Stewart did {{not enjoy}} King's confidence. [...] Though he brought him into his cabinet in 1921 in part {{at the urging of}} Progressive leader Thomas Crerar, King found Stewart to be an {{inadequate}} protector of western interests—especially in his advocacy of tariff reduction, which King found lacklustre—and did not trust his political advice on the west. [...] By 1925 he was considering appointing Stewart to the Senate, to remove him from active political involvement, but was handicapped by the absence of any other Alberta representation in his cabinet. [...] In 1926 Stewart served as an emissary from King to recruit Saskatchewan Premier Charles Avery Dunning to the federal cabinet; the mission fulfilled, King kept Stewart in cabinet but wrote in his diary that all matters pertaining to Alberta were to be [...] "left to Dunning to do as he thinks best". [...] By 1927, King complained that Stewart had [...] "no grip" [...] on the province of which he had once been Premier, and in 1930 he wrote [...] "Organization in Alberta is terrible. [...] Stewart is worse than useless, is like an old woman, with no real control of situation." [...] In the 1930 federal election Dunning and Crerar were both defeated; King complained that it was [...] "perfectly <b>terrible</b> <b>to</b> have Stewart alone representing the West." [...] When Stewart too went down to defeat in 1935, King was pleased [...] "not to have to consider him" [...] in assembling his new cabinet, and opted instead to leave Alberta unrepresented to punish it for failing to elect any Liberals.|$|E
500|$|That evening Graves did a damage assessment. He {{noted that}} [...] "the French {{had not the}} {{appearance}} of near so much damage as we had sustained", and that five of his fleet were either leaking or virtually crippled in their mobility. De Grasse wrote that [...] "we perceived by the sailing of the English that they had suffered greatly." [...] Nonetheless, Graves maintained a windward position through the night, {{so that he would}} have the choice of battle in the morning. Ongoing repairs made it clear to Graves that he would be unable to attack the next day. On the night of 6 September he held council with Hood and Drake. During this meeting Hood and Graves supposedly exchanged words concerning the conflicting signals, and Hood proposed turning the fleet around to make for the Chesapeake. Graves rejected the plan, and the fleets continued to drift eastward, away from Cornwallis. [...] On 8 and 9 September the French fleet at times gained the advantage of the wind, and briefly threatened the British with renewed action. French scouts spied Barras' fleet on 9 September, and de Grasse turned his fleet back toward Chesapeake Bay that night. Arriving on 12 September, he found that Barras had arrived two days earlier. Graves ordered the <b>Terrible</b> <b>to</b> be scuttled on 11 September due to her leaky condition, and was notified on 13 September that the French fleet was back in the Chesapeake; he still did not learn that de Grasse's line had not included the fleet of Barras, because the frigate captain making the report had not counted the ships. [...] In a council held that day, the British admirals decided against attacking the French, due to [...] "the truly lamentable state we have brought ourself." [...] Graves then turned his battered fleet toward New York, arriving off Sandy Hook on 20 September.|$|E
500|$|On January 22, 2010, Volador Jr. {{teamed up}} with El <b>Terrible</b> <b>to</b> {{participate}} in CMLL's [...] "Torneo Nacional de Pareja Increíbles" [...] ("National Amazing Pairs tournament"), a tournament where CMLL teams up a Tecnico (Volador Jr.) and a Rudo (El Terrible) for a tournament. In {{the second round of}} the tournament the team faced Averno and Místico. Initially Místico wrestle as the tecnico he has been for years, but during the match Místico's attitude seemily changed as he began attacking Volador Jr., someone he had teamed with for years. Místico even went so far as to ripping up Volador's mask, a rudo move, and won the match after an illegal low blow to Volador Jr. After the match Místico took the microphone and claimed that [...] "all was fair in war and defending Mexico City", a comment that drew many boos from the crowd. The two met in the main event of an Arena México show on February 5, 2010, and this time Místico was clearly a Rúdo, tearing so viciously at Volador's mask that a new mask had to be brought to the ring during falls. In the second fall Místico pulled his mask off and threw it to Volador Jr. in an attempt to get Volador Jr. disqualified. The end came when Volador Jr. reversed Místico's La Mística and won by applying the same move to Místico. Following the match Místico angrily proclaimed “¡Yo soy la máxima figura de la lucha libre!”. ("I am the greatest figure in wrestling"). On February 12, 2010, Místico lost the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship to Volador Jr. two falls to one. On the February 26 CMLL Super Viernes show it was announced that Místico, Volador Jr., La Sombra and El Felino would face off in a four way Lucha de Apuesta match as the main event of the 2010 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas. La Sombra was the first man pinned at Dos Leyendas and El Felino was the second, forcing the two to put their masks on the line. After a long match La Sombra pinned El Felino. After the match he unmasked and announced that his real name was Jorge Luis Casas Ruiz. Following Dos Leyendas Místico announced that he was done being a rúdo and returned to the técnico side, although Volador Jr. remained suspicious of Místico. The storyline between the two cooled off for a bit, but in late May 2010, tension resumed as Místico and Volador Jr. faced off once again at the Mexican Light Heavyweight Championship, with Volador Jr. retaining the belt. At the 2010 Sin Salida the two were on opposite sides of a Relevos incredibles, Místico teamed with Máscara Dorada and Mr. Águila while Volador Jr. teamed with Averno and Negro Casas. Averno came to the ring wearing the same combined Averno/Místico mask he had worn for the Parejas Incredibles tournament and tried to convince Místico to join the rúdo side, only to turn around and reveal that both he and Volador Jr. were wearing a combined Averno/Volador Jr. mask underneath. Volador Jr. worked as a rúdo throughout the match, losing the match for his team when he tried to cheat but was caught by the referee. On July 12, 2010, at the Promociones Gutiérrez 1st Anniversary Show, Volador Jr. participated in a match where 10 men put their mask on the line in a match that featured five pareja incredibles teams, with the losing team being forced to wrestle each other with their mask on the line. His partner in the match was El Alebrije, facing off against the teams of Atlantis and Olímpico, Místico and El Oriental, Histeria and La Sombra, and Último Guerrero and Averno. Volador Jr. and El Alebrije were the second team to escape the match. In the end Místico defeated El Oriental to unmask him. After teasing a rudo turn for over a month, Volador Jr. and La Sombra lost the CMLL World Tag Team Championship to the Los Invasores team of Mr. Águila and Héctor Garza on July 23, 2010 without any signs of dissension between the two. During a later show Volador Jr. finally turned rudo when he attacked La Sombra, tore his former partner's mask off and beat him up. During the 2010 Universal Championship tournament, Volador Jr. defeated Valiente in the first round. In the second round Volador Jr. faced La Máscara and cemented his status as a rudo when he was disqualified for excessive violence against La Máscara. He kept attacking La Máscara after the match ended, leaving La Máscara an easy victim for his next round opponent, Jushin Thunder Liger.|$|E
