5|$|Bradley was {{unanimously}} {{chosen as}} a delegate-at-large to six consecutive Republican National Conventions. At the 1880 Republican National Convention in Chicago, he was unanimously chosen to second Roscoe Conkling's nomination of Ulysses S. Grant {{for a third}} term as president. His rousing oratory gained him the attention of prominent leaders of his party. At the 1884 convention, he was instrumental in defeating a motion to curtail Southern states' representation. President Chester A. Arthur chose Bradley to help recover financial damages from postal officials involved in the Star Route Frauds in 1885, but Bradley resigned <b>this</b> <b>responsibility</b> over differences with U.S. Attorney General Benjamin H. Brewster regarding the prosecution of these cases.|$|E
5|$|Following Syria's secession, Nasser grew {{concerned}} with Amer's inability {{to train and}} modernize the army, and with the state within a state Amer had created in the military command and intelligence apparatus. In late 1961, Nasser established the Presidential Council and decreed it the authority to approve all senior military appointments, instead of leaving <b>this</b> <b>responsibility</b> solely to Amer. Moreover, he instructed that the primary criterion for promotion should be merit and not personal loyalties. Nasser retracted the initiative after Amer's allies in the officers corps threatened to mobilize against him.|$|E
5|$|Teaching {{members of}} the colleges (i.e. fellows and tutors) are collectively and familiarly known as dons, {{although}} the term is rarely used by the university itself. In addition to residential and dining facilities, the colleges provide social, cultural, and recreational activities for their members. Colleges have responsibility for admitting undergraduates and organising their tuition; for graduates, <b>this</b> <b>responsibility</b> falls upon the departments. There is no common title for the heads of colleges: the titles used include Warden, Provost, Principal, President, Rector, Master and Dean.|$|E

Angerstein's {{paintings}} were joined in 1826 by those from Beaumont's collection, and in 1831 by the Reverend William Holwell Carr's bequest of 35 paintings. Initially the Keeper of Paintings, William Seguier, bore the burden of managing the Gallery, but in July 1824 some of <b>this</b> <b>responsibility</b> fell to the newly formed board of trustees.|$|E
5|$|The {{central office}} in Washington, which {{evolved into the}} National Meteorological Center and Weather Prediction Center (formally known as the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center), assumed {{hurricane}} warning/advisory responsibility at that time. <b>This</b> <b>responsibility</b> passed to regional hurricane offices in 1935, {{and the concept of}} the Atlantic hurricane season was established to keep a vigilant lookout for tropical cyclones during certain times of the year.

5|$|Although operationally {{placed at}} the {{disposal}} of the British, the AIF was administered as a separate national force, with the Australian government reserving the responsibility for the promotion, pay, clothing, equipment and feeding of its personnel. The AIF was administered separately from the home-based army in Australia, and a parallel system was set up to deal with non-operational matters including record-keeping, finance, ordnance, personnel, quartermaster and other issues. The AIF also had separate conditions of service, rules regarding promotion and seniority, and graduation list for officers. <b>This</b> <b>responsibility</b> initially fell to Bridges, in addition to his duties as its commander; however, an Administrative Headquarters was later set up in Cairo in Egypt. Following the redeployment of the Australian infantry divisions to the Western Front it was relocated to London. Additional responsibilities included liaison with the British War Office as well as the Australian Department of Defence in Melbourne, whilst also being tasked with the command of all Australian troops in Britain. A training headquarters was also established at Salisbury.|$|E

5|$|As at Northampton, Chapman's tactics {{were based}} upon the {{principles}} of a strong defence and a fast, counter-attacking response, with the focus on quick, short passing and mazy runs from his wingers, who would pass low inside the defence instead of crossing from the byline. He had been granted control of all footballing affairs at the club and made <b>this</b> <b>responsibility</b> work to his advantage, encouraging the club's reserve and third teams to play the same style of football so that their players would function effectively in the first team if selected. He employed a wide-ranging scouting network {{to find the right}} players for his tactical system. Bolstered by the money from the cup run, Chapman was able to make further signings such as goalkeeper Ted Taylor and forward Charlie Wilson (later to be joined by George Cook).|$|E
5|$|If {{most of the}} Sea Harriers {{had been}} lost, the GR.3s would have {{replaced}} them in air patrol duties, even though the Harrier GR.3 was not designed for air defence operations; as such the GR.3s quickly had their outboard weapons pylons modified to take air-to-air Sidewinder missiles. From 10 to 24 May 1982, prior to British forces landing in the Falklands, a detachment of three GR.3s provided air defence for Ascension Island until three F-4 Phantom IIs arrived to take on <b>this</b> <b>responsibility.</b> During the Falklands War, the greatest threats to the Harriers were deemed to be surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and small arms fire from the ground. In total, four Harrier GR.3s and six Sea Harriers were lost to ground fire, accidents, or mechanical failure. More than 2,000 Harrier sorties were conducted during the conflict—equivalent to six sorties per day per aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In August 2006, {{the newly}} reorganized unit {{deployed}} to Iraq {{in support of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom VI. On 26 September 2006, it uncased its colors at Tallil Airbase in Iraq, to provide support services for coalition forces and Iraqi security forces in southern Iraq. They took <b>this</b> <b>responsibility</b> from the 16th Sustainment Brigade, which was rotating out of the theater. Throughout the deployment and into 2007, the brigade's medical staff was rotated into hospitals in Baghdad, Iraq for thirty day tours for each unit. The medical staff, including many of the brigade's field medics, treated American forces injured in fighting around Baghdad. In August 2007, the brigade participated in a large coalition athletic competition hosted by the US Air Force's 407th Air Expeditionary Group at Ali Air Base, Iraq.

5|$|Joseph G. Wilson {{started in}} 1853 as the clerk {{for the court}} and was {{responsible}} for the Oregon Reports until 1870, though he also served as a justice on the court from 1862 to 1870. Later federal judge Charles B. Bellinger then took over editing the reports, and served as clerk until 1880. He was followed by T. B. Odeneal, J. A. Stratton, and W. H. Holmes, until 1889 when a law was passed that included a provision that the Chief Justice take over <b>this</b> <b>responsibility.</b> This arrangement only lasted a few years, as in 1891 a new law allowed the court to hire an official reporter, with later Chief Justice George H. Burnett serving as the first official reporter.|$|E
5|$|Limbert and Roworth have commented that, {{unlike other}} peat areas, {{such as the}} Somerset Levels, where {{recording}} of the industrial heritage has been systematic, the recording of the industrial archaeology of Thorne and Hatfield Moors has been notably scarce. A guide to the industrial history of South Yorkshire published in 1995 {{made no mention of}} peat at all. The canals dug by the Dutch and operated until the 1920s have been mentioned by canal historians such as Charles Hadfield, but have never been investigated systematically. The railways have received a little more attention in the specialist press, and some of the locomotives have been preserved. The history of the workers has been partially recorded through the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Oral History Project. In contrast, the ecology of the moors has been better documented, through the publication of the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Papers, first published by the Doncaster Naturalists Society in 1987. Since 1989, the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Conservation Forum have taken over <b>this</b> <b>responsibility.</b> These papers now run to eight volumes, and the forum has also published technical papers on many aspects of the moors.|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{influenced}} the {{decision made by}} the Australian Government in October 1942 to recall the 9th Division to Australia. Most importantly, the Government and {{the commander of the}} Australian Military Forces, General Thomas Blamey, wanted to relieve the 6th and 7th Divisions from combat in the New Guinea Campaign and Blamey considered the 9th Division to be better prepared for <b>this</b> <b>responsibility</b> than the Australian Army's militia forces or US Army units. The commander of Allied forces in the South West Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur, had also been pressing the US and Australian Governments for reinforcements to conduct offensive operations against Japanese positions. Other factors influencing the Australian Government's decision were a desire to concentrate the Australian Army in a single theatre, the increasing difficulty in finding replacements for the 9th Division's casualties given the Army's manpower shortages, the political difficulties associated with implementing reforms to permit militia units to serve outside Australian territory, and concerns that a prolonged absence from Australia would affect morale among the 9th Division's soldiers.|$|E

5|$|The Minister Steward (Shaofu 少府), {{also known}} as the Privy Treasurer and Small Treasurer, served the emperor exclusively, {{providing}} him with entertainment and amusements, proper food and clothing, medicine and physical care, valuables and equipment. For this purpose he was given responsibility for the emperor's personal finances during Western Han, yet <b>this</b> <b>responsibility</b> was transferred to the Minister of Finance during Eastern Han. Although he was not a castrated eunuch, many of his subordinates were, since his ministry managed the imperial harem housing concubines. His secretaries were headed by a Prefect of the Masters of Writing (Shangshu ling 尚書令). The secretaries were responsible for relaying all written messages to the emperor, official correspondence with Excellencies, senior ministers, provincial authorities, common people who submitted memorials to the throne, and non-Han-Chinese peoples within and outside the empire. Since the Masters of Writing were not eunuchs, and thus not allowed into the imperial harem, Emperor Wu established an all-eunuch office of secretaries for the inner palace, which was abolished in 29 BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{drawing up}} {{of a regular}} season {{schedule}} had been a perennial source of contention among the NFL owners since the league's inception. The crux {{of the problem was}} the scheduling of games meant weighing the interest of owners who, early in the season, wanted their franchises to confront teams that drew the largest crowds, versus owners who wanted to play the weaker franchises to pad their team's win-loss record. The resultant impasse coerced the owners, in 1946, to confer upon Bell the sole discretion in developing the league's schedule. He utilized <b>this</b> <b>responsibility</b> to, early in the season, pit the weaker teams against other weak teams, and the strong teams against other strong teams. His goal was to augment game attendances by keeping the difference in team standings to a minimum as deep into the season as possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{became the}} first Australian fighter unit to be equipped with Dassault Mirage III fighters in December 1964 and was declared operational with these aircraft on 1August 1967. It subsequently maintained a detachment of Mirages at Darwin from 2May 1966 until early 1967. Following a period of training No.75 Squadron transferred to RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaysia during May 1967. From this base the squadron took part in regular exercises with the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF), Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF), Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) and occasional exercises involving the RAF. No.75 Squadron also trained with the United States Air Force and United States Navy on occasion, including the large-scale Cope Thunder series of exercises during which it deployed to Clark Air Base in the Philippines. Throughout its period based at Butterworth No.75 Squadron deployed detachments of six Mirages to Tengah Air Base in Singapore on a rotational basis with No. 3 Squadron RAAF, with <b>this</b> <b>responsibility</b> swapping between the two units every three months.|$|E

5|$|The English {{common law}} {{position}} that a public body cannot fetter its discretion by abdicating its responsibility and powers to another was discussed and adopted in Lines International. The general rules that Justice Prakash enunciated {{in the case}} are that, first, a public body has the duty to exercise discretion by itself; it cannot abdicate <b>this</b> <b>responsibility</b> by taking orders from other bodies unless it is under a legal duty to do so. Therefore, a condition in its policy {{that appeared to be}} a direction by the PSA to itself to take orders from either the Gambling Suppression Branch ("GSB") of the Singapore Police Force or STPB to deny berths to cruise vessels was a fetter on PSA's exercise of discretion and was held to be invalid. However, the invalid condition alone did not mean that the PSA had in fact fettered its discretion. The High Court stated that while the PSA had agreed to take orders from the GSB and STPB {{on the basis of the}} invalid condition, whether it had in fact done so was another matter. On the evidence, the Court went on to find that the PSA had in fact made its own decision in the matter.|$|E
5|$|Browning was {{shortly after}} {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} Major General, and he then supervised the newlyformed division as it underwent a prolonged of expansion and intensive training, with new brigades being raised and then assigned to the division and even more new equipment being tested. By midApril 1942 the division was able to conduct a smallscale airborne exercise {{for the benefit of the}} Prime Minister, in which twentyone transport aircraft and nine gliders participated, and by late December the division had been brought up to full strength. In midSeptember, as the division was coming close to reaching full strength, Browning was informed that Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, would take place in November. After being informed that the 2nd Battalion of the American 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment was to take part in the campaign, he argued that a larger airborne force should be utilised during the invasion, as the large distances and comparatively light opposition would provide a number of opportunities for airborne operations. The War Office and CommanderinChief, Home Forces were won over by the argument, and agreed to detach 1st Parachute Brigade from 1st Airborne Division and place it under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would command all Allied troops participating in the invasion. The Air Ministry was unable to provide transport aircraft or aircrews to operate with the brigade, so the United States Army Air Forces took over <b>this</b> <b>responsibility,</b> providing 60 Group of 51 Wing which flew Douglas C-47 Dakotas. A practice drop was conducted with a unit from the brigade on 9 October, although a lack of American familiarity with British airborne equipment and parachuting technique, as well a lack of British familiarity with the Dakota, led to three men being killed; this meant a delay in training whilst new techniques were developed, which in turn resulted in the majority of the brigade's personnel travelling to North Africa without having conducted a training drop from a Dakota. After it had been brought to full operational strength, partly by crossposting personnel from the newlyformed 2nd Parachute Brigade, and had been provided with sufficient equipment and resources, the brigade departed for North Africa at the beginning of November.|$|E
