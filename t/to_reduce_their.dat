5|$|Birds are a {{significant}} hazard to aircraft, {{but it is difficult}} to keep them away from airfields. Several methods have been explored. Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, and it may be possible <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> numbers on airfields by reducing the number of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas.|$|E

However, after the lineages diverged and became genetically isolated, the skin of both groups lightened more, and that additional lightening was due to different genetic changes.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the Japanese {{consortium}} of Kawasaki Heavy Industries with Nippon Sharyo, Tokyu Car Corp and Kinki Sharyo was awarded Contract 151 {{at a cost}} of S$581.5 million for the construction of 396 passenger cars. Kawasaki won the contract; its bid—aided by favourable financing from Mitsui and positive economic conditions in Japan—was 12% lower than those of other bidders. The award was the largest single contract awarded in the initial construction of the system. Kawasaki also promised to supply $20.9m worth of complimentary spare parts after delivery. The loss of Contract 151 was a massive financial blow to Metro-Cammell, who were forced <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> workforce by half later that year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of normal immune response, parts of {{pathogens}} (e.g. bacteria) are recognized by the immune system as foreign (non-self), and eliminated or effectively neutralized <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> potential damage. Such a recognizable substance is called an antigen. The immune system may respond in multiple ways to an antigen; a key feature of this response is the production of antibodies by B cells (or B lymphocytes) involving {{an arm of the}} immune system known as humoral immunity. The antibodies are soluble and do not require direct cell-to-cell contact between the pathogen and the B-cell to function.|$|E

5|$|The California condor has a {{long life}} span, {{reaching}} up to 60 years. If it survives to adulthood, the condor has few natural threats other than humans. Because they lack a syrinx, their vocal display is limited to grunts and hisses. Condors bathe frequently and can spend hours a day preening their feathers. Condors also perform urohidrosis, or defecate on their legs, <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> body temperature. There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a pecking order decided by body language, competitive play behavior, {{and a variety of}} hisses and grunts. This social hierarchy is displayed especially when the birds feed, with the dominant birds eating before the younger ones.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this summary of findings identifies the financial and non-financial barriers that prevent lower income households from <b>reducing</b> <b>their</b> carbon consumption. This research is designed as a follow-up to the data mining exercise (CRC-LCL RP 3001) conducted by Burke and Ralston. In their report, Burke and Ralston (2015) identified rising fuel costs as {{a major factor in}} lower income household’s adoption of adaptive behavours <b>to</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>their</b> carbon consumption. They found that “low income households, for whatever reason, found it harder to adapt their energy budget to either rising costs or consumption needs” (Burke & Ralston 2015 : 5). This was despite energy costs having risen relative to income between 1993 and 2012, and that industry liberalisation had not created new levels of fuel hardship. The barriers that prevent lower income households <b>to</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>their</b> carbon consumption may, therefore, be more than financial and these households may be constrained by other factors. For example, social and private renters (as identified in Burke and Ralston (2015) as two groups particularly vulnerable to increases in fuel costs) may be constrained from modifying their homes (e. g. installing insulation) to make them more energy efficient...|$|R
