5|$|Sponges {{have three}} asexual methods of reproduction: after fragmentation; by budding; and by {{producing}} gemmules. Fragments of sponges may be detached by currents or waves. They use {{the mobility of}} their pinacocytes and choanocytes and reshaping of the mesohyl to re-attach themselves to a suitable surface and then rebuild themselves as small but functional sponges {{over the course of}} several days. The same capabilities enable sponges that have been squeezed <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> cloth to regenerate. A sponge fragment can only regenerate if it contains both collencytes to produce mesohyl and archeocytes to produce all the other cell types. A very few species reproduce by budding.|$|E
5|$|Diarist John Evelyn {{lived in}} Deptford at Sayes Court from 1652. Evelyn {{inherited}} {{the house when}} he married the daughter of Sir Richard Browne in 1652. On his return to England at the Restoration, Evelyn laid out meticulously planned gardens in the French style, of hedges and parterres. In its grounds was a cottage at one time rented by master woodcarver Grinling Gibbons. After Evelyn had moved to Surrey in 1694, Russian Tsar Peter the Great studied shipbuilding for three months in 1698. He {{and some of his}} fellow Russians stayed at Sayes Court, the manor house of Deptford. Evelyn was angered at the antics of the Tsar, who got drunk with his friends and, using a wheelbarrow with Peter in it, rammed their way <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> holly hedge. Sayes Court was demolished in 1728-9 and a workhouse built on its site. Part of the estates around Sayes Court were purchased in 1742 for the building of the Navy Victualling Yard, which was renamed the Royal Victoria Victualing Yard in 1858 after a visit by Queen Victoria. This massive facility included warehouses, a bakery, a cattleyard/abattoir and sugar stores, and closed in 1961. All that remains is the name of Sayes Court Park, accessed from Sayes Court Street off Evelyn Street, not far from Deptford High Street. The Pepys Estate, opened on 13 July 1966, is on the former grounds of the Victualing Yard.|$|E

A fish consommé {{is a type of}} clear soup made from richly flavored fish stock that has been clarified usually <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>fining</b> process involving egg protein. Fish consommés usually have too little natural gelatin, so the fish stock may be double-cooked or supplemented. Since fish gelatin melts at a lower temperature than gelatins of other meats, fish aspic is more delicate and melts more readily in the mouth. Dehydrated stock can be formed into small cubes (pictured at right) called stock cubes.|$|R

Immediately before extrusion, the mass is passed through a vacuum chamber to remove any trapped air. It is then extruded into a long log or blank, cut to convenient lengths, passed through a metal detector, and then stamped into shape in refrigerated tools. The pressed bars are packaged in many ways.|$|E
40|$|The {{boundary}} layer problem for power-law fluid can be recast to a third-order p-Laplacian {{boundary value problem}} (BVP). In this paper, we transform the third-order p-Laplacian into a new system which exhibits a Lie-symmetry SL(3,ℝ). Then, the closure property of the Lie-group is used to derive a linear transformation between the boundary values at two ends of a spatial interval. Hence, we can iteratively solve the missing left boundary conditions, which are determined by matching the right boundary conditions <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>finer</b> tuning of r∈[0, 1]. The present SL(3,ℝ) Lie-group shooting method is easily implemented and is efficient to tackle the multiple solutions of the third-order p-Laplacian. When the missing left boundary values can be determined accurately, we can apply the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK 4) method to obtain a quite accurate numerical solution of the p-Laplacian...|$|R

25|$|The priory had its demesne - its own {{site and}} small {{areas in the}} manor of Brewood. These latter were {{exchanged}} in the 13th century for a small, enclosed area close to the priory. Similarly, the nuns exchanged the Pattingham lands for an assart at Chillington, paying Ralph Bassett's widow, Isabel de Pattingham, £1 for the transaction. At {{some time in the}} late 12th century they acquired lands at Rudge, Shropshire. In 1204, William de Rudge charged them 4 marks and an annual rent of three pence to consolidate and extend their holding, exchanging land he had given them earlier. He also handed over lands previously held by one of his tenants for a payment of a palfrey and four marks, and an annual rent of 12 pence. In every case, the nuns seem to be consolidating scattered and unremunerative holdings to try to obtain a better and more secure income. A profitable asset was a mill at Chetton, given by the lady of the manor, Sybil de Broc, in 1225. In 1272 the nuns received lands at Broomhill, just east of the priory, from the heirs of Ralph de Coven, as well as a rent in Brewood and another worth 16d. at Horsebrook.

40|$|Corrosion {{performance}} of sand cast magnesium alloy MEZ was investigated for unrefined (MEZU) and Zr-grain-refined (MEZR) microstructures in 5 % NaCl solution using salt spray, immersion, in situ {{examination of the}} corrosion morphology, ESEM, electron probe microanalysis, hydrogen evolution and polarisation curves. MEZU demonstrated higher rates of anodic dissolution and cathodic hydrogen evolution than MEZR. The central zirconium-rich areas within the grains of the MEZR microstructure was more corrosion resistant than the outer zirconium-depleted areas of the grains, whereas MEZU showed little difference in corrosion between the centre and {{the edge of the}} grains. Based on the analyses of the corrosion process, polarisation behaviour and the microstructure of these two alloys, it is postulated that zirconium acts {{in a number of ways}} to improve corrosion resistance. Zirconium stabilises the solid solution and makes it inactive in anodic dissolution, significantly passivates the precipitated particles reducing cathodic hydrogen evolution and increases the barrier effect of the grain boundary phase <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>finer</b> grain size and thus a more continuous layer of the grain boundary phase...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacteria}} in butter are largely {{contained in the}} moisture droplets. Since water is not the continuous phase, as in milk and cream, migration does not take place readily, and growth is restricted primarily to infected droplets. As pointed out by various investigators, the working of butter disperses the moisture into finer droplets. In under worked butter the droplets are relatively large while in thoroughly worked butter they are smaller and well separated by fat. The number of {{bacteria in}} a portion of butter remains practically constant during working, consequently {{an increase in the}} number of water droplets <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>finer</b> dispersion of the moisture results in a decrease in the percentage of infected droplets. Decreasing the size of the droplets also decreases the nutrients available to the bacteria in the infected droplets. Accordingly, the distribution of moisture in butter is a factor tending to influence the growth of bacteria, and changes due to bacterial action should take place more slowly in thoroughly worked than in under worked butter...|$|R

40|$|Storage Area Networks (SANs) are {{networks}} that provide storage and related services to servers. SAN’s often serve very diverse environments {{with respect to}} the operating systems of the attached servers. This diversity increases the complexity of SAN management, and often mandates that specialized software tools be used to ensure optimal SAN performance. All SAN management solutions currently on the market require some type of agent software running on the servers attached to the SAN to discover various types of information. Thus the deployment of the discovery agent is a critical part of the success of any SAN management software solution. This paper describes a software tool that we developed for remote deployment of SAN discovery agents in multiple operating system environments. The tool supports selective and parallel agent deployment, update, and removal of the agent.
