5|$|Due to {{the strain}} on the oxygen supplies, the crew decides to abandon most of the {{equipment}} and to cut short the lunar stay. The repair work is completed slightly ahead of schedule, and the rocket cleared for lift-off. Halfway to Earth, Jorgen escapes his bonds thanks to the detectives' bungling and tries to kill Tintin and the others; Wolff seeks to prevent him, and in their struggle over a gun Jorgen is killed. When it is revealed that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be enough oxygen aboard for the crew to survive the journey, Wolff sacrifices himself by opening the airlock and floating out into space to his death. The crew fall unconscious but Tintin wakes long enough to set the rocket to auto-pilot and it arrives back in Syldavia safely.|$|E

5|$|The {{physical}} {{impacts of}} ashfall {{can affect the}} operation of water treatment plants. Ash can block intake structures, cause severe abrasion damage to pump impellers and overload pump motors. Many water treatment plants have an initial coagulation/flocculation step that is automatically adjusted to turbidity (the level of suspended solids, measured in nephelometric turbidity units) in the incoming water. In most cases, changes in turbidity caused by suspended ash particles will be within the normal operating range of the plant and can be managed satisfactorily by adjusting the addition of coagulant. Ashfalls {{will be more likely}} to cause problems for plants that are not designed for high levels of turbidity and which may omit coagulation/flocculation treatment. Ash can enter filtration systems such as open sand filters both by direct fallout and via intake waters. In most cases, increased maintenance will be required to manage the effects of an ashfall, but <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be service interruptions.|$|E

25|$|This eclipse was {{the most}} central total eclipse in 800 years, with a gamma of -.0041. <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be a more central eclipse for another 800 years. Its {{magnitude}} was also greater than any eclipse since the 6th century.|$|E
25|$|Totality began {{over the}} Pacific Ocean and Hawaii moving across Mexico, down through Central America and across South America ending over Brazil.

25|$|A beta patch for PC was {{released}} on 21 September 2009. A second beta (beta version 2) for the PC {{was released}} on 28 September 2009.

25|$|Decisions {{are based}} on the advice of the Amir-ul Momineen. For us {{consultation}} is not necessary. We believe that this is in line with the Sharia. We abide by the Amir's view even if he alone takes this view. <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be a head of state. Instead there will be an Amir al-Mu'minin. Mullah Omar will be the highest authority and the government {{will not be able to}} implement any decision to which he does not agree. General elections are incompatible with Sharia and therefore we reject them.|$|E

25|$|Angles, {{times of}} day, and other {{cyclical}} quantities require modular arithmetic to add and otherwise combine numbers. In all these situations, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be a unique mean. For example, the times {{an hour before}} and after midnight are equidistant to both midnight and noon. It {{is also possible that}} no mean exists. Consider a color wheel -- there is no mean to the set of all colors. In these situations, you must decide which mean is most useful. You can do this by adjusting the values before averaging, or by using a specialized approach for the mean of circular quantities.|$|E
25|$|Haiman {{describes}} iconic {{expression and}} conceptual distance and how two concepts are conceptually close if they share semantic properties, affect {{each other and}} cannot be separated from one another. Joseph Greenberg hypothesizes that {{the distance between the}} possessor and possessee in a sentence with alienable possession will be greater than it will be in sentences inalienable constructions. Because the possessor and the possessee have a close conceptual relationship, their relative positions with a sentence reflect this and <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be a lot of distance between them. Increasing the distance between the two would in turn increase their conceptual independence.|$|E
25|$|Another {{less obvious}} error can also occur when heating the dies. After being {{taken out of}} the {{annealing}} furnace, the dies must cool for 24 to 36 hours. They are usually given an oil bath to cool them more quickly, but the dies must still cool for a period of several hours. When the dies are cooling, if they are not stored properly or not allowed to fully cool before being used, the result is a much softer die. When the die is subjected to the hubbing press again and work hardened again, it will be softer and more susceptible to wear. If the die is softer because it was not fully cooled, it will not harden to the same standard as a die which has received proper treatment. However, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be a noticeable difference between a good die and a bad die; the change {{in the structure of the}} die does is not apparent until it is used for a period of time.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} discipline, effort and {{attention}} needed from both divers in a buddy pair, and the even greater input required in a three diver team, is unattractive to a confident diver who has {{other things to}} do during a straightforward, low risk, recreational dive, and the system is undermined when any one of the divers fails to put in the effort, putting the burden on the remaining diver who takes the responsibilities more seriously. Familiarity with the environment, and the very low incidence of life-threatening accidents is likely to lead to a confidence that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be a problem on any given dive, so the divers may pay less attention to good buddy practices, and this may become habitual. This may be exacerbated by the divers being strangers thrown together by chance and the whims of the divemaster, who have no real interest in each other, and whose reasons to dive may be incompatible. Pairing an explorer with a macro photographer will annoy at least one, probably both, if they comply with recommended buddy diving practices. Many nominally buddy dives effectively become solo dives soon after entering the water, with the buddies occasionally checking for the presence of each other and often being beyond direct view of each other. In spite of this, very few of these divers die as a consequence.|$|E

But {{while all}} his pants {{are in the}} dryer, SpongeBob gets distracted by Patrick who wants SpongeBob to hear him make funny sounds with his tongue for a long time. Eventually, SpongeBob goes to check on his pants which all shrunk in the dryer; he heads to the mall to buy new pairs.

500|$|According to Jaswant Singh, [...] "With Jinnah's death Pakistan {{lost its}} moorings.

[...] Malik writes, [...] "As long as Jinnah was alive, he could persuade and even {{pressure}} regional leaders toward greater mutual accommodation, but after his death, {{the lack of}} consensus {{on the distribution of}} political power and economic resources often turned controversial." [...] According to Mohiuddin, [...] "Jinnah's death deprived Pakistan of a leader who could have enhanced stability and democratic governance... The rocky road to democracy in Pakistan and the relatively smooth one in India can in some measure be ascribed to Pakistan's tragedy of losing an incorruptible and highly revered leader so soon after independence." ...|$|E
