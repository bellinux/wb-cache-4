40|$|Abrasive {{blasting}} {{is a large}} {{field and}} a process that has long existed in mechanical manufacturing. The unpredictable nature of the process makes its research in most cases not theoretically calculated. Instead experiments are used to verify various parameters in the design. In this work, no detailed experiments could be performed due. to time and resource constraints. Trainparts Sweden AB in Bollnäs reconditions and manufactures leaf springs for rail vehicles, {{and they want to}} investigate the introduction of abrasive blasting in their production line. The aim is to investigate what kind of abrasive blasting equipment that fit the company's production line. The goal is to develop a concept proposal on a abrasive <b>blasting</b> <b>machine</b> for own manufacturing or facilitating an investment of a market existing machine.   To come up with a concept proposal a simple working model were developed and was followed during the work on the thesis. Market research on existing abrasive <b>blasting</b> <b>machines</b> and literature studies in the affected areas was conducted {{as the basis for the}} work. Thereafter a comparison with respect to cost, efficiency and application of the different parameters in the abrasive blasting process was made.   The result of this work is a wheel <b>blasting</b> <b>machine</b> with four wheels; this is what gives the best results for the products.   Our conclusion is that a wheel <b>blasting</b> <b>machine</b> is the best option from a manufacturing standpoint but because of high purchase price and low production volumes, it may be appropriate to look at other approaches...|$|R
50|$|In wheel blasting, a {{spinning}} wheel propels the abrasive against an object. It is typically categorized as an airless blasting operation {{because there is}} no propellant (gas or liquid) used. A wheel machine is a high-power, high-efficiency blasting operation with recyclable abrasive (typically steel or stainless steel shot, cut wire, grit, or similarly sized pellets). Specialized wheel <b>blast</b> <b>machines</b> propel plastic abrasive in a cryogenic chamber, and is usually used for deflashing plastic and rubber components. The size of the wheel <b>blast</b> <b>machine,</b> and the number and power of the wheels vary considerably depending on the parts to be blasted {{as well as on the}} expected result and efficiency. The first blast wheel was patented by Wheelabrator in 1932.|$|R

50|$|Dry-ice {{blasting}} {{technology can}} trace its roots to conventional abrasive blasting. The differences between an abrasive-blasting machine and a dry-ice <b>blasting</b> <b>machine</b> are {{in how they}} handle the blast media. Unlike sand or other media, dry ice is generally used at its sublimation temperature. This means that a pressurized hopper system could potentially build up dangerous amounts of pressure (see dry ice bomb). Other differences include systems for preventing the ice from forming snowball-like jams, and different materials to allow operation at very low temperatures.|$|R

When the biologist is ready to use the actual rocket net, the net is folded accordion style in a line or packed in the rocket net bock. The rear or trailing edge of the net is staked to the ground by ropes and {{the leading edge of the}} net is attached to a number of rockets (typically 3 or 4) via longer ropes. The rockets are placed on the box, staked to the ground, or placed on post for additional elevation when taller animals are trapped. The charges are placed in the rocket and the wires attached to a shunted electrical blasting line. Once all the charges are connected, the line is tested, and the area is safe, it is attached to the capacitor <b>blasting</b> <b>machine.</b> When the animals are in place, the operator activates the <b>blasting</b> <b>machine</b> and the electrical charge ignites the rockets, propelling the net over the animals. The biologists and their team then remove the animals for whatever study they are conducting.|$|R

40|$|Using a {{modified}} air <b>blasting</b> <b>machine</b> warm peening at 20 O C < T I 410 "C was feasible. An optimized peening temperature of about 310 "C was identified for a 450 "C quenched and tern-pered steel AISI 4140. Warm peening was also investigated for a normalized, a 650 "C quen-ched and tempered, and a martensitically hardened material state. The quasi static surface compressive yield strengths {{as well as}} the cyclic surface yield strengths were determined from residual stress relaxation tests conducted at different stress amplitudes and numbers of loading cycles. Dynamic and static strain aging effects acting during and after warm peening clearly increased the residual stress stability and the alternating bending strength for all material states. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} explore the cutting rules and {{optimize}} the cutting parameters of titanium alloy, multiple sets of test parameters were schemed out by using the uniform design method. Test cutting researches with these parameters were conducted under the condition of 12 ℃ dry cutting and- 50 ℃ cold <b>blast</b> <b>machining</b> respectively. Through the regression analysis about {{the results of the}} test, a multiple linear regression model which is applicable for titanium alloy cutting on its surface roughness and cutting force has been established. The variance analysis shows that it is of remarkable linear relationship. On this basis, a multi-objective optimization model of titanium alloy has been set up.

Verification tests were done under these cutting parameters, and the results are in good agreement with the calculated...|$|R

40|$|The LTC 1073 Vacuum <b>Blasting</b> <b>Machine</b> uses a high capacity, direct {{pressure}} {{blasting system}} incorporating a continuous feed for the blast media. The blast media cleans the surface within the contained brush {{area of the}} blast head. A vacuum system removes dust and debris from the surfaces as it is blasted. After cleaning the surface, the abrasive, together with the rust or coating that {{was removed from the}} surface, is vacuumed into the machine through the suction hose. The dust separator contains angled steel collision pads, working with the force of gravity, to allow any reusable abrasive to fall back into the pressure vessel. The filters are manually back flushed to prevent clogging. After back flushing, dust is dumped from the dust chamber into the dust collection bag or drum by operation of the bellows valve. The safety and health evaluation during the testing demonstration focused on dust and noise exposure. Dust exposure was found to be minimal, but noise exposure was potentially significant. Further testing for each of these exposures is recommended because the outdoor environment where the testing demonstration took place may cause the results to be inapplicable to indoor settings. It is feasible that the dust and noise levels will be higher in an enclosed operating environment. Other safety and health issues found were ergonomics, heat stress, tripping hazards, lockout/tagout, and arm-hand vibration...|$|R

40|$|Shot <b>blasting</b> <b>machines</b> {{are widely}} used for {{automated}} surface treatment and finishing of castings. In shot blasting processes the stream of shots is generated and shaped by blasting turbines, making up a kinetic and dynamic system comprising a separating rotor, an adapting sleeve and a propelling rotor provided with blades. The shot blasting performance- i. e. the quality of shot treated surfaces depends on the actual design and operational parameters of the unit whilst the values of relevant parameters {{are associated with the}} geometry of turbine components and the level of its integration with the separator system. The circulation of the blasting medium becomes the integrating factor of the process line, starting from the hopper, through the propeller turbine, casting treatment, separation of contaminated abrasive mixture, to its recycling and reuse. Inferior quality of the abrasive agent (shot) and insufficient purity of the abrasive mixture are responsible for low effectiveness of shot blasting. However, most practitioners fail to fully recognise the importance of proper diagnostics of the shot blasting process in industrial conditions. The wearing of major machine components and of the blasting agent and quality of shot treated surfaces are often misinterpreted, hence the need to take into account all factors involved in the process within the frame of a comprehensive methodology. This paper is an attempt to formulate and apply the available testing methods to the engineering practice in industrial conditions...|$|R
