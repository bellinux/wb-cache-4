5|$|At Chelsea, Fàbregas {{played a}} similar playmaking role in midfield, using his technique, ball control, vision, and passing ability to dictate <b>the</b> <b>tempo</b> of his team's play, {{while he was}} {{supported}} by defensive midfielders, {{in order to give}} him more space and time on the ball. In this deeper creative role, he excelled in Chelsea's new style of play under Mourinho, where he proved to be an effective assist-provider.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{playing as}} a {{deep-lying}} midfielder, Carrick does {{not rely on}} pace, physical attributes and tackling like a typical ball-winning midfielder. Instead, his reading of the game helps him anticipate any attacking threats from the opposition team, {{most of the time}} by covering space and making interceptions. His distribution of the ball, creativity, and range of passing, which are among the best in comparison to other midfielders in Europe, add to his importance in dictating <b>the</b> <b>tempo</b> of the game, as well as initiating team attacks.|$|E
5|$|The work {{begins with}} a sinfonia and then {{alternates}} choral movements and arias. There are no recitatives, no da capo repeats, {{and there is no}} chorale tune, unusually for Bach's cantatas. Bach makes extensive use of choral fugues and imitative polyphony, often shifting <b>the</b> <b>tempo</b> and character of the music within movements very quickly to accommodate a new musical idea with each successive phrase of text.|$|E

5|$|Capcom began {{development}} knowing {{they wanted to}} make a survival horror game with a lead female character. Believing that the female lead would not bode well with retailers and players alike, they added in a dog partner that could attack enemies. After this change, they further designed the gameplay around this partner mechanic. The cinematics were directed by actor and director, Naoto Takenaka. He directly supervised the motion capture performances used for all the characters, placing emphasis on dramatic performance. Takenaka played the motion capture role for Riccardo, and Japanese actors Yasue Sato and Jiro Sato played Fiona and Debilitas respectively. Rather than streaming audio files, the music for Haunting Ground was generated by using the PS2's built-in sounds. This way, the composers could easily change <b>the</b> <b>tempo</b> of the music during gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Fellow {{players on}} the Italian {{national}} team nicknamed Pirlo l'architetto ("the Architect"), {{because of the way}} in which he buildt plays, and set up goal-scoring opportunities with long, lobbed through passes. In later seasons, Juventus fans also dubbed him il professore ("the professor"), Maestro, and Mozart, as a reference to the Austrian composer's prodigious ability. Pirlo was also frequently compared to fellow former Milan and Italy playmaker Demetrio Albertini early in his Milan career, due to their similar characteristics and style of play. Pirlo was often thought to be Albertini's heir for Milan and the national side; he inherited his nickname the metronome whilst playing at Milan, for the way in which he influenced games by controlling <b>the</b> <b>tempo</b> of his team's play through his direct and efficient passing game in midfield, as well as his ability to make himself available to teammates to receive and distribute the ball.|$|E
5|$|Hill {{joined the}} Rock the Bells hip-hop festival {{series in the}} U.S. during August 2010, {{and as part of}} that year's theme of {{rendering}} classic albums, she performed The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill in its entirety for the first time. She increased <b>the</b> <b>tempo</b> and urgency from the original recording, but at times had difficulty in communicating with her band. Hill continued touring, including a set at the 6th Annual Jazz in the Gardens, in Miami Gardens, Florida in December. In Spring 2011, Hill performed at the Coachella Valley Music Festival, New Orleans Jazz Fest, and at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. In July 2011, Hill gave birth to her sixth child, Micah, her first not with Rohan Marley; the father remains publicly unknown.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> march <b>tempo</b> of 120 beats or steps {{per minute}} was adapted by Napoleon Bonaparte [...] {{so that his}} army could move faster. Since he planned to occupy the {{territory}} he conquered, instead of his soldiers carrying all of their provisions with them, they would live off the land and march faster. <b>The</b> French march <b>tempo</b> is faster than <b>the</b> traditional <b>tempo</b> of British marches; the British call marches in <b>the</b> French <b>tempo</b> quick marches. Traditional American marches use the French or quick march tempo. There are two reason for this: First, U.S. military bands adopted the march tempos of France and other continental European nations that aided the U.S. during its early wars with Great Britain. Second, the composer of the greatest American marches, John Philip Sousa, was of Portuguese and German descent. Portugal used <b>the</b> French <b>tempo</b> exclusively—the standard Sousa learned during his musical education. A military band playing or marching at the traditional British march tempo would seem unusually slow in the United States.|$|R

5|$|In Italy, Archduke John went {{up against}} Napoleon's stepson Eugène. The Austrians beat back several bungled French assaults at the Battle of Sacile in April, causing Eugène {{to fall back}} on Verona and the Adige River, but Eugène regrouped and {{launched}} a more mature offensive that expelled the Austrians from Northern Italy again. By the time of Wagram, Eugène's forces had joined Napoleon's main army. In Dalmatia, Marmont, under the nominal command of Eugène, was fighting against General Stoichewich. Marmont launched a mountain offensive on 30 April, but this was repulsed by the Grenzer troops. Like Eugène, however, Marmont did not let an initial setback dictate <b>the</b> <b>tempo</b> of the conflict. He went back on the offensive and joined Napoleon at Wagram.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Cole handed NWA over to Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth. At {{this stage}} of the war, the Allies were {{advancing}} north and <b>the</b> <b>tempo</b> of operations in the Darwin area had decreased. Charlesworth raised concerns regarding No.80 Wing, warning higher command that its morale would drop if it was not either given {{a more active role in}} the war or transferred to southern Australia for rest. By October, the wing had received orders to depart NWA for Morotai to join the First Tactical Air Force; this left NWA with twelve squadrons at its disposal, including one Liberator unit and three other Spitfire squadrons. In the meantime, NWA supported the assault on Leyte with attacks on enemy ports, oil facilities, and shipping in the Dutch East Indies using Beaufighters, Mitchells, and Liberators. These operations continued through November and December. By then, NWA headquarters staff numbered 651, including 156 officers.|$|E
5|$|Luton faced Oxford United in the semi-final {{which was}} played over two-legs. The first leg was at Oxford's home ground Manor Ground, where Luton had beaten their opponents 5–2 {{earlier in the}} league season. On a wet, muddy surface, both clubs {{struggled}} to control <b>the</b> <b>tempo,</b> though Luton played the more incisive football and looked threatening in their opponent's half. Harford's 19th goal of the season gave Luton the breakthrough in the tie, but Oxford equalised from the penalty spot. The home side were awarded a second penalty when Dean Saunders was brought down in Luton's area, but Sealey saved his attempt. Having received consent from the police to stage the second leg at Kenilworth Road, a near-capacity crowd saw Luton win 2–0.|$|E

5|$|Reger's Hebbel Requiem {{is in one}} movement. It {{follows the}} overall form of the narrated poem, but with variations, {{resulting}} in a structure of different moods.

The translation of the incipits is given as in the liner notes of the 2009 recording in the translation by Richard Stokes. The four-part SATB chorus is often divided. The work is in D minor and common time. <b>The</b> <b>tempo</b> marking is Molto sostenuto, and is sustained with only slight modifications (stringendo and ritardando) until the most dramatic section, marked Più mosso (faster) and later Allegro, returning to the initial tempo for the conclusion.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Amiens {{was a major}} {{turning point}} in <b>the</b> <b>tempo</b> of the war. The Germans had started the war with the Schlieffen Plan before the Race to the Sea slowed {{movement}} on the Western Front and the war devolved into trench warfare. The German Spring Offensive earlier that year had once again given Germany the offensive edge on the Western Front. Armoured support helped the Allies tear a hole through trench lines, weakening once impregnable trench positions. The British Third Army with no armoured support had almost {{no effect on the}} line while the Fourth, with fewer than a thousand tanks, broke deep into German territory. Australian commander John Monash was knighted by King George V in the days following the battle.|$|E
5|$|Agungs {{also play}} a major role in agung orchestras—ensembles {{composed}} of large hanging, suspended or held, knobbed gongs which act as drones without any accompanying melodic instrument like a kulintang. Such orchestras are prevalent among Indigenous Philippine groups (Bagobo, Bilaan, Bukidon, Hanunoo, Magsaka, Manabo, Mangyan, Palawan, Subanun, Suludnon, T’boli, Tagakaolu, Tagbanwa and the Tiruray), regions in Kalimantan and Indonesia (Iban, Modang, Murut) and Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysia (Bidayuh, Iban, Kadazan-Dusun, Kajan, Kayan), places where agung orchestras take precedence over kulintang-like orchestras. The composition and tuning of these orchestras vary widely from one group to another. For instance, the Hanunoo of Mindoro have a small agung ensemble consisting of only two light gongs played by two musicians on the floor in a simple duple rhythm while the Manobo have an ensemble (called an ahong) consisting of 10 small agungs hung vertically on a triangular frame. It includes three musicians: one standing up, playing the melody, and the rest sitting. The ahong is divided by purpose, with the higher-pitched gongs (kaantuhan) carrying the melody, three to four lower-pitched gongs (gandingan) playing melodic ostinato figures, and the lowest-pitched gong (bandil) setting <b>the</b> <b>tempo.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although Collins {{used it as}} a {{catharsis}} for her {{opposition to}} the Vietnam War, two years after her rendition, the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, senior Scottish regiment of the British Army, recorded an instrumental version featuring a bagpipe soloist accompanied by a pipe and drum band. <b>The</b> <b>tempo</b> of their arrangement was slowed to allow for the bagpipes, but it was based on Collins': it began with a bagpipe solo introduction similar to her lone voice, then it was accompanied by the band of bagpipes and horns, whereas in her version she is backed up by a chorus. It topped the RPM national singles chart in Canada for three weeks, and rose as high as number 11 in the U.S. It is also a controversial instrumental, as it combined pipes with a military band. The Pipe Major of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards was summoned to Edinburgh Castle and chastised for demeaning the bagpipes. Funeral processions for killed police, fire, and military personnel have often played a bagpipes version ever since.|$|E
5|$|Between the wars, Krueger {{served in}} a number of command and staff positions, and {{attended}} the Naval War College at his own request. In 1941, he assumed command of the Third Army, which he led in the Louisiana Maneuvers. He expected, in view of his age, to spend the war at home training troops, but in 1943 he was sent to General Douglas MacArthur's Southwest Pacific Area as commander of the Sixth Army and Alamo Force, which he led in a series of victorious campaigns against the Japanese. As an army commander, Krueger had to grapple with the problems imposed by vast distances, inhospitable terrain, unfavorable climate, and an indefatigable and dangerous enemy. He had to balance MacArthur's need to speed up <b>the</b> <b>tempo</b> of operations in order to win campaigns with the more cautious approach of subordinates who often found themselves confronted by unexpectedly large numbers of Japanese troops. In the Battle of Luzon in 1945, his largest, longest and last battle, he was finally able to maneuver his army as he had in 1941 against a Japanese army under Tomoyuki Yamashita.|$|E
5|$|Coastal Command {{had begun}} {{scouting}} for German shipping near the Dutch coast in spring 1940. Squadrons were working {{up on the}} Blenheim IV fighters at the time. However their preparation was short-lived. The German assault on Western Europe on 10 May 1940 changed <b>the</b> <b>tempo</b> of events. On 11 May, No. 235 Squadron RAF was used to cover the landing of small British Army units near The Hague. Shortly after its capture, No. 22 Squadron RAF dropped ten 500lb bombs on Waalhaven airport, Rotterdam. No. 206 Squadron conducted armed reconnaissance along the Dutch coast and after permission was received, No. 220 and 233 Squadrons bombed oil storage tanks at Hamburg and Bremen on 18 May. Five Beauforts made similar attacks on Rotterdam on 29 May, which caused extensive fires. The same day, No. 22 Squadron made the first daylight anti-shipping attack on E-boats in IJmuiden harbour. No. 40 and No. 500 Squadron conducted {{the same kind of}} strikes.|$|E
