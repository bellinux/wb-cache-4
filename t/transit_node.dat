50|$|SPBM offers {{both the}} ideal {{multicast}} replication model, where packets are replicated only at fork {{points in the}} shortest path tree that connects members, and also the less state intensive head end replication model where in essence serial unicast packets are sent to all other members along the same shortest path first tree. These two models are selected by specifying properties of the service at the edge which affect the <b>transit</b> <b>node</b> decisions on multicast state installation. This allows for a trade-off to be made between optimum transit replication points (with their larger state costs) v.s. reduced core state (but much more traffic) of the head end replication model. These selections can be different for different {{members of the same}} Individual Service ID (I-SID) allowing different trade-offs to be made for different members.|$|E

40|$|When {{you drive}} to somewhere ‘far away’, you will leave your current {{location}} via {{one of only}} a few ‘important ’ traffic junctions. Recently, other research groups and we have largely independently developed this informal observation into <b>transit</b> <b>node</b> routing, a technique for reducing quickest-path queries in road networks to a small number of table lookups. The contribution of our paper is twofold. First, we present a generic framework for <b>transit</b> <b>node</b> routing that allows almost constant time routing for both global and local queries. Second, we develop a highly tuned implementation using highway hierarchies. For the road maps of Western Europe and the United States, our best query times improve over the best previously published figures by two orders of magnitude. This is more than one million times faster than the best known algorithm for general networks. We also explain how to compute complete descriptions of shortest paths (and not only their lengths) very efficiently...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the planning issues relating to parking and access around <b>transit</b> <b>nodes.</b> It reviews Perth 2 ̆ 7 s current strategy of providing park-and-ride facilities and promoting transit oriented developments. The paper is based on review of planning documents, site visits and interviews with planners from the local council and Public Transit Authority in Perth. Using a case study of suburban railway station in Murdoch, the paper identifies a number of planning challenges such as congestion in park-and-ride facilities, spill-over parking in surrounding neighbourhoods, poor access by walking and cycling, and public safety concerns. The paper discusses ways to improve the situation by prioritising access to <b>transit</b> <b>nodes</b> through various means of transport (walking, cycling, buses) rather than just focussing on provision of more car parking spaces. Other measures include discouraging free park-and-ride facilities, provision of reliable, frequent feeder bus services and preparation of an integrated local transport plan for the area around <b>transit</b> <b>nodes...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} obtain a modal shift from car towards public {{transport}}, {{the quality of a}} public transport journey has to be increased. The transfer is the least valued part of the journey where a traveller perceives one minute of waiting as three minutes. By improving the least valued part, the overall quality of a public transport journey increases. There are three strategies to add value to the transfer at a transit node: accelerate, condense and enhance. In order to determine where these strategies need to be applied, the node-place model is used. The node-place model assesses the quality of transit nodes by focusing on the node and place characteristics of a <b>transit</b> <b>node.</b> The potential of transit nodes can be indicated by classifying them in twelve <b>transit</b> <b>node</b> typologies. However, the node-place model only indicates where it is needed to accelerate and condense. Therefore, in this thesis the node-place model is extended with the experience value in order to provide insight into where enhancement is needed. By doing a literature review, the criteria for the experience value were determined. An MCDM, the Best-Worst Method (BWM) was used to derive the weights for the criteria. The input for BWM was obtained by conducting a survey among 160 respondents. Finally, the node-place model and the <b>transit</b> <b>node</b> typologies were extended with the experience value in order to assess the quality and indicate the potential. A case study in Rotterdam was used to apply and illustrate the method. The method was evaluated by comparing results from the new method with the node-place model and it was concluded that the new method shows more accurate results.

Finally, we show that a specialization to the online many-to-one (or one-to-many) shortest path further speeds up query time by {{an order of magnitude}}. This variant even has better query time than the fastest known previous methods which need much more space. Comment: 19 pages, submitted to SEA' 201...|$|E
40|$|Reactive {{congestion}} control based upon two thresholds is analyzed. Under the {{congestion control}} treated here, a multiplexer or <b>transit</b> <b>node</b> in the networkrecognizes congestion when its queue length reaches some pre-determined threshold value, denoted by H. The congested node then explicitly informs the sources sharing the node of its congestion {{in some way}} to marka forward congestion notification bit in the header of cells if provided, or to directly send control cells to those sources. The sources then stop the cell transmission according to the feedbackinformation received. The relief of congestion is recognized by the node when its queue length decreases to some low-threshold, L, and informs the sources that the sources can again start the cell transmission. In this paper, we investigate this sort of congestion control by forming a queueing network, in which multiple sources and a single node are explicitly modeled. Through an analysis, we discuss the impact of those two thresholds to performance of the congestion control...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{planning}} {{and construction of}} urban transit often {{pay more attention to}} the needs of urban traffic, and less to the needs of urban public space, which lead to the contradiction between rail transit and urban public space. The paper develops a theoretical framework for the integrated design of rail transit and public space, based on the analysis of contradictions and problems between them. First, an integrated planning method is put forward in a macro level through analyzing the interaction between rail transit network and public space system. Second, the influence factors are identified by analyzing the relationship between urban <b>transit</b> <b>nodes</b> and public spaces in all types and levels. Thus the integrated solution and pattern of rail <b>transit</b> <b>nodes</b> and public space are developed in a micro level.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} a {{substantial}} amount of research in finding routing algorithms designed specifically to run on real-world graphs.

In this paper, we show corresponding lower bounds for the same three algorithms. We also show how to improve a result by Milosavljevic which lower bounds the number of shortcuts added in the preprocessing stage for contraction hierarchies. We relax the assumption of an optimal contraction order (which is NP-hard to compute), allowing the result to be applicable to real-world instances. Finally, we give a proof that optimal preprocessing for hub labeling is NP-hard. Hardness of optimal preprocessing is known for most routing algorithms, and was suspected to be true for hub labeling...|$|E
30|$|Cronin et al.[6] {{proposed}} the <b>transit</b> <b>node</b> heuristic for mirror placement on the Internet, where mirrors {{are placed on}} candidate hosts in descending order of out-degree. The heuristic {{was based on the}} assumption that nodes with the highest out-degrees can reach more nodes with lower latencies. Following the same incentive for the SNA Inspired - Greedy Virtual Surrogate Placement Heuristic (SNA-GVSP), the out-degree metric has been replaced by the SPBC metric. Specifically, the goal of SNA-GVSP is to greedily assign end users to surrogate servers, maximizing the average SPBC of the selected set of surrogates. Each end user is assigned to at least one surrogate server within its cluster, so that the QoS distance constraint is satisfied, while ensuring that the capacity of the physical resources is not exceeded. The detailed description of the server placement algorithm is provided in[2]. Subsequently, to identify the content delivery paths from the origin to surrogates servers, a shortest path algorithm is applied, as the one in the content distribution path selection phase of the SNA-VSP, taking into consideration capacity constraints of the underlying physical network.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We present SPIDER – {{a system}} for fast {{replication}} or distribution of large content from a single source to multiple sites interconnected over Internet or via a private network. In order to exploit spatial diversity of the underlying network, SPIDER uses an overlay structure composed of dedicated <b>Transit</b> <b>Nodes</b> (TNs). The data transport mechanism in SPIDER leverages this overlay structure to provide a coordinated approach that minimizes the maximum time to replicate to all destination sites (the makespan of content replication). In order to achieve this objective, SPIDER employs two orthogonal components: a) creation of multiple dynamic distribution trees using the <b>transit</b> <b>nodes</b> b) end-to-end reliable data transport with flow control on these trees by chaining point-to-point TCPs. We further present simulations based results to quantify benefits of tree construction algorithms in random topologies.
