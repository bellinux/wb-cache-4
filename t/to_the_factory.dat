5|$|Both Newt Lee, {{after the}} {{discovery}} of Phagan's body, and the police, just after 4a.m., had unsuccessfully tried to telephone Frank early on Sunday, April 27. The police contacted him later that morning and he agreed to accompany them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory.</b> When the police arrived after 7a.m. without telling the specifics of {{what happened at the}} factory, Frank seemed extremely nervous, trembling, and pale; his voice was hoarse, and he was rubbing his hands and asking questions before the police could answer. Frank said he was not familiar with the name Mary Phagan and would need to check his payroll book. The detectives took Frank to the morgue to see Phagan's body and then <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory,</b> where Frank viewed the crime scene and walked the police through the entire building. Frank returned home about 10:45a.m. At this point, Frank was not considered a suspect.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Cogan was {{succeeded by}} Francis Day (1643–1644), Thomas Ivie (1644–1648) and Thomas Greenhill (1648–52 and 1655–58). At {{the end of}} Greenhill's term in 1652, Fort St George was {{elevated}} to a Presidency, independent of Bantam and {{under the leadership of}} the first president, Aaron Baker (1652–1655). However, in 1655 the status of the fort was downgraded to an Agency and made subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> at Surat, until 1684. In 1658, control of all the factories in Bengal was given to Madras, when the English occupied the nearby village of Triplicane.|$|E
5|$|In a new {{affidavit}} (his second affidavit {{and third}} statement), Conley admitted he had lied about his Friday meeting with Frank. He {{said he had}} met Frank on the street on Saturday, and was told to follow him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory.</b> Frank told him to hide in a wardrobe to avoid being seen by two women who were visiting Frank in his office. He said Frank dictated the murder notes for him to write, gave him cigarettes, then told {{him to leave the}} factory. Afterward, Conley said he went out drinking and saw a movie. He said he did not learn of the murder until he went to work on Monday.|$|E

5|$|On 15 October 1944 a train {{carrying}} 700 men on Schindler's {{list was}} initially {{sent to the}} concentration camp at Gross-Rosen, where the men spent about a week before being re-routed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> in Brünnlitz. Three hundred female Schindlerjuden were similarly sent to Auschwitz, where they were in imminent danger of {{being sent to the}} gas chambers. Schindler's usual connections and bribes failed to obtain their release. Finally after he sent his secretary, Hilde Albrecht, with bribes of black market goods, food and diamonds, the women were sent to Brünnlitz after several harrowing weeks in Auschwitz.|$|E
5|$|Once woven, the {{material}} {{is sent to the}} BIS laboratories for testing. After quality testing, {{the material}}, if approved, is returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory.</b> It is then separated into three lots which are dyed saffron, white and green. The Ashoka Chakra is screen printed, stencilled or suitably embroidered onto each side of the white cloth. Care also has to be taken that the chakra is completely visible and synchronised on both sides. Three pieces of the required dimension, one of each colour, are then stitched together according to specifications and the final product is ironed and packed. The BIS then checks the colours and only then can the flag be sold.|$|E

5|$|As {{the women}} go back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory,</b> Micaëla returns and gives José {{a letter and}} a kiss from his mother ("Parle-moi de ma mère!"). He reads that his mother wants him to return home and marry Micaëla, who retreats in shy embarrassment on {{learning}} this. Just as José declares that {{he is ready to}} heed his mother's wishes, the women stream from the factory in great agitation. Zuniga, the officer of the guard, learns that Carmen has attacked a woman with a knife. When challenged, Carmen answers with mocking defiance ("Tra la la... Coupe-moi, brûle-moi"); Zuniga orders José to tie her hands while he prepares the prison warrant. Left alone with José, Carmen beguiles him with a seguidilla, in which she sings of a night of dancing and passion with her lover—whoever that may be—in Lillas Pastia's tavern. Confused yet mesmerised, José agrees to free her hands; as she is led away she pushes her escort to the ground and runs off laughing. José is arrested for dereliction of duty.|$|E
5|$|At {{the scene}} of Marks' game, Detective Allison Kerry finds a message for her former partner, Eric Matthews, and calls him in. Despite {{not wanting to be}} {{involved}} with the case, already dealing with a divorce and estrangement from his son Daniel, Eric reluctantly joins Kerry and Sergeant Daniel Rigg in leading a SWAT team <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> which produced the lock from Marks' trap. There they find and apprehend John Kramer, the Jigsaw Killer, who is weak from cancer. He indicates several computer monitors showing eight people trapped in a house; arsonist Obi Tate, his only known survivor Amanda Young, business man Gus Colyard, gangster Jonas Singer, Laura Hunter, drug dealer Xavier Chavez, prostitute Addison Corday, and Daniel. A nerve agent filling the house will kill them within two hours, but Kramer assures Eric that following his own game, simply sitting and chatting with John, will see his son Daniel returned to him unharmed. At Kerry's urging, Eric agrees in order to buy time for the tech team to arrive and trace the video signal.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944, Monroe met {{photographer}} David Conover, who {{had been}} sent by the U.S. Army Air Forces' First Motion Picture Unit (FMPU) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> to shoot morale-boosting pictures of female workers. Although none of her pictures were used by the FMPU, she quit working at the factory in January 1945 and began modeling for Conover and his friends. She moved out of her in-laws' home, defying them and her husband, and {{signed a contract with}} the Blue Book Model Agency in August 1945. She began to occasionally use the name Jean Norman when working, and had her curly brunette hair straightened and dyed blonde to make her more employable. Her figure was deemed more suitable for pin-up than fashion modeling, and she was featured mostly in advertisements and men's magazines. According to the agency's owner, Emmeline Snively, Monroe was one of its most ambitious and hard-working models; by early 1946, she had appeared on 33 magazine covers for publications such as Pageant, U.S. Camera, Laff, and Peek.|$|E

5|$|New {{orders were}} {{subsequently}} issued demanding further executions. According to eyewitness accounts, the Wehrmacht went {{from house to}} house over the next several days, arresting all males between the ages of 14 and 60. They were herded into a makeshift detention centre at a former rolling-stock factory. Once there, their papers were checked and their names entered into a ledger. When the camp was full, the Wehrmacht ordered groups of 100 prisoners to march to pre-dug mass graves, where they were executed with heavy machine guns. The bodies were then examined for any signs of life; victims that had survived the initial volley were dealt a single bullet to the head. Once the first group had been liquidated, the soldiers returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> and collected the next 100 victims. This process continued until all the men that were rounded up had been killed.|$|E

Wormwood reveals the Bane Mother, and explains the Archetype is a conglomerate of human DNA designed to be investigated so that Bubble Shock could be improved. The Archetype uses an alien communicator Sarah Jane had been given, realising that the signal would be strong enough to kill the Bane Mother, and Sarah Jane, Maria, and the Archetype escape as the factory explodes.|$|E

5|$|Responsibility for {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the electromagnetic separation plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which {{came to be called}} Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. When the plant was started up for testing on schedule in October 1943, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because {{of the power of the}} magnets, and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December Groves ordered a magnet to be broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> to be cleaned. A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings.|$|E
