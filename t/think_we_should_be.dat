500|$|In {{an opinion}} piece for Foreign Policy, Max Boot {{outlines}} his views thusly: [...] "I am socially liberal: I am pro-LGBTQ rights, pro-abortion rights, pro-immigration. I am fiscally conservative: I {{think we need}} to reduce the deficit and get entitlement spending under control. I am pro-environment: I think that climate change is a major threat that we need to address. I am pro-free trade: I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> concluding new trade treaties rather than pulling out of old ones. I am strong on defense: I {{think we need to}} beef up our military to cope with multiple enemies. And I am very much in favor of America acting as a world leader: I believe it is in our own self-interest to promote and defend freedom and free markets as we have been doing {{in one form or another}} since at least 1898." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{have pointed}} out that {{according}} to Federal Election Commission filings in 2009, dozens of Arab and Muslim Americans and Iranian advocacy organizations donated {{tens of thousands of dollars}} to J Street, representing [...] "a small fraction" [...] of the group's fund-raising. Donors included Lebanese-American businessman Richard Abdoo, who is a board member of Amideast and a former board member of the Arab American Institute, and Genevieve Lynch, who is also a member of the National Iranian American Council board. In response, Ben-Ami noted that J Street does not impose a religious or ethnic test to donations. [...] "It would be a very big mistake for pro-Israel organizations to apply a religious or ethnic litmus test for support for Israel from other Americans. I don't think anybody checked to see whether [...] John Hagee was Jewish before he was invited to keynote the AIPAC conference," [...] he said. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> banning Christians, I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> banning Muslims, I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> banning Arabs from finding a way to support Israel, to support its right to exist and to support a program that is designed to secure the future." [...] Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League noted that the ADL also receives donations from non-Jews and does not apply a religious test to donors. More than 20% of the citizens of Israel are Arab, most of whom are Muslim.|$|E

I'm {{not going to talk about}} this issue, I'm not going to read this book, I'm not going to explore this idea.' I don't want anyone thinking about that. It upsets me very much and is not the kind of free society I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> living in." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the November 30, 2005, Hardball, Senator John Warner (R-Virginia) told Chris Matthews [...] "I {{saw that}} for the first time today. And as {{chairman}} of the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, we'll look into that because I'm concerned that our credibility abroad is very important. And if we're manufacturing things or taking our wonderful troops and trying to translate their ideas into something that's more our idea, rather than the trooper's idea, then I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> looking at it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1941, Hellman and Ernest Hemingway co-hosted {{a dinner}} {{to raise money}} for anti-Nazi activists imprisoned in France. New York Governor Herbert Lehman agreed to participate, but withdrew because some of the {{sponsoring}} organizations, he wrote, [...] "have long been connected with Communist activities." [...] Hellman replied: [...] "I do not and I did not ask the politics of any members of the committee and there is nobody who can with honesty vouch for anybody but themselves." [...] She assured him the funds raised would be used as promised and later provided him with a detailed accounting. The next month she wrote him: [...] "I am sure it will make you sad and ashamed as it did me to know that, of the seven resignations out of 147 sponsors, five were Jews. Of all the peoples in the world, I <b>think,</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> the last to hold back help, on any grounds, from those who fought for us." ...|$|E

"At laste Irish, my boy," [...] {{the doctor}} said, as {{surprised}} as Charlie had <b>been.</b> [...] "To <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>been</b> talking Swedish to each other, instead of our native tongue. And what is your name? And {{what is it you}} are doing here, as a Swede, at all?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Following the release, doubts were {{expressed}} whether Megrahi was as ill as claimed by MacAskill {{in his statement}} to the Scottish Parliament. The guidance on compassionate release of a terminally ill prisoner under Scottish law specifies that death must be likely to occur [...] "soon"; there is no fixed time limit but a life expectancy of three months is suggested as [...] "appropriate". The Labour MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife and a Minister in the previous Labour administration, Dr. Richard Simpson, accused the Scottish justice minister of failing to conduct sufficient checks before deciding to release Megrahi. Dr. Simpson, {{a former member of}} the British Association of Urological Surgeons' prostate cancer working group who specialised in prostate disease research, expressed doubt that Megrahi would die within the next three months and claimed that he could live for eight months, going on to say that, [...] "Kenny MacAskill released him apparently on the advice of just one doctor whose status is not clear and who is not named." [...] He added that a second specialist opinion in palliative care should have been sought before the release. A source close to the justice secretary called Simpson's comments [...] "tasteless" [...] and added: [...] "I really don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> speculating on the day somebody is going to die." ...|$|E

[...] "But {{although}} some articles of food might be compressed, I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> ever <b>be</b> able to compress rice or ghee. A handful of rice, when it is boiled, makes enough for a meal; and I don't imagine that it could possibly be condensed more than that." ...|$|R

"That is true enough, Abdool; and I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>been</b> {{much better}} off, if Scindia had laid hands on us {{after we had}} bearded him in his tent.

6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} we shall weather them as we have done before," [...] said the Colonel. [...] "Still, I can't help admitting that just now I feel--a little tired--and <b>am</b> commencing to <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>been</b> better {{prepared}} for the struggle had we worked a trifle harder during the recent era of prosperity.
