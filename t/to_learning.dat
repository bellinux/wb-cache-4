Kanō applied himself thoroughly <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> Kitō-ryū, believing Iikubo's throwing techniques {{in particular to}} be better than in the schools he had previously studied. It is Iikubo who issued Kanō's only verified jūjutsu rank and teaching credential, namely a certificate of Menkyo (not Menkyo kaiden) in Nihonden Kitō Jūdō, dated October 1883.|$|E
5|$|Classic {{learning}} {{theories and}} the modern dual-coding theory support the introduction of interesting, tangential details <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> content. There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.|$|E

5|$|Chatwin went to Australia {{to learn}} more about Aboriginal culture, {{specifically}} the songlines or dreaming tracks. Each songline is a personal story and functions as a creation tale and a map, and each Aboriginal Australian has their own songline. Chatwin thought the songlines could be a metaphor he could use to support his ideas about humans' need to wander, which he believed was genetic. However, he struggled to fully understand and describe the songlines and their place in Aboriginal culture. This was due to Chatwin's approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> about the songlines. He spent several weeks in 1983 and 1984 in Australia, during which he primarily relied on non-Aboriginal people for information. Chatwin was limited by his inability to speak the Aboriginal languages. He interviewed people involved in the Land Rights movement, and he alienated many of them because he was oblivious to the politics and also because he was an admirer of Strehlow's work.|$|E
5|$|In Western Europe, after Theophrastus, botany {{passed through}} a bleak period of 1800 years when little {{progress}} was made and, indeed, many of the early insights were lost. As Europe entered the Middle Ages (5th to 15th centuries), a period of disorganised feudalism and indifference <b>to</b> <b>learning,</b> China, India and the Arab world enjoyed a golden age. Chinese philosophy had followed a similar path {{to that of the}} ancient Greeks. The Chinese dictionary-encyclopaedia Erh Ya probably dates from about 300 BC and describes about 334 plants classed as trees or shrubs, each with a common name and illustration. Between 100 and 1700 AD many new works on pharmaceutical botany were produced including encyclopaedic accounts and treatises compiled for the Chinese imperial court. These were free of superstition and myth with carefully researched descriptions and nomenclature; they included cultivation information and notes on economic and medicinal uses — and even elaborate monographs on ornamental plants. But there was no experimental method and no analysis of the plant sexual system, nutrition, or anatomy.|$|E

5|$|In the yeshiva world, the {{brightest}} students are highly desirable as chavrusas. However, there are {{pros and cons}} <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> with chavrusas who are stronger, weaker, or equal in knowledge and ability to the student. A stronger chavrusa will correct and fill in the student's knowledge and help him improve his learning techniques, acting more like a teacher. With a chavrusa who is equal in knowledge and ability, the student is forced to prove his point with logic rather than by right of seniority, which improves his ability to think logically, analyze other people's opinions objectively, and accept criticism. With a weaker chavrusa, who often worries over and questions each step, the student is forced to understand the material thoroughly, refine and organize his thoughts in a logical structure, present his viewpoint clearly, {{and be ready to}} justify each and every point. The stronger chavrusa helps the student acquire a great deal of information, but the weaker chavrusa helps the student learn how to learn. Yeshiva students are usually advised to have one of each of these three types of chavrusas in order to develop on all three levels.|$|E
5|$|Lilly became {{interested}} in chemicals as a teen. In 1854, while {{on a trip to}} visit his aunt and uncle in Lafayette, Indiana, the sixteen-year-old Lilly visited Henry Lawrence's Good Samaritan Drug Store, a local apothecary shop, where he watched Lawrence prepare pharmaceutical drugs. Lilly completed a four-year apprenticeship with Lawrence to become a chemist and pharmacist. In addition <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> to mix chemicals, Lawrence taught Lilly how to manage funds and operate a business. In 1858, after earning a certificate of proficiency from his apprenticeship, Lilly left the Good Samaritan to work for Israel Spencer and Sons, a wholesale and retail druggist in Lafayette, before moving to Indianapolis to take a position at the Perkins and Coons Pharmacy.|$|E
5|$|Reading is {{considered}} to be a key element of vocabulary development in school-age children. Before children are able to read on their own, children can learn from others reading to them. Learning vocabulary from these experiences includes using context, as well as explicit explanations of words and/or events in the story. This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide explanation and provide a visual reference or comparisons, usually to prior knowledge and past experiences. Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child's repetition of the new word back to the adult. When a child begins to learn to read, their print vocabulary and oral vocabulary tend to be the same, as children use their vocabulary knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms. These two forms of vocabulary are usually equal up until grade 3. Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language, print vocabulary begins to expand beyond oral vocabulary. By age 10, children's vocabulary development through reading moves away from learning concrete words <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> abstract words.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this review}} study is (a) to define the concept of {{opportunities}} <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> (OTL) as a theoretical category, (b) to present selected research tools that are most commonly used for investigating opportunities, and (c) to compare differences in defining and using opportunities <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> as a theoretical category in the Czech Republic and in the U. S., where the concept originated. In {{the first part of}} the study, a specific historical development of defining opportunities <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> is presented. Initially, the opportunities <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> were viewed as a theoretical category comprising the coherence between content of teaching and content requirements of (standardized) tests or curricula. Later, the scope of opportunities <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> expanded towards examining school-dependent variables and school-independent variables related to school performance of students. In the second part of the study opportunities <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> are operationalised, including examples of methods and techniques used for their investigation. On an example of selected research, the study shows that the concept of opportunities <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> in the U.

This contrasts with the use of opportunities <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> as a theoretical concept in the Czech Republic, where opportunities <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> mainly represent a theoretical basis for conducting microanalyses of teaching...|$|R

40|$|This study {{argues that}} to improve school effectiveness, schools and {{educators}} {{should focus on}} even more basic elements than those posited by other research. The focus should be on providing a basic opportunity <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> by having the school open every day; the teacher present; students present and ready to learn; and instructional time on task. The educational value of that basic opportunity then depends on how teachers and students use the time available during the day, whether materials are present and used by them, and whether class sizes are reasonable.

5|$|Several {{recent studies}} have shown that adding seductive details does not have a {{significant}} impact on learner outcomes. Park et al. (2011) looked at cognitive load theory to explain these controversial results. The experiment asked high school students to learn about biology using a multimedia environment (one with seductive details and one without). The experiment also varied the cognitive load for the students. The results showed that students performed significantly higher when seductive details were present in a low cognitive load environment as compared with all other conditions. Another study by Park et al. (2015) showed that while seductive details were detrimental <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> in high cognitive load text conditions, seductive details actually improved motivation and learning outcomes in narration conditions where the cognitive load was low. This means that slideshows or webcasts with well-prepared narration that use motivating bits of information increase learner motivation.|$|E

Even prior <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> he was the Avatar, Aang {{distinguished}} himself by {{becoming one of the}} youngest Airbending Masters in history by inventing a new technique. As a result of Fire Lord Sozin's increasingly hostile attitude towards the other nations, the senior monks decided to reveal Aang's nature as the Avatar four years before the traditional age (Avatars are usually told of their status once they turn 16) and relocate him to one of the other Air Temples. Learning that he was to be taken from Gyatso caused Aang to flee the monastery on his flying bison, Appa, before being caught by a storm; the life-or-death conditions triggered the Avatar State, encasing the young Avatar and his bison in an air-pocket among icebergs, where he remained suspended for a century.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the {{intention}} <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> has no direct effect on memory encoding.
