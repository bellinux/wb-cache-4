5|$|With no {{above ground}} remains, the exact {{location}} of <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> had been lost, and so in the 1840s, the editor of the Leicester Chronicle, James Thompson, tried, and failed, to attempt to locate <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> church. In the 1850s the Leicester Architectural and Archaeological Society would also carry out excavations, but also failed to locate <b>the</b> <b>abbey.</b> Prior to the 9th Earl of Dysart's donation of <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> precinct, another attempt was undertaken, but again, no trace of <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> was found.|$|E

5|$|Another {{concern of}} the chronicle was the {{acquisition}} of land by <b>the</b> <b>abbey.</b> The work incorporates three pre-existing inventories of the abbey's possessions, and records each gift to <b>the</b> <b>abbey,</b> giving the grantor and occasionally details of the grantor's life. This detailed record of the various rights and possessions of <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> was useful if those possessions needed to be defended against outside or inside conflicts. The Liber {{was used by the}} monks to defend their claims to be the real heirs of the abbey's rights and property rather than the bishops, after the conversion of <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> into a bishopric. The chronicle also records the division of property between the monks and the newly appointed bishop. According to the chronicler, the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate for the needs of the monks. Later the chronicle records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between the monks and the episcopate. The chronicle also records the conflict between <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> and various Bishops of Lincoln, which had continued until <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> became a bishopric in 1109.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} twentieth century <b>the</b> <b>abbey's</b> {{residential}} and service buildings were remodeled as a museum, presenting prehistoric, Gallo-Roman and medieval finds from Auxerre. An exhibition in 1990 brought <b>the</b> <b>abbey's</b> cultural impact into focus. <b>The</b> former <b>abbey</b> church remains in use for worship at stated times.|$|R
50|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries, <b>the</b> <b>abbey's</b> {{fortunes}} {{continued to}} diminish. The number of monks and <b>the</b> <b>abbey's</b> wealth dwindled, {{and it was}} finally abandoned in 1796 {{in the wake of}} the French Revolution.|$|R
50|$|While {{maintaining}} {{the lifestyle of}} Benedictine monks, <b>the</b> <b>abbey's</b> community continues <b>the</b> important work of procuring funds for the Congregation's international missions. This includes {{the publication of a}} mission periodical, which is regularly distributed to <b>the</b> <b>abbey's</b> thousands of benefactors.|$|R
5|$|Around 1170, Keynsham Abbey {{was founded}} by the Victorine {{congregation}} of canon regulars. Archeological evidence suggests that <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> was built over {{the site of the}} previous Saxon Minster church. The settlement developed into a medieval market town, and <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> of Keynsham was given ownership of the Keynsham Hundred.|$|E
5|$|Centwine (676–685) was {{the first}} Saxon patron of Glastonbury Abbey. King Edmund Ironside was buried at <b>the</b> <b>abbey.</b> The Domesday Book {{indicates}} that in the hundred of Glastingberiensis, <b>the</b> <b>Abbey</b> was the Lord in 1066 prior {{to the arrival of}} William the Conqueror then tenant-in chief with Godwin as Lord of Glastingberi in 1086.|$|E

5|$|During Edward's reign, Æthelwig {{worked to}} recover some of <b>the</b> <b>abbey's</b> estates {{that had been}} granted {{to others in the}} past but had not been {{returned}} to <b>the</b> <b>abbey's</b> custody. He managed to restore <b>the</b> <b>abbey's</b> possession of a number of these lost estates. A large section of the description of the abbot's life in the Chronicon is concerned with a listing of estates that Æthelwig acquired or recovered. The estates listed were in the counties of Worcestershire, Warwickshire, and Gloucestershire.|$|R
50|$|In 1220, under Emperor Frederick II and his chancellor, Archbishop Engelbert of Cologne, the Benedictines were evicted and {{replaced}} by Cistercian nuns who had previously been living at the Salvatorberg in Aachen, to whom <b>the</b> <b>abbey's</b> possessions were transferred. At the same time <b>the</b> <b>abbey's</b> reichsfreiheit was confirmed.|$|R

5|$|Despite Abbot Sadyngton's {{apparent}} financial corruption, <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> {{appeared to}} be financially stable: the abbey's monastic buildings had recently been extensively rebuilt and <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> had a substantial annual income of £1180.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages {{the town}} largely {{depended}} on <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> {{but was also}} a centre for the wool trade until the 18th century. A Saxon-era canal connected <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> to the River Brue. Richard Whiting, the last Abbot of Glastonbury, was executed {{with two of his}} monks on 15 November 1539 during the dissolution of the monasteries.|$|E
5|$|Henry III {{added to}} the {{endowment}} left by Peter des Roches, donating farmland, urban property in Southampton and elsewhere, and spiritual revenues from churches. By 1291, taxation returns show that <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> had a clear annual revenue of £81, a comfortable income. However, shortly afterwards a period of bad management resulted in <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> accruing substantial debts, and it was soon almost bankrupt. In 1328 the government was forced to appoint an administrator, John of Mere, to address the crisis. Despite forcing the abbot to apply revenues to debt repayment and to sell many of the estates, the operation was only partly successful. Ten years later <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> was again appealing to the king for help with a disastrous financial situation. The monks blamed their problems {{on the cost of}} providing hospitality to the many travellers by sea, and the king's sailors who landed at <b>the</b> <b>abbey.</b> The king provided some small grants enabling <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> to overcome its difficulties but the property sales meant that the abbey's income never recovered and it settled into what has been described as genteel poverty.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Benedictine <b>Abbey</b> in Tyniec {{according}} to some hypotheses was also founded by Bolesław. In 1124 the Papal legate issued the confirmation of the goods received from <b>the</b> <b>Abbey's</b> estates.|$|R

50|$|The Gesta abbatum Sithiensium (Deeds of the Abbots of Saint-Bertin) is a {{combination}} of chronicle and cartulary. Folcuin incoporates numerous charters from <b>the</b> <b>abbey's</b> archives into his historical narrative, which begins with <b>the</b> <b>abbey's</b> foundation around 650 and continues to 961/2. It was composed {{at the request of the}} lay abbot, Adalolf.|$|R
5|$|In 1148, Pope Eugene III granted <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> an {{exemption}} on paying tithe for their newly acquired land and livestock. This was granted {{on the condition}} that there was to be no impropriety or violence when electing an abbot, and that those who donated money to <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> could be buried within it, regardless of whether they had been excommunicated.|$|E
5|$|In 1538 <b>the</b> <b>Abbey</b> {{with all}} land and {{possessions}} was surrendered by the monks to Henry VIII {{in the course}} of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The main buildings of <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> were then demolished, although some of the decorative floor tiles were relaid in the neighbouring Church of St Peter and St Paul. The whole property and advowson was then granted to Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, later 1st Duke of Somerset. On his execution in 1552 it reverted to The Crown. Stone from <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> was used in many of the local buildings. In 1872 when collecting stone labourers found a blue stone coffin lid under which the pavement of the 14th century lady chapel was uncovered. In 1924 a pageant was held at the site, involving around 500 people, representing the history of <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> from its foundation to the dissolution.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> {{was passed}} into state care by the then owner, Tankerville Chamberlayne, one time M.P. for Southampton. Conservation and archaeological work on <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> has continued.|$|E
5000|$|The only {{portion of}} the medieval monastery which survives is the [...] "much restored", former abbot's tower, which dates from 14th or 15th century. This was {{incorporated}} into <b>the</b> <b>abbey's</b> guesthouse, which was constructed during 1982 and 1994, when <b>the</b> <b>abbey's</b> precinct was rebuilt.The abbey's former well, which was located in the crypt of <b>the</b> former <b>abbey</b> and which may have dated from Saxon times, was destroyed when <b>the</b> new <b>abbey</b> was built. A church was erected and opened in March 1884. In that year, reconstruction of the south wing of the monastery began; {{it was intended to}} include a refectory and cloister.|$|R
50|$|During the Napoleonic Wars <b>the</b> <b>abbey's</b> {{territory}} {{was occupied}} by Bavarian troops in 1802 and was formerly dissolved in the subsequent German mediatization (Reichsdeputationshauptschluss). <b>The</b> <b>abbey's</b> territory {{as well as the}} Imperial city of Kempten were annexed by Bavaria, in 1819 both territories were merged into a single communal entity within the Kingdom of Bavaria.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>abbey's</b> {{wine was}} stored in three vaulted south-facing cellars. Levels of {{consumption}} were high but the wine had a low alcohol content {{and only a}} short shelf-life. It came from <b>the</b> <b>abbey's</b> properties situated near Cluses, Thonon, Geneva and the more remote Salins. The cellars also had an elaborate drainage and cleaning system.|$|R
5|$|In the 15th century <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> {{began to}} lease out its land (most {{probably}} {{as a solution}} to their falling income). By 1477 only the demesne lands in Leicester, Stoughton and Ingarsby remained un-leased, and were directly farmed by <b>the</b> <b>abbey.</b>|$|E

5|$|Kirkstall Abbey is {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} piece of architecture from this period in Leeds. <b>The</b> <b>abbey,</b> which is a Cistercian foundation, was begun {{on the banks of}} the River Aire in 1152. <b>The</b> <b>abbey</b> was disbanded and the buildings ruined during the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII. Although Cistercian abbeys were numerous in England, many were located in remote areas and, unlike several Benedictine and Augustinian abbeys, did not survive the Dissolution by being reused as parish churches. At Kirkstall Abbey, the ruins are particularly well preserved and show an austere form of Norman architecture with some later Gothic additions and embellishments. The remnants of most of the monastic buildings are sufficiently intact to display the domestic arrangement and function of the monastery. <b>The</b> <b>Abbey</b> House Museum keeps records and displays artefacts from <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> as well as from other eras across Leeds. Paintings of <b>the</b> <b>Abbey</b> have come from artists as renowned as J. M. W. Turner and Thomas Girtin. In 1889 <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> was purchased by Colonel John North and presented to Leeds City Council. The council restored parts of <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> and made it safe for public enjoyment before opening it in 1895.|$|E

50|$|When in 1958 the Roman Catholic Diocese of Essen was created, <b>the</b> former <b>abbey</b> church became Essen Cathedral, {{to which}} <b>the</b> <b>abbey's</b> {{treasury}} (Essener Domschatz), including the famous Golden Madonna of Essen, also passed.|$|R
5|$|Leicester Abbey {{followed}} a similar format: Dr. Cave's tenancy {{was cut short}} in 1551, when King Edward VI granted <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> to William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton, brother of the former Queen Catherine Parr. Much of <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> stone was then {{used to create a}} new mansion on the site, for the Marquess. The Marquess only held <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> for two years: after supporting Lady Jane Grey's claim to the throne, in 1553, on the accession of Bloody Mary, he was arrested and his lands were confiscated. Mary granted <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> and mansion to her catholic supporter Edward Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings of Loughborough, however he too fell from favour when Mary's sister Elizabeth I came to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Leicester Abbey {{was granted}} in 1539, on a 21-year lease, to Dr. Francis Cave, {{one of the}} commissioners who had {{negotiated}} the surrender of <b>the</b> <b>abbey.</b> During this period <b>the</b> <b>abbey</b> was rapidly demolished with the stone sold to meet the high demand within the town of Leicester.|$|E
