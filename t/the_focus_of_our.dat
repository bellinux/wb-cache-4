The Institute has also successfully handled the HR issues in the recent merger of various banks. Presently the focus of the consulting activities is more on IRM, designing ICAAP, Organizational Restructuring, Manpower Planning, Customer Relationship Management, Customer Service, etc.|$|E
50|$|Congressional Focus and Resource Issues. Public {{expectations}} of access could have significant cost implications for CRS—both {{in responding to}} requests and in answering public concerns regarding products provided. Widespread public access to CRS products could cause analysts to become more conscious {{of the need to}} address views, methods, disciplines, and {{expectations of}} a non-congressional audience, and thereby shift <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> products away from their current emphasis on the congressional audience. As a result, our congressional clients, recognizing such a change in the content and protection afforded our work, would either request more confidential memoranda, which are available only to the requester, or, more significantly, no longer have confidence in CRS ' ability to truly serve as their adjunct staff. As we know, memoranda are more resource intensive to prepare than products which are available for distribution to all Members and committees and take advantage of economies of scale. Writing for a public audience also has the potential to alter the extent to which CRS products can rely on a certain level of knowledge {{on the part of the}} reader, complicating the analyst's task and perhaps increasing the length of products. There is also the potential for incurring significant costs in any process of creating an effective system for making CRS work available to the public, the monitoring of products for necessary redaction, and the cost of a likely increase in the volume of requests for tailored individual requests for written products that are not made available to the public.|$|E
