5|$|Annealing is {{the process}} of heating the steel to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature to relieve local internal stresses. It does not create a general softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked up within the material. Annealing goes through three phases: recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth. The temperature required <b>to</b> <b>anneal</b> a particular steel depends on the type of annealing to be achieved and the alloying constituents.|$|E

25|$|The {{sample to}} analyze is {{optionally}} {{mixed with a}} chemical denaturant if so desired, usually SDS for proteins or urea for nucleic acids. SDS is an anionic detergent that denatures secondary and non–disulfide–linked tertiary structures, and additionally applies a negative charge to each protein in proportion to its mass. Urea breaks the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs of the nucleic acid, causing the constituent strands <b>to</b> <b>anneal.</b> Heating the samples to at least 60°C further promotes denaturation.|$|E

By means of metalography observation and micro-hardness measurement, {{the effect of}} annealing temperature and time on the homogenization processes were studied, which indicated that the homogenized microstructure was more sensitive <b>to</b> <b>annealing</b> temperature than <b>to</b> <b>annealing</b> time. An optimized homogenizing process 470 ℃x 14 h was suggested to improve the deformability of ZK 60 alloy...|$|R

500|$|Next, {{the glass}}–cutter cut the cylinder, {{and the glass}} was flattened. It was {{necessary}} to gradually cool the glass, {{a process known as}} annealing, to prevent it from breaking. [...] A lehr or annealing oven was used <b>to</b> <b>anneal</b> the product. A typical 20th-century lehr was a large conveyor inside a long oven. The newly made glass gradually moved from the hot end of the lehr to its opposite end, which was at room temperature. The glass would then be cut into the desired window glass size, placed in a box, and moved to inventory. [...] It is not known if (or when) the lehrs at the Hartford City plant had conveyors.|$|E
500|$|Homologous {{recombination}} via the SDSA pathway {{occurs in}} cells that divide through mitosis and meiosis {{and results in}} non-crossover products. [...] In this model, the invading 3' strand is extended along the recipient DNA duplex by a DNA polymerase, and is released as the Holliday junction between the donor and recipient DNA molecules slides in a process called branch migration. [...] The newly synthesized 3' end of the invading strand is then able <b>to</b> <b>anneal</b> to the other 3' overhang in the damaged chromosome through complementary base pairing. [...] After the strands anneal, a small flap of DNA can sometimes remain. [...] Any such flaps are removed, and the SDSA pathway finishes with the resealing, also known as ligation, of any remaining single-stranded gaps.|$|E
500|$|As DNA {{around the}} double-strand break is cut back, the {{single-stranded}} 3' overhangs being produced are coated with the RPA protein, which prevents the 3' overhangs from sticking to themselves. [...] A protein called Rad52 then binds {{each of the}} repeat sequences {{on either side of}} the break, and aligns them to enable the two complementary repeat sequences <b>to</b> <b>anneal.</b> [...] After annealing is complete, leftover non-homologous flaps of the 3' overhangs are cut away by a set of nucleases, known as Rad1/Rad10, which are brought to the flaps by the Saw1 and Slx4 proteins. [...] New DNA synthesis fills in any gaps, and ligation restores the DNA duplex as two continuous strands. [...] The DNA sequence between the repeats is always lost, as is one of the two repeats. [...] The SSA pathway is considered mutagenic since it results in such deletions of genetic material.|$|E

2500|$|Matrix-assisted laser {{desorption}} ionization/time {{of flight}} mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) combined with base extension after PCR allows cell free fetal [...] DNA detection with single base specificity and single DNA molecule sensitivity.

40|$|International audienceMicrostructure {{evolution}} {{has been studied}} in the nickel-based superalloy PER® 72 subjected to hot torsion, <b>to</b> <b>annealing</b> below the primary γ' solvus temperature and <b>to</b> <b>annealing</b> at a supersolvus temperature, with a special emphasis on grain size and twin content. Dynamic abnormal grain growth occurs {{before the onset of}} dynamic recrystallization. The resulting bimodal grain size distribution affects the grain-coarsening kinetics at the supersolvus temperature, so that the final microstructures depend on the former straining stages. As a consequence, the twin content does not follow a univocal relationship with the average grain size. The grain boundary velocity history before reaching the final grain size is a contributing factor, and this is notably related to the initial grain size distribution width. Dynamically recrystallized microstructures are by nature more homogeneous and thus give rise to lower rates in supersolvus grain coarsening, and accordingly lead to relatively lower twin densities...|$|R
25|$|Further {{optimization}} can {{be achieved}} by designing oligos that target the lagging strand in DNA replication because targeting the lagging strand results in a higher frequency of recombinants. In DNA replication, RNA primers must be inserted along the lagging strand so that DNA polymerase is able to synthesize the strand in the 5’ to 3’ direction. This discontinuous synthesis results in the lagging strand being more exposed which allows for easier beta-mediated annealing of the oligo to the target DNA than when compared <b>to</b> <b>annealing</b> <b>to</b> the leading strand.|$|R
