Private companies may provide only the patient transport elements of ambulance care (i.e. non-urgent), but in some places, they are contracted to provide emergency care, or to form a 'second tier' response, where they only respond to emergencies {{when all of the}} full-time emergency ambulance crews are busy. This may mean that a government or other service provide the 'emergency' cover, whilst a private firm may be charged with 'minor injuries' such as cuts, bruises or even helping the mobility-impaired if they have for example fallen and simply need help <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> but do not need treatment. This system has the benefit of keeping emergency crews available at all times for genuine emergencies. These organisations may also provide services known as 'Stand-by' cover at industrial sites or at special events. [...] In Latin America, private ambulance companies are often the only readily available EMS service ...|$|E
60|$|Pony {{said he was}} {{not sick}} at all; just tired; and that was true; {{he felt as if he}} never wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "How long must we {{keep this}} up, Shags?" [...] asked Scraps, who was {{constantly}} tripping and tumbling down, only <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> {{with a laugh}} at her mishap.|$|E
60|$|Beside him, on {{a little}} stool close to the galley-fire, sat Tim Rokens-- not that Mr Rokens was cold--far from it. He was, to judge from appearances, much hotter than was agreeable. But Tim had come there {{and sat down to}} light his pipe, and being rather phlegmatic when not {{actively}} employed, he preferred to be partially roasted for a few minutes <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{is to be}} done?" [...] Ben asked. [...] "If we were <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> sail <b>again</b> {{we should}} drift away so far to leeward we should {{never be able to}} beat back." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2003, footy was reborn in Hanoi {{under the}} Hanoi Swans banner with a tri-nations tournament against Hong Kong and Thailand. In 2007, a {{movement}} started in Saigon <b>to</b> <b>get</b> footy <b>up</b> <b>again</b> {{with the goal}} of combining with Hanoi to form a national team, the Vietnam Swans.|$|R
6000|$|... "Right in the shin. Faith, I {{went down}} so sudden that I thought I had trod in a hole; and I {{was making a}} {{scramble}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> when young Dawson said: ...|$|E
60|$|When I am totally prostrated (did I {{mention that}} I was totally prostrated by Marian's letter?) it always takes me three days <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> I was very unreasonable--I {{expected}} {{three days of}} quiet. Of course I didn't get them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not very, thank goodness. Still, if he {{fell down}} {{he might not}} be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> {{especially}} if he'd hurt himself at all. Half a second. Let me get on some boots, and I'll come out and look. Shan't be long.|$|E
60|$|As the {{schooner}} {{rounded up}} her sails came down, and she headed straight toward the brig. The {{captain of the}} Belle Marie stood up in the stern-sheet of the boat, shouting and waving his hands and gesticulating <b>to</b> them <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> sail <b>again.</b> Those on board the schooner looked on in surprise, unable to guess his meaning.|$|R
25|$|On Mount Royals {{launch date}} of April 9, 1902, she got hung {{up during the}} launch, and after two hours was freed, only <b>to</b> <b>get</b> caught <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> this time {{swinging}} into the bank. It would be several more days before she was successfully launched into the bay. A bad launch {{was considered to be}} an ill omen and, in this case, was one that would be fulfilled.|$|R
5000|$|After {{graduating from}} Western High School, she {{attended}} Goucher College, an all women's college in central Baltimore {{very close to}} her home. She participated in athletics at Goucher College, and [...] "learned to lose without bitterness, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and try <b>again,</b> <b>to</b> never feel resentment," [...] a trait that would serve her well through many years of political victories and defeats.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Ratray, {{though he}} had {{returned}} to Europe, gave the most cheering accounts of the B. B. C. It was in the most flourishing state. Shares sure <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> He had sold out entirely {{on account of his}} liver. Must come home--the doctor said so.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Tod descended safely {{from the}} chair, and {{endeavored}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> with the pail of water. He intended to hang {{it from the}} hook, dangling {{over the head of}} Tommy Brock, {{in order to make a}} sort of shower-bath, worked by a string, through the window.|$|E
60|$|No {{sooner had}} Blow-Blast taken in their danger than he raised such a mighty wind {{that all the}} king's army was blown down like so many nine-pins, and as they were quite unable <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> Moscione and his companions {{proceeded}} on their way without further let or hindrance.|$|E
50|$|When she {{was fifteen}} years old, George Balanchine {{asked her to}} perform {{with him in a}} dance he choreographed for a polio charity benefit. In an eerie portent of things to come, he played a {{character}} named Polio, and Le Clercq was his victim who became paralyzed and fell to the floor. Then, children tossed dimes at her character, prompting her <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and dance <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "There is one pleasure, I know, Maggie, {{that your}} deepest dismalness will never resist," [...] said Lucy, {{beginning}} to speak {{as soon as}} she entered the room. [...] "That is music, and I mean you to have quite a riotous feast of it. I mean you <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> your playing <b>again,</b> which used to be so much better than mine, when we were at Laceham." ...|$|R
5000|$|Combining orchestral disco styles with a Donald Duck-esque {{voice as}} the main plot point, the story within [...] "Disco Duck" [...] centers around a man at a dance party who is {{overcome}} by the urge <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and [...] "get down" [...] in a duck-like manner. When the music stops, he sits down, but when he decides <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and dance <b>again,</b> he finds {{that everyone in the}} room is now doing his dance.|$|R
60|$|Brooke, {{who asked}} no more questions, {{contrived}} {{to make his}} way to the hotel, and flung himself down to rest, when he had ascertained when the Pacific express came in. Important as it was that he should see Devine, he was, however, very uncertain whether he would be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|Burning with indignation, Larry {{felt himself}} {{go down in}} a heap, and at once tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> At {{the same time the}} soldier beneath him gave him a shove which pitched him several feet forward. He landed up against the {{lieutenant}} with considerable force, and in a twinkle the officer went overboard, head first, into the water and mud where the casco had stuck fast.|$|E
60|$|Whether Bob {{were really}} {{capable of doing}} this, Cynthia could not tell. She {{believed}} he was. Perhaps she really {{did not intend to}} go upstairs just then. To his intense relief she seated herself on a straight-backed chair near the door, although she had the air of being about <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> at any minute. It was not a surrender, not at all--but a parley, at least.|$|E
2500|$|As war {{correspondent}} Ernie Pyle, who {{was later}} killed in action, would write, [...] "Major General Terry Allen {{was one of}} my favorite people. Partly because he didn't give a damn for hell or high water; partly because he was more colorful than most; and partly because he was the only general outside the Air Forces I could call by his first name. If there was one thing in the world Allen lived and breathed for, it was to fight. He had been all shot up in the last war, and he seemed not the least averse <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> shot <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> This was no intellectual war with him. He hated Germans and Italians like vermin." ...|$|R
50|$|Several {{years of}} {{fruitful}} operation later, on the fateful day of February 14, 1984, {{just after the}} faculty and staff had their Valentine's Day Get Together, sounds of sirens startled the people of Nagtahan. The CAM building was on Fire! It took several years for the school <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> It even went {{up to a point}} when the school was to be closed down (During the early 1990s). However, parents soon clamored for the reopening of classes and in 1992, funds were raised. In 1993, CAM re-opened with a one-storey, three room building. This building would then be replaced by a three-story, fifteen-room building and a one-story, four-room building.|$|R
60|$|She {{went to the}} book-case--her dark figure plainly {{visible in}} the {{moonlight}} that flooded the little room. She staggered {{and put her hand}} to her head; giddy, to all appearance, from extreme fatigue. She recovered herself, and took a book from the shelf. She leaned against the wall after she had possessed herself of the book. Too weary, as it seemed, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> stairs <b>again</b> without a little rest. Her arm-chair was near her. Better rest, for a moment or two, to be had in that than could be got by leaning against the wall. She sat down heavily in the chair, with the book on her lap. One of her arms hung over the arm of the chair, with the hand closed, apparently holding something.|$|R
60|$|With what {{intention}} Martin made a stride {{forward at}} these words, {{it is impossible}} to say. It is enough to know that Tom Pinch caught him in his arms, and that, at the same moment, Mr Pecksniff stepped back so hastily, that he missed his footing, tumbled over a chair, and fell in a sitting posture on the ground; where he remained without an effort <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> with his head in a corner, perhaps considering it the safest place.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Walters in an apologetic tone, [...] "I suppose {{all this}} is true, but I must point out that when we slipped down the gully it was {{impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> Then there were some big crevasses in the glacier and I had a half-drunk man to help across; I really didn't know he would drink too much when I gave him the flask. However, although perhaps I was rather careless, I hope you won't forbid my seeing Lawrence." ...|$|E
60|$|For the present, however, {{she was in}} bed, under a quilt made of {{coloured}} cloth scraps; {{but however}} it might be with her heart-strings, she did not seem likely <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> It was hay time, and it appeared that no one did come to school in hay and harvest seasons, {{so that there was}} time to consider what could be done. Dr Fogram was invited to dinner to hold consultation with the ladies, whom the captain would not leave to any conclusion as to the schools.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{must have}} been nearly an hour later that {{something}} did begin to happen, Baas. It was as though sacks filled with chaff were being beaten against stone walls there in the cave. Ah! thought I to myself, your stomach is beginning to ache, Eater-up-of-Bena, and, as that goat had little horns on its head--to which I tied two of the bags of the poison, Baas--and, like all snakes, no doubt you have spikes in your throat pointing downwards, you won't be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> Then--I expect this was after the poison-sugar had begun to melt nicely in the serpent's stomach, Baas--there was a noise as though a whole company of girls were dancing a war-dance in the cave to a music of hisses.|$|R
2500|$|Then in 1900, Cunningham sent Bonser down to Victoria {{to design}} a sternwheeler. This would become the Hazelton, and under Bonser’s command she soon proved to be {{superior}} to the other boats on the Skeena. In her first season, she went to Hazelton thirteen times, making the trip upstream in forty hours and downstream in ten. Realizing that the Strathcona and the Caledonia could not compete, the HBC built a third sternwheeler, the Mount Royal and hired Captain Johnson as her pilot. On her launch date, April 9, 1902, she got hung up during her launch, and after two hours was freed, only <b>to</b> <b>get</b> caught <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> A bad launch {{was considered to be}} an ill omen and, in this case, was one that would be fulfilled.|$|R
5000|$|Swann responded [...] "I'm {{still not}} 100 percent. I value my health, but I've had no dizzy spells. I read what Harris said. He {{was trying to}} intimidate me. He said I'd be afraid out there. He needn't worry. He doesn't know Lynn Swann. He can't scare me or the team. I said to myself, 'The hell with it, I'm gonna play.' Sure, I thought about the {{possibility}} of being reinjured. But it's like being thrown by a horse. You have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and ride <b>again</b> immediately or you may be scared the rest of your life." ...|$|R
60|$|Neither their {{unity of}} {{conviction}} concerning the general fact nor the surprising deduction {{from it in}} Verrian's case operated to make them refuse the help of their captives in getting home. When they had bound up their tumbled hair, in some cases, and repaired the ravages of war among their feathers and furs and draperies, in other cases, they accepted {{the hands of the}} late enemy at difficult points of the path. But they ran forward when they neared the house, and they were prompt to scream upon Mrs. Westangle that there never had been such a success or such fun, and that they were almost dead, and soon as they had something to eat they were going to bed and never going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{latter was}} {{addressed}} to a man, evidently exhausted, who could no more than stumble along and who blocked the trail. This, and one other, were the only played-out men they encountered, for they were very near {{to the head of}} the stampede. Nor did they learn till afterwards the horrors of that night. Exhausted men sat down to rest by the way and failed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> Seven were frozen to death, while scores of amputations of toes, feet, and fingers were performed in the Dawson hospitals on the survivors. For the stampede to Squaw Creek occurred on the coldest night of the year. Before morning, the spirit thermometers at Dawson registered seventy degrees below zero. The men composing the stampede, with few exceptions, were new-comers in the country who did not know the way of the cold.|$|E
60|$|Rollo, {{though at}} first very much {{astonished}} at this {{performance of the}} conductor, afterwards ceased to wonder at it; for {{he found that the}} conductor could ascend and descend to and from his seat at any time without any difficulty, even while the horses were going {{at the top of their}} speed. If the snapper of the coachman's whip got caught in the harness so that he could not liberate it, as it often did on the road, the conductor would climb down, run forward to the horses, set the snapper free, fall back to the coach, catch hold of the side and climb up, the coachman cracking his whip as soon as it was freed, and urging on his horses to a gallop, without troubling himself at all to consider how the conductor was <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|So Mac {{resigned}} himself, and Rose waited dutifully till dinner-time {{assured her}} that her waiting was in vain. She had done her best to keep warm, had skated till she was tired and hot, then stood watching others till she was chilled; tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> a glow <b>again</b> by trotting <b>up</b> and down the road, but failed to do so, and finally cuddled disconsolately under a pine-tree to wait and watch. When she at length started for home, she was benumbed with cold, and could hardly make her way against the wind that buffeted the frost-bitten rose most unmercifully.|$|R
6000|$|Forester {{then called}} upon {{each of the}} boys, in succession, to give his opinion on the point. Marco {{was in favor of}} going down the river, but all the rest, though they said that they should like to go very much, thought it would not answer, as it would be almost {{impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the boat <b>up</b> <b>again</b> over the rips. After the consultation was concluded, Forester said, [...] "Well, boys, you have all given wise opinions except Marco, and his is not wise. Now we'll go aboard the boat." ...|$|R
6000|$|These wretches howled as if {{they had}} all gone mad. Yet there was [...] "method in their madness," [...] for they congregated in a crowd before beginning, and sat down on their haunches. Then one, which seemed to be the conductor, raised his snout to the sky, and uttered a long, low, melancholy wail. The others took it up by twos and threes, until the whole pack had their noses {{pointing}} to the stars, and their throats distended to the uttermost, while a prolonged yell filled the air. Then it sank gradually, one or two (bad performers probably) making a yelping attempt <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it <b>up</b> <b>again</b> at the wrong time. Again the conductor raised his nose, and out it came--full swing. There was no vociferous barking. It was simple wolfish howling increased in fervour to an electric yell, with slight barks running continuously through it like an obbligato accompaniment.|$|R
