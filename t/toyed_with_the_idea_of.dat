5|$|Since 1993, Curtis had {{frequently}} read {{morning news}} stories and exchanged them with friends.

5|$|Cosima was 24 {{years younger}} than Wagner and was herself illegitimate, the {{daughter}} of the Countess Marie d'Agoult, who had left her husband for Franz Liszt. Liszt initially disapproved of his daughter's involvement with Wagner, though nevertheless the two men were friends. The indiscreet affair scandalised Munich, and Wagner also fell into disfavour with many leading members of the court, who were suspicious of his influence on the King. In December 1865, Ludwig was finally forced to ask the composer to leave Munich. He apparently also <b>toyed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> abdicating to follow his hero into exile, but Wagner quickly dissuaded him.|$|E

He <b>toyed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> fleeing to Germany and taking his pupils with him. While Knox {{remained}} a fugitive, Beaton was murdered on 29 May 1546, within his residence, the Castle of St Andrews, by a gang of five persons in revenge for Wishart's execution. The assassins seized the castle and eventually their families and friends took refuge with them, about a hundred and fifty men in all. Among their friends was Henry Balnaves, a former secretary of state in the government, who negotiated with England for the financial support of the rebels.
