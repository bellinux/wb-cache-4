5|$|Maben was {{concerned}} {{that one of the}} problems with the film was that it was too short. In early 1973, Maben was fly fishing with Waters, and suggested the possibility of improving the film by watching them at work in a recording studio. Subsequently, Maben was invited with a small crew using a single 35mm camera to Abbey Road Studios to film supposed recording sessions of The Dark Side of the Moon, as well as interviews conducted off-camera by Maben, and footage of the band eating and <b>talking</b> <b>at</b> the studio cafeteria. Maben was particularly happy about this footage, feeling it captured the spontaneous humour of the band. This version premiered on 21 August 1974, and ran for 80 minutes.|$|E

25|$|JR and Babe lead {{separate}} {{lives for}} a while. However, on November 2, 2007, as they later bond over old times while <b>talking</b> <b>at</b> the bar The Comeback, their connection draws them together once more. Babe sees a more mature side to JR, {{and after she}} offers him a ride home, the two cannot stop the pull that is apparent between them. With the sexual tension intensifying, and JR saying that he misses kissing her, the two make love {{for the first time}} since their divorce. Despite this reunion of sorts, Babe tells JR that it was just a one-time deal and says that she is not in love with him anymore. JR is left devastated, and even after Babe apologizes for hurting him in this way, he sulks in despair and begins drinking again.|$|E

Batman finds evidence linking Carl Beaumont with Sol, Bronski and a third gangster: Salvatore Valestra.

When he visits Andrea to try to get more answers she rebuffs him, intimating that she knows his identity. Meanwhile, Valestra believes Batman killed the others and will come for him, so he turns to the Joker for help.|$|E

500|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. Homer's physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no characters other than Homer, Grampa Simpson, Lenny, and Krusty the Clown have a similar beard line. When Groening originally designed Homer, he put his initials into the character's hairline and ear: the hairline resembled an 'M', and the right ear resembled a 'G'. Groening decided that this would be too distracting and redesigned the ear to look normal. However, he still draws the ear as a 'G' when he draws pictures of Homer for fans. The basic shape of Homer's head is described by director Mark Kirkland as a tube-shaped coffee can with a salad bowl on top. Bart's head is also coffee-can shaped, while spheres are used for Marge, Lisa, and Maggie. During the shorts, the animators experimented with the way Homer would move his mouth when <b>talking.</b> <b>At</b> one point, his mouth would stretch out back [...] "beyond his beardline"; but this was dropped when it got [...] "out of control." [...] In some early episodes, Homer's hair was rounded rather than sharply pointed because animation director Wes Archer felt it should look disheveled. Homer's hair evolved to be consistently pointed. During the first three seasons, Homer's design for some close-up shots included small lines which were meant to be eyebrows. Matt Groening strongly disliked them and they were eventually dropped.|$|E
2500|$|Huxley {{was born}} on 22 June 1887, at the London house of his aunt, the novelist Mary Augusta Ward, while his father was {{attending}} the jubilee celebrations of Queen Victoria. Huxley grew up at the family home in Surrey, England, where he showed an early interest in nature, as he was given lessons by his grandfather, Thomas Henry Huxley. When he heard his grandfather <b>talking</b> <b>at</b> dinner {{about the lack of}} parental care in fish, Julian piped up with [...] "What about the stickleback, Gran'pater?" [...] Also, according to Julian himself, his grandfather took him to visit J. D. Hooker at Kew.|$|E

[...] He added: [...] "We must never again turn our disagreements into a crisis." [...] Chirac reportedly said in private that Sarkozy's speech was [...] "appalling" [...] and [...] "a shameful act".|$|E

2500|$|Sandford {{believed}} the Epistle of James compelled Christians who were sick to call church elders for prayer and the laying on of hands. [...] Sandford criticized Christians who sought treatment from physicians. He believed that illness {{might be the}} result of either discipline from God or an attack of Satan; but casting out demons required “prevailing prayer,” an exercise that included such protracted fervency and shouting that one skeptic became apprehensive as what sounded “like a hundred people <b>talking</b> <b>at</b> once” concluded with a woman’s screams piercing the din. In 1899, Sandford received a divine message to complete a hospital in a hasty building drive—a technique frequently employed at Shiloh—but it was a hospital in which doctors were permitted only for diagnoses and consultations. [...] No medicines of any kind were provided. Among those influenced by these early religious developments at Shiloh were A. J. Tomlinson, founder of the Church of God, and Charles Fox Parham, {{one of the founders of}} the Pentecostal movement.|$|E
2500|$|With Trilogy now on iTunes and in-stores, The Weeknd {{turned to}} his fifth {{official}} video, one of his three new releases from his debut, [...] "Twenty Eight". Dropped on 13 February 2013 and directed by up-and-coming visionary Nabil Elderkin (some may notice similarities to Frank Ocean's [...] "Pyramids" [...] video which he also directed). Simren Bolaria of music blog Earmilk, describes the video, [...] "A long way from his former faceless, anti-media Internet persona, a distracted Abel Tesfaye sits down for a grey and dreary television interview with a foreign journalist while a haunting hologram girl sits in bed watching from her own television set. He's under surveillance—the crew is watching, hologram girl is watching, and the reporter is <b>talking</b> <b>at</b> him, so he dips into mental absence. The Weeknd continues to slip back into his alternate stripper world where the lights are flashing, the strippers don't get tired, the décor is decadent, and he can do the watching himself, with a camcorder in hand, of course. The line between what's real and what's imagined is blurred, {{but one thing is}} clear—this video is definitely NSFW." ...|$|E

2500|$|January 1927 began {{similarly}} {{at the new}} Center, and in February, {{though there}} was then a gap until April. In May Ford was on radio station WGL (later bought by WADO) and she was cut off the air while speaking to a banquet audience of the All Nations Association, an international peace organization, in praise of Amelia Gade Corson because the manager declared it a pacifist talk, which, according to him, [...] "was not {{in line for the}} occasion". The news of the action was carried by Associated Press and the story printed variously in the United States. It was one of several incidents with that station. Ford later released a statement:The All Nations association for which i was speaking feels Denmark represents the ideal for which it is working, having created peace through disarmament, I said that as Mrs. Corson, a native of Denmark, had married an American, better feeling would be created between the two countries because of the fame of this woman." [...] Congressman Emanuel Celler added the incident to his list of censorship of liberal views published in June. In September Ford herself was in London and Rome. But by October she was noted in New York <b>talking</b> <b>at</b> a race amity meeting.|$|E
