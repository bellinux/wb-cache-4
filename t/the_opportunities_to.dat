5|$|Sinclair {{took up the}} {{environmental}} cause of her birthplace, the Lord Howe Island, in 1982, when it was listed as an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Though the islanders were pleased with the heritage status accorded to the island, Sinclair was unhappy {{with many of the}} planning and management actions initiated by the Government of Australia to conserve the newly accorded heritage status, as it affected the basic rights of the islanders. Her objections were to the cutting of pine trees planted in the 19th century; she considered these trees (though not indigenous) as part of the island's heritage. When the trees were being felled she threatened to lie down between the trees to stop the tree cutters. Her argument was that the trees added to the aesthetic beauty of the island. She also objected to the neglect of maintenance of embankments that were built to extend the airport on the island, as the embankments were eroding. She objected to the garbage that was being dumped in the lagoon of the island as it was causing health hazards. The management plan proposed by the government to preserve the island's heritage status envisaged restricting the tourist accommodation to about 400 and limiting the number of cars on the island to 100, which she objected for the reason that it was limiting <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> the islanders who had lived there for many years. Another of her protests was on the creation of an aquatic reserve {{in a part of the}} island. She considered this action as detrimental to the fishing rights of the local people who had fished in the area for several years. All her objections resulted in the Ministry of Planning and Environment agreeing to address the issues she had raised. In 1967, she worked in the Prime Minister's Department and dealt with public relations and facilitated the Montreal Expo.|$|E

A {{dominant}} feature of political life during that period were the attempts of Congress to assert oversight of the U.S. Presidency and the executive branch of the U.S. government.

However, it was widely rumored that it was not Shusai but one of his students - Maeda Nobuaki - who authored this ingenious move. Even Maeda himself hinted that this move was indeed his idea. Years later, when presented with <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> debunk this rumor, he neither confirmed nor denied it. The game became known as the game of the century.|$|E

25|$|Female headed {{households}} are most susceptible to poverty {{because they have}} fewer income earners to provide financial support within the household. According to {{a case study in}} Zimbabwe, households headed by widows have an income of approximately half that of male-headed households, and de facto female headed households have about three quarters of the income of male headed households. Additionally, single mother households lack critical resources in life, which worsens their state of poverty. They {{do not have access to}} <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> attain a decent standard of living along with basic needs such as health and education. Single mother households relate to gender inequality issues as women are more susceptible to poverty and lack essential life needs in comparison to men.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 11th century {{centralized}} authority based at Cordoba broke down following the Berber invasion and the ousting of the Umayyads. In its stead arose the independent taifa principalities {{under the rule}} of local Muladi, Arab, Berber, or Slavonic leaders. Rather than having a stifling effect, the disintegration of the caliphate expanded <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> Jewish and other professionals. The services of Jewish scientists, doctors, traders, poets, and scholars were generally valued by Christian and Muslim rulers of regional centers, especially as order was restored in recently conquered towns. Rabbi Samuel ha-Nagid (ibn Naghrela) was the Vizier of Granada. He was succeeded by his son Joseph ibn Naghrela who was slain by an incited mob along with most of the Jewish community. The remnant fled to Lucena.|$|E
25|$|A further {{advantage}} of PHEVs {{is that they}} have potential to be even more efficient than conventional hybrids because a more limited use of the PHEV's internal combustion engine may allow the engine to be used at closer to its maximum efficiency. While a Prius is likely to convert fuel to motive energy on average at about 30% efficiency (well below the engine's 38% peak efficiency) the engine of a PHEV-70 would be likely to operate far more often near its peak efficiency because the batteries can serve the modest power needs at times when the combustion engine would be forced to run well below its peak efficiency. The actual efficiency achieved depends on losses from electricity generation, inversion, battery charging/discharging, the motor controller and motor itself, the way a vehicle is used (its duty cycle), and <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> recharge by connecting to the electrical grid.|$|E

25|$|The {{authorization}} {{system was}} against Article 21 {{of the constitution}} that guarantees {{the freedom of speech}} and expression. Writing and publication of history textbook is a form of speech that is protected by the Constitution; however, the system of school textbook authorization as it was practiced in 1965 conducted thought control and prohibited publication and use of textbooks at schools that were deemed inappropriate according to a particular political ideology held by the government. According to Ienaga this falls under the category of censorship (検閲) that is prohibited by Section 2, Article 21 of the Constitution of Japan. Article 21 specifically prohibits censorship in an independent section because it is the principle of the democratic constitution of Japan that the people are guaranteed <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> freely enjoy the results of scholastic researches, be exposed to all sorts of ideas and opinions, and know socio-political reality and historical truth through various media such as press, radio, and television.|$|E

500|$|To {{test for}} this theory, {{they gave the}} same test while varying the time between <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> choose a reward. They found that as the {{interval}} increased, {{the number of times}} that the monkeys chose the more risky reward decreased. While this occurred in macaque monkeys, the varying interval time did not affect pigeons' choices in another study. This suggests that research looking into varying risk sensitivity of different species is needed. [...] When provided a choice between a small, short delay reward, and a large, long delay reward, there is an impulsive preference for the former. Additionally, as the delay time for the small/short and large/long reward increases, there is a shift in preference toward the larger, delayed reward. This evidence only supports hyperbolic discounting, not exponential.|$|E
500|$|Episode writer Lender {{proposed}} to have Count Orlok of the 1922 silent film Nosferatu {{appear as a}} gag {{at the end of}} the episode.

[...] Lender then searched for books with scannable pictures of Count Orlok. However, the image of Count Orlok used in the episode was taken from the Internet. He said, [...] "I searched what little there was of the Web back then." [...] Nick Jennings Photoshopped the smile on Count Orlok to make sure it matched Lender's board drawing. Lender said, [...] "It was my baby, and I held its hand until we shipped it overseas [...]" [...] Before his idea of Count Orlok, Lender thought of [...] "Floorboard Harry", a deleted gag that concludes the broadcast episode, in which he initially flickers the lights.|$|E

500|$|He {{then moved}} on to {{addressing}} the freedom of the press, and the limits on it, arguing that freedom of speech was necessary to identify the flaws {{in the structure of the}} government and the constitution—even if the author was mistaken about those flaws. As long as a writer intended only to enlighten others, prohibiting their speech would serve only to undermine the government by harming <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> improve it. While Macdonald had argued that the book was problematic because it was circulated amongst all classes of society, Erskine argued that this was not the test of whether the Rights of Man was seditious. Instead, the test was whether Paine had exclusively dealt with what he believed to be in the best interests of England, its government, and its people. While Paine's opinions ran counter to the existing system of government, Erskine argued that [...] "opinion is free and ... conduct alone is amenable to the law". For a libel claim to succeed, the Libel Act 1792 required that the prosecution show the publication was motivated by malice; as Paine had intended only to help mankind, and this was a pure motive, he could not be guilty.|$|E
