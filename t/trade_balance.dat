40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present differences in Poland’s bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> in gross terms and in value added terms in 1995 - 2011, as well as an explanation of such differences. Research Design & Methods: It was decided to explain why Poland’s bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> in gross terms and value added terms differ. The calculations were made using the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), based on the input-output approach. Findings: In the years 1995 - 2011, Poland’s trade with the majority of the countries was characterised by widening gaps between balances in gross terms and those in VA terms. The decomposition of bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> by VA content demonstrated that the differences in the value of <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> in gross terms and in VA terms had been mostly determined by two components: ‘multilateral VA net exports to third countries via partner’ and ‘foreign VA in net exports from other countries than partner’. Implications & Recommendations: To appraise benefits from Poland’s bilateral trade better it is recommended to use the decomposition of <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> by value added content. Contribution & Value Added: The originality of this work lies in the decomposition of Poland’s bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> by value added content. Such a decomposition allows to identify factors driving Poland’s bilateral net exports...|$|R

The advantages granted by the investment laws he established in 1959 allowed foreign business to repatriate up to 90% of their profits in their country of origin (the remaining 10% was reinvested in Côte d'Ivoire). He also developed an agenda for modernising the country's infrastructure, for example, building an American-style business district in Abidjan where five-star hotels and resorts welcomed tourists and businessmen. Côte d'Ivoire experienced economic growth of 11–12% from 1960 to 1965. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew twelvefold between 1960 and 1978, from 145 to 1,750billion CFA francs, while the <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> continued to record a surplus.|$|E

By 1914, about 15% the Argentine labour force was involved in manufacturing, compared to 20% involved in commercial activities. In 1913, the country's income per head was on a par with that of France and Germany, and far ahead of Italy's or Spain's. At the end of 1913, Argentina had a gold stock of £59 million, or 3.7% of the world's monetary gold, while representing 1.2% of the world's economic output.|$|E

The {{balance of payments}} {{is a function of}} three components: transactions involving export or import of goods and services form the current account, transactions involving purchase or sale of financial assets form the financial account, and transactions involving unconventional transfers of wealth form the capital account. The current account summarizes three variables: the <b>trade</b> <b>balance,</b> net factor income from abroad, and net unilateral transfers. The financial account summarizes the value of exports versus imports of assets, and the capital account summarizes the value of asset transfers received net of transfers given. The capital account also includes the official reserve account, which summarizes central banks' purchases and sales of domestic currency, foreign exchange, gold, and SDRs for purposes of maintaining or utilizing bank reserves.|$|E

The paper presents an attempt to empirically verify theory {{that could be used}} for explaining Poland’s foreign trade imbalance. The main hypothesis combines the macroeconomic imbalance with bilateral trade imbalance. The main assumption is that bilateral trade imbalances result from the aggregate trade imbalance. It is somehow natural for countries with permanent deficits in foreign trade to experience bilateral deficits in trade with countries experiencing permanent surpluses. For the studied case of Poland, this theory allows for forecasting <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> on the basis of aggregate macroeconomic imbalance. Empirical study for the period from 1993 to 2006 shows that there are no reasons to reject the posed hypothesis. However, for forecasting bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> the theory is insufficient due to significant asymmetry...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} the growing {{intermediate}} goods trade, the WTO, the OECD, and the United Nations have {{emphasized the importance of}} a new concept of trade in value-added (TiVA) in place of traditional gross trade.

First, based on global and local equilibrium conditions of a global input–output model, we prove the fundamental theorem on the relationship between gross <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> in value-added and gross terms: the total sum of a country’s (country r) <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> with many countries (countries 1, 2,…, s, …, R; s ≠ r) in value-added equals that in gross terms, namely, the total sum of differentials between country r’s <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> with country s in value-added and gross terms equals zero:...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{increases}} {{in food and}} other commodity prices have highlighted concerns that many poor countries are net food importers and higher food prices would worsen their <b>trade</b> <b>balances.</b> In this article, we analyze the changes in food <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> associated with the 32 % increase in food prices from 2000 / 2001 to 2004 / 2005. We find a small deterioration in food <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> of low-income countries and an improvement in middle-income countries. The deterioration is most severe for countries in conflict and small island states, so attention should be placed first on these countries and on a few very-low-income countries that are also vulnerable. Because low-income countries as a group had much lower agricultural GDP growth rates than middle-income countries, the answers to food vulnerability in low-income countries should probably be addressed {{within the context of}} incentives for agricultural production.

40|$|One of {{the main}} stylised facts that has emerged from the recent {{literature}} on global value chains is that bilateral trade imbalances in gross terms can differ substantially from those measured in value added terms.

Here, we propose a novel decomposition of bilateral gross <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> that accounts for the differences between gross and value added concepts. The bilateral analysis contributes conceptually to the literature on double counting in trade by identifying the trade flow in which value added is actually recorded for the first time in international trade statistics. We apply our decomposition framework to the development of intra-EU 27 <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> from 1995 - 2011 and show that a growing share of intra-EU bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> is due to demand in countries other than the two direct trading partners...|$|R

Furthermore, it adopted renewed strategies of import substitution industrialization and of economic diversification. In the mid-1970s, the regime began implementing a development plan aimed at increasing self-sufficiency in many sectors and creating new comparative advantages. Its main components were to promote import substitution of basic industrial inputs (steel, aluminium, fertilizers, petrochemicals), to make large investments in the expansion of the economic infrastructure, and to promote exports.|$|E
