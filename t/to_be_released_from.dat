5|$|At {{the final}} {{meeting of the}} World Motorsports Commission in December 2011, a series of {{amendments}} to the sporting regulations were published. Chief among these is the re-introduction of a rule that will allow all lapped traffic under the safety car (which remained the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG introduced in 2010) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> the queue before the car returns to pit lane, allowing the drivers to unlap themselves and to ensure a clean restart.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, WWE {{confirmed}} {{they had}} sent Hardy {{home from a}} European tour. Following this, Hardy began posting videos on his YouTube channel expressing his disinterest in the WWE product and insisting that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> the company. On October 15, 2010, WWE announced that Hardy had been released from his contract. Hardy later stated that his release had been in effect two weeks before WWE made the announcement.|$|E
5|$|Townshend {{spent part}} of 1983 writing {{material}} for a Who studio album owed to Warner Bros. Records from a contract in 1980, but he found himself unable to generate music appropriate for the Who {{and at the end}} of 1983 paid for himself and Jones <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> the contract. On 16 December 1983, Townshend announced at a press conference that he was leaving the Who, effectively ending the band.|$|E

5|$|Wynnea {{americana}} {{is distinguished}} from other {{species in the}} genus Wynnea by the pustules (small bumps) on the outer surface, and microscopically by the large asymmetrical longitudinally ribbed spores with a sharply pointed tip. The spores are made in structures called asci, which have thickened rings at one end that are capped by a hinged structure known as the operculum—a lid that is opened when spores are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> the ascus.|$|E
5|$|By December 1942 {{there were}} {{concerns}} that even Oak Ridge {{was too close}} to a major population center (Knoxville) in the unlikely event of a major nuclear accident. Groves recruited DuPont in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a standard cost plus fixed-fee contract, but the President of the company, Walter S. Carpenter, Jr., wanted no profit of any kind, and asked for the proposed contract to be amended to explicitly exclude the company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons a nominal fee of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont asked <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.|$|E
5|$|During this {{conflict}} and others during the 1880s, Carte and Helen Lenoir frequently worked to smooth over the partners' differences using {{a mixture of}} friendship and business acumen. Sullivan asked <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> the partnership on several occasions. Nevertheless, Carte was able to coax eight comic operas out of his partners in the 1880s. When Princess Ida closed after a comparatively short run of nine months, {{for the first time}} in the partnership's history, the next opera was not ready. Gilbert first suggested a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge – a scenario that Sullivan had previously rejected. Gilbert eventually came up with a new idea and began work in May 1884.|$|E

5|$|Lesnar had {{previously}} signed a non-compete clause in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> {{his contract with}} WWE, which prohibited him from working for any other professional wrestling companies before June 2010. However, he decided to challenge this ruling in court. WWE responded with a counterclaim after Lesnar breached the agreement by appearing at a New Japan Pro-Wrestling show in 2004. In July 2005, the two sides dropped their claims and entered negotiations to renew their relationship. WWE had offered Lesnar a contract, but on August 2, their official website reported that Lesnar had withdrawn from any involvement with the company. The lawsuit began to enter settlement talks on September 21, but did not get solved.|$|E
5|$|Menem met Admiral Eduardo Massera, who {{intended}} {{to run for}} president, and had public meetings with personalities such as Carlos Monzón, Susana Giménez, and Alberto Olmedo. As a result, {{he was forced to}} reside in another city, Tandil. He had to report daily to Chief of Police Hugo Zamora. This forced residence was lifted in February 1980. He returned to Buenos Aires, and then to La Rioja. He resumed his political activities, despite the prohibition, and was detained again. His new forced residence was in Las Lomitas, in Formosa Province. He {{was one of the last}} politicians <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> prison by the National Reorganization Process.|$|E
5|$|Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect {{continued}} their feud, although Flair legitimately requested <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> his WWF contract {{in order to}} return to World Championship Wrestling (WCW). His request was granted {{on the condition that}} he help build up Perfect as a credible babyface. The two men attacked each other during the battle royal at Royal Rumble 1993, and Perfect eliminated Flair from the match. The following night, Perfect defeated Flair in a loser leaves town match. Flair did not return to the WWF until McMahon purchased WCW in 2001.|$|E

5|$|When in 2002 {{another life}} {{sentence}} prisoner challenged the Home Secretary's power to set minimum terms, Hindley {{and hundreds of}} others, whose tariffs had been increased by politicians, looked likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> prison. Hindley's release seemed imminent and plans were made by supporters {{for her to be}} given a new identity. Home Secretary David Blunkett ordered Greater Manchester Police to find new charges against her, to prevent her release from prison. The investigation was headed by Superintendent Tony Brett, and initially looked at charging Hindley with the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, but the advice given by government lawyers was that because of the DPP's decision taken 15 years earlier, a new trial would probably be considered an abuse of process.|$|E
5|$|In 1646–47, Ashmole {{made several}} {{simultaneous}} approaches to rich widows {{in the hope}} of securing a good marriage. In 1649, he married Mary, Lady Mainwaring (daughter of Sir William Forster of Aldermaston), a wealthy thrice-widowed woman twenty years his senior; she may have been a relative by marriage of his first wife's family and was the mother of grown children. The marriage took place despite the opposition of the bride's family, and it did not prove to be harmonious: Lady Mainwaring filed suit for separation and alimony but it was dismissed by the courts in 1657. Nevertheless, the marriage provided Ashmole with Mary's first husband's estates centred on Bradfield in Berkshire which left him wealthy enough to pursue his interests, including botany and alchemy, without concern for having to earn a living. He arranged for his friend Wharton <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> prison and appointed him to manage the estates.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} when Æthelberht became a Christian. It is possible, despite Bede's account, that he already was a Christian before Augustine's mission arrived. It is likely that Liudhard and Bertha pressed Æthelberht to {{consider}} becoming a Christian {{before the arrival of}} the mission, and it is also likely that a condition of Æthelberht's marriage to Bertha was that Æthelberht would consider conversion. Conversion via the influence of the Frankish court would have been seen as an explicit recognition of Frankish overlordship, however, so it is possible that Æthelberht's delay of his conversion until it could be accomplished via Roman influence, might have been an assertion of independence from Frankish control. It also has been argued that Augustine's hesitation—he turned back to Rome, asking <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> the mission—is an indication that Æthelberht was a pagan at the time Augustine was sent.|$|E

5|$|On the November 13 {{episode of}} Impact!, Cage {{was to be}} {{inducted}} into The Main Event Mafia (MEM), however, they instead turned on and assaulted him. This led to Cage's occasional tag team partner, Rhino, becoming involved in the overall storyline {{as the leader of}} the group The TNA Front Line after he was attacked by MEM on the November 20 episode of Impact!. During that same telecast, Angle versus Rhino was announced as TNA's Final Resolution event, with the added stipulations that if Angle won he would gain an opportunity to face Jeff Jarrett, while if Rhino won, then Angle was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> his TNA contract. Angle went on to defeat Rhino at the event, which led to Angle defeating Jarrett in a No Disqualification match at TNA's Genesis event in January 2009.|$|E
5|$|Prison officials, {{fed up with}} Stroud's {{activities}} and their attendant publicity, intensified their efforts to transfer him out of Leavenworth. Stroud, however, discovered a Kansas law that forbade the transfer of prisoners married in Kansas. To this end, he married Jones by proxy, which infuriated the prison's administrators, who would not allow him to correspond with his wife. Prison officials {{were not the only}} ones perturbed with Stroud's marriage; his mother was also incensed. They had a close relationship, but Elizabeth Stroud strongly disapproved of the marriage to Jones, believing women were nothing but trouble for her son. Whereas previously she had been a strong advocate for her son, helping him with legal battles, she now argued against his application for parole, and became a major obstacle in his attempts <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> the prison system. She moved away from Leavenworth and refused any further contact with him until her death in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Raven and NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zybysko were {{involved}} in a rivalry heading into Final Resolution. At Bound for Glory, Raven requested an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match but was denied by Zybysko. This led to Raven assaulting him before being ejected from the arena by security in the storyline. At Genesis, Zybysko offered Raven the chance <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> his contract, as this was what Zybysko wanted in the storyline. Raven declined the offer and tried to attack Zybysko once again. Instead, Zybysko forced Raven to face P.J. Polaco in a match, which Raven won. This led to Turning Point where Raven once again declined an offer to be released. Zybysko then revealed Chris K as Raven's opponent for the night; Raven was victorious in the encounter. On the December17, 2005 episode of Impact!, Zybysko announced that at Final Resolution Raven would have another opponent and if he won the bout then he gained a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match.|$|E

5000|$|According <b>to</b> , Jeconiah <b>was</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> prison [...] "in the 37th {{year of the}} exile", in {{the year}} that Amel-Marduk (Evil-Merodach) came to the throne. Babylonian records show that Amel-Marduk began his reign in October 562 BC. According <b>to</b> , Jeconiah <b>was</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> prison [...] "on the 27th day of the twelfth month." [...] This {{indicates}} {{the first year of}} captivity <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 598/597 BC, according to Judah's Tishri-based calendar. The 37th year of captivity was thus, by Judean reckoning, the year that began in Tishri of 562, consistent with the synchronism to the accession year of Amel-Marduk given in Babylonian records.|$|R
5|$|The {{contacts}} of Thomas Goodman enabled Erasmus {{to serve}} a seven-year apprenticeship in London with a poultry merchant, John Saunders, and he was made a freeman of the Grocers' Company on 10 February 1635. By 1631 Roger Smith had become an alderman of the City of London and in 1635 he was knighted; Erasmus followed in his father's footsteps, being elected an alderman in 1657, but preferred to pay a fine of £420 in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> the duties of office. In these early years he was also unwilling to have much involvement {{in the business of}} the Grocers' Company, although this changed later in life: the cause of his initial reluctance may have been his preference to concentrate on acquiring his wealth. According to the records of the Aldermen of the City of London, Erasmus was Member of Parliament for Ardee in County Louth between 1665 and 1666.|$|E
5|$|While at Paramount, in 1955, he {{produced}} the highly commercially successful Strategic Air Command, starring James Stewart. After {{the success of}} Strategic Air Command, Paramount obtained the rights to The Sons of Katie Elder, and assigned the project to Briskin to produce, with Alan Ladd starring. However, when Ladd brought out {{the remainder of his}} contract with Paramount, the film was put on hold, and would not be produced until 1965, by a different producer, Hal B. Wallis. In May 1956, Briskin asked <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> the final two years of his agreement with Paramount, to which the studio agreed. The one condition was that Briskin finish work on his remaining film commitment to the studio, The Joker is Wild, starring Frank Sinatra, which was being produced by an independent film company, A.M.B.L. Productions, under an agreement with Paramount.|$|E
5|$|At 09:35 September 2, {{while the}} North Koreans were {{attempting}} to destroy the engineer troops at {{the southern edge of}} Yongsan and clear the road to Miryang, Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker spoke by telephone with Major General Doyle O. Hickey, Deputy Chief of Staff, Far East Command in Tokyo. He described the situation around the Perimeter and said the most serious threat was along the boundary between the US 2nd and US 25th Infantry Divisions. He described the location of his reserve forces and his plans for using them. He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, under Brigadier General Edward A. Craig, toward Yongsan but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use of them, since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the Far East Command. Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them. Hickey replied that MacArthur had the day before approved the use of the US Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary. A few hours after this conversation, at 13:15, Walker attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the US 2nd Division and ordered a co-ordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the marines, with the mission of destroying the North Koreans east of the Naktong River in the 2nd Division sector and restoring the river line. The marines were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>released</b> <b>from</b> 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished.|$|E
