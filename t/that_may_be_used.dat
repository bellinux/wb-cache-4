5|$|The International System of Units (abbreviated as SI, {{from the}} French Système {{international}} (d'unités)) is the modern {{form of the}} metric system, and is {{the most widely used}} system of measurement. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units and a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system also specifies lowercase names for 22 derived units.|$|E
5|$|The Sonoran Arthropod Institute hosts {{an annual}} Invertebrates in Education and Conservation Conference {{to discuss the}} use of {{invertebrates}} in education. There also are efforts in many countries to find alternatives to using animals in education. The NORINA database, maintained by Norecopa, lists products <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as alternatives or supplements to animal use in education, and in the training of personnel who work with animals. These include alternatives to dissection in schools. InterNICHE has a similar database and a loans system.|$|E

5|$|Burns and Rigby {{found several}} prototiles, {{including}} the Koch snowflake, <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to tile the plane only by using {{copies of the}} prototile in two or more different sizes. An earlier paper by Danzer, Grünbaum, and Shephard provides another example, a convex pentagon that tiles the plane only when combined in two sizes. Although the Pythagorean tiling uses two different sizes of squares, the square {{does not have the}} same property as these prototiles of only tiling by similarity, because it also is possible to tile the plane using only squares of a single size.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{pigeons and doves}} are used as food; however, all types are edible. The {{powerful}} breast muscles characteristic of the family make excellent meat. Domesticated or hunted pigeons {{have been used as}} the source of food since the times of the Ancient Middle East, Ancient Rome, and Medieval Europe. It is familiar meat within Jewish, Arab, Assamese and French cuisines. According to the Tanakh, doves are kosher, and they are the only birds <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for a korban. Other kosher birds may be eaten, but not brought as a korban. It is also known in Asian cuisines, such as Chinese and Indonesian.|$|E
5|$|The asci are 400–500 by 12–14µm, cylindrical, and operculate. The ascospores are {{elliptical}} to cylindrical with rounded ends, uniseriate, hyaline, {{and measure}} 26–40 by 10–12µm. They contain two large oil drops at either end; the oil drops are useful taxonomic characters <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to help distinguish S.dudleyi {{from some other}} Sarcoscypha species. The spores are covered with a sheath of mucilage, which typically causes the eight spores of the ascus to be ejected together. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphal end cells in the hymenium) are slender, slightly enlarged above, and contain numerous red granules. The granules contain carotenoid pigments such as plectaniaxanthine or beta carotene, and give the fruit body its color.|$|E

5|$|The game {{implements}} {{an inventory}} system to allow Sam to store any items that the player picks {{up during the}} course of the game. The player may select any of the items in the inventory and can then attempt to use them on objects in the game world or give them to other characters simply by clicking on the desired target. Unlike Save the Worlds predecessor, Sam & Max Hit the Road, inventory items are context specific, and cannot be used together or combined to create new items. Typically, Sam carries a gun <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to solve several puzzles.|$|E
5|$|The game's 15 {{missions}} {{take place}} in large levels that can be confronted in multiple ways. Guards may be knocked out with a blackjack or killed with a bow or sword, and their fallen bodies may be picked up and hidden. In addition to human enemies, the game features security automatons and surveillance cameras. While completing objectives such as frameups and blackmail, the player steals valuables <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to purchase thieving gear between missions. The player's main tools are specialized arrows, including water arrows to douse lights, moss arrows to dampen the player character's footsteps and rope arrows to reach higher ground.|$|E
5|$|The story mode {{is split}} into several chapters. As the {{narrative}} plays out, the player swaps between different characters. Minigames are also {{incorporated into the}} story. The outcome of minigames can impact an upcoming battle, such as giving the player a health advantage over the CPU opponent. Additional game features include Battle Mode, Versus Mode, Training Mode, and S.T.A.R. Labs, which includes 240 character-specific challenges of varying difficulty. Online multiplayer modes include King of the Hill, a setup that allows up to eight players to spectate a match while waiting for their turn to fight, and Survivor, which carries over the current winner's health bar and character selection over each match. Playing through any of the game modes, including online matches with optional goal objectives, will net the player experience points <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to unlock alternate costumes, music, concept art, and other rewards.|$|E

5|$|Topical {{antibiotics}} deemed safe {{during pregnancy}} include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other topical antibiotics <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study. No adverse fetal events {{have been reported}} from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used {{there is a high}} risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.|$|E
