50|$|The Industrial {{portion of}} the name is largely historical, {{as many of the}} modern 30 {{components}} have little or nothing to do with traditional heavy industry. The average is price-weighted, and to compensate for the effects of stock splits and other adjustments, it is currently a scaled average. The value of <b>the</b> <b>Dow</b> <b>is</b> not the actual average of the prices of its component stocks, but rather the sum of the component prices divided by a divisor, which changes whenever one of the component stocks has a stock split or stock dividend, so as to generate a consistent value for the index. Since the divisor is currently less than one, the value of the index is larger than the sum of the component prices. Although <b>the</b> <b>Dow</b> <b>is</b> compiled to gauge the performance of the industrial sector within the American economy, the index's performance continues to be influenced by not only corporate and economic reports, but also by domestic and foreign political events such as war and terrorism, as well as by natural disasters that could potentially lead to economic harm.|$|E
5000|$|Excerpts {{from the}} book were {{published}} in The Atlantic Monthly in 1999.

[...] For the Dow {{to be closer to}} 10,000 than to 36,000, {{it would have to be}} below 23,000. As things turned out, the index was not even at half that figure ten years after Glassman and Hassett's prediction (the Dow's highest close in January 2010 was 10,725, reached on 19 January). In early 2010, Glassman and Hassett conceded they lost the bet and they each donated $1,000 to the Salvation Army.|$|E

40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the Degree of Bachelor of Business Science in Finance at Strathmore UniversityThis study aims to test the viability of dividend yield investing as an alternative investment strategy to exploit observed overreactions in the• market.

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{implies that}} the Nasdaq is more {{sensitive}} to interest rates than <b>the</b> <b>Dow</b> <b>is</b> due {{to the presence of}} larger firms in the Dow.

The paper uses seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) analysis for the sample period covering January 1990 through May 2000. Both stock indices are equally sensitive for the entire 1990 s {{as well as for the}} latter half of the 90 s. The Nasdaq is more sensitive in the first half of the decade, possibly indicating the emer-gence of an old/new economy dichotomy in the mid- 90 s.

The investment strategy that simple and applicable is often sought by investors to maximize the investors 2 ̆ 7 portfolio. One investment strategy is evolving but still not widely used in Indonesia is an investment strategy based on dividend yield. Dividend yield based investment strategy such as the Dogs of <b>the</b> <b>Dow</b> <b>is</b> quite popular in the United States, but the use of this investment strategy in Indonesia is still quite uncommon. Therefore, the expected investment strategy in Indonesia may provide a favorable outcome. The main issue of writing this final project is whether the application of dividend yield based investment strategy on the Indonesia stock exchange, especially in LQ 45 stock index so that it can produce such good results as on the Dow Jones stock index. The research to analyze the application of dividend yield based investment strategy used historical data of LQ 45 stocks from period 2006 to 2011. Closing prices {{of the end of the}} year and the annual dividend of the companies are the components to calculate dividend yield. The portfolio is formed from the 10 highest dividend yield stocks. The research show that dividend yield based investment strategy can give high performance and also simple to apply. With an investment strategy that provides a profitable portfolio for investors, investment companies may also attract investors to invest in their products. Individual investor could also develop their portfolio using the investment strategy to maximize their profit themselves...|$|E
40|$|Maximizing {{returns are}} most investors’ main concern and {{throughout}} the years plenty of strategies have been developed {{in order to reach}} this goal. What they {{have in common is that}} they claim to outperform the market, which should not be possible considering theories such as the Efficient Market Hypothesis. The Dogs of <b>the</b> <b>Dow</b> <b>is</b> such a strategy and it is built upon the simple idea that you invest in stocks with high dividend-yield. In this study, we will search for evidence that dividend-yield could work as an indicator for what stocks to invest in if you want to maximize your total stock return. The study is conducted on the Stockholm stock market where there is a clear lack of information regarding the dividend-yield and total stock return relationship. We will examine historical data for thirteen years and as such our study is completely quantitative. The purpose is to answer the following research question; “What is the relationship between dividend-yield and total stock return for stocks on the OMX Stockholm Benchmark Index during different trends of the Stockholm stock market during 1999 - 2011 ?” In the processes of answering our research question, we have been conducting statistical tests where the linear regression at the heart. Multicollinearity has been addressed through a Pearson Correlation test. Without considering tax or transaction costs, there was indeed a statistically proven positive relationship between the dividend-yield and the total stock return for the entire period. When examining the sub-periods, which have been divided according to the market trend of the stock market as well as year by year, it is however only possible to ensure the relationship on statistical grounds for some periods. The majority of results indicate a positive relationship between the two variables, even though they might not be statistically proven. Moreover, the relationship did not seem to be linear as zero dividend-yielded stocks had a higher average total stock return compared to the whole sample looking at the entire period. In conclusion, it has been more profitable to follow a strategy that is advocating a portfolio selection of stocks with high compared to low dividend-yield...|$|E
