5|$|On {{the morning}} of October 16, Allen led two rifle {{companies}} (Bravo and Delta) of the 2nd Battalion out from their temporary night defensive position along the Ong Thanh Stream to patrol an area to the southeast, which was covered by thick jungle canopy. After marching for about , the battalion found a fortified Viet Cong bunker, so Allen ordered his men to pull back and directed airstrikes against Viet Cong positions. When the bombing runs were over, Allen’s men entered <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>and</b> a firefight broke out with Viet Cong snipers firing down from trees in the surrounding areas. Again, Allen ordered his men to pull back and form a perimeter to protect their wounded soldiers, as artillery strikes were called in against Viet Cong bunker positions. The 2nd Battalion re-entered <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> <b>and</b> they discovered the bodies of 17 dead Viet Cong soldiers. Allen's men then moved through {{the western end of}} <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> <b>and</b> another fire-fight broke out with an estimated 60 Viet Cong soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The local Partisans {{had been}} advised of the {{presence}} of <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>and</b> the children, probably by Branko Davila, a doctor who had worked at the pre-existing children's home on the camp site. At dawn on 26August 1942, the Partisan 4th Kordun Brigade attacked <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>and</b> dispersed the Ustaše guard force. The children heard the shooting and began shouting that the Partisans had arrived. Despite attempts by the nuns to hide the children, Partisan troops broke into the buildings and rescued many children. Some of the fighters even found a brother or sister within the camp. The Partisans gave what food they had to the children, and led away from the camp all the children that could walk.|$|E

5|$|Although the Persians stood {{their ground}} for a while, they {{eventually}} broke and fled to the palisade. The soldiers of the right wing followed them into the camp, at which point many of the Persian army fled from the camp, except the ethnic Persian troops, who grouped together and fought the Allied soldiers who entered the camp. Finally, the left wing arrived, outflanking <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>and</b> falling on {{the rear of the}} remaining Persian forces, thereby completing the rout.|$|E
5|$|As American forces {{continued}} to approach Luzon, the Japanese Imperial High Command ordered that all able-bodied POWs be transported to Japan. From the Cabanatuan camp, over 1,600 soldiers were removed in October1944, leaving over 500sick, weak, or disabled POWs. On January6, 1945, {{all of the}} guards withdrew from the Cabanatuan camp, leaving the POWs alone. The guards had previously told prisoner leaders {{that they should not}} attempt to escape, or else they would be killed. When the guards left, the prisoners heeded the threat, fearing that the Japanese were waiting near <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>and</b> would use the attempted escape as an excuse to execute them all. Instead, the prisoners went to the guards' side of <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>and</b> ransacked the Japanese buildings for supplies and large amounts of food. Prisoners were alone for several weeks, except when retreating Japanese forces would periodically stay in the camp. The soldiers mainly ignored the POWs, except to ask for food. Although aware of the consequences, the prisoners sent a small group outside the prison's gates to bring in twocarabaos to slaughter. The meat from the animals, along with the food secured from the Japanese side of the camp, helped many of the POWs to regain their strength, weight, and stamina. In mid-January, a large group of Japanese troops entered <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>and</b> returned the prisoners to their side of the camp. The prisoners, fueled by rumors, speculated that they would soon be executed by the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|The Resistance execute {{an attack}} on a Nazi {{research}} facility in London, bombing their base of operations, stealing secret documents and prototype stealth helicopters. The documents reveal the Nazis are relying on reverse-engineered technology derived from an ancient organization known as Da'at Yichud, which created such inventions as energy weapons, computer AI's, and super concrete; however, it is also revealed that someone is tampering with the super concrete's formula, making it susceptible to mold deterioration. The Resistance discover a match with Da'at Yichud member Set Roth (Mark Ivanir), who is imprisoned in a forced labor camp. Blazkowicz agrees to go undercover inside <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>and</b> meets Set, who tells him that the Nazis have been using technology made by him and other Jewish scientists to mass-produce and control robots, and offers to help the Resistance in return for the destruction of the labor camp. Blazkowicz finds a battery for a device that controls the camp robots, which he and Set then use to destroy <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>and</b> rescue prisoners.|$|E
5|$|After a 10-day forced march north, {{and having}} {{received}} only basic medical attention, Large {{arrived at a}} prison camp outside Chongsung, about 50 miles north east of Sinuiju. He {{spent two years in}} <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>and</b> celebrated his 21st birthday there. Throughout his incarceration he had two bullets and at least 18 pieces of shrapnel embedded in his body. To help Large cope with the chronic pain of his untreated injuries, an American POW introduced him to marijuana, which grew wild in the area. Although he found it to be a highly effective– and enjoyable– painkiller, he was somewhat alarmed by its psychoactive effects and subsequently tried to limit his use of the drug. Like many of his fellow prisoners, Large also suffered from beri-beri and dysentery.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} groups of {{personnel}} began arriving at Redbank, in south-east Queensland, {{in the middle}} of May, the battalion's headquarters moved to <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>and</b> basic training commenced in June under instructors from the Australian Instructional Corps. In early July, the majority of the battalion was transported by train to Pinkenba, and from there to Darwin, in Australia's north, aboard the troopship Zealandia. Tasked with defending the port and its surrounds, the battalion was based around Vestey's meatworks near Mindil Beach, and {{in the months that followed}} was occupied with vital asset protection and area defence in between individual and collective training exercises. Personnel were joined by the majority of their vehicles, including 14 tracked Bren carriers in August, as well as a group of reinforcements. In October, elements of the battalion were used as stevedores during a wharf labourers' strike.|$|E

5|$|Aged 17, Brooks swam 51.91s in Perth in January 1980, {{breaking}} Tonelli's Australian {{record in}} the 100m freestyle. As a result, {{he was invited to}} his first national training camp under Bill Sweetenham for prospective Olympic swimmers. He had the first of his many clashes with sporting administrators, first claiming that the officials did not want him to board with Tonelli's family and then stating that Sweetenham had only coached him two or three times, which he felt was insufficient. Brooks walked out of <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>and</b> returned to Perth to train under Duff. At the Australian Championships, the 100m was seen as a clash between Tonelli and Brooks. The latter came second in the 100m freestyle, outsprinted in the dying stages by Tonelli, who reclaimed his national record in a time of 51.80s. As a result, Brooks was selected in both the individual event and the 4100m medley relay.|$|E
5|$|As {{the civil}} disobedience {{campaign}} {{spread to other}} parts of the north-east, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike accused ITAK of trying to establish a separate state. In April 1961 the satyagrahas were removed by the army using brutal force. A state of emergency was declared on 18 April 1961. ITAK was banned, and its MPs and other leading members arrested and imprisoned at Panagoda Cantonment. Chelvanayakam was allowed to leave <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>and</b> return home due to his deteriorating health. Chelvanayakam suffered from Parkinson's disease and his hearing had been gradually failing. After initially refusing, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike allowed Chelvanayakam to travel to the UK to undergo surgery in Edinburgh at the hands of a neurosurgeon Francis John Gillingham. The operation was successful and after a few months recuperating in London Chelvanayakam returned to Ceylon.|$|E
5|$|At its peak, {{the camp}} held 8,000American {{soldiers}} (along {{with a small}} number of soldiers and civilians from other nations including the United Kingdom, Norway, and the Netherlands), making it the largest POW camp in the Philippines.

5|$|Continuous {{building}} and land acquisitions increased {{the size of}} the orphanage grounds to nearly 150 acres (600 dunam) by World War I. At the beginning of World War II, the British mandatory government deported the German teachers and turned the compound into a closed military camp with the largest ammunition stockpile in the Middle East. On March 17, 1948, the British abandoned <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>and</b> the Etzioni Brigade of the Haganah used it as a base of operations during the 1948 Israeli War of Independence. For the next 60 years the site served as an Israeli army base known as Camp Schneller. The army vacated the premises in 2008. As of 2011, the compound is being developed for luxury housing.|$|E
5|$|Few inmates {{remained}} in the camp after the gassings stopped, mostly non-Jewish {{women who had been}} married to Jews. They were released several days later, after being sworn to secrecy. Apart from Sajmište inmates, the 500 patients and staff of the Belgrade Jewish Hospital, as well as Jewish prisoners from the nearby Banjica concentration camp, were also killed in the gas van. The last Jewish prisoner in Sajmište was killed on 8 May 1942, and the gas van used at the camp was returned to Berlin on 9 June 1942. It received a technical upgrade there, and was then transferred to Belarus where it was used to gas Jews in Minsk.
