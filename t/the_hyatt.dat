5|$|Since 1969, <b>the</b> <b>Hyatt</b> {{plant has}} worked in tandem with an {{extensive}} pumped-storage operation comprising two offstream reservoirs west of Oroville. These two facilities are collectively known as the Oroville-Thermalito Complex. Water is diverted into the upper Thermalito reservoir (Thermalito Forebay) via the Thermalito Diversion Dam on the Feather River. During periods of off-peak power use, surplus energy generated at Hyatt is used to lift water from Thermalito's lower reservoir (the Thermalito Afterbay) to the forebay, which releases water back into the afterbay to generate up to 114 MW of power at times of high demand. <b>The</b> <b>Hyatt</b> and Thermalito plants produce an average of 2.2 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity each year, {{about half of the}} total power produced by the SWP's eight hydroelectric facilities.|$|E
