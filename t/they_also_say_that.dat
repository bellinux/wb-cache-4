Opponents of streaming by ability claim that streaming is unfair, that parents from higher socio-economic groups are more effective in sending children of similar aptitude to higher-level schools (Gymnasium). Proponents of streaming claim that it limits income segregation {{between rich and poor}} areas, as wealthier parents in poor neighborhoods may still send their gifted children to a fairly good public school due to streaming, giving them less motivation to move to a wealthier area. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> potential access to a Selective school would allow gifted children of lower-class parents living in poor neighborhoods better educational opportunities than if they were confined to schools with the average pupil population of their neighborhoods.|$|E

Conservative groups in the U.S. have opposed the concept of making HPV vaccination mandatory for pre-adolescent girls, asserting that making the vaccine mandatory is a violation of parental rights. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it will lead to early sexual activity, giving a false sense of immunity to sexually transmitted disease. (See Peltzman effect) Both the Family Research Council and the group Focus on the Family support widespread (universal) availability of HPV vaccines but oppose mandatory HPV vaccinations for entry to public school. Parents also express confusion over recent mandates for entry to public school pointing out that HPV is transmitted through sexual contact, not through attending school with other children.|$|E
25|$|The unusual {{lifestyle}} and growth pattern of Kiryas Joel {{has led to}} litigation {{on a number of}} fronts. In 1994, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet that the Kiryas Joel school district, which covered only the village, was designed in violation of the Establishment Clause of the 1st Amendment, because the design accommodated one group on the basis of religious affiliation. Subsequently, the New York State Legislature established a similar school district in the village that has passed legal muster. Further litigation has resulted over what entity should pay for the education of children with disabilities in Kiryas Joel, and over whether the community's boys must ride buses driven by women. A case against the village is currently pending in federal district court; plaintiffs, who are asking for the village to be dissolved, say that Kiryas Joel is a theocracy whose existence violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, where local government leaders abuse the laws, such as those for tax-exempt status, zoning, and sanitation, to favor members of their own sect and persecute other Orthodox Jews. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the leaders commit vote fraud by intimidating dissident voters and busing in non-residents.|$|E

25|$|The Central Tibetan Administration {{also says}} that {{millions}} of Chinese immigrants to the TAR are diluting the Tibetans both culturally and through intermarriage. Exile groups say that despite recent attempts to restore the appearance of original Tibetan culture to attract tourism, the traditional Tibetan {{way of life is}} now irrevocably changed. It is also reported that when Hu Yaobang, the general secretary of the Communist Party of China, visited Lhasa in 1980 he was unhappy when he found out the region was behind neighbouring provinces. Reforms were instituted, and since then the central government's policy in Tibet has granted most religious freedoms. But monks and nuns are still sometimes imprisoned, and many Tibetans (mostly monks and nuns) continue to flee Tibet yearly. At the same time, many Tibetans believe projects that the PRC implement to benefit Tibet, such as the China Western Development economic plan or the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, are politically motivated actions to consolidate central control over Tibet by facilitating militarization and Han Chinese migration while benefiting few Tibetans; they also believe the money funneled into cultural restoration projects as being aimed at attracting foreign tourists. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> there is still preferential treatment awarded to Han Chinese in the labor market as opposed to Tibetans.|$|E

Furthermore the study looks at {{the advantages and disadvantages}} the teachers experience with this form of teaching. The study presents in which way other scientists and teachers have described advantages and/or disadvantages with group lessons in singing and which frames matter to their experiences. The study contains qualitative interviews with five song teachers, who all have different experiences of this form of teaching. The teacher’s service contains room for different types of basic level education and to separate the frames such as resources and educational rules. The picture painted by the teachers matches the literature and previous studies within the subject. Everyone agrees {{that there are a lot}} of advantages with group lessons but many of the song teachers and scientists say, at the same time, that it works as a compliment to individual teaching in song. The teachers <b>say</b> <b>that</b> a lot of lectures, traditionally taught individually, can be approached in a different way with group lessons. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> social skills, communication, interpretation, adaptation, cooperation and connection to the audience are skills which is particularly well taught in groups. Group dynamics and the teachers approach is of great importance when it comes to how effective the group works together and which norms and values are contained within the group. The teachers interviewed in this study points out that the students take bigger responsibility to their own learning when taught in groups as a consequence of respecting their fellow students, which previous scientist also has pointed out. The importance of interaction between students and to be part of bigger context is also mentioned. This matches the music scene in society by large which is riddled with responsibility, interaction and enjoying time together with the aid of music.
