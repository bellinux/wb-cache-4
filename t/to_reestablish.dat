5|$|Carolyn Dinshaw {{argues that}} the poem {{may have been a}} {{response}} to accusations that Richard II had a male lover—an attempt <b>to</b> <b>reestablish</b> the idea that heterosexuality was the Christian norm. Around the time the poem was written, the Catholic Church was beginning to express concerns about kissing between males. Many religious figures were trying to make the distinction between strong trust and friendship between males and homosexuality. Still, the Pearl Poet seems to have been simultaneously entranced and repulsed by homosexual desire. In his other poem Cleanness, he points out several grievous sins, but spends lengthy passages describing them in minute detail. His obsession seems to carry into Gawain in his descriptions of the Green Knight.|$|E

Sviatoslav's campaign established the Rus's hold on the north-south trade routes, helping to alter the demographics of the region.
