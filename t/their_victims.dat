5|$|Raksogana-bhojana (food of Rakshasas): Those who {{practise}} human-sacrifice and cannibalism are {{condemned to}} this hell. <b>Their</b> <b>victims,</b> {{in the form}} of Rakshasas, cut them with sharp knives and swords. The Rakshasas feast on their blood and sing and dance in joy, just as the sinners slaughtered <b>their</b> <b>victims.</b>|$|E

5|$|There were 10 gunmen, nine of {{whom were}} {{subsequently}} shot dead and one captured by security forces. Witnesses reported that {{they seemed to be}} in their early twenties, wore black T-shirts and jeans, and that they smiled and looked happy as they shot <b>their</b> <b>victims.</b>|$|E

5|$|They {{can strike}} to a {{distance}} of about one third of their body length, but juveniles will launch their entire bodies forwards in the process. These snakes rarely grip <b>their</b> <b>victims,</b> instead releasing quickly to return to the striking position.|$|E
5|$|Late at night, Hilarion mourns at Giselle's {{grave in}} the forest, but is frightened {{away by the}} arrival of the Wilis, the ghostly spirits of maidens betrayed by their lovers. The Wilis, led by their merciless queen Myrtha, haunt the forest at night to seek revenge on any man they encounter, forcing <b>their</b> <b>victims</b> to dance until they die of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|Many reviewers {{identified}} an {{allusion to}} the Moors murders, committed by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, a British couple who killed children in the 1960s. Ryan Lambie of Den of Geek also found similarities between the episode and Ian Huntley and Maxine Carr's crimes. The A.V. Club David Sims emphasised the similarities between Victoria's taping {{and the fact that}} Hindley taped the torture of one of <b>their</b> <b>victims.</b>|$|E

5|$|Mites and {{nematodes}} feed on ticks, {{which are}} also a minor nutritional resource for birds. More importantly, they carry diseases as the primary hosts of pathogens such as spirochaetes, and without their agency, the organisms could not reach their secondary hosts. The diseases caused may debilitate <b>their</b> <b>victims,</b> and ticks may thus be assisting in controlling animal populations and preventing overgrazing.|$|E
5|$|Romanian vampires {{were said}} to bite <b>their</b> <b>victims</b> over the heart or between the eyes, and sudden deaths could {{indicate}} {{the presence of a}} vampire. Graves were often opened five or seven years after burial and the corpse checked for vampirism, before being washed and reburied.|$|E
5|$|As the Martians ravage Las Vegas with Art Land, a Las Vegas developer, {{being among}} <b>their</b> <b>victims,</b> Byron Williams, a casino {{employee}} and former world champion boxer, leads {{a small group}} of survivors consisting of Barbara Land (Art's wife), Tom Jones, a beautiful waitress named Cindy, and a gambling lawyer to an airfield in the hopes of flying a small jet to safety. They barely make it, losing the lawyer in the process, but discover a large group of Martians stationed there as they are preparing to take off. Byron creates a diversion by challenging them to a fistfight. While he succeeds in killing the Ambassador, he is outnumbered and overwhelmed, but Tom, Barbara and Cindy escape.|$|E

5|$|Eight {{species of}} {{crocodilians}} {{are known to}} have attacked humans. The largest number of attacks comes from the Nile crocodile. Humans are the greatest threat to crocodilian populations through activities that include hunting and habitat destruction, but farming of crocodilians has greatly reduced unlawful trading in wild skins. Artistic and literary representations of crocodilians have appeared in human cultures around the world since at least Ancient Egypt. The earliest known mention of the story that crocodiles weep for <b>their</b> <b>victims</b> was in the 9th century; it was later spread by Sir John Mandeville in 1400 and then by William Shakespeare in the late 16th century and early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Kitsune {{are often}} {{presented}} as tricksters, with motives that vary from mischief to malevolence. Stories tell of kitsune playing tricks on overly proud samurai, greedy merchants, and boastful commoners, while the crueler ones abuse poor tradesmen and farmers or devout Buddhist monks. <b>Their</b> <b>victims</b> are usually men; women are possessed instead. For example, kitsune {{are thought to}} employ their kitsunebi to lead travelers astray {{in the manner of}} a will o' the wisp. Another tactic is for the kitsune to confuse its target with illusions or visions. Other common goals of trickster kitsune include seduction, theft of food, humiliation of the prideful, or vengeance for a perceived slight.|$|E
5|$|Schlesselman and Cowart chatted on the Internet {{about how}} {{to carry out the}} operation. Schlesselman {{suggested}} using a sawed-off shotgun because {{it would be easy to}} maneuver; he also said he planned to steal a gun from his father. Prior to their arrest, the men decorated their car with a Swastika and drew the numbers 88 and 14 on their hood using window chalk. Authorities believe the men may have planned to move from state to state to choose <b>their</b> <b>victims.</b> They also planned to wear white tuxedos and top hats during the assassination attempt.|$|E
25|$|For these rapists, {{they have}} a sexual {{association}} with anger and power so that aggression and the infliction of pain itself is eroticized. For this rapist, sexual excitement {{is associated with the}} inflicting of pain upon <b>their</b> <b>victim.</b> The offender finds the intentional maltreatment of <b>their</b> <b>victim</b> intensely gratifying and takes pleasure in the victim's torment, pain, anguish, distress, helplessness, and suffering; he/she finds the victim's struggling with him/her to be an erotic experience.|$|R
50|$|Cyberstalking {{is a form}} {{of online}} {{harassment}} in which the perpetrator uses electronic communications to stalk a victim. Cyberstalking is considered more dangerous than other forms of cyberbullying because it generally involves a credible threat to the safety of the victim. Cyberstalkers may send repeated messages intended to threaten or harass <b>their</b> <b>victim.</b> They may encourage others to do the same, either explicitly or by impersonating <b>their</b> <b>victim</b> and asking others to contact them.|$|R
50|$|In 27 states, {{a rapist}} who got <b>their</b> <b>victim</b> pregnant, can legally sue for visitation, {{and in some}} cases even custody.|$|R
5|$|The {{adults of}} some Australian cicada {{are subject to}} a cicada-specific fungus from the genus Massospora, which grows on their {{genitalia}} and abdominal cavity, eventually causing the tail end to drop off. Australian cicadas are further preyed on by the cicada killer wasp (Exeirus lateritius), which stings and paralyses cicadas high in the trees. <b>Their</b> <b>victims</b> drop to the ground where the cicada-hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with its hind legs, sometimes over a distance of 100m (330ft). They are then shoved into the hunter's burrow, where the helpless cicada is placed on a shelf in an often extensive 'catacomb', to form food-stock for the wasp grub growing from the eggs deposited within.|$|E
5|$|Advisors {{are large}} larvae-like creatures which are {{virtually}} featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, {{though they do}} possess an eye-like mechanical device attached {{to the left side}} of their heads, and detachable mechanical arms. Their faces are covered by a form of respirator, which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like orifice from which extends a long flexible proboscis. With this, they can examine objects, or attack and kill enemies. Advisors appear to be feeding upon their victim during their attacks. It is implied that Advisors are the original master race behind the Combine, with the Earth administrator Wallace Breen answering directly to them. Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess telekinetic powers with which they are able to float through the air and immobilize enemies so that their proboscis can examine <b>their</b> <b>victims</b> without interference. Their appearance was based on the Guild Navigators from the film Dune.|$|E
5|$|All {{four main}} Einsatzgruppen {{took part in}} mass shootings {{from the early days}} of the war. Initially the targets were adult Jewish men, but by August the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderlyâ€”the entire Jewish population. Initially there was a semblance of {{legality}} given to the shootings, with trumped-up charges being read out (arson, sabotage, black marketeering, or refusal to work, for example) and victims being killed by a firing squad. As this method proved too slow, the Einsatzkommandos began to take <b>their</b> <b>victims</b> out in larger groups and shot them next to, or even inside, mass graves that had been prepared. Some Einsatzkommandos started to use automatic weapons, with survivors being killed with a pistol shot.|$|E
60|$|Once outside, the {{centipede}} {{seemed to}} have disappeared, and his prospective murderers began a thorough but cautious search for <b>their</b> <b>victim.</b>|$|R

5|$|As the two P-51s {{crossed over}} the Seine and reached Rambouillet, they sighted a {{formation}} of enemy aircraft. Brief bursts of machine gun fire dispatched four Focke-Wulf Fw 56 trainersâ€”two falling to MacLachlan. <b>Their</b> <b>victims</b> were from JG 105. Gefreiter Walter Seigler was killed in Wrk. Nr. 1868 and Kurt Prager died in Wrk Nr. 2438. Gefreiter Alois Erdl was wounded and the aircraft written off and the fourth was able to force-land safely, damaged. Gefreiter Gotze-Gerd Kuhn was unhurt. They continued their hunt and flying near Bretigny spotted two Ju 88 night fighters or bombers coming into land. MacLachlan destroyed the first and shared the second with Page. Both aircraft belonged to IV./Kampfgeschwader 6 (KG 6â€”Bomber Wing 6). The pilotsâ€”Gefreiter Gerhard Zimmermann and Unteroffizier Karl Brocksâ€”were killed. The Mustangs retreated when the airfield defences retaliated with gunfire. MacLachlan and Page returned at 1,000 feet and crossed the coast south-west of Dieppe and crossed between Brighton and Newhaven upon their return. MacLachlan was awarded a second Bar to his DFC while Page received the DFC.|$|E
5|$|As word of {{the massacres}} got out, many Jews fled; in Ukraine, 70 to 90 per cent of the Jews ran away. This was seen by the leader of Einsatzkommando VI as beneficial, as it would save the regime the costs of deporting the victims further east over the Urals. In other areas the {{invasion}} was so successful that the Einsatzgruppen had insufficient forces to immediately kill all the Jews in the conquered territories. A situation report from Einsatzgruppe C in September 1941 noted that not all Jews {{were members of the}} Bolshevist apparatus, and suggested that the total elimination of Jewry would {{have a negative impact on}} the economy and the food supply. The Nazis began to round <b>their</b> <b>victims</b> up into concentration camps and ghettos and rural districts were for the most part rendered Judenfrei (free of Jews). Jewish councils were set up in major cities and forced labour gangs were established to make use of the Jews as slave labour until they were totally eliminated, a goal that was postponed until 1942.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds will rob other seabirds such as boobies, {{particularly}} the red-footed booby, tropicbirds, shearwaters, petrels, terns, gulls and even ospreys of their catch, using their speed and manoeuvrability to outrun and harass <b>their</b> <b>victims</b> until they regurgitate their stomach contents. They may either assail their targets {{after they have}} caught their food or circle high over seabird colonies waiting for parent birds to return laden with food. Although frigatebirds are renowned for their kleptoparasitic feeding behaviour, kleptoparasitism is not thought to play {{a significant part of}} the diet of any species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting. A study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, the Government of Turkey {{proposed}} {{legislation that would}} overturn a man conviction for child sex assault if they married <b>their</b> <b>victim.</b>|$|R
