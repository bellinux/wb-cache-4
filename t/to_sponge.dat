500|$|The culinary {{historian}} Alison Sim {{notes that}} [...] "the closest the Tudors came <b>to</b> <b>sponge</b> were sponge-like biscuits", {{which could be}} raised with eggs or with yeast; the [...] "cracknels" [...] in the Jewell were boiled before baking, being put into boiling water where they would sink and then rise to the top. Sim notes that Dawson's [...] "fine bisket bread" [...] had to be beaten for two hours.|$|E
2500|$|Dried eggs of Triops longicaudatus {{are sold}} in kits to be raised as {{aquarium}} pets, sold {{under the name of}} [...] "aquasaurs", [...] "trigons" [...] or [...] "triops". These are most often of the greenish-brown variety, but the red variant is fairly common among enthusiasts. Captive Triops are frequently kept in aquariums and fed a diet consisting mainly of carrots, shrimp pellets and dried shrimp. Often they are also given living shrimp and daphnia as live prey. Because they can feed on just about anything, they are also fed lunch meat, potatoes, crackers, etc. They will often feed themselves by grazing on algae and other grunge from the bottom and sides of the tank and on small particles clinging <b>to</b> <b>sponge</b> filters or to Marimo moss balls, which are often cultured alongside Triops.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} holozoans, apart from animals, are the choanoflagellates, which {{strongly}} resemble the collar cells of sponges, {{and so were}} theorized to be related <b>to</b> <b>sponges</b> even in the 19th century.

25|$|These are the {{earliest}} multicellular organisms in Earth’s history, {{despite the fact}} that unicellularity had {{been around for a long}} time before that. The requirements for multicellularity were embedded in the genes of some of these cells, specifically choanoflagellates. These are thought to be the precursors for all multicellular organisms. They are highly related <b>to</b> <b>sponges</b> (Porifera), which are the simplest multicellular organisms.|$|R
50|$|The big-belly seahorse {{is found}} among algae, seagrasses, and rocky reefs in shallow water, and {{attached}} <b>to</b> <b>sponges</b> and colonial hydroids in deeper areas. They also attach to jetty piles and other man-made objects, {{and can be}} found in estuaries. They usually inhabit waters less than 50 m deep, but have been found as deep as 104 m. Juveniles are pelagic or attached to drifting seaweed.|$|R

25|$|Not all reefs in {{the past}} were formed by corals: those in the Early Cambrian (542–513 Ma) {{resulted}} from calcareous algae and archaeocyathids (small animals with conical shape, probably related <b>to</b> <b>sponges)</b> and in the Late Cretaceous (100–66 Ma), when there also existed reefs formed {{by a group of}} bivalves called rudists; one of the valves formed the main conical structure and the other, much smaller valve acted as a cap.|$|R

50|$|Since their fossils show {{no signs}} of a gut or other organs, chancelloriids were {{originally}} classified {{as some kind of}} sponge. Butterfield and Nicholas (1996) argued that they were closely related <b>to</b> <b>sponges</b> {{on the grounds that the}} detailed structure of chancellorid sclerites is similar to that of fibers of spongin, a collagen protein, in modern keratose (horny) demosponges. However Janussen, Steiner and Zhu (2002) denied that chancellorids were sponges on the grounds that: chancellorids' hollow sclerites, probably made of aragonite, were quite different from the solid, silica-based spines of demosponges; sponges have simple skins that are only one cell thick, while chancellorids' thicker, more complex skins resemble those of more complex animals. In their opinion chancellorids were at least members of the Epitheliazoa, a grade more complex than the Porifera, <b>to</b> which <b>sponges</b> belong.|$|R

50|$|Arnesen {{published}} {{her first}} paper in 1898 on {{the anatomy of}} corals, but she is most renowned today for her contributions {{to the study of}} sponges. She was most likely the first Norwegian <b>to</b> study <b>sponges</b> and few Norwegians have focused on the species since. Arnesen published papers on sponges between 1901 and 1920, with her 1903 paper on the geographical distribution of sponges being especially important.Arnesen wrote a text book to be used for high school level zoology, which focused heavily on Charles Darwin's ideas about evolution. She also published the first guidebook for the zoological museum in 1912. This covered the many different groups of invertebrates and explained collections that were on display.Arnesen's contribution <b>to</b> <b>sponges</b> is acknowledged in the names of two species of sponges: Gellius arnesenae Arndt (1927) and Anchinoe arneseni Topsent (1913).|$|R
40|$|A {{controlled}} {{clinical study}} compared {{the effectiveness of}} sponging with tepid water, ice water, and equal parts of 70 per cent isopropyl alcohol and water in addition to orally administered acetaminophen to reduce fever in children.

Sponging with ice water or with alcohol in water were equally effective and significantly superior <b>to</b> <b>sponging</b> with tepid water; however, sponging with tepid water afforded significantly better comfort during the sponging procedure...|$|R

5000|$|The {{classification}} of chancelloriids is difficult, contentious and important to paleontologists' {{view of the}} evolution of multi-celled animals. Walcott classified chancelloriids as sponges, a view that was first queried by Bengston and colleagues, who considered the hollow, multi-part spicules to be quite unlike anything secreted by a sponge. [...] Butterfield and Nicholas (1996) argued that they were closely related <b>to</b> <b>sponges</b> {{on the grounds that the}} detailed structure of chancellorid sclerites is similar to that of fibers of spongin, a collagen protein, in modern keratose (horny) demosponges such as Darwinella.|$|R
