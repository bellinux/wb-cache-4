The mathematical model is established by utilising the numerical data obtained from the previous Finite Element Analysis [Y. Ding, R. Jones, B. T.

The spalling depths, calculated by the model due to various contact loads and crack sizes, are compared with the experimentally measured spalling depths obtained under corresponding loading conditions.

Whereas the {{interpretation}} of the low frequency vibration characteristics generated by operating machinery is relatively well understood, the use of the high frequencies, sonic and above, to predict conditions such as blade and gear tooth performance is in its infancy. With the vast amount of data available the basic problem becomes one of identifying, correlating and isolating individual characteristics so that small changes can be recognized in sufficient time to take corrective action. Demodulation followed by spectrum analysis as well as spectrum analysis by itself are two data reduction techniques discussed.

Beside the improvement of simulation technique, this paper points out the potential of process stabilization by high rates of SSV, even though variation frequencies and amplitudes nowadays are still limited by the drive power of machine tool systems.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the gear coupling {{mechanics of the}} ancient Antikythera mechanism, among whose distinctive characteristics was the triangular shaping of the <b>teeth.</b> The <b>engagement</b> of the <b>tooth</b> pairs is analyzed in detail, estimating the temporal variation of the speed ratio due to the back and forth shifting of the relative instant center. The admissibility of the theoretical contact points is carefully checked, and {{the magnitude of the}} successive tooth collisions is calculated, together with the energy losses arising from the particular nature of the coupling. Some interesting results are that only one tooth pair turns out to be active at each time instant and the real path may belong only to the approach or to the recess region entirely, or may split into separate sub-phases, in approach and in recess, or may even straddle both regions. The occurrence of each of these conditions depends on the average speed ratio (tooth ratio) and on the assigned clearance between the wheels. It is also found that the speed oscillation is roughly contained in a ± 10 % range and the efficiency may reach rather high values, despite the presumable crude finishing of the ancient gearwheels due to the rather rudimentary technology used {{in the construction of the}} tooth profiles...|$|R

On the contact line, the magnitude of tooth load is greater at the points that have higher meshing stiffness and lower deformation.

40|$|Coupling {{worm gears}} in large machine tool {{manipulator}} units (axes) {{can lead to}} overload damages under some operating conditions, like asymmetrical driving and emergency stop. This behaviour {{is caused by the}} self locking characteristic of worm gears with small pitch. If operated in the direction opposite to the designated one, self-locking can occur in the gears, subjecting the gears to an arbitrary torque which can be destructive. This condition can occur without counter torque on the driving side. In most gears, <b>tooth</b> <b>engagement</b> is based on a rolling motion. The slip component increases with a growing axis angle between the paired gears. In case of worm gears, the axis angle is 90 _, and therefore the coupling is purely frictious. This friction coupling is important in modelling. Especially the transition between the static and dynamic friction, where the system parameters change abruptly by a factor of two, should not be neglected. Based on the evaluated model a synchronous controller has been developed.

40|$|Idele Wheel whining is a {{phenomenon}} which is predominantly familiar to motor vehicle gear boxes. Usually all the gear wheels are in constant <b>tooth</b> <b>engagement.</b> For this reason one gear wheel from each gear must be supplied with a bearing in order to permit the differences in rotational speeds across the shafts. These wheels, most of which rotate on roller bearings, are described as idle wheels. At very low temperatures in the start up phase a whine like noise is produced by the loose wheel. The noise emission {{does not come from}} the tooth engagements but from the idle wheel bearing. Extensive measurements of idle wheels were carried out at a test stand. A simulation program for lightly respectively not loaded roller bearings has been developped in order to clarify the mechanism of origin of the noise. The foundation for the calculation of the forces in the lubricant film is the instationary hydrodynamic lubricant theory. In order to estimate the critical oil viscosity for noise, simple equations are available to the designer. (orig.)

40|$|This paper explores ways {{in which}} gear teeth that possess 2 ̆ 2 {{designed}} compliance 2 ̆ 2; that is, tooth flexure that {{is an integral part}} of the designed mechanical system, affect transmission of angular motion and torque. It is commonly assumed that deformation of engineered components is counterproductive to the function and performance of machinery and, hence, must be minimized. However, none of the current gear designs alone can address problems such as absorption of shock loads, vibration (2 ̆ 2 chatter 2 ̆ 2) attenuation, and reduction of the overall mass and inertia. Allowing gear teeth to have a designed flexibility is another way of approaching the above problems in gear system design. In this study, the deformation of flexible gear teeth is treated as a classical curved beam deformation problem. A quasi-static, mechanics based model is used for computing displacements of slender tooth profiles subjected to contact forces that arise during the <b>tooth</b> <b>engagement</b> process. The teeth are analyzed as slender cantilever circular beams with a constant curvature and the curved beam model is based on the Castigliano 2 ̆ 7 s energy theory for displacement. Non-dimensional parameters are created to study the effects of various design parameters on gear properties such as the pressure line and the satisfaction of the law of gearing. It is observed from conducted studies that the engagement process involving teeth with circular profiles has properties which differ from those of rigid gears with involute profile teeth. The pressure line for gears with circular teeth is not linear and the law of gearing is not satisfied with this profile. These differences increase further when compliance is introduced into gear teeth. However, effects of tooth compliance on the engagement process are expected to equally apply to gears whose teeth have other profiles as well...|$|E
40|$|NASA s {{initiative}} for Lunar and Martian exploration will require long lived, robust drive systems for manned vehicles that must operate in hostile environments. The operation of these mechanical drives will pose {{a problem because}} of the existing extreme operating conditions. Some of these extreme conditions include operating {{at a very high}} or very cold temperature, operating over a wide range of temperatures, operating in very dusty environments, operating in a very high radiation environment, and operating in possibly corrosive environments. Current drive systems use gears with various configurations of teeth. These gears must be lubricated with oil (or grease) and must have some sort of a lubricant resupply system. For drive systems, oil poses problems such as evaporation, becoming too viscous and eventually freezing at cold temperatures, being too thin to lubricate at high temperatures, being degraded by the radiation environment, being contaminated by the regolith (soil), and if vaporized (and not sealed), it will contaminate the regolith. Thus, it may not be advisable or even possible to use oil because of these limitations. An oil-less, compact traction vehicle drive is a drive designed for use in hostile environments like those that will be encountered on planetary surfaces. Initially, traction roller tests in vacuum were conducted to obtain traction and endurance data needed for designing the drives. From that data, a traction drive was designed that would fit into a prototype lunar rover vehicle, and this design data was used to construct several traction drives. These drives were then tested in air to determine their performance characteristics, and if any final corrections to the designs were necessary. A limitation with current speed reducer systems such as planetary gears and harmonic drives is the high-contact stresses that occur at <b>tooth</b> <b>engagement</b> and in the harmonic drive wave generator interface. These high stresses induce high wear of solid lubricant coatings, thus necessitating the use of liquid lubricants for long life...|$|E
30|$|In contrast, physics-based models {{resort to}} {{physical}} laws governing the defect growth, where the values or distributions {{of the model}} parameters in the physical models, e.g., material dependent parameters, are kept constant {{and will not be}} updated based on condition monitoring information. A commonly used law to describe crack propagation is Paris’ law, which was originated in Ref. [16]. Many publications are devoted to devising numerical algorithms to calculate the quantity (e.g., stress intensity factor) needed in Paris’ law. Readers can refer to Refs. [8 – 10] for these approaches in which finite element modeling was discussed for stress analysis near crack tip. In the physics-based prognostic models, component failure time is defined as when the defect size exceeds a critical value. Authors of Ref. [11] investigated several factors that influence the crack growth trajectory in the gear tooth, including backup ratio, initial crack location, fillet geometry, rim/web compliance, gear size and pressure angle. The research work in Ref. [12] took account of the variation of moving load on gear tooth into crack growth prediction by breaking the <b>tooth</b> <b>engagement</b> into multiple steps. Authors in Ref. [13] applied Paris’ law to predict fatigue crack growth with utilization of transmission error to estimate the current crack size, which improved predictive accuracy. The service life of gears was divided into crack initiation and crack propagation periods in Ref. [14]. The strain-life method was used to determine the time required for crack initiation, while Paris’ law was used to obtain the time required for the crack to grow from initial crack size to the critical value. Kacprzynksi et al. [15] developed a prognostic tool which predicts gear failure probability by fusing physics-of-failure models and diagnostics information. The results showed variance reduction in failure probability when diagnostics information was present. Physical models can achieve high predictive accuracy if appropriately built. However, it demands comprehensive physics theory and intensive computation to build physical models of high-fidelity. Furthermore, physical models are unavailable for complex systems which limit its usages in real-world applications. In addition, physical models are deterministically used in the above mentioned literature, which means they are unable to address the uncertainty in failure.|$|E
40|$|Finite element {{analysis}} (FEA) is a computational {{technique of}} growing {{popularity in the}} field of comparative biomechanics, and is an easily accessible platform for form-function analyses of biological structures. However, its rapid evolution in recent years from a novel approach to common practice demands some scrutiny in regards to the validity of results and the appropriateness of assumptions inherent in setting up simulations. Both validation and sensitivity analyses remain unexplored in many comparative analyses, and assumptions considered to be ‘reasonable’ are often assumed to have little influence on the results and their interpretation. Here we report an extensive sensitivity analysis where high resolution finite element (FE) models of mandibles from seven species of crocodile were analysed under loads typical for comparative analysis: biting, shaking, and twisting. Simulations explored the effect on both the absolute response and the interspecies pattern of results to variations in commonly used input parameters. Our sensitivity analysis focuses on assumptions relating to the selection of material properties (heterogeneous or homogeneous), scaling (standardising volume, surface area, or length), tooth position (front, mid, or back <b>tooth</b> <b>engagement),</b> and linear load case (type of loading for each feeding type). Our findings show that in a comparative context, FE models are far less sensitive to the selection of material property values and scaling to either volume or surface area than they are to those assumptions relating to the functional aspects of the simulation, such as tooth position and linear load case. Results show a complex interaction between simulation assumptions, depending on the combination of assumptions and the overall shape of each specimen. Keeping assumptions consistent between models in an analysis does not ensure that results can be generalised beyond the specific set of assumptions used. Logically, different comparative datasets would also be sensitive to identical simulation assumptions; hence, modelling assumptions should undergo rigorous selection. The accuracy of input data is paramount, and simulations should focus on taking biological context into account. Ideally, validation of simulations should be addressed; however, where validation is impossible or unfeasible, sensitivity analyses should be performed to identify which assumptions have the greatest influence upon the results...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an elastohydrodynamic {{lubrication}} (EHL) solution method {{has been developed}} for helical Gears. Helical gears mesh {{with each other and}} develop contact areas under load that are approximately elliptical in shape. The contact ellipses have aspect ratios which are large and lubricant entrainment takes place in the rolling / sliding direction which is along the minor axis of the contact ellipse. The contact between helical gear teeth is therefore considered as a point contact EHL problem and the EHL analysis has been developed to include all aspects of the correct gear geometry. This includes the variation in radius of relative curvature at the contact over the meshing cycle, the introduction of tooth tip relief to prevent premature <b>tooth</b> <b>engagement</b> under load, and axial profile relief to prevent edge contact at the face boundaries of the teeth. The EHL solution is first obtained as a quasi-steady state analysis at different positions in the meshing cycle and then developed into a transient analysis for the whole meshing cycle. The software developed has been used to assess the effects of geometrical modifications such as tip relief and axial crowning on the EHL performance of a gear, and different forms of these profile modifications are studied. The analysis shows that the transient squeeze film effect becomes significant when the contact reaches the tip relief zone. Thinning of the film thickness occurs in this region and is associated with high values of pressure which depend on the form of tip relief considered. A transient EHL analysis for helical gears having faceted tooth surfaces has also been developed. Such surface features arise from the manufacturing process and can {{have a significant effect on}} the predicted transient EHL behaviour. The EHL results have been found to depend significantly on the facet spacing and thus on the manufacturing process. The important effect of surface roughness is also considered by developing a three dimensional line contact model to include real surface roughness information by considering a finite length of the nominal contact in the transverse direction of the tooth. This model is based on the use of the fast Fourier transform method to provide the repetition of the solution space along the nominal contact line between the helical teeth with the inclusion of cyclic boundary conditions at the transverse boundaries of the solution space. In helical gears the lay of tooth roughness (direction of finishing) is generally inclined to the direction in which rolling (entrainment) and sliding take place, and this is found to have a significant effect on both film thickness and pressure distribution...|$|E
