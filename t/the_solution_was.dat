Under Lipschitz continuity and linear growth assumptions, it is established that if <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> almost surely integrable, and also almost surely square integrable, then <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> almost surely asymptotically stable. Additionally, if <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> p-th mean asymptotically stable, and the p-th mean of <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> integrable, for p = 2, <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> almost surely asymptotically stable.

5|$|His {{reputation}} destroyed, Bouch died in October 1880. Work on {{the suspension}} bridge he had designed {{to cross the}} Firth of Forth was stopped after the Tay Bridge collapse and Barlow, Sir John Fowler and Thomas Elliot Harrison, consultant engineers for the three railway companies involved in the construction, were asked to choose a replacement design. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> the cantilevered Forth Bridge by Fowler and Sir Benjamin Baker.|$|E
5|$|Special {{technical}} solutions had to {{be designed}} for the accommodations for three adults to be confined in a small balloon basket for up to 30 days. The sleeping berths for the crew were fitted at {{the floor of the}} basket, along with some of stores and provisions. The highly flammable hydrogen meant that cooking could not be done in the basket itself. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> a modified primus stove (designed by a friend of Andrée's) that could be dangled 8m (26ft) below the crew and then lit from the basket, at a safe distance. An angled mirror attached to the specially designed stove allowed the crew to determine whether it was successfully lit or not.|$|E
5|$|A key {{development}} of the testing program was a miss-distance indicator system, which independently measured {{the distance between the}} Zeus and the target at the instant the computers initiated the detonation of the warhead. There were concerns that if the Zeus' own radars were used for this ranging measure, any systematic error in ranging would also be present in the test data, and thus would be hidden. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> the use of a separate UHF-frequency transmitter in the warhead reentry vehicle, and a receiver in the Zeus. The received signal was retransmitted to the ground, where its Doppler shift was examined to extract the range information. These instruments eventually demonstrated that the Zeus' own tracking information was accurate. For visual tracking, a small conventional warhead was used, which provided a flash that could be seen on long exposure photographs of the interceptions.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, several U.S. Navy {{submarines}} {{were forced}} back to base to repair {{damage caused by}} cookiecutter shark bites to the neoprene boots of their AN/BQR-19 sonar domes, which caused the sound-transmitting oil inside to leak and impaired navigation. An unknown enemy weapon was initially feared, before this shark was identified as the culprit, and the problem was solved by installing fiberglass covers around the domes. In the 1980s, some thirty U.S. Navy submarines were damaged by cookiecutter shark bites, mostly to the rubber-sheathed electric cable leading to the sounding probe used to ensure safety when surfacing in shipping zones.

5|$|In January 1952 Sihanouk re-appointed Penn Nouth {{as prime}} {{minister}} before leaving for France. Once there, Sihanouk wrote to French president Vincent Auriol requesting that he grant Cambodia full independence, citing widespread anti-French sentiment among the Cambodian populace. Auriol deferred Sihanouk's request to the French commissioner for overseas territories, Jean Letourneau, who promptly rejected it. Subsequently, Sihanouk traveled to Canada and the United States, where he gave radio interviews to present his case. He {{took advantage of the}} prevailing anti-communist sentiment in those countries, arguing that Cambodia faced a Communist threat {{similar to that of the}} Viet Minh in Vietnam, and that <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> to grant full independence to Cambodia. Sihanouk returned to Cambodia in June 1953, taking up residence in Siem Reap. He organised public rallies calling for Cambodians to fight for independence, and formed a citizenry militia which attracted about 130,000 recruits.|$|E
5|$|On 24 November 1939, Hanbury Brown wrote a memo on Suggestions for Fighter Control by RDF {{calling for}} {{a new type of}} radar that would {{directly}} display both the target aircraft and the intercepting fighter, allowing ground controllers to directly control the fighter without need for interpretation. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> to mount a radar on a motorized platform so it rotated continually, sweeping the entire sky. A motor in the CRT display would rotate the beam deflection plates in synchronicity, so blips seen when the antenna was at a particular angle would be displayed at the same angle on the scope display. Using a phosphor that lasted at least one rotation, blips for all targets within range would be drawn on the display at their correct relative angles, producing a map-like image known as a PPI. With both the bombers and fighters now appearing on the same display, the radar operator could now direct an intercept directly, eliminating all of the delays.|$|E

5|$|When George Clifford died in 1605, {{his wife}} Margaret became dowager countess and began {{repairing}} Brougham Castle, which became her favoured residence. Margaret contended with {{claims to the}} ownership of the family estates from her brother-in-law Francis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland, but held onto Brougham Castle. Her daughter, Lady Anne Clifford continued {{the restoration of the}} castle and other Clifford properties. The only one of Margaret's three children to survive childhood, Anne inherited the Clifford estates after her mother died in 1616. The inheritance was not without incident. The Earl of Cumberland again asserted his claim to the Clifford estates, however the privy council found in favour of Anne. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> only temporary, and in April 1617 the king decided that the Earl of Cumberland was the rightful heir, and the Clifford estates passed to Francis Clifford. Later the same year, JamesI visited Scotland and on his return journey he stayed at the castles of Carlisle, Brougham, and Appleby, where expensive banquets were given in his honour. It is estimated that the festivities cost around £1,200. After this, Brougham was almost forgotten by its owner and neglected.|$|E
