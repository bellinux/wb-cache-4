5|$|Numerous factors {{led to the}} {{evacuation}} of St Kilda. The islands' inhabitants had existed for centuries in relative isolation until tourism {{and the presence of}} the military during the First World War led the islanders to seek alternatives to privations they routinely suffered. The changes made to the island by visitors in the nineteenth century disconnected the islanders from <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> that had allowed their forebears to survive in this unique environment. Despite construction of a small jetty in 1902, the islands remained at the weather's mercy.|$|E

5|$|Justification {{for using}} the Sunnah {{as a source of}} law {{can be found in the}} Qur'an. The Qur'an {{commands}} Muslims to follow Muhammad. During his lifetime, Muhammad made it clear that his traditions (along with the Qur'an) should be followed after his death. The overwhelming majority of Muslims consider the sunnah to be essential supplements to and clarifications of the Qur'an. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Qur'an contains many rules for the behavior expected of Muslims but there are no specific Qur'anic rules on many religious and practical matters. Muslims believe that they can look at <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> or sunnah, of Muhammad and his companions to discover what to imitate and what to avoid.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} Lima, {{he stopped}} in Riobamba, {{where a group of}} priests asked him to write a reply to a report written by Ignacio Barreto, chief tax collector. The report accused the priests of Riobamba of various abuses against the Indians in order to take their money. Espejo gladly {{accepted}} the task because he wanted to settle accounts with Barreto and other citizens of Riobamba, among them José Miguel Vallejo, who had turned him in to the authorities when he tried to flee Requena's expedition to the Marañón river. He wrote Defensa de los curas de Riobamba (Defense of the clergy of Riobamba), a detailed study of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> of the Indians from Riobamba and a powerful attack on Barreto's report.|$|E
5|$|Reconstruction {{projects}} in the later parts of the 20th century have caused local protests by entities such as the town of Hempstead and the village of Westbury. The latter was concerned about construction affecting <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in Westbury, and the mayor and citizens wanted confirmation that the reconstruction of Northern State Parkway exit31—the Meadowbrook State Parkway's northern terminus—would not lead to environmental disruption. In August 1998, the Meadowbrook was dedicated as the Senator Norman J. Levy Memorial Parkway in honor of Norman J. Levy, a state senator who helped sponsor the first seat belt law in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The {{study of}} the Hungarian {{language}} {{is one of the}} main sources of the research on the ethnogenesis of the Hungarian people because a language shows the circumstances of its own development and its contacts with other idioms. According to a scholarly theory, the oldest layers of Hungarian vocabulary show features of the territory in which the language emerged. The study of loan words from other languages is instrumental in determining direct contacts between the ancient speakers of the Hungarian language and other peoples. Loan words also reflect changes in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> of the Magyars.|$|E
5|$|Abovian's poetry {{was filled}} with satire best {{expressed}} in The wine jug, in which he criticized Russian bureaucracy. Leisure entertainment was adapted by Abovian from notes he took in public gatherings. The work {{is a collection of}} fables in verse that chastise vice, injustice and moral degeneration. He wrote scientific and artistic non-fiction works such as the Discovery of America and Book of Stories. Abovian translated to the Armenian language the works of Homer, Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Nikolay Karamzin, I. A. Krylov and others. He continued promoting secular and comprehensive (mental, moral, working, physical) training, school accessibility, free education for the indigent and equal education of boys and girls. Pedagogical compositions of Abovian include the book for reading Introduction to education (1838), a textbook of Russian grammar and an Armenian-language novel History of Tigran, or a moral manual for the Armenian children (printed in 1941). He was the first Armenian to study scientific ethnography: <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and customs of the peasants of the native settlements around Kanaker, inhabitants of Yerevan, and gathered and studied Armenian and Kurdish folklore.|$|E
5|$|In frogs, the {{hind legs}} {{are larger than}} the fore legs, {{especially}} so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming. In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large, and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies. The feet have adaptations for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> with webbing between the toes for swimming, broad adhesive toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging (frogs usually dig backwards into the soil). In most salamanders, the limbs are short and {{more or less the}} same length and project at right angles from the body. Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing. In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish. Some salamanders in the genus Aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails. In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles, the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion. Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, Skagen {{became the}} summer venue of a group of artists who were {{attracted}} by <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in the fishing village and by the opportunities for painting the fishermen and surrounding landscapes. Skagens Museum was founded on 20 October 1908 in the dining room at Brøndums Hotel. Among the founders were artists Michael Ancher, P.S. Krøyer and Laurits Tuxen, who were elected to form the first board of governors together with Victor Christian Klæbel, the local pharmacist, and Degn Brøndum, who was the proprietor of Brøndums Hotel and brother of Anna Ancher. In 1982, the exhibition rooms were extended with an annex designed by the Royal Surveyor, architect Jacob Blegvad. Blegvad also planned the later extension to the museum that was inaugurated in 1989. Today Skagens Museum has more than 1,900 works of art at its disposal.|$|E
5|$|Within the Australian {{region in}} the Southern Hemisphere between 90°E– 160°E, a {{tropical}} cyclone is named when observations or Dvorak intensity analysis indicate that a system has gale force or stronger winds near the center which are forecast to continue. The Indonesian Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika names systems that develop between the Equator and 10°S and 90°E and 141°E, while Papua New Guinea's National Weather Service names systems that develop between the Equator and 10°S and 141°E and 160°E. Outside of these areas, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology names systems that develop into tropical cyclones. If a name is assigned to a tropical cyclone that causes loss of life or significant damage and disruption to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> of a community, then the name assigned to that storm is retired {{from the list of}} names for the region. A replacement name is then submitted to the next World Meteorological Organization's RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee meeting.|$|E
5|$|Within the Southern Pacific basin in the Southern Hemisphere between 160°E– 120°W, a {{tropical}} cyclone is named when observations or Dvorak intensity analysis {{indicate that a}} system has gale force or stronger winds near the center which are forecast to continue. The Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) names systems that are located between the Equator and 25°S, while the New Zealand MetService names systems (in conjunction with the FMS) that develop {{to the south of}} 25°S. If {{a tropical}} cyclone causes loss of life or significant damage and disruption to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> of a community, then the name assigned to that cyclone is retired from the list of names for the region. A replacement name is then submitted to the next World Meteorological Organization's RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee meeting.
