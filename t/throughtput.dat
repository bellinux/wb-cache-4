40|$|Abstract. - This work explores ways {{to boost}} the {{spectral}} efficiency of transmission schemes based on amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperation. While AF has usually been considered to suffer from bandwidth expansion due to {{the increased use of}} transmission resources, in a multiuser environment it is possible to overcome this limitation by either spatially reusing the transmissions from different relay terminals, or by using multiple relays. These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive and are studied below in the context of TDMA transmissions for the downlink. It is shown that under mild assumptions the interference generated during the relay transmission phases can be statistically modeled. The outage events generated by this interference are mitigated by an adaptive transmission rate scheme that maximizes the system <b>throughtput.</b> This low complex implementation of multiuser AF provides significant throughput gains over a conventional TDMA non-cooperative scenario.

40|$|International audienceIn {{wireless}} networks, {{providing a}} fair bandwidth allocation {{without too much}} reducing the system throughput is very challenging. Path loss attenuations induce unequal spectral efficiencies and in terms unequal <b>throughtput</b> for mobiles with different geographical positions. In the litterature, Proportional Fair (PF) is acknowledged as the reference scheduler in multiuser OFDM wireless networks. Opportunistically considering the channel state, PF is adapted to the wireless environment fighting the multipath fading negative effects. PF takes advantage of multiuser diversity and globally maximizes the throughput. Additionally, PF scheduling currently makes the best tradeoff between fairness and throughput maximization. However, severe fairness deficiencies appear when the mobiles experience unequal path loss. In this paper, we propose to solve this fairness issue with a modified PF scheme that introduces distance compensation factors. Simulation results show that this well-balanced resource allocation outperforms other existing scheduling schemes and jointly provides both high system throughput and high fairness...|$|E

30|$|In our timing estimates, {{we assume}} {{sequential}} (i.e., single-threaded) implementations {{of the user}} and server sides of the protocol that run on a single core. On the other hand, one advantage of the proposed system from the time complexity {{point of view is}} that majority of the expensive operations (i.e., mainly modular exponentiations) can be performed in parallel. Therefore, custom ASIC [81] or GPU implementations [82] can accelerate protocol considerably. For instance, the custom modular exponentiation circuit for RSA in [81] reports 0.89 ms execution time on a circuit of 153, 000 equivalent gate counts. With specialized hardware that incorporates many custom modular exponentiation modules, overall execution time can be reduced significantly. Similarly, a GPU implementation is reported [82] to reach the peak <b>throughtput</b> of 34, 981 RSA- 1024 decryptions per second with 2.6 ms latency. Apparently, a parallel GPU implementation of modular exponentiation will trivialize the computation complexity of the proposed technique. Finally, we expect an acceleration proportional to the number of cores if the protocol is implemented on a multi-core CPU platform.|$|E

40|$|In {{addressing}} the issue of achieving high throughput in half-duplex relay channels, we exploit a concept of information-guided transmission for the network consisting of a source node, a destination node, and multiple half-duplex relay nodes. For further benefiting from multiple relay nodes, the relay-selection patterns are defined as the arbitrary combinations of given relay nodes. By exploiting the difference among the spatial channels states, in each relay-help transmission additional information to be forwarded is mapped onto the index of the active relay-selection pattern besides the basic information mapped onto the traditional constellation, which is forwarded by the relay node(s) in the active relay-selection pattern, so as to enhance the relay <b>throughtput.</b> With iterative decoding, the destination node can achieve a robust detection by decoupling the signals forwarded in different ways.

40|$|We {{intend to}} {{introduce}} a new application layer multicast with congestion control. Before looking at this challenging task, we discussed the multicast service models and analysed major contributions to multicast congestion control. We focused on the specificities of congestion control {{in the context of}} Source Specific Multicast (SSM) and Application Layer Multicast (ALM). This permitted us to point out keys mechanisms that enable an e#cient congestion control and to fix some guidelines that will drive the conception of our scheme. We designed and implemented a new application layer multicast protocol with congestion control capabilities. The protocol rely on a two [...] tier architecture where core components, called SCP (Service Control Point) lay between the sender and the session members and o#er the main multicast function. The SCP are responsible of establishing the data path from any receiver.

Recently, authors have demonstrated a 'label-free' detection of DNA hybridization {{based on the}} absorption variation in the ultra-violet (UV) range using hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) /amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC:H) UV sensor. To increase the <b>throughtput</b> of the biochemical analysis, in this work we present the design and fabrication of a 16 x 16 UV sensor array, deposited by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition on a glass substrate. Each pixel is constituted by two back-to-back series connected coplanar n-i-p diodes. One n-i-p diode acts as UV sensor (with 1. 4 x 1. 8 mm 2 area) and the other as switching diode (with 200 x 200 m 2 area). The whole structure is the following: glass substrate/metal/n-type a-Si:H/intrinsic a-Si:H/p-type a-SiC:H/metal. The top electrode is a grid metal layer to allow transmission of the incident radiation into the active layer of the device.

40|$|Quality of Service (QoS) in {{real-time}} media applications can {{be defined}} as the ability to guarantee the delivery of packets from source to destination over best-effort networks within some constraints. These constraints defined as the QoS metrics are end-to-end packet delay, delay jitter, <b>throughtput,</b> and packet losses. Transporting real-time media applications over best-effort networks, e. g. the Internet, is an area of current research. Both the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) have failed to provide the desired QoS. This research aims at developing application-level end-to-end QoS controls to improve the user-perceived quality of real-time media applications over best-effort networks, such as, the public Internet. In this research an end-to-end packet based approach is developed. The end-to- end packet based approach consists of source buffer, network simulator ns- 2, destina- tion buffer, and controller. Unconstrained model predictive control (MPC) methods are implemented by the controller at the application layer. The end-to-end packet based approach uses end-to-end network measurements and predictions as feedback signals. Effectiveness of the developed control methods are examined using Matlab and ns- 2. The results demonstrate that sender-based control schemes utilizing UDP at transport layer are effective in providing QoS for real-time media applications transported over best-effort networks. Significant improvements in providing QoS are visible by the reduction of packet losses and the elimination of disruptions during the playback of real-time media. This is accompanied by either a decrease or increase in the playback start-time...|$|E
40|$|In {{wireless}} multihop networks each node {{acts as a}} relay for {{the other}} nodes. Consequently, {{the distribution of the}} traffic load has a strong spatial dependence. We consider a dense multihop network where the routes are approximately straight line segments. To this end we introduce the so-called line segment traversing process which defines the movement of points in a given region. In particular, the points move along the line segments with a spatial velocity which depends on the current location of the point. We use this process to model the movement of packets and utilise its properties to study the relayed traffic load which corresponds to the traffic load experienced by a node in a given location, and to study the queueing delays {{as a function of the}} location using the spatial velocity of the line segment process. The efficiency of a wireless multihop network depends significantly on the used MAC protocol, which then has an impact on queueing delays in a congested network. Our model can be adapted to any given MAC protocol by a proper choice of the spatial velocity. Additionally, from the model we also obtain an expression for the mean one-way delay in the network, which is itself an important performance measure of the network. Finally, we use ns 2 -simulations to validate some of the key ideas, along with several numerical examples illustrating the effects of MAC protocols on the mean end-to-end delay and power (ratio of <b>throughtput</b> to mean delay).

V. salmonicidas virulence is regulated by Quorum sensing (QS) systems, which includes important regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs). sRNAs {{have the last}} years been identified in large numbers, and mostly in pathogenic bacteria strains. A cDNA library from small RNA species (120 - 340 nt) was constructed by size fractionation on a polyacrylamide gel.

More colonies need to be screened in order to decide whether the cDNA library can be used in further studies or not. One sRNA proven to be very important in QS in several Vibrios is the quorum regulating RNA (Qrr). The expression of qrr has earlier been confirmed by Northern blotting. Furthermore, V. salmonicida has got only one predicted Qrr encoding gene, while other Vibrios have several. In order to gain more information about the role of Qrr in V. salmonicida, the construction of a qrr knock-out by deletion mutant was initiated.
