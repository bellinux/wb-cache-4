50|$|Vampire bats are {{sensitive}} to power densities (a measure of emitted energy) greater than 50 µW/cm2 at distances between 13 and 16 cm (a power density of 1.8x10−4W/cm2 corresponds to 50 °C). This was first determined by quantifying the temperature at which vampire bats could not behaviorally distinguish between heat emitting and room temperature SUs. A positive linear relationship exists between the energy-threshold of heat detection and distance from stimuli. Through mathematical calculations, {{at a distance of}} 8 cm, vampire bats should be able to detect humans who emit radiation of 80 µW/cm2. Temperature threshold measurements were directly measured by stimulating nerve fibers of thermoreceptors in the nose-leaf and upper lip with a water-circulated brass <b>thermode</b> and recording the impulses/second at every 5 °C shift in temperature from 10 to 40 °C. These receptors have a threshold of 28 °C and a maximum temperature response to 40 °C, beyond which there was either no firing or an irregular firing pattern. This threshold is 8 °C lower compared to those of warm receptor in other species of mammals, which implies extreme sensitivity to heat. After stimulation of these receptors, there is a transient increase in impulse activity which quickly decays due to adaptation and thus strengthens temporal acuity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{soldering}} of small, delicate {{electronic devices}} {{by means of}} a blade <b>thermode</b> (a small, thin, rectangular- or-shaped soldering iron) requires the lower side of the <b>thermode</b> to have a uniform temperature distribution. This is not easily obtained: during start-up the corners tend to be too hot, and too cold in the stationary phase. In the present study the various aspects that determine the heat flow and the temperature distribution are analysed, both for the dynamic and the stationary cases. For a temperature-independent (linear) material, approximate solutions are obtained for the dynamic problem. For the stationary problem, an exact solution is utilized that includes temperature-dependent (nonlinear) material. Practical design rules based on these solutions are proposed. The analysis compares very well with a numerical finite-element simulation...|$|E
40|$|Reduction {{from a more}} to a less noxious {{stimulus}} intensity {{produces a}} disproportionate but transient decrease in perceived pain. Although {{the relationship between the}} central nervous system and this offset analgesia has come under investigation using brain imaging, whether offset analgesia is primarily mediated by central rather than peripheral mechanisms has not been established. Here we investigate this question in healthy volunteers using thermal stimuli while recording continuous pain ratings. We constructed a composite stimulus using one Peltier <b>thermode</b> to deliver a constant painful test stimulus while a separate <b>thermode</b> coincidentally delivered a shorter but more intense conditioning stimulus at a distinct location. Three spatial configurations were investigated all delivering stimulation to the ventral forearm either proximally or distally from one another on the same forearm or with thermodes on opposing forearms. We demonstrate a decrease in test stimulus pain levels following offset of an ipsilateral but not contralateral conditioning stimulus. This decrease is comparable in magnitude to that observed during a single <b>thermode</b> classic offset analgesia stimulation. The manifestation of analgesia in one sensory field following cessation of stimulation in a distinct sensory field shows antinociceptive adaptation of primary afferent neurons is unnecessary to produce offset analgesia, and demonstrates central mechanisms are sufficient to achieve temporal filtering of nociceptive information during stimulus offset. 2017 - 08 - 0...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{compared}} the metabolic responses to selective cooling of the cervical (Cp-Thj) and the thoracic (Thi-Ths) parts of the spinal cord of pigeons. To obtain selective cooling of the two parts, two <b>thermodes</b> (4. 5 cm) were inserted into the vertebral canal through an aperture in the first thoracic vertebra. During the experiments, {{one of the two}} <b>thermodes</b> was perfused with water at a constant temperature for periods of 15 min. The thermosensitivity was denned as the relationship between the amount of extra heat produced and the amount of heat extracted from the stimulated area. Cooling of the thoracic part resulted in a substantially higher increase in metabolic heat production and body temperature (Tb) than did cooling of the cervical part. It is concluded that the thoracic part of the spinal cord has a greater thermosensitivity than the cervical part. In addition, {{it was found that the}} difference in elevation of Tb during cooling of the two parts was not simply a result of differences in the amount of heat produced. When the changes in Tb were related to the difference between the extra heat produced and the amount of heat extracted, the increase in Tb during thoracic cooling was greater than that recorded during cervical cooling. This indicates that cooling of the two different parts of the spinal cord also had different effects on the thermoregulatory effector mechanisms that influence thermal conductance. The study seems to provide evidence in favour of afferent transmission of cold signals in the spinal cord...|$|R

40|$|A {{problem in}} {{assessing}} pain sensitivity in animals is the variability among individuals within a species. Thermal nociceptive threshold (TNT) testing {{is used to}} measure pain sensitivity in animals. However, {{little research has been}} done on within species differences in pain sensitivity, with most studies focusing on the effectiveness of analgesics. This research was carried out {{to see if there was}} any variation in baseline TNTs in different dog breeds. To determine TNTs, a heat stimulus was applied to the leg of a dog using a new device that could be remotely activated. This removed the need to restrain the dogs. The time and temperature at which the dog responded behaviourally was recorded. The TNT of dog was recorded six times in a one-hour session, once a week, for four consecutive weeks. In the first experiment the repeatability of harrier hound (n= 11) TNTs over time and the effects of the initial <b>thermode</b> temperature were examined. The results indicated that TNTs were repeatable over the daily test, session however they were affected by week of testing, <b>thermode</b> and initial <b>thermode</b> temperature. It was concluded that using a consistent elevated initial <b>thermode</b> temperature was more consistent than the natural starting temperature. The aim of the second experiment was to investigate differences in TNTs between three dog breeds: harrier hounds, greyhounds, and huntaways (n= 10 per breed). A breed effect was found whereby huntaways took significantly longer to respond than harrier hounds and responded at higher temperatures than greyhounds and harrier hounds. There were no differences between greyhounds and harrier hounds. This study provides the first scientific evidence of breed differences in pain sensitivity in dogs. It is concluded that there were differences in thermal pain thresholds between the three dog breeds tested. The study supported the use of TNT testing on dogs and offered new insight into ways to improve the reliability of threshold testing. Future work should use more breeds, evaluate pain sensitivity in other modalities, and assess the effect of analgesics on TNTs in dogs...|$|E

Material and Methods: Thirty healthy individuals (15 females and 15 males), mean age 24. 9 years, range 20 - 31 years) participated in the study. Thresholds for warm detection (WDT), cool detection (CDT) and heat pain threshold (HPT) were measured using a thermotester (MSA–Modular sensory Analyzer, Somedic). The intraoral <b>thermode</b> was custom-made with a 9 x 9 mm square surface. The average of three measurements was recorded. Four intraoral sites (gingival regions 24 and 34, tip of the tongue, lower lip) and two extraoral sites (infraorbitalis, thenar) were measured in each participant. To measure spatial summation, five acrylic covers (tip areas: 0. 81 cm 2, 0. 50 cm 2, 0. 28 cm 2, 0. 125 cm 2, 0 cm 2) were made to fit the <b>thermode.</b> Five measurements {{on the tip of}} the tongue were averaged for each acrylic cover. Results: Of the extraoral sites, the cold detection threshold was significantly higher and the heat pain threshold was significantly lower at the infraorbitalis than at the thenar.

40|$|The febrile {{responses}} of Sprague-Dawley rats to semi-purified human endogenous pyrogen were studied at a thermoneutral ambient temperature (26 degrees C) {{and in the}} cold (3 degrees C). It was found that while rats developed typical monophasic febrile responses at thermoneutrality, febrile responses were absent in the cold-exposed rats. Experiments were conducted to determine whether this lack of febrile responses in cold-exposed rats was due to an inability of these animals to generate or retain heat in the cold. Thermogenesis and vasoconstriction were stimulated in cold-exposed rats by selectively cooling the hypothalamus, using chronically implanted <b>thermodes.</b> It was shown that, using this stimulus, metabolic rate could be {{increased by more than}} 50 percent and body temperature could be driven up at a rate of 5 degrees C/hour in rats exposed to the cold.

40|$|Pain is {{a serious}} medical problem; it inflicts huge {{economic}} loss and personal suffering. Pain signals are conducted via small, non- and partially myelinated A-delta and C nerve fibers and lasers are particularly well suited to stimulating these fibers. Large myelinated fibers convey touch and vibration information and these fibers are also discharged when contact <b>thermodes</b> and other touch pain stimuli are used and this would give a more muddled signal for functional imaging experiments. The advantages of lasers over conventional methods of pain stimulation are good temporal resolution, no variable parameters are involved such as contact area and they give very reproducible results.

The stimulator is used in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and electrophysiological methods of imaging the brain's activity. This combination is a powerful tool for the study of pain-induced activity in different areas of the brain.

40|$|International audienceReducing the heart's {{temperature}} by 2 - 5 °C is {{a potent}} cardioprotective treatment in animal models of coronary artery occlusion. The anti-infarct benefit depends upon the target temperature and the time at which cooling is instituted. Protection primarily results from cooling during the ischaemic period, whereas cooling during reperfusion or beyond offers little protection. In animal studies, protection is proportional to both the depth and duration of cooling. An optimal cooling protocol must appreciably shorten the normothermic ischaemic time to effectively salvage myocardium. Patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction could be candidates for mild hypothermia since the current door-to-balloon time is typically 90 min. But {{they would have to}} be cooled quickly shortly after their arrival. Several strategies have been proposed for ultra-fast cooling, but most like liquid ventilation and pericardial perfusion are too invasive. More feasible strategies might include cutaneous cooling, peritoneal lavage with cold solutions, and endovascular cooling with intravenous <b>thermodes.</b> This last option has been investigated clinically, but the results have been disappointing possibly because the devices lacked capacity to cool the patient quickly or cooling was not implemented soon enough. The mechanism of hypothermia's protection has been assumed to be energy conservation. However, whereas deep hypothermia clearly preserves ATP, mild hypothermia has only a modest effect on ATP depletion during ischaemia. Some evidence suggests that intracellular signalling pathways might be responsible for the protection. It is unknown how cooling could trigger these pathways, but, if true, then {{it might be possible to}} duplicate cooling's protection pharmacologically...|$|R

40|$|Hypoxia is {{well known}} to reduce the body {{temperature}} (Tb) of mammals, although the neural origins of this response remain uncertain. Short-term hypoxic exposure causes {{a reduction in the}} lower critical temperature of the thermal neutral zone and a reduction in whole body thermal conductance of rodents, providing indirect support that hypoxia lowers Tb in a regulated manner. In this study, we examined directly the potential for changes in central thermosensitivity to evoke the hypoxic metabolic response by heating and cooling the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (the area which integrates thermoreceptor input and regulates thermoeffector outputs) using chronic, indwelling <b>thermodes</b> in ground squirrels during normoxia and hypoxia (7, 10 and 12 % O 2). We found that the threshold hypothalamic temperature for the metabolic response to cooling (Tth) of ∼ 38 °C in normoxia was proportionately reduced in hypoxia (down to 28 – 31 °C at 7 % O 2) and that the metabolic thermosensitivity (α; the change in metabolic rate for any given change in hypothalamic temperature below the lower critical temperature) was comparatively reduced by 5 to 9 times. This provides strong support for the hypothesis that the fall in temperature that occurs during hypoxia {{is the result of a}} reduction in the activation of thermogenic mechanisms. The decrease in the central thermosensitivity in hypoxia, however, appears to be a critical factor in the alteration of mammalian Tb. We suggest, therefore, that an altered central thermosensitivity may provide a proximate explanation of how low oxygen and similar stressors reduce normal fluctuations in Tb (i. e. circadian), in addition to the depression in regulated Tb...|$|R

Three different concentrations of EDLA were tested (6. 25, 12. 5, and 25 mg/mL), with 6 subjects in each group.

Estimates of psychophysical magnitude showed that when four identical heat pulses were applied to the same spot on the hand (interstimulus interval ≤ 80 sec), the first pain progressively decreased in perceived intensity whereas the second pain increased with interstimulus intervals of 3 sec or less.

Identical trains of noxious heat pulses partially suppressed the responses of Aδ and of C nociceptive afferents.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to estimate and compare nerve conduction velocity (NCV) of cutaneous heat-sensitive C-fibres obtained using two methods. The first is a method based on reaction times to different rates of temperature change produced by a large contact <b>thermode</b> (Thermotest). The second is a novel method based on ultra-late-evoked brain potentials to CO 2 laser stimuli with tiny beam sections (< 0. 25 mm 2), allowing selective and direct activation of very slow conducting afferents. Both methods were applied on three sites of the right leg (foot, knee and thigh) of ten healthy subjects. When based on the reaction times to contact heat, NCV estimations were 0. 4 +/- 0. 22 m/s for the proximal segment (knee-thigh) and 0. 6 +/- 0. 23 m/s for the distal segment (foot-knee). When based on the difference in latency of the ultra-late positivity of laser-evoked brain potentials, NCV estimations were respectively 1. 4 +/- 0. 77 m/s and 1. 2 +/- 0. 55 m/s. For both methods, the difference in NCV between proximal and distal limb segments was not significant. Although both methods give NCV estimations within the range of C-fibres, the systematic difference between NCV obtained from each method may result from the activation of subpopulations of C-fibres with different NCV depending on the method of stimulation (low-threshold thermal receptors by the <b>thermode</b> and thermal nociceptors by the CO 2 laser). Considering the difficulty of investigating peripheral fibres with slow conduction velocities (C-fibres) in humans, the methods {{used in the present study}} may be useful tools in both experimental and clinical situations...|$|E

40|$|Heterotopic noxious {{conditioning}} stimulation (HNCS) {{has been}} thought to give {{access to the}} diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) in man, which can be activated in wide-dynamic- range neurons by noxious stimulation from remote areas {{of the body and}} form the neurophysiological basis of the phenomenon ''pain inhibits pain''. The latter phenomenon suggests that the subjective experience of pain is a prerequisite for an inhibitory action. The necessity of using painful stimuli as conditioning and as test stimuli to produce inhibitory effects was investigated in the present study, using a HNCS paradigm. Twenty young men received conditioning stimuli created by tonic heat at painful and non-painful levels, using either hot water (hand) or <b>thermode</b> (forearm). The test stimuli were phasic heat stimuli (<b>thermode)</b> at painful and non-painful levels applied to the cheek. Only painful but not non-painful heat as conditioning stimulus increased the heat pain threshold and decreased the ability to discriminate between painful heat of different intensities. These two findings are in accord with an inhibitory effect depending on a painful conditioning stimulus. However, the intensity ratings of the test stimuli indicated inhibitory effects of the conditioning stimuli also upon non- painful levels. Furthermore, non-painful heat as conditioning stimulus also appeared to be capable of decreasing the ratings of the test stimuli at painful levels. The latter two findings suggest: (i) that very strong but subjectively still non- painful stimulation can trigger pain inhibitory effects and (ii) that also subjectively non-painful stimuli are affected by inhibitory influences during HNCS.

40|$|Quantitative {{sensory testing}} (QST) {{is defined as}} the {{determination}} of thresholds for sensory perception under controlled stimulus. Our aim was to validate a new QST device for Brazilian sample. In 20 healthy adults, thermoalgesic thresholds were assessed using a QST prototype (Heat Pain Stimulator- 1. 1. 10; Brazil). A 30 × 30 mm² <b>thermode</b> with a 1 °C/s stimulus change rate were applied. Thresholds of three consecutive stimuli were averaged in two different sessions separated by at least two weeks. Additionally long thermal heat pain stimulus was performed. To evaluate the consistency of our method we also analyzed 11 patients with small fiber neuropathy. Results showed good reproducibility of thermal perception thresholds in normal individuals and plausible abnormal thresholds in patients. We conclude that our QST device is reliable when analyzing the nociceptive pathway in controls and patients...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS A {{quantitative}} {{method for}} the examination ofthermal sensibility was applied in 26 normal subjects and {{in patients with}} various neurological disorders. The stimulation technique resembled Bekesy audiometry: the patient reversed {{the direction of the}} temperature change of a <b>thermode</b> when-ever warm, cold, or thermal pain thresholds were reached. The resulting temperature curve enables a quantitative description of the subject's thermal sensibility and of the degree of impairment displayed by neurological patients. It is well known that a disturbance of the temperature sense occurs in many neurological patients as a con-sequence of lesions in the peripheral or central ner-vous system. It usually occurs together with a disturbance of other sensory modalities such as cutaneous pain, but it may also appear separately (Goldscheider, 1926). For a closer study of changes in thermal sensibility, a quantitative technique is necessary which allow...|$|E
