5|$|In 1907, Willson {{was chosen}} by acclamation as the Republican {{candidate}} for governor. Willson's opponent had been chosen at a nominating convention two years earlier. Governor Beckham had convinced the Democrats to hold their primary early so he could secure the party's nomination for the 1908 senatorial election {{while he was still}} serving as governor. Further, he wanted to influence <b>the</b> <b>selection</b> of his would-be successor. Using his clout as governor, he assured <b>the</b> <b>selection</b> of Samuel Wilbur Hager as the party's gubernatorial nominee.|$|E

5|$|Leeman Bennett, {{the former}} {{head coach of the}} Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, served as {{chairman}} of <b>the</b> <b>selection</b> committee, which had the task of picking the best teams from those made available by <b>the</b> <b>selection</b> criteria set by the two conferences. The committee would have approximately onemonth to select the twoteams that would attract the most people to the game and generate the largest possible television audience. This fact helped eliminate ACC runner-up Georgia Tech from <b>the</b> <b>selection</b> process, as the Yellow Jackets had already played Georgia earlier in the season, thus making a potential Georgia-Georgia Tech showdown less attractive. In addition, that matchup, while attractive to football fans in the Atlanta area (the site of the Chick-fil-A Bowl and home to Georgia Tech), would have less appeal to television viewers outside the Georgia area. Supervising <b>the</b> <b>selection</b> committee was the Chick-fil-A Bowl Executive Committee, which consisted of representatives from various Atlanta businesses and the Chick-fil-A corporation.|$|E

5|$|Notwithstanding {{the level}} of {{controversy}} surrounding cost, the Scottish Parliament Building proved controversial {{in a number of}} other respects: the decision to construct a new building, the choice of site, <b>the</b> <b>selection</b> of a non-Scottish architect, and <b>the</b> <b>selection</b> of Bovis as construction manager after having earlier been excluded from the shortlist. In 1997, the initial cost of constructing a new Parliament building was given as £40 million, a figure produced by the Scottish Office, prior to the September 1997 devolution referendum, and subsequently revealed to be the figure for housing MSPs. Further controversy surrounding the project sprang from <b>the</b> <b>selection</b> of the Holyrood site, which was a late entrant onto the list of sites to be considered, and the rejection of the Royal High School on Calton Hill, long thought to be the home of any future devolved Scottish Parliament. After a formal visit to the Royal High School by Dewar and his aides on 30 May 1997, it was rejected as unsuitable on the grounds of size and location.|$|E

President Juvenal Juvencio said the region had no city structures, hospitals or hotels; {{the only way to}} enter or leave the area would be to use a fire engine {{and that there was no}} way to create a VIP area around the stadium. Juvenal blamed ex-governor José Serra for Morumbi Stadium's deselection. Serra denied the accusations.|$|E
