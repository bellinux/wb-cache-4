5|$|Anxious {{for their}} safety Kirill and Victoria decided that the best <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to leave Russia. They chose Finland as the best {{possible}} place to go. Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, {{so in a way}} it would be like being in Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them. They sewed jewels into the family's clothing, hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted to board a train without incident {{in the first week of}} June 1917.|$|E

25|$|La Luz was {{eventually}} {{expelled from the}} Puerto Rico Socialist Party because his ideals no longer aligned with the organization. Labeled a “Social Democrat” instead of being primarily nationalist, La Luz decided instead to become active in Democratic Party politics. He also began a career as an organizer for several unions, which sought to organize the growing Hispanic workforce in the low wage manufacturing and service sectors. For him, it had become clear {{that the most important}} <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> {{to improve the lives of}} people who needed basic rights.|$|E

500|$|After {{failing to}} capture the Republican presidential nomination, Foraker {{concentrated}} on campaigning for re-election to the Senate. [...] His vote on the Hepburn Act and his opposition to Roosevelt had provoked opposition to him within the Ohio Republican Party; in addition, both he and Dick were seen by some as {{the face of the}} old guard of the party, out of place in the Progressive Era. [...] Many of those who opposed him proposed Congressman Theodore E. Burton for the Senate seat; Foraker stated that the first <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> secure a Republican legislature, with the question of who should be senator left until victory was obtained.|$|E
500|$|With {{a modest}} income secured, Holst {{was able to}} marry Isobel; the {{ceremony}} was at Fulham Register Office on 22 June 1901. Their marriage lasted until his death; there was one child, Imogen, born in 1907. In 1902 Dan Godfrey and the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra premiered Holst's symphony The Cotswolds (Op. 8), the slow movement {{of which is a}} lament for William Morris who had died in October 1896, three years before Holst began work on the piece. In 1903 Adolph von Holst died, leaving a small legacy. Holst and his wife decided, as Imogen later put it, that [...] "as they were always hard up the only <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to spend it all at once on a holiday in Germany".|$|E
500|$|In February 1890 Nansen {{addressed}} {{a meeting of}} the Norwegian Geographical Society in Oslo (then called Christiania). After drawing attention to the failures of the many expeditions which had approached the North Pole from the west, he considered the implications of the discovery of the Jeannette items, along with further finds of driftwood and other debris from Siberia or Alaska that had been identified along the Greenland coast. [...] "Putting all this together," [...] Nansen said, [...] "we are driven to the conclusion that a current flows ... from the Siberian Arctic Sea to the east coast of Greenland," [...] probably passing across the Pole. It seemed that the obvious <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> [...] "to make our way into the current {{on that side of the}} Pole where it flows northward, and by its help to penetrate into those regions which all who have hitherto worked against [...] have sought in vain to reach." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1961, a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 {{minicomputer}} was installed in the [...] "kludge room" [...] of the MIT Electrical Engineering Department to complement the older TX-0, and even before its arrival {{a group of students}} and university employees had been brainstorming ideas for programs that would demonstrate the new computer's capabilities in a compelling way. Three of them—Steve Russell, then an employee at Harvard University and a former research assistant at MIT; Martin Graetz, a research assistant and former student at MIT; and Wayne Wiitanen, a research assistant at Harvard and former employee and student at MIT—referring to their collaboration as the [...] "Hingham Institute" [...] as Graetz and Wiitanen were living in a tenement building on Hingham Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, {{came up with the idea}} for Spacewar. [...] "We had this brand new PDP-1", Steve Russell told Rolling Stone in a 1972 interview. [...] "Marvin Minsky had built some little pattern-generating programs which made interesting patterns like a kaleidoscope. Not a very good demonstration. Here was this display that could do all sorts of good things! So we started talking about it, figuring what would be interesting displays. We decided that probably you could make a two-dimensional maneuvering sort of thing, and decided that naturally the obvious <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> spaceships." ...|$|E
500|$|When Amin became leader, {{he tried}} to reduce Afghanistan's {{dependence}} on the Soviet Union. To accomplish this, he aimed to balance Afghanistan's relations with the Soviet Union by strengthening relations with Pakistan and Iran. The Soviets were concerned when they received reports that Amin had met personally with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, {{one of the leading}} anti-communists in Afghanistan. His general untrustworthiness and his unpopularity amongst Afghans made it more difficult for Amin to find new [...] "foreign patrons". Amin's involvement in the death of Adolph Dubs, the American Ambassador to Afghanistan, strained his relations with the United States. He tried to improve relations by reestablishing contact, met with three different American chargé d'affaires, and was interviewed by an American correspondent. But this did not improve Afghanistan's standing {{in the eyes of the}} United States Government. After the third meeting with Amin, J. Bruce Amstutz, the American Ambassador to Afghanistan from 1979 to 1980, believed the wisest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to maintain [...] "a low profile, trying to avoid issues, and waiting to see what happens". In early December 1979, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed a joint summit meeting between Amin and Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the President of Pakistan. The Pakistani Government, accepting a modified version of the offer, agreed to send Agha Shahi, the Pakistani foreign minister, to Kabul for talks. In the meanwhile, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistani's secret police, continued to train Mujahideen fighters who opposed the communist regime.|$|E
2500|$|A {{military}} confrontation on 31March 1904 {{became known as}} the Massacre of Chumik Shenko. Facing the vanguard of Macdonald's army and blocking the road was a Tibetan force of 3,000 armed with antiquated matchlock muskets, ensconced behind a [...] rock wall. On the slope above, the Tibetans had placed seven or eight sangars. The Commissioner, Younghusband, was asked to stop but replied that the advance must continue, and that he could not allow any Tibetan troops to remain on the road. The Tibetans would not fight, but nor would they vacate their positions. Younghusband and Macdonald agreed that [...] "the only <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to disarm them and let them go". This at least was the official version. The writer Charles Allen has also suggested that a dummy attack was played out in an effort to provoke the Tibetans into opening fire.|$|E

2500|$|The stories {{published}} under Weisinger {{remained the}} basis for Superman's origin throughout the Bronze Age. But by the time Julius Schwartz took over as {{the editor of the}} Superman in 1970, continuity had strayed from the broader outline established in the 1960s. Schwartz relied on writer E. Nelson Bridwell, an expert in the fine details of the Superman mythology, to help refine the character's history. Bridwell explained to readers that many stories were no longer in continuity because they contradicted others, stating that, [...] "It was decided that the only <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to throw out part of the tales and work the rest into a consistent whole". Superman's origin was retold during this time in The Amazing World of Superman (Metropolis Edition), which adhered to the origin previously established in the Silver Age. Martin Pasko wrote Action Comics #500 (October 1979), which featured a history of the Superman canon as it existed at the time and was published in the Dollar Comics format.|$|E
2500|$|After reluctantly {{giving in}} to his record label's request to make the album a Kid Creole and the Coconuts record rather than a solo album, Darnell felt the most {{appropriate}} <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to continue {{the concept of the}} first two Kid Creole albums, about the adventures of the band shipwrecked on the imaginary island of B'Dilli Bay. Darnell told NME about the album's theme, and also explained away the change of musical style from the first two albums, saying, [...] "What this album is, is a continuation of the Fresh Fruit... idea. Only it's a flashback, it all takes place on B'Dilli Bay... It's a flashback story of what exactly happened for the 21 days that Creole and his crew stayed on that island, with the scum of the earth, the prostitutes, whores and pimps... Creole is on B'Dilli Bay looking for Mimi and he had to spend time there, he had to buy his time there. Because the music of B'Dilli Bay was R And Creole was forced to play the music to stay there." ...|$|E

Next thing I knew, {{there was this}} chap in the long grass beside me. A bloody bundle, shrapnel-ripped, legless, one arm only. The one arm reached out to me, white eyeballs wide, unseeing, in the bloody mask {{that had been a}} face. A gurgling voice said, [...] "Help. Kill me." [...] With shaking hands I reached for my small pouch to load my revolver... I had to look for my bullets—by which time somebody else had already taken care of him. I heard the shot. I still remember that gurgling sound. A voice pleading for death....During the war I saw more wounded men being [...] "taken care of" [...] than I saw being rescued. Because sometimes you were too far from a dressing station, sometimes you couldn't get them out. And they were pumping blood or whatever; they were in such a wreck, the only <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to shoot them. And they were, so don't think they weren't.
