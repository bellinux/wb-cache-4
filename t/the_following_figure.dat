25|$|One {{can find}} a factor-2 {{approximation}} by repeatedly taking both endpoints of an edge into the vertex cover, then removing them from the graph. Put otherwise, we find a maximal matching M with a greedy algorithm and construct a vertex cover C that consists of all endpoints of the edges in M.

25|$|Actually, {{fractional}} Fourier transform is {{a rotation}} operation {{on the time}} frequency distribution. From the definition above, for α=0, {{there will be no}} change after applying fractional Fourier transform, and for α=π/2, fractional Fourier transform becomes a Fourier transform, which rotates the time frequency distribution withπ/2. For other value ofα, fractional Fourier transform rotates the time frequency distribution according to α. <b>The</b> <b>following</b> <b>figure</b> shows the results of the fractional Fourier transform with different values ofα.|$|E

In <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>figure</b> one can see the election results of the provincial election of 2007 per province. It shows the areas where GreenLeft is strong, namely the urban areas like North Holland and Utrecht. The party is weaker in rural provinces like Friesland and Zeeland, but also strong in rural Groningen, where the Communist Party of the Netherlands, one of the founding parties of GreenLeft was very strong.|$|E
