5000|$|In January of 1978, Doman {{returned}} to Connecticut as Chief Systems Engineer {{of the wind}} energy program at Hamilton Standard division of United Technologies. [...] Drawing on Doman’s extensive knowledge of rotor dynamics for both helicopters and wind turbines, United Technologies designed and built two of the largest wind turbines ever built {{up to that time}} (i.e. WTS-3, WTS-4). [...] Key features of those turbines, in addition to their size, were the use of only two blades (instead of three, which is more common) and the mounting of the blades on a <b>teeter</b> <b>hinge</b> hub. [...] This was analogous to Doman’s use of the gimbaled hub on his helicopters, which had 4-bladed rotors. [...] One turbine (WTS-4) was installed and successfully tested at Medicine Bow, Wyoming, and the other (WTS-3) in Sweden. [...] The WTS-4 wind turbine held the world power output record for over 20 years. [...] Throughout all the research studies and the testing of the actual turbines, there was rapid evolution in Doman’s thinking on the best design concepts. [...] However, when oil prices plummeted in the mid-1980s, United Technologies deemed the wind energy market to be uneconomical and halted the program.The Italian government took notice of Doman’s work, and in July of 1987, when Doman retired from United Technologies, he was hired by Aeritalia (the Italian manufacturer later known as Alenia) and moved to Rome to head Italy’s wind energy program. [...] In this program, Doman applied his latest thinking to a new machine, considerably improved over the WTS-4 and WTS-3 machines he had designed for installation in Wyoming and Sweden respectively. [...] Under Doman’s leadership a team of Italian engineers designed the Gamma 60 turbine. [...] The Gamma 60 was the world's first variable speed wind turbine with a <b>teeter</b> <b>hinge.</b> [...] Three Gamma 60 turbines were manufactured, and one was erected and successfully tested for 4 years on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia. [...] There had been intentions to build many more Gamma 60 turbines, but Italian politics and a lack of urgency due to relatively low oil prices in the 1990s resulted in the program being cancelled.|$|E
5000|$|In January of 1970, Doman went to {{work for}} Boeing Vertol - Boeing’s {{helicopter}} division in Philadelphia. [...] There he continued his helicopter pioneering, working on U.S. Army funded research and patenting additional design improvements for helicopter speed increases and vibration reductions. [...] The 1973 arab oil embargo triggered a great interest in wind energy at Boeing and numerous other companies. [...] While continuing his helicopter innovations, Doman began to conduct wind turbine research. [...] He adapted computer simulation models designed for helicopters to study wind turbines. [...] Doman and his team then built scale-model wind turbines to test them in a wind tunnel normally used for helicopters and airplanes. [...] Doman soon understood the similarities and key differences between wind turbines and helicopters. [...] Wind turbine designers with no experience in helicopters might not know the lessons-learned from the history of helicopter technology, but by the mid-1970s Doman had more than 30 years of such learning that was directly applicable to wind turbines. Boeing’s MOD-2 with the Doman-conceived flexible design, two-bladed wind turbine with a <b>teeter</b> <b>hinge,</b> became a flagship achievement in a 7-year NASA managed wind energy program for the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of the Interior.|$|E
50|$|The R22 is a light, two-place, single reciprocating-engined {{helicopter}} with a semi-rigid two-bladed {{main rotor}} and a two-bladed tail rotor. The main rotor has a <b>teetering</b> <b>hinge</b> and two coning hinges. The tail rotor {{has only a}} <b>teetering</b> <b>hinge.</b>|$|R
50|$|The semirigid rotor {{can also}} be {{referred}} to as a teetering or seesaw rotor. This system is normally composed of two blades that meet just under a common flapping or <b>teetering</b> <b>hinge</b> at the rotor shaft. This allows the blades to flap together in opposite motions like a seesaw. This underslinging of the blades below the <b>teetering</b> <b>hinge,</b> combined with an adequate dihedral or coning angle on the blades, minimizes variations in the radius of each blade's center of mass from the axis of rotation as the rotor turns, which in turn reduces the stress on the blades from lead and lag forces caused by the Coriolis effect. Secondary flapping hinges may also be provided to provide sufficient flexibility to minimize bouncing. Feathering is accomplished by the feathering hinge at the blade root, which allows changes to the pitch angle of the blade.|$|R
50|$|The {{helicopter}} {{rotor system}} {{consists of a}} two-bladed main rotor and two-bladed anti-torque rotor on the tail, each equipped with a <b>teetering</b> <b>hinge.</b> The main rotor is also equipped with two coning hinges. Collective and cyclic pitch inputs to the main rotor are transmitted through pushrods and a conventional swashplate mechanism. Control inputs to the pre-coned tail rotor are transmitted through a single pushrod inside the aluminum tail cone.|$|R
5000|$|Glidden Doman (January 28, 1921 - June 6, 2016) was an American {{aeronautical}} engineer and pioneer in helicopters and modern wind turbines. [...] He founded one of America’s original six helicopter companies (Doman Helicopters, Inc.) after making major {{contributions to the}} use of Sikorsky helicopters during World War II. [...] Doman Helicopters’ most prominent achievement was the Doman LZ-5/YH-31 eight-place helicopter, which received FAA certification on December 30, 1955. [...] The unique feature of this helicopter was its hinge-less but gimbaled, tilting rotor hub that greatly reduced stress and vibration in the blades and in the whole helicopter. Doman {{was one of the first}} to transfer knowledge of helicopter rotor dynamics technology to wind turbines. The 1973 arab oil embargo prompted NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio to lead a 7 year US wind energy program for the development of utility-scale horizontal axis wind turbines. [...] This program featured the creation of Boeing’s MOD-2 with the Doman conceived flexible rotor design, two-bladed wind turbine with a <b>teeter</b> <b>hinge.</b> [...] Following the NASA project, while working for Boeing, Hamilton Standard division of United Technologies, and Aeritalia (later known as Alenia) in Italy, Doman developed large two-bladed, teeter-hinged wind turbines, including the WTS-3, WTS-4, and the Gamma 60. [...] After testing the Gamma 60 in Sardinia for 7 years, Doman and Italian nuclear mechanical engineer Silvestro Caruso founded Gamma Ventures, Inc. to further develop and market this technology. [...] Gamma Ventures subsequently invested in, and sold a license to Seawind of the Netherlands, to commercialize the same two-bladed, teeter-hinge wind turbine concept.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a multibody dynamics model of a VTOL teetering rotor. The developed model includes a teetering hub, containing a flexure and torque tube, rotor blades, pitch links, and swashplate system. A non-teetering rotor configuration, which modified the baseline teetering rotor by removing the <b>teetering</b> <b>hinge,</b> is also developed, and its aeromechanics characteristics compared to those of the baseline teetering design. The rotor aeroelastic responses and loads are studied under various flight conditions including the conversion flights. The rotor natural frequencies are calculated for two blade pitch angles, which represents respectively the rotor operating in helicopter and airplane modes. The MBDyn predictions of aerodynamics loading of the teetering rotor are compared with those of OVERFLOW in both helicopter and airplane modes. The comparison shows overall good agreements. The blade responses and loads in conversion flight are then compared between the baseline teetering rotor and the modified non-teetering version. Similar aeromechanical characteristics are shown for the two rotor configurations, such as the blade response, steady hub loads, and steady and oscillatory blade shear forces. However, the non-teetering rotor displays a much larger blade bending moments, both the mean and oscillatory components. Overall, the study shows that the multibody analysis has the capability to model complex rotor configurations, and helpful in establishing the requirement and criteria applied to VTOL proprotor load analysis in supporting the aircraft design...|$|R
