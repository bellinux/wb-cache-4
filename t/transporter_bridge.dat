5|$|In 1961 the Silver Jubilee Bridge {{replaced}} the outdated <b>Transporter</b> <b>Bridge</b> {{and in recent}} years many of the old heavy chemical factories have closed to be replaced by more modern factories. Much of the land previously polluted by the old dirty chemical processes has been reclaimed, and there have been improvements in the cleanliness and environment of the town.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{architecture}} of the town is undistinguished but {{there are a number of}} listed buildings, many of them in the more outlying areas but some are scattered throughout the town. The listed churches are the Anglican churches of St Luke's, Farnworth (and its adjacent bridewell), and St Mary's, West Bank, the Roman Catholic churches of St Michael's, St Marie's and St Bede's, and the two chapels in the cemetery. The railway stations of Widnes and Hough Green are listed, as are the former town hall and the former power house of the <b>transporter</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
25|$|Newport <b>Transporter</b> <b>Bridge</b> {{is one of}} the few {{remaining}} working bridges of its type in the world and featured in the film Tiger Bay. Visitors can travel on the suspended cradle most days and can walk over the top of the steel framework on bank holidays. The only other British example is Middlesbrough <b>Transporter</b> <b>Bridge.</b> Open days are occasionally held to view the renovation of the historically important Newport Ship.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the oldest}} and largest of the three {{historic}} <b>transporter</b> <b>bridges</b> which remain in Britain, and also the largest of eight such bridges which remain worldwide).|$|R
50|$|The {{first such}} bridge built in France, the 1898 Rouen bridge {{crossing}} the Seine, {{was destroyed by}} the French army to slow down German troops in World War II. <b>Transporter</b> <b>bridges</b> were popular in France, where five were erected and another partially completed.|$|R
50|$|The Deutsche Fährstraße (German Ferry Street), {{established}} in May 2004, is a theme route {{similar to the}} American National Scenic Byways. It connects various places between Bremervörde and Kiel with relation {{to the history of}} ferries and crossing of rivers, like the historic <b>transporter</b> <b>bridges</b> in Rendsburg and Osten.|$|R
25|$|In 2011, Noten {{used the}} large taxi driver {{community}} of the UK industrial city of Middlesbrough to promote the exhibition The Modern Jewel - In time and the mind of others at MIMA, the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art. He thought of working with taxi drivers after seeing the landmark bridge in the area, the Middlesbrough <b>Transporter</b> <b>Bridge,</b> that was celebrating its centenary. The <b>transporter</b> <b>bridge</b> operates {{very much like a}} ferry and during the lengthy crossing taxi drivers usually have nothing much else to do than to talk to their passenger(s).|$|E
25|$|Corporation Road {{follows the}} east bank of the River Usk, but with limited views of the river. It links Newport Bridge to George Street Bridge, Newport City Bridge and, via Stephenson Road, Newport <b>Transporter</b> <b>Bridge.</b>|$|E
25|$|Newport {{has nine}} public bridges {{spanning}} the River Usk, connecting {{the east and}} west of the city. From north to south they are: Caerleon Bridge, St. Julian's railway bridge, M4 motorway Usk bridge, Great Western Railway Usk bridge, Newport Bridge, Newport City footbridge, George Street Bridge, City Bridge and <b>Transporter</b> <b>Bridge.</b> In addition, the Twenty Ten Bridge at the Celtic Manor Resort is a footbridge crossing the River Usk north of Caerleon Bridge and open to the public.|$|E
5000|$|Bremervörde is the {{end point}} of the [...] "Deutsche Fährstraße" [...] {{established}} in May 2004, an institution similar to the American National Scenic Byways. It connects various places between Bremervörde and Kiel with relation {{to the history of}} ferries and crossing of rivers, like the historic <b>transporter</b> <b>bridges</b> in Osten and Rendsburg.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{offers one}} of the best {{panoramic}} views of the city of Kiel. It is also at the beginning and terminating point of a scenic route: the tourist route from Bremervörde to the Kieler Förde connects approximately 50 different ferries, bridges, ship locks, tidal barriers and maritime museums and its landmarks of the Rendsburg and Osten <b>transporter</b> <b>bridges.</b>|$|R
50|$|The factory {{established}} by Joseph Crosfield at Bank Quay in 1815 for soap manufacture {{is still in}} use today as part of Unilever. To link {{two parts of the}} factory complex {{on opposite sides of the}} River Mersey, two <b>Transporter</b> <b>bridges</b> were constructed in the early 20th Century. The second of these survives and is a Grade II* listed building and Scheduled monument.|$|R
25|$|The Old Green Interchange is an {{elevated}} roundabout over the A4042 (Heidenheim Drive) {{at the western}} end of Newport Bridge. Newport's pedestrianised High Street runs southwest from the interchange through Westgate Square to the pedestrianised Commercial Street. Queensway passes Newport railway station and links the Old Green Interchange to Newport Civic Centre via Clytha Park Road. Kingsway/Usk Way is a boulevard on {{the west bank of the}} River Usk linking the Old Green Interchange to the Southern Distributor Road at {{the western end of}} City Bridge and to Newport <b>Transporter</b> <b>Bridge.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{cycle and}} {{pedestrian}} walkway {{on the west}} bank of the River Usk links Newport city centre at Crindau to central Caerleon. There is a marked heritage trail in Caerleon. A cycle and pedestrian walkway is on both banks of the River Usk. The East bank path links Newport Bridge to Lliswerry. The West bank path links Newport Bridge to Newport <b>Transporter</b> <b>Bridge</b> and to Lliswerry via Newport City Bridge. It is therefore possible to walk or cycle from the north to the south of the City whilst largely avoiding public roads.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{landmarks}} of Newport are in Newport {{city centre}} or {{within a short}} {{walking distance of the}} centre; the Railway station, Bus station, Castle, Westgate Hotel, Market, Museum Art Gallery and Central Library, Cathedral, <b>Transporter</b> <b>Bridge,</b> Newport Bridge, Newport City footbridge, George Street Bridge, City Bridge, University of South Wales, Riverfront Arts Centre, Dolman Theatre, Newport Centre, Civic Centre, Newport Technical Institute (former Art College), Shire Hall, Belle Vue Park, Rodney Parade, Newport Crown Court, Ye Olde Murenger House, St Mark's church, St Paul's church, and Royal Gwent Hospital.|$|E

Also at the Oste there are two pram ferries in Gräpel and Brobergen. The ferry in Gräpel is actually manually operated.|$|R
25|$|The 1920s and 1930s were a {{relatively}} busy period for Steinman. His firm {{was involved in}} many significant projects including the Hercilio Luz Bridge (or Florianópolis Bridge, 1926), the Carquinez Strait Bridge (1927, {{at the time the}} second largest cantilever bridge in the US), the Mount Hope Bridge and Grand Mère Suspension Bridge (both 1929), the St. Johns Bridge and Waldo-Hancock Bridge (both 1931), the Sky Ride (1933 passenger <b>transporter</b> <b>bridge</b> at the Chicago Century of Progress exposition), the Henry Hudson Bridge (1936, particularly gratifying as this bridge realised his PhD thesis proposal), the Wellesley and Hill Islands Bridge, Wellesley Island Suspension Bridge and Georgina Island Bridge (all 1938 and part of the Thousand Islands Bridge System), the Deer Isle Bridge and the Sullivan-Hutsonville Bridge (both 1939).|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} decades of the 20th century there was a revival in the local economy, {{particularly}} as the United Alkali Company began to manufacture new products. [...] Improvements were being made to the structure of the town, in particular the opening of the Widnes–Runcorn <b>Transporter</b> <b>Bridge</b> in 1905 which gave the first direct link over the Mersey for road traffic. In 1909 the town became the first in Britain to have a regular covered-top double-decker bus service.|$|E
500|$|World War II hit Rouen hard, {{including}} its transport network. In 1939, {{before the war}} started, mobilisation and requisition had reduced the service frequency; the German advance, in 1940, blew up the city's bridges; on 9 June 1940 the Rouen <b>Transporter</b> <b>Bridge</b> was destroyed, which split the tram network in two until 1946. With the German occupation, the lines were progressively reopened. But service was reduced. Difficulties became such during this period that {{the directors of the}} CTR had to improvise mobile [...] workshops. The heavy bombing raids of Spring 1944, in particular the destruction of {{the central part of the}} Rue Lemire, stopped the trams running.|$|E

500|$|In 1868 the Runcorn Railway Bridge {{was opened}} across the Mersey, giving Runcorn direct rail links with Liverpool {{and the rest}} of the country. [...] In the 1880s a {{pipeline}} was opened between Northwich and Weston Point, supplying brine to the salt and chemical works. [...] In 1894 the Manchester Ship Canal was opened throughout its length. [...] This allowed ocean-going ships to travel inland as far as Salford, some of them calling at the port of Runcorn. The rise in population between 1881 and 1891 and the drop by 1901 is explained by the number of people involved in constructing the ship canal. In 1905 the Widnes-Runcorn <b>Transporter</b> <b>Bridge</b> opened, giving a direct link for vehicular traffic for the first time between the two towns.|$|E
500|$|In 1899 Brunner (who had by then {{been created}} a baronet) became {{chairman}} of the Runcorn and Widnes <b>Transporter</b> <b>Bridge</b> Company. [...] He subscribed £25,000 (£ in [...] ) towards its construction plus a loan of £12,000 (£ in [...] ) together with a personal guarantee on a bank loan of £31,000 (£ in [...] ). [...] When {{the building of the}} bridge was complete in 1905 it was due to be opened by Edward VII, but the king was unable to attend, and so Brunner performed the ceremony himself. [...] By 1911 it had become apparent that the bridge would always operate at a loss, and Brunner assigned his interest in it to Widnes Corporation. [...] The Times stated that this action amounted to a [...] "virtual gift of £68,000" [...] (£ in [...] ).|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20thcentury the {{industry}} of the town continued to be dominated by chemicals and tanning. This growth was largely due to government fixed-priced cost contracts for tanned hides. In 1926 four chemical companies merged to form Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). As the century progressed there was diversification of industry. In 1961 the <b>Transporter</b> <b>Bridge</b> was replaced by Runcorn Road Bridge (since named the Silver Jubilee Bridge) which allowed a more efficient means of road traffic across Runcorn Gap. [...] The designation of Runcorn as a new town in 1964 brought major changes and more than doubled the population. Much of the architecture of the new town was innovative, especially the Southgate development designed by Sir James Stirling and built between 1970 and 1977. Stirling's housing development was beset with problems and it was demolished in the early 1990s. [...] During the second half of the 20th century the tanneries closed (the last to close was the Highfield Tannery in the late 1960s) and the chemical industry declined. At the same time, light industry developed together with warehouses and distribution centres.|$|E
50|$|The M1977 HEMTT Common <b>Bridge</b> <b>Transporter</b> (CBT) is {{a further}} {{development}} of the M1120 LHS, and {{in common with the}} M1120 LHS was initially introduced as part of the HEMTT overhaul/rebuild program. It is used for loading, transporting, and unloading Ribbon Bridge components and bridge erection boats.|$|R
50|$|The weir and its {{associated}} extensive irrigation scheme, were designed in the 1960s by the Consulting Engineers Sir Murdoch McDonald and Partners, of High Holborn, London. At each end it incorporates irrigation canals. These and the weir are crossed by road bridges designed to take the heaviest loads, namely a tank on a wheeled <b>transporter.</b> The <b>bridge</b> works were designed by the then Captain B P Daly of Royal Engineers, who {{was attached to the}} Consultants. The weir was featured on a set of three Iraqi postage stamps.|$|R
50|$|The Tank <b>Bridge</b> <b>Transporter</b> This has {{the same}} {{cross-country}} performance as a tank when loaded. It can carry 1 No 10 bridge or 2 No 12 bridges. It can drop off a load of bridges independently, but it cannot recover them. This is no major limitation because bridges are usually left or destroyed in place.|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Newport (Ymerodraeth State of Mind)" [...] parodies the song, {{replacing}} {{references to the}} [...] "Empire State" [...] of New York with of the smaller Welsh city of Newport. In the Welsh language Ymerodraeth means [...] "empire". [...] "Newport (Ymerodraeth State of Mind)" [...] was directed by British filmmaker M-J Delaney and featured London-based actors Alex Warren and Terema Wainwright, rapping and singing respectively. Days after its release Delaney said: [...] "I hope Jay-Z and Alicia {{get to see the}} video as long as their publishing people don't force us to take it offline. It's only tongue in cheek." [...] Its participants were invited to appear on national television news and their work was reported in national newspapers. Their work was also so well received in Wales that they were invited to the reopening of the Newport <b>Transporter</b> <b>Bridge.</b> It achieved viral video status when it reached nearly a million hits in 3 days and, by August 2010, nearly 2.5million people had watched it on YouTube. In July both Warren and Wainwright met with Universal Records (the music publishers) to discuss releasing the track as a single, with some of the proceeds going to the mental health charity Newport Mind. But the seven co-writers of [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] refused to give permission for the Newport single, a situation which led to the video being removed from YouTube on August 10.|$|E
2500|$|The Runcorn-Widnes <b>Transporter</b> <b>Bridge</b> {{crossed the}} river Mersey and Manchester Ship Canal linking {{the towns of}} Runcorn and Widnes. [...] It was {{completed}} in 1905, it was Britain's first <b>transporter</b> <b>bridge</b> and the largest of its type ever built in the world. [...] It continued in use until 22 July 1961 when it {{was replaced by a}} through arch bridge opened the previous day, which is now known as the Silver Jubilee Bridge. [...] The <b>transporter</b> <b>bridge</b> was then demolished.|$|E
2500|$|In 1899 the Widnes & Runcorn Bridge Company was {{established}} under {{the chairmanship of}} SirJohn Brunner to investigate the options. [...] Their decision was to build a <b>transporter</b> <b>bridge.</b> [...] This would be cheaper than an orthodox type of bridge and {{the passage of the}} transporter car could be timed to allow the passage of the ships. [...] The first <b>transporter</b> <b>bridge</b> in the world had been opened in 1893 in Bilbao, Spain. [...] This had been followed in 1898 by transporter bridges in Rouen, France and in Bizerta, which is now in Tunisia. [...] Parliamentary approval had already been obtained for a <b>transporter</b> <b>bridge</b> over the River Usk at Newport, Monmouthshire. This was then followed by the construction of a <b>transporter</b> <b>bridge</b> in Middlesbrough over the River Tees in 1911.|$|E

40|$|This study {{discusses}} five bridges on Utah 2 ̆ 7 s I- 80 {{that were}} replaced {{in the summer}} of 2008 using Accelerated Bridge Construction methods. Each superstructure was built offsite and moved into place with the use of Self-Propelled Modular <b>Transporters.</b> The <b>bridges</b> were instrumented and monitored during the moving process to investigate the effects of moving an entire superstructure into place. Collected data was analyzed to find the level of stress each superstructure experienced during lifting, moving, and placement of each bridge. The change in supporting conditions from when the superstructure was built to being transferred onto Self-Propelled Modular Transporters caused significant stress reversals for all the bridges studied. A two-dimensional analysis was done using the dead load of the structure to find the initial stresses in the superstructure when supported on temporary abutments. The measured change in stress due to lifting was compared to calculations. The difference between these two stresses was defined as the lifting stress in the superstructure. Additionally, dynamic stresses incurred due to the bridge moving are determined to be within design tolerance...|$|R
