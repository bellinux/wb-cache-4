500|$|In 1982, {{an investigative}} {{reporter}} named Gary Moore from the St. Petersburg Times drove from the Tampa area to Cedar Key looking for a story. When he commented to a local on the [...] "gloomy atmosphere" [...] of Cedar Key, and questioned why a Southern town was all-white when {{at the start of}} the 20th century it had been nearly half black, the local woman replied, [...] "I know what you're digging for. You're <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> to talk about that massacre." [...] Moore was hooked. He was able to convince Arnett Doctor to join him on a visit to the site, which he did without telling his mother. Moore addressed the disappearance of the incident from written or spoken history: [...] "After a week of sensation, the weeks of January 1923 seem to have dropped completely from Florida's consciousness, like some unmentionable skeleton in the family closet".|$|E
500|$|At an August {{debate in}} Owensboro, Farmer {{proposed}} the cross-promotion of Kentucky agricultural products {{and the state}} park system, awarding points for buying Kentucky produced groceries that could be redeemed for souvenirs and perks during stays at state parks. On October 21, The Kentucky Post gave Baesler its endorsement, contrasting her experience running a farm and her involvement with the agriculture department to Farmer's lack of agriculture experience and frequent absence at campaign events. Later that week, the Lexington Herald-Leader also endorsed Baesler, and followed {{up the next day}} with an article noting that, as of October 3, nearly one-third of the $87,825.20 Farmer had spent during the campaign went to relatives [...] including his parents, brother, sister, and in-laws [...] for salaries and campaign-related reimbursements. Interviewed by phone, Farmer responded, [...] " [...] probably worked 60, 70, 80 hours a week campaigning for me <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> elected. I don't think we have done anything wrong." [...] Richard Beliles, chairman of campaign finance watchdog Common Cause of Kentucky, said Farmer's actions were not illegal but were [...] "rather odd". Farmer overcame the bad press, however, to take the election by a vote of 575,049 to 466,321.|$|E
500|$|The Aggies {{won only}} one game against seven defeats in 1928. [...] In late November, {{the day after}} a 46â€“0 loss to Oklahoma, {{newspapers}} reported that [...] "reliable sources" [...] had said Maulbetsch intended to resign. [...] Maulbetsch immediately denied the rumor, saying: [...] "I have not resigned. [...] I am aware that a faction here is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> out, but I {{do not intend to}} throw up the sponge." [...] In December, pressure to fire Maulbetsch grew, and one Oklahoma newspaper observed: [...] "Coach Maulbetsch of the A. & M. football team is the object of attacks from many sides because of the rather poor showing made by his team during the past season. [...] They are looking for a goat and just now Johnnie is cast in that role. [...] Regardless of his past record, those who demand victory at any price and by any means whatsoever, are insisting that he be fired forthwith and a man be placed in the position who, by fair means or foul, will gather in a team that will win victories and never lose a game." [...] Ultimately, Maulbetsch resigned at the end of May 1929 as Oklahoma A's coach in football, baseball, and basketball. [...] It was announced that he would spend the remaining year of his contract on a leave of absence at half pay.|$|E

2500|$|Walter Pincus, a Washington Post columnist, has {{reported}} that he was told in confidence by an unnamed Bush administration official on July 12, 2003, two days before Novak's column appeared, that [...] "the White House had not paid attention to former Ambassador Joseph Wilson's CIA-sponsored February 2002 trip to Niger because it was set up as a boondoggle by his wife, {{an analyst with the}} agency working on weapons of mass destruction." [...] Because he did not believe it to be true, Pincus claims, he did not report the story in The Washington Post until October 12, 2003: [...] "I wrote my October story because I did not think the person who spoke to me was committing a criminal act, but only practicing damage control by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> to stop writing about Wilson. Because of that article, The Washington Post and I received subpoenas last summer from Patrick J. Fitzgerald." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{commentators}} {{have said that}} the harassment associated with Gamergate springs from this existing well of deep-seated misogyny, and that it was merely brought to the fore by the anonymity of the Internet. Regarding the false allegations against Quinn, Amanda Marcotte in an article for The Daily Beast accused the video game world of being [...] "thick with misogynists who are aching to swarm" [...] with hate on any [...] "random woman held up for them to hate, no matter what the pretext". She related these attacks to harassment sent to a woman who criticized a Teen Titans cover and to a community manager of the Mighty No. 9 game because she drew a feminine Mega Man, and virtual rapes committed against women's player avatars in Grand Theft Auto V and DayZ. In an interview with the BBC, Quinn stated that [...] "Before [...] had a name, it was nothing but <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> to kill myself, trying to get people to hurt me, going after my family. ... There is no mention of ethics in journalism at all outside of making the same accusation everybody makes towards any successful woman; that clearly she got to where she is because she had sex with someone." [...] Danielle Citron of the University of Maryland wrote that the intent of this type of harassment is to demean the victim, make them doubt their own integrity, and to redefine the victim's identity in order to [...] "fundamentally distort who she is".|$|E

6000|$|But {{whatever}} {{the meaning of}} Hukweem's crying, it seems to constitute {{a large part of}} his existence. Indeed, it is as a cry that he is chiefly known--the wild, unearthly cry of the wilderness night. His education for this begins very early. Once I was exploring the grassy shores of a wild lake when a mother loon appeared suddenly, out in the middle, with a great splashing and crying. I paddled out to see what was the matter. She withdrew with a great effort, apparently, as I approached, still crying loudly and beating the water with her wings. [...] "Oho," [...] I said, [...] "you have a nest in there somewhere, and now you are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> away from it." [...] This was the only time I have ever known a loon to try that old mother bird's trick. Generally they slip off the nest while the canoe is yet half a mile away, and swim under water a long distance, and watch you silently {{from the other side of}} the lake.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was years}} and years ago. I had {{received}} a note from Mr. Augustin Daly of the Fifth Avenue Theatre, asking me to call the next time I should be in New York. I was writing plays, in those days, and he was admiring them and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> {{a chance to get}} them played in Siberia. I took the first train--the early one--the one that leaves Hartford at 8.29 in the morning. At New Haven I bought a paper, and found it filled with glaring display-lines about a [...] "bench-show" [...] there. I had often heard of bench-shows, but had never felt any interest in them, because I supposed they were lectures that were not well attended. It turned out, now, that it was not that, but a dog-show. There was a double-leaded column about the king-feature of this one, which was called a Saint Bernard, and was worth $10,000, and was known to be the largest and finest of his species in the world. I read all this with interest, because out of my school-boy readings I dimly remembered how the priests and pilgrims of St. Bernard used {{to go out in the}} storms and dig these dogs out of the snowdrifts when lost and exhausted, and give them brandy and save their lives, and drag them to the monastery and restore them with gruel.|$|E
