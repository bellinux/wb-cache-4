40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{extensive}} ductile crack growth by modeling a mode I fracture experiment conducted {{on a large}} aluminum plate by Simonsen & Törnqvist (2004). Ductile tearing on a structural scale presents a problem of considerable practical interest, and it requires structural scale plate/shell finite elements whose size are generally {{much larger than the}} plate thickness. In this paper a cohesive zone model is employed. For tearing of large plates it is essential to account {{for the fact that the}} cohesive tearing energy has a dependence on the extent of crack advance which must be calibrated against experimental test data. The steady-state cohesive energy attained after a crack advance of more than five to ten plate thicknesses is informed by the analysis of fine scale processes involving necking localization and shear failure. In a large plate problem, dissipation in the plastic field surrounding the cohesive zone can significantly enhance the resistance to crack growth, illustrated here by the <b>tearing</b> <b>test</b> on the aluminum plate and by an analysis of crack growth resistance of a large plate under small scale yielding. The structural scale model reveals the partition of the tearing energy into the cohesive energy and the additional plastic dissipation occurring outside the cohesive zone.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{experiment}} is to analyse dependence of roughness of machined surface on adhesion performance of various anticorrosion systems. In order to prepare samples for the experiment, samples were milled on a knee and column type of a horizontal milling machine. Depending on cutting conditions and machining tool, there were set intervals of roughness of machined surface which are commonly achievable on this type of machine. It is a roughness in the interval of 0. 4 – 1. 6 µm (finishing), 1. 6 – 6. 3 µm (standard milling) a 6. 3 – 12. 5 µm (roughening). Removable cutting tips were used as a machining tool and for roughening, a shell end milling cutter NAREX 63 x 40 HSS 90 was used.

40|$|Composites {{are widely}} used in an {{increasing}} number of applications in diverse fields. However, most traditional composite materials are difficult to recycle. Because of their enhanced recyclability, thermoplastic single-polymer composites (SPCs), i. e., composites with fiber and matrix made from the same thermoplastic polymer, have attracted much attention in the recent years. High-performance polymer fibers in combination with same polymer matrices would lead to a fully recyclable single polymer composite that has major ecological advantages. However, because a single polymer is involved in the composite, thermoplastic SPCs manufacturing presents a unique set of technical problems, and different approaches from those in standard composites manufacturing are frequently needed. Two specific issues in SPCs manufacturing are how to produce distinct forms of the same polymer and how to consolidate them. So far, most investigations have been reported on a single-component hot compaction method and two-component molecular methods. However, in these methods, either the processing window is too narrow or some impure materials are introduced into the system. The key issue in thermoplastic SPCs processing is how to melt-process the matrix without significantly annealing or even melting the fiber. To overcome the above drawbacks in existing SPCs processing, particularly to widen the SPCs processing temperature window and to purify the SPCs, a novel SPCs manufacturing process utilizing the characteristics of slowly crystallizing polymers was developed and investigated. Highly oriented and highly crystalline fibers made of a slowly crystallizing polymer are mixed with the amorphous form of the same polymer and then consolidated together under heat and pressure. In this dissertation research, two slowly crystallizing polymers, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA), were used as model systems for SPCs processing [...] To study the deformation and failure mechanisms of PET and PLA SPCs, the SPCs were characterized using tensile test, <b>tearing</b> <b>test,</b> impact test, SEM, optical microscopy, and other methods. The change of crystallinity and orientation of the material forms during SPCs processing were characterized by DSC and XRD. The effects of major process conditions on the performance of the SPCs were studied. It was found that the processing temperature played a profound role in affecting the fiber-matrix bonding property. The compression molded SPCs exhibited enhanced mechanical properties. For the PET SPCs with 45 % by weight fiber content the tensile strength is four folds of that of non-reinforced PET. After reinforcement, the tearing strength of the PLA SPCs is almost an order higher than that of the non-reinforced PLA. The fusion bonding behavior of two crystallizable amorphous PET sheets was also studied. Several characterization methods including SEM, TEM and polarized microscopy (either on etched or on non-etched samples) were used to observe interfacial bonding morphology of the crystallizable amorphous PET sheets. For a bonded sample, a layer of transcrystals with a thickness of 1 - 2 Ým was found right at the interface. A secondary but much larger zone with a distinct morphology was observed outside the transcrystal layer. With increase of the heating time, the width of the whole interfacial region decreases. The interfacial morphology was found to significantly affect the interfacial bonding quality. The testing results further indicated that high bonding temperature with an appropriate holding time promotes interfacial bonding of two crystallizable amorphous PET. Ph. D.

40|$|Hot tearing {{is one of}} {{the most}} severe defects {{observed}} in castings, e. g. in billets or sheet ingots of aluminum alloys produced by DC casting. It is due to both tensile strains and a lack of interdendritic feeding in the mushy zone. In order to predict this phenomenon at the scale of an entire casting, the two-phase averaged conservation equations for mass and momentum must be solved in the mushy (i. e. mixed solid and liquid) region of the material. In recent contributions, M'Hamdi et al [1] proposed a strongly coupled resolution scheme for this set of equations. The solution of the problem was obtained using a rheological model established by Ludwig et al [2] and that captures the partially cohesive nature of the mushy alloy. In the present contribution, the problem is addressed using a slightly different approach. The same rheological model (i. e. saturated porous media treatment) is used, but the influence of the liquid pressure is neglected at this stage. This assumption allows for a weakly coupled resolution scheme in which the mechanical problem is first solved alone using ABAQUS™ and user subroutines. Then the pressure in the liquid phase is calculated separately accounting for the viscoplastic deformation of the porous solid skeleton and solidification shrinkage. This is done with a code previously developed for porosity calculations, and that uses a refined mesh in the mushy zone [3]. This semi-coupled method was implemented and its numerical convergence studied from the point of view of both time step and mesh size. Guidelines for selecting these numerical parameters as well as the conditions under which the semi-coupled method may be applied are provided. The model was then applied to three cases, i. e. two tensile tests conducted on mushy alloys [4, 5] and the casting of an entire billet [6]. Experimental data was indeed available concerning these problems prior to the present work. This information was used for the validation of the thermal and mechanical models that were setup to describe these different cases. The results of the semi-coupled approach were also used to describe in more details these different castings. First of all, the numerical study of the mushy zone <b>tearing</b> <b>test</b> [5] proved helpful for distinguishing different fracture modes. The role of the high strain rate applied to the mushy alloy in this case was also outlined. Another tensile test, referred to as the rig test [4], was successfully modeled in the present framework. The numerical results could be used to quantify the redistribution of strain in the mushy sample. As a consequence, intrinsic properties of the material, such as its ductility, could be extracted from the results. This study also gave further insight about the conditions under which tearing occurs in the samples. Finally, the semi-coupled method was used to study the DC casting process. In this case, a real process performed under realistic conditions for the production of an industrial scale billet was modeled. As it is more complex and difficult to characterize experimentally, the conditions for hot tearing formation are less accessible. However, the isotherm velocity, the strain, the strain rate and the liquid pressure could be described reasonably accurately. It was thus possible to correlate experimental observations of the hot tear with various calculated indicators of hot tearing susceptibility. Even with this information, it remains difficult to formulate new hot tearing criteria because all the indicators follow a similar trend during the casting and their respective contributions can thus not be distinguished. The present work showed that the level of accuracy and detail that can be reached using two-phase models with appropriate materials properties and boundary conditions is satisfactory. It is indeed possible to model the relevant phenomena (heat flow, solid deformation and liquid feeding) at the scale of an entire casting. The variation of the different simulated fields can be described down to a scale of the order of a few millimeters. In that sense, this approach is one important aspect required to build a multiscale model for the problem of hot tearing. It is expected that coupling such a method with granular models (which cover length scales from a few microns to a few centimeters [7]) will allow for a more complete description of the phenomena at hand. In the future, the development of such a multiscale numerical tool may prove to be the most efficient way towards quantitative predictions of hot tearing formation in real solidification processes...|$|E
40|$|Semi-continuous direct-chill (DC) casting of {{aluminium}} ingots {{suffers from a}} very frequent defect {{which can lead to}} a strong decrease in productivity: hot tearing. This phenomenon takes place in the mushy state (i. e., at solid fractions, gs, lower than unity). In order to solve this problem, research moved towards the development of models for the prediction of the hot cracking sensitivity of any kind of alloy under given casting conditions. The defect being of complex nature and revealing some random aspects, the models must describe in the most precise way the interconnected mechanisms intervening in the formation and propagation of the crack. However, an approach supporting the separate study of each mechanism in order to integrate them, thereafter, in a single model, emerged as the way to follow from now on. The objective of this research task is to study the mechanisms leading to hot cracking {{of aluminium}} alloys during continuous casting processes, in order to deduce from them the fundamental parameters and mechanisms that will be integrated in the models to predict hot cracking sensitivity. For this purpose, two relevant aspects were targeted: the mechanical behaviour of the material in the semi-solid state {{as a function of the}} microstructure, and also the coalescence phenomenon. In order to study these phenomena, specific apparatus were developed in the laboratory. The first one, previously used by Farup et al. [Far 01] for in-situ observation of organic alloys (succinonitrile- 0. 5 wt pct acetone), was improved in order to allow more precise observations under better controlled conditions of the hot cracking phenomenon in columnar grains. Then, in order to study the mechanical behaviour of an Al- 4. 5 wt pct Cu alloy as a function of three various types of microstructures (equiaxed, E, columnar radial parallel to the shear plane, C//, and columnar longitudinal perpendicular to this plane, Cperp), a torsion test performed on hollow cylindrical specimens in the semi-solid state was built, based on the original idea of Mahjoub et al. [Mah 00]. Finally, an apparatus intended to tear a grain-refined Al- 1 wt pct Cu alloy in the semi-solid state, avoiding any contact with air during the test, was designed. In order to optimize the tests on the Al-Cu alloys, numerical simulations of the thermal field in the specimens were made. Moreover, as a complement to the experimental results, numerical simulations of the mechanics for the torsion test were carried out so as to study the arrangement influence of the wet grain boundaries within a medium made up of hexagonal grains. From the tests on the organics, two distinct cases depending on the value of gs at which the grain boundary is stressed could be observed: either ''healing'' of the crack due to liquid feeding in the zone under constraints, or the formation of a hot crack. Finally, temperature ranges within which intra- and intergranular coalescence start to take place were established and used in a simple model (Rappaz-Drezet-Gremaud [Rap 99]) for the prediction of hot cracking. Temperatures for coherency loss of an Al- 4. 5 wt pct Cu alloy, as a function of the microstructure, were obtained using the torsion test. Moreover, creep tests made it possible to describe the deformation mode depending on the type of microstructure tested. An evolution of the E and C// samples behaviour towards that of a fully solid material could be highlighted by fitting the curves with a Norton's power law, in the case of an increase of gs from 90 to 92 %. The Cperp samples always showed a higher resistance to deformation compared to that of the other microstructures. The <b>tearing</b> <b>test</b> results highlighted a strong increase in the maximal force needed to break a grain-refined Al- 1 wt pct Cu specimen as gs reached approximately 95 %. The latter is attributed to a start of coalescence between the grains. Observations under the microscope of the broken surfaces confirmed this assumption by revealing a transition from a smooth surface with a dendritic aspect to a surface containing important sharp-edged areas. An evolution in the shape of the spikes left by the broken bridges could also be highlighted. The temperature versus solid fraction curves were determined using the thermal analysis method developed at the laboratory by Campanella et al. [Cam 01]: the single pan thermal analysis (SPTA). Indeed, this method allows a closer description of the actual solidification path for systems out of equilibrium. Finally, the study by successive transverse sectioning of a DC cast billet containing a hot crack was undertaken. The results point out the crack evolution in the case of a constant increase of the casting speed. The crack starts as a concentration of microporosity in the centre of the billet that quickly changes to an annular shape made of microcracks. Then, it moves off centre taking the shape of a linear crack. Eventually, the crack moves again to the billet centre with a typical "star" crack shape...|$|E

In addition to routine ocular examinations, corneal epithelial integrity (vital staining <b>tests,</b> <b>tear</b> film break up time (BUT), anterior fluorometry, specular microscopy) and <b>tear</b> function (Schirmer's <b>test,</b> cotton thread <b>test,</b> <b>tear</b> clearance <b>test</b> (TCT)) were examined before and after the treatment.  RESULTS—Both eyedrops caused significant reduction in intraocular pressure from the baseline levels. No significant changes were noted in corneal integrity in both groups, except a decrease in BUT at 20  weeks in the timolol group. The timolol group demonstrated significant decreases in Schirmer's <b>test,</b> <b>tear</b> clearance <b>test,</b> and <b>tear</b> function index (Schirmer's test value multiplied by clearance test); however, no such changes were noted in the unoprostone group.  CONCLUSION—While unoprostone eyedrops caused no adverse effects on the corneal epithelial integrity and tear function, timolol caused significant impairments in tear production and turnover. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} reference values for selected ophthalmic diagnostic tests in New Zealand rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). A total of 22 adult male rabbits were used. The ophthalmic tests included evaluation of tear production with Schirmer <b>tear</b> <b>test</b> 1 (STT 1) and Endodontic absorbent paper point <b>tear</b> <b>test</b> (EAPPTT) using two different commercial brand materials. Applanation tonometry, Culture of the conjunctival bacterial flora,, conjunctival cytology and conjunctival histology were also performed. Mean (±SD) for STT 1, EAPPTTa, EAPPTTb and IOP was 7. 27 ± 2. 51 mm/min, 12. 43 ± 1. 69 mm/min, 15. 24 ± 2. 07 mm/min, 12. 89 ± 2. 80 mm Hg, respectively. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus sp. and Bacillus sp. were predominant. The cytological evaluation revealed the presence columnar epithelial cells, superficial squamous keratinized cells, lymphocytes, heterophils, red blood cells, mucus and bacteria. The histological analysis revealed a stratified epithelium, characterized by the presence of columnar epithelial cells with a large number of goblet cells. The reported data can be used for therapeutic or experimental purposes...|$|R
30|$|Preliminary <b>tearing</b> <b>tests</b> {{have shown}} that {{handmade}} Chinese papers have low inter-fibre bonding but high fibre strength. As the zero-span test is a widely accepted method of measurement of fibre strength within a sheet [42], it was the method of choice, although the role of inter-fibre bonding in this property is still not fully understood [43]. Another criterion for this choice was that smaller samples are needed, compared to tensile strength testing.|$|R
5000|$|Keratoconjunctivitis sicca {{is common}} in dogs. Most cases are caused by a genetic predisposition, but chronic conjunctivitis, canine distemper, and drugs such as {{sulfasalazine}} and trimethoprim-sulfonamide also cause the disease. [...] Symptoms include eye redness, a yellow or greenish discharge, ulceration of the cornea, pigmented cornea, and blood vessels on the cornea. Diagnosis is made by measuring tear production with a Schirmer <b>tear</b> <b>test.</b> Less than 15 milliliters of tears produced in a minute is abnormal.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{investigation}} is made into the fracture properties of polymer films and laminates under cutting by a sharp tool and lateral tension under pure shear conditions. The method involves {{use of a}} sharp razor blade applied to the crack tip of polymer films which are also stretched orthogonal to {{the direction of the}} blade. The reaction force is measured as the cutting tool cuts the material and the force from applying a lateral strain is measured. The analysis and tests assume quasi-static conditions. The method is applied to a polyester film and three polyester laminates. Steady-state cutting forces are observed from cutting tests and loads at crack initiation are observed from lateral stretching tests. With fracture mechanics analysis the energy contributions from cutting and tearing are used to determine apparent fracture properties from the experimental results. It is observed that the cutting and <b>tearing</b> <b>tests</b> yield similar fracture toughness properties for the three tested polyester laminates, despite the different crack tip geometry at the point of crack growth. However, significantly larger fracture toughness values are measured from <b>tearing</b> <b>tests</b> versus cutting tests for the tested polyester film...|$|R
40|$|Trouser <b>tear</b> <b>testing</b> {{has been}} {{concerned}} {{in this research}} work. A polypropylene film and a low density polyethylene film used in the packaging industry are considered. The experimental trouser <b>tear</b> <b>tests</b> showed different results for both materials when they were subjected to load in different material directions. Therefore the hypothesis was verified, that the in-plane material orientation/alignment induced during manufacturing, hence creating anisotropic in-plane mechanical properties, also affects the tearing behavior. A brittle-like failure was shown in the polypropylene film while the low density polyethylene presented a highly ductile behavior. The two polymer films can be classified as one low-extensible and one high-extensible material according to the test method utilized. Material parameters in the principal material directions i. e. manufacturing direction and cross direction were extracted from the experimental tests for further numerical studies. Scanning electron microscope was used for micromechanical and fractographical analysis of the crack tip and crack surfaces created during the tests. The methods discussed will help classify different groups of materials {{and can be used}} as a predictive tool for the crack initiation and crack propagation path in packaging material, especially thin polymer films.
