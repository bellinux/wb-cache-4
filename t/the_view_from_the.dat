5|$|In 2011, {{a council}} {{gardening}} scheme created a horticultural landscape {{next to the}} southern end of the M32. The project included planting of red poppies, cornflowers, and marigolds. A spokesman said they hoped it would enhance <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> motorway and provide additional habitats for wildlife including bees and butterflies. The gardens were well-received by locals and led to a city-wide project called Meadow Bristol, to grow similar meadows elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|St Michael's parish church {{contains}} {{a number of}} historical highlights, including an impressive late medieval rood screen and rood stair, and an attractive stained glass window designed by Sir Henry Holiday. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> churchyard of the surrounding hills and coastline is breathtaking.|$|E

5|$|Berkeley House on Piccadilly {{was named}} after John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton who had {{purchased}} its land, and that surrounding it, shortly after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660. In 1696, the Berkeley family sold the house and grounds to the 1st Duke of Devonshire (who renamed it Devonshire House) on the proviso that <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{rear of the house}} should not be spoiled. Berkeley Square was laid out {{to the rear of the}} house in the 1730s; because of the conditions of sale, houses were only built on the east and west sides of it. The west side still has various mid-18th century buildings along it, while the east side now contains offices including Berkeley Square House.|$|E
5|$|Henry Fownes Luttrell, {{who married}} Margaret, Alexander's daughter, {{and took the}} Luttrell name, moved to Dunster in 1747. The couple {{redesigned}} and redecorated the castle in a Rococo style, including the extensive use of the recently invented and highly fashionable wallpaper. Henry Luttrell raised the ground height of the Lower Ward between 1764 and 1765 to extend the New Way all {{around to the front}} of his mansion, adding additional ornamental towers onto the inside of the Great Gatehouse in the process. A folly, Conygar Tower, was constructed by architect Richard Phelps to improve <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> castle, and a larger park of 141 hectares (348acres) was built just to the south of the castle, requiring the eviction of a number of tenant farmers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} scope and impact of {{innovative}} development finance (IDF) in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries in the 2000 s. It also reports <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> region’s relevant actors regarding IDF. The paper finds that very little IDF flowed to LAC in the 2000 s, though it was significant for a few, poorer, and smaller countries, such as Haiti and Nicaragua. <b>The</b> <b>views</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> region suggest that LAC should fight for greater share of existing and prospective IDF, but also make better use of other available resources, such as remittances and flows through South-South cooperation.

5|$|The Helix has {{traditionally}} been known for offering {{a panoramic view of}} the New York skyline. While local zoning laws prohibit the construction of high-rise buildings that would obstruct sight-lines from higher points in town, as of June 2013 construction of a new residential building partially blocked <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lower portion of the roadway. As of 2015, the Helix is considered by the PANYNJ to have a working life-span of ten years. Alternatives to its replacement include tunnels under the Palisades directly to the Lincoln Tunnel portals.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of Chester Cathedral gives {{a warm and}} mellow appearance because of the pinkish colour of the sandstone. The proportions appear spacious because <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> west end of the nave to the east end is unimpeded by a pulpitum and the nave, although not long, is both wide and high compared with many of England's cathedrals. The piers of the nave and choir are widely spaced, those of the nave carrying only the clerestory of large windows with no triforium gallery. The proportions are made possible partly because the ornate stellar vault, like that at York Minster, is of wood, not stone.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top on a {{clear day}} extends across the whole of the Lake District to the Solway Firth and hills of {{south-west}} Scotland to the north-west, Cheviot and the Pennine Hills to the north-east, Morecambe Bay, Blackpool and the coast of North Wales to the south, and the Irish Sea to the west. Snowdon is hidden by the Coniston Fells, and the Isle of Man is largely hidden behind the Great Gable and Pillar group of fells.|$|E

5|$|Tourism {{has been}} a more {{successful}} industry in the area. For over two hundred years visitors have been drawn by the lake and mountain scenery of the Lake District, and many have {{made their way to}} the top of Helvellyn. Among the early visitors to Helvellyn were the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, both of whom lived nearby at one period. Many routes up the mountain are possible so that it may be approached from all directions. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top is one of the most extensive over the Lake District, and on a clear day the view can also stretch from Scotland to Wales.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, trade between Minehead and Ireland, South Wales, Bristol and Bridgwater grew, with forty vessels based in the harbour for trade and herring fishing. It was also a departure point for pilgrims to Santiago de Compostella. Until the 19th century trade continued with Ireland but Minehead vessels started to travel further afield to Virginia and the West Indies. Further problems with the port continued and led to a decline in trade and the fisheries in the late 18th century and in 1834 the port lost its jurisdiction to Bridgwater. In the 20th century most trade transferred to larger ports, but pleasure steamers did call at the port. Minehead Lifeboat Station was established in 1901 near the harbour. The pier was demolished during the Second World War as it obstructed <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gun battery on the quay head, as part of the coastal defence preparations, which stopped steamers calling at the harbour until it was cleared in 1951. In 1808 a ship, believed to be the Bristol Packet which had been built in 1801 was wrecked on Madbrain Sands.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the castle}} meres can still be seen to the west {{of the castle}}, {{although}} in the 16th century there were two lakes, much larger than today, complete with a wharf. This dramatic use of water to reflect the image of the castle is similar to that used at several other castles of the period, including Bredwardine and Ravensworth Castle. Water castles such as Framlingham made greater use of water than was necessary for defence and enhanced the appearance of the castle. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Great Hall in the Inner Court would originally have included the gardens of the Lower Court, and these would have then been framed by the mere and the Great Park beyond. The area around the castle today remains a designed and managed landscape; although the Great Park is now covered by fields, the view still gives a sense of how the castle and landscape was meant to appear to its late medieval owners.|$|E
