5|$|During the war, {{plans were}} drawn up to quell Welsh {{nationalism}} by affiliating Elizabeth {{more closely with}} Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for various reasons, which included a fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd, {{at a time when}} Britain was at war. Welsh politicians suggested that she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent. In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.|$|E

5|$|Moffat {{initially}} doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for {{the role}} of Claire Jackman because he associated her too much with Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom Coupling. Moffat did not imagine the character to be as beautiful as Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked herself out of the role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife.</b> Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Ryan Key {{lying on his}} bed in an apartment. Suddenly, he gets {{swallowed}} by the bedsheets (this is where the track starts to play). The scene then shifts to Key in another dimension, ending up next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> of another man. The man notices Key, and he runs away from the man. Hiding in the bathroom, Key escapes through a window, where he ends up on a neighborhood street. Someone dressed in dark clothing gestures to offer him a drink, when Key notices {{he is in a}} bar filled with Asian people. During part of the video, it features the band performing in front of a crowd wearing suits. The chase continues through a hallway, underwater, to a hospital bed, and back. The video is based in a scene of the 1999 film Being John Malkovich, where Cameron Diaz chases Catherine Keener within the subconscious of Malkovich.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the comparatively limited methods of divorce available to a woman, Islam allows a Muslim husband to unilaterally divorce his wife, as talaq, with no requirement to show cause; however, in practice there is variance by country as to whether there are any additional legal processes when a husband divorces his wife by this method. For example, the Tunisian Law of Personal Status (1957) makes repudiation by a husband invalid until it has been ratified by a court, and provides for further financial compensation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife.</b> Similar laws have been enacted elsewhere, both within an interpretive framework of traditional sharī'ah law, and through the operation of civil codes not based upon the sharī'ah. However, upon talaq, the husband must pay the wife her deferred mahr. Some Muslim-majority countries mandate additional financial contributions to be made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> {{on top of the}} mahr: for example, the Syrian Law of Personal Status (1953) makes the payment of maintenance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> by the husband obligatory for one year after the divorce, which is thus a legal recourse of the wife against the husband. The husband is free to marry again immediately after a divorce, but the woman must observe iddah, that is wait for 3 lunar months before she can remarry after divorce, to establish paternity, in case she discovers she is pregnant. In case of death of her husband, the iddah period is 4 lunar months and 10 days before she can start conjugal relations with another Muslim man.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, the {{obligations}} of the husband include providing for his wife. He is obligated to provide for her sustenance for her benefit; in exchange, he is also entitled to her income. However, this is a right <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife,</b> and she can release her husband of the obligation of sustaining her, and she can then keep her income exclusively for herself.

25|$|Different {{systems of}} {{succession}} have been used, such as proximity of blood, primogeniture, and agnatic seniority (Salic law). While most monarchs have been male, many female monarchs also have reigned in history; the term queen regnant {{refers to a}} ruling monarch, while a queen consort refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> of a reigning king. Rule may be hereditary in practice without being considered a monarchy, {{such as that of}} family dictatorships or political families in many democracies.|$|E

25|$|If {{the wife}} was left without {{maintenance}} during an involuntary absence {{of her husband}} (called to war, etc.), she could cohabit with another man, but must return to her husband when he came back, {{the children of the}} second union remaining with their own father. If she had maintenance, a breach of the marriage tie was adultery. Willful desertion by, or exile of, the husband dissolved the marriage without penalty <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife.</b> If he returned, she was not required or even permitted to return to him.|$|E
25|$|Bhotiya {{marriages are}} similar to Hindu weddings. When the bride's palanquin arrives at her husband's house, gods are worshipped and then she is {{admitted}} to the house. Rice, silver or gold is put {{in the hands of}} bridegroom, which he passes on to the bride. She places them in a winnowing fan, and hands them as a present <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> of the barber. This ceremony is known as Karj Bharna. A man may have not more than three wives. The first wife is the head wife, and she inherits an additional one tenth of the husband's estate.|$|E
25|$|The rabbis {{in ancient}} times insisted on the {{marriage}} couple entering into the ketubah as a protection for the wife. It acted as a replacement of the biblical mohar – the price paid by the groom to the bride, or her parents, for the marriage (i.e., the bride price). The ketubah became a mechanism whereby the amount due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> (the bride-price) came to be paid {{in the event of}} the cessation of marriage, either by the death of the husband or divorce. It may be noted that the biblical mohar created a major social problem: many young prospective husbands could not raise the mohar at the time when they would normally be expected to marry. So, to enable these young men to marry, the rabbis, in effect, delayed the time that the amount would be payable, when they {{would be more likely to}} have the sum. The mechanism adopted was to provide for the mohar to be a part of the ketubah. It may also be noted that both the mohar and the ketubah amounts served the same purpose: the protection for the wife should her support (either by death or divorce) cease. The only difference between the two systems was the timing of the payment. A modern secular equivalent would be the entitlement to alimony in the event of divorce. Another function performed by the ketubah amount was to provide a disincentive for the husband contemplating divorcing his wife: he would need to have the amount to be able to pay <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife.</b>|$|E
