25|$|In Vietnam, {{water buffalo}} {{are often the}} most {{valuable}} possession of poor farmers: 'Con trâu là đầu cơ nghiệp'. They are treated {{as a member of}} the family: 'Chồng cày, vợ cấy, con trâu đi bừa', meaning 'the husband ploughs, the wife sows, water buffalo draws the rake'. Children <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> water buffalo: 'Bao giờ cây lúa còn bông. Thì còn ngọn cỏ ngoài đồng trâu ăn'. Hà Nội used to be named Kim Ngưu - Golden Water Buffalo.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} a fairly limited side effect profile for honokiol and {{it appears to be}} fairly well tolerated. However, its {{antithrombotic}} effects could cause hemorrhage especially in patients with conditions that would put them at a higher risk like hemophilia or Von Willebrand disease. Additionally, patients already taking anticoagulants should <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> doctor before taking honokiol supplements. Honokiol is also neurotoxic at high concentrations. In a 2002 study, researchers induced cell death in fetal rat cortical neurons by directly applying 100μM in vitro.|$|E

He thought of working with taxi drivers after seeing the landmark bridge in the area, the Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge, that was celebrating its centenary. The transporter bridge operates {{very much like a}} ferry and during the lengthy crossing taxi drivers usually have nothing much else to do than to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> passenger(s).|$|E
25|$|Agnes’s {{relationship}} with her daughter, Julia, does not fare much better. Julia also embarrasses her mother. When Julia becomes hysterical, Tobias asks Agnes to go <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> daughter. Agnes’s response is, “I haven’t the time.” Instead of empathizing with Julia, Agnes becomes more self-absorbed. She tells her husband that she has suffered far more than her daughter. This same self-absorption is apparent in all of Agnes’s relationships. She easily becomes lost in self-pity {{and at the same}} time believes herself to be above everyone around her. If she is the fulcrum of the balance in the family, Albee portrays her as a very unstable one. Albee has admitted that the character of Agnes is based on his real-life adopted mother.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study done}} by social {{psychologist}} Shawn Burn, {{it was found that}} personal contact with individuals within a neighborhood is {{the most effective way to}} increase recycling within a community. In his study, he had 10 block leaders <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> neighbors and persuade them to recycle. A comparison group was sent fliers promoting recycling. It was found that the neighbors that were personally contacted by their block leaders recycled much more than the group without personal contact. As a result of this study, Shawn Burn believes that personal contact within a small group of people is an important factor in encouraging recycling. Another study done by Stuart Oskamp examines the effect of neighbors and friends on recycling. It was found in his studies that people who had friends and neighbors that recycled were much more likely to also recycle than those who didn't have friends and neighbors that recycled.|$|E

Companions who are not in the player's active party stay in the base camp, a hub where the player can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> party members as well as purchase new weapons, armor, and gear. In addition to the main story, the player can learn more about the world of Thedas by collecting the Indexes scattered throughout the game.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Shermer {{points out}} that human beings {{consistently}} choose to consider non-human objects as human whenever they are allowed the chance, a mistake called the anthropomorphic fallacy: They <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> cars, ascribe desire and intentions to natural forces (e.g., [...] "nature abhors a vacuum"), and worship the sun as a human-like being with intelligence. If the Turing test is applied to religious objects, Shermer argues, then, that inanimate statues, rocks, and places have consistently passed the test throughout history. This human tendency towards anthropomorphism effectively lowers the bar for the Turing test, unless interrogators are specifically trained to avoid it.|$|E
