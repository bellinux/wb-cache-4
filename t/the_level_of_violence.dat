In late May and June, 173 Serbs had been rounded up, tortured and killed in Nevesinje, and in early June, another 140 Serbs had been killed at Ljubinje. In response, Serbs attacked Ustaše officials and facilities, and conducted raids themselves, killing Muslim villagers.|$|E
5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in major US cities, the 1960s was a turbulent decade for the city. Numerous {{civil rights and}} anti-war protests took place, including large protests led by Marie Hicks to desegregate Girard College. Students took over the Community College of Philadelphia in a sit-in, race riots broke out in Holmesburg Prison, and a 1964 riot along West Columbia Avenue killed two people, injured over 300 and caused around US$3 million in damages. Crime was also a serious problem. Primarily drug-related gang warfare plagued the city, and in 1970 crime was rated the city's number one problem in a City Planning Commission survey. The court system was overtaxed and the tactics {{of the police department}} under Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo were controversial. Frank Rizzo was credited with preventing <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> seen in other cities at the time and was elected mayor in 1971.|$|E

25|$|Many {{conflicts}} {{that result in}} harm and death involve status, reputation, and seemingly trivial insults. Steven Pinker in his book The Blank Slate argues that in non-state societies without a police {{it was very important}} to have a credible deterrence against aggression. Therefore, it was important to be perceived as having a credible reputation for retaliation, resulting in humans to develop instincts for revenge as well as for protecting reputation ("honor"). Pinker argues that the development {{of the state and the}} police have dramatically reduced <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> compared to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important.|$|E
25|$|Armed with pistols, grenades, {{dynamite}} and hand-held bombs, {{the seizure}} of the bank lasted for 14 hours, resulting {{in the deaths of}} ten of the Armenian men and Ottoman soldiers. The Ottoman reaction to the takeover saw further massacres and pogroms of 6,000 Armenians living in Constantinople and also Hamid threatening to level the entire building itself. However, intervention on part of the European diplomats in the city managed to persuade the men to give way, assigning safe passage to the survivors to France. Despite <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> the Turks had wrought, the takeover was reported positively in the European press, praising the men for their courage and the objectives they attempted to accomplish. Nevertheless, aside from issuing a note condemning the pogroms in the city, the European powers did not act on their promises to enforce reforms in the country as future massacres of Armenians continued to take place.|$|E

40|$|This article {{looks at}} the rise of Hindu {{nationalism}} in contemporary India, with a special focus on the eastern city of Kolkata. It argues that while the rise of Hindu nationalism has been a burning problem in recent years, {{it should be noted}} that the problem does not exist uniformly throughout <b>the</b> country. <b>The</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> in relation to Hindu nationalism differ from place to place. Careful attention needs to be paid to this variation which exists within Hindu nationalism, and also to the variation which exists within <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> associated with it. In other words, while events that took place in Gujarat in 2002 may say something about the situation in western India, they do not necessarily reflect the situation in other parts of India, especially the east of the country. With India being a vast country and each part of the country being grounded in a specific context, keeping this variation in mind is extremely important. The data supporting this argument were collected earlier this year from the state of West Bengal...|$|R

Arab resentment at British rule and the influx of Jewish {{immigrants}} (by 1948 one in six Jews in Palestine lived in Jerusalem) boiled over in anti-Jewish riots in Jerusalem in 1920, 1929, and the 1930s that caused significant damage and several deaths. The Jewish community organized self-defense forces {{in response to the}} Jerusalem pogrom of April 1920 and later disturbances; while other Jewish groups carried out bombings and attacks against the British, especially in response to suspected complicity with the Arabs and restrictions on immigration during World WarII imposed by the White Paper of 1939. <b>The</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> continued to escalate throughout the 1930s and 1940s.

In the following weeks, protests spread to other sixty Romanian cities and dozens of cities in the Romanian diaspora. In Bucharest, the largest protest took place on 19 January, when up to 20,000 people expressed their disagreements with Băsescu regime. Several days, Bucharest faced widespread rioting and acts of vandalism. Thousands of policemen and gendarmes were deployed on the streets to confront angry demonstrators that stoned the vehicles of the law enforcers, vandalized shops and burned cars. Riot police used tear gas and flares to repel demonstrators who blocked traffic in the center of Bucharest. According to the Gendarmerie, destructions were caused by football ultras infiltrated among peaceful demonstrators. During these days of turmoil, several protesters entered the Romanian Television headquarters to blame the broadcaster for censorship. Official figures indicated over 60 injuries during clashes between police and protesters, while up to 283 arrests were made. Several journalists were injured while transmitting live the events. South East Europe Media Organisation, a NGO that has its headquarters in Vienna, expressed concern about <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> against reporters who covered the protests.|$|E
