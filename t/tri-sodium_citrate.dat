50|$|In 1914, the Belgian doctor Albert Hustin and the Argentine {{physician}} and researcher Luis Agote successfully used sodium citrate as an anticoagulant in blood transfusions, with Richard Lewisohn determining its correct concentration in 1915. It {{continues to be}} used today in blood collection tubes and {{for the preservation of}} blood in blood banks. The citrate ion chelates calcium ions in the blood by forming calcium citrate complexes, disrupting the blood clotting mechanism. Recently <b>Tri-sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> has also been used as a locking agent in vascath and haemodialysis lines instead of heparin due to its lower risk of systemic anticoagulation.|$|E

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{effective}} {{approach to the}} aqueous phase synthesis of crystalline silver nanorods and nanowires is demonstrated, using which their diameters and spect ratios can be effectively controlled. The synthesis involves a template-less and non-seed process to high-quality nanoparticles, which is low-cost and proceeds at moderate temperatures.

Electrocatalytically active Ni-W alloy {{coatings}} {{have been}} developed through compositionally versatile electrodeposition method on copper substrate from <b>tri-sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> bath, using glycerol as the additive.
