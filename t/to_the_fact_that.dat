5|$|Only one runestone {{mentioning}} the Byzantine Empire {{has been found}} on Gotland. This may be due both <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> few rune stones were raised on Gotland in favour of image stones, as well as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the Gotlanders dealt mainly in trade, paying a yearly tribute to the Swedes for military protection.|$|E

5|$|According to the behind-the-scenes {{documentary}} {{portions of}} the film's DVD, there were slight continuity problems during the filming of the fight. This {{was said to have}} been due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> real punches were thrown by both Stallone and Tarver, resulting in some swelling and nosebleeds earlier than scripted. The DVD release features an alternate ending in which Rocky wins the fight.|$|E
5|$|Another myth {{surrounding}} this species {{is that it}} occasionally catches small monkeys and other large animals in its pitchers. Such tales have persisted {{for a very long}} time, but can probably be explained as rodents being mistaken for other species. It {{is interesting to note that}} one common name for Nepenthes plants is 'Monkey Cups'. The name refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> monkeys have been observed drinking rainwater from these plants.|$|E

5|$|At {{no point}} during The Wrath of Khan are Khan and Kirk {{in the same}} location; they {{speak to each other}} only over {{communication}} links such as view screens. This was due in part <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the set of the Reliant was a redress of the Enterprise bridge, and the two actors' scenes were filmed four months apart. Montalbán recited his lines with a script assistant instead of to William Shatner.|$|E

5|$|Cornwallis was {{sensitive}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Tipu {{was likely to}} deny the invading army access to local forage and provisions, so he made arrangements for a large supply of provisions and arranged {{for the use of}} elephants to assist in the movement of the army's siege equipment.

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 16th century, Europeans' {{interest}} in the New World revolved around gold and silver and not tobacco.

The harder ivory of the forest elephant makes for more enhanced carving and demands a heavier price on the black market. This preference is best evident in Japan; this is where harder ivory has nearly monopolized the trade for some time. Premium quality bachi, a traditional Japanese plucking tool used for string instruments, are contrived exclusively from forest elephants tusks.|$|R
