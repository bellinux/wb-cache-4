5000|$|Sunshine {{duration}} {{follows a}} general geographic pattern: dry {{areas in the}} subtropical latitudes (about 25° to 40° north/south) have the highest sunshine values, because these are the locations of <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> subtropical high pressure systems, associated with the large-scale descent of air from the upper-level tropopause. Many of the world's driest climates are found adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> subtropical highs, which create stable atmospheric conditions, little convective overturning, and little moisture and cloud cover. Desert regions, with nearly constant high pressure aloft and rare condensation—like North Africa, the Southwestern United States, Western Australia, and the Middle East—are examples of hot, sunny, dry climates where sunshine duration values are very high.|$|R

5|$|Mount Elbert {{is part of}} the Sawatch Range, an uplift of the Laramide Orogeny which {{separated}} from the Mosquito Range to the east around 28 million years ago. The tops of this range were heavily glaciated, leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues. For example, the base of Elbert on <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>side</b> exhibits large igneous and metamorphic rocks deposited when the glaciers receded, which lie on a lateral moraine. Further up <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>side</b> there is a large cirque with a small tarn. There are also lakes to both the north and south, Turquoise and Twin Lakes respectively; the Twin Lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines, and Turquoise Lake was created by the manmade Sugar Loaf Dam.|$|E

5|$|On <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>side</b> of the pyramid, {{the ruins}} of a small {{satellite}} pyramid as well as of a mortuary temple have been discovered. Both have been heavily affected by stone robbing, which started as early as the New Kingdom and reached a climax during the Saite (664–525 BCE) and Persian (525–402 BCE) periods, making a modern reconstruction of the temple layout impossible.|$|E
