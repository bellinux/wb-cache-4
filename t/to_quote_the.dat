In his biography in the Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Suetonius attests to Domitian's ability <b>to</b> <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> important poets and writers such as Homer or Virgil on appropriate occasions, and describes him as a learned and educated adolescent, with elegant conversation. Among his first published works were poetry, as well as writings on law and administration.|$|E
5|$|Yichang was keen for {{his eldest}} son to gain a basic {{education}} rooted in Confucianism, the dominant moral ideology of Chinese society; he deemed a knowledge of Confucian teaching to be essential in allowing his son to develop key business and administrative skills. His hope was that Zedong would gain an apprenticeship with a Xiangtan rice merchant before taking over the family business and supporting his parents during their old age. Yichang was particularly adamant {{on the need to}} learn about Confucianism after losing a lawsuit over a parcel of land; he believed that his opponent had been victorious in the dispute {{as a result of their}} ability <b>to</b> <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> sayings of ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius throughout their argument.|$|E

The two notable exceptions were Titus Andronicus and Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Of the former, Hazlitt nevertheless respected Schlegel's defence of it enough <b>to</b> <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> latter at length.

500|$|The same {{qualification}} {{rules were}} {{in place for the}} 1954 FIFA World Cup, with the 1954 British Home Championship acting as a qualifying group. Scotland again finished second, but this time the SFA allowed a team to participate in the Finals, held in Switzerland. <b>To</b> <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> SFA website, [...] "The preparation was atrocious". The SFA only sent 13 players to the finals, even though FIFA allowed 22-man squads. Despite this self-imposed hardship in terms of players, the SFA dignitaries travelled in numbers, accompanied by their wives. Scotland lost 1–0 against Austria in their first game in the finals, which prompted the team manager Andy Beattie to resign hours before the game against Uruguay. Uruguay were reigning champions and had never before lost a game at the World Cup finals, and they defeated Scotland 7–0.|$|E

500|$|Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissent, {{with which}} Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer joined. Justice David Souter joined all {{sections}} of Stevens' dissent besides {{a critique of}} previous decision of the Supreme Court in arbitration case law. Stevens examined the history of arbitration {{and the purpose of}} it throughout the century. The Federal Arbitration Act was designed, he explained, to maintain the enforceability of contractual agreements. But private arbitration is a whole other situation. Stevens wrote, [...] "As the history of the legislation indicates, the potential disparity in bargaining power between individual employees and large employers was the source of organized labor’s opposition to the Act, which it feared would require courts to enforce unfair employment contracts". He went on <b>to</b> <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> former Chief Justice of the Israeli Supreme Court, Aharon Barak in supporting the idea that the Court should look at the purpose of the act rather than its pure statutory language.|$|E
500|$|At Indianapolis, Hogan led at the bat, and {{contemporary}} sources indicate his performance improved. [...] "Marty Hogan, who is playing temporarily in middle {{field for the}} Indianapolis team of the western league...is covering himself in glory with his superb playing", the Vindicator reported on June 4, 1895. [...] "The Indianapolis Sentinel of May 31st says: Hogan made a great record at the bat yesterday morning", the newspaper added. [...] "One of the drives was for a home run {{and three of the}} hits were bunts". [...] In addition, the article credited Hogan with four runs, five base hits, and two put outs in a late morning game against a rival team from St. Paul, Minnesota. [...] The Vindicator went on <b>to</b> <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> Indianapolis Journal as follows: [...] "Among the features of the forenoon game was Hogan's batting. [...] He got five hits, one a home run, and his bunting was even cleverer than usual, and that is saying a great deal".

500|$|McCreary {{introduced}} a new Hydra theme for the season, explaining that [...] "Last season got pretty musically complicated.

I had a theme for Victoria Hand that, while the audience briefly suspected her, also functioned as the Hydra Theme. I had a theme for Garrett that also acted like the theme for Hydra. It got so complicated ... The answer was obvious: I needed to write a new Hydra Theme, one that could be associated with Dr. Whitehall." [...] For Hayley Atwell's appearances as Peggy Carter, McCreary decided <b>to</b> <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> Agent Carter theme composed by Christopher Lennertz for the Agent Carter short film. On using Lennertz's theme, McCreary said, [...] "I was excited {{for the opportunity to}} incorporate his music into my S.H.I.E.L.D. score, because it further cements the Marvel [...] Universe together as a coherent whole ...

Chris was thrilled and sent me his scores for reference." [...] On his use of the theme, McCreary stated, as Carter [...] "storms in, the first violins state an elongated version of her theme soaring above an aggressive, orchestral ostinato". McCreary also introduced a new Hydra theme in the episode that represents Daniel Whitehall, and is used in scenes featuring the Obelisk and Carl Creel. About the theme, McCreary said [...] "In true bad-guy-theme fashion, the theme is constructed from distantly related minor chords, and contains lots of close intervals. I build a theme like this so it can easily [...] into increasingly dissonant variations. For example, the E in the C minor chord will clash against the E minor, as will the B in the G minor chord. Building the theme in this way means that, in the future, I can put this theme over any pedal tone bass note and it will always sound dissonant." ...|$|E
