From the beginning, the new school suffered from a chronic lack of funds.

[...] "Abridged {{biography}} of Miss Prudence Cowley, fifth daughter of Archdeacon Cowley of Little Missendell, Suffolk. Miss Cowley left the delights (and drudgeries) {{of her home}} life early in the war and came up to London, where she entered an officers' hospital. First month: Washed up six hundred and forty-eight plates every day. Second month: Promoted to drying aforesaid plates. Third month: Promoted <b>to</b> <b>peeling</b> potatoes. Fourth month: Promoted to cutting bread and butter. Fifth month: Promoted one floor up to duties of wardmaid with mop and pail. Sixth month: Promoted to waiting at table. Seventh month: Pleasing appearance and nice manners so striking that am promoted to waiting on the Sisters! Eighth month: Slight check in career. Sister Bond ate Sister Westhaven's egg! Grand row! Wardmaid clearly to blame! Inattention in such important matters cannot be too highly censured. Mop and pail again! How are the mighty fallen! Ninth month: Promoted to sweeping out wards, where I found {{a friend of my}} childhood in Lieutenant Thomas Beresford (bow, Tommy!), whom I had not seen for five long years. The meeting was affecting! Tenth month: Reproved by matron for visiting the pictures in company with one of the patients, namely: the aforementioned Lieutenant Thomas Beresford. Eleventh and twelfth months: Parlourmaid duties resumed with entire success. At {{the end of the year}} left hospital in a blaze of glory. After that, the talented Miss Cowley drove successively a trade delivery van, a motor-lorry and a general! The last was the pleasantest. He was quite a young general!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Homemade ajvar is made {{of roasted}} peppers, while some {{industrial}} producers use cooked peppers, {{which leads to a}} lower quality. The preparation of ajvar is somewhat difficult, as it involves a great amount of manual labour, especially related <b>to</b> <b>peeling</b> the roasted peppers. Traditionally, it is prepared in mid-autumn, when bell peppers are most abundant, and is conserved in glass jars for consumption throughout the year—though in most households stocks do not last until the spring, when fresh salads start to emerge anyway, so it is usually enjoyed as a winter food. Often, the whole family or neighbours gather to bake the bell peppers, peel them, and cook them. The principal cultivar of pepper used is called roga (i.e. [...] "horned"). Roga is large, red, horn-shaped, with thick flesh and relatively easy to peel. It typically ripens in late September.|$|E

50|$|The burial mound on Agri Bavnehøj is {{made from}} {{approximately}} 650.000 blocks of stacked turf blocks giving the mound a height of 5 - 6 meters. Building a mound this seize corresponds <b>to</b> <b>peeling</b> the top turf away from around 7 hectares of land. The construction of large bronze age mounds such as Agri Bavnehøj is an undertaking that must have involved many people working with primitive pre-iron age tools. The Agri mound {{was part of a}} civilisation that built the 60.000 bronze age mounds registered in Denmark today. It has been calculated that in the bronze age period from 1800 - 500 BC, 100 - 150 burial mounds were built every year. This {{can be seen as a}} testimony to the existence of organized communities in a 2500 - 3800 year old pre Christian civilization, that must have had a pervasive religious belief containing a uniform concept of burial traditions.|$|E

5000|$|One {{strategy}} {{that has been}} developed by curlers {{in response to the}} Free Guard Zone (Kevin Martin from Alberta {{is one of the best}} examples) is the [...] "tick" [...] game, where a shot is made attempting to knock (tick) the guard to the side, far enough that it is difficult or impossible to use but still remaining in play while the shot itself goes out of play. The effect is functionally identical <b>to</b> <b>peeling</b> the guard but significantly harder, as a shot that hits the guard too hard (knocking it out of play) results in its being replaced, while not hitting it hard enough can result in its still being tactically useful for the opposition. There's also a greater chance that the shot will miss the guard entirely because of the greater accuracy required to make the shot. Because of the difficulty of making this type of shot, only the best teams will normally attempt it, and it does not dominate the game the way the peel formerly did. Steve Gould from Manitoba popularized ticks played across the face. These are easier to make because they impart less speed on the object stone, therefore increasing the chance that it remains in play even if a bigger chunk of it is hit.|$|E

She deflty moved from traditional film, animation and visual effects to the digital production process in an ever-shifting and fickle industry. She applies this deftness to her installation artwork. A fine example is, [...] "Cloudwoman", shown at the old Los Angeles Jail in 1998. It was a collaborative work with Jael Lehmann and Ann Monn that gave voice to Olive Oatman who became Cloudwoman. Another work of interest is a digital print series she created entitled, [...] "Virtual Species or Digital Waste" [...] (2005), that was developed out of small discarded and unused scraps of texture patches salvaged from the digital dustbins of the digital film making process. This discarded digital trash is called [...] "digitritus," [...] (digital ditritus). She likens it <b>to</b> <b>peeling</b> paint or bark that inspires you to create something else out of it. She has presented, written and published about copyright issues in regards to this work. Her masters in art studies were at the California Institute of the Arts in the Art Program.
