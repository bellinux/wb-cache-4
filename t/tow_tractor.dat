40|$|Abstract—Based on the {{analysis}} of the structure and the power transmission system of aircraft <b>towing</b> <b>tractor,</b> a new project applying hydraulic drive hybrid power is put forward considering the requirements of towing aircraft and working process without towbar. As the testing and controlling signals of the system are multi channel and distributed, the testing program is designed via LXI bus. The experimental data indicate both the pressure change of accumulators and the capacity change of the hydraulic pump/motor are ideal. All the data are in good agreement with expectation. The research may highlight the design for a new generation aircraft <b>towing</b> <b>tractor.</b> Index Terms—LXI, Aircraft <b>towing</b> <b>tractor,</b> Hydraulic drive, Hybrid power, pump/motor I...|$|R

Many UPS trucks still use the 300 to this day.|$|E
50|$|Some fuel {{must still}} be burned to operate the {{auxiliary}} power unit to provide electrical and pneumatic power to run lighting, environmental and communications systems, unless the tug itself provides these sources of power, which some do. This method also places a larger workload on ground crews and equipment, especially if the aircraft and <b>tow</b> <b>tractor</b> ends up having to wait {{in a long line}} of aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{generation}} {{was designed and}} delivered in 1968 to the Air Force by the Oshkosh Truck Corporation. The vehicle was required for the new C5 family of aircraft. Oshkosh delivered a total of 45 vehicles under that contract. Since then, several manufacturer's have produced the U-30 vehicle, to include Stewart & Stevenson and FMC Technologies (now JBT AeroTech). The Air Force also purchases remanufactured U-30 tow tractors. Melton Sales and Service of Bordentown, New Jersey currently has this contract in which three variants of the U-30 <b>tow</b> <b>tractor</b> are overhauled.|$|E

5000|$|WheelTug is an in-wheel {{electric}} taxi {{system under}} development {{by a company}} of the same name. The system enables airplanes to taxi forward and backward without needing a <b>tow</b> <b>tractor</b> or using main jet engines. WheelTug accomplishes this goal through twin electric motors installed in the nose wheels; these motors are powered by the aircraft's Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). According to Aviation Week, the WheelTug system will provide particular savings in ground turnaround time and increased aircraft utilization. Reductions in fuel usage, engine and brake wear, emissions and other expenses will also contribute to net savings. Lowered emissions are especially important in light of research showing that electric taxiing may reduce emissions by 40% compared to traditional dual-engine taxiing.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{ground crew}} {{at the airport}} work at the {{aircraft}}. A <b>tow</b> <b>tractor</b> pulls the aircraft {{to one of the}} airbridges, The ground power unit is plugged in. It keeps the electricity running in the plane when it stands at the terminal. The engines are not working, therefore they do not generate the electricity, as they do in flight. The passengers disembark using the airbridge. Mobile stairs can give the ground crew more access to the aircraft's cabin. There is a cleaning service to clean the aircraft after the aircraft lands. Flight catering provides the food and drinks on flights. A toilet waste truck removes the human waste from the tank which holds the waste from the toilets in the aircraft. A water truck fills the water tanks of the aircraft. A fuel transfer vehicle transfers aviation fuel from fuel tanks underground, to the aircraft tanks. A tractor and its dollies bring in luggage from the terminal to the aircraft. They also carry luggage to the terminal if the aircraft has landed, and is being unloaded. Hi-loaders lift the heavy luggage containers to the gate of the cargo hold. The ground crew push the luggage containers into the hold. If it has landed, they rise, the ground crew push the luggage container on the hi-loader, which carries it down. The luggage container is then pushed on one of the tractors dollies. The conveyor, which is a conveyor belt on a truck, brings in the awkwardly shaped, or late luggage. The airbridge is used again by the new passengers to embark the aircraft. The <b>tow</b> <b>tractor</b> pushes the aircraft away from the terminal to a taxi area. The length of time an aircraft remains on the ground in between consecutive flights is known as [...] "turnaround time". Airlines pay great attention to minimizing turnaround times {{in an effort to keep}} aircraft utilization (flying time) high, with times scheduled as low as 25 minutes for jet aircraft operated by low-cost carriers on narrow-body aircraft.|$|E

50|$|By the 20th century, {{electric}} cars and rail transport were commonplace, with commercial electric automobiles having {{the majority of}} the market. Over time their general-purpose commercial use reduced to specialist roles, as platform trucks, forklift trucks, ambulances, <b>tow</b> <b>tractors</b> and urban delivery vehicles, such as the iconic British milk float; for most of the 20th century, the UK was the world's largest user of electric road vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The Model 50-50, {{introduced}} in 1955, {{was the first}} truck created specifically for the hauling of concrete.

Oshkosh has also produced aircraft <b>tow</b> <b>tractors,</b> and in 1968 the company designed and built the U-30, 45 of which were built for the U.S. Air Force to tow the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft.|$|R

In this paper, the loads at the nose landing gears during towbarless towing operations are described based on extensive measurements and on analytical investigations.

Fatigue load spectra for towbarless towing and push-back operations {{were derived from}} operational measurements and are compared with load spectra for towbar operations. Recommendations are presented how the operational loads can be reduced by an appropriate design of towbarless tractors.
