5000|$|Furthermore, {{male and}} female workers of B. affinis also differ in terms <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{appearance}} and body size. Male workers are typically slightly larger than females (13 - 17.5 mm in length), and have a few off-white/pale hairs present on <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heads. [...] They also have black hair which sometimes streaks across the <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> abdomens (which are typically yellow). [...] Finally, males can even have pale yellow hair on their abdomens, {{as opposed to the}} normal shade of yellow observed in females and queens.|$|R
5|$|Most {{species of}} the Hydrophiinae are able to respire through the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> skin. This is unusual for reptiles, because their skin is thick and scaly, but {{experiments}} with the black-and-yellow sea snake, Pelamis platura (a pelagic species), have shown this species can satisfy about 25% of its oxygen requirements in this manner, which allows for prolonged dives.|$|E
5|$|Well-known {{species such}} as the great white shark, tiger shark, blue shark, mako shark, {{thresher}} shark, and hammerhead shark are apex predators—organisms at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> underwater food chain. Many shark populations are threatened by human activities.|$|E
5|$|After {{undergoing}} {{neck surgery}} that {{forced him to}} miss the entire 2011 season, Manning was released by the Colts and signed with the Denver Broncos. Serving as the team's starting quarterback from 2012 to 2015, he contributed to the Broncos reaching the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> division each year and his playing career concluded with a victory in Super Bowl 50.|$|E

5|$|American Continental went {{bankrupt}} in April 1989, and Lincoln {{was seized by}} the FHLBB on April 14, 1989. About 23,000 customers were left with worthless bonds. Many investors, often ones living in California retirement communities, lost their life savings, and felt emotional damage for having been duped on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> financial devastation. The total bondholder loss came to between $250 million and $288 million. The federal government was eventually liable for $3.4 billion to cover Lincoln's losses when it seized the institution.|$|E

5|$|Both ships {{had taken}} minor damage {{from their own}} muzzle blasts, and Glorious {{required}} five days of repairs. Courageous fired 92 rounds of 15-inch while Glorious fired 57, scoring only the single hit on Pillau between them. They also fired 180 and 213 four-inch shells respectively. Courageouss mine fittings were removed after the battle and both ships received flying-off platforms on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> turrets in 1918. A Sopwith Camel was carried on the rear turret and a Sopwith 1½ Strutter on the forward turret.|$|E

50|$|The {{fourth and}} final round was the Finals. Each final {{determined}} a set of rankings. The A final determined the medals, {{along with the rest}} of the places through 6th. The B final gave rankings from 7th to 12th, the C from 13th to 18th, and so on. Thus, to win a medal rowers had to finish in the <b>top</b> four <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heat, <b>top</b> three <b>of</b> <b>their</b> quarterfinal, and <b>top</b> three <b>of</b> <b>their</b> A/B semifinal to reach the A final.|$|R

5|$|Fossils of the troodonts Mei and Sinornithoides {{demonstrate}} that some dinosaurs slept {{with their heads}} tucked under their arms. This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds. Several deinonychosaur and oviraptorosaur specimens have also been found preserved on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> nests, likely brooding in a bird-like manner. The ratio between egg volume and body mass of adults among these dinosaurs suggest that the eggs were primarily brooded by the male, and that the young were highly precocial, similar to many modern ground-dwelling birds.|$|E
5|$|Four {{wins and}} a draw {{at home to}} Basel placed Barcelona on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> group with a game to spare, and despite defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk on Matchday 6, they still had the third-best record amongst the qualifiers for the first {{knockout}} round. As group winners, Barcelona would avoid being drawn with other group winners, including Manchester United, Liverpool, Juventus and Bayern Munich, but they could still be drawn against runners-up such as Chelsea, Internazionale and Arsenal. The draw eventually paired them with Olympique Lyonnais and, as group winners, they were given the right to play the second leg at home.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} episode, both St-Pierre and Koscheck had Johnson at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lists {{when it came}} time to select fighters. During the team {{selection}} process however, St-Pierre created a fake list which did not have Johnson among his top selections, and subtly showed it to Koscheck to fool him into believing it. This seemed to manipulate Koscheck into picking Marc Stevens, as he may have believed he could take Johnson later. This allowed St-Pierre to choose Johnson with the second overall pick.|$|E

5|$|Mike England was {{convinced}} that choosing Ninian Park as the venue {{was a factor in}} Wales failing to secure the win they needed, given the team's record when playing at Wrexham, and has criticised the FAW for making the choice. Wales played two more home games that season against teams that had qualified for the World Cup by finishing <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> qualifying groups. On 16 October, Hungary came to Ninian Park and won 3–0, while on 21 April 1986, Wales's final home game that season saw them gain a 0–0 draw against Uruguay at the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham.|$|E

On 14 December 2006 the Football Association of Ireland pledged financial assistance for the Hoops’ High Court battle involving Thomas Davis.|$|E
5|$|Upon Marcello Lippi's return, Buffon was {{confirmed}} {{as the starting}} goalkeeper. He played all three group matches during Italy's disappointing 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup campaign in South Africa, in which they finished third in their group in three-way three-point tie. He earned his 100th cap on 14 November 2009 in a friendly match against the Netherlands.

5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, the Indians {{opened up the}} game. Boudreau and Joe Gordon hit {{back-to-back}} singles, which brought Keltner to the plate. The Red Sox expected a bunt, but instead the third baseman hit his 31st home run of the season to put the Indians ahead, 4–1. Galehouse was then replaced with Ellis Kinder, who was met with a double by Larry Doby. Kinder responded by getting the next three batters out, which brought the score to 5–1 as Doby also scored. After Bearden got three Red Sox out, the Indians started the fifth inning with the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lineup. Mitchell and Eddie Robinson, who came in for Clark, were out. Boudreau then {{stepped up to the}} plate and hit his second home run of the night to make the score 6–1.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match against South Africa, Healy was {{elevated}} two positions to No. 7. Coming in upon {{the fall of}} Cameron, her partner Sarah Elliott was then run out without further addition to the score. Healy hit one boundary and was then out for 8 from 6 balls at 7/151. Her dismissal {{was part of a}} sudden collapse as Australia lost 6/16 including the last four wickets for four runs to be all out for 155 with three balls unused. Healy did not make a dismissal as Australia completed a 22-run win. In the final group match against the West Indies, Healy came in at 6/111 and hit 12 from 8 balls, before being caught from the final ball of the innings as Australia finished on 7/133. She had put on 22 runs in 16 balls with Sthalekar. She caught Deandra Dottin from the bowling of Perry for a golden duck as Australia won by nine runs to finish the group stage unbeaten at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> quartet.|$|E

The pair put on 58 from only 37 balls before Poulton was caught from the first ball of the eighth over. Australia collapsed and lost 6/16 including the last four wickets for four runs to be all out for 155 with three balls unused, before completing a 22-run win. In the final group match against the West Indies, Poulton came in at 1/33 and hit 15 from 13 balls, including three fours. Australia finished on 7/133 and won by nine runs to finish the group stage unbeaten at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> quartet.|$|E
