5|$|A 1754 {{enactment}} introduced up to {{one year}} imprisponment for carrying of daggers and pocket pistols ("tercerols") as well as tough sentencing for cases of attacking or resisting law enforcement with use of these weapons. Mere brandishing of a weapon against a state official was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished</b> by life imprisonment. Wounding a state official would be punished by decapitation, killing of state official by cutting of hand followed by decapitation. Another 1754 enactment limited possibility of shooting within limits of certain cities to licensed shooting ranges, showing early development of sport shooting in the country.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{was delighted}} with his team's win and {{credited}} his opponent's performance. He felt the brawl in stoppage time was {{born out of}} Arsenal's frustration after going behind in the match; he did not want either team <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished.</b> Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger apologised for his players' conduct and said he had no regrets over his team selection. Both finalists were fined £100,000 each by The Football Association for their inability to control their players. Emmanuel Eboué was retrospectively banned for three matches as his punch on Wayne Bridge was missed by Howard Webb. Wenger was later found guilty of improper conduct and charged £2,500 for his comments about the linesman.|$|E
5|$|Declan meets Mickey Gannon (Fletcher O'Leary) {{and tries}} to help him out. Rebecca is {{revealed}} to be Oliver Barnes' mother and Declan eventually gets to meet his brother. Rebecca starts dating Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) and she and Declan move into Ramsay Street. Declan meets Richard and discovers that he raped Rebecca. Declan tries to drown Richard on a fishing trip. When it is revealed that Richard has kidney failure, Declan offers to give Richard one of his kidneys, so he can be kept alive <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished</b> {{for what he did}} to Rebecca. Rebecca refuses to give her permission and Oliver donates his instead. Richard's health grows worse and he dies. Declan and Rebecca attend his funeral.|$|E
50|$|One {{problem with}} the {{hypothesis}} that specific punishment for intentional deception could coevolve with intelligence {{is the fact that}} selective punishment of individuals with certain characteristics selects against the characteristics in question. For example, if only individuals capable of remembering what they had agreed <b>to</b> <b>were</b> <b>punished</b> for breaking agreements, evolution would have selected against the ability to remember what one had agreed to.|$|R

50|$|In 1326 {{the corrupt}} and unpopular judge Roger Beler {{was murdered by}} Eustace Folville and his Gang. On 1 Mar 1326 a warrant for the arrest of the gang <b>was</b> issued <b>to</b> William de Paris and others. The {{only member of the}} gang <b>to</b> ever <b>be</b> <b>punished</b> <b>was</b> Eustace's brother the Rev. Richard Folville, Vicar of Teigh.|$|R
5|$|Kartik {{then made}} {{sporadic}} {{appearances in the}} VB triangular ODI series, playing in four of India's ten matches, as he and Kumble were brought {{in and out of}} the team in an attempt to challenge the Australian superiority. He continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished</b> by the Australian batsmen, taking a total of 1/178 from 26 overs, an economy rate of 6.84. However, he did manage to resist the Australians with the bat; in his only two innings he made 32 not out and 23 as the Indian batting was dismissed for only 203 and 151 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Code sought {{not only}} to {{determine}} what could be portrayed on screen, but also to promote traditional values. Sexual relations outside of marriage could not be portrayed as attractive and beautiful, presented {{in a way that}} might arouse passion, nor be made to seem right and permissible. All criminal action had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished,</b> and neither the crime nor the criminal could elicit sympathy from the audience. Authority figures had to be treated respectfully, and the clergy could not be portrayed as comic characters or villains. Under some circumstances, politicians, police officers and judges could be villains, {{as long as it was}} clear that they were the exception to the rule.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} {{constructed}} sometime between the Dissolution and the Union of the Crowns but the exact date is not known. It was probably constructed {{as a strong}} room to store munitions or provide a secure location if the city walls were breached. This turned the ground floor room into a lock up where troublesome citizens would be thrown until they came before the law <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished.</b> Much about the tower has changed. The wall {{to the right of}} the door is 13th-century, while the dividing wall including the door is 18th-century.|$|E

50|$|Thus many of {{the crimes}} for which the Pillamar <b>are</b> said <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>punished</b> <b>were</b> {{positively}} disproved. It is clear that there did exist refractory nobles of immense power and that Marthanda Varma did {{put an end to}} their authority and made that of the king supreme, but most of the stories about the Pillamar <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> false.|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} {{has been}} positive. TreeHugger called it [...] "important" [...] and [...] "significant," [...] and Environmental Building News praised {{the book as}} [...] "long overdue." [...] Builder magazine wrote that The Shape of Green could [...] "revolutionize what it means <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sustainable." [...] John Elkington has praised it as [...] "a passionate book" [...] and [...] "an inspirational guide to a future we can't wait to embrace."Publishers Weekly also gave a favorable review: [...] "Hosey's underlying argument—that green living doesn't have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>punishing,</b> expensive, or boring—is a refreshing take on an old debate that fans of Malcolm Gladwell and other big thinkers will find informative and illuminating." ...|$|R
5|$|While seducing three female robots, Bender is {{interrupted}} by a knock at his hotel room door. He {{opens the door and}} is knocked unconscious. He awakens to see the Robot Devil and finds himself in Robot Hell. The Robot Devil reminds Bender that he agreed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished</b> for sinning when he joined Robotology. After discovering Bender is missing, Fry and Leela track him down using Nibbler's sense of smell. They eventually find the entrance to Robot Hell in an abandoned amusement park. A musical number starts as the Robot Devil begins detailing Bender's punishment. As the song ends, Fry and Leela arrive and try to reason with the Robot Devil on Bender's behalf.|$|E
5|$|As the {{expensive}} War of the Spanish Succession grew unpopular, {{so did the}} Whig administration. The impeachment of Henry Sacheverell, a high church Tory Anglican who had preached anti-Whig sermons, led to further public discontent. Anne thought Sacheverell ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished</b> for questioning the Glorious Revolution, but that his punishment should only be a mild one to prevent further public commotion. In London, riots broke out in support of Sacheverell, but the only troops available to quell the disturbances were Anne's guards, and Secretary of State Sunderland was reluctant to use them and leave the Queen less protected. Anne declared God would be her guard and ordered Sunderland to redeploy her troops. In line with Anne's views, Sacheverell was convicted, but his sentence—suspension of preaching for three years—was so light as to render the trial a mockery.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{policies}} and practices which resulted in individuals being punished for peacefully exercising their human rights by sending them to RTL have not fundamentally changed: quite the contrary. There is ample evidence that such policies and practices are continuing in full force. The latest anti-Falun Gong campaign, launched earlier this year and intended to operate for three years, shows that the CCP’s determination to rid China of this spiritual group has not abated. Falun Gong practitioners continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished</b> through criminal prosecution and being sent to “brainwashing centres” {{and other forms of}} arbitrary detention. Petitioners likewise continue to be subjected to harassment, forcibly committed to mental institutions and sent to “black jails” and other forms of arbitrary detention. Human rights defenders, democracy advocates, whistle-blowers and other political activists are also being increasingly targeted through criminal detention, “black jails”, short-term administrative detention, and enforced disappearances, rather than RTL.|$|E
5000|$|The {{events of}} Season 2 take place {{two years after}} Season 1. The {{youngest}} son of Captain Ali and Cemile, Osman has started primary school and has {{fallen in love with}} a girl named Gülden. However, their teacher, who also happens <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Mete's teacher in high school, always seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>punishing</b> little Osman because of his supposed naughtiness. Captain Ali is freed from prison after [...] "The General Clemency". However, getting out of jail means almost nothing to him, considering his new lifestyle, poor and miserable, partly due to him raping Cemile, his ex-wife, and arguing and fighting with his children and also being robbed and tricked by Caroline.|$|R
60|$|Dale {{was quick}} in the saddle, {{followed}} by John, but the horses had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> severely <b>punished</b> <b>to</b> force them {{even to a}} trot. And that was a lagging trot, which now did not leave Torn behind.|$|R
5000|$|The first mission {{entrusted}} <b>to</b> Rodas <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>punish</b> {{the tribes}} who had assassinated Valdivia. Having completed this mission, Rodas founded Cáceres in 1576 {{and returned to}} Antioquia. He also attempted to pacify the indigenous peoples at Marequita and at the valley of Aburra. In 1581, he founded Zaragoza de las Palmas.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Percival Graves {{approaches}} Mary Lou Barebone's adopted son Credence {{and offers}} to free {{him from his}} abusive mother. In exchange, Graves wants Credence to find an Obscurus, which he believes has caused the mysterious destructive incidents around the city. Credence finds a wand under his adopted sister Modesty's bed. Mary Lou assumes it is Credence's wand, but Modesty says it is hers. When she is about <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished,</b> the Obscurus attacks and kills Mary Lou and her eldest daughter Chastity. Graves arrives and after Credence leads him {{to the location of}} Modesty, dismisses him as being a Squib and refuses to teach him magic. Credence reveals he is the Obscurus's host, having lived longer than any other host due to the intensity of his magic. In a fit of rage, Credence transforms into an Obscurus and attacks the city.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years after}} the {{inconclusive}} skirmish at Largs, terms of peace were finally agreed upon between the kingdoms of Norway and Scotland. On 2 July 1266, with {{the conclusion of the}} Treaty of Perth, the centuries-old territorial dispute over Scotland's western seaboard was at last settled. Within the treaty, Magnús Hákonarson, King of Norway (died 1280) ceded the Hebrides and Mann to Alexander, who in turn agreed to pay 4,000 merks sterling over four years, and in addition to pay 100 merks sterling in perpetuity. Other conditions stipulated that the inhabitants of the islands would be subject to laws of Scotland; that they were not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished</b> for their actions previous to the treaty; and that they were free to remain or leave their possessions peacefully. In 1266, the Chronicle of Lanercost records that Alexander ruled Mann through appointed bailiffs; Scottish exchequer accounts record that the Sheriff of Dumfries was given allowance for maintaining seven Manx hostages.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of both Yeesha and Esher, the player travels across four Ages, {{collecting}} four slates that unlock the tablet's power. Esher occasionally appears in the Ages to offer his counsel, or reveal the histories of his people and the worlds the player explores. Once all four slates are collected, Esher requests that the player bring the tablet {{to him in the}} now-unlocked Age of Myst. The player is then returned to K'veer, where they have four possible choices. Travelling to Myst without the tablet will cause Esher to angrily abandon the player with no way out. If Esher is given the tablet, he will explain he wishes to use the tablet for domination, and will also leave the player trapped. If the player gives the tablet to Yeesha, the tablet simply slips through her hands and disappears into the ground; she walks away, disappointed, leaving the player trapped in D'ni. The only good ending involves giving the Bahro the tablet, ending their enslavement. Arriving at Releeshahn, the new home Age of the D'ni, Yeesha and Atrus thank the player and speak of a new chapter for the D'ni people; Esher is handed over to the Bahro <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished</b> for his crimes. The game ends on a visit to Releeshahn.|$|E

50|$|Most urban {{public school}} systems, even {{in states where}} it is permitted, have {{abolished}} corporal punishment. Statistics collected {{by the federal government}} show that the use of corporal punishment in schools has been gradually declining. It is still common in some schools in rural and suburban areas of the South, however, and more than 167,000 students were paddled in the 2011-2012 school year in American public schools according to statistics from the United States Department of Education. One study found that African-American students were more likely than either White or Hispanic students <b>to</b> <b>be</b> physically <b>punished,</b> by 2.5 times and 6.5 times, respectively, and boys were 3.4 times more likely than girls <b>to</b> <b>be</b> physically <b>punished</b> in school.|$|R
5|$|At this hill, the Sabines, {{creeping}} to the Citadel, were let {{in by the}} Roman maiden Tarpeia. For this treachery, Tarpeia was {{the first}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished</b> by being flung from a steep cliff overlooking the Roman Forum. This cliff was later named the Tarpeian Rock after the Vestal Virgin, and became a frequent execution site. The Sabines, who immigrated to Rome following the Rape of the Sabine Women, settled on the Capitoline. The Vulcanal (Shrine of Vulcan), an 8th-century BC sacred precinct, occupied much of the eastern lower slopes of the Capitoline, {{at the head of}} what would later become the Roman Forum. The summit was the site of a temple for the Capitoline Triad, started by Rome's fifth king, Tarquinius Priscus (r. 616-579 BC), and completed by the seventh and last king, Tarquinius Superbus (535–496 BC). It was considered {{one of the largest and}} the most beautiful temples in the city (although little now remains). The city legend starts with the recovery of a human skull (the word for head in Latin is caput) when foundation trenches were being dug for the Temple of Jupiter at Tarquin's order. Recent excavations on the Capitoline uncovered an early cemetery under the Temple of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|In early 1914, Ruth {{signed a}} {{professional}} baseball contract with Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team. The circumstances of Ruth's signing {{are not known}} with certainty; historical fact is obscured by stories that cannot all be true. By some accounts, Dunn was urged to attend a game between an all-star team from St. Mary's and one from another Xaverian facility, Mount St. Mary's College. Some versions have Ruth running away before the eagerly awaited game, to return in time <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished,</b> and then pitching St. Mary's to victory as Dunn watched. Others have Washington Senators pitcher Joe Engel, a Mount St. Mary's graduate, pitching in an alumni game after watching a preliminary contest between the college's freshmen and a team from St. Mary's, including Ruth. Engel watched Ruth play, then told Dunn about him at a chance meeting in Washington. Ruth, in his autobiography, stated only that he worked out for Dunn for a half-hour, and was signed. According to biographer Kal Wagenheim, there were legal difficulties to be straightened out as Ruth was supposed to remain at the school until he turned 21.|$|E
