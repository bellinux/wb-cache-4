40|$|An {{approach}} is presented for {{the generation of}} two-dimensional, structured, dynamic <b>grids.</b> <b>The</b> <b>grid</b> motion {{may be due to}} the motion of the boundaries of the computational domain or to the adaptation of <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> to <b>the</b> transient, physical solution. A time-dependent grid is computed through the time integration of <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> speeds which are computed from a system of <b>grid</b> speed equations. <b>The</b> <b>grid</b> speed equations are derived from the time-differentiation of <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> equations so as to ensure that <b>the</b> dynamic <b>grid</b> maintains <b>the</b> desired qualities of <b>the</b> static <b>grid.</b> <b>The</b> <b>grid</b> equations are <b>the</b> Euler-Lagrange equations derived from a variational statement for <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b> <b>The</b> dynamic <b>grid</b> method is demonstrated for a model problem involving boundary motion, an inviscid flow in a converging-diverging nozzle during startup, and a viscous flow over a flat plate with an impinging shock wave.

50|$|Thermal {{radiation}} from the cathode heats <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b> As a result, low-work-function cathode material evaporates and condenses on <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b> This eventually leads to a short between cathode and <b>grid,</b> as <b>the</b> material accreting on <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> narrows <b>the</b> gap {{between it and the}} cathode. In addition, the emissive cathode material on <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> causes a negative grid current (reverse electron flow from <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> to <b>the</b> cathode). This can swamp <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> power supply if this reverse current gets too high, changing <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> (bias) voltage and, consequently, the operating point of the tube. Today's IOTs are equipped with coated cathodes that work at relatively low operating temperatures, and hence have slower evaporation rates, minimizing this effect.|$|R

25|$|A 2009 {{paper by}} Prof R. Balasubramaniam of the Indian Institute of Technology found Barraud's {{explanation}} of the dimensional errors and the transition between the 23 and 17 gaz grid at the great gate unconvincing. Balasubramaniam conducted dimensional analysis of the complex based on Barraud's surveys. He concluded that the Taj was constructed using the ancient Aṅgula as the basic unit rather than the Mughal 'gaz', noted in the contemporary accounts. The Aṅgula, which equates to 1.763cm and the Vistasti (12 Angulams) were first mentioned in the Arthashastra in c. 300BC {{and may have been}} derived from the earlier Indus Valley Civilisation. In this analysis the forecourt and caravanserai areas were set out with a 60 Vistasti grid, and the riverfront and garden sections with a 90-vistari grid. The transition between <b>the</b> <b>grids</b> is more easily accommodated, 90 being easily divisible by 60. The research suggests that older, pre-Mughal methods of proportion were employed as ordering principles in the Taj.|$|E

Consequently, Rossi decided to turn his group's efforts towards its study. With Herbert Bridge, Rossi designed and tested a plasma probe based on the classical Faraday cup. [...] However, to enhance the instrument's response to positively charged protons and to suppress its response to photoelectrons produced by sunlight, four grids were deployed within the cup. [...] A key innovation was a modulating voltage applied to one of <b>the</b> <b>grids,</b> which converted the signal into an alternating current, proportional to the proton flux and uncontaminated by any contribution of photoelectrons.|$|E

50|$|The Barkhausen-Kurz tube was a triode {{operated}} with <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> (a thin mesh of wires) at {{a positive}} potential relative {{to both the}} cathode (or filament) and the anode (or plate).

2500|$|The {{electrons}} then {{pass through}} a second cavity, called the [...] "catcher", through a similar pair of grids {{on each side of}} the cavity.

[...] The bunches of electrons passing through excite standing waves in the cavity, which has the same resonant frequency as the buncher cavity. [...] Each bunch of electrons passes between <b>the</b> <b>grids</b> at a point in the cycle when the exit grid is negative with respect to the entrance grid, so the electric field in the cavity between <b>the</b> <b>grids</b> opposes the electrons motion. [...] The electrons thus do work on the electric field, and are decelerated, their kinetic energy is converted to electric potential energy, increasing the amplitude of the oscillating electric field in the cavity.
