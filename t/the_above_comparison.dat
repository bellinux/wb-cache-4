6000|$|SOME RECENT NOVELISTS. There is a {{difference}} between our earlier and later fiction which becomes apparent when we compare specific examples. As a type of the earlier novel take Cooper's The Spy or Longfellow's Hyperion or Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables or Simms's Katherine Walton or Cooke's The Virginia Comedians, and read it in connection with a recent novel, such as Howells's Annie Kilburn or Miss Jewett's Deephaven or Harold Frederick's Illumination or James Lane Allen's The Reign of Law or Frank Norris's The Octopus. Disregarding the important element of style, we note that the earlier novels have a distant background in time or space; that their chief interest lies in the story they have to tell; that they take us far away from present reality into regions where people are more impressive and sentiments more exalted than in our familiar, prosaic world. The later novels interest us less by the story than by the analysis of character; they deal with human life as it is here and now, not as we imagine it to have been elsewhere or in a golden age. In a word, our later novels are realistic in purpose, and in this respect they are in marked contrast with our novels of an earlier age, which are nearly all of the romantic kind. [Footnote: In <b>the</b> <b>above</b> <b>comparison</b> we have ignored a large number of recent novels that are quite as romantic as any written before the war. Romance is still, as in all past ages, more popular than realism: witness the millions of readers of Lew Wallace, E. P. Roe and other modern romancers.] ...|$|E
6000|$|At last {{we begin}} to get the Major's measure. We are able to put this and that casual fact together, and build the man up before our eyes, and look at him. And after we have got him built, we find him worth the trouble. By <b>the</b> <b>above</b> <b>comparison</b> between his age and Ambulinia's, we guess the war-worn veteran to be twenty-two; and the other facts stand thus: {{he had grown up}} in the Cherokee country with the same equal {{proportions}} as one of the natives--how flowing and graceful the language, and yet how tantalizing as to meaning!--he had been turned adrift by his father, to whom he had been [...] "somewhat of a dutiful son"; he wandered in distant lands; came back frequently [...] "to the scenes of his boyhood, almost destitute of many of the comforts of life," [...] in order to get into the presence of his father's winter-worn locks, and spread a humid veil of darkness around his expectations; but he was always promptly sent back to the cold charity of the combat again; he learned to play the fiddle, and {{made a name for himself}} in that line; he had dwelt among the wild tribes; he had philosophized about the despoilers of the kingdoms of the earth, and found out--the cunning creature--that they refer their differences to the learned for settlement; he had achieved a vast fame as a military chieftain, the Achilles of the Florida campaigns, and then had got him a spelling-book and started to school; he had fallen in love with Ambulinia Valeer while she was teething, but had kept it to himself awhile, out of the reverential awe which he felt for the child; but now at last, like the unyielding Deity who follows the storm to check its rage in the forest, he resolves to shake off his embarrassment, and to return where before he had only worshiped. The Major, indeed, has made up his mind to rise up and shake his faculties together, and to see if HE can't do that thing himself. This is not clear. But no matter about that: there stands the hero, compact and visible; and he is no mean structure, considering that his creator had never structure, considering that his creator had never created anything before, and hadn't anything but rags and wind to build with this time. It seems to me that no one can contemplate this odd creature, this quaint and curious blatherskite, without admiring McClintock, or, at any rate, loving him and feeling grateful to him; for McClintock made him, he gave him to us; without McClintock we could not have had him, and would now be poor.|$|E

The policy implications discussed in the context of Erdös–Rényi random networks remain valid for the considered core-periphery structure.|$|R

Combination 2 shows better performance in DC-link voltage but consumes the maximum reactive power and the inrush current damping is insufficient. Although the combination optimum does not obtain the best performance in any single aspect, it obtains acceptable performance {{in all of these}} aspects due to its better coordination of switching schemes and resistance values, therefore its performances are the global optimal.|$|R

Here, we maintain the anonymous credentials and access key in the highly secured bank authentication server and matching is performed in the cloud authentication server, so that the real login and the authentication data are not revealed to cloud and bank. We use the random strings and ESK for mutual authentication of the users and servers; hence the malicious users cannot pretend to be the authorized users and impersonated requests can be eliminated.|$|R

30|$|From <b>the</b> <b>above</b> <b>comparisons,</b> {{it can be}} {{seen that}} the {{proposed}} method can well reduce the vibrations under different cutting conditions. Chatter due to vibration of a flexible workpiece resulting from the bending displacement is a major obstacle affecting the quality of a workpiece in the milling process. However, bending moment has not been given attention in the literature. This work has provided a means of reducing the severity of the situation. The work considered the spindle speed variation and depth of cut variation. The actuator provides a counterbalance force that minimizes the displacement due to the bending moment, as shown in the figures.|$|R

30|$|From <b>the</b> <b>above</b> <b>comparison,</b> we {{can come}} to a {{conclusion}} that the DCW has better curving performance than the conventional wheelset. Due to the torque of the clutch-type limited slip device, the DCW can also express better self-steering performance than the IRW. Therefore, the DCW processes the good curving performance of an IRW and the self-steering capability of the conventional wheelset.|$|E

For the same functions the average memory size required for processing is also computed. Furthermore the minimum memory size necessary for processing any Boolean function in u canonical clauses by either a partitioned or a non - partitioned list algorithm is computed.

40|$|The Cryogenic Fluid Management Experiment (CFME) was {{analyzed}} {{to assess the}} feasibility and advisability of deleting the vapor cooled shield (VCS) from the baseline CFME insulation and pressure control system. Two alternate concepts of CFME insulation and pressure control, neither of which incorporated the VCS, were investigated. The first concept employed a thermodynamic vent system (TVS) to throttle the flow through an internal wall mounted heat exchanger (HX) within the pressure vessel to decrease boiloff and pressure rise rate, while the second concept utilized a TVS without an internal heat exchanger. Only the first concept was viable. Its performance was assessed for a seven day mission and found to be satisfactory. It was also concluded that VCS development costs would be greater than for an internal HX installation.

40|$|Among several {{techniques}} {{available for}} solving Computational Electromagnetics (CEM) problems, the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method {{is one of}} the best suited approaches when a parallelized hardware platform is used. In this paper we investigate the feasibility of implementing the FDTD method using the NVIDIA ® GT 520, a low cost Graphical Processing Unit (GPU), for solving the differential form of Maxwell’s equation in time domain. Initially a generalized benchmarking problem of bandwidth test and another benchmarking problem of 'matrix left division is discussed for understanding the correlation between the problem size and the performance on the CPU and the GPU respectively. This is further followed by the discussion of the FDTD method, again implemented on both, the CPU and the GT 520 GPU.

30|$|While {{interesting}} and informative, <b>the</b> <b>above</b> <b>comparison</b> {{between the two}} groups of regions does not eliminate concerns about the potential endogeneity of the regional minimum wages, which may lead to biased estimates.

However, this evidence is by no means conclusive. Given our lack of reliable data to address the endogeneity issue in a rigorous way, we leave it for further research.|$|E
