5|$|Lithium {{is useful}} in the {{treatment}} of bipolar disorder. Lithium salts may also be helpful for related diagnoses, such as schizoaffective disorder and cyclic major depression. The active part of these salts is the lithium ion Li+. They may increase the risk of developing Ebstein's cardiac anomaly in infants born to women who take lithium during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>trimester</b> of pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Usually, {{warfarin}} is avoided in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>trimester,</b> and a {{low molecular}} weight heparin such as enoxaparin is substituted. With heparin, risk of maternal haemorrhage and other complications are still increased, but heparins do not cross the placental barrier, so do not cause birth defects. Various solutions exist for the time around delivery.|$|E

5|$|In {{women with}} known {{hypothyroidism}} who become pregnant, {{it is recommended}} that serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine should be used to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>trimester</b> normal range is below 2.5mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0mIU/L. Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the free T4 index. Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according to the appropriate reference range for that stage of pregnancy. The levothyroxine dose often needs to be increased after pregnancy is confirmed, although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that it is not always required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels.|$|E
5|$|The average net {{household}} income (after social, pension {{and health insurance}} contributions) in Paris was €36,085 for 2011. It ranged from €22,095 in the 19th arrondissement to €82,449 in the 7th arrondissement. The median taxable income for 2011 was around €25,000 in Paris and €22,200 for Île-de-France. Generally speaking, incomes are higher in the Western {{part of the city}} and in the western suburbs than in the northern and eastern parts of the urban area. Unemployment was estimated at 8.2 percent in the city of Paris and 8.8 percent in the Île-de-France region in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>trimester</b> of 2015. It ranged from 7.6 percent in the wealthy Essonne department to 13.1 percent in the Seine-Saint-Denis department, where many recent immigrants live.|$|E
5|$|Adverse {{effects from}} {{medications}} {{are reported in}} 10 to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that {{are not related to}} dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>trimester.</b> Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications. Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.|$|E

5|$|The risk {{of disease}} {{can be reduced}} by {{preventing}} mosquito bites {{through the use of}} mosquito nets and insect repellents, or with mosquito control measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water. Several medications are available to prevent malaria in travellers to areas where the disease is common. Occasional doses of the combination medication sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine are recommended in infants and after <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>trimester</b> of pregnancy in areas with high rates of malaria. Despite a need, no effective vaccine exists, although efforts to develop one are ongoing. The recommended treatment for malaria is a combination of antimalarial medications that includes an artemisinin. The second medication may be either mefloquine, lumefantrine, or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Quinine along with doxycycline may be used if an artemisinin is not available. It is recommended that in areas where the disease is common, malaria is confirmed if possible before treatment is started due to concerns of increasing drug resistance. Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications; for example, chloroquine-resistant P.falciparum has spread to most malarial areas, and resistance to artemisinin has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>trimester.</b> Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} the plasma {{levels of the}} renal functional markers creatinine, urate, cystatin C, beta(2) -microglobulin and beta-trace protein in samples from <b>the</b> <b>first,</b> second, early third and late third trimesters of 398 healthy women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies. Material and methods. Plasma samples from 58 healthy non-pregnant women served as controls. The creatinine levels were significantly lower at all time-points in pregnancy, whereas the urate levels were lower during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> and second <b>trimesters</b> but increased in the late third trimester. The cystatin C, beta(2) -microglobulin and beta-trace protein levels displayed similar changes with increased levels in the third trimester but unaltered levels during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> and second <b>trimesters.</b> Results. The results indicate an increased filtration of low-molecular weight molecules during pregnancy, particularly during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> and second <b>trimesters,</b> whereas filtration of 10 - 30 kDa molecules is decreased in the third but unaltered in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> and second <b>trimesters.</b> <b>The</b> levels of albumin and alpha(2) -macroglobulin were measured in the same samples. Conclusions. The albumin levels decreased {{in the second and}} third trimesters, whereas the levels of alpha(2) -macroglobulin were unchanged, which is compatible with a virtually unaltered transfer of alpha(2) -macroglobulin between the intra-and extravascular space during pregnancy and a significantly increased extravascular fraction of albumin...|$|R

40|$|Several viral infections {{have been}} {{reported}} to result in more severe disease in pregnant than non-pregnant women, but the relative risks have not been well characterised. This has now been done for Lassa fever in a prospective study of 68 pregnant and 79 non-pregnant women who were admitted to hospital in Sierra Leone with confirmed Lassa fever. Lassa fever was the main cause of maternal mortality in the hospital, accounting for 25 % of maternal deaths. Twelve of 40 patients in the third trimester died, compared with two of 28 in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two <b>trimesters</b> and 10 of 79 non-pregnant women. The odds ratio for death in the third <b>trimester</b> compared with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two <b>trimesters</b> was 5. 57 (95 % confidence intervals 1. 02 to 30. 26). The condition of the mother improved rapidly after evacuation of the uterus, whether by spontaneous abortion, evacuation of retained products of conception, or normal delivery; 10 of 26 women without uterine evacuation died, but only four of 39 women with evacuation died (p = 0. 0016). The odds ratio for death with pregnancy intact was 5. 47 (95 % confidence interval 1. 35 to 22. 16). Fetal and neonatal loss was 87 %. The risk of death from Lassa fever in the third trimester is significantly higher than that in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two <b>trimesters</b> and higher than that for non-pregnant women, but evacuation of the uterus can significantly improve the mother's chance of survival...|$|R
