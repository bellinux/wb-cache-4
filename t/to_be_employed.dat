5|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach was}} probably the first <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>employed,</b> since it is comparatively easy to destroy weeds by burning them or ploughing them under, and to kill larger competing herbivores. Techniques such as crop rotation, companion planting (also known as intercropping or mixed cropping), and the selective breeding of pest-resistant cultivars have a long history.|$|E
5|$|In the 1770s and 1780s the {{discovery}} of copper at Parys Mountain in Anglesey which could be cheaply extracted by opencast mining led to a crash in the copper price, and expensive deep mining began to become unviable. As the copper boom came to an end, the mines began to close. In 1788 mining ceased at Dolcoath itself, although some bal maidens continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>employed</b> picking through the large quantities of ore which had already {{been brought to the}} surface.|$|E

5|$|Morton {{was educated}} at Lismore High School, which he {{left at the}} age of 14 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>employed</b> in a law firm, but had a varied career in many {{different}} businesses. On 31 March 1937, He married Nance Maude on 31 March 1937 and had two daughters, Patricia and Margaret. Morton moved to Mosman, New South Wales, where {{he was elected to the}} Mosman Municipal Council in December 1944 as an Alderman, rising to become Mayor in 1946. He would remain on council until September 1951.|$|E
5|$|Much later, during World War I in 1916, a {{standardized}} and diluted modification of Labarraque's solution containing hypochlorite (0.5%) and boric acid as an acidic stabilizer, {{was developed by}} Henry Drysdale Dakin (who gave full credit to Labarraque's prior work in this area). Called Dakin's solution, the method of wound irrigation with chlorinated solutions allowed antiseptic treatment {{of a wide variety}} of open wounds, long before the modern antibiotic era. A modified version of this solution continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>employed</b> in wound irrigation in modern times, where it remains effective against bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics (see Century Pharmaceuticals).|$|E
5|$|One of the {{consequences}} of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of employment.

New jobs have appeared, such as gaffer or special effects supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.|$|E

5|$|Philip Henry (Pat) Morton (28 October 191018 January 1999) was an Australian {{businessman}} and politician. Born in Lismore in Northern New South Wales to a prominent political family and educated at Lismore High School, Morton left school at fourteen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>employed</b> {{in a legal}} firm, before branching out into various businesses. Moving to Sydney, Morton first entered politics in 1944 as an Alderman on Mosman Municipal Council, rising to be Mayor in 1946. Morton then entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 3 May 1947, representing the Electoral district of Mosman for the Liberal Party of Australia.|$|E
5|$|A voltage {{applied to}} a human body causes an {{electric}} current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with {{the path of the}} current, but is about 0.1mA to 1mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>employed</b> as a method of torture. Death caused by an electric shock is referred to as electrocution. Electrocution is still the means of judicial execution in some jurisdictions, though its use has become rarer in recent times.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{not usually}} used for gastroenteritis, {{although}} they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>employed,</b> a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates {{of resistance to the}} latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.|$|E

5|$|As {{the players}} empire expands, agents and {{supervisors}} will make themselves available for employment. Agents {{are used for}} gathering intelligence on alien asteroids and can also be deployed on the players own asteroids for counter-intelligence. Other uses for agents include deploying APV's and destroying various buildings such as defense installations, life support, production, and other various installations. The chances of an agent successfully completing their mission and escaping detection are increased {{if there is a}} spy satellite orbiting the asteroid they are assigned to. Colony Supervisors are able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>employed</b> to help manage the building and maintenance of asteroid colonies. There is no research in the game, as this popular mechanic is replaced with the Sci-Tek blueprint system which allows players to buy new technologies as needed. Multiplayer is available over an IPX network with TetraCorp being the only playable race.|$|E
5|$|Barre {{was one of}} {{the main}} royal justices between 1194 and 1199. He also served as a lawyer for the new Bishop of Ely, Eustace, who was elected in August 1197. But Barre had {{incurred}} the hostility of the king's younger brother Prince John, and when John succeeded Richard as king in 1199, Barre ceased <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>employed</b> as a royal justice, instead returning to Ely and business in his clerical office. His last sure mention in the historical record is on 9 August 1202, when he was serving as a judge-delegate for Pope Innocent III, but he may have been alive as late as 1213, as he was part of a papal panel deciding a case that can only be securely dated to between 1198 and 1213. Barre maintained his friendship with Stephen of Tournai, who corresponded with him later in their lives.|$|E
5|$|Heliade inaugurated {{his series}} of {{proposals}} for reforming {{the language in}} 1828, when his work on Romanian grammar called for the Cyrillic script to be reduced to 27 letters, reflecting phonetic spelling (for this rule, Heliade cited {{the example of the}} Latin alphabet as used in Ancient Rome). Soon after, he began a campaign in favor of introducing Romance neologisms, which he wanted to adapt to Romanian spelling. By that time, Romanians in various regions had grown aware of the need to unify the varieties of Romanian and create a standard Romanian lexis: this notion was first supported by the Transylvanians Gheorghe Şincai and Petru Maior, whose proposal was to unite Romanians around the issue of the choice of liturgical language, both Orthodox and Greek-Catholic (see Transylvanian School). Heliade, who first proposed a language regulator (an idea which was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>employed</b> in creating the Romanian Academy), expanded on this legacy, while stressing that the dialect spoken in Muntenia, which had formed the basis of religious texts published by the 16th century printer Coresi, serve as the standard language.|$|E

5|$|In 1942 Hicks {{took a job}} at the Western Electric Company, {{designing}} and testing quartz crystal oscillators in Kearny, New Jersey. She was the first woman <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>employed</b> by Western Electric as an engineer, and she spent three years working there. Upon the death of her father, she joined the Bloomfield, New Jersey based Newark Controls Company, a metalworking firm that her father had founded. Hicks served as chief engineer and then as {{vice president in charge of}} engineering, before purchasing control of the company from her uncle in 1955. Hicks designed and patented a gas density switch later used in the U.S. space program, including the moon landing, and was a pioneer in the field of sensors that detected when devices were reaching structural limits. Hicks authored several technical papers on the gas density switch. While at Newark Controls Hicks pursued a master's degree in physics, which she received in 1949 from the Stevens Institute.|$|E
5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} as a sizar to Trinity College, Cambridge University on 22 November 1780 {{at the age}} of 19. Trinity was at the time the richest college at Cambridge. Sizars were students who were not of the gentlemanly class, who were charged lower fees and obtained free food and/or lodging and other assistance during their period of study in exchange for performing work at their colleges. By the eighteenth century, sizars were fully integrated members of the community, who were as likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>employed</b> by Fellow commoners as companions rather than servants. They were expected to wait at table (as were pensioners and scholars), but by the eighteenth century they had their own gyps (servants) and bedmakers.|$|E
5|$|Scottish Protestantism in {{the seventeenth}} century was highly focused on the Bible, which was seen as infallible and the major source of moral authority.

The seventeenth century marked the high-water mark of kirk discipline. Kirk sessions were able to apply religious sanctions, such as excommunication and denial of baptism, to enforce godly behaviour and obedience. In more difficult cases of immoral behaviour they could work with the local magistrate, in a system modelled on that employed in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{international}} border is firmly established and peaceful; {{there is a}} greater sense of Canadian nationality, and fears of U.S. Manifest Destiny have all but disappeared. Canada and the U.S. have formalized their trading partnership with the North American Free Trade Agreement, leading to increased trade between the two nations. This trade now coursing up and down the valleys of the Red and Mississippi rivers more than fulfils Lord Selkirk's predictions made nearly two centuries ago; while he first sought access over U.S. territory for the succour of his nascent colony, now commerce in manufactures and commodities goes in both directions. The trade corridor once occupied by the long-gone Red River Trails continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>employed</b> for its historic purposes.|$|E
5|$|A week later, the Australians {{followed}} up with attacks on Japanese positions around Weston on the north-eastern part of Brunei Bay. The 1st Armoured Regiment and Armoured Squadron (Special Equipment) operating Matilda II tanks were attached to the Australian 7th Division and {{took part in the}} Battle of Balikpapan which was the concluding stage of the Operation Oboe. The landings took place on 1 July 1945 and had been preceded by heavy bombing and shelling by Australian and US air and naval forces. Landing with the infantry, the tanks—including Matilda tank dozers, newly modified Matilda Frog flamethrower tanks, and a Coventanter bridge-layer—mainly operated in small detachments in close support of the troops, even though the terrain offered the opportunity for more mobile tactics <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>employed.</b> Although the Australians were ultimately successful, casualties among the infantry were heavy and during this time the regiment was involved in some hard fighting, with the Japanese able to make effective use of strong natural defences in conjunction with minefields and anti-tank ditches to compensate for their lack of anti-tank guns. With the fighting coming to a conclusion however, tank operations ceased on 24 July.|$|E
