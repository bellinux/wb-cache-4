5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was {{to reform the}} welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health care program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill {{in as little as}} 90 days. He insisted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E
5|$|During {{a congressional}} recess in July 1878, Hayes finally sacked Arthur and Cornell (Sharpe's term had expired) and {{appointed}} replacements. When Congress reconvened, Sherman pressured his former Senate colleagues {{to confirm the}} President's replacement nominees, which they did after considerable debate. Jay and other reformers criticized Sherman the next year when he traveled to New York to speak on Cornell's behalf in his campaign for governor of New York. Sherman replied {{that it was important}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>party</b> win the election there, despite their intra-party differences. His friendliness may also have related, as Arthur's biographer Thomas C. Reeves suggests, to a desire to keep Conkling's New York machine friendly to him as the 1880 presidential election approached.|$|E
25|$|In October 2009, it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> had approached Sullenberger about running against Democratic U.S. Representative Jerry McNerney of California's 11th congressional district in the 2010 elections. Sullenberger's publicist said that Sullenberger {{had no desire to}} run for any public office.|$|E
2500|$|The Wall Street Journal {{characterized}} the Obamacans as [...] "the latest sign <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party's</b> coalition is fracturing." ...|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} during this era, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party's</b> {{domination}} of <b>the</b> district was broken. Democrat John Abner Race, represented the district from 1965 to 1967. Other than this brief interruption, a Republican {{has been sent}} to Washington, D.C. in every election since 1938.|$|R
50|$|LGF {{has been}} ideologically opposed to Intelligent Design, and Johnson {{regularly}} posts {{to criticize the}} subject and those who endorse it. He is particularly critical of Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal on this point. In 2009, he stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party's</b> having visible advocates of Intelligent Design is one of <b>the</b> reasons <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Democrats were in power.|$|R
25|$|Black {{leaders in}} the North had insisted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> National {{platform}} for the presidential election of 1920 include support for anti-lynching legislation. After the election, the black community complained when months passed without Harding's getting a bill introduced and passed by Congress.|$|E
25|$|In December 1996, Coleman {{announced}} he was leaving the DFL party to join the Republican Party. He cited his frustrations with the Democratic Party and his belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> offered {{the best chance to}} continue his efforts to hold the line on taxes and grow jobs.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the earlier}} {{opposition}} from conservatives, in April 2008, {{there were signs}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> base was coalescing behind McCain's candidacy. A CBS News/New York Times poll showed that McCain was viewed favorably by 78 percent of conservatives, and unfavorably by only 18 percent. This was the same percentage who had an unfavorable opinion of George W. Bush {{at the same time}} in 2000.|$|E
50|$|The {{race for}} <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> {{primaries}} began slowly in 2011. Gallup polls found <b>that</b> historically <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> {{had a clear}} front-runner by March.|$|R
50|$|When {{beginning}} {{his tenure as}} party chairman, Schneider said <b>that</b> uniting <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> of Illinois, which had been divided geographically and ideologically, as a top goal.|$|R
50|$|Warren was {{chairman}} of the Des Moines County delegation to the convention of 1856 <b>that</b> organized <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> and nominated John C. Frémont as <b>the</b> first <b>Republican</b> presidential candidate.|$|R
25|$|Sullivan has {{declared}} support for Arnold Schwarzenegger and other like-minded Republicans. He argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> {{and much of}} the conservative movement in the United States, has largely abandoned its earlier scepticism and moderation in favour of a more fundamentalist certainty, both in religious and political terms. He has said this is the primary source of his alienation from the modern Republican Party.|$|E
25|$|It {{would be}} no exaggeration to say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> {{has been in a}} state of panic since the defeat of Mitt Romney, not least because the {{election}} highlighted American demographic shifts and, relatedly, the party's failure to appeal to Hispanics, Asians, single women and young voters. Hence the Republican leadership's new willingness to pursue immigration reform, even if it angers the conservative base.|$|E
25|$|Powell {{has been}} very vocal {{on the state of}} the Republican party. Speaking at a Washington Ideas forum in early October 2015, he warned the {{audience}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>party</b> had begun a move to the fringe right, lessening the chances of a Republican White House in the future. He also remarked on Republican presidential contender Donald Trump's statements regarding immigrants, noting that there were many immigrants working in Trump hotels.|$|E
5000|$|The United States Senate {{elections}} of 1866 and 1867 were elections <b>that</b> saw <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> gain two {{seats in the}} United States Senate as several of the Southern States were readmitted during Reconstruction, enlarging their majority.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1962, <b>the</b> Maryland <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> {{distributed}} sample ballots, marked [...] "official", that omitted Gleason's name. Gleason said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Maryland <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> violated its principles by openly preferring one Republican candidate over others. Gleason {{continued to}} campaign vigorously.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Fedele {{received}} the Prescott Bush Award, <b>the</b> highest honor <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Connecticut <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> awards {{to a member}} of the Party. Boy's Town of Italy also honored Fedele with their 2009 Humanitarian of the Year Award.|$|R
25|$|On November 8, 2011, Republicans {{took control}} of the State Senate with Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling as the tie {{breaking}} vote and increased their majority in the State House to a 68-seat vote margin, making it the Republican Party's largest House majority in history. It was the second time since the Reconstruction Era <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> simultaneously had a majority in the State House, a majority in the State Senate, and a sitting governor.|$|E
25|$|The 2012 Iowa Republican caucuses were {{originally}} {{scheduled to begin}} on February 6, 2012, much later than the date in 2008, which almost immediately followed {{the beginning of the}} year in January 2008. On September 29, 2011, the entire schedule of caucuses and primaries was disrupted, however, when it was announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> of Florida had decided to move up its primary to January 31, in an attempt to bring attention to its own primary contest, and attract the presidential candidates to visit the state.|$|E
25|$|Hall {{served in}} the Delaware Senate during the 1867/68 session and the 1869/70 session. In 1874 he was nearly {{nominated}} for Governor, but it was New Castle County’s turn in the informal rotation. Finally, in 1878 he was elected Governor of Delaware, overwhelmingly defeating Kensey J. Steward, the Greenback Labor candidate. Leftover bitterness from the Civil War caused the Democratic Party to be so completely in control <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> did not even hold a convention or field a candidate. Hall served from January 21, 1879 until January 16, 1883.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2016 Kagan {{publicly}} left <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>party</b> (referring {{to himself}} as a [...] "former Republican") and endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president and argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party's</b> [...] "wild obstructionism" [...] and an insistence that [...] "government, institutions, political traditions, party leadership and even parties themselves" [...] were things meant to be [...] "overthrown, evaded, ignored, insulted, laughed at" [...] {{set the stage for}} the rise of Donald Trump. Kagan called Trump a [...] "Frankenstein monster" [...] and also compared him to Napoleon. [...] In May 2016, Kagan wrote an opinion piece in the Washington Post regarding Trump's campaign entitled [...] "This Is How Fascism Comes to America". Kagan has said that [...] "all Republican foreign policy professionals are anti-Trump." ...|$|R
5000|$|After Joseph Smith's death, {{the church}} split. The largest {{contingent}} followed Brigham Young, who supported slavery but opposed abuse, and became The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). A smaller contingent followed Joseph Smith III, who opposed slavery, {{and became the}} Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS). Young led his followers to Utah, where he led the efforts to legalize slavery in the Utah Territory. [...] Brigham Young taught that slavery was ordained of God and taught <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party's</b> efforts to abolish slavery went against the decrees of God and would eventually fail. [...] He also encouraged members {{to participate in the}} Indian slave trade.|$|R
50|$|Neither the Democratic <b>Party</b> nor <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> held {{any other}} {{primaries}} on <b>that</b> day, with <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party's</b> own Virgin Islands caucus having taken place on March 10.|$|R
25|$|David Magleby, dean of Social and Behavioral Sciences at Brigham Young University, {{a lifelong}} Democrat and a {{political}} analyst, asserts <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> actually has more conservative positions than the LDS Church. Magleby argues that the locally conservative Democrats are in better accord with LDS doctrine. For example, the Republican Party of Utah opposes almost all abortions while Utah Democrats take a more liberal approach, although more conservative than their national counterparts. On Second Amendment issues, the state GOP has been {{at odds with the}} LDS Church position opposing concealed firearms in places of worship and in public spaces.|$|E
25|$|Allegations {{of voter}} list purges using {{unlawful}} criteria caused controversy {{in at least}} six swing states: Colorado, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Nevada and North Carolina. On October 5, 2008 the Republican Lt. Governor of Montana, John Bohlinger, accused the Montana Republican Party of vote caging to purge 6,000 voters from three counties which trend Democratic. Allegations arose in Michigan <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> planned to challenge the eligibility of voters based on lists of foreclosed homes. The campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama filed a lawsuit challenging this. The House Judiciary Committee wrote to the Department of Justice requesting an investigation.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, then-Apostle Ezra Taft Benson {{was quoted}} by the Associated Press {{that it would}} be {{difficult}} for a faithful Latter-day Saint to be a liberal Democrat. Although the LDS Church has officially repudiated such statements on many occasions, Democratic candidates—including LDS Democrats—believe that Republicans capitalize on the perception <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> is doctrinally superior. Political scientist and pollster Dan Jones explains this disparity by noting that the national Democratic Party is associated with liberal positions on gay marriage and abortion, both of which the LDS Church is against. The Republican Party in heavily Mormon Utah County presents itself as the superior choice for Latter-day Saints. Even though Utah Democratic candidates are predominantly LDS, socially conservative, and pro-life, no Democrat has won in Utah County since 1994.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Log Cabin <b>Republicans</b> (LCR) is an {{organization}} <b>that</b> works within <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> to advocate equal rights for LGBT people in the United States.|$|R
25|$|In 1998 {{the church}} {{expressed}} concern <b>that</b> Utahns perceived <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> as an LDS institution and authorized lifelong Democrat and Seventy Marlin Jensen to promote LDS bipartisanship.|$|R
50|$|Reed Smoot had a {{political}} {{alliance with the}} Mormons and Gentiles <b>that</b> helped <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> to gain power. The Democrats did not have as much power after 1900. Although, in 1924, Democratic legislator George Dern beat <b>the</b> incumbent <b>Republican</b> Governor Charles Mabey winning on the slogan, “We Want a Dern Good Governor and We Don’t Mean Mabey”.|$|R
25|$|Taylor {{appeared}} {{first in}} Tampa, Florida {{where he became}} a reporter, likely for the Florida Reporter. In 1911 he moved to St. Augustine, Florida where he was manager of the Magnolia Remedy Company which distributed curative salves and potions to tourists and others from the North who migrated to Florida {{during the winter months}} for health reasons. While in St. Augustine, he wrote two political tracts, “Removing the Mask” and “Backward Steps” which were popular themes from his earlier writing when he was claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> was hypocritical and was retreating from its promises. In 1912, Taylor was the editor of the Daily Promoter of Jacksonville and in 1917 became the editor of the “Black Star” edition of the Florida Times-Union, the state’s largest newspaper. He also was active in Jacksonville’s Young Men’s Christian Association, {{was a member of the}} Board of Commissioners for Jacksonville’s Masonic lodges, and maintained an office in Walker National Business College, one of the nation’s largest Black technical colleges.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} {{was held on}} November 2, 2004, with the initial count showing Gregoire trailing Rossi by 261 votes. However, a legally mandated machine recount reduced that lead to only 42 votes, then a hand count that was requested and funded by the state's Democratic Party gave Gregoire a 10-vote lead. Following a State Supreme Court ruling that allowed several hundred ballots from King County to be included, her lead was further increased to 130 votes, but when the vote was certified by the state's Secretary of State, Sam Reed, {{at the end of}} December, one vote which had been counted in Thurston County past the deadline was disqualified and her lead was reduced to 129 votes. Washington's Republican leadership then filed suit, claiming that hundreds of votes, including votes by felons, deceased voters, and double voters, were included in the canvass, but on June 6, 2005, Judge John E. Bridges ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>party</b> did not provide enough evidence that the disputed votes were ineligible—or for whom they were cast—to overturn the election.|$|E
500|$|... "Two Senate colleagues, John Sherman Cooper, R-Kentucky, and Herbert Lehman, D-New York, {{were among}} those who heaped praise on the Vermont senator. The editor of a {{national}} publication said: 'It {{was one of the}} few recent indications <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> on Capitol Hill is not wholly devoid of courageous moral leadership.' And an editorial in the Rutland Herald stated, 'The effect of the speech was to hearten that vast majority of Americans who hate communism but who also revere the Constitution.'" ...|$|E
