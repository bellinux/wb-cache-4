So, I thought, 'Yeah, it is,' and waited for a reply, but we never kind of got to it... It was no big bust-up. We kind of drifted apart after that".|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the year, Alpha Oumar Konaré, the {{chairman}} of the commission of the African Union and former president of Mali, reportedly urged Bozizé not to stand for election. Bozizé gave an interview to Radio France Internationale on May 17 in which he refused to say whether or not he would run, but he confirmed that Konaré had spoken <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> while criticizing Konaré for what he called interference in the country's affairs, and wondering whether he had consulted the opinions of the Central African people before getting involved. He stressed that the matter would depend on the will of the people. Some of his supporters campaigned prominently for him to stand. About 5,000 people walked in Bangui on June 19 to support his candidacy; Bozizé thanked them and asked for time to reflect.|$|E
25|$|Martínez Salinas, on {{the other}} hand, stated that {{he was forced to}} confess because he was a {{neighbor}} at Santa Elena and driver of the Hernández family. He said he had been beaten and taken to the ranch where he was told to pose with the exhumed bodies. When asked if he had ever met Constanzo, he stated that he had seen him in person at the ranch with the Hernándezes but never talked to him. Martínez Salinas said he was arrested one afternoon at Elio's in-law's house when {{he was looking for a}} car piece for his vehicle. He said he had known Aldrete years before, since he had dated one of her sisters when he was young. He said that he had never heard Aldrete talk about the cult. He said she had talked about her school and marriage. He also said that Elio and Ovidio never invited him to the cult or talked <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Coens have {{acknowledged}} several cinematic inspirations for Barton Fink. Chief {{among these are}} three movies by Polish-French filmmaker Roman Polanski: Repulsion (1965), Cul-de-Sac (1966), and The Tenant (1976). These movies employ a mood of psychological uncertainty coupled with eerie environments that compound the mental instability of the characters. Barton's isolation in his room at the Hotel Earle is frequently {{compared to that of}} Trelkovsky in his apartment in The Tenant. Ethan said regarding the genre of Barton Fink: [...] "t is kind of a Polanski movie. It is closer to that than anything else." [...] By coincidence, Polanski {{was the head of the}} jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 1991, where Barton Fink premiered. This created an awkward situation. [...] "Obviously", Joel Coen said later, [...] "we have been influenced by his films, but at this time we were very hesitant to speak <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> because we did not want to give the impression we were sucking up".|$|E
500|$|It was a {{journalist}} on a motorbike {{who managed to}} get up to me. He was shouting 'Not that way! Not that way!' And I turned round in the road and I rode back beneath the outside wall of the grandstand and I saw a gateway that went into the track, a gateway for journalists. And that's the way I went, except that it came out {{on the other side of}} the track from the proper entrance. The bunch came in and Serse won the sprint. But then his brother told Serse to go to the judges to object. He told Serse that I hadn't ridden the entire and precise course and that therefore I should be déclassé. But that was below him. Coppi wanted his brother to have a big victory. He was a great champion, Coppi, but to do what he did, to protest like that to get a victory for his brother, that wasn't dignified for a champion. That was below him. A champion like that should never have stooped that low. I never spoke <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Never did. Why should I? ...|$|E

What happened actually was then I started to ring him up. I thought, OK, here's the guy historically placed to give Lennon–McCartney a good deal at last. Cuz we got signed when we were 21 or something in a back alley in Liverpool. And the deal, it's remained the same, even though we made this company the most famous… hugely successful. So I kept thinking, {{it was time for a}} raise. Well you would, you know. [...] And so it was great. But I did talk <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> But he kind of blanked me on it. He kept saying, [...] "That's just business Paul." [...] You know. So, [...] "yeah it is", and waited for a reply. But we never kind of got to it. And I thought, mm.... So we kind of drifted apart.

2500|$|When Davout marched from Naumburg {{to glory}} at Auerstedt, Bernadotte refused {{to join his}} fellow marshal despite {{positive}} orders to do so. Instead, he executed an earlier set of orders to march to Dornburg and missed the fighting at both Jena and Auerstedt. Bernadotte found himself in serious trouble with his emperor. In a conversation with General of Division Jean Rapp Napoleon guessed that Bernadotte's behavior was caused by professional jealousy. The emperor remarked to General of Division Anne Jean Marie René Savary, [...] "This business is so hateful that if I send him before a court-martial {{it will be the}} equivalent of ordering him to be shot; it is better for me not to speak <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but I shall take care he shall know what I think of his behavior. I believe he has enough honor to recognize that he has performed a disgraceful action regarding which I shall not bandy words with him." [...] In the end, Bernadotte's career may have been saved because of Napoleon's fondness for his wife Désirée Clary, whom he almost married.|$|E
2500|$|On Saturday, April 27, a man {{was arrested}} in Corpus Christi, Texas for trying to sell a {{saxophone}} to a music store. On Thursday, April 25, the thirty-year-old man walked into a music store without an instrument and asked the sales person {{if they wanted to}} buy an alto Bundy saxophone. The girl told him that she would need to speak to her manager. The man replied, [...] "What do you have to talk <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> for? You work here, don't you?" [...] The girl claimed that the man seemed nervous. Once the manager was summoned, the man fled. The store contacted the police. The man was arrested two days later at a waterfront hotel after purchasing a [...]45 revolver from a pawn shop. On Tuesday, April 30, the sales girl identified him as the same man who tried selling the saxophone. Although no saxophone was found in his possession, the police found a bag of bloody clothing in his hotel room. The man claimed that the blood was from a cut he had received on his forehead in a bar fight.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{believed}} that Lynch was going to retire from the film industry; according to Abel Ferrara, Lynch [...] "doesn't even want to make films any more. I've talked <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> OK? I can tell {{when he talks about}} it." [...] However, in a June 2012 Los Angeles Times interview, Lynch stated that he lacked the inspiration to start a new movie project, but [...] "If I got an idea that I fell in love with, I'd go to work tomorrow". In September 2012, Lynch appeared in the three-part [...] "Late Show" [...] arc on FX's Louie as Jack Dahl. In November 2012, Lynch hinted at plans for a new film while attending Plus Camerimage in Bydgoszcz, Poland. Speaking at the festival, Lynch said [...] "something is coming up. It will happen but I don't know exactly when". At Plus Camerimage, Lynch was also presented with a lifetime achievement award and the key to the city by Bydgoszcz's mayor Rafał Bruski. During an interview with the Los Angeles Times in January 2013, frequent Lynch collaborator Laura Dern confirmed she and Lynch are planning a new project, and The New York Times later revealed Lynch is working on the script. Idem Paris, a short documentary film about the lithographic process, was released online in February 2013. On June 28, 2013, a music video directed by Lynch for the Nine Inch Nails song [...] "Came Back Haunted" [...] was released. He also did photography for the self-titled album from Dumb Numbers released August 2013.|$|E
