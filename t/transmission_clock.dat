40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{defines a}} frame forwarding technique offering a fixed delay to a subclass of traffic in closed industrial control networks. In these networks bandwidth {{is dedicated to}} periodic traffic supporting tight inter-process control and control loop communication. Ideally periodic traffic arrival will have minimal delay-jitter with constant realized delays. This simplifies the implementation of connected control devices. Furthermore networks are simplified with asynchronous node and switch operation. Switch designs are simplified {{as there is no}} dependence on adjacent switch clock operation. Correct network function only relies on switches directly traversed by each flow and is not dependent on complex clock synchronization mechanisms. Existing packet scheduling schemes that attempt to minimize delay-jitter, suffer from either requiring inter-switch clock coordination (i. e. RCSP-DJ), or maintain a fixed priority so that the highest priority flows must contend without regard to past frame arrival treatment (i. e. RCSP-RJ). In this dissertation the FlexTDMA protocol is defined which supports closed network communication. FlexTDMA will be enhanced to accommodate real-world networking conditions (FlexTDMA+) and will be enhanced to support simultaneous multicast (FlexTDMA++). The FlexTDMA scheduling algorithm delivers frame data on each flow nearly at the maximal delay bound with minimal delay-jitter in an asynchronous network. Industrial control switching network systems will benefit from FlexTDMA when the complexity of system level synchronization is unacceptable, but the component switches must operate independently. FlexTDMA does not require synchronous network clock coordination and preserves the data content of frames. FlexTDMA+ includes three improvements: baseline preemption, partial baselining and baseline deadline density control, which are used to support real-world conditions of node periodic on-off <b>transmission,</b> <b>clock</b> drift, frame loss and bandwidth load. FlexTDMA++ supports simultaneous multicast under real-world conditions of switch failures, node periodic on-off <b>transmission,</b> <b>clock</b> drift, frame loss and bandwidth load...|$|E

High-power, high repetition-rate picosecond and sub-picosecond pulse generation is now readily achievable with promising results for ultra-low jitter performance. © 2006 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: (140. 4050) Mode-locked lasers; (140. 5960) Semiconductor lasers Monolithic mode-locked laser diodes have for many years been regarded as potentially suitable for a large range of photonic applications due to their compactness, mechanical stability and robustness, high potential repetition rates and low potential jitter. As a result, monolithic mode-locking has been extensively studied in bulk and quantum well (QW) material systems for over 20 years. To date these laser sources {{have been shown to}} be suitable for several photonic applications, including high-speed data <b>transmission,</b> <b>clock</b> signal generation and electro-optic sampling.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a serializer/deserializer scheme for asynchronous address event representation (AER) bit-serial interchip communications. Each serial AER (sAER) link uses four wires: a micro strip pair for low voltage differential signaling (LVDS) and two handshaking lines. Each event {{is represented by}} a 32 -bit word. Two extra preamble bits are used for alignment. <b>Transmission</b> <b>clock</b> {{is embedded in the}} data using Manchester encoding. As opposed to conventional LVDS links, the presented approach allows to stop physical communication between data events, so that no “comma” characters need to be transmitted during these pauses. As soon as a new event needs to be transmitted, the link recovers immediately thanks to a built-in control voltage memorization circuit. As a result, power consumption of the serializer and deserializer circuits is proportional to data event rate. The approach is also highly tolerant to clock jitter, due to the asynchronous nature and the Manchester encoding. A chip test prototype has been fabricated in standard 0. 35 μm CMOS including a pair of Serializer and Deserializer circuits. Maximum measured event transmission rate is 15 Meps (mega events per second) for 32 -bit events, with a maximum bit transmission speed of 670 Mbps (mega bits per second). Peer reviewe...|$|E

It improves the efficiency, modularity and scalability of the system, and optimizes use of event triggers. For IoTH, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) - {{a subset of the}} recent Bluetooth v 4. 0 stack - provides a low-power and loosely coupled mechanism for sensor data collection with ubiquitous units (e. g., smartphones and tablets) carried by humans. This fundamental design paradigm of BLE is enabled by a range of broadcast advertising modes.

This paper presents and describes CheepSync: a time synchronization service for BLE advertisers, especially tailored for applications requiring high time precision on resource constrained BLE platforms.

To meet this requirement there are two fundamentally different paradigms: the event triggered approach and the time triggered approach (H. Kopetz, 1993). We consider the time triggered approach. The TTP initiates each of the processes on its arrival. This protocol integrates services such as predictable message <b>transmission,</b> <b>clock</b> synchronization, membership, mode change, and blackout handling.
