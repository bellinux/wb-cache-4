25|$|Yet {{one could}} claim {{in support of}} the PAD <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> there was a small 'anti-monarchy' {{movement}} which supported Thaksin. This disturbed many monarchists. Sondhi Limthongkul, forefront leader of PAD, had claimed this since 2005, when he started criticizing Thaksin Shinawatra for his 'inappropriate' act defaming the monarchy when Thaksin held a religious ceremony at the royal temple of Wat Phra Kaeo. From then on, PAD has accused Thaksin's followers as being 'anti-monarchy'. The UDD's and Thaksin's harsh attack on Prem Tinsulanonda, head of royal Privy Council and close advisor of the king, has been seen as a contradiction of Thai tradition and a hidden attempt to make a regime change. Moreover, a leader of UDD, such Jakrapob Penkair has engaged in public criticism {{of the role of the}} monarchy, mostly, seen 'negatively'. Several UDD leaders were also charged and arrested and accused of insulting the monarchy, a crime under Thai criminal law. The PAD, therefore, has always claimed that it was defending the most revered institution according to the Constitutions, blasting UDD and Thaksin Shinawatra as anti-monarchist. The controversial issue of the monarchy has been then one of the fierce causes among these factions' supporters.|$|E

500|$|After Sony {{canceled}} {{their shared}} universe plans and started sharing the Spider-Man character with Marvel Studios, multiple critics discussed their failure at replicating the MCU. Scott Meslow of The Week noted the perceived flaws {{of the first}} Amazing Spider-Man film, outside of its lead performances, and how the sequel [...] "doubles down on all the missteps of the original while adding a few of its own. …We now have a textbook example of how not to reboot a superhero franchise, and if Sony and Marvel are wise, they'll take virtually all those lessons to heart as they chart Spider-Man's next course." [...] Scott Mendelson noted that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 [...] "was sold as less a sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man than a backdoor pilot for Spider-Man vs. the Sinister Six. …Had Sony stuck with the original plan of a scaled-down superhero franchise, one <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> rooted in romantic drama, they would have at least stuck out in a crowded field of superhero franchises. When every superhero film is now going bigger, Amazing Spider-Man could have distinguished itself by going small and intimate." [...] This would have saved Sony [...] "a boatload of money", and potentially reversed the film's relative financial failure.|$|E

500|$|Sean Connery was {{the first}} actor to portray Bond on film in Dr. No (1962). An amateur bodybuilder, {{he had come to}} the {{attention}} of the Bond film producers after several appearances in British films from the late 1950s. At a muscular 6'2", Fleming originally disapproved of his casting as James Bond, believing him to be an overgrown stuntman who lacked the finesse and elegance to play James Bond; he envisaged a suave actor, such as David Niven playing the role. Producer Albert R. Broccoli—known to all as Cubby—disagreed with Fleming's view, later commenting that [...] "I wanted a ballsy guy... put a bit of veneer over that tough Scottish hide and you've got Fleming's Bond instead of all the mincing poofs we had applying for the job". Eon's choice of Connery was also based on his looks and sex appeal, an appeal that would later be echoed by Honor Blackman who said, after appearing with Connery in Goldfinger, [...] "He was exceedingly handsome, virile and sexy and <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> the tenor of what the script was always trying to display". After Connery was chosen, director Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser, and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London. In the words of Bond writer Raymond Benson, Young educated the actor [...] "in the ways of being dapper, witty, and above all, cool".|$|E
2500|$|Lancashire is the {{daughter}} of Geoffrey Lancashire, a scriptwriter who worked on 171episodes of Coronation Street during the 1960s. She made her first Coronation Street appearance in 1987, shortly after graduating from drama school. Lancashire had a walk-on role as Wendy Farmer, a nurse who enquired about lodging with established character Jack Duckworth (William Tarmey). the actress then spent a year performing in West End theatre, and worked as a drama lecturer in Salford before being cast as Raquel in 1991, initially on a three-month contract. She continued to teach for a year, before committing to Coronation Street full-time. Thompson believes that it was Raquel's role in the 1994 Tanya and Des love triangle storyline which [...] "elevated [...] to the pantheon of Street legend." [...] Lancashire recalls it as a well-constructed storyline with credible pacing, explaining that [...] "because Raquel lives in this very idealistic world – she's such a dreamer – when reality hits her, it hits very, very hard. <b>That</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> the first opportunity we'd had to strip away a bit of the exterior of her character and see how fragile she was." ...|$|E

[...] Benji Wilson of The Daily Telegraph rated the episode three and a half stars out of five, stating [...] "there was so little solid ground to stand on that things started getting a little Electric Kool-Aid," [...] though [...] "normality returned with the death of Ruth." [...] Wilson also praised Walker's performance. Tom Sutcliff of The Independent stated [...] "Spooks has often relished the pleasure of a good explosion in the past, but it declined to go out on one."

[...] Television gave Zemeckis his first glimpse of a world outside of his blue-collar upbringing; specifically, he learned of the existence of film schools on an episode of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. After seeing Bonnie and Clyde with his father and being heavily influenced by it, Zemeckis decided that {{he wanted to go to}} film school. His parents disapproved of the idea, Zemeckis later said, [...] "But only in the sense that they were concerned... for my [...] family and my friends and the world that I grew up in, this was the kind of dream <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> impossible.

That generated the crash and then this chaotic domino effect <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> a day to forget." [...] Félix da Costa blamed di Grassi for causing the collision, claiming the latter was [...] "out of character" [...] and did not believe that he would attempt such a manoeuvre. He added while di Grassi was intelligent, he steered earlier than expected which forced him to be squeezed into the wall: [...] "He was being very clever - I overtook him and he was staying there. But one lap to another his mind just switched, he tried to overtake me like 20 times in five corners. He was all over me, and then he was just trying desperate moves everywhere." [...] Di Grassi lamented the ePrix and said his team would forget about the event because of him going from being the fastest driver in the second practice session to having a poor qualifying lap and would recover for the next race of the season.|$|E
