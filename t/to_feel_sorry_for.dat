5|$|A large robotic craft arrives {{searching for}} Finn. When Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) finally {{encounters}} it, Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) destroys {{it with his}} fist. Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) examines the wreckage and discovers its location of origin; this engenders in Finn a desire to discover the craft's creators. Finn thus resolves to travel across the sea from whence the craft came, but before leaving, he tells Fern (voiced by Hayden Ezzy) to stay and look after Ooo for him. Princess Bubblegum, Marceline (voiced by Olivia Olson) and Fern see Finn, Jake and Susan Strong (voiced by Jackie Buscarino) off on their voyage. Initially, the journey is easy and uneventful, but soon, Finn, Jake, and Susan encounter a sea dragon named Whipple (voiced by Josh Fadem), who {{turns out to be}} rather annoying. BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), who unbeknownst to the others was stowing away on their boat, angrily tells Whipple off, which causes the sea dragon to summon a storm and destroys their boat. This predicament forces Jake to use his magical powers and take on the shape of a boat for the rest to ride. Unfortunately, {{below the surface of the}} water, a species of jellyfish latches onto him, which causes Jake to begin hallucinating. Eventually, after much struggle, Finn and Susan are able to remove them, which causes the hallucinations to end. At this point, Jake complains about wanting to return home, but Finn reveals how important this trip is to him. Whipple overhears Finn's lament and begins <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> his actions; he then uses his powers to blow the group over the dangerous waters.|$|E

Liz finds it strange that Jack's fiancée Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) will not spend the holiday with him and {{immediately}} realizes that Jack has not told his mother about Avery's pregnancy. Avery becomes angry, but she and Liz convince him to tell her which he promises to do. Jack tells Colleen about the news {{but she is not}} excited about the pregnancy as Jack and Avery are not married. To get back at her, Jack calls his biological father Milton Greene (Alan Alda), the father she never told him he had, and invites him to spend Christmas with him, and does not inform him that Colleen will be present. The next day, Milton arrives and Jack explains the reason for his visit is so that he can ambush Colleen as she looks down on his relationship with Avery. Later, Avery arrives and is angered about what Colleen said about her relationship with Jack. Liz tries to warn Colleen about Jack's plan but to no avail. She is shocked to see Milton, but immediately figures out what Jack is up to. Colleen gets even with Jack by faking a heart attack, which causes Milton and Avery <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> her thus abandoning their plan to reprimand Colleen. At the hospital, Avery reveals that she and Jack had planned to elope over New Year's and extends an invitation to everyone.

"The Open Boat" [...] {{directly}} references Lady Caroline Norton's 1883 poem [...] "Bingen on the Rhine", {{which focuses}} {{on the death of}} a French Foreign Legionnaire, far from home, while grasping the hand of a comrade. Recalling the poem, the correspondent sees how the soldier's dire circumstances mirror his own, leading him <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> the anonymous poetic figure; noting the similarities between the dying soldier and the shipwrecked correspondent, critics such as Edward Stone and Max Westbrook believe this realization causes the correspondent to discover the necessity for human sympathy in an uncaring world. While the literary reference may be considered ironic, unsympathetic, and only of minor interest, Stone for one argued that this poem may also have served as a source for The Red Badge of Courage, which also explores man's relationship with the metaphysical.|$|E

2500|$|Seinfeld broke several {{conventions}} of mainstream television. The show offers no growth or reconciliation to its characters. It eschews sentimentality. An episode is typically driven by humor interspersed with the superficial conflicts of characters with peculiar dispositions. Many episodes {{revolve around the}} characters' involvement {{in the lives of}} others with typically disastrous results. On the set, the notion that the characters should not develop or improve throughout the series was expressed as the [...] "no hugging, no learning" [...] rule. Also unlike most sitcoms, there are no moments of pathos; the audience is never made <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> any of the characters.

The silence doesn't tell us anything, it just asks us <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> him... All is not lost, though, because as we gaze at Chiron, {{we can think of}} something else: his resemblance to Juan (his father figure). Does it mean that Juan was once a Chiron... Not quite that perhaps, but the last shot of the film is of the young Chiron sitting on the beach... looking out at the ocean... His wide eyes suggest all the desolation and promise that Juan saw in him at the beginning. If we started again, would things be different?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} the {{relationship}} between characters in Beowulf to God, one might recall the substantial amount of paganism that is present throughout the work. Literary critics such as Fred C. Robinson argue that the Beowulf poet arguably tries {{to send a message to}} readers during the Anglo-Saxon time period regarding the state of Christianity in their own time. Robinson argues that the intensified religious aspects of the Anglo-Saxon period inherently shape the way in which the Poet alludes to paganism as presented in Beowulf. The Poet arguably calls on Anglo-Saxon readers to recognize the imperfect aspects of their supposed Christian lifestyles. In other words, the Poet is referencing their [...] "Anglo-Saxon Heathenism." [...] In {{terms of the}} characters of the epic itself, Robinson argues that readers are [...] "impressed" [...] by the courageous acts of Beowulf and the speeches of Hrothgar (181). But, one is ultimately left <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> both men as they are fully detached from supposed [...] "Christian truth" [...] (181).

2500|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home to play the Reds, dropping the opener 6-4 when Dee Gordon committed a costly error {{in the seventh inning}} with the game tied, leading to four runs scoring. The Dodgers wasted a fine start by Kershaw on June 15 as the Scott Elbert allowed a go-ahead eighth-inning single to Joey Votto and the Reds won 3-2. Scott Rolen got three hits and drove in three runs as the Reds finished off their sweep of the Dodgers 7-2. The slumping Dodgers were subsequently handled by Houston starter Brett Myers, who retired 17 consecutive batters at one point and made only 98 pitches in a 7-3 Astros win. The Dodgers home losing streak hit five when they were shut out by the Astros 7-0 on June 18. The game was doubly frustrating because starting catcher Rod Barajas suffered an ankle strain in the second inning and joined the multitude of Dodgers already on the disabled list. Manager Don Mattingly said after the game, [...] "We're frustrated, that's for sure, but you know what? We don't have time to be frustrated... This is not the time <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> ourselves." [...] The Dodgers avoided being swept by the last place Astros with a 1-0 victory on June 19, that ended the five-game losing streak. A solo homer by Dioner Navarro {{in the bottom of the}} 8th inning was all the Dodgers offense could muster, but it was enough as Hiroki Kuroda and two relievers pitched a shutout. In the next game, Clayton Kershaw was dominant, striking out 11 in a two-hit shutout of the Detroit Tigers. He also hit a two-run eighth-inning single to extended the Dodgers lead in the 4-0 win. Chad Billingsley's turn was next and he also pitched effectively, allowing just one run in 5 1/3 innings as the Dodgers won their third straight, 6-1, over the Tigers. Matt Kemp reached base all five times he came up to bat in the series finale, with three hits (including a triple) and two walks but the Dodgers were done in by four home runs hit by the Tigers off of Ted Lilly in the 7-5 loss. The Los Angeles Angels came to town next for the next installment of the Freeway Series. In the opener, the Angels won a sloppy game with baserunning and fielding errors 8-3. [...] "I don't like the way it's going, thats for sure." [...] Manager Don Mattingly said after the Dodgers lost 6-1 in game 2. The Dodgers bounced back to take the series finale 3-2. Clayton Kershaw struck out eleven in the game and pitched his second straight complete game, the first Dodger to do so in 11 years. Tony Gwynn, Jr.'s RBI single in the bottom of the ninth won it for the Dodgers.|$|E

Inside Soap critic Sam expressed disinterest in a storyline in which Tony and Ruth kiss, questioning if they have [...] "gone back in time or something?"
