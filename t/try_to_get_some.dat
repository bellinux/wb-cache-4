5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) offers free family {{portraits in}} the office, and {{many members of}} the office take {{advantage}} of the opportunity, including Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) with his very elderly parents, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) with his teenaged daughter Sasha, Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) with her teenaged son, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) with Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), a desperate Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) trying to win back Kelly's affection yet again, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) with a reluctant Jim (John Krasinski) and their children Cecelia and Philip. Senator Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) later comes by with his and Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) son Philip to also get a family portrait. Jim suspects that Dwight's motive for giving away family portraits was to get revenge on Jim for a prank involving a fake Velcro suit, but Dwight's real motive was to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> of Philip Lipton's DNA to run a test to determine who Philip's actual father is. Angela is very much against this idea and tries to ensure that Dwight does not get the opportunity. After taking the pictures, Robert notices that Philip's diaper is full, so he goes to change him. After doing so Dwight goes into the bathroom to retrieve the diaper, but Angela chases after him as he makes a break for the hospital to run the DNA test. Dwight and Angela then take part in a high-speed car chase until Dwight calls his cousin Mose (Michael Schur) to take her off his trail with a duplicate Trans Am. Angela later finds him in the hospital waiting area, where he confirms {{he is going to be}} there for the entire 72-hour waiting period for the DNA results. After she sits down, holding his hand, Dwight begins kissing her and Angela briefly demurs before passionately kissing him in return.|$|E

With money from pawning his boots, a bare-footed Kelly took a bed at the lodging-house just after 8:00p.m., and according to the deputy keeper remained there all night.|$|E
2500|$|However, not all {{reviews of}} the album were positive: Record Mirror in the UK awarded the album two stars out of five, deriding it as [...] "The same nothingy vocals, the same jangly guitar, the same plodding beat on almost every track.

I lived through it as a Marine and I know that those sorts of approaches, while they seem {{attractive}} on one level are really not that realistic. What {{we want to do}} – and I was talking with a number of senators today – is to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> of these so-called emergency legislation packages back into the committee process so that the committees can actually play." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1976 phone {{conversation}} with John Maher, Jones alternately {{stated that he}} was an agnostic and an atheist. Despite the Temple's fear that the IRS was investigating its religious tax exemption, Marceline Jones admitted in a 1977 New York Times interview that Jones was trying to promote Marxism in the U.S. by mobilizing people through religion, citing Mao Zedong as his inspiration. She stated that, [...] "Jim used religion to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> people out of the opiate of religion", and had slammed the Bible on the table yelling [...] "I've got to destroy this paper idol!" [...] In one sermon, Jones said that, [...] "You're gonna help yourself, or you'll get no help! There's only one hope of glory; that's within you! Nobody's gonna come out of the sky! There's no heaven up there! We'll have to make heaven down here!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The move to San Francisco {{permitted}} Jones {{to return}} to urban recruitment and made better political sense because it permitted the Temple to show its true political stripes. By spring 1976, Jones openly admitted even to outsiders {{that he was an}} atheist. Despite the Temple's fear that the IRS was investigating its religious tax exemption, by 1977, Jones' wife, Marcy, openly admitted to the New York Times that Jones had not been lured to religion because of faith, but because it served his goal of social change through Marxism. She stated that, as early as age 18 when he watched his idol Mao Zedong defeat the Nationalists in the Chinese Civil War, Jones realized that the way to achieve social change in the United States was to mobilize people through religion. She admitted that [...] "Jim used religion to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> people out of the opiate of religion" [...] and had slammed the Bible on the table yelling, [...] "I've got to destroy this paper idol!" ...|$|E
