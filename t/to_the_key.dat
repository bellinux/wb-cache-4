5|$|In {{contrast}} to the intense single character focus of his first novel, ¡Ecue-Yamba-O! (Praised Be the Lord!), Carpentier offers a diversified understanding of black society and its beliefs in The Kingdom of This World. There exists remarkable respect for accuracy on all sides including historical facts, character names, place names, and even street names. This adds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> blend of marvellous fantasy and historical accuracy.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} territory, {{which consisted}} of Serbia proper, {{the northern part of}} Kosovo (around Kosovska Mitrovica), and the Banat was occupied by the Germans and placed under the administration of a German military government. This was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> rail and riverine transport routes that passed through it, and its valuable resources, particularly non-ferrous metals.|$|E

5|$|Fluorite mining, which {{supplies}} most global fluorine, {{peaked in}} 1989 when 5.6 {{million metric tons}} of ore were extracted. Chlorofluorocarbon restrictions lowered this to 3.6 million tons in 1994; production has since been increasing. Around 4.5 million tons of ore and revenue of US$550 million were generated in 2003; later reports estimated 2011 global fluorochemical sales at $15 billion and predicted 2016–18 production figures of 3.5 to 5.9 million tons, and revenue of at least $20 billion. Froth flotation separates mined fluorite into two main metallurgical grades of equal proportion: 60–85% pure metspar is almost all used in iron smelting whereas 97%+ pure acidspar is mainly converted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> industrial intermediate hydrogen fluoride.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded {{and quickly}} {{defeated}} by the Axis powers. Yugoslavia was partitioned, {{and as part of}} this, the Germans established a military government of occupation in an area roughly the same as the pre-1912 Kingdom of Serbia, consisting of Serbia proper, the northern part of Kosovo (around Kosovska Mitrovica), and the Banat. This was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> rail and riverine transport routes that passed through it, and its valuable resources, particularly non-ferrous metals. They did this to secure two strategic lines of communication – the Danube river, and the railway line that connected Belgrade with Salonika in occupied Greece, and thence by sea to North Africa. The German occupied territory of Serbia was also rich in non-ferrous metals such as lead, antimony and copper, which German needed to support its war effort.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> task {{of direct}} support to troops at Kosong 7 June. On her first mission, she completely destroyed two gun positions, an observation post, and their supporting trenches, then stood by on call for further aid. She then sailed back to Wonsan for a day-long bombardment 24 June, aimed at guns placed in caves. The results were excellent, with eight direct hits on three caves, one cave demolished, and four others closed. Next day {{she returned to}} troop support at Kosong, her assignment until 10 July, aside from necessary withdrawal for replenishment.|$|E

5|$|Relations between Nasser and Qasim grew {{increasingly}} bitter on 9 March, after Qasim's forces suppressed a rebellion in Mosul, launched {{a day earlier}} by a pro-Nasser Iraqi RCC officer backed by UAR authorities. Nasser had considered dispatching troops to aid his Iraqi sympathizers, but decided against it. He clamped down on Egyptian communist activity due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> backing Iraqi communists provided Qasim. Several influential communists were arrested, including Nasser's old comrade Khaled Mohieddin, who {{had been allowed to}} re-enter Egypt in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes, {{a single}} rank of pipes {{may be able}} to be {{controlled}} by several stops, allowing the rank to be played at multiple pitches or on multiple manuals. Such a rank is said to be unified or borrowed. For example, an 8 Diapason rank may also be made available as a 4 Octave. When both of these stops are selected and a key (for example, c) is pressed, two pipes of the same rank will sound: the pipe normally corresponding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> played (c), and the pipe one octave above that (c). Because the 8 rank does not have enough pipes to sound the top octave of the keyboard at 4 pitch, it is common for an extra octave of pipes used only for the borrowed 4 stop to be added. In this case, the full rank of pipes (now an extended rank) is one octave longer than the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|Australian Army {{units were}} {{deployed}} as occupation forces following the Japanese surrender. Under {{the terms of}} an agreement reached between Blamey and Admiral Louis Mountbatten, the head of South East Asia Command, Australia was responsible for providing occupation forces for all of Borneo, the NEI east of Lombok (including western New Guinea) and the pre-war Australian and British territories in eastern New Guinea and the Solomon Islands as well as Nauru and Ocean Islands in the Pacific. The Australian forces in Borneo and the NEI were to remain in place only until they were relieved by British and Dutch units in late 1945. I Corps was responsible for garrisoning Borneo and the eastern NEI, and the First Army disarmed Japanese forces in the pre-war British and Australian territories in and around New Guinea. After the surrender documents were signed the 7th and 9th Divisions took control of Borneo and five forces were dispatched from Morotai and Darwin <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> islands in the eastern NEI. While the British forces in the western NEI took part in fighting against Indonesian nationalists, the Australians were careful to not {{become involved in the}} Indonesian National Revolution and sought to hand control of their occupation zones to the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration as quickly as possible. Relations between the Australian troops and Indonesians were generally good, {{due in part to the}} decision by the Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia to not load Dutch ships which were carrying military supplies bound for the NEI. The last Australian occupation troops left the NEI in February 1946.|$|E

5|$|In November 1940, {{with the}} support of the leader of the Volksgruppe in Rumänien (ethnic Germans in Romania), Andreas Schmidt, Phleps had written <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> Waffen-SS {{recruiting}} officer SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen SS (Brigadier) Gottlob Berger offering his services to the Third Reich. Phleps subsequently asked for permission to leave Romania to join the Wehrmacht, and this was approved by the recently installed Romanian Conducător (dictator) General Ion Antonescu. Phleps volunteered for the Waffen-SS instead, enlisting under his mother's maiden name of Stolz. According to the historian Hans Bergel, Phleps joined the Waffen-SS because Volksdeutsche were not permitted to join the Wehrmacht. He was appointed as a SS-Standartenführer (colonel) by Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler and joined the SS Motorised Division Wiking, where he commanded Dutch, Flemish, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish volunteers. When Hilmar Wäckerle, the commander of SS-Regiment Westland, was killed in action near Lvov in late June 1941, Phleps took over command of that regiment. Phleps distinguished himself in the fighting at Kremenchuk and Dnipropetrovsk in the Ukraine, commanded his own Kampfgruppe, became a confidant of Generalmajor (Brigadier General) Hans-Valentin Hube, commander of the 16th Panzer Division, and was subsequently promoted to SS-Oberführer (senior colonel). In July 1941 he was awarded the 1939 clasp to his Iron Cross (1914) 2nd Class and then the Iron Cross (1939) 1st Class.|$|E
