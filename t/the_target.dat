5|$|The {{concept was}} for the {{satellite}} to be launched ahead of its target, so that <b>the</b> <b>target</b> would come close to it. After this the Agena would be used as fuel to put the SAINT in a co-orbit with its target, and then the SAINT would locate <b>the</b> <b>target</b> using its long range radar, and jettison its Agena once it had acquired <b>the</b> <b>target.</b> Then within the next 8 to 12 minutes the SAINT's radar and orientation systems would guide it to within 39ft (12m) of <b>the</b> <b>target.</b> If a SAINT was launched from Cape Canaveral, it {{would be able to}} provide initial video of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> and data dumps to the NORAD station in Rhodesia. A full inspection of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> would take two hours, and be recorded, then sent to a ground station as soon as it came within the range of the station.

After this it would be depleted of battery power and propellant.|$|E

50|$|There are {{multiple}} theories surrounding the neural correlates of masking, {{but most of}} them agree on a few key ideas.

Forward masking, on the other hand, is correlated to the suppression of <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> “onset-response”, which can be thought of as the neural response to <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> appearance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In the {{existing}} process of maneuvering <b>target</b> tracking, <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> actual trajectory {{can not be}} foreseen precisely. A commonly attempt is {{under the assumption that}} <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> trajectory is prefixed. The prefixed model is usually not inosculated with <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> actual trajectory, and <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> tracking precision can not be guaranteed. In this paper a parameter identification model is presented. This model identifies <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> trajectory dynamically, adapts to the variation of working cycle, and covers kinds of possible state of <b>the</b> maneuvering <b>target.</b> An adaptive filtering is then employed to analyze the tracking. We call it as a whole adaptive tracking in this paper. Simulations verify that this adaptive tracking algorithm effectively improves the tracking precision...|$|R

Simulations show that motion camouflage {{results in a}} more efficient pursuit path than classical pursuit (i.e. the motion camouflage path is shorter), whether <b>the</b> <b>target</b> flies {{in a straight line}} or chooses a chaotic path. Further, where classical pursuit requires the attacker to fly faster than <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> the motion camouflaged attacker can sometimes capture <b>the</b> <b>target</b> despite flying more slowly than it.|$|E

40|$|Is {{the effect}} of {{distractors}} in multiple object tracking dependent on the distractors sharing the features of <b>the</b> <b>targets?</b> In experiment 1, observers tracked five targets among five distractors that were identical to <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> {{and a number of}} additional distractors that were either identical to or featurally distinct from <b>the</b> <b>targets.</b> Results showed that distractors that are distinct from <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> in shape or color, or are stationary, impair tracking less than distractors that are identical to <b>the</b> <b>targets.</b> However, tracking performance declined as the number of distractors increased, even for featurally distinct distractors. Experiment 2 showed that distractors that differ from <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> on two features impair tracking less than distractors that differ from <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> on only one feature, but only when target tracking load is low. These results indicate that shape, color, and motion information about distractors can be used to distinguish them from targets during tracking, although even distractors with a different feature from <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> produce some interference with tracking. These findings suggest that {{the effect of}} distractors on tracking is dependent on top – down settings for target features...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{aiming at}} the problem of UAV path {{planning}} for multiple moving <b>targets,</b> after <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> are determined, radar is used to observe <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> and obtain their observation positions.

5|$|Currently, {{the beam}} intensities at superheavy element {{facilities}} result in about 1012 projectiles hitting <b>the</b> <b>target</b> per second; this cannot be increased without burning <b>the</b> <b>target</b> and the detector, and producing larger {{amounts of the}} increasingly unstable actinides needed for <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is impractical. The team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna is building a new superheavy element factory (SHE-factory) with improved detectors {{and the ability to}} work on a smaller scale, but even so continuing beyond element 120 and perhaps 121 would be a great challenge. Krzysztof Rykaczewski, a professor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory which collaborates with Dubna on superheavy elements, has nevertheless predicted that in one generation element 124 would be reached. Chemist, writer, and philosopher of science Eric Scerri has noted that the development of new technologies in the field has been driven by the quest for new elements, so that the inability to proceed beyond elements 120 and 121 with current technologies may not necessarily cause a very long pause in new discoveries.|$|E
