5|$|Force India driver Nico Hülkenberg {{served a}} three-place grid penalty {{following}} qualifying after being deemed at-fault for {{a collision with}} Williams driver Felipe Massa at the previous event in Singapore. Red Bull equipped both of their cars with new <b>turning</b> <b>vanes</b> for the Grand Prix {{in order to improve}} the airflow underneath the car and therefore create more downforce. The new device had previously only been used by Daniil Kvyat during the previous race in Singapore. After a poor performance in Singapore, Mercedes introduced a revised rear wing endplate, while McLaren brought a new front wing to Suzuka.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine upgrades Honda introduced for the , McLaren brought a new aerodynamic package for the MP4-30 which revised the front wing to increase downforce, altered the <b>turning</b> <b>vanes</b> to improve air flow over the front splitter, and adopted a concept pioneered by Ferrari to the rear floor designed to reduce the impact of airflow washing over the rear wheels and disrupting the rear diffuser, which in turn opened up {{a wider range of}} set-up options for the ride height and rake, or the angle between the front and rear ride height. These updates were designed to bring the MP4-30 in line with the designs developed by other teams. With the engine and aerodynamic updates, the team had hoped to compete for points on merit, and while Alonso clashed with Felipe Massa on the opening lap, he was running as high as fifth on the closing stages—and was on course to replicate the team's best result of the season—before suffering a loss of power and slipping back down the order to finish eleventh. With Alonso out of the points, Button was promoted to sixth. The race also saw what would be the car's best qualifying performance as Alonso started eleventh, while the six points Button scored saw the team close to within ten points of Sauber in the World Constructors' Championship. However, the result also meant that McLaren had endured its longest winless streak of fifty-three races, previously set between the 1977 Japanese Grand Prix and the 1981 British Grand Prix. Despite the progress that the team made over the previous rounds, the MP4-30's struggles continued in Mexico, with both drivers eliminated early in qualifying, and Jenson Button setting a new record for grid penalties, changing enough parts to warrant a seventy-place penalty. Alonso retired from the race with an incurable ERS problem that the team had identified the night before and Button finished fourteenth overall.|$|E
25|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{regulations were}} radically altered for the 2009 season. The front wings were made lower and wider, while rear wings were changed {{to be higher}} and narrower. As well as {{the changes in the}} dimensions of the wings, bodywork became much more regulated with many of the additional components seen in previous seasons (including barge boards, winglets and <b>turning</b> <b>vanes)</b> removed, making 2009 cars noticeably different in appearance than in previous years. The diffuser {{at the rear of the}} car was moved back and upwards. Many other minor chassis components were also standardised. The aim of the new aerodynamic regulations, as well as the reintroduction of slick tyres, was to decrease reliance on aerodynamic downforce and increase mechanical grip with the aim of making wheel-to-wheel racing easier.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2009 A one-sixth scaled {{facility}} was constructed at Oregon State University {{to determine the}} pressure losses around Westinghouse's AP 1000 Passive Containment Cooling System. An explanation of the AP 1000 Passive Containment Cooling System is given. This study examined the pressure loss and loss coefficient around the 180 degree turn of the Passive Containment Cooling System. Computational Fluid Dynamics Models were developed for multiple <b>turning</b> <b>vane</b> designs. Comparisons were made between the FLUENT models and the experimental facility. A <b>turning</b> <b>vane</b> reduced the pressure loss by at least a factor of four compared to a straight geometry. The pressure loss around the 180 degree turn was insignificant compared to the pressure loss encountered in other locations in the Passive Containment Cooling System. The Computational Fluid Dynamics code accurately predicted the ow behavior around the 180 degree turn. All of the ow tests were performed under turbulent conditions...|$|R

25|$|Small sidepod {{winglets}} {{were significantly}} altered {{prior to the}} 2008 French Grand Prix, providing twin <b>turning</b> <b>vanes</b> to better control airflow over {{the rear of the}} car. At the Canadian Grand Prix tweaks were also made to the flip-up flaps in front of the rear wheels, to reduce drag. For the Italian Grand Prix, at the low-downforce Monza circuit, Williams tweaked the design of the FW30's bodywork, and front and rear wings. Sporting only a single element, with its outer edges turned upward, the rear wing was designed to reduce drag on Monza's long, fast straights, while still providing sufficient downforce during cornering. Final adjustments were made to the FW30's rear aerodynamics prior to the Brazilian Grand Prix. Here, the small winglets in front of the rear wheels were augmented by the addition of a small flap beneath their main elements, in order to better deflect airflow around the wheels and reduce the aerodynamic disruption caused by the wheels' rotation.|$|E
500|$|Hamilton {{had won the}} {{preceding}} British Grand Prix by 68seconds from Heidfeld and Honda's Rubens Barrichello. Of his championship rivals, Räikkönen had finished fourth, Kubica had retired, and Massa had had a nightmare of a race, spinning five times and finishing 13th. In {{the run-up to the}} German Grand Prix, Hamilton had tested the McLaren MP4-23's new front wing [...] introduced at the British Grand Prix [...] extensively in the team's simulator, and then during a pre-race test session at the Hockenheim circuit. Having honed the car's setup to his liking after initially finding the handling difficult, he used it in the race. Kovalainen was not as comfortable with the car's handling and ran a greater front wing angle to produce more downforce, at the expense of having to run larger radiators due to the reduced airflow produced over the car. This led to a slight reduction in his car's overall performance. [...] In other technical developments, Ferrari introduced revised bargeboards, exhaust exits and an altered windscreen for its F2008 car. BMW Sauber added <b>turning</b> <b>vanes</b> to the top of its F1.08's nose, while Toyota removed some bodywork from its TF108's exhaust exits. Honda also introduced new bargeboards for its RA108 chassis. [...] All of these changes were carried out with the aim of improving each car's aerodynamic performance.|$|E
500|$|Coming to Singapore, Nico Rosberg {{was forced}} to change his power unit after his engine failure at the {{previous}} race in Italy. Using his fourth unit of the season, Rosberg was one power unit change away from a possible grid penalty. Alexander Rossi made his Formula One debut after signing a five-race deal to replace Roberto Merhi at Manor Marussia. Acting as race stewards at the Grand Prix were Garry Connelly from Australia and Vincenzo Spano from Venezuela, who assisted driver steward Martin Donnelly in his first appearance in this position since the 2014 Malaysian Grand Prix. Sauber brought a [...] "heavily-updated car" [...] to the Grand Prix, featuring a shorter nose and revised front and rear wings {{as well as a}} new engine cover and brake ducts. Toro Rosso also came to Singapore with new parts, bringing a revised front wing. Red Bull introduced a new component as well: Daniil Kvyat's car was equipped with new <b>turning</b> <b>vanes</b> installed to improve the airflow under the car and therefore create more downforce. The feature would be run by both cars at the following Japanese Grand Prix. Further updates included changes to the diffuser, rear wing, brake ducts and bodywork of the Force India VJM08B and modifications to {{the floor in front of}} the rear wheels of the Ferrari SF15-T.|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} method {{has been developed}} to estimate the unsteady aerodynamic forces caused by flow field turbulence on a wind tunnel <b>turning</b> <b>vane</b> cascade system (vane set). This method approximates dynamic lift and drag by linearly perturbing the appropriate steady state force equations, assuming that the dynamic loads are due only to free stream turbulence and that this turbulence is homogeneous, isotropic, and Gaussian. Correlation and unsteady aerodynamic effects are also incorporated into the analytical model. Using these assumptions, equations relating dynamic lift and drag to flow turbulence, mean velocity, and vane set geometry are derived. From these equations, estimates for the power spectra and rms (root mean squared value, delta) loading of both lift and drag can be determined...|$|R
