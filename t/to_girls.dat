25|$|Other recent policy {{initiatives}} adopted by many states of India, claims Guilmoto, attempt {{to address the}} assumed economic disadvantage of girls by offering support <b>to</b> <b>girls</b> and their parents.

Some states are offering higher pension benefits to parents who raise one or two girls.

For example, the state of Delhi adopted a pro-girl policy initiative (locally called Laadli scheme), which initial data suggests may be lowering the birth sex ratio in the state.|$|E
