Some said that he was not ill at all, but that in the present state of affairs the {{retirement}} suited him. But the nature of the operation which he had undergone was known to many who would not have him harassed in his present condition. In truth, he had only <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>admission</b> to all visitors and to take care that his commands were carried out in order to avoid disagreeable intrusions.|$|E
60|$|Here we have {{a strong}} case for {{applying}} either the licensing system or whatever better means may be devized for securing the orderly conduct of houses of public entertainment, dramatic or other. Liberty must, no doubt, be respected in so far that no manager should have the right <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>admission</b> to decently dressed, sober, and well-conducted persons, whether they are prostitutes, soldiers in uniform, gentlemen not in evening dress, Indians, or what not; but when disorder is stopped, disorderly persons will either cease to come or else reform their manners. It is, however, quite arguable that the indiscriminate issue of free admissions, though an apparently innocent and good- natured, and certainly a highly popular proceeding, should expose the proprietor of the theatre to the risk of a refusal to renew his licence.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Dosett was dignified at {{his office}} {{with the use of}} a room to himself, a small room looking out upon the river, in which he spent six hours on six days of the week in {{arranging}} the indexes of a voluminous library of manuscript letter-books. It was rarely indeed that he was disturbed by the presence of any visitor. When, therefore, his door was opened by one of the messengers, and he was informed that Lady Albury desired to see him, he was for the moment a good deal disturbed. No option, however, was given to him as <b>to</b> <b>refusing</b> <b>admission</b> <b>to</b> Lady Albury. She was in the room before the messenger had completed his announcement, and had seated herself in one of the two spare chairs which the room afforded as soon as the door was closed.

He was living like an anchorite, fasting and working hard, surrounded by books and manuscripts all day and night, and far into the small hours of the morning. He was doing penance for recent excesses; he was preparing for some wild orgies; he was writing a novel, a philosophical pamphlet, an article for the reviews, or another volume of poems.|$|R

In addition to the minister the town regularly appointed a [...] "lecturer" [...] to supplement the minister in his ministry. This lecturer might refute the morning sermon or the minister in an evening sermon. Battles were fought over the choice of ministers for the church and at times the king ordered the town's choice <b>to</b> be <b>refused</b> <b>admission</b> or tried <b>to</b> appoint his own lecturer. With increasing friction; disappointment with the Royalist tendencies of the St Andrew's incumbents; and a desire for Puritan preaching, the solution of creating a second church was mooted.|$|R

50|$|Forsyth gained {{considerable}} popularity as a probationer, {{but with}} no influence, he grew tired of waiting for a parish.

The garden that surrounded it had been allowed to run wild, and the avenue up which they walked was green with rank weeds.

50|$|Msgr.Dominic Barbero {{invited the}} Sisters of St. Ann of Divine Providence to Hyderabad Vicariate and Mother Enrichetta Dominici {{selected}} six sisters on 20 November 1870. The six Sisters arrived in Secunderabad on 3 March 1871. The Sisters were entrusted with the orphanage {{and education of}} girls. To impart education {{to the poor and}} needy the school was started on 1 April 1871 with 25 orphans and 3 boarders by the Sisters of St. Ann. By 1883 the strength had increased to 130 pupils. In November 1884 it was inspected and recognized as a Middle School. From its start the school presented pupils for the Middle School Examination for the Madras Matriculation. In May 1902 it was recognized by Madras as a European Aided High School. In 1911, the Madras Matriculation was abandoned for the Cambridge examination which was later superseded by the Indian School Certificate Examination. From 1915 candidates were sent up for the Cambridge School Certificate. From 1933 till 1941, candidates were also sent up for the HSLC introduced by the Nizam, followed later by the HSC, and now by the SSC. Throughout these years candidates were also sent up for the Trinity College of Music Examination which is still being carried as on date. For many years boys were kept in the school up to the age of eight years but it was found necessary to stop admitting boys, so as not <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>admission</b> to girls and in 1966 the last batch of boys completed their studies. There were three sections in each class imparting instruction according to the HSC Syllabus which later became the SSC course run by the State Education Department. Since the school had grown very large a decision was taken to bifurcate the SSC section from the ISC Section thus creating two separate High Schools each with a course of studies independent of the other. While bifurcating the school the St.Joseph’s Middle School, was amalgamated with the SSC Section of the St. Ann’s High School. The Kindergarten is a separate section where the children are prepared for both schools. The amalgamation and the bifurcation took place on 11-06-1970.|$|E

50|$|In 1907 {{a branch}} house was opened at East 79th Street. A Sister always slept near the door, {{since it was}} a rule of the {{community}} that no one was <b>to</b> be <b>refused</b> <b>admission</b> at any hour, day or night; the observance of this rule frequently rendered it necessary to the Sisters to give up their own beds to their humble guests. The women were kept as long as they desired to stay; if able-bodied they had to help in the laundry or at sewing, the sole support of the home; if ill, they were cared for or sent to the hospital. Catholic residents were required to attend Mass on Sundays and any Holy Day of Obligation, but this was the sole distinction between the residents of the different religions. The Sisters also visited the poor in the hospitals, and supplied free meals to men out of employment. The number of women accommodated each night was from one hundred to 125; the meals supplied to men out of work averaged daily 65.|$|R
