5|$|I've liked Tommy {{for a long}} time. He's clever, infectious, {{enthusiastic}} and a hard worker. He can play as a centre-forward, behind the centre-forward or out wide, so covers a lot of positions. He's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> asset to us.|$|E
5|$|Baron Archibald Dumas (Jeff Steitzer) – The {{president}} {{and owner of}} Dumas Industrial Enterprises is fabulously wealthy and reclusive. Not really a H.A.R.M. member, the childish and silly baron is manipulated by his wife. He claims <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> safari hunter, but is in fact not, as all his trophies are secretly bought.|$|E
5|$|Inge Wagner (Kit Harris) – A H.A.R.M. agent supervisor, Inge is an {{overweight}} German woman who believes herself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> singer, while in reality her vocalizations are terrible and feared among her subordinates. She {{is also the}} owner of a popular nightclub in Hamburg. She commands H.A.R.M. troops on-field and is one of Cate's main enemies. She is also supposedly a distant relation of Richard Wagner.|$|E
30|$|This {{study found}} {{significant}} declines in total psoas area, lean psoas area, and psoas HU from pre-treatment to 3  months post-treatment follow-up. Psoas muscle area decline is clinically significant because it correlates with deterioration in patient reported physical activity (3 out of 15 UWQOL domains) and concerns regarding cancer related physical problems (1 out of 4 HNQOL domains) from pre- to 6  months post-treatment on univariate analysis. Furthermore, decline in total psoas area independently predicts tumor recurrence in univariate and multivariate analysis adjusted for age, tumor stage, and decline in weight. In multivariate analysis, psoas muscle area loss also appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> contributor <b>to</b> tumor recurrence than T-stage, similar to results reported by Sheetz et al. (2013) who found lean psoas area <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> contributor than stage.|$|R

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the victory at Tobruk, Rommel persuaded Hitler to {{authorise}} an attack on Egypt instead of Malta, over Kesselring's objections. The parachute troops assembled for Operation Herkules were sent to Rommel. Things went well at first, with Rommel winning the Battle of Mersa Matruh, but just as Kesselring had warned, the logistical difficulties mounted and the result was the disastrous First Battle of El Alamein, Battle of Alam el Halfa and Second Battle of El Alamein. Kesselring considered Rommel <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> general leading fast-moving troops at the corps level of command, but felt that he was too moody and changeable for higher command. For Kesselring, Rommel's nervous breakdown and hospitalisation for depression {{at the end of the}} African Campaign only confirmed this.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the team had yet another stroke of luck. Bowen's former thesis advisor at King's College, London, was Edward Appleton, who had worked with Watt and Harold Pye during the 1920s. Pye had since gone on to form his own radio company, Pye Ltd., and was active in the {{television}} field. They had recently introduced a new television set based on an innovative vacuum tube developed by Philips of Holland, the EF50 pentode. Appleton mentioned the Pye design to Bowen, who found it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> improvement over the EMI version, and was happy to learn there had been a small production run {{that could be used for}} their experiments. The design became widely known as the Pye strip.|$|E
5|$|Like Ladislaus I, Coloman proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> legislator, but he {{prescribed}} {{less severe}} punishments than his uncle had done. He ordered that transactions between Christians and Jews {{were to be}} put into writing. His laws concerning his Muslim subjects aimed at their conversion, for instance, by obliging them to marry their daughters to Christians. The presence of Jewish and Muslim merchants in the kingdom was due to its role as a crossroad of trading routes leading towards Constantinople, Regensburg and Kiev. Local trade also existed, which enabled Coloman to collect the marturina, the traditional in-kind tax of Slavonia, in cash.|$|E
2500|$|In late October 1888, {{the fall}} rains <b>were</b> {{anticipated}} <b>to</b> soon {{raise the level}} of the Willamette River.

25|$|The rapid {{retreat of}} the German Nineteenth Army {{resulted}} in swift gains for the Allied forces. The plans had envisaged greater resistance near the landing areas and underestimated transport needs. The consequent need for vehicle fuel outstripped supply, and this shortage proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> impediment <b>to</b> the advance than German resistance. As a result, several German formations escaped into the Vosges and Germany.|$|R
5|$|McGovern {{attended}} Mitchell High School, {{where he}} was a solid but unspectacular member of the track team. A turning point came when his tenth-grade English teacher recommended him to the debate team, where he became quite active. His high-school debate coach, a history teacher who capitalized on McGovern's interest in that subject, proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> influence in his life, and McGovern spent many hours honing his meticulous, if colorless, forensic style. McGovern and his debating partner won events in his area and gained renown in a state where debating was passionately followed by the general public. Debate changed McGovern's life, giving him a chance to explore ideas to their logical end, broadening his perspective, and instilling a sense of personal and social confidence. He graduated in 1940 in the top ten percent of his class.|$|E
5|$|To assist at {{practice}} for the 1927 season, Krichell signed Billy Werber from Duke University. He left the team after a month, but re-signed after graduating in 1930. During that time, Krichell was involved in what {{is considered one of}} the worst deals from the era. Barrow asked him to travel to Durham, North Carolina to negotiate with the Durham Bulls for an outfielder named Dusty Cooke. Neither Krichell nor Barrow had seen Cooke; he was believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> hitter, even though he had hardly played for the Bulls. The Yankees signed him for $15,000 ($ in 2010), beating the Cleveland Indians' offer of $12,500 ($ in 2010) and an unnamed player in exchange. Cooke turned out to be an injury-prone backup outfielder, and the Yankees gave up on both Cooke and Werber. After the 1933 season, the two were traded to the Boston Red Sox for cash considerations.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} {{at the foot of}} the settlement, Eric besieged and attacked the city, but was repelled. Led by duke Višeslav, the inhabitants of Trsat threw spears, shot arrows, and hurled huge stones on the enemy, and managed to kill many of them. Eric's forces fled their positions, and were subsequently routed by the forces of Višeslav in an ambush. Eric was among those killed, and his death and defeat proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> blow for the Carolingian Empire. Aquileian Patriarch Saint Paulinus II cursed the land in which the hero was killed, and wrote Carmen de regula fidei, the rhythmus or elegy for his death.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{praise for}} the {{importance}} of the volumes, the work was not produced beyond 300 copies. Many other works <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> issued; the economics of producing a more affordable volume <b>were</b> yet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> refined. The publication by Curtis, The Botanical Magazine, <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> financial success. Sowerby, who helped to publish the volumes and give over seventy of the plates, went on to produce natural history publications in a similar format.|$|R
50|$|A {{necessary}} and sufficient condition for <b>a</b> Heyting algebra <b>to</b> <b>be</b> subdirectly irreducible <b>is</b> for there <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>greatest</b> element strictly below 1. The witnessing pair is that element and 1, and identifying any other pair a, b of elements identifies both a→b and b→a with 1 thereby collapsing everything above those two implications to 1. Hence every finite chain {{of two or}} more elements as <b>a</b> Heyting algebra <b>is</b> subdirectly irreducible.|$|R
5|$|After departing New Richmond, {{the tornado}} moved {{on toward the}} northeast, {{continuing}} along a course almost parallel to the Omaha Railroad line, with most of its destruction after that point confined to rural areas, with only two fatalities occurring north of town. The tornado struck several farms in the Stanton area, passing barely a mile north of the village of Deer Park before crossing into Polk County. The storm came within two miles of the village of Clear Lake, proving <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> scare for its residents as it reminded many of a similar tornado which struck Clear Lake in September 1884. A large number of farms in the area suffered considerable damage, and many families were left homeless. One farmer, Sam Olson was killed instantly when the tornado flattened his farmstead, leaving {{his wife and son}} gravely injured. Northeast of Clear Lake, the tornado tore through the logging community of Pineville, where another farmer, Michael Kennetz, was killed when his home was swept away. Several homes and farms {{in the vicinity of the}} hamlet of Richardson and the village of Clayton were blown away, leaving several families destitute. The storm continued east into Barron County, where the farming community of Arland sustained a direct hit, with virtually the entire settlement being demolished, but no fatalities or serious injuries being reported. The tornado dissipated a few miles southwest of the city of Barron, although the storm was still strong enough to cause a considerable amount of damage to the town.|$|E
5|$|Harold Larwood {{maintained}} {{great respect}} for Jardine, treasuring a gift his captain gave him after the Bodyline tour and believing him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> man. Jardine showed affection for Larwood in return even after both of their retirements; he expressed his concern for the way Larwood was treated, hosted a lunch for the former fast bowler shortly before he emigrated to Australia and met him there in 1954. On the other hand, Donald Bradman would never speak to journalists about Bodyline or Jardine, and refused to give a tribute when Jardine died in 1958. Jack Fingleton {{admitted that he had}} liked Jardine and stated that he and Larwood had each done their job on the Bodyline tour, and expressed regret at the way both left cricket in acrimonious circumstances. Fingleton also described Jardine as an aloof individual who preferred to take his time in judging a person before befriending them, a quality that caused problems in Australia. Bill O'Reilly stated that he disliked Jardine at the time of Bodyline, but on meeting him later found him agreeable and even charming.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{economic}} success allowed Busch to visit Wiedensahl more frequently. Busch {{had decided to}} leave Munich, as only few relatives lived there, and the artists' association was temporarily disbanded. In June 1867 Busch met his brother Otto for the first time, in Frankfurt. Otto {{was working as a}} tutor to the family of a wealthy banker and industrialist, Kessler. Busch became friends with Kessler's wife, Johanna, a mother of seven and an influential art and music patron of Frankfurt. She regularly opened salons at her villa, frequented by artists, musicians and philosophers. She believed Busch <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> painter, a view supported by Anton Burger, a leading painter of the Kronberger Malerkolonie, the Kronberg-based group of painters. While his humorous drawings did not appeal to her, she supported his painting career. At first she established an apartment and studio for Busch in her villa, later providing him with an apartment nearby. Motivated by Kessler's support and admiration, and introduction to the cultural life of Frankfurt, the 'Frankfurter Years' were the most artistically productive for Busch. At this time he and Otto discovered the philosophical works of Arthur Schopenhauer.|$|E
5|$|When the {{reactivation}} {{of the s}} <b>was</b> under consideration, <b>a</b> radical {{design for}} a battleship-carrier hybrid emerged that would have replaced the ship's rear turret with a flight deck, complete with a hangar and two ski jumps, for operating several Harriers. However, the USMC considered the need for naval gunfire support <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> priority than additional platforms for carrier operations, while the cost and delay associated with such elaborate conversions was significant, and the concept was dropped.|$|R

The plutonium could {{be separated from the}} americium by several different processes; these would include pyrochemical processes and aqueous/organic solvent extraction. A truncated PUREX type extraction process would be one possible method of making the separation.|$|R
5|$|The {{objective}} for the 11th as the attacking {{force was}} to capture Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield near Fort Bragg in North Carolina, {{after which the}} maneuver was named. The defending forces were to try to defend the airport {{and the surrounding area}} and repel the airborne assault. The entire operation would be observed by Lieutenant General McNair. His observations and reports to the U.S. War Department, and ultimately General Eisenhower, would do much to decide {{the success or failure of}} the exercise. The Knollwood Maneuver took place on the night of 7 December, with the troops of the 11th Airborne Division being delivered to thirteen separate objectives by 200 C-47 Dakota transport aircraft and 234 Waco CG-4A gliders, with eighty-five percent of the airborne troops being delivered to their target without navigational error. The transport aircraft were divided into four groups, each taking off from a different airfield in the Carolinas, with two groups dropping paratroopers and two towing gliders, and between them deployed 4,800 airborne troops in the first wave. These airborne troops then seized the Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield from the defending troops and secured the area in which the rest of the division landed, all before daylight. Having secured their initial objectives, the 11th Airborne Division then conducted a coordinated ground attack against a reinforced infantry regiment, as well as several aerial resupply and casualty evacuation missions in coordination with transport aircraft. The exercise was judged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> success by those who observed it. McNair reported that the success of the maneuver pleased him, and highlighted the great improvements in airborne training that had occurred in the months between the end of Operation Husky and the Knollwood Maneuver. Due to the success of the units of the 11th Airborne Division during the exercise, the divisional-sized airborne force was deemed to be effective and was allowed by Eisenhower to remain.|$|E
