40|$|Mate choice {{has been}} {{considered}} to be a uniquely female behaviour. However, recent studies suggest <b>that</b> <b>males</b> strategically allocate their sperm among females with the greatest reproductive value. We investigated mating behaviour in the direct-developing Northern Pacific gastropod, Littorina subrotundata. Our field survey showed significant sexual dimorphism and the presence of size-assortative mating in our study population. Laboratory studies demonstrated <b>that</b> larger <b>males</b> may physically out-compete smaller males for access to females. Additional laboratory mate-choice exper-iments showed <b>that</b> <b>males</b> preferentially copulated with larger females. We also found <b>that</b> <b>males</b> {{were significantly more likely to}} copulate with virgin females than with females that had recently copulated. This suggests <b>that</b> <b>males</b> can detect the presence of sperm from rival males within a female’s reproductive tract...|$|R

5|$|A {{persistent}} folktale on Sumatra and Borneo and {{in popular}} culture, is <b>that</b> <b>male</b> orangutans display sexual attraction to human women, {{and may even}} forcibly copulate with them. The only serious, but anecdotal, report of such an incident taking place, is primatologist Birutė Galdikas' report that her cook was sexually assaulted by a male orangutan. This orangutan, though, was raised in captivity and may have suffered from a skewed species identity, and forced copulation is a standard mating strategy for low-ranking male orangutans.|$|E
5|$|Halotus {{was also}} {{known to have}} been a eunuch. There are many {{possible}} reasons for this but the most likely is related to the possibility of sexual contact between servant and master; a prohibition against sexual contact between royalty and servants, guards and slaves was not uncommon {{in many parts of the}} world during Halotus' era and it was thought <b>that</b> <b>male</b> castration would prevent this. Halotus may have been required to submit to castration in order to hold his position.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} how the {{described}} genetic defects increase the Na+/K+-ATPase activity, but it is suspected that the enzyme becomes more active due to increased thyroid hormone levels. Hyperthyroidism increases the levels of catecholamines (such as adrenaline) in the blood, increasing Na+/K+-ATPase activity. The enzyme activity is then increased further by the precipitating causes. For instance, increased carbohydrate intake leads to increased insulin levels; this is known to activate Na+/K+-ATPase. Once the precipitant is removed, the enzyme activity returns to normal levels. It has been postulated <b>that</b> <b>male</b> hormones increase Na+/K+-ATPase activity, and that this explains why males are at a higher risk of TPP despite thyroid disease being more common in females.|$|E
50|$|Many species {{demonstrate}} polyterritoriality, {{referring to}} the act of claiming or defending more than one territory. In the European pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca), researchers assert <b>that</b> <b>males</b> exhibit polyterritoriality to deceive females of the species into entering into polygynous relationships. This hypothesis, named the deception hypothesis, claims <b>that</b> <b>males</b> have territories at distances sufficiently great that females are unable to discern already-mated <b>males.</b> The observation <b>that</b> <b>males</b> travelled long distances, ranging from 200m to 3.5 km, to find a second mate supports this the argument. The debate about polyterritoriality in this species may initiate research about the evolution and reasons for polyterritoriality in other unrelated species.|$|R

5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged <b>that</b> <b>male</b> workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack.

30|$|Seasonal {{movement}} patterns of either species {{are not well}} documented. However, a study on E. wahlbergi in the urbanized environment of Pietermaritzburg campus, University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, showed <b>that</b> <b>males</b> and females had larger home ranges in winter compared to spring and <b>that</b> <b>males</b> on average were relatively sedentary throughout the year (having relatively small home ranges). Females, on average, made longer flights and had much larger home ranges (Rollinson et al. 2013). Our observations that both species mate within the same timeframe and <b>that</b> <b>males</b> of both species set up calling perches in proximity to fruiting fig trees in KNP resulted in us proposing the hypothesis <b>that</b> the <b>males</b> of each epauletted fruit bat species should show differences in mating calls to avoid cross-mating with the other species even though, to the human ear, little to no discernible differences are evident.|$|R

5|$|Although zduhaći (plural) {{could be}} women and children, most were adult men. Their supernatural power {{was thought to}} be inborn. In many regions it was {{regarded}} that the zduhaći were born with a caul—white or red, depending on the regional belief. The mother would dry the caul and sew into a piece of garment always worn by the child, such as a pouch attached under the child's armpit. In the clan of Kuči, eastern Montenegro, the mother would preserve the caul hiding it from all eyes, and hand it to her son when he grew up. The caul was supposed to protect him when he flew as a zduhać. If the caul was destroyed, the child's supernatural power would be lost. A birthmark of a zduhać in Herzegovina could be a tuft of hair growing on his shoulder or upper arm. In Montenegrin Littoral, the caul played no role in the birth of zduhaći, who were rather born on certain Fridays at a set hour. There was also a belief in Herzegovina <b>that</b> <b>male</b> children who were conceived on the eves of great feast days would become zduhaći.|$|E
5|$|As her fame grew, Coffin {{gained the}} {{opportunity}} to put her design principles into practice on a larger scale. Her practice had grown large {{enough for her to}} need an assistant by 1911, and by 1918 she had moved her office to larger premises at 830 Lexington Avenue. She also took on James Scheiner, an architect, as an associate. He became a key part of Coffin's practice, working on large-scale tasks such as overseeing work on the ground. This in turn opened up new opportunities for her to take on new, larger commissions. Coffin insisted on being paid the same fees as a male architect and to be treated equally in contracts; this was a novelty in itself, at a time when women were usually paid less than men. She also liked to employ women to work with her on commissions, giving them the chance to undertake apprenticeships <b>that</b> <b>male</b> prejudice had denied her when she had first started on her career.|$|E
5|$|Luzzaschi's book of madrigals for one, two, {{and three}} sopranos with {{keyboard}} accompaniment, published in 1601, comprises works written throughout the 1580s. This music {{may have been}} kept back from publication {{in order to maintain}} the secrecy of Alfonso's musica secreta, and to maintain control over it. Newcomb considers this publication the exemplar of the ladies' signature musical style. In 1584, Alessandro Striggio, responding to requests from Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, described the ladies and composed pieces imitating their style so that Francesco could start his own concerto delle donne. Striggio mentioned an ornamented four voice madrigal for three sopranos and a dialogue with imitative diminutions for two sopranos. He added that he had forgotten the intabulation for the madrigal in Mantua, and noted that the skilled singer Giulio Caccini could play the bass part on either lute or harpsichord. This indicates both <b>that</b> <b>male</b> singers were probably not used after Brancaccio, and that instrumental accompaniments were a common and acceptable means of filling in the counterpoint.|$|E

5|$|Some of Aristotle's {{observations}} were not taken seriously by science {{until they were}} independently rediscovered in the 19th century. For example, he recorded <b>that</b> <b>male</b> octopuses have a hectocotylus, a tentacle which stores sperm and which can transfer it into the female's body; sometimes it snaps off during mating. The account was dismissed as fanciful until the French naturalist Georges Cuvier described it in his 1817 Le Règne Animal. Aristotle {{also noted that the}} young of the dogfish grow inside their mother's body attached by a cord to something like a placenta (a yolk sac). This was confirmed in 1842 by the German zoologist Johannes Peter Müller. Aristotle noted, too, that a river catfish which he called the glanis cares for its young, as the female leaves after giving birth; the male guards the eggs for forty or fifty days, chasing off small fish which threaten the eggs, and making a murmuring noise. The Swiss American zoologist Louis Agassiz found the account to be correct in 1890.|$|E
5|$|The flame robin {{is found}} in {{temperate}} regions of southeastern Australia and all over Tasmania, although it is less common in the southwest and west. In Victoria, it {{is more common in}} uplands than lower altitudes. It ranges from the Adelaide and Murray Plains around the mouth of the Murray River in southeastern South Australia, across Victoria and into the South West Slopes and southern regions of New South Wales. Further north, it is found along the Great Dividing Range and its western slopes, with a few records from southeast Queensland. Within its range, it is generally migratory, moving from alpine and subalpine regions to lowlands in winter, although the breeding and non-breeding ranges overlap. There is some evidence <b>that</b> <b>male</b> birds migrate several days before females. It is unclear what proportion of Tasmanian birds cross Bass Strait to winter in Victoria. Birds which remain in Tasmania move away from breeding areas and are found in paddocks in loose flocks of up to fourteen birds. They have left these areas by August, and immature birds appear to disperse earlier. A field study in the outer Melbourne suburb of Langwarrin showed that climate did not influence peak abundance of Flame Robins there. The international organization BirdLife International has regraded it from Least Concern to Near Threatened in 2004 due to its population decline over the previous 25 years. The Australian Government had classified it as Least Concern, but noted evidence of decline at the edges of its non-breeding range; it has become rare in South Australia and Victoria. Flame robins are not rare in Victoria. They are frequently encountered at high elevations on the Great Dividing Range, especially in sparser snow gum woodland and similar habitat, and during the summer breeding season {{are one of the most}} reliably observed species around the summit of Mount Macedon, NW of Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{is common}} to confuse Bateman's ideas with those of later scientists, his {{principle}} can be expressed in three simple statements. The first is <b>that</b> <b>male</b> reproductive success increases with the number of mates they attempt to copulate with, while female reproductive success does not. The second is <b>that</b> <b>male</b> reproductive success will show greater variance than female. The third is that sexual selection will have a greater effect on the sex with greater variance in reproductive success.|$|E
40|$|Males vary in {{the degree}} to which they invest in mating. Several factors can explain this variation, {{including}} differences in males’ individual condition and the fact <b>that</b> <b>males</b> allocate their energy depending on the context they face in each mating attempt. Particularly, female quality affects male reproductive success. Here, we studied whether male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) strategically allocated more mating effort, in terms of mating behaviour and male–male competition, when they were matched with a receptive (R) female than a non-receptive one. In accordance with our prediction, we found <b>that</b> <b>males</b> increased their mating behaviour when they were with a receptive female. Even though male guppies can inseminate non-receptive females, we only found high levels of courtship between <b>males</b> <b>that</b> were with a receptive female rather than a non-receptive one. Although there was little affect of female receptivity on male–male competition, we found <b>that</b> <b>males</b> chased and interrupted courtships more with receptive females than with non-receptive females regardless of odour. Finally, we also studied whether the sexual pheromone produced by receptive female guppies is a cue <b>that</b> <b>males</b> use in order to increase their mating effort. We found <b>that</b> <b>males</b> were more attracted to a female when they perceived the sexual pheromone, but only increased their mating and aggressive behaviours when females showed receptive behaviour. This strategic increase in mating effort could result in higher male reproductive success because mating attempts towards receptive females are likely to be less costly and males could have a greater probability of fertilisation...|$|R

Although males {{of a number of}} species of insects and fishes have been shown to allocate sperm strategically, we provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence that an avian species is also capable of allocating ejaculates. Male Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) are more likely to transfer sperm during extra-pair copulations (EPCs) than during pair copulations. We investigated the question of how males allocate ejaculates within the constraints of limited sperm availability and found (i) <b>that</b> <b>males</b> <b>that</b> engaged in EPC attempts ejaculated less often when copulating with their social partner than <b>males</b> <b>that</b> made no EPC attempts, and (ii) that {{there was no difference between}} <b>males</b> <b>that</b> were involved in failed EPC attempts and those that were involved in successful EPCs in the proportion of copulations that resulted in sperm transfer.
