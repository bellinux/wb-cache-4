5|$|A {{flashback}} {{reveals that}} Ponnar and Sankar are actually Thamarai's sons and that Rakki, {{who was then}} a servant of Nellaiyankondan, had saved the twins as small children from Mandhiyappan. Mandhiyappan had attempted to avenge himself on Thamarai for rejecting his hand in marriage. He learns that the <b>twins</b> <b>are</b> still alive and hatches a conspiracy to kill them. He tricks Kali Mannan (Napoleon) and Thamarai's father into helping him. This leads to an intense battle which ends with good prevailing over evil.|$|E

5|$|Mature bulls {{can weigh}} up to 800 {{kilograms}} (1,800pounds) and cows can weigh up to 500 kilograms (1,100pounds). Cows typically have {{a height of}} 90–106centimeters (3–3.5ft), and bulls are typically {{in the range of}} 106–120centimeters (3.5–4ft). Mating occurs throughout the year with a gestation period of approximately 277–290 days. Most commonly a single calf is born, but <b>twins</b> <b>are</b> not unknown. Sexual maturity is reached at about eighteen months. Highland cattle also have a longer expected lifespan than most other breeds of cattle, up to 20 years.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} {{of sister}} states, regions, and cities in the U.S. state of Florida. Sister cities, known in Europe as town <b>twins,</b> <b>are</b> cities which partner with each other to promote human contact and {{cultural}} links, although this partnering is not limited to cities and often includes counties, regions, states and other sub-national entities.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts {{approximately}} 340days, with {{an average}} range 320–370 days, and usually results in one foal; <b>twins</b> <b>are</b> rare. Horses are a precocial species, and foals are capable of standing and running {{within a short time}} following birth. Foals are usually born in the spring. The estrous cycle of a mare occurs roughly every 19–22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn. Most mares enter an anestrus period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period. Foals are generally weaned from their mothers between four and six months of age.|$|E

50|$|In the past, {{the use of}} {{terminology}} {{when describing}} parasitic <b>twins</b> has <b>been</b> somewhat inconsistent. By definition, a parasitic <b>twin</b> <b>is</b> joined to another twin in a certain anatomical location or position on the developed twin's body. The underdeveloped <b>twin</b> <b>is</b> termed the parasite, and the developed <b>twin</b> <b>is</b> termed the autosite. The autosite can have some abnormalities, as well. For the most part, however, it has developed enough that it can live on its own.|$|R

5|$|In 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne {{considered}} {{the case of}} the Biddenden Maids from a teratological perspective. He suggested that they had in fact been pygopagus (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus <b>twins</b> <b>are</b> known to put their arms around each other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.|$|E
5|$|In {{identical}} twins, if one {{is affected}} there is a 50–60% chance that the other will also be affected. In non-identical twins the risk is 15%. These risks are greater in those with generalized rather than focal seizures. If both <b>twins</b> <b>are</b> affected, {{most of the time}} they have the same epileptic syndrome (70–90%). Other close relatives of a person with epilepsy have a risk five times that of the general population. Between 1 and 10% of those with Down syndrome and 90% of those with Angelman syndrome have epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis is {{generally}} {{thought to be}} a genetic disease that is triggered by environmental factors. In twin studies, identical <b>twins</b> <b>are</b> {{three times more likely to}} be affected compared to non-identical twins. This suggests that genetic factors predispose to psoriasis. Symptoms often worsen during winter and with certain medications, such as beta blockers or NSAIDs. Infections and psychological stress can also play a role. Psoriasis is not contagious. The underlying mechanism involves the immune system reacting to skin cells. Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms.|$|E

5|$|With the {{exception}} of the walrus, which has five- to six-year-long inter-birth intervals, female pinnipeds enter estrous shortly after they give birth. All species go through delayed implantation, wherein the embryo remains in suspended development for weeks or months before it is implanted in the uterus. Delayed implantation postpones the birth of young until the female hauls-out on land or until conditions for birthing are favorable. Gestation in seals (including delayed implantation) typically lasts a year. For most species, birthing takes place {{in the spring and summer}} months. Typically, single pups are born; <b>twins</b> <b>are</b> uncommon and have high mortality rates. Pups of most species are born precocial. Unlike terrestrial mammals, pinniped milk has little to no lactose.|$|E
5|$|Gestational period varies among bovids - while duiker {{gestation}} {{ranges from}} 120 to 150 days, gestation in African buffalo ranges from 300 to 330 days. Usually, a single offspring is born (<b>twins</b> <b>are</b> less frequent), {{and it is}} able to stand and run by itself within an hour of birth. In monogamous species, males assist in defending their young, {{but that is not the}} case in polygynous species. Most newborn calves remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their mothers. In some bovid species the neonates start following about their mothers immediately or within a few days, as in the impala. Different bovids have different strategies for defence of juveniles. For instance, while wildebeest mothers solely defend their young, buffaloes exhibit collective defence. Weaning might occur as early as two months (as in royal antelope) or as late as a year (as in muskox).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{formability}} of magnesium alloys at low temperatures, {{a thorough understanding of}} the <b>twinning</b> behaviour <b>is</b> required. Cylindrical samples were compressed uniaxially from room temperature to 250 o C, with the compression axis parallel to the transverse direction (TD) of a hot-rolled Mg- 3 Al- 1 Zn sheet. <b>Twinning</b> <b>was</b> investigated by use of orientation maps constructed from electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) data. Tensile <b>twinning</b> <b>was</b> observed at all temperatures. In some grains two <b>twin</b> variants <b>were</b> observed. For each twin the specific twinning variant among the 6 possible <b>twinning</b> systems <b>was</b> identified by consideration of the twinning rotation. The <b>twinning</b> <b>was</b> then investigated by comparing the specific twin variant with the calculated Schmid factors for all 6 possible twin variants. In cases of grains that are completely reoriented by two <b>twin</b> variants it <b>is</b> possible to back-calculate the initial grain orientation by considering all possible twin rotations for both of the <b>twin</b> variants.

40|$|<b>Twinning</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} deformation mode of hexagonal close-packed metals. The crystallographic theory {{is based on}} the 150 -years old concept of simple shear.

Here we present Electron BackScatter Diffraction observations and crystallographic analysis of a millimeter size twin in a magnesium single crystal whose straight habit plane, unambiguously determined both the parent crystal and in its <b>twin,</b> <b>is</b> not an invariant plane. This experimental evidence demonstrates that macroscopic deformation <b>twinning</b> can <b>be</b> obtained by a mechanism that is not a simple shear. Beside, this unconventional <b>twin</b> <b>is</b> often co-formed with a new conventional twin that exhibits the lowest shear magnitude ever reported in metals.
