(A practical Fourier <b>transform</b> spectrometer would substitute corner cube reflectors for the flat mirrors of the conventional Michelson interferometer, but for simplicity, the illustration does not show this.) An interferogram is generated by making measurements of the signal at many discrete positions of the moving mirror. A Fourier <b>transform</b> converts the interferogram into an actual spectrum.|$|E

In video compression, however, prediction residuals of image intensities, such as the motion compensation residual or the resolution enhancement residual, are <b>transformed.</b> The applicability of the directional <b>transforms</b> on prediction residuals have not been carefully investigated. In this paper, we briefly discuss differing characteristics of prediction residuals and images, and propose directional <b>transforms</b> specifically designed for prediction residuals.
