Results highlight {{the superiority of}} the NR with regard to udder health and suggest that improvements to udder health may result from crossbreeding with the NR.|$|E
50|$|In 2010 Scurr, White and Hedger {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} effect of breast support on the movement of the breast during the running gait cycle. The aim of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>investigate</b> the multi-directional breast displacement, velocity and acceleration with and without breast support during running and also to establish the correlation with breast comfort. 15 D cup participants were used and all regularly participated in exercise. Using treadmill running in three different bra conditions, (No bra, T-shirt bra and sports bra) they concluded that breast displacement and velocity were reduced as breast support increased and that no particular direction of breast movement showed a stronger relationship to breast pain. Further to this they found that breast discomfort was most closely correlated to breast velocity.|$|E
