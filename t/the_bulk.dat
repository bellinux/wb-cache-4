40|$|A {{frequency}} mixing apparatus is provided. In {{the frequency}} mixing apparatus, a PMOS transistor is coupled to an NMOS transistor in a cascode configuration and an LO signal {{is applied to}} <b>the</b> <b>bulks</b> of <b>the</b> PMOS and NMOS transistors so that an input signal applied to their gates is mixed with the LO signal. High isolation between <b>the</b> <b>bulks</b> and gates of the transistors resulting from application of the LO signal to <b>the</b> <b>bulks</b> prevents leakage of the LO signal, thereby decreasing a DC offset voltage. This renders the frequency mixing applicable to a DCR. Also, due to the cascade configuration similar to an inverter configuration, the frequency mixing apparatus can be incorporated in an FPGA of a MODEM in SDR applications. Frequency mixing based on switching of a threshold voltage decreases a noise factor and enables frequency mixing in a low supply voltage range, thereby decreasing power consumption.

30|$|The {{essential}} {{difference among}} the three schemes is their treatment of the size distribution {{of the number of}} hydrometeor particles. <b>The</b> one-moment <b>bulk</b> scheme expresses this value by the Marshall–Palmer distribution, with the assumption of a constant total number of particles. By this assumption, only the mass concentration is needed to determine the size distribution. Although <b>the</b> two-moment <b>bulk</b> scheme conceptually treats the size distribution almost the same way, it differs from <b>the</b> one-moment <b>bulk</b> scheme in <b>the</b> assumption about the type of size distribution function and in the process of its determination. <b>The</b> two-moment <b>bulk</b> scheme assumes <b>the</b> generalized gamma distribution as the size distribution function, and the size distribution itself is determined not only by the mass concentration but also by the number concentration. In this sense, <b>the</b> two-moment <b>bulk</b> scheme is more sophisticated than <b>the</b> one-moment <b>bulk</b> scheme. <b>The</b> spectral bin scheme is an intrinsically sophisticated method compared with the others. It explicitly predicts the size distribution. To compensate for the detailed expression of size distribution, the spectral bin scheme requires about four- to fivefold larger number of prognostic variables compared with the other two schemes.|$|R
