Munro goes on to argue that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> slaying the deer would be when they are moving uphill (when gravity is against them), their principle home being in the heights. Contemporary with Munro, substantial stone walls were built in the glens to funnel deer into pens.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman Turkish Empire {{entered the}} First World War {{on the side}} of the Central Powers on 31 October 1914. The {{stalemate}} of trench warfare on the Western Front convinced the British Imperial War Cabinet that an attack on the Central Powers elsewhere, particularly Turkey, could be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> winning the war. From February 1915 this took the form of naval operations aimed at forcing a passage through the Dardanelles, but after several setbacks it was decided that a land campaign was also necessary. To that end, the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force was formed under the command of General Ian Hamilton. Three amphibious landings were planned to secure the Gallipoli Peninsula, which would allow the navy to attack the Turkish capital Constantinople, in the hope that would convince the Turks to ask for an armistice.|$|E

5|$|In April the {{government}} formed the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and completed the disarmament of Okello's remaining FMF militia. On 26 April Karume {{announced that a}} union had been negotiated with Tanganyika to form the new country of Tanzania. The merger was seen by contemporary media {{as a means of}} preventing communist subversion of Zanzibar; at least one historian states that it may have been an attempt by Karume, a moderate socialist, to limit the influence of the radically left-wing Umma Party. Babu had become close to Chinese diplomats who had arranged for several shipments of arms to be sent to Zanzibar to allow the Umma Party to have a paramilitary wing. Both Karume and President Nyerere of Tanganyika were concerned that Zanzibar was starting to become a hot-spot of Cold War tensions as American and British diplomats competed for influence with Soviet, Chinese and East German diplomats, and having a union with the non-aligned Tanganyika was considered <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> removing Zanzibar from the world spotlight.

25|$|In {{order for}} the {{civilian}} authority to maintain control, it needed to {{have a way to}} direct the military without unduly infringing on the prerogatives of the military world and thus provoking a backlash.

The problem facing civilian authority, then, is in deciding on the ideal amount of control.
