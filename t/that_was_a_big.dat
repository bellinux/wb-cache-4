They're exactly wrong. There had been no reelected Republican majority since 1928. Part of the reason we got reelected... is our base thought we were serious. And they thought we were serious because when it came to a show-down, we didn't flinch." [...] In a 2011 op-ed in The Washington Post, Gingrich said that the government shutdown led to the balanced-budget deal in 1997 and the first four consecutive balanced budgets since the 1920s, as well as the first re-election of a Republican majority since 1928.|$|E

They said, 'Okay, John, you’ll do a scene naked.' I said 'Okay.' And so <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> surprise. So I do this scene, this strange scene with Anna Torv, without any clothes on. Anna’s {{staying at the}} Bishop house with Walter running around with no clothes on except {{for a pair of}} slippers, getting breakfast. She comes round the corner and catches him in the full monty, going, 'Oh no!' Didn’t know where to look. That {{was probably one of the}} most fun things we ever did.

It's like she's carrying him on her back. She needs to perform for two people now. She has to compensate for him so all her energy is in the water. The only area where she feels slightly free is when she's in the water swimming like crazy, so it's interesting having that as a character trait, and then having that as a key element for her trying to escape." ...|$|E
