500|$|However, {{the film}} {{received}} several negative reviews. Richard Schickel of Time wrote that after [...] "a {{third of a}} century's hard use", Bond's conventions survived on [...] "wobbly knees", while in Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman thought the series had [...] "entered a near-terminal state of exhaustion." [...] Dragan Antulov said that GoldenEye had a predictable series of scenes, and Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said that the film was [...] "a middle-aged entity anxious to appear trendy at all costs". David Eimer of Premiere wrote that [...] "the trademark humour is in short supply" [...] and that [...] "Goldeneye isn't classic Bond {{by any stretch of}} the imagination." [...] Madeleine Williams said that [...] "there are plenty of stunts and explosions <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> mind off the plot." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{his role}} as an enigmatic master thief in Dhoom 2 (2006)—an action sequel co-starring Aishwarya Rai, Bipasha Basu and Abhishek Bachchan—Roshan won his third Filmfare Award for Best Actor. The film critic Rajeev Masand called him [...] "the heart, the soul, {{and the spirit of}} the film", and praised his stunts, {{concluding}} that he [...] "holds the film together and even manages <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> attention away from its many flaws". Bored by playing the [...] "good guy", Roshan was excited to play a villain for the first time. At the request of the film's producer Aditya Chopra, Roshan lost [...] for the role, and learned skateboarding, snow boarding, rollerblading and sand surfing. With earnings of , Dhoom 2 became the highest-grossing Indian film of all time, a distinction it held for two years. In the 2007 melodrama Om Shanti Om, he made a cameo alongside several Bollywood stars.|$|E
500|$|The ride {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{upon its}} July 2014 opening. Lance Hart from Screamscape {{was impressed with}} the fact that the King's Cross entrance was hidden from the rest of the Diagon Alley area. He also credited Universal for making the train look as realistic as possible: [...] "Clearly they went to great lengths to create these cars to be replicas of what you see in the films, both on the outside as well as on the inside as you move down the hallway towards your cabin <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> seat". In terms of the overall experience Hart said, [...] "Universal has managed to turn what would simply be a method of transporting guests between their two parks into yet another must-see attraction ... tying together the overall story and theme of visiting Hogwarts at Islands of Adventure and Diagon Alley inside Universal Studios Florida".|$|E

Mark's social networking site featured in [...] "Boys' Club" [...] included the character {{with a wide range}} of promiscuous women. The pictures were shot during a photo session during which, according to series co-creator Michael Schur, [...] "We brought in a lot of women and basically said, you're really trashy. You're trashy women, and we're going <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> picture now." [...] During the courtyard party scenes, a brief clip shows Poehler, Jones and Schneider dancing together. The clip was actually the three actors out-of-character playing around between takes, but the Parks producers decided to add it to the episode.|$|E
500|$|Hartley {{is quick}} to point out that before [...] "Justice", the series did not focus on [...] "the costumes and the capes, the flying and the superhero stuff", because they have their [...] "no flights, no tights" [...] rule in effect. That changed with [...] "Justice", and Hartley {{suggested}} that the actors really had to commit themselves to their roles while wearing the costumes, [...] "otherwise you look like a standup comedian who doesn't like his jokes very much". Young stated that he was one of the luckiest out of the group, because he only had to wear a silver vest and regular pants, unlike Ritchson, who had to put on a [...] "onesie Speedo". Ritchson felt you could get distracted by what you were wearing, but it was best to try <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> mind off of the subject. Hartley, Ritchson, and Young stated that they felt sorry for Gallner for having to wear a costume that they believed [...] "sucked". The group described Gallner's costume as something his mom might have made with [...] "some cotton fabric and a Magic Marker".|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} several actors playing paparazzi {{throughout}} the video, Hunter included several shots of actual French paparazzi on scooters, {{who attempted to}} photograph Carey during the video's filming. Hunter claimed the additions made the video feel more realistic.

When describing the experience filming in the boutique, Carey explained: [...] "Obviously, being able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> pick of anything in the store and have the whole store shut down for you is every girl's dream. You know, just a pretty standard {{day in the life of}} anybody. No, just joking. There was a time in my life I only had one pair of shoes, so that's my justification for having that little perk on the job."

500|$|Benzema {{was called}} up to the senior team {{for the first time}} under manager Paul Le Guen during the break leading up to {{the second half of the}} season. As is {{customary}} with new players arriving at Lyon, the young striker had to stand up and speak to his new teammates, which at that time included the likes of Michael Essien, Sylvain Wiltord, Florent Malouda and Éric Abidal. While speaking, Benzema was subjected to jokes and laughter, which prompted the youngster to declare, [...] "Do not laugh, I'm here <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> place." [...] He, subsequently, made his professional debut on 15 January 2005 against Metz, appearing as a substitute for Pierre-Alain Frau. Lyon won the match 2–0 as Benzema provided the assist on the second goal scored by Bryan Bergougnoux. He would subsequently sign his first professional contract, agreeing to a three-year deal. After making three more appearances as a substitute, on 2 April Benzema made his first professional start in a 1–0 win over Lens. He finished the campaign with six appearances as Lyon won its fourth-straight league title.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} much less {{politically}} focused than it later became under Jon Stewart, having what Stephen Colbert described as a local news feel and involving more character-driven humor as opposed to news-driven humor. Winstead recalls that when the show was first launched there was constant debate regarding what the show's focus should be. While she wanted a more news-driven focus, the network was concerned that this would not appeal to viewers and pushed for [...] "a little more of a hybrid of entertainment and politics". The show was slammed by some reviewers as being too mean-spirited, particularly towards the interview subjects of field pieces; a criticism acknowledged {{by some of the}} show's cast. Describing his time as a correspondent under Kilborn, Colbert says, [...] "You wanted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> soul off, put it on a wire hanger, and leave it in the closet before you got on the plane to do one of these pieces." [...] One reviewer from The New York Times criticized the show for being too cruel and for lacking a central editorial vision or ideology, describing it as [...] "bereft of an ideological or artistic center... precocious but empty." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1965–66 NBA season, Auerbach {{announced}} {{the coming year}} {{would be his last}} as coach, stating {{to the rest of the}} league, [...] "This is your chance <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> last shot at me." [...] After losing game 1 of the 1966 finals to the Lakers, he publicly named his successor, center Bill Russell. The Celtics won the series in seven games, sending Auerbach out on top. Russell then took over as a player-coach, and so became the first African-American head coach ever in the four major North American professional team sports. While his pupil led the Celtics to two further titles in 1968 and 1969, Auerbach rebuilt the aging Celtics with shrewd draft picks, among them future Hall-of-Famers Dave Cowens and Jo Jo White, as well as Paul Westphal and Don Chaney. With his ex-player Tom Heinsohn coaching the Celtics and led by former sixth man John Havlicek, Auerbach's new recruits won the Atlantic Division every year from 1972 to 1976, winning the NBA title in 1974 and 1976. Auerbach also signed veteran forward/center Paul Silas and ex-ABA star Charlie Scott.|$|E

500|$|Media {{reactions}} to the race were positive, with Kevin Eason of The Times saying, [...] "What the inaugural Rockingham 500 CART FedEx race in Britain lacked in quantity, it made up for with driving of the highest quality." [...] He reserved praise for de Ferran's last lap overtake on Bräck, calling it [...] "astonishing". Writing for The Sunday Telegraph, Brough Scott stated, [...] "Births have always come with their share of noise, difficulty, danger and the odd touch of absurdity. But never can all the elements have been mixed as heavily as in yesterday's much-delayed launch of the Rockingham 500, which opened and closed with overtaking manoeuvres dramatic enough <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> breath away." [...] Richard Williams of The Guardian wrote, [...] "the 38,000 people who had battled against uncertainty and Silverstone-style traffic jams to see US single-seater cars racing on a banked oval track {{for the first time}} in Britain were rewarded with a race that fully reflected the present strengths of a branch of motor sport that can trace its roots back to the first running of the Indianapolis 500 race in 1911." [...] The Associated Press stated that despite the race almost being cancelled it became [...] "one of CART's most dramatic of the season." ...|$|E

News {{found the}} video [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "pretty {{stripped}} down", further writing: [...] "There are no catchy choreographed dances or freakum dresses, just Queen Bey looking gorgeous in lingerie and belting out her love and devotion to her man." [...] Cady {{added that the}} video was entertaining because of Beyoncé [...] "seriously magical hair" [...] and her skin, which was sparkling like Edward Cullen. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly concluded that although the video {{was different from the}} previous [...] "heavily produced spectacles" [...] Beyoncé has made, [...] "it's hard <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> eyes off it". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic criticized the sex appeal which was used in the videos for Lady Gaga's [...] "You and I" [...] (2011) and Katy Perry's [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" [...] (2011) but felt that [...] "Beyonce's game is unique in its reliance on pure visual magnetism". He wrote that even when Beyoncé is [...] "inhabiting apocalyptic warzones or Mad Men-era domestic scenes", she is always classical. Kornhaber concluded that the video for [...] "1+1" [...] is [...] "catchy, fun dance, pretty face, pretty body", which according to him, is what [...] "Beyonce [...] always been about". Melinda Newman from the website HitFix found [...] "some lovely kaleidoscopic shots and billowing sheets". She added that [...] "we never see her '+1' other than an arm and back shot, but that works to the video's advantage".|$|E
500|$|Milian {{wrote the}} hip-hop ballad [...] "Gonna Tell Everybody" [...] about [...] "thinking that I had {{something}} good, {{what happens when}} it's over, and going forward with my life." [...] The track {{was one of the}} final songs that Milian wrote about the break-up as it [...] "helped me get it all out". While the record is about a break-up, it focuses more on closure and moving past it. Milian and Cool & Dre used the melody of the Bone Thugs-n-Harmony song [...] "Tha Crossroads" [...] and changed the lyrics [...] "and I'm gonna miss everybody" [...] to [...] "and I'm gonna tell everybody". The other song, [...] "Who's Gonna Ride", has a more street and gangster vibe, and contain more raw lyrics. Milian wrote the track with Dre, which she said helped because hip hop artists write about real things in their lives and are not afraid to say anything. While writing the track, Milian let her guard down and wrote what she was feeling and tried to be real. Lyrically, the song also deals with [...] "the girls that come around and try <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> man. Or the groupie girls that are around, paying attention to the guys on TV that only hang out with them for those reasons." [...] Milian also said [...] "Who's Gonna Ride" [...] was the hardest song to write because it was not safe, unlike previous songs she had written. The singer explained writing the lyrics was not hard, but the difficulty came from being real and actually writing about her true feelings. When writing the lyrics, Milian removed several lines that she thought were too harsh.|$|E

500|$|Unfortunately, {{shortly before}} dawn on May 12, Union forces {{comprising}} three full divisions (Major General Winfield S. Hancock's II Corps) attacked the Mule Shoe through heavy fog, taking the Confederate forces by surprise. Exhaustion, inadequate food, lack of artillery support, and wet powder from the night's rain {{contributed to the}} collapse of the Confederate position as the Union forces swarmed out of the mist, overwhelming Steuart's men and effectively putting an end to the Virginia Brigade. Confederate muskets would not fire due to damp powder, and apart from two remaining artillery pieces, the Southerners were effectively without firearms. During the thick of the fierce hand-to-hand fighting that followed, Steuart was forced to surrender to Colonel James A. Beaver of the 148th Pennsylvania Infantry. Beaver asked Steuart [...] "Where is your sword, sir?", to which the general replied, with considerable sarcasm, [...] "Well, suh, you all waked us up so early this mawnin' that I didn't have time to get it on." [...] Steuart was brought to General Hancock, who had seen Steuart's wife Maria in Washington before the battle and wished to give her news of her husband. He extended his hand, asking [...] "how are you, Steuart?" [...] But Steuart refused to shake Hancock's hand; although the two men had been friends before the war, they were now enemies. Steuart said: [...] "Considering the circumstance, General, I refuse <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> hand", to which Hancock is said to have replied, [...] "And under any other circumstance, General, I would have refused to offer it." [...] After this episode, an offended Hancock then left Steuart to march to the Union rear with the other prisoners.|$|E
500|$|The Dreamcast {{version was}} heavily criticized. Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that [...] "the {{best bet for}} all {{involved}} would be <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> chips elsewhere". Similarly, IGN editor Jeremy Dunham noted that [...] "the blandness of the game's presentation would probably disappoint {{the most basic of}} cavemen. Even the graphics are disappointing. True, those card tables can look very realistic, but what else is there to marvel at? Nothing! Without any type of exploration feature, or other characters there isn't anything to render". Allgame's Bryan Hightower criticized that [...] "there are not enough games, there are annoying wait times, and the help mode is terrible". He also complained that [...] "the dealer deals painfully slow and has to say what cards you have twice. You can already read your hand right on the screen, so you don't need the dealer to waste your time". Hightower also cited that [...] "when you win at slots, the camera always goes {{to the bottom of the}} machine to show you the payout scale" [...] which [...] "becomes frustrating after a few credits because it is so slow. The act of leaving the table or machine is even slower". He also said that the advice the game gives you is [...] "Perhaps the most irritating 'feature' of this game" [...] because [...] "Each time you do something the computer wouldn't have done, a pop-up screen will appear that adds more time to the lengthy procedure of completing a bet". Hightower commented that [...] "The above-par graphics are quickly negated by the rock-bottom enjoyment factor" [...] and that [...] "this game doesn't have any of the character the real casino has".|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps {{compared}} the video {{with the music}} video of [...] "November Rain". The scenes of the dead models were described as stomach turning while he complimented the video for [...] "brimming with cinematic style [...] that it's hard <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> eyes off it, though it will likely be labeled as a little self-indulgent." [...] He also commented on the leaking of the video saying that it [...] "warranted {{more than just a}} simple leak; it deserved a red carpet." [...] Anna Pickard from The Guardian complimented the video saying that [...] "quite a lot of work has gone into it". However, she opined that the video was too long. Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review of the video, saying it [...] "gives us even more of the next-level cuckoo we've come to expect from the girl born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta." [...] The paparazzi theme of the video was compared to Britney Spears's 2004 music video, [...] "Everytime". MTV News called the video a [...] "1940s romantic-epic-style video" [...] that [...] "proves once and for all that Gaga is a true original with a unique vision." [...] The video was nominated for five VMAs at the 2009 awards in the categories of Best Direction, Best Editing, Best Special Effects, Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction. Along with four other nominations for [...] "Poker Face", she and Beyoncé were tied for most nominations that year. The video won the award for Best Art Direction and Best Special Effects. The music video for Gaga's single [...] "Telephone" [...] is a continuation of the [...] "Paparazzi" [...] music video, and is a short film as well. The video picks up right where [...] "Paparazzi" [...] left off; starting with Gaga in prison.|$|E
