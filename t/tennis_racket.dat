For the first 100 years of the modern game, rackets were made of wood and of standard size, and strings were of animal gut. Laminated wood construction yielded more strength in rackets used {{through most of the}} 20th century until first metal and then composites of carbon graphite, ceramics, and lighter metals such as titanium were introduced. These stronger materials enabled the production of oversized rackets that yielded yet more power. Meanwhile, technology led to the use of synthetic strings that match the feel of gut yet with added durability.|$|E
25|$|Women {{moving out}} of the Victorian era and into the Edwardian era were {{starting}} to dress for a more active lifestyle. The evolving times brought a new fashion trend known as the “New Woman”. Active lives required less constricting clothing and required simpler and more streamlined clothing.

The new and improved fashions allowed for women to swing a <b>tennis</b> <b>racket,</b> whack a golf ball, but the ideas of “proper” feminine attire reduced the progress of more practical sportswear.|$|E
