5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E
500|$|The {{second and}} third manifestos, An Open Letter to Sir Nicholas Serota and Remodernism respectively, {{were sent to the}} {{director}} of the Tate, Nicholas Serota. He sent a brief reply: [...] "Thank you for your open letter dated 6March. You will not be surprised to learn <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> comment to make on your letter, or your manifesto 'Remodernism'." ...|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{chooses to}} {{minimize}} the amount of computer-generated imagery for special effects in his films, preferring to use practical effects whenever possible, only using CGI to enhance elements which he has photographed in camera. For instance, his films Batman Begins, Inception and Interstellar featured 620, 500 and 850 visual-effects shots, respectively, which is considered minor when compared with contemporary visual-effects epics which may have upwards of 1,500 to 2,000 VFX shots: [...] "I believe in an absolute difference between animation and photography. However sophisticated your computer-generated imagery is, if it's been created from no physical elements and you haven't shot anything, it's going to feel like animation. There are usually two different goals in a visual effects movie. One is to fool the audience into seeing something seamless, and that's how I try to use it. The other is to impress the audience {{with the amount of}} money spent on the spectacle of the visual effect, and <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> interest in".|$|E

500|$|During {{her teenage}} years, Sevigny became rebellious: [...] "I was very well-mannered, {{and my mother}} was very strict. But I did hang out at the Mobil station and smoke cigarettes." [...] Between her junior and senior year of high school, she shaved her head and sold her hair to a Broadway wigmaker. She openly {{admitted}} to using drugs as a teenager, especially hallucinogens. She has commented that her father was aware of her experimentation with hallucinogens and marijuana, and even told her that it was okay, but that she had [...] "to stop if she had bad trips". Despite her father's leniency, her mother later chose to send her to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In 2007, she told The Times that [...] "I had a great family life [...] I would never want it to look as if it reflected on them. I think I was very bored, and I did just love taking hallucinogens... but I often feel it's because I experimented when I was younger <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> interest as an adult. I know a lot of adults who didn't, and it's much more dangerous when you start experimenting with drugs as an adult." [...] She often described herself as a [...] "loner" [...] and a [...] "depressed teenager". Her only extracurricular activity was occasionally skateboarding with her older brother, and she spent most of her free time in her bedroom: [...] "Mostly I sewed. I had nothing better to do, so I made my own clothes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Abdullah Abdullah accused Hamid Karzai of [...] "stealing" [...] the {{election}} and alleged that widespread electoral fraud had been committed. He told The Guardian: [...] "It was led by Mr Karzai. He knew. He knew that without this he cannot win, about <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> doubt in my mind." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 2009, {{shortly after}} his {{nomination}} as NIH director, Collins stated {{in an interview in}} The New York Times: “I have made it clear <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> religious agenda for the N.I.H., and I think the vast majority of scientists have been reassured by that and have moved on.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Armstrong {{immediately}} replied on his website, saying, [...] "Unfortunately, {{the witch}} hunt continues and tomorrow's article {{is nothing short}} of tabloid journalism. The paper even admits in its own article that the science in question here is faulty and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> way to defend myself. They state: 'There will therefore be no counter-exam nor regulatory prosecutions, in a strict sense, since defendant's rights cannot be respected.' I will simply restate what I have said many times: I have never taken performance enhancing drugs." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 4 June 2013, Heynckes {{announced}} he would not coach a team during the 2013–14 season. On 21 June, {{in an interview with}} Der Spiegel, Heynckes said, [...] "After everything that's happened over the past two years, I'm ready for some peace and quiet. After this string of successes, I could transfer to just about any club in Europe. I {{have a problem with the}} finality of saying 'never'. But I can assure you <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> intention of coaching again. I had a worthy ending." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Roger Ebert {{from the}} Chicago Sun-Times, {{the film was}} met with two extremes, one side being overall positive, while the other side being the exact opposite. Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, who was also in attendance, said in a 1992 interview, [...] "After I saw Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me at Cannes, David Lynch had {{disappeared}} so far up his own ass <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> desire to see another David Lynch movie until I hear something different. And you know, I loved him. I loved him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In two {{separate}} interviews in 2012, MC Kinky said [...] "Shows like X Factor and Britain's Got Talent reduce {{the art of}} making music and practising your craft {{to the level of}} a low rent game show with huge financial backing and support. It's a means to make money, not a means to produce ground breaking or interesting artists that demonstrate what they are feeling or are compelled to do. It's corporate" [...] and [...] "it's a churn 'em out fast food form of putrid shit <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> affiliation with".|$|E
2500|$|Khan has a {{reputation}} for avoiding award ceremonies and not accepting any popular Indian film awards. Though nominated many times, Khan has not attended any Indian film award ceremonies and has stated that [...] "Indian film awards lack credibility". When asked about the selection procedure and authenticity of popular Indian film awards, Aamir Khan said, [...] "Fact is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> objections to film awards per se. I just feel that if I don't value a particular film award, then I won't attend it either. Apart from the National Film Awards, I don't see any other award ceremony that I should give value to. My personal experience about these award ceremonies is that I don't trust them. I have no faith in them so I would prefer to stay away." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Guinness {{disliked the}} fame that {{followed}} work {{he did not}} hold in high esteem, Lucas and fellow cast members Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Kenny Baker, Anthony Daniels and Carrie Fisher have spoken highly of his courtesy and professionalism, {{on and off the}} set. Lucas credited him with inspiring cast and crew to work harder, saying that Guinness contributed significantly to achieving completion of the filming. Guinness was quoted as saying that the royalties he obtained from working on the films gave him [...] "no complaints; let me leave it by saying I can live {{for the rest of my}} life in the reasonably modest way I am now used to, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> debts and I can afford to refuse work that doesn't appeal to me." [...] In his autobiography, Blessings In Disguise, Guinness tells an imaginary interviewer [...] "Blessed be Star Wars", regarding the income it provided.|$|E
2500|$|Shōichi Nakagawa died on 4 October 2009, aged 56 at {{his home}} in Tokyo. Japanese media reports said his body was found face down on the bed by his wife, with no {{external}} injuries. She alerted ambulance services at approximately 8:30 am. His death had taken place at least eight hours previously. An investigation was done to determine the cause of death. An autopsy was planned to determine the cause of death. A will has not been located. Taro Aso, the former Japanese Prime Minister, was rendered speechless by the news: [...] "I am so deeply shocked <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> words." [...] Hirohisa Fujii, his successor as Finance Minister, also commented: [...] "I want to express my heartfelt condolences. He was doing a fine job as a finance minister, so it is regrettable." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald said his death had [...] "sent a shock wave throughout the nation." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{president}} wanted {{what he felt}} was an experienced jurist who could appeal to liberals in the party as well as law-and-order conservatives, noting privately that Warren [...] "represents the kind of political, economic, and social thinking that I believe we need on the Supreme Court.... He has a national name for integrity, uprightness, and courage that, again, I believe we need on the Court". In the next few years, Warren led the Court {{in a series of}} liberal decisions that revolutionized the role of the Court. Some writers believe that Eisenhower once remarked that his appointment was [...] "the biggest damn fool mistake I ever made". However, Eisenhower biographer Jean Edward Smith concluded in 2012 that [...] "Eisenhower never said <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> evidence that he ever made such a statement." [...] Eisenhower gave Warren a recess appointment that began on October 1, 1953. It was made permanent when the Senate acted on March 1, 1954. No serious opposition had appeared and he was confirmed by unanimous voice vote.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} May, Darwin's health {{had failed}} again, but after a week's {{hydrotherapy}} {{he was able to}} start correcting the proofs. He struggled on despite rarely being able to write free of stomach pains for more than twenty minutes at a stretch, and made drastic revisions which left Murray with a huge £72 bill for corrections. Murray upped the print run to 1,250 copies, with a publication date in November. A copy was sent to Lyell, with a [...] "foolishly anxious" [...] Darwin hoping that he would [...] "come round". An eager Lyell gave Darwin [...] "very great kudos", though he was still concerned that [...] "the dignity of man is at stake". One of Lyell's relatives commented that it was [...] "sure to be very curious and important... however mortifying it may be to think that our remote ancestors were jelly fishes". Darwin was [...] "sorry to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> 'consolatory view' on the dignity of man. I am content that man will probably advance, and care not much whether we are looked at as mere savages in a remotely distant future." ...|$|E
2500|$|Articles {{published}} at {{that time}} hinted Faithfull was looking to retirement, in hopes money from Songs of the Innocence and Experience would enable her to live in comfort. She said: [...] "I’m not prepared to be 70 and absolutely broke. I realised last year <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> safety net at all and I’m {{going to have to}} get one. So I need to change my attitude to life, which means I have to put away 10 per cent every year of my old age. I want to be in a position where I don’t have to work. I should have thought about this a long time ago but I didn’t." [...] However, she still lived in her flat in Paris (located in one of the most expensive streets of the capital) and had a house in County Waterford, Ireland. Recording of Easy Come, Easy Go commenced in New York City on 6 December 2007; the album was produced by Hal Willner who had previously recorded Strange Weather in 1997. A version of Morrissey's [...] "Dear God Please Help Me" [...] from his 2006 album, Ringleader of the Tormentors is one of the songs featured. In March 2009, she performed [...] "The Crane Wife 3" [...] on The Late Show. In late March, she began the Easy Come, Easy Go tour, which took her to France, Germany, Austria, New York City, Los Angeles and London.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Hart {{states in}} Hitman, that while conversing with Michaels: [...] "I added, 'I also {{want you to}} know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> problem {{dropping}} the belt to you if that's what Vince wants.' He glared back at me. 'I appreciate that, but I {{want you to know}} that I'm not willing to do the same for you.' And then he left. Jim [...] snorted, 'I can't believe that he just said that.' There was no way I could ever drop the belt to him now: he'd just shown complete disrespect not only to me, but to the position of champion..." [...] This exchange is confirmed in Dave Meltzer's account: [...] "During the meeting, Hart told Michaels that he'd be happy to put him over at the end of the run, but Michaels told Hart flat-out that he wouldn't return the favor. Michaels and Hart spoke again on the subject on 10/12 in San Jose, when once again Michaels told Hart that he wasn't going to do a job for him." [...] Additionally, in Forgiven Vince Russo stated, [...] "Well - no surprise here - Bret refused to do the job (get pinned) for Shawn in Canada. Not because he was being unprofessional - but because according to Bret, Michaels had said that he wouldn't do business with him (the right thing for the company in the ring), due to the way he felt about him." ...|$|E
