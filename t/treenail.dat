5000|$|A <b>treenail,</b> also trenail, trennel, or trunnel, is {{a wooden}} peg, pin, or dowel used to fasten {{pieces of wood}} together, {{especially}} in timber frames, covered bridges, wooden shipbuilding and boat building. Many such buildings and bridges are still in use. [...] Locust is a favorite wood when making trunnels in shipbuilding due to its strength and rot resistance and red oak is typical in buildings.|$|E
5000|$|In {{woodworking}} and construction, a nail is a pin-shaped {{object of}} metal (or wood, called a <b>treenail</b> or [...] "trunnel") {{which is used}} as a fastener, as a peg to hang something, or sometimes as a decoration. Generally, nails have a sharp point on one end and a flattened head on the other, but headless nails are available. Nails are made in a great variety of forms for specialized purposes. The most common is a wire nail. Other types of nails include pins, tacks, s, and cleats.|$|E

The top bay {{was used by the}} wheelwrights, who constructed and repaired the wheels on the dockyard carts, and may have made ships' wheels. The middle bay was used by the pumpmakers and the coak and <b>treenail</b> makers. Pumps were simple affairs, made of wood with iron and leather fittings. Coaks were the bearings in pulley blocks, and treenails were the long oak pins, made on a lathe, or moot that were used to pin the planking to the frames. The west bay was used by the capstan makers, capstans were used to raise the anchor.|$|E
50|$|The <b>treenailed</b> boat is a boat {{model used}} in Northern Europe, usually {{associated}} with Vikings but should perhaps be ascribed to Pomeranian groups. The shape and construction coincides with the sewn boats, but instead of ropes, it is assembled with wooden <b>treenails.</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{construction}} and use of compressed <b>treenails</b> in a waterwheel construction. The method of compressing <b>treenails</b> {{is no longer in}} use, although it is being said to have a constructive advantage. When the compressed <b>treenails</b> are being exposed to water they expand in the construction, which results in a tighter and stronger joint. The experimental part of the study accounts for the production and the attachment of compressed <b>treenails.</b> The methods are based upon the descriptions found in Afhandlingen rörande Mechaniquen (Rinman 1794). Experiments are also carried out on how much and why the expansion occurs. In the results the author presents some of the experiences of the relations between techniques and material that were used in the experiments. Finally the results are being discussed according to their suitability in waterwheel constructions. Uppsats för avläggande av filosofie kandidatexamen i Kulturvård, Bygghantverk, 22, 5 hp, 201...|$|R

5000|$|The Beden, badan, or {{alternate}} type names Beden-seyed and Beden-safar, is a fast, ancient Somali {{single or}} double-masted maritime vessel and ship, typified by its towering stern-post and powerful rudder. It {{is also the}} longest surviving sewn boat in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Its shipyards predominantly lie in the northeastern Hafun region of Somalia (notably Bayla), as well as Muscat. There are 2 types of Beden ships, with one type geared towards fishing (the Beden-seyed) and the other, trading (Beden-safar). The average trading Beden-safar ship measure more than 15 m (49 ft) in length, and are significantly larger than the fishing Beden-seyed ships, which measure 6-15m (20-49 ft) on average, but both are dwarfed by a much larger trading variant called the uwassiye, he most common trading and voyaging ship, with some measuring up to 77+ ft. The ship is noticeable and unique in its strengthened substantial gunwale, which attached by <b>treenail</b> [...] Originally, all Beden ships were sewn with coiled coconut fibre, holding the hull planking, stem and stern-post. but Omani variants, beginning in the 20th century, began nailing instead of sewing the planks.|$|E
5000|$|Ancient {{shipbuilding}} used <b>treenails</b> to {{bind the}} boat together. They {{had the advantage}} of not giving rise to [...] "nail-sickness", a term for decay accelerated and concentrated around metal fasteners. Increased water content causes wood to expand, so that <b>treenails</b> gripped the planks tighter as they absorbed water. Similar wooden trenail fastenings were used as alternatives to metal spikes to secure railroad rail-support [...] "chairs" [...] to wooden sleepers (ties) in early Victorian times.|$|R

50|$|While wooden pegs (often called <b>treenails)</b> {{can be used}} {{to fasten}} thicker clinker planks, this {{technique}} only works if the planks are thick enough to hold the pegs. Because of this, large ships were often built using pegs, while smaller boats would use sewn planks.|$|R
50|$|Where {{suitable}} metal was not available, it {{was possible}} to use <b>treenails</b> (pronounced trennels). They were like clench bolts but made of wood, and instead of being clenched, they had a hardwood wedge knocked into each end to spread it. The surplus was then sawn off.|$|R

50|$|Honey locusts {{produce a}} high quality, durable wood that polishes well, but the tree does not grow in {{sufficient}} numbers {{to support a}} bulk industry; however, a niche market exists for honey locust furniture. It is also used for posts and rails since {{it takes a long}} time to rot. In the past, the hard thorns of the younger trees were used as nails while the wood itself was used to fashion <b>treenails</b> for shipbuilding.|$|R
50|$|As {{the planks}} reached the desired height, the {{interior}} frame (futtocks) and cross beams were added. Frames were placed close together, {{which is an}} enduring feature of thin planked ships, still used today on some lightweight wooden racing craft such as those designed by Bruce Farr. Viking boat builders used a spacing of about 850 mm. Part {{of the reason for}} this spacing was to achieve the correct distance between rowing stations and to create space for the chests used by Norse sailors as thwarts (seats). The bottom futtocks next to the keel were made from natural L-shaped crooks. The upper futtocks were usually not attached to the lower futtocks to allow some hull twist. The parts were held together with iron rivets, hammered in from the outside of the hull and fastened from the inside with a rove (washers). The surplus rivet was then cut off. A ship normally used about 700 kg of iron nails in a 18 m long ship. In some ships the gap between the lower uneven futtock and the lapstrake planks was filled with a spacer block about 200 mm long. In later ships spruce stringers were fastened lengthwise to the futtocks roughly parallel to the keel. Longships had about five rivets for each yard (90 cm) of plank. In many early ships <b>treenails</b> (trenails, trunnels) were used to fasten large timbers. First, a hole about 20 mm wide hole was drilled through two adjoining timbers, a wooden pegs inserted which was split and a thin wedge inserted to expand the peg. Some <b>treenails</b> have been found with traces of linseed oil suggesting that <b>treenails</b> were soaked before the pegs were inserted. When dried the oil would act as a semi-waterproof weak filler/glue.|$|R

50|$|Although well established, the sewn boat name is {{somewhat}} misleading since it suggests textile or leather skin construction, as {{often found in}} kayaks. Some have proposed to use laced boats (Ge. geschnürte Boote) instead. A modern plywood construction method that resembles sewn boats is the stitch and glue method; in this technique plywood panels are stitched together, often with wire, and the seams are reinforced with fiberglass composite; the stitching may then be removed or may remain in place. Also related is the <b>treenailed</b> boat.|$|R
50|$|Egypt's {{expanding}} {{interests in}} trade goods such as ebony, incense such as myrrh and frankincense, gold, copper and other useful metals inspired the ancient Egyptians to build suitable ships for navigation {{of the open}} sea. They traded with Lebanon for cedar and travelled {{the length of the}} Red Sea to the Kingdom of Punt—possibly modern day Somalia—for ebony, ivory and aromatic resins. Ship builders of that era did not use pegs (<b>treenails)</b> or metal fasteners, but relied on rope to keep their ships assembled. Planks and the superstructure were tightly tied and bound together.|$|R
