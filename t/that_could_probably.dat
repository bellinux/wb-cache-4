40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} factors influencing attitude towards knowledge sharing (KS). KS is an organized attempt to accelerate sharing {{of knowledge and}} experiences, in any format, among individuals or groups. However, in many situations, people in organizations avoid sharing their knowledge. Prior studies show that existing knowledge in organizations is not being effectively shared. This is mainly because of insufficient understanding of factors influencing attitudes towards KS among individuals. According to theses studies, the lack of motivation for sharing knowledge is the main factor <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>probably</b> impede KS intention. As there are some limitations in the existing research in this field, in this study the Theory of Reasoned Action, Social Exchange Theory and Flow Theory were mainly {{used to make a}} theoretical model {{to investigate}} factors influencing intentions towards KS...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION John Trono {{published}} a new exercise in concurrent programming [12] {{with the aim}} of providing educators with a more challenging problem than simple mutual exclusion: a problem with three distinct process types. His solution is rather complex, using ten semaphores and two global variables. Unfortunately, his solution is incorrect under the usual semantics of concurrent programming which require that a program be correct in any interleaving of the primitive statements of the processes [2]. Once a process has executed a semaphore instruction (either P or Q, there is nothing that requires that the process be scheduled for execution. Thus it is di#cult to get a group of processes to execute "together", which is the behavior required by the problem specification. There are semaphore algorithms <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>probably</b> be adapted to solve the problem [9], but these are extremely complex and not suitable for introductory courses in conc...|$|E
40|$|As {{with many}} life events, divorce {{is a subject}} for {{discussion}} and debate involving {{a broad range of}} disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Economics is not generally at the forefront of these disciplines; it is lawyers and psychologists who are first in line to accompany conjugal trajectories. Demographers are also widely called upon to examine changes and variations in the phenomenon, providing the necessary basis for formulating possible interpretations of the reasons for these changes, which occur in time, space and, naturally, the social space. Sociologists and economists are part of this second circle of experts interested in the causes and, above all, the consequences of divorce. The article by Cécile Bourreau-Dubois and Myriam Doriat-Duban is unquestionably a useful contribution in this respect. It provides a basis for an actuarial analysis aimed at judging the nature of this " risk " and envisaging the grounds and methods for covering it.

40|$|Human/process {{error is}} {{potentially}} a large contributor to failures of aerospace systems. For some systems, {{such as the}} space shuttle main engine, large amounts of data are available, and accurate failure rates can be determined empirically. For such systems, the human error is implicit in the empirical failure rate and {{does not need to}} be quantified separately. However, for other systems, such as the solid rocket boosters, large amounts of data are not available and the failure rates must be determined by more theoretical means. When empirical data is lacking, structural models and engineering judgment must be employed. In this case, the human/process error must be modeled explicitly. An extensive literature review was performed to determine what methods already exist for modeling human error for aerospace systems. No methods that apply directly were found, although there are a number of methods that have been developed specifically for the nuclear power industry <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>probably</b> be modified for space applications. The results of the literature review are presented, as well as recommendations for future research...|$|E
40|$|Eutypine (4 -hydroxy- 3 -[3 -methyl- 3 -butene- 1 -ynyl] benzaldehyde) is a toxin {{produced}} by Eutypa lata, the causal agent of eutypa dieback in the grapevine (Vitis vinifera). Eutypine is enzymatically converted by numerous plant tissues into eutypinol (4 -hydroxy- 3 - [3 -methyl- 3 -butene- 1 -ynyl] benzyl alcohol), a metabolite that is nontoxic to grapevine. We report a four-step procedure for the purification to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity of a eutypinereducing enzyme (ERE) from etiolated mung bean (Vigna radiata) hypocotyls. The purified protein is a monomer of 36 kD, uses NADPH as a cofactor, and exhibits a Km value of 6. 3 mM for eutypine {{and a high}} affinity for 3 - and 4 -nitro-benzaldehyde. The enzyme failed to catalyze the reverse reaction using eutypinol as a substrate. ERE detoxifies eutypine efficiently over a pH range from 6. 2 to 7. 5. These data strongly suggest that ERE is an aldehyde reductase <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>probably</b> be classified into the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. We discuss the possible role of this enzyme in eutypine detoxification...|$|E
30|$|Fatalities <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>probably</b> {{have been}} {{prevented}} by eCall typically included the following types of injuries: Firstly hypoxia, frequently caused by drowning. There were cases in which a vehicle had overturned in shallow water or had driven directly into water and passengers {{were not able to}} exit the vehicle. Secondly, there were cases involving alcoholic abuse in which an occupant died because the passengers (with or without trauma) were so drunk that they were asleep or unable to recognise the gravity of the situation. Thirdly, sometimes there was no trauma that would have caused death, had help been available within a reasonable time. These cases included fractures to the ribs with slowly proceeding haematoma, and mild initial brain contusions in combination with breathing difficulties, leading to severe brain oedema. Many of the deceased people had had mild heart ischemia or non-traumatic brain bleeding or another severe disease. Finally, there were severe medical attacks in rural areas. It was assessed that in those accidents the occupant could have used a manual emergency button at the first onset of symptoms. In all cases, only those with close enough and realistic treatment resources were included.|$|E
