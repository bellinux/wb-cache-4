5000|$|In 1964, Kesler called Zelman Levine, the CEO and President of Lakeside Toys for a meeting. They met in November of {{that year}} at the Essex House New York City. Also present were Lakeside's vice president, James R. Becker, who would {{eventually}} become president, and Stanley Harfenist, Lakeside’s future General Manager {{who was in the}} process of bringing Gumby to Lakeside. Kesler walked into Levine’s room, dropped the monkeys on the table, and began to link them together. Becker said the phrase, “more fun than a barrel of monkeys” was brought up at that meeting by Becker himself. Levine immediately approved the toy and took all the samples back with him to his headquarters in Minneapolis. Barrel of Monkeys was quickly released in 1965 as a Lakeside toy allowing Marks, Dinhofer and Kesler to receive ongoing royalties. Barrel of Monkeys initially came in a cardboard tube with a plastic monkey attached to the lid. This <b>tube</b> <b>packaging</b> was similar to Lakeside’s already successful Pick-Up-Sticks, [...] In April 1967, Barrel of Monkeys in a plastic barrel was #2 on Toy and Hobby World’s Toy Hit Parade chart.|$|E

50|$|Which {{ingredients}} are chosen also relies {{on how the}} mascara is manufactured. Today, {{there are two main}} methods of production. The first is referred to as anhydrous. In this method all waxes, oils, and pigments are mixed, heated, and agitated simultaneously in formulated ratios. The result is a semi-solid substance that is ready to be placed in <b>tubes,</b> <b>packaged,</b> shipped and sold. The other method used is termed emulsion. The emulsion method also results in a semi-solid substance, but its procedure greatly differs. In the emulsion method, water and thickeners are first combined. Separately, waxes and emulsifiers are mixed and heated. Pigment is then added individually to both mixtures. Finally all is combined in a homogenizer, which acts as a high-speed agitator in order to thoroughly mix the oils, water, waxes, and emulsifiers—ingredients that naturally repulse each other.|$|R

25|$|High-power tubes such as {{transmitting}} <b>tubes</b> have <b>packages</b> designed more {{to enhance}} heat transfer. In some tubes, the metal envelope {{is also the}} anode. The 4CX1000A is an external anode tube of this sort. Air is blown through an array of fins attached to the anode, thus cooling it. Power tubes using this cooling scheme are available up to 150kW dissipation. Above that level, water or water-vapor cooling are used. The highest-power tube currently available is the Eimac , a forced water-cooled power tetrode capable of dissipating 2.5 megawatts. By comparison, the largest power transistor can only dissipate about 1 kilowatt.|$|R
5000|$|The design goal {{of these}} hybrid micro heads {{was to provide}} usable power from a compact digital power amp section {{combined}} with a real analog preamplifier {{in a very small}} and light metal chassis. The amps each weigh about 1.1 lbs, and fit in one hand (Dimensions (W x D x H): 135mm x 100mm x 75mm/5.31” x 3.94” x 2.95”). These amps are advertised as 50 watt heads, so the power section is a special Class D design as might be expected. What is unexpected is the preamp design that includes a new type of vacuum tube (valve) called the Nutube 6P1, which is the result of Korg working with Japanese vacuum fluorescent display (VFD) company Noritake Itron Corp.(Ise Electronics Corp). As such, the Nutube is a dual-triode vacuum <b>tube</b> <b>packaged</b> similarly to a VFD [...] "chip" [...] which makes it mountable on a circuit board using holes and pads not unlike a DIP. The miniaturized flat package topography, low power consumption, and low heat, long life attributes of the Nutube are key contributors to deploying an analog tube preamp in such a small, lightweight footprint. Power consumption is only 3.43 Amps which is provided by a DC19VAC adapter, but Vox rates the MV50 power output rated at 50 Watts. However, note the 50W rating is for a 4Ω load; power output specs are as follows: Max 50W RMS at 4 Ohms, 25W RMS at 8 Ohms, 12.5W RMS at 16 Ohms.|$|R

30|$|In {{engineering}} applications, {{there are}} various types of boilers such as water tube boilers, fire <b>tube</b> boilers, <b>packaged</b> boiler, fluidized bed combustion boiler, pulverized fuel boiler and waste heat boilers. These boilers are used in different industries such as power plants, paper, and chemical. The present paper reports various problems (such as agglomeration, slagging, fouling, caustic embrittlement, fatigue failure and high temperature corrosion) related to boilers and their possible solutions. Some of the controlling parameters for high temperature corrosion has also been studied viz use of inhibitors, varying temperature and pressure, sol–gel coating and thermal spray coating. Thermal spraying {{has emerged as a}} main tool for improvement in surface. Problem of corrosion, wear resistance, electrical or thermal insulation can be altered using different coating techniques and materials. Deposition of ash in biomass-fired boilers also causes severe problems of agglomeration. The problem of agglomeration can be solved using kaolin or NH 3 in the bed of boilers. Some important processes such as pulse detonation wave technology, intelligent soot blower, chemical treatment technology can be used to minimize the effects of fouling.|$|R
50|$|The A-type package boiler has two water {{drums and}} one steam drum {{compared}} to the D-type package boiler. Water boils off in the water drums shared by a common header, then sent up the generating tubes, into the steam drum and up the dry pipe.

A-type package boilers were designed to improve package boiler reliability and reduce <b>tube</b> replacements. A-type <b>package</b> boilers are smaller than D-type therefore will fit smaller plants, but {{does not have the}} same power output as D-type package boilers.|$|R
40|$|The Silicon Photomultiplier (SIPM) {{is a novel}} photon sensing device, with {{potential}} applications in particle physics, astronomy and general gamma-ray spectroscopy. Various SiPM designs were evaluated for these roles by coupling them {{to a range of}} scintillators, including LSO, NaI(Tl) and CsI(Tl). It was found that a LSO-SiPM gamma-ray detector provide sufficiently good energy resolution (11 % at 511 keV) in a very compact package to be of interest in PET imaging. SiPMs awere also found to provide competitive spectra to PIN diodes of comparable area (1 cm 2) when coupled to CsI(Tl), raising interest in gamma-ray astronomy where a CsI(Tl) -SiPM detector could be used as an imaging element. Good performance with CsI(Tl) encouraged investigation of SiPMs in the gamma-ray spectroscopy role, specifically radioisotope identification with portable instruments. The ScintiSphere concept was exploited to allow a larger, more sensitive detector to be built using SiPMs without sacrificing spectral quality. An 8 cc sphere of CsI(Tl) coupled to a 1 cm 2 SiPM array was found to give a noise floor of 35 keV and a resolution of 9 % at 662 keV, closely comparable to a 0. 8 cc square crystal, despite the factor of 10 improvement in sensitive volume. Neutron detection with a SiPM array is achieved using LiI(Eu), which was found to resolve thermal neutron captures to 12 % FWHM and achieve excellent gamma-ray rejection. In this application, SiPMs are preferable to PIN diodes as they are immune to direct gamma-ray interactions which could degrade gamma-ray rejection. When packaged in a compact moderator of 15 mm depth and volume 58 cc of HDPE, a compact neutron counter was built and found to be slightly more efficient than a 3 ” He 3 <b>tube</b> <b>packaged</b> in 16 mm of HDPE. Finally, an instrument is proposed that exploits the intrinsic advantages of SiPMs. The use of SiPMs with LaBr(Ce) is explored and simulations are carried out of a directional spectrometer, predicted to locate a Cs 137 source of 1 mC at 2 m to within 15 ° in 15 seconds. In conclusion, it is found that SiPMs should be of great interest in these fields due to providing comparable performance to existing systems whilst providing additional benefits such as low power electronics, high gain and immunity to direct X-ray interactions.
