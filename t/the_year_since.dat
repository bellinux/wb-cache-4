It ended on the first Sunday four times (1952, 1957, 1958, 1959) and the 1979 and 1984 tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday. The first edition in 1934 was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the 1942 event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time in draft history the first three draft picks were all freshmen. The Chicago Bulls used the first overall pick to draft Chicago native Derrick Rose from the University of Memphis, who later {{went on to win the}} NBA Rookie of the Year Award, making him the first player to be drafted first overall and to win Rookie of <b>the</b> <b>Year</b> <b>since</b> LeBron James in 2003. The Miami Heat used the second pick to draft Michael Beasley from Kansas State University, and the Minnesota Timberwolves used the third pick to draft O. J. Mayo from University of Southern California. With five players taken in the draft, the University of Kansas tied University of Connecticut (2006) and University of Florida (2007) for the record with the most players {{selected}} in the first two rounds of an NBA draft. Another record was set when twelve freshmen were drafted, ten of whom were drafted in the first round. Of the players drafted, 29 are forwards, 19 are guards, and 12 are centers.|$|E

30|$|We find {{evidence}} of a positive impact of parents’ <b>years</b> <b>since</b> migration on children’s academic achievement. Our results suggest that <b>the</b> mother’s <b>years</b> <b>since</b> migration are generally most important for grades in Danish and mainly for boys, while <b>the</b> father’s <b>years</b> <b>since</b> migration are most important for grades in math and for drop-out and no exam. The effect of <b>the</b> mother’s <b>years</b> <b>since</b> migration persists no matter whether she is employed or not, while {{the effect of the}} father disappears if he is not employed. This pattern of results may indicate that <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> migration of <b>the</b> mother matters because she better supports Danish language acquisition when she has resided in the country for many <b>years,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> migration of <b>the</b> father matters because he better supports the importance of education for succeeding in the Danish labour market. These results emphasize the importance of our distinction between each parent’s <b>years</b> <b>since</b> migration, which contrasts the approach taken in the earlier literature.|$|R

5|$|On 12 July 2008, Behan was {{questioned}} by the Carabinieri (Italian military police) {{in connection with the}} murder of a 72-year-old woman, Silvana Abate Francescatti, at her home on Monte Amiata, Arcidosso, in Grosseto, Tuscany, Italy. The woman was found on 11 July with 13 stab wounds, including a fatal throat wound, but was believed to have died the previous day. Behan, who had been resident in Arcidosso for part of <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>since</b> 2006, was arrested after seeking treatment twice at a hospital near Arcidosso for a cut on his thigh. In an interview with The Irish Times, he claimed he had first gone to the hospital on 10 July after cutting himself in the thigh while unpacking furniture and other objects delivered from the USA. However, hospital staff had mistakenly decided he had been acting suspiciously due to his poor spoken Italian, {{and the fact that he}} had expressed annoyance at how the hospital was managed and its bad signage.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions had in <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>since</b> {{publication}} received {{highly critical}} replies from state legislatures. Seven states formally responded to Virginia and Kentucky by rejecting the Resolutions {{and three other}} states passed resolutions expressing disapproval, with the other four states taking no action. No other state endorsed the Resolutions. The reason for the criticism was that the General Assembly, led in the effort by state-sovereignty advocate John Taylor of Caroline, had put a state-sovereignty spin on the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 despite Madison's hopes. These replies contended that the Supreme Court of the United States had the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether federal laws were constitutional, and that the Alien and Sedition Acts were constitutional and necessary. The Federalists accused the Democratic-Republicans of seeking disunion, even contemplating violence. At the time, some leading Virginia Democratic-Republican figures such as Rep. William Branch Giles (in public) and Taylor (in private) actually were contemplating disunion, and the Virginia General Assembly chose this juncture for finally constructing a new state armory in Richmond, so there was some truth to the charge.|$|E
5|$|The {{award was}} first {{presented}} as a tie between Michel Camilo and Tomatito for Spain and Paquito D'Rivera for Tropicana Nights. D'Rivera holds the record for most wins as performer in this category, with six (including one awarded as the Paquito D'Rivera Quintet) out of eight nominations. Bebo Valdés won the award twice for albums which also earned the Grammy Award: Bebo de Cuba received the Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album accolade in 2005, while Juntos Para Siempre, by Bebo and Chucho Valdés won for Latin Jazz Album in 2010. Bebo and Chucho Valdés, Camilo, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, and Arturo Sandoval have twice been awarded. In 2012, the award was given to Sandoval for the album Dear Diz (Every Day I Think of You), which was also nominated for Album of <b>the</b> <b>Year.</b> <b>Since</b> its inception, the award has been presented to musicians or ensembles originating from Brazil, Cuba, Dominican Republic, United States, and Spain.|$|E

5|$|The palace, like Windsor Castle, {{is owned}} by the reigning monarch in right of the Crown. It is not the monarch's {{personal}} property, unlike Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle. Many of the contents from Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Kensington Palace, and StJames's Palace are part of the Royal Collection, held in trust by the Sovereign; they can, on occasion, be viewed by the public at the Queen's Gallery, near the Royal Mews. Unlike the palace and the castle, the purpose-built gallery is open continually and displays a changing selection of items from the collection. It occupies the site of the chapel destroyed by an air raid in World WarII. The palace's state rooms have been open to the public during August and September and on selected dates throughout <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>since</b> 1993. The money raised in entry fees was originally put towards the rebuilding of Windsor Castle after the 1992 fire devastated many of its state rooms. In the year to 31 March 2016, 519,000 people visited the palace, and 194,000 visited the gallery.|$|E
5|$|Benavidez Elementary School, {{which opened}} on Tuesday January 21, 1992, {{relieved}} Cunningham of around 675 students and 29 teachers. Benavidez, {{along with two}} other schools, {{was a part of}} a $370 million Houston ISD school construction project, which originated from a school bond approved in March 1989. Rose Garza, the principal of Benavidez, said that the committee determining the name of the school named it after Roy P. Benavidez, a soldier in the Vietnam War who was given the Medal of Honor, because the school wanted to name the school after a Hispanic who could serve as a positive role model to the mostly Hispanic student body that occupied the school when it opened. HISD officials said that the district had little difficulty opening the three schools in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> <b>since</b> the same teachers had been teaching the same students while they occupied the previously overcrowded schools in the preceding fall. On its opening day Benavidez referred 400 students to other schools due to overcrowding. After Benavidez opened, Benavidez and Cunningham each had about 700 students. In 1994, Benavidez had 1,065 pupils and it had to send 200 children to different schools. As of that year, 88% of Benavidez's children were Hispanic. By 1996, both Cunningham and Benavidez became overcrowded. Gordon also became a reliever school for Benavidez and another non-Gulfton school. SER-Niños opened in 1996. In 2000 Benavidez had 1,300 students and Cunningham had 1,190 students. At the schools, the average classroom size was 30 students, exceeding the state's recommendation of 22 students per classroom.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds Are Forever was {{published}} on 26 March 1956 by Jonathan Cape {{with a cover}} designed by Pat Marriott. As with the three previous Bond books, {{the first edition of}} 12,500 copies sold out quickly; the US edition {{was published}} in October 1956 by Macmillan. The novel was serialised in The Daily Express newspaper from 12 April 1956 onwards—the first of Fleming's novels he had sold to the newspaper—which led to an overall rise in the sales of the novels. From November 1956 sales of Diamonds Are Forever, and Fleming's other novels, all rose following the visit of the Prime Minister, Sir Anthony Eden, to Fleming's Goldeneye estate to recuperate following the Suez Crisis; Eden's stay was much reported in the British press. The book received boosts in sales in 1962 when Eon Productions adapted Dr. No for the cinema, and in 1971 when Diamonds Are Forever was produced for the big screen. In February 1958 Pan Books published a paperback version of the novel in the UK, which sold 68,000 copies before the end of <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> <b>Since</b> its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.|$|E

The MTA is planning to implement Bus Rapid Transit on the North Shore, while a study is underway to determine whether light rail should be implemented on Staten Island's west shore. The line has a route bullet similar to other subway routes: the letters SIR in a blue circle. It is used on timetables, on the MTA's site, and on some signage, but not on trains. The line runs 24 hours a day every day of <b>the</b> <b>year</b> (<b>since</b> May 10, 2015, the overnight service is on a 30-minute headway) and is one of only six mass-transit rail lines in the United States to do so (the others being the PATCO Speedline, the Red and Blue Lines of the Chicago 'L', the Green Line of the Minneapolis-St. Paul METRO, the PATH lines, and the New York City Subway).|$|E

25|$|Hyperbolas {{may be seen}} in many sundials. On {{any given}} day, the sun {{revolves}} in a circle on the celestial sphere, and its rays striking the point on a sundial traces out a cone of light. The intersection of this cone with the horizontal plane of the ground forms a conic section. At most populated latitudes and at most times of the year, this conic section is a hyperbola. In practical terms, the shadow of the tip of a pole traces out a hyperbola on the ground {{over the course of a}} day (this path is called the declination line). The shape of this hyperbola varies with the geographical latitude and with the time of <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> <b>since</b> those factors affect the cone of the sun's rays relative to the horizon. The collection of such hyperbolas for a whole year at a given location was called a pelekinon by the Greeks, since it resembles a double-bladed axe.|$|E
