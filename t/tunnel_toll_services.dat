If the free and <b>toll</b> <b>services</b> are both used in equilibrium, a larger free-service capacity implies longer expected waiting time for the free service and lower welfare: an analogue to the Downs-Thomson paradox in transportation economics.

2500|$|In Cobble Hill, {{the route}} {{could go in}} one of three directions. It could {{continue}} to the west end of Atlantic Avenue and then southward down Columbia Street, serving the Columbia Street Waterfront District; serve the residential section of Cobble Hill via Henry, Congress, and Columbia Streets; or turn down Hicks Street. The two Columbia Street options would need to go around the Brooklyn–Battery <b>Tunnel</b> <b>toll</b> plaza, while the Hicks Street option would use Sackett and Union Streets to use Van Brunt and Richards Streets, thus bypassing this detour. South of the Brooklyn–Battery <b>Tunnel</b> <b>toll</b> plaza, the Van Brunt/Richards Streets option would travel down to the streets' south end to Beard Street and turn eastward there, while the Columbia Street option could go down to either Mill or Bay Streets, then travel eastward at one of these two streets. The Mill Street option would go across the Gowanus Canal using 10th Street, while the Bay Street option further south could either use the existing 10th Street bridge or a new 19th Street bridge to cross the canal.|$|R
