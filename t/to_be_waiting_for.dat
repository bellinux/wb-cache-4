Within the Allgemeine-SS, Heydrich forged relationships {{with some of the}} more powerful SS and Police Leaders such as Friedrich Jeckeln. Heydrich maintained a dialogue with him, but cautiously, especially after Jeckeln ran afoul of Himmler in the late 1930s and early 1940s.|$|E

Bettman later explained that the NHL's new divisional alignment precluded the adding of more franchises in the Eastern Time Zone {{at least for the time}} being. As of 2017, Bettman is widely believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> a viable franchise proposal to emerge from Seattle or some other market outside the Eastern Time Zone to balance the divisions, although the commissioner has insisted that further expansion is not on the League's short-term agenda.|$|E

25|$|On April 24, 2011, Pozos and {{a friend}} named Adrian López Reyes were arrested after getting into a fight with two police officers, which {{resulted}} {{in one of the}} officers suffering a fractured skull, the other a broken nose and a whiplash and López getting shot in the foot by a third officer. Pozos was originally denied bail and was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> his trial in jail, facing a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for charges of aggravated assault and attacking authority figures. On May 4, AAA announced that Pozos had been released on bail. Pozos' bail was revoked on June 30, after which he was arrested at a AAA taping and taken to the Reclusorio Sur prison in Mexico City. On August 26, 2013, Pozos was sentenced to seven years and four months in prison of which he had already served two years. Pozos was released from prison in 2015 due to good behavior.|$|E
25|$|On April 23, 1864, when Steele {{received}} the dispatch from Banks asking that he join Banks {{so they could}} move again on Shreveport, Steele responded {{that he was in}} no position to join Banks. He also noted that he now faced not only Confederate cavalry but Sterling Price's returned infantry and additional infantry under Kirby Smith. Kirby Smith had joined Price with some of the infantry which had been with Taylor at the battle of Pleasant Hill. Brigadier-General Thomas Churchill’s Arkansas division and Brigadier-General Mosby Parsons's Missouri division had returned to Price's command. They were followed by Major-General John Walker’s larger Texas division with Kirby Smith. Kirby Smith had decided that Steele was a bigger threat, and a bigger prize, than Banks when Banks continued to retreat after the battle of Pleasant Hill on April 9, 1864. Kirby Smith thought he could destroy Steele's force and perhaps still turn back and trap Banks later. Taylor vehemently disagreed with this decision and wanted to attack Banks immediately. Nonetheless, Taylor could not convince Kirby Smith to change his plan. As Banks appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the naval force at Alexandria, Louisiana, Kirby Smith became even more certain that his decision was correct and he had time to execute it.|$|E
2500|$|When a hand is one tile {{short of}} winning (for example: [...] , waiting for: , , or , as [...] {{can be the}} eyes), the hand {{is said to be}} a ready hand (...) , or more figuratively, [...] "on the pot". The player holding a ready hand is said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> certain tiles. It is common <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> two or three tiles, and some {{variations}} award points for a hand that is waiting for one tile. In 13-tile Mahjong, the largest number of tiles for which a player can wait is 13 (the thirteen wonders, or 13 orphans, a nonstandard special hand). Ready hands must be declared in some variations of Mahjong, while other variations prohibit the same.|$|E

2500|$|Reports of the {{collapse}} of this part of the Union line caused great consternation at Grant's headquarters, leading to an interchange that is widely quoted in Grant biographies. An officer accosted Grant, proclaiming, [...] "General Grant, this is a crisis that cannot be looked upon too seriously. I know Lee's methods well by past experience; he will throw his whole army between us and the Rapidan, and cut us off completely from our communications." [...] Grant seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> such an opportunity and snapped, [...] "Oh, I am heartily tired of hearing about what Lee is going to do. Some of you always seem to think he is suddenly going to turn a double somersault, and land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time. Go back to your command, and try to think {{what we are going to}} do ourselves, instead of what Lee is going to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 19 October 1943, Biter {{with six}} Swordfish and six Martlets of No. 811 Naval Air Squadron on board left the Clyde {{to join the}} {{westbound}} convoy ON 207 which arrived at Argentia untroubled on 5 November. They left Argentia on 7 November to support convoy HX 265. Biter was the lead ship in the 5th Support Group, with the destroyers , Opportune and Obdurate. They—together with the 7th Escort Group—were tasked to sail [...] and [...] respectively ahead of the convoy. The intention was they would detect the two large concentrations of U-boats, that were known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the next eastbound convoy. Aircraft from Biter made several U-Boat sightings but did not sink any; one was reported as probably being damaged on 10 November. On 16 November a Swordfish coming into land crashed into the sea behind Biter. The force of the crash released the plane's homing torpedo which detonated on the carrier's rudder. The explosion damaged the steering, rudder assembly and some hull plates below the waterline. Once she reached Britain, it took four weeks to repair the damage.|$|E
