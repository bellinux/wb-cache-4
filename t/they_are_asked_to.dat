While shaking hands with him, Scully appears entranced, not coming to until Mulder catches her attention. The agents visit the Kindred's remote community, where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> surrender their guns before entering. Mulder and Scully are invited to dinner. When the Kindred refuse to allow Scully to treat Brother Aaron, a sick participant at the table, Brother Andrew states that the Kindred {{take care of their}} own.

5|$|During auditions for {{the school}} play, a romantic tension builds between Sunny and Zeke and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> play the lead roles. Sunny quits the play when she realises {{that she has to}} kiss Zeke. Sunny then finds out that Zeke is 'Lost Boy', but she forgives him. When she sees Donna Freedman practising the kissing scene with Zeke, Sunny becomes upset. Sunny and Zeke almost share a kiss one night when they are alone. However, they are {{interrupted}} by Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine). Due to rewrites of the play, Sunny's new character has to kiss Zeke too and Sunny grows uncomfortable again. During drama camp, Sunny and Zeke are locked in a cupboard during a game of truth or dare. They almost kiss again, but are interrupted when the door is opened. Karl realises that Sunny and Zeke like each other and he tries to keep them apart. However, they eventually start a relationship.|$|E

Lucy sees the invitation as a personal compliment, rather than what it is, a slight to Elinor and Marianne who, being family, should have received such invitation first. Too talkative, Anne Steele betrays Lucy's secret. As a result, the Misses Steele are turned out of the house, and Edward is ordered to break off the engagement on pain of disinheritance. Edward refuses to comply and is immediately disinherited in favour of his brother, gaining respect for his conduct, and sympathy from Elinor and Marianne. Colonel Brandon shows his admiration by offering Edward the living of Delaford parsonage, {{so that he can}} marry Lucy as soon as he is ordained.|$|E
25|$|Articulated {{thoughts}} in stimulated situations (ATSS): ATSS is a paradigm {{which was created}} {{as an alternative to}} the TA (think aloud) method. This method assumes that people have continuous internal dialogues that can be naturally attended to. ATSS also assesses a person’s inner thoughts as they verbalize their cognitions. In this procedure, subjects listen to a scenario via a video or audio player and are asked to imagine that they are in that specific situation. Later, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> articulate their thoughts as they occur in reaction to the playing scenario. This method is useful in studying emotional experience given that the scenarios used can influence specific emotions. Most importantly, the method has contributed to the study of personality. In a study conducted by Rayburn and Davison (2002), subjects’ thoughts and empathy toward anti-gay hate crimes were evaluated. The researchers found that participants showed more aggressive intentions towards the offender in scenarios which mimicked hate crimes.|$|E

25|$|Self-paced reading: The {{participants}} {{are faced with}} a screen, on which a text appears in successive segment. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> process each sequent segment by pressing a key. A trial starts with the presentation of groups of dashes separated by spaces. Each group serving as a placeholder for a word in the text, which is to be presented on that trial and each dash representing a letter. When the participant subsequently presses the key, the first segment appears, say the first two words, replacing the corresponding placeholders for the right words, while the placeholders for the left words remain on the screen. Once pressing the key again, the two words from the first segment are replaced by their placeholders again and the next segment appears, taking the position of the corresponding placeholders. This continues until the whole text has been read. A follow-up comprehension question is presented to ensure that participants indeed pay attention to the meaning of the sentences. The interval between the two successive key presses is measured and registered as the response time.|$|E

2500|$|The Face Advantage allows {{information}} and memories to be recalled easier through {{the presentation of}} a person's face rather than a person's voice. Faces and voices are very similar stimuli that reveal similar {{information and}} result in similar processes of memory recall. During face perception, there are three stages of memory recall that include recognition, followed by the remembering of semantic memory and episodic memory, and finally name recall. The Face Advantage is shown through an experiment where participants are presented with faces and voices of unfamiliar faces and recognizable celebrity faces. [...] The stimuli are presented with a between-group design. The participants are asked to say if the face or voice is familiar. If the answer is yes, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> recall semantic and episodic memories and finally {{the name of the}} face or voice. It was much easier for those presented with a celebrity's face to recall information than for those presented with a voice. The results show that in the second stage of face perception when memories are recalled, information is recalled faster and more accurate after a face is perceived, and slower, less accurate and with less detail after a voice is perceived. [...] A possible explanation is that the connections between face representations and semantic and episodic memory are stronger than that of voices.|$|E

If the raters identified the image as a blast cell, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> rate how similar the image was to a classic blast cell (with a rating of 1 being “not similar” and a rating of 5 being “very similar”). Raters were told that a classic blast cell image is one that might {{be used in a}} textbook. If raters identified the image as a non-blast cell, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> rate how morphologically similar the cell is to a blast cell (with a rating of 1 being “not similar” and a rating of 5 being “very similar”).|$|R

The song [...] "Bend It" [...] by the British 1960s pop group Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich {{is used in}} this episode. The [...] "Westside Pipeway" [...] scene is reminiscent of a scene in the 1927 silent film Metropolis. The program suggests that Brown University is now located in the mutant underground.

After this happens, one mutant says [...] "Are we not men!" [...] which is a reference to Devo's first album.|$|E
2500|$|Life {{satisfaction}} and Affect balance are generally measured separately and independently. [...] Life satisfaction is generally measured using a self-report method. A common measurement for life satisfaction is questionnaires. Affective balance is also generally measured using a self-report method. An {{example of a}} measurement of affective balance is the PANAS (Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule). [...] The issue with the current measurements of life {{satisfaction and}} affective balance {{is that they are}} self-reports. The problem with self-reports is that the participants may be lying or at least not telling the whole truth on the questionnaires. Participants may be lying or holding back from revealing certain things because they are either embarrassed or they may be filling in what they believe the researcher wants to see in the results. To gain more accurate results, other methods of measurement have been used to determine one’s SWB. Another way to corroborate or confirm that the self-report results are accurate is through informant reports. [...] Informant reports are given to the participant’s closest friends and family and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> fill out either a survey or a form asking about the participants mood, emotions, and overall lifestyle. The participant may write in the self-report that they are very happy, however that participant’s friends and family record that he/she is always depressed. This would obviously be a contradiction in results which would ultimately lead to inaccurate results. Another method of gaining {{a better understanding of the}} true results is through ESM, or the Experience Sampling Method. [...] In this measure, participants are given a beeper/pager that will randomly ring throughout the day. Whenever the beeper/pager sounds, the participant will stop what he/she is doing and record the activity they are currently engaged in and their current mood and feelings. Tracking this over a period of a week or a month will give researchers a better understanding of the true emotions, moods, and feelings the participant is experiencing, and how these factors interact with other thoughts and behaviors. A third measurement to ensure validity is the Day Reconstruction Method. [...] In this measure, participants fill out a diary of the previous days’ activities. The participant is then asked to describe each activity and provide a report of how they were feeling, what mood they were experiencing, and any emotions that surfaced. Thus to ensure valid results, a researcher may tend to use self-reports along with another form of measurement mentioned above. Someone with a high level of life satisfaction and a positive affective balance is said to have a high level of SWB.|$|E
