30|$|Until recently, Belgian law was indistinct {{about the}} {{possibilities}} of remunerating private individuals in return for services. Now, a tax system modification enables individuals to earn up to € 5000 per year with digital platforms, without the commitments of self-employment that include a value added <b>tax</b> <b>number</b> and social contributions [61]. This modification {{is in line with}} the ‘European agenda for the collaborative economy’. With this document, the European Commission provides legal guidance and policy orientation for the balanced and sustainable development of the sharing economy, in response to the variation of regulatory and tax policies across the EU member states. For the European Commission, setting thresholds under which an economic activity would be considered a non-professional peer-to-peer activity is a suitable way forward. Because of the blurring lines between consumers and businesses, it becomes less clear who represents the ‘weaker party’. Hence, uncertainty is created as to applicable rights and the required level of social protection [47]. In conclusion, although engaging private individuals in CL initiatives is permitted, the character distinction remains relevant.|$|E
