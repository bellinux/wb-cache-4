5|$|Bears may mark {{territory}} by rubbing against {{trees and}} other objects which may serve to spread their scent. This is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object. Bark may be spread around <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> marking post. Pandas are known to mark objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands. Polar bears leave behind their scent in their tracks which allow individuals {{to keep track of}} one another in the vast Arctic wilderness.|$|E
5|$|Hentoff {{wrote for}} many publications, {{including}} The New Yorker (1960—1986), The Washington Post (1984—2000), and The Washington Times. He {{worked with the}} Jazz Foundation of America to help many American jazz and blues musicians in need. He wrote many articles <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plight of America's pioneering jazz and blues musicians, which {{were published in the}} Wall Street Journal and the Village Voice.|$|E

5|$|On April 25, 1999, over 10,000 Falun Gong adherents {{demonstrated}} quietly {{near the}} Zhongnanhai government compound to request official recognition {{and an end}} to the escalating harassment against them. Security czar and politburo member Luo Gan was the first <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gathering crowd. Luo reportedly called Communist Party general secretary Jiang Zemin, and demanded a decisive solution to the Falun Gong problem.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht stated his {{original}} aim was <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> law, {{not to have}} Knut put down. In December 2006 he had taken legal action against Leipzig Zoo {{to prevent them from}} killing a sloth bear cub rejected by its mother. His case was dismissed on the grounds that humans raising the animal would have been against the law of nature. In response to the criticism against him, Albrecht said that he was merely drawing parallels between the two cubs. The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.|$|E
5|$|Following the government's {{closure of}} most of the schools in the 1960s, the work of Indigenous activists and historians led to greater {{awareness}} by the public of the damage the schools had caused, as well as to official government and church apologies, and a legal settlement. These gains were achieved through the persistent organizing and advocacy by Indigenous communities <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> residential school system's legacy of abuse, including their participation in hearings of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.|$|E

5|$|The Disney tag {{also was}} seen to have turned off people who assumed that the film was for children. In addition, Rocketeers {{original}} Art Deco poster was changed because it failed <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cast, including then-current James Bond, Timothy Dalton. A new poster was designed to feature Dalton, Billy Campbell and Jennifer Connelly prominently. The film also failed in Britain, grossing just over £1 million in its first two weeks at just under 250 screens. The new ad campaign was being designed while the British promotional campaign for the film was already under way and some theaters still had the stylized United States movie poster.|$|E
5|$|Contemplating {{advocacy}} {{work and}} a run for city council in Newark after graduation from law school, Booker {{lived in the city}} during his final year at Yale. After graduation, he served as staff attorney for the Urban Justice Center in New York and program coordinator of the Newark Youth Project. In 1998, Booker won an upset victory for a seat on the Newark City Council, defeating four-term incumbent George Branch. <b>To</b> <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> problems of open-air drug dealing and associated violence, he went on a 10-day hunger strike and lived in a tent and later in a motor home near drug-dealing areas of the city. Booker proposed council initiatives that impacted housing, young people, law and order, and the efficiency and transparency of city hall, but was regularly outvoted by all of his fellow councilors.|$|E
5|$|In tone clusters, {{the notes}} are sounded fully and in unison, {{distinguishing}} them from ornamented figures involving acciaccaturas and the like. Their effect {{also tends to}} be different: where ornamentation is used <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> harmony or the relationship between harmony and melody, tone clusters {{are for the most}} part employed as independent sounds. While, by definition, the notes that form a cluster must sound at the same time, there is no requirement that they must all begin sounding at the same moment. For example, in R. Murray Schafer's choral Epitaph for Moonlight (1968), a tone cluster is constructed by dividing each choir section (soprano/alto/tenor/bass) into four parts. Each of the sixteen parts enters separately, humming a note one semitone lower than the note hummed by the previous part, until all sixteen are contributing to the cluster.|$|E

5|$|Jane's legal husband, who {{was still}} living in London, {{attempted}} to blackmail her in 1838 by publishing {{the details of her}} marital status in Barnard Gregory's The Satirist. Johnson published the notice after learning that she was living with a Mr. Hogg. He was mistaken as to the identity of her lover, however, and attempted to blackmail James Hogg, a Member of Parliament for Beverly. After James Hogg prepared to bring a libel suit, Johnson quickly disappeared. Although one journalist initially planned to publish the correct identities of the parties involved, at Mary Shelley's request Leigh Hunt convinced him not to publish the story. Johnson died in Hammersmith in 1840, ensuring an end to the matter. Though they were now free to marry, Jane and Thomas declined to marry in order not <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that they had been unmarried for so long.|$|E
