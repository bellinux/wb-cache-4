5|$|The Haraldskær Woman (or Haraldskjaer Woman) is a bog {{body of a}} woman found {{naturally}} {{preserved in}} a bog in Jutland, Denmark, and dating from about 490 BC (pre-Roman Iron Age). Workers found the body in 1835 while excavating peat on the Haraldskær Estate. The anaerobic conditions and acids of the peat bog contributed to the body's excellent preservation. Not only was the intact skeleton found, but so were the skin and internal organs. Scientists settled disputes about the age and identity of <b>this</b> <b>well</b> preserved body in 1977, when radiocarbon dating determined conclusively that the woman's death occurred around the 5th century BC.|$|E

The Uniacke well, which was being drilled from the semi-submersible rig Vinland, took about ten days to bring under control. By contrast, the blowout at West Venture took eight months to shut in.|$|E
