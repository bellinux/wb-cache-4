60|$|Then {{this short}} paper of six lines was slipped aside {{and a long}} one of many pages was smuggled into its place, and she, noting nothing, put her mark on it, saying, in pathetic apology, {{that she did not}} know how to write. But a {{secretary}} of the King of England was there <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> defect; he guided her hand with his own, and wrote her name--Jehanne.|$|E

60|$|The Ammonites' god was Ammon, {{the hidden}} god, {{the lord of}} their sheep and cattle. The Zidonians had Ashtoreth, the moon. The Phoenicians worshipped Moloch, the fire. Many of the Canaanites worshipped Baal, the lord, or Baalim, the lords--the sun, moon, and stars. The Philistines {{afterwards}} (for we read nothing of Philistines in Moses' time) worshipped Dagon, the fish-god, and so forth. The Egyptians had gods without number--gods invented out of beasts, and birds, and {{the fruits of the}} earth, and the season, and the weather, and the sun and moon and stars. Each class and trade, from the highest to the lowest, and each city and town throughout the land seems to have had its special god, who was worshipped there, and expected <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> particular class of men or that particular place.|$|E
60|$|Our friend Pen was {{not sorry}} when his Mentor took leave {{of the young}} gentleman {{on the second day}} after the arrival of the pair in Oxbridge, and we may be sure that the Major on his part was very glad to have {{discharged}} his duty, and to have the duty over. More than three months of precious time had that martyr of a Major given up to his nephew--Was ever selfish man called upon to make a greater sacrifice? Do you know many men or Majors who would do as much? A man will lay down his head, or peril his life for his honour, but let us be shy how we ask him to give up his ease or his heart's desire. Very few of us can bear that trial. Say, worthy reader, if thou hast peradventure a beard, wouldst thou do as much? I will not say that a woman will not. They are used to it: we take care to accustom them to sacrifices but, my good sir, the amount of self-denial which you have probably exerted through life, when put down to your account elsewhere, will not probably swell the balance on the credit side much. Well, well, there is no use in speaking of such ugly matters, and you are too polite to use a vulgar to quoque. But I wish to state once for all that I greatly admire the Major for his conduct during the past quarter, and think that he has quite a right to be pleased at getting a holiday. Foker and Pen saw him off in the coach, and the former young gentleman gave particular orders to the coachman <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> gentleman inside. It pleased the elder Pendennis to have his nephew {{in the company of a}} young fellow who would introduce him to the best set of the university. The Major rushed off to London and thence to Cheltenham, from which Watering-place he descended upon some neighbouring great houses, whereof the families were not gone abroad, and where good shooting and company was to be had.|$|E

50|$|Livestock {{operations}} {{can also}} {{use a lot of}} energy depending on how they are run. Feed lots use animal feed made from corn, soybeans, and other crops.

The farmer may expend energy <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> vegetation, but not nearly as much as the farmer growing cereal and oil-seed crops.|$|E
