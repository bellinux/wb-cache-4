5|$|The text is {{presented}} in six stanzas of nine lines each. It is in bar form, three lines form the Stollen, three the Abgesang, with the meter 6.6.5.6.6.5.7.8.6. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the last stanza repeats {{the first line of}} the first stanza.

5|$|Simultaneously, von Pahlen's Corps {{attacked}} forts 23 and 24, and the Polish {{position at}} the Evangelical Cemetery. Heavy fighting followed, and many Russian commanders, including Paskevich, proposed that further fighting be postponed until the following day. General von Toll insisted on reaching <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> Polish defences before sunset. The surrounding forts changed hands many times, {{but in the end}} most of them remained in Russian hands by 22:00, when the Russians broke off. Around midnight General Berg arrived in Warsaw with a new ultimatum signed by Paskevich.|$|E
5|$|The {{defensive}} backfield, {{often called}} the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S). Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS). Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, typically opposite of a receiver {{so as to be}} able to cover him, while safeties line up between the cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary. Safeties are <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to a request from the New Zealand government, Barrowclough was nominated by Freyberg for command of the Pacific Section of 2NZEF, which was based in Fiji. With the entry of Imperial Japan into the war, this was an important command as Fiji was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defence for mainland New Zealand. Barrowclough embarked for New Zealand in early 1942 but during his transit, the commanding officer of the Pacific Section became seriously ill and was invalided home to be immediately replaced by Major General Owen Mead. On Barrowclough's arrival in New Zealand, he was disappointed to find that his expected command was no longer available. He was eventually posted as {{the commander of the}} Northern Division with the rank of major general. He was responsible for the defence of the upper North Island, and {{for the next few months}} oversaw the reorganisation and training of his new command.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{soldiers}} marched from Shanghai to Nanking at a breakneck pace, rapidly defeating {{pockets of}} Chinese resistance. By December 9 {{they had reached}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defense, the Fukuo Line, behind which lay Nanking's fortified walls. On December 10 Matsui ordered an all-out attack on Nanking, and after less than two days of intense fighting Chiang decided to abandon the city. Before fleeing, Tang ordered his men to launch a concerted breakout of the Japanese siege, but by this time Nanking was largely surrounded and its defenses were at the breaking point. Most of Tang's units simply collapsed, their soldiers often casting off their weapons and uniforms in {{the streets in the}} hopes of hiding among the city's civilian population.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{begins in}} orbit above planet Reach, as {{humanity}} fights the Covenant invasion forces. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defense {{for the planet}} is an array of magnetic accelerator cannons (MACs) orbiting the planet. The Master Chief sends a team of Spartans {{to the surface of}} Reach to protect the MAC's planet-based power generators. Ultimately, the Covenant are able to destroy the generators and begin bombarding the planet's surface - melting its surface to glass ('glassing the planet'). The surviving Spartans flee underground to the hidden headquarters of the Office of Naval Intelligence. There they meet Dr. Halsey who, with help of some of the surviving Spartans, uncovers a strange crystalline shard in a cavern built by the ancient Forerunners. Pursued by the Covenant, the Spartans retrieve the shard and collapse the passage behind them, which saves them from the pursuing Covenant forces, but also traps them deep under the surface of Reach.|$|E

25|$|Originally, a full-back was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defence, but as {{the game}} {{developed}} in the early 20th century, the centre-half role was dropped backwards and {{came to be known}} as 'centre-back', and the full-backs were then pushed out wider to create the right-back and left-back positions.|$|E

25|$|Surge {{protective}} devices {{are designed to}} reduce the random energy surges of voltage transients and electrical noise on the power supply line that can damage sensitive electronics such as TVs, computers, and smart appliances. They are available for 120V, 15/20A applications, in different form factors such as surge protective receptacles in single, duplex, four-in-one, and six receptacle configurations as well as surge-protective power strips. These devices provide point-of-use protection and are <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defense in a whole house surge protection network.|$|E
25|$|Albertus, {{written in}} 1831 and {{published}} in 1832, is a long narrative poem of 122 stanzas, each consisting of 12 lines of alexandrine (12-syllable) verse, except for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> each stanza, which is octosyllabic. Albertus is a parody of Romantic literature, especially of tales of the macabre and the supernatural. The poem tells a story of an ugly witch who magically transforms at midnight into an alluring young woman. Albertus, the hero, falls deeply in love and agrees to sell his soul.|$|E
25|$|As {{in other}} major American {{cities in the}} postwar era, {{construction}} of an extensive highway and freeway system around Detroit and pent-up demand for new housing stimulated suburbanization; highways made commuting by car easier. In 1956, Detroit's last heavily used electric streetcar line {{along the length of}} Woodward Avenue was removed and replaced with gas-powered buses. It was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> what had once been a 534-mile network of electric streetcars. In 1941 at peak times, a streetcar ran on Woodward Avenue every 60 seconds.|$|E

25|$|Ioannis Tsoukalas of Stockholm University has {{hypothesized}} that REM sleep is an evolutionary transformation of a well-known defensive mechanism, the tonic immobility reflex. This reflex, {{also known as}} animal hypnosis or death feigning, functions as <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defense against an attacking predator and consists of the total immobilization of the animal so that it appears dead. Tsoukalas argues that the neurophysiology and phenomenology of this reaction shows striking similarities to REM sleep; for example, both reactions exhibit brainstem control, paralysis, hypocampal theta rhythm, and thermoregulatory changes.|$|E
25|$|By {{the morning}} of 15 February, the Japanese had broken through <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defence {{in the north and}} food and some kinds of {{ammunition}} had begun to run out. After meeting his unit commanders, Percival contacted the Japanese and formally surrendered the Allied forces to Yamashita, shortly after 5:15pm. Bennett created an enduring controversy when he handed over the 8th Division to the divisional artillery commander, Brigadier Cecil Callaghan, commandeered a boat and managed to escape captivity. According to Frank Owen, his lack of inspired leadership was exemplified by one of his last orders: because of lack of ammunition he issued orders that Australian gunners were only to offer artillery support in their own sector. He did not inform Percival of this order.|$|E
