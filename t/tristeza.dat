500|$|Such {{disasters}} {{occurred when}} human intervention caused ecological changes by {{the introduction of}} crops to new vectors and viruses. Cacao is native to South America and was introduced to West Africa in the late 19th century. In 1936, swollen root disease had been transmitted to plantations by mealybugs from indigenous trees. New habitats can trigger outbreaks of plant virus diseases. Before 1970, the rice yellow mottle virus was only found in the Kisumu district of Kenya, but following the irrigation of large areas of East Africa and extensive rice cultivation, the virus spread throughout East Africa. Human activity [...] introduced plant viruses to native crops. The citrus <b>tristeza</b> virus (CTV) was introduced to South America from Africa between 1926 and 1930. At the same time, the aphid Toxoptera citricidus was carried from Asia to South America and this accelerated the transmission of the virus. By 1950, more than six million citrus trees had been killed by the virus in São Paulo, Brazil. CTV and citrus trees probably coevolved for centuries in their original countries. The dispersal of CTV to other regions and its interaction with new citrus varieties resulted in devastating outbreaks of plant diseases. Because of the problems caused by the introduction– by humans– of plant viruses, many countries have strict importation controls on any materials that can harbour dangerous plant viruses or their insect vectors.|$|E
2500|$|Oscar Peterson at the Stratford Shakespearean Festival {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as the landmark album in Peterson's career, {{and one of the most}} influential trios in jazz. Their last recording, On the Town with the Oscar Peterson Trio, recorded live at the Town Tavern in Toronto, captured a remarkable degree of emotional as well as musical understanding between three players. All three musicians were equal contributors involved in a highly sophisticated improvisational interplay. When Ellis left the group in 1958, Peterson and Brown believed they could not adequately replace Ellis. Ellis was replaced by drummer Ed Thigpen in 1959. Brown and Thigpen worked with Peterson on his albums Night Train and Canadiana Suite. Brown and Thigpen left in 1965 and were replaced by bassist Sam Jones and drummer Louis Hayes (and later, drummer Bobby Durham). The trio performed together until 1970. In 1969 Peterson recorded Motions and Emotions, featuring orchestral arrangements of pop songs such as The Beatles' [...] "Yesterday" [...] and [...] "Eleanor Rigby". In the fall of 1970, Peterson's trio released the album <b>Tristeza</b> on Piano. Jones and Durham left in 1970.|$|E

La trama humana en su conjunto se desarrolla entre <b>tristezas</b> y alegrías y, también, lógicamente, la {{historia de}} la Iglesia posee los mismos condimentos. Pero, la clave está en la luz con la cual miramos estos acontecimientos que, en este caso, no sólo será científica o meramente sociológica sino, fundamentalmente, teológica. Así, al recoger los testimonios del pueblo de Dios, presentamos un hecho histórico reflejado a través del prisma de la fe. Abstract: This {{contribution}} tries {{to achieve a}} synchronic look of bishop’s Enrique Angelelli tragedy. The human network as a whole develops between sadness and joy and also, of course, {{the history of the}} Catholic Church goes along the same paths. But the clue is the light through which we look at these events, in this case, not only we shall see the story purely scientifically or sociologically, but also, fundamentally from theological point of view. So, after gathering the testimonies of God’s people, we present a historical fact reflected by the prism of faith...|$|R

No texto memorialístico, o autor recupera e organiza as vivências do seu eu-criança e, assim, procura compreender quem foi e quem é. Ao narrar os primeiros momentos de sua vida, Saramago retorna à infância na tentativa de rememorar vivências e situações pessoais, familiares e sociais que dela fizeram parte. Nessa busca, as recordações do escritor emergem relacionadas aos sentimentos que marcaram seu passado: medos, alegrias, angústias e <b>tristezas.</b> Reconstruir conscientemente esse percurso é perceber as marcas desses momentos vividos pela criança de ontem no adulto de hoje. The {{memories}} of childhood are rescued by Jose Saramago {{in his book}} As pequenas memórias, released in 2006.

While narrates the first moments of his life, Saramago returns to his childhood and attempts to recall his personals experiences and also the social and family situations that were part of it. In this search, the writer’s memories emerge related to those feelings that have marked his past: fears, joys, sorrows and anxieties. Reconstructing, consciously, this pathway is perceiving the marks of those moments experienced by the children of yesterday in the adult of today...|$|R
