5|$|The {{process of}} deep frying food is {{generally}} detrimental to its nutritional value. The oils that foods absorb in their batter typically contain {{large amounts of}} fats, especially saturated fats and <b>trans</b> <b>fats.</b> Consumption of large amounts of saturated and <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> {{has been linked to}} a higher risk for some cancers including prostate cancer. Eating deep-fried foods has also been linked to higher cholesterol levels, obesity, heart attacks, and diabetes. Deep-fried foods cooked at certain temperatures can also contain acrylamide, a possible carcinogen.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of <b>trans</b> <b>fats,</b> such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|In the 38th Canadian Parliament Dosanjh was {{appointed}} Minister of Health {{in the federal}} Cabinet. As Health Minister, Dosanjh strongly supported Canada's existing single-tier, publicly funded health-care system. Dosanjh introduced legislation to make cigarettes fire safe, new regulations to further limit lead content in children's jewelry, and supported an NDP motion to ban <b>trans</b> <b>fats.</b> He advocated that Canada ratify the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which they did in November 2004. Dosanjh funded a program to revise the Canada food guide to include more multicultural foods and another program to integrate foreign-trained medical professionals into the health-care system. Supported by a unanimous vote in the House of Commons, the government agreed to compensate the 6,000 Canadians infected with hepatitis C from tainted blood transfusion. Along with Prime Minister Martin, a 10-year, $41 billion funding plan was negotiated with the provinces to deliver health care – with $5.5 billion to specifically address wait times that had been an election issue during the 2004 federal election – but they rejected Premiers' demands for a national program to purchase pharmaceuticals in bulk. As the Minister of Health, Dosanjh introduced Bill C-12 An Act to prevent the introduction and spread of communicable diseases which updated the 1985 Quarantine Act; it was given royal assent in May 2005.|$|E

40|$|After the {{discovery}} that <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> {{increases the risk of}} coronary heart disease, <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> content of foods have considerably changed. The aim {{of this study was to}} systematically review available data on intakes of <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> and its dietary sources in general populations worldwide. Data from national dietary surveys and population studies published from 1995 onward were searched via Scopus and websites of national public health institutes. Relevant data from 29 countries were identified. The most up to date estimates of total <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> intake ranged from 0. 3 to 4. 2 percent of total energy intake (En%) across countries. Seven countries had <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> intakes higher than the World Health Organization recommendation of 1 En%. In 16 out of 21 countries with data on dietary sources, intakes of <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> from animal sources were higher than that from industrial sources. Time trend data from 20 countries showed substantial declines in industrial <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> intake since 1995. In conclusion, nowadays, in the majority of countries for which data are available, average <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> intake is lower than the recommended maximum intake of 1 En%, with intakes from animal sources being higher than from industrial sources. In the past 20 years, substantial reductions in industrial <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> have been achieved in many countries...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dietary <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> {{increases}} {{risk for}} coronary heart disease.

Design: Cross-sectional study that included purchase receipts matched to available nutritional information and brief surveys of adult lunchtime restaurant customers conducted in 2007 and 2009, before and after implementation of the regulation. Setting: 168 randomly selected NYC restaurant locations of 11 fast-food chains. Participants: Adult restaurant customers interviewed in 2007 and 2009.

25|$|Studies in {{the early}} 1990s, however, brought renewed {{scrutiny}} and confirmation of the negative health impact of <b>trans</b> <b>fats.</b> In 1994, {{it was estimated that}} <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> caused 20,000 deaths annually in the United States from heart disease.|$|E
25|$|However, when {{partially}} hydrogenated, {{part of the}} unsaturated {{fatty acids}} become unhealthy <b>trans</b> <b>fats.</b> Consumers are increasingly avoiding products that contain <b>trans</b> <b>fats,</b> and governments have begun to ban <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> in food products. These regulations and market pressures have spurred the development of low-α-linolenic acid soybeans. These new soybean varieties yield a more stable oil that doesn't require hydrogenation for many applications, thus providing trans fat-free products, such as frying oil.|$|E
25|$|The American Public Health Association {{adopted a}} new policy {{statement}} regarding <b>trans</b> <b>fats</b> in 2007.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> bans in restaurants on cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality rates. Evidence from the medical community indicates that even low levels of artificial <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> consumption increases the incidence of CVD such as heart disease. New York City and six New York State county health departments have responded to this public health concern by mandating that all food service establishments {{limit the amount of}} <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> contained in their food products. Our analysis exploits the within-county variation over time in the <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> content in the local food supply resulting from the policy mandate and the differential timing of its rollout across counties to estimate the mortality effects of reducing the amount of artificial <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> in food away from home. The results indicate that <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> bans cause a 4 % reduction in CVD mortality rates, which translates into a reduction of about 12 CVD deaths per 100, 000 persons per year. Using recent estimates of the Value of a Statistical Life-Year, we estimate that the fatal heart attacks prevented by <b>trans</b> <b>fat</b> bans, even if they extend life by only one year, can be valued at about $ 3 million per 100, 000 persons annually...|$|R
