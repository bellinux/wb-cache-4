The {{occasion}} was the 1905 Salon d'Automne (18 October to 25 November), an exhibition that witnessed the birth of Fauvism. [...] "A pot of paint has been flung {{in the face of}} the public," [...] wrote the critic Camille Mauclair. Louis Vauxcelles coined the phrase les fauves ('the wild beasts') <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> of painters exhibiting in the same room as a classical sculpture. He stated his criticism of their works by describing the sculpture as [...] "a Donatello amongst wild beasts" [...] (Donatello chez les fauves). Another art critic responding to the Salon d'Automne, , wrote in the Journal de Rouen on 20 November that these works have [...] "no relation to painting" [...] and compared them to [...] "the barbaric and naïve games of a child who plays with a box of colors". Of Pinchon's three paintings (Le Pont Transbordeur à Rouen, Le Pont de Boieldieu, à Rouen, Vieilles Cabanes dans l'Île Lacroix, à Rouen) he wrote: [...] "Showing for his first time in Paris... the technique is a bit heavy, but we shouldn't be too severe toward a beginner, especially after what we saw elsewhere in the Salon". Though Pinchon had not exhibited in room VII with the fauves, his palette was already pure and his impasto thick.|$|E
2500|$|While many of {{his contemporaries}} {{believed}} in the aether as a medium for transmitting attraction or repulsion between separated celestial bodies, Hooke argued for an attracting principle of gravitation in Micrographia of 1665. Hooke's 1666 Royal Society lecture [...] "On gravity" [...] added two further principles– that all bodies move in straight lines till deflected by some force and that the attractive force is stronger for closer bodies. Dugald Stewart, in his Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind, quoted Hooke's own words on his system of the world. [...] "I will explain," [...] says Hooke, in a communication to the Royal Society in 1666, [...] "a system of the world very different from any yet received. It is founded on the following positions. 1. That all the heavenly bodies have not only a gravitation of their parts to their own proper centre, but that they also mutually attract each other within their spheres of action. 2. That all bodies having a simple motion, will continue to move in a straight line, unless continually deflected from it by some extraneous force, causing them <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle,</b> an ellipse, or some other curve. 3.

5000|$|Although the European {{nautical}} tradition {{retained the}} term [...] "one point" [...] <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> [...] of <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> (in such phrases as [...] "two points to starboard"), {{by the middle}} of the eighteenth century, the 32-point system was further extended with half- and quarter-points to allow 128 directions to be differentiated.

50|$|A related {{problem with}} this {{inheritance}} arises when considering the implementation. An ellipse requires more states <b>to</b> be <b>described</b> than <b>a</b> <b>circle,</b> because the former needs attributes to specify the length and rotation of the {{major and minor axes}} whereas <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> needs only <b>a</b> radius. It may be possible to avoid this if the language (such as Eiffel) makes constant values of a class, functions without arguments, and data members interchangeable.|$|R

40|$|Isn’t {{a circle}} {{a special case}} of an ellipse? Your average {{geometry}} student would think so. But expressing this basic relationship in Java isn’t exactly child’s play. The proverbial “simplest thing that could possibly work ” would be to declare an Ellipse class along with a Circle subclass. That’s dandy from a modeling standpoint, as it faithfully represents the geometric relationship. Trouble is, it’s a wasteful implementation. Making Circle a subclass of Ellipse ensures that a circle will consume as much memory as an ellipse, even though it takes strictly less memory <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle.</b> You can always dissolve the inheritance relationship to save bytes, but then the code no longer expresses that fact that a circle {{is a kind of}} ellipse. You’d look like a math flunky. Here lurks a classic conflict in object-oriented design: A class decomposition that best models a domain may well constitute a lousy implementation, and vice versa. Needless to say, we want to have our cake and eat it too. Enter BRIDGE 1, the pattern we’ll be renovating today. I say “we ” not in the royal sense but in the plural, because I’ve enlisted the services of Erich Gamma for this effort. Rather than rattling off changes sectionby-section, as has been my wont, Erich and I will be considering only the choicest issues, new and old.
