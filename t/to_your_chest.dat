5000|$|Other {{cultures}} have types of blason poetry. For instance, Ethiopia has a genre of poetry called Mälkəˀ, meaning [...] "image" [...] or [...] "portrait,” generally {{written in the}} language of Gəˁəz in honor of sacred individuals. Such poems list and eulogize the spiritual powers of the saint, using the metaphor of various body parts, starting with the hair, eyelashes, tongue, and lips, moving down to the throat, breasts, and belly, and from there down to legs and toes, among other parts. For an example, see the poem Mälkəˀa: [...] Hail to your back, which cast off luxurious cloaks,''''and <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>chest,</b> a banquet-table for the wretched.''''Walatta Petros, our mother, lover of fasting and prayer,''''request forgiveness for our sins before the Lord:''''Thus we implore you, we who are yours.|$|E

[...] Later that same month, Lynn and Mohr shot an interview about ADIEU., mental health and other topics at iHeartMedia Portland. In a long-form review of the album published on Lynn's website, Mohr {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "Logan Lynn’s ADIEU is a victory for the broken bones and bruised hearts that support our heavy souls.

5000|$|Rick Swan {{reviewed}} The Complete Book of Necromancers for Dragon magazine #222 (October 1995). He {{comments that}} [...] "Kurtz's literate, no-nonsense style makes {{this one of}} the most readable entries in the series. He employs, however, a pair of premises that may not sit well with everyone, especially those who like their AD&D in-your-face and unconditional." [...] He found the character kits [...] "intriguing but tame", especially the Anatomist and Philosopher, and noted that even the Deathslayer, [...] "a selfless enemy of dangerous undead, comes off as a pussycat". Swan found that [...] "the serious tone gives necromancers an unexpected depth, certain to satisfy those who prefer Masterpiece Theater to Beavis and Butthead. But players used to the unapologetic assault of Werewolf and Call of Cthulhu may find it all a little too, uh, nice." [...] He goes on to say, [...] "If you buy the approach, however, you're in for a treat. Kurtz has packed the book with sharp insights and inspired mechanics." [...] Swan found the death gods to be [...] "masterful inventions; the Queen of the Noose rules as the patron of premeditated killing, and followers of the God of Pestilence foster disease by harvesting slime from corpses." [...] Swan concludes in his evaluation: [...] "If you're a DM who runs an ordered campaign, and you're in the market for necromancer NPCs, this is the book for you. But if you're a player interested in ruling a kingdom of zombies or sewing tentacles <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>chest,</b> keep looking. Reserved and brainy, The Complete Book of Necromancers is the role-playing equivalent of a college text, an erudite collection of provocative ideas. Just don't expect it give you the creeps." ...|$|E

40|$|Primary-care {{physicians}} need a sound {{understanding of}} the tools available when investigating a patient with chest discomfort. Considering all the syndromes present-ing to the primary-care physician, it is perhaps the constellation of symptoms involving atypical chest discomfort that {{is among the most}} perplexing. As we begin the 21 st century, the num-ber of investigational tools at our disposal must be used thoughtfully and appropriate-ly, in order to avoid skyrocketing costs and, in some cases, unnecessary exposure to the risks routinely associated with invasive pro-cedures. There is a three in 1, 000 chance of a major cardiovascular complication, including myocardial infarction, stroke, or death. There is also a three in 100 chance of local vascular complication at the arterial access site. This review details a thorough, yet expedient, approach to this challenging issue, one which is often faced by primary-care physicians.
