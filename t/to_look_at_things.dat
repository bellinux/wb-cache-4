500|$|Biden's most {{important}} role {{within the administration}} was to question assumptions, playing a contrarian role. Obama said that [...] "The best thing about Joe {{is that when we}} get everybody together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>things</b> from every angle, and that is very valuable for me." [...] Another senior Obama advisor said Biden [...] "is always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure we are as intellectually honest as possible." [...] On June 11, 2010, Biden represented the United States at the opening ceremony of the World Cup, attended the England v. U.S. game which was tied 1–1, and visited Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa.|$|E
500|$|Campaign {{magazine}} listed [...] "Cog", {{along with}} Balls for the Sony BRAVIA line of high-definition televisions, {{as one of}} the most-imitated commercials in recent times. Among the pieces believed to draw inspiration from [...] "Cog" [...] are a 2003 piece for breakfast cereal Sugar Puffs, Nearness for the Oslo School of Architecture and Design, a 30-second animated advertisement for Heinz Tomato Ketchup, an advertisement for BBC Radio Merseyside football coverage, and the 2007 Tipping Point, advertising Guinness stout. When asked about the similarities between [...] "Cog" [...] and [...] "Tipping Point", Paul Brazier, executive creative director at the advertising agency behind Tipping Point, replied: [...] "I knew the ad was similar in places, but as an executive creative director, you have <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>things</b> like that and make a decision. The fact the TV ad was only part of a huge internet campaign meant that I thought it wasn’t that near [...] "Cog"." ...|$|E
500|$|Initial {{reactions}} to Akane were mixed. Hiroko Yamamura from Japanator {{liked the way}} the first episode focused on Akane's first day {{as a police officer}} and her opinions of it. Thomas Zoth from The Fandom Post said Akane's personality is typical of those in dramas; he called her a [...] "naive waif who gets over her head with her first case". Zoth said that in later episodes, he liked the relationship Akane established with Masaoka and Ginoza, which resulted in several interesting scenes. Zoth said he grew to care about Akane {{during the first half of}} the series in [...] "a somewhat ironically 'moe' way, as she's grown as a character". In a similar review, Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network said Akane's actions in the first episode [...] " [...] her up as the clear-eyed, albeit naïve, outsider of the story, willing <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>things</b> differently". David West from Neo noted how weak Akane's character was in early episodes due to how often Kogami did her work. Moreover, once Kogami was impressed by Akane when she requested to revive her traumatic experience to see Makishima's face, West still felt the character was underdeveloped in contrast to Kogami's comments about her growth.|$|E
