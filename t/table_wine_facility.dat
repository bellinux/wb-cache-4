40|$|While the {{utilization}} of scanner data for food demand analyses has become increasingly popular in the United States, few food demand studies, and in particular none on <b>table</b> <b>wine,</b> have been conducted using scanner data in Italy. This paper presents a first attempt to estimate a demand system for selected brands of red tetra-packaged, plastic packaged, and bag-in-box <b>table</b> <b>wine</b> using scanner data providing new and useful insights into the marketing of Italian wine. Price and expenditure elasticities of Italian red <b>table</b> <b>wine</b> demand drawn from a linear almost ideal demand system are provided.

40|$|A aceitação de nove amostras comerciais de vinhos brancos brasileiros, de três diferentes linhas varietais (Riesling, Chardonnay e Gewürztraminer), foi avaliada por 43 consumidores de vinhos brancos nacionais, utilizando a escala hedônica estruturada de nove pontos. Os provadores foram recrutados através de um questionário de avaliação de hábitos de consumo de vinho branco. Duas metodologias distintas foram utilizadas para avaliar os dados obtidos: o Mapa de Preferência Interno (MDPREF) e Análise de Variância (ANOVA) com comparação de médias (teste de Tukey).

Subsequently, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with means comparision (Tukey test) and Internal Analysis of Preference Mapping (MDPREF) were performed on data. Analysis of Variance showed that two samples (a Riesling and a Gewürztraminer, both sweet <b>table</b> <b>wines)</b> had significantly (p < 0. 05) higher acceptance means, around 7 in the hedonic scale. The least acceptance means (4, 3) was obtained by a demi-sec Chardonnay wine and the other six samples achieved means around 5 in the hedonic scale, all of them either demi-sec or dry <b>table</b> <b>wines.</b> MDPREF confirmed the results showed by ANOVA showing that samples were segmented into two groups of preference.
