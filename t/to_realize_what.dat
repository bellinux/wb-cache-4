25|$|Up to this time, Jacob Grimm {{had been}} driven only by a general thirst for knowledge, and his {{energies}} had not found any aim beyond the practical one of making himself a position in life. The first definite impulse came from the lectures of Friedrich Karl von Savigny, the celebrated investigator of Roman law, who first taught him <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>what</b> it meant to study any science, as Wilhelm Grimm himself says {{in the preface to}} the Deutsche Grammatik (German Grammar). Savigny's lectures also awakened in him a love for historical and antiquarian investigation, which forms the structure of all his work. The two men became personally acquainted, and it was in Savigny's well-stocked library that Grimm first turned over the leaves of Bodmer's edition of the Middle High German minnesingers and other early texts, and felt an eager desire to penetrate further into the obscurities and half-revealed mysteries of their language.|$|E
500|$|... "Field Trip" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz, who described the writing process as [...] "an experience". The script went through several phases; originally, the script was supposed to feature Mulder trapped in a cave with a mysterious monster. Then, the script was changed so that both Mulder and Scully would be trapped in the cave. Finally, the story was altered so that both Mulder and Scully only believed that they two were trapped in a cave, with only Mulder beginning <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>what</b> was actually going on.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene in}} which Yang (Oh) and Hunt (McKidd) were partaking in couples therapy, was {{originally}} planned to be a comical moment. Vernoff commented on this: [...] "I handed them that scene 20 MINUTES BEFORE CAMERAS ROLLED. It was actually a funny scene {{right up until the}} last minute. Sandra and Kevin had smart questions – and what became crystal clear to me instantly is that this storyline could not be resolved in a humorous way. It had earned weight. Indeed, it required weight." [...] In the episode, Meredith (Pompeo) grieves her pain through constant sex with Shepherd. Vernoff explained she loves the fact that Meredith is healthy enough <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>what</b> she is doing.

500|$|Heather Phares from AllMusic gave it {{five out}} of five stars and said: [...] "Madonna's Video Collection: 1993-1999 adds to her status {{as one of the}} best {{represented}} artists on DVD. [...] Though it doesn't offer much in the way of DVD-specific features, the artistry of directors like Mark Romanek, Stephane Sedaoui, David Fincher, Jean-Baptiste Mondino, as well as Madonna herself, is on full display with videos like 'Take a Bow', 'Bedtime Story', 'Human Nature', 'Frozen', and 'Ray of Light'. All in all, it's a worthwhile collection of memorable videos from one of pop's trendsetters." [...] Bryan Chin from University Wire commented [...] "Some people really dislike the Madonna of the '90s. 'Oh, she got so slutty!, they quibble. 'She doesn't have the same kind of cultural impact that she had in the '80s,' they whine. Obviously, these people haven't been paying much attention. With the recent release of The Video Collection 93:99, however, those naysayers are certain <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>what</b> they've been missing. These videos have always been the perfect outlet to chronicle Madonna's smorgasbord of personas." ...|$|E
500|$|While School Rumble is {{generally}} recognised as a shōnen title targeting the young male market, Katherine Luther, staff reviewer for About.com, refers {{to it as}} a shōjo title aimed at girls and young women. Lisa Marie, reviewer for RightStuf's Anime Today podcast, agrees that others, notably males, might see the series as shōjo. Luther calls the first DVD [...] "the perfect back-to-school accessory", while Marie characterizes School Rumble as [...] "insane", asserting it appears on the surface more laid back than other titles like Excel Saga and Haré + Guu. However, it uses its [...] "cast to breakevery rule of reality, but it plays everything so straight [...] it takes you a moment <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>what</b> just happened doesn't make any sense." [...] A fan of the subgenre, she praises the anime it for its surreal humour, and for being [...] "anime newbie friendly" [...] in that its jokes work on multiple levels. Not all are of Japanese origin—such as a reference to the long triangular resolution of Star Wars Return of the Jedi—giving the series broad appeal.|$|E

500|$|U2 {{returned}} to Dublin for Christmas, where they discussed their future together and all recommitted to the group. Listening to the tapes, they agreed their material sounded {{better than they}} originally thought. They briefly {{returned to}} Berlin in January 1991 to finish their work at Hansa. Reflecting on their time in Berlin, Clayton called the sessions a [...] "baptism of fire" [...] and said, [...] "It was something {{we had to go}} through <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>what</b> we were trying to get to was not something you could find physically, outside of ourselves, in some other city—that there was not magic to it and that we actually had to put the work in and figure out the ideas and hone those ideas down." [...] Although just two songs were delivered during their two months in Berlin, the Edge said that in retrospect, working there had been more productive and inspirational than the output had suggested. The band had been removed from a familiar environment, providing what they described as a certain [...] "texture and cinematic location", and many of their incomplete ideas would be revisited in the subsequent Dublin sessions with success.|$|E

Tytla and Babbitt quickly became two of Disney's top-salaried artists, and again shared a residencethis time a Tuxedo Terrace house complete with a maid. He continued to send money home and purchased for his family 150 acre (607,000m²) of farmland in East Lyme, Connecticut. Babbitt started after hours [...] "Action Analysis" [...] classes and brought in Don Graham to teach. Tytla was an eager participator in these classes (later to become officially sanctioned by Disney) which have been credited {{with some of the}} phenomenal leaps in the quality of animation during this period.|$|E

2500|$|Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter {{was more}} {{critical}} of the documentary, calling it [...] "lightweight but warm-hearted" [...] and a [...] "genial love letter to a minor musical cult", but saying that it [...] "starts to lose momentum in its midsection as the turnover of interchangeable band members takes on a slightly Groundhog Day feel. In a break from rockumentary tradition, LaCoeur and Riggle fail to unearth any backstage dirt or drama here." [...] He complained that the portions on Stevenson's relationship {{with his father and}} health issues [...] "are serious episodes, but largely unrelated to the story. Coming so late in an otherwise light-hearted film, this tonal shift feels like a clumsy bid to add grit and gravitas." [...] Finally, he felt that Filmage failed to place the Descendents and All in a wider context, saying [...] "it feels limited in its lack of social or historical context beyond the band’s personal story, with almost zero examination of underground hardcore rock as a reaction against mainstream pop culture in Reagan-era America. Even if Descendents had little personal interest in the politics of punk, {{they were part of a}} wider movement that deserves a more searching film than this." [...] Postmedia News reviewer Jay Stone felt similarly about the segments focusing on Stevenson, remarking that while he [...] "emerges as the key character in Filmage" [...] and forms the film's human interest story, [...] "his personal history, including problems with a distant father and some health issues, is slipped so casually into Filmage that it takes a while <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>what</b> we’re seeing. Stevenson’s medical miracle is worth a movie of its own, but in the world of punk music documentaries, it’s just a sidebar." ...|$|E

Claire claims that hospital policy is forcing her not to help, but it's clear she is an uncaring person, nevertheless. The blind woman, Mrs. Reed, wants Claire to come visit her, but Claire is apprehensive and negative.
