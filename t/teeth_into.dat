[...] walks an unrelenting line — with ten versions of four songs ("Breathe" [...] clocks in with the highest total at four versions), there's not {{a lot of room for}} variation — and the repetition certainly makes for classic club fodder. This is the voice of the new Minogue doing dance as the faded remnants of the Stock, Aitken and Waterman patsy is left well and truly behind — she's now the voice behind the DJs — and there's plenty of their work on this double CD set to sink your <b>teeth</b> <b>into</b> [...] Hardcore Minogue fans with a good pair of dancing shoes may find this gyrating repetition worthwhile; general fans, however, may find the original Impossible Princess more accommodating.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers {{praised the}} film for being more subdued {{than most of}} Sci-Fi's gore-filled {{creature}} films and for its use of a live tiger rather than poor CGI effects. However, David Johnson of DVD Verdict, heavily criticized the film for [...] "its significant dearth of righteous tiger-attack action". He found the implied violence resulted in a boring film that will not satisfy more horror film buff: [...] "the gore-hounds that might be attracted to {{the promise of a}} big-ass tiger sinking his <b>teeth</b> <b>into</b> some hapless rednecks will be almost certainly disappointed. The big bummer is that we don't even get any tiger on human direct action until the very end, and that's boilerplate Lassie stuff with a stuntman fending off a laid-back stunt tiger". Conversely, unlike other reviewers, he praised the characters, feeling they were interesting and ended up being ones he [...] "somewhat cared about." ...|$|E

Thereafter, he did not spare the network: [...] "cliché succeeded to cliché"; [...] "a mentally defective aborigine who was deaf in both ears would have little difficulty in leaving 'Double Your Money' £32 richer than when he entered"; and after the network's first hundred days he attributed its viewing figures to the [...] "number of people who are sufficiently stupid to derive pleasure from such programmes".|$|E

[...] Sarah Hajibegari from The Times felt that while [...] "Hard Candy is no disaster", the album's producers have [...] "already done the same thing with Nelly Furtado, Britney Spears and Gwen Stefani."

500|$|The {{content of}} Illmatic is also {{informed}} by notions of artistic authenticity.

Rapper Common, describes in the preface to Born to Use Mics: Reading Nas's Illmatic the concerns that were felt by him and his contemporaries: “It was that serious for so many of us. We didn’t just grow up with hip hop; we grew up with hip-hop as hip-hop was also growing, and so that made for a very close and intimate relationship that was becoming more and more urgent – and we felt it.

The crash scenes were filmed on 6 March 2011 and aired on 14 April 2011. After these minor storylines, Joyner said that Fitzgerald should be involved in more complex storylines in 2012. She said, [...] "I think it's going to be an exciting year for Lorna. She's been a natural on the show ever since she was younger, and I think she's one of our best actresses.

500|$|Marc Buxton of Den of Geek {{scored the}} episode {{three out of}} five stars, calling it filler, but fun, and saying that the Ghost Rider prison {{sequence}} [...] "made the episode" [...] for him. Buxton said he [...] "digs" [...] the connections made between Mac and Civil War, but felt {{the end of that}} subplot with Simmons was confusing and could have been made clearer. Kevin Fitzpatrick of ScreenCrush said the series [...] "deserves some credit for venturing into" [...] the prison breakout trope, and thought the action sequences were impressive, but felt that Johnson's storyline was [...] "nowhere near as compelling as the series wants it to be" [...] and contrived, and said that the Mace/Simmons subplot was [...] "consistently dashing any energy or momentum built up from the prison scenes". Fitzpatrick also criticized the ghost effects. Collider's Evan Valentine gave the episode four stars out of five, indicating a [...] "very good" [...] episode, saying, [...] "When Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is at its best, it manages to find something interesting and worthwhile for each of its cast to dig their <b>teeth</b> <b>into,</b> and this episode {{is one of the most}} on-point examples of that we’ve seen this season."

500|$|The {{episode is}} one of the few in the series that has no paranormal {{elements}} to it.

It doesn't really have a paranormal aspect, except for Scully's perceptions of her deepest fears. I felt that I had to figure out what she is most afraid of, and she is most afraid of those things that most of us are afraid of. [...] The idea of dying at the hands of someone—creature or not—and she is helpless to do anything about it. I thought it was a very good way to explore Scully's character." [...] The scene where Dana Scully imagines Pfaster appearing as a devil was influenced by real-life accounts, as described by Carter: [...] "There are reports of people who had been under the spell of Jeffrey Dahmer, who actually claimed that he shape-shifted during those hours when they were held hostage; that his image actually changed." [...] Nutter said [...] "In many ways, Chris wanted to sell the idea that, as established in Mulder's closing dialogue in the show, not all terror comes from the paranormal. It could come from the person next door." ...|$|E
