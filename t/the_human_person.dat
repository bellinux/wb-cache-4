25|$|The act {{of killing}} oneself is not {{applicable}} to an omnipotent being, since, despite {{that such an}} act does involve some power, it also involves a lack of power: <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>person</b> who can kill himself is already not indestructible, and, in fact, every agent constituting his environment is more powerful in some ways than himself. In other words, all non-omnipotent agents are concretely synthetic: constructed as contingencies of other, smaller, agents, meaning that they, unlike an omnipotent agent, logically can exist not only in multiple instantiation (by being constructed out of the more basic agents they are made of), but are each bound to a different location in space contra transcendent omnipresence.|$|E

[...] On 16June1993 the Court of Vesoul, and on 24March1994 the [...] Court of Appeal of Besançon, sentenced the church to pay court costs and damages to the CCMM. In a second complaint filed on 27November, the CCMM and the Centre Information Jeunesse in Haute-Saône were sued after distributing a publication critical of the church. Both complaints were dismissed. In 1996, the two appeals for cassation filed {{by the church}} were rejected; the court held that the CCMM's writings did not fall under defamation, said that damages to the church's honor were not proven, that [...] "no reproach can be done when CCMM called 'cult' the Evangelical Church of Pentecost", and that the association [...] "merely assesses the nature and trends of a religious community, reports some of its practices, including those relating to the disease healing and its methods of recruitment through agencies providing relief without indicating that they are the community's emanations".|$|E

40|$|What is a <b>human</b> <b>person?</b> Two general {{accounts}} {{have been offered}} in answer to this question. According to <b>the</b> one, <b>human</b> <b>persons</b> are immaterial minds or souls. According to <b>the</b> other, <b>human</b> <b>persons</b> are identical with the material bodies that constitute them. Both accounts have serious problems. In this dissertation I present a position {{that is not a}} version of any of the currently fashionable or unfashionable 2 ̆ 2 isms 2 ̆ 2 [...] Cartesian dualism, reductive materialism or property dualism. Taking my lead from recent work on the constitution relation by Mark Johnston, E. J. Lowe, Michael Burke and David Wiggins, I argue in my dissertation for a constitution account of <b>human</b> <b>persons.</b> A constitution account of <b>human</b> <b>person</b> solves many of the problems that plague traditional dualist and materialist theories of persons {{while at the same time}} doing justice to our well founded intuitions about persons. According to <b>the</b> constitution view, <b>human</b> <b>persons</b> are concrete physical particulars numerically distinct from the concrete physical particulars that constitute them. Not only are the relata involved in the constitution relation [...] the constituting object and the constituted object [...] numerically distinct but they are also objects that fall under different sortals. The constitution view is not without costs. Perhaps the biggest is this: it entails that in the same region of space that presently contains my body there is another numerically distinct physical entity [...] Me [...] that shares with my body all of the same parts. This seems to raise insurmountable problems for the constitution view. I supply plausible solutions to these problems and show how the 2 ̆ 2 constitution 2 ̆ 2 view preserves our most deeply held and well-founded beliefs about persons. ...|$|R

2500|$|This approach, which derives {{its name}} from the Catholic University of Lublin in Poland where it is centered, is also {{sometimes}} called [...] "phenomenological Thomism."

40|$|The term {{person is}} usually used to {{indicate}} someone. This meaning {{is the result}} of a complex theoretical legacy, which, in many cases, derives from the use of the term person as nomen dignitatis. At the crossroads of theological, philosophical, juridical, and political debate, the concept of person, however, is likely to become equivocal. Specifically, to understand the ethical and anthropological controversy present in bioethics, we have distinguished the analogous concept of person, which can be predicated of several entities, from the univocal concept of <b>human</b> <b>person.</b> In everyday language, the term person already seems to indicate a human being, and therefore, it may seem redundant to write <b>the</b> term <b>human</b> <b>person.</b> In fact, as can be seen from the historical reconstruction, the very distinction between <b>person</b> and <b>human</b> <b>person</b> allows to identify and clarify the meaning of the current debate. <b>The</b> definition of <b>human</b> <b>person</b> extends to every human being at all existential stages: it implies that <b>the</b> <b>human</b> being is always someone. On the contrary, the notion of person indicates a series of qualities which when attributed to an entity make someone. Depending upon usage, the notion of person, in its semantic shifts, can therefore favor maximum inclusion or maximum discrimination between <b>human</b> beings. <b>The</b> debate is therefore open: to clarify the terms is indeed the first condition to promote dialogue and ethical discussion...|$|R

Regional human rights systems have applied additional human rights protections to their respective geographic regions. Both the international and regional systems have addressed <b>the</b> <b>human</b> rights of <b>persons</b> with mental disabilities through treaties, declarations, and thematic resolutions.

Further, the legal precedent and public pressure created by this body of international law has encouraged domestic governments to apply human rights principles to their policies affecting mentally disabled individuals at the national and sub-national level.
