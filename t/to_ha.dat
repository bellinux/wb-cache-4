Passenger traffic to Wopsononock had been declining, and coal traffic from Dougherty was rather limited. Shellenberger installed a rock crusher atop the mountain, which also provided revenue. A major forest fire destroyed both the Wopsononock Hotel and the coal tipple at Dougherty on April 30, 1903. When the railroad became insolvent again, Shellenberger was appointed receiver on June 4, 1909.

Over the next few decades, there were continuous attacks and counterattacks by both sides and Saigon changed hands frequently. Eventually, Nguyễn Ánh was forced him into exile. The Tây Sơn regularly raided the rice growing areas of the south during the harvesting season, confiscating the Nguyễns' supply of food.|$|E

In 1780, {{in an attempt}} to strengthen his political status, Nguyễn Ánh proclaimed himself Nguyễn vương (Nguyễn king or Nguyễn ruler in Vietnamese). Then, in 1781, Nguyễn Ánh sent further forces to support the Cambodian regime against Siamese armies who wanted to reassert their control. [...] Shortly thereafter, Nguyễn Ánh had Nhon brutally murdered. The reason remains unclear, but it was postulated that he did so because Nhon's fame and military success was overshadowing him. The Tây Sơn brothers reportedly celebrated on hearing of Nhon's execution, as he was the Nguyễn officer whom they most feared. Nhon's supporters rebelled, weakening the Nguyễn army, and within a few months, the Tây Sơn had recaptured Saigon mainly as a result of naval barrages. Nguyễn Ánh was forced to flee <b>to</b> <b>Ha</b> Tien, and then onto the island of Phú Quốc. Meanwhile, some of his forces continued to resist in his absence.|$|E
