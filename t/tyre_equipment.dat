40|$|Introducing loads {{onto the}} soil via {{pneumatic}} <b>tyred</b> <b>equipment</b> {{is the major}} cause of compaction of agricultural soils, which causes damage to the soil-water-air-plant system. The degree of soil compaction is largely influenced by the loads applied to the soil and resulting surface and subsurface pressure. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} in order to determine an effective method to measure the pressure distribution under a selection of pneumatic agricultural tyres on a hard surface and in the soil profile. As a result of this, it has been possible to evaluate the influence of tyre inflation pressure, load, ply rating and tread pattern on the resulting pressure. Also, the carcass stiffness of the tyres studied was determined and alternative methods to predict the carcass stiffness were evaluated and an improved technique was developed. Cont/d.

40|$|Compaction of {{farmland}} can {{in many cases}} be negative. A poorer water infiltration in the soil profile, bad conditions for root growth, slower decomposition rate of organic material, {{and an increase in}} traction power are some of the negative effects. The most serious compaction is the one appearing below the depth of tillage, as it will exist for many years. The factors having the greatest influence on the amount of soil compaction is the wheel load, the <b>tyre</b> <b>equipment</b> used, the tyre inflation pressure and the water content in the soil. Factors discussed in this report are wheel load, tyre inflation pressure, the stress in the soil, the stress distribution in the contact area and the impact of these parameters on the amount of compaction. Three different experiments were carried out on three sites in the autumn in 2002. The first experiment was carried out at Svenstorp farm in southern Sweden. During dry conditions the stress and the deformation in the soil was measured under a 3 -row, a 6 -row and a 9 -row sugar beet harvester that were driving with different loads. The 6 -row harvester was also driven with different tire inflation pressures. Saturated hydraulic conductivity, macroporosity and bulk density was measured in the topsoil after a single pass with the harvesters. The second experiment took place at Krenkerup farm in southern Denmark. Two different systems for sugar beet harvesting were evaluated. The first system contained one big harvester only that had a loading capacity of 28 tons and a total weight of 55 tons. Because of the great loading capacity, it was able to bring the sugar beets {{to the end of the}} field. The other system contained a smaller harvester, with a total weight of 27 tons and two field trailers that were supporting the harvester all the time. The measurements were concentrated on stress and deformation in the subsoil and also stress and stress distribution in the topsoil under the different tyres. The last experiment took place at Ultuna, Uppsala, Sweden. In this experiment the stress and the stress distribution in the topsoil was measured when driving with different wheel loads and tyre inflation pressures. The results from Svenstorp showed the positive effects of a reduced tyre inflation pressure on soil stress, saturated hydraulic conductivity and macro porosity in the topsoil. Traffic by the 6 -row harvester, driving with a high tyre inflation pressure, was resulting in the lowest rate of saturated hydraulic conductivity, independently of the load. Also the boogie wheels of the 3 - row harvester were resulting in low infiltration rates, independently of the load. The measurements at Krenkerup showed that one passage over the soil with the big harvester deformed the soil more at both 30 cm and 70 cm depth, than one passage with the small harvester followed by the field trailer. The highest stress both at 30 cm and 70 cm depth was measured under one of the three tyres of the big harvester. There was a very even stress distribution between the three axles of the field trailer. Measurements at Ultuna showed that a higher wheel load resulted in a higher stress in the topsoil, even though the tyre inflation pressure was kept constant. A lower tyre inflation pressure resulted in a more even stress distribution in the contact area. The main conclusions of this study are: 1) A reduced tyre inflation pressure will greatly reduce compaction of the topsoil. 2) The deformation in the soil was greater after passing once with a 55 ton harvester than after passing once with a 27 ton harvester plus a field trailer. 3) An increase in wheel load resulted in a higher stress in the topsoil, even though the tyre inflation pressure was kept the same...|$|E

This tyre is designed for both on- and off-road use and is commonly used on all wheel drive SUVs. Quasi-static laboratory and dynamic field tests were conducted to acquire parameterisation and validation test data for the FTire model. Quasi-static parameterisation tests include acquiring vertical tyre stiffness over a flat plate and cleats, tyre footprint sizes and shapes, longitudinal, lateral and torsional tyre stiffness for various tyre normal loads, as well as vibrational tyre responses. Dynamic parameterisation tests include dynamic cleat test data. An Adams model of the <b>tyre</b> testing <b>equipment</b> is implemented to simulate the FTire model and validate it against dynamic validation test results.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{simulate}} vehicle handling and roll over propensities, tyre characteristics {{in the form}} of side-force versus slip-angle curves, as well as suitable tyre models are required. For large tyres these characteristics are not readily available. Tyre manufacturers either do not have these characteristics, or do not openly publish them. Similarly, the majority of tyre models have been developed and validated for passenger car tyres and their applicability to large tyres are unknown. Furthermore the tests conducted to obtain passenger car tyre data cannot always be performed on large tyres. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure side-force versus slip-angle characteristics for two large tyres then use the data to parameterise existing tyre models and determine the accuracy of these models. The tyres of interest were the GoodYear Regional 385 / 65 R 22. 5 tyre, which is a typical truck tyre, and a Michelin 16. 00 R 20 XZL, which is a tyre typically used on military vehicles. In order to measure these characteristics, existing <b>tyre</b> testing <b>equipment</b> {{in the form of}} a tyre test trailer had to be revived, as it had not been used in the past 10 years. The confidence in the equipment was therefore so low that extensive verification tests had to be conducted to develop sufficient confidence in the equipment, to be able to perform these tests and obtain accurate data. In line with this objective, it was envisaged to create a commercial business opportunity for tyre testing utilising the revived equipment, as there is a huge international requirement for data on these <b>tyres.</b> The above <b>equipment</b> revival was conducted successfully, and the tyre tests were performed at Gerotek Test Facilities. Successful steady state side-force versus slip-angle characteristic tests were performed, and a dynamic double lane change test was performed, and used to validate models. From the side-force versus slip-angle characteristic data three existing tyre models were parameterised namely, Fiala, UA (University of Arizona) and Pacejka 89 tyre models, as implemented in ADAMS View software. In order to validate these models, an ADAMS model of the Tyre Tester was developed incorporating physical measured parameters, such as the geometry, mass, centre of mass and moments of inertia. Correlation between the simulated data of the tyre models and the measured track data was evaluated. The correlation showed that the Pacejka 89 tyre model provided the closest fit for the side-force versus slip angle tests, of all three tyre models. The Pacejka 89 tyre model also showed good correlation on the dynamic double lane change tests.

40|$|Tyre {{modelling}} {{has been}} a focal point of vehicle dynamics modelling {{since the beginning of}} vehicle dynamics research. Many tyre models are based on single point contact models which utilize some form of the Pacejka Magic Formula curve fit. The Pacejka Magic Formula approach was formulated in the 1980 s and has certain advantages such as high computational efficiency and easily obtainable parameterization data. However, the Pacejka Magic Formula is limited to function on smooth roads and a finite number of well defined, long wavelength discrete obstacles. A high fidelity approach in the form of Cosin s FTire tyre model was developed, in which the tyre is modelled as a three dimensional object populated with bending, tangential, lateral and radial stiffnesses as well as damping. The tyre is numerically approximated with a predetermined number of elements. The disadvantages of using FTire include its low computational efficiency and the large number of parameters prescribed to parameterize the tyre model. However, FTire is claimed to be capable of accurately predicting the forces and moments generated by the tyre on smooth as well as uneven road surfaces for on-road tyres. The focus of this study lies on parameterizing and validating an FTire model of an all-terrain SUV tyre. The aim is to verify whether a parameterized FTire model is able to predict the tyre behaviour of an all-terrain SUV tyre for lateral and longitudinal forces on smooth road surfaces and vertical forces on uneven but hard terrain. Static laboratory and dynamic field tests are conducted to acquire parameterization and validation test data to parameterize the FTire model. An Adams model of the <b>tyre</b> testing <b>equipment</b> is implemented to simulate the FTire model and validate it against dynamic validation test results.

40|$|M. B. A. - WBSThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to establish the impact of brand equity and product augmentation on purchase decisions involving industrial commodities. The field of investigation was that of industrial tyres in the South African open cast mining industry and the sample was extracted from buying centre members who purchased <b>tyres</b> for earthmoving <b>equipment</b> for use on coal mines in the Mpumalanga Province of South Africa. Literature pertaining to commodity products, brand concepts and consumer brands forms the basis of the literature review; whereafter specific study on industrial branding and the buying centre were explored. The research method used was a conjoint analysis experiment which was constructed following a series of pilot studies to determine the key factors in industrial tyre procurement. The findings were that brand was indeed considered of primary importance in tyre procurement, demonstrated by each buying centres' willingness to pay a premium price for their preferred brand of tyre. Product durability and price were second and third in importance respectively. The augmented product attributes of delivery lead time and technical support were considered least important of the five attributes. These results have important implications for mining company procurement departments as well as tyre suppliers. Mining companies may be paying premium prices for tyres which are a considerable cost element in running expenses for heavy machinery. On the other hand, well known tyre supply companies may be able to expand their market share and improve profitability through the use of this information...|$|R
40|$|The racing {{situation}} {{requires a}} high performance tuned vehicle incorporating a high performance engine, aerodynamic body, and tyres. Among these three important factors the tyre {{is the only}} component which can transmit the vehicle force to the road, and {{is the most difficult}} part to tune, since it involves complex phenomena and a wide range of operating conditions. Development of a theoretical tyre model is necessitated to predict the tyre forces and moments according to various road conditions. Many empirical tyre models have been studied in the past as it is efficient to conduct experimental curve-fittings. However, these carry inherent problems from the unrealistic <b>tyre</b> testing <b>equipment</b> and conditions. On the other hand, the theoretical tyre model can purely simulate and make predictions taking into account the causes and effects of the tyre operating phenomena. Therefore, it can enhance the accuracy of the tuning and selection of the tyre. The aim of this research project was to provide an understanding of tread friction interacting with the road surface in various operating conditions in order to enhance the knowledge about the application to theoretical tyre model development. The approaches employed to achieve the research aim mainly involve experimental investigations and numerical simulations including the development and application of Gaussian/non-Gaussian surfaces at the contact interface in order to predict frictional behaviours of tread in a realistic way. The review and analyses of the literature involving the empirical and theoretical research field of tyres revealed that existing information regarding the effects on the complex interactions between tyre operating variables was found to be sparse and only qualitative. Recently, a great deal of improvement of theoretical tyre models has been made with innovative representation of road surface asperities. However, this surface model employs only a few simple shapes to represent the road asperity shapes. This should be further improved with inclusion of a greater variety of shapes. Currently the simulation software packages used for the tyre forces and moments prediction are mostly multi-body physics software packages such as MSC. ADAMS for the computing efficiency. In order to maximise the accuracy and evaluate the interaction phenomena in detail, FEA can be utilized. In order to evaluate the effects of important operating variables on frictional behaviours of tread, the main parts of the model: tread material properties and the surface roughness representations, were developed. Each part of the model was investigated separately and then applied to the model. Equivalent Gaussian/non-Gaussian surfaces were generated using the same roughness parameters, in order to assess the effects of these parameters on the friction corresponding to a given roughness. The friction tests were conducted with a unique testing apparatus and the experimental rig was designed based upon piezo-electric load cells such that the road surface was sliding over the tread rubber sheet. The experimental schedule was conceived with the aim of making consistent measurements in order to examine the data with respect to the causes and effects of the four individual experimental variables: tread compound, surface roughness, sliding velocity, and normal load. The experimental data were expressed in terms of the average friction coefficients over the sliding motion. The important model parameters which control the frictional behaviours were determined by a trial and error method to give a match between the friction test results and their simulation results. These parameters were the local friction coefficient corresponding to the effect of the microscopic texture of the contact bodies and the friction stress limit, which represents the limiting shear stress during friction. Comparisons were conducted to verify the validity of the FE models for the predictions with different conditions. Lastly, the prediction of friction for the load controlled (LC) mode, which is a more realistic tyre contact condition, was conducted, with the important model parameters obtained by comparison between the experimental results and their simulations. The effects of each variable on the friction of the tread was discussed in conjunction with the interaction of the operating variables. The conclusions derived from the research conducted to achieve each of these specific aims are summarised separately. These analyses led to the confirmation of the general and specific trends of the friction in contact between tyre tread and road surface. Specifically, the successful applications of the Gaussian/non-Gaussian surfaces enabled a discussion of the effects of each roughness parameters on tread friction. It has been revealed that not only the effects of the relative roughness could cause the variations in the apparent friction coefficient, but also more significantly the skewness and kurtosis could have the effects on the frictional behaviours of tread rubber, and should thus always be included in simulated surfaces. It has been verified that the FE model of the tread-road interaction as a tool to investigate the causes and effects of the operating variables can be used to predict the detailed interaction of the tread rubber and road asperities...|$|R
