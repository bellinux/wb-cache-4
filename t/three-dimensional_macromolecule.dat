For example, softwood lignin is primarily composed of coniferyl alcohol with trace amounts of p-coumaryl alcohol, whereas hardwood lignin is made of coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols with trace amounts of p-coumaryl alcohol. Furthermore, grass lignin is composed of p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} years chemists {{have been able}} to {{synthesize}} new complex molecules, and to control their macromolecular and supramolecular architechture. These efforts have led to the transition in molecular scale from the picometer to the nanometer scale. Among these new macromolecular structures, dendrimers have received increasing interest. Dendrimers are highly branched, <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>macromolecules</b> with branch points at every monomer, leading to a structure that has essentially as many end-groups as monomeric units. Among their most important properties are the molecular shape and size persistence along with their narrow molecular weight distribution. The synthesis of dendrimers starts by the addition of building units to a polyfunctional molecule which represents the core of the future dendrimer. The resulting molecule is the first generation (G 1) of the dendrimer. Each newly generated branch is the starting point for several further sub-branches that will form second (G 2) and higher generations of the dendrimer.

Despite exhibiting a very high molecular weight, CCS polymers display solubility and viscosity parameters similar to linear and branched polymers of low molecular weight [1]. Despite the wide scale academic and industrial attention star polymers have received, practically no research has been performed regarding structural relaxation, physical ageing, glass transition or thermal expansion properties of CCS polymers and/or blends with linear polymers. These properties can be influenced by fillers and crosslinks, due to the restraints on molecular segmental motion that they impart. CCS polymers can behave in a similar manner, where the arms on the hyperbranched particles can interweave throughout the chains of the matrix polymer. The advantage of CCS-polymer fillers over other types of filler/crosslink is the excellent compatibility and interfacial interaction which occurs, in particular when the polymer matrix and the arms on the CCS polymer are the same material...|$|R
40|$|Star {{polymers}} are {{one example}} of <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>macromolecules</b> containing several arms with similar molecular weight connected to a central core. Due to their compact structure and their enhanced segment density in comparison to linear polymers of the same molecular weight, they have attracted significant attention during recent years. The preparation of block-arm star copolymers with a permanently hydrophilic block and an “environmentally” sensitive block, which can change its nature from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, leads to nanometer-sized responsive materials with unique properties. These polymers are able to undergo a conformational change or phase transition as a reply to an external stimulus resulting {{in the formation of}} core–shell nanoparticles, which further tend to aggregate. Star-shaped copolymers with different cores were synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The core-first method chosen as synthetic strategy allows good control over the polymer architecture. First of all the multifunctional initiators were prepared by esterification reaction of the hydroxyl groups with 2 -chloropropionyl chloride. Using β-cyclodextrin as core molecules, which possess a well-defined number of functional groups up to 21, allows defining the number of arms per star polymer. In order to prepare stimuli-responsive multi-arm copolymers, containing a stimuli-responsive (poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm)) and a non-responsive block (poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMAAm)), consecutive ATRP was carried out.

30|$|In general, {{cellulose}} microfibrils are {{the main}} contributor to the mechanical properties of wood cell walls because of their highly crystalline structure. The spatial angle between cellulose microfibrils and the longitudinal axis, i.e., the microfibril angle (MFA), of the middle layer of the secondary wall is important in determining the mechanical and physical properties of wood fibers [1, 3 – 6]. Hemicellulose is a non-crystalline polysaccharide distributed inhomogeneously in cell walls. Hemicellulose is bound to cellulose and lignin by hydrogen and covalent bonds, respectively [7, 8]. Consequently, hemicellulose is essential for maintaining cell wall assembly. Hemicellulose controls cellulose microfibril aggregation and {{the distance between them}} [9]. Lignin is an isotropic <b>three-dimensional</b> (3 D) <b>macromolecule</b> that forms bead-like modules in the hemicellulose gel that fills the space between cellulose microfibrils [10].

In this chapter, metallodendrimers are discussed in which the metals are essential for maintaining the dendritic structure.

40|$|Dendrimers are <b>three-dimensional,</b> hyperbranched <b>macromolecules</b> that {{possess a}} uniform size and shape. Most {{dendrimer}}s are spherical in shape; however, {{the shape of}} the dendrimer can be adjusting using the number and the position of the branching groups in the core. For example, dendritic rods have been prepared by assembling a dendron around each repeat unit of a linear polymer core, and hybrid-linear dendritic diblock copolymers have been prepared by attaching a dendron to the end functional group of a linear polymer. This linear block in the diblock copolymers also adds physical integrity and an assembly mechanism for arrangement of the polymer. Nonetheless, no one has combined the unique shape of the dendritic rod with that of the linear dendritic diblock copolymer. The objective of this research was to prepare a linear-dendritic rod diblock copolymer, and to examine its assembly behavior in solution, at the air/water interface, and in the bulk. These polymers consisted of a linear poly(ethylene oxide) -poly(ethylene imine) diblock copolymer around which poly(amido amine) branches were divergently synthesized. The dendritic branches were terminated with amine and ester groups, as well as alkyl chains of various lengths in order to "tune" the amphiphilic nature of the polymer. (cont.) A fundamental change in the assembly behavior of the polymers was observed at generation 4. 0 (eight end-groups). In solution, the hydrodynamic and viscometric radii were found to increase to a much greater extent than expected for the generation 4. 0 and 4. 5 polymers, consistent with a breakdown of the spherical approximation as the dendritic block extended into a rod-like shape. Similarly, at the air/water interface, the dendritic block of generation 4. 0 -alkyl terminated polymers all adopted a horizontal rod configuration, while the dendritic block of the lower generation polymers took on a random coil configuration, whose shape depended on the length of the terminal alkyl groups as well as the generation number of the dendritic block. Finally, in the bulk, direct observation of the generation 4. 0 -dodecyl terminated polymer with TEM indicated that the polymer was adopting a rod- or worm-like conformation, while the lower generation polymers only exhibited traditional diblock copolymer or polymer brush behavior. by Catherine Marie Bambenek Santini.

Hence, the lignin's physical and chemical behavior will be different with respect to the original source and extraction method used.

Exact determination of direct inter-actions between the macromolecules and the solvent molecules still remains a very hard mathematical and computational problem. For this reason di®erent kinds of approxima-tions are usually done which allow description of these extremely complicated interactions through physically averaged macroscopic parameters. Such e®ective parameters include, for example, solvent accessible area of the solute molecule (in the calculation of thermo-dynamic properties and <b>three-dimensional</b> structure of <b>macromolecules)</b> and the so called excluded volume (see Figure 1). Computation of these parameters requires evaluation of complicated algorithms. For this reason, any e®ort to development an e®ective analytical methods is always welcome.

40|$|The <b>three-dimensional</b> {{structures}} of <b>macromolecules</b> and their complexes are mainly elucidated by X-ray protein crystallography. A major {{limitation of this}} method is access to high-quality crystals, which is necessary to ensure X-ray diffraction extends to sufficiently large scattering angles and hence yields information of sufficiently high resolution with which to solve the crystal structure. The observation that crystals with reduced unit-cell volumes and tighter macromolecular packing often produce higher-resolution Bragg peaks suggests that crystallographic resolution for some macromolecules may be limited not by their heterogeneity, but by a deviation of strict positional ordering of the crystalline lattice. Such displacements of molecules from the ideal lattice {{give rise to a}} continuous diffraction pattern that is equal to the incoherent sum of diffraction from rigid individual molecular complexes aligned along several discrete crystallographic orientations and that, consequently, contains more information than Bragg peaks alone. Although such continuous diffraction patterns have long been observed—and are of interest as a source of information about the dynamics of proteins—they have not been used for structure determination. Here we show for crystals of the integral membrane protein complex photosystem II that lattice disorder increases the information content and the resolution of the diffraction pattern well beyond the 4. 5 A limit of measurable Bragg peaks, which allows us to phase the pattern directly. Using the molecular envelope conventionally determined at 4. 5 A as a constraint, we obtain a static image of the photosystem II dimer at a resolution of 3. 5 A. This result shows that continuous diffraction can be used to overcome what have long been supposed to be the resolution limits of macromolecular crystallography, using a method that exploits commonly encountered imperfect crystals and enables model-free phasing...|$|R

Both their chemistry and size (in the range about ~ 1 - ~ 10 nm) are precisely tailorable and some dendrimers are known to readily form monolayers on technologically useful substrates. For these reasons they are of interest both scientifically and practically in the context of nanostructure and ultra-thin film studies. This dissertation focuses on three interrelated issues: 1) interfacial interactions (the role of dendrimer monolayers in mediating the properties of subsequently deposit thin films), 2) submonolayer dendrimer domain formation, and, 3) physical intermixing between dendrimer domains and metal overlayers. In the dendrimer mediation section, the effects of dendrimer monolayers on thin metal overlayers, subsequently deposited by physical vapor deposition, are studied focusing on tribomechanical behavior and molecule-metal reactions. Dendrimer monolayer mediation of Cu and Cr overlayer films is found to dramatically influence nanoscratch mechanisms in these systems. Physical intermixing of metal atoms with dendrimer molecules to form a nanocomposite with distinct properties (rather than chemical interaction, grain size effects, etc.) is proposed as the probable explanation for these observations. In the domain formation section, a simple aerosol spray process is developed and used to prepare thin dendrimer-containing liquid layers from which submonolayer dendrimer domains form during the evaporation of solvent. An understanding of the relevant physical interactions (e. g., dewetting, boundary energy, long-range repulsion, dendrimer-substrate and dendrimer-dendrimer bonding, domain thermal stability, etc.) which control the form and coverage-dependent evolution of experimentally observed domains is developed. The importance of electrostatic interaction revealed in this section motivated a study of charge patterning by scanning probe microscopy methods in granular materials (Appendix A). Finally, submonolayer dendrimer domain patterns with uniform monolayer thickness are used as heterogeneous substrates for the deposition of Au overlayers. Direct evidence is found for the extent and type of physical intermixing of non-reaction Au with dendrimer monolayer domains by atomic force microscopy based step-height and force measurements as a function of Au thicknesses...|$|R
