The island {{became a part}} of the Roman Republic in 133 BC, when Attalus III, the king of Pergamon, died, leaving his territory to the Romans. The Romans constructed a new port at Alexandreia Troas, on the Dardanelle Strait. This led to Tenedos's decline. Tenedos lost its importance during this period. Virgil, in Aeneid, stated the harbour was deserted and ships could not moor in the bay during his <b>time.</b> <b>Processing</b> of grapes seems to have been abandoned. Olive cultivation and processing did possibly continue, though there was likely no surplus to export.

Several robot cities have been planned for the country: the first will be built in 2016 at a cost of 500 billion won (440 million USD), of which 50 billion is direct government investment. The new robot city will feature research and development centers for manufacturers and part suppliers, as well as exhibition halls and a stadium for robot competitions. The country's new Robotics Ethics Charter will establish ground rules and laws for human interaction with robots in the future, setting standards for robotics users and manufacturers, as well as guidelines on ethical standards to be programmed into robots to prevent human abuse of robots and vice versa.|$|E

40|$|Most {{classical}} scheduling models assume fixed <b>processing</b> <b>times</b> for the jobs. However, in real-life applications the <b>processing</b> <b>time</b> {{of a job}} often {{depends on}} the amount of resources such as facilities, manpower, funds, etc. allocated to it, and so the <b>processing</b> <b>time</b> can be reduced when additional resources are given to the job. This speed up of the <b>processing</b> <b>time</b> of a job comes at a certain cost. A scheduling problem in which the <b>processing</b> <b>times</b> of the jobs can be reduced at some expense is called a scheduling problem with controllable <b>processing</b> <b>times.</b> We contribute by presenting new approximation algorithms for this kind of problems. We consider the problem of scheduling n independent jobs on m identical machines that operate in parallel. Each job has a controllable <b>processing</b> <b>time.</b> The fact that the jobs have a controllable <b>processing</b> <b>time</b> means that it is allowed to compress (a part of) the <b>processing</b> <b>time</b> of the job, in return for compression cost. We present the first known polynomial time approximation schemes for the non-preemptive case of several identical parallel machines scheduling problems with controllable <b>processing</b> <b>times.</b> Moreover, we study the problem when preemption is allowed and describe efficient exact and approximation algorithms. ...|$|R

40|$|We study {{a problem}} of {{scheduling}} n jobs on a single machine in batches. A batch {{is a set of}} jobs processed contiguously and completed together when the processing of all jobs in the batch is finished. Processing of a batch requires a machine setup time dependent on the position of this batch in the sequence. Setup <b>times</b> and job <b>processing</b> <b>times</b> are continuously controllable, that is, they are real-valued variables within their lower and upper bounds. A deviation of a setup <b>time</b> or job <b>processing</b> <b>time</b> from its upper bound is called a compression. The problem is to find a job sequence, its partition into batches, and the values for setup <b>times</b> and job <b>processing</b> <b>times</b> such that (a) total job completion time is minimized, subject to an upper bound on total weighted setup <b>time</b> and job <b>processing</b> <b>time</b> compression, or (b) a linear combination of total job completion time, total setup time compression, and total job <b>processing</b> <b>time</b> compression is minimized. Properties of optimal solutions are established.
