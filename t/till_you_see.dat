500|$|Todd {{found the}} pack's {{difficulty}} to be [...] "wildly careening" [...] and stated, [...] "Some battles are amazingly easy. You can soar through many scraps in moments, with your party carving up the opposition {{before you can}} tell if you're fighting a mummy or a zombie. However, others are absolutely brutal ... There {{are more than a}} couple of moments in the game in which your party is ambushed by enemy spellcasters that rip you to pieces before you can even think about a proper response." [...] He praised the game's music as blending in seamlessly with that of the original game, but criticized it for having a minimal amount of voice acting, with sequences of dialogue that begin with audio and transition into text. Steve Butts commented on this, saying, [...] "the dialogue here really needs some work ... you'll even be treated to some truly tortured sentences. 'Wait <b>till</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> how deep into the backside of evil I insert my boot in the name of justice!' is probably my favorite. It's too bad there's not more voice acting in the game, because hearing someone speak lines like that out loud may have given the developers an opportunity to edit some of the worst offenders." ...|$|E
500|$|The Ramones' {{debut album}} had an outsized effect {{relative}} to its modest sales. According to Generation X bassist Tony James, [...] "Everybody went up three gears {{the day they}} got that first Ramones album. Punk rock—that rama-lama super fast stuff—is totally down to the Ramones. Bands were just playing in an MC5 groove until then." [...] The Ramones' two July 1976 shows, like their debut album, are seen as having {{a significant impact on}} the style of many of the newly formed British punk acts—as one observer put it, [...] "instantly nearly every band speeded up". The Ramones' first British concert, at London's Roundhouse concert hall, was held on July 4, 1976, the United States Bicentennial. The Sex Pistols were playing in Sheffield that evening, supported by the Clash, making their public debut. The next night, members of both bands attended the Ramones' gig at the Dingwall's club. Ramones manager Danny Fields recalls a conversation between Johnny Ramone and Clash bassist Paul Simonon (which he mislocates at the Roundhouse): [...] "Johnny asked him, 'What do you do? Are you in a band?' Paul said, 'Well, we just rehearse. We call ourselves the Clash but we're not good enough.' Johnny said, 'Wait <b>till</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> us—we stink, we're lousy, we can't play. Just get out there and do it.'" [...] Another band whose members saw the Ramones perform, the Damned, played their first show two days later. The central fanzine of the early UK punk scene, Sniffin' Glue, was named after the song [...] "Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue", which appeared on the debut LP.|$|E
500|$|Mars {{had been}} filming the music video for [...] "Gorilla" [...] as he {{announced}} on his Twitter account, on October 2, 2013. He said [...] "Sorry i've been M.I.A, I was shooting a music video. #WinkWink #FRIKIKIKIKI #BangBang Wait <b>till</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> this". It {{was directed by}} Mars' himself and regular collaborator Cameron Duddy. On October 10, 2013 it was announced on Bruno Mars' official website, {{leading up to the}} release of the video, the unveil of teasers every day via Mars' Instagram account. The teasers included a car parked in front of a strip club, a reptile, and an angry boss played by Luis Guzmán. Duddy along with Mars sought to create [...] "more than a standard strip-club video" [...] by researching and going into strip clubs to appreciate the architecture of the local. Nevertheless, the search for the ideal strip club was fruitless, so Mars and Duddy decided to build one: [...] "a joint that seemed like it was lifted straight out of Havana, dark and sweaty and seemingly untouched by time. They painted the walls themselves, and went back and forth on just what color neon they should use". When the time came to cast someone to play a stripper, the only name was Freida Pinto's one. However, Duddy had some doubts her choice, since he considered her [...] "safe". To this, Mars replied [...] "it's important to use someone who hasn't been seen in this light before". All in all, Duddy confessed that he trusted Mars instincts regarding Pinto's choice for the role. Duddy explained that some scenes recorded for the video were dangerous. Pinto could have harmed herself in the scene where [...] "she sheds her clothes among a sea of sparks", as well as Mars' guitar player [...] "He got dangerously close to having his head burned". Muriel Villera starts as one of the jealous strippers. The official music video was set to premiere on October 14, 2013. Nevertheless, its release was delayed one day by Mars himself stating [...] "I want it to be the best it can be. With that being said, I need one more day". The video, finally arrived on October 15, 2013 exclusively via Facebook.|$|E
