5|$|The Green is not {{perfectly}} rectangular, as {{its southern}} border along Wheelock Street runs {{slightly to the}} northeast rather than due east-west. This irregularity {{is due to the}} Town of Hanover's 1873 seizure of part of the southeast corner of the Green, which it used <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> Wheelock Street. The Green had previously extended 30 feet (nine meters) farther south on that corner.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, {{there was}} serious {{flooding}} in Salford, {{caused by a}} bottleneck at {{a bend in the}} river at Strangeways, on the border with Manchester. Flooding had been a problem for hundreds of years, and, in 1946, the decision was made <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> and widen the river to increase its capacity. Work started in 1951 {{but it was not until}} September 1970 that water first flowed through the Anaconda Cut. The total cost of the project was £2m.|$|E
5|$|M-204 runs {{across the}} Leelanau Peninsula between Leland and Suttons Bay {{in the northwestern}} Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. The {{trunkline}} runs through a rural section of Leelanau County, connecting two villages with the county seat. Originally a gravel road in 1933, it was later paved within {{the first three years}} of existence. Segments were realigned <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> curves in the late 1930s and early 1970s near the villages of Lake Leelanau and Suttons Bay.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{building}} of the canal, navigation between the towns of Bridgwater and Taunton was possible by using the River Parrett and the River Tone. The Tone had been improved by its Conservators, who had obtained Acts of Parliament in 1699 and 1707, which had allowed them <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> and dredge the river and parts of the Parrett, and to build locks and half-locks to manage the water levels. The initial work was completed by 1717, although further improvements including more locks continued to be made until the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Swiss {{publisher}} Faksimile-Verlag Luzern requested {{permission to}} produce a full-colour facsimile of the book. Permission was initially denied, because Trinity College officials felt {{that the risk of}} damage to the book was too high. By 1986, Faksimile-Verlag had developed a process that used gentle suction <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> a page so that it could be photographed without touching it and so won permission to publish a new facsimile. After each page was photographed, a single-page facsimile was prepared so the colours could be carefully compared to the original and adjustments made where necessary. The completed work was published in 1990 in a two-volume set containing the full facsimile and scholarly commentary. One copy is held by the Anglican Church in Kells, {{on the site of the}} original monastery.|$|E
5|$|M-33 was {{designated}} by 1919 along {{a section of}} the current highway between Mio and Atlanta. The highway also included roadway segments south of Mio that are now parts of other trunklines. The portion south of Mio was rerouted in the mid-1920s, transferring sections to M-72 in the process. The state started extending M-33 in both directions in 1930s. The current highway segment between Onaway and Cheboygan was the former route of US Highway 23 (US23) until 1940 when the latter highway was realigned onto an alignment that runs along Lake Huron. Several minor changes have been made to M-33's routing since the 1950s <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> out curves or finish paving the highway.|$|E

5|$|Task Force Katrina Commander Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honore {{also charged}} the paratroopers <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> out the {{evacuation}} situations at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, the New Orleans Convention Center and the Superdome. In all, 3,600 of the division's paratroopers were deployed to New Orleans {{to participate in}} Task Force All-American. The unit worked in tandem with state, local and other federal authorities to feed, process and transport evacuees to other accommodations; the division's soldiers helped evacuate 6,000 New Orleans residents. By September 18, the 82nd Division medical personnel had treated 1,352people and given 2,047 immunizations, according to unit documents. By September 19, 82nd Division military engineers had cleared 185 city blocks of debris, cleared 113 streets, and removed 218 trees, according to unit documents.|$|E
5|$|At 0415 on 25 June, the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division {{supported}} by the 8th Armoured Brigade and 250 guns, began Operation Martlet against the junction of the Panzer Lehr and 12th SS Panzer divisions. The first objective, Fontenay-le-Pesnel was fought over all day but stubborn German resistance prevented its capture. An infantry battalion {{supported by}} tanks, advanced around the village {{to the west and}} took Tessel Wood, where they received several German counter-attacks, which were repulsed by British artillery fire and close air support. By nightfall, the 49th Division had failed to reach the Rauray leaving the terrain dominating the right flank of VIII Corps in German hands. Martlet forced the I SS Panzer Corps to commit the remaining tanks of the 12th SS Panzer Division against the XXX Corps front, for a counter-attack the following day. During the night, the Germans in Fontenay-le-Pesnel withdrew <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> the front line and infantry from the 49th Division secured the village before dawn.|$|E
5|$|The {{entirety}} of NY448 was originally designated {{as part of}} NY117 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. In 193233, John D. Rockefeller offered <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> a short section of NY117 that passed through Kykuit, the Rockefeller family estate, citing safety concerns. The state expressed similar sentiments in 1949, deeming the stretch unsafe for commercial traffic. By the 1960s, the annual average daily traffic count along NY117 had grown to 5,000 vehicles per day, {{far more than the}} 1,800 that the road had originally been built to serve. This led the New York State Legislature to approve plans for a new alignment for NY117 in 1965. The new road would be located north of the existing road, relieving traffic congestion on the Albany Post Road (US9) and NY117 and providing access to NY9A, US9, the Taconic State Parkway and the proposed Hudson River Expressway in the North Tarrytown area.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the eight}} legs of a spider {{consists}} of seven distinct parts. The part closest to and attaching the leg to the cephalothorax is the coxa; the next segment is the short trochanter that works as a hinge for the following long segment, the femur; next is the spider's knee, the patella, which acts as the hinge for the tibia; the metatarsus is next, and it connects the tibia to the tarsus (which may {{be thought of as}} a foot of sorts); the tarsus ends in a claw made up of either two or three points, depending on the family to which the spider belongs. Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, spiders and a few other groups still use hydraulic pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. The only extensor muscles in spider legs are located in the three hip joints (bordering the coxa and the trochanter). As a result, a spider with a punctured cephalothorax cannot extend its legs, and the legs of dead spiders curl up. Spiders can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level to extend their legs, and jumping spiders can jump up to 50 times their own length by suddenly increasing the blood pressure in the third or fourth pair of legs. Although larger spiders use hydraulics <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> their legs, unlike smaller jumping spiders they depend on their flexor muscles to generate the propulsive force for their jumps.|$|E
5|$|Kurt Busch's right-front tire exploded, {{causing him}} to hit the wall between turns three and four, and the tenth caution was shown on lap 256. Kurt Busch retired from the race because of his crash. He was transported to the infield medical center for a {{mandatory}} check-up. Edwards remained in the lead for the lap-262 restart. Earnhardt spun his tires, forcing Kenseth onto the outside lane and Gordon to the inside where he passed Earnhardt. Kenseth moved in front of Earnhardt and then made contact with Gordon, who was sent into the inside backstretch retaining wall, which had no SAFER barrier installed. Gordon's car's radiator flew out from its chassis and {{into the path of}} oncoming traffic. Kenseth slid but was able <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> his car and continue. The final caution was initially waved before a red-flag was shown, which stopped the race to allow officials to remove debris from the track. The race resumed 17 minutes later, with Edwards leading Earnhardt and Biffle. Edwards maintained the lead for the remaining two laps to secure his second consecutive win and the ninth of his career. Earnhardt finished second, ahead of Biffle in third place, Harvick in fourth, and Burton in fifth. Ragan, Kahne, Kvapil, Hamlin, and Martin rounded out the top ten finishers. The race had eleven cautions and nineteen lead changes among nine drivers. Edwards led four times for a total of 86 laps, more than any other competitor.|$|E

30|$|The {{stabilization}} {{procedure was}} used {{regardless of the}} extent of scoliosis deformity or pelvic obliquity. However, the scoliosis and pelvic obliquity were always improved in the operated patients as a result of (1) the intra-operative prone position, (2) specific attention <b>to</b> <b>straightening</b> the spine and pelvis with positioning on the scoliosis frame before starting surgery, (3) the primary thoracolumbar scoliosis correction that occurred with rod, hook, and sublaminar wire instrumentation, and (4) the passive pelvic correction that accompanied the lumbar straightening.|$|R
25|$|Yield {{strength}} {{is the critical}} material property exploited by many fundamental techniques of material-working: to reshape material with pressure (such as forging, rolling, pressing, or hydroforming), to separate material by cutting (such as machining) or shearing, and to join components rigidly with fasteners. Yield load can be taken as the load applied to the centre of a carriage spring <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> its leaves.|$|E
