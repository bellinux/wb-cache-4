50|$|In some applications, {{a single}} acting <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinder</b> is {{adequate}} {{to accomplish the}} work except for one stage that is required to be double acting.|$|E
50|$|A {{common form}} {{is made of}} {{concentric}} tubes of approximately equal length that extend and retract like sleeves, one inside the other, such as the <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|E
50|$|The lorry {{models were}} {{available}} with a hydraulic tipper. The <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinder</b> is located between {{the cabin and}} tipper and used by a multi-piston pump, operated by PTO on gearbox.|$|E
50|$|<b>Telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{are also}} {{referred}} to as telescoping <b>cylinders</b> and multi-stage <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} a {{hydraulic}} cylinder is the total of the stroke, {{the thickness of the}} piston, the thickness of bottom and head and the length of the connections. Often this length does not fit in the machine. In that case the piston rod is also used as a piston barrel and a second piston rod is used. These kinds of <b>cylinders</b> are called <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders.</b> If we call a normal rod <b>cylinder</b> single stage, <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> are multi-stage units of two, three, four, five or more stages. In general <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> are much more expensive than normal <b>cylinders.</b> Most <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> are single acting (push). Double acting <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> must be specially designed and manufactured.|$|R
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 2: Basic design {{types of}} <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> ...|$|R
50|$|In {{some special}} applications, a <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinder</b> is {{required}} to extend with a constant force or constant speed. To accomplish this the cylinder is designed {{so that all the}} stages extend at the same time. This can also be accomplished in a double acting design by matching the extension and retraction areas of the pistons on all the stages.|$|E
50|$|Another {{problem can}} occur if a double acting <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{encounters}} a load that pulls on the actuator during extension {{such as when}} a tilting load goes over center and opens the cylinder beyond the internal volume of the hydraulic oil. When the piston face catches up again and strikes the oil column a pressure spike occurs which can damage the actuator.|$|E
5000|$|Telescopic {{cylinders}} are {{a special}} {{design of a}} hydraulic cylinder or pneumatic cylinder which provide an exceptionally long output travel from a very compact retracted length. Typically the collapsed length of a <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinder</b> is 20 to 40%of the fully extended length depending {{on the number of}} stages. Some pneumatic telescoping units are manufactured with retracted lengths of under 15% of overall extended unit length. [...] This feature is very attractive to machine design engineers when a conventional single stage rod style actuator will not fit in an application to produce the required output stroke.|$|E
50|$|<b>Telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> are {{commonly}} restricted {{to a maximum}} of 6 stages. 6 stages {{are commonly}} thought to be the practical design limit as stability problems become more difficult with larger numbers of stages. There are exceptions however, with one pneumatic cylinder manufacturer successfully incorporating up to 9 stages in their <b>cylinder</b> designs. <b>Telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> require careful design as they are subjected to large side forces especially at full extension. The weight of the steel bodies and the hydraulic oil contained within the actuator create moment loads on the bearing surfaces between stages. These forces, combined with the load being pushed, threaten to bind or even buckle the telescopic assembly. Sufficient bearing surfaces must therefore be incorporated {{in the design of the}} actuator to prevent failure in service due to side forces. <b>Telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> must only be used in machinery as a device for providing force and travel. Side forces and moment loads must be minimized. <b>Telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> should not be used to stabilize a structural component.|$|R
50|$|The {{smooth outer}} body of welded {{cylinders}} also enables {{the design of}} multi-stage <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{additional}} complexity makes {{double acting}} <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> very expensive. They are usually custom designed for each application.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} this is {{erecting}} the mast of a large mobile drilling rig. The mast is erected to the vertical position using a <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinder.</b> However, to lower the mast, gravity is not available for the initial tilt back from the vertical position. Thus, the plunger stage only of the telescopic actuator is equipped as a double acting cylinder to provide the initial force to pull the mast back from vertical. Once the tilt back has been initiated, then gravity takes over and supplies the force to complete the full cylinder retraction. The remaining stages, therefore, are single acting. This special combination is much less complex and much less costly than using an entirely double acting design.|$|E
50|$|The final {{development}} at Erma {{is known as}} the EMP 36. This can be considered an intermediate model between the EMP and the MP38. Although many details of the mechanism were changed from the EMP, it retained Vollmer's telescoping main operating spring basically unchanged. On the exterior, the most obvious differences are that the magazine housing was now almost vertical, although still canted slightly to the left and forward. The solid wood stock was replaced with a wood frame and a folding metal butt. It is not entirely clear who designed the EMP 36, although Berthold Geipel himself is usually credited. Apparently, the features of the new design were the result of another secret contract with the German army. The EMP's <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinder</b> return spring guide was retained for the Maschinenpistole 38.|$|E
50|$|Single acting {{telescopic}} cylinders are {{the simplest}} and most common design. As with a single acting rod style cylinder, the single acting <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinder</b> is extended using hydraulic or pneumatic pressure but retracts using external forces when the fluid medium is removed and relieved to the reservoir. This external retraction force is usually gravity acting on {{the weight of the}} load. This external weight must obviously be sufficient to overcome the friction and mechanical losses within the machine design even after the work portion of the machine cycle has been accomplished. In the example above of the dump truck, the weight of the dump body, now raised at an angle of 60 degrees but empty of the load, must be enough to force the unpressurized hydraulic fluid out of the cylinder and cause it to retract to the fully collapsed position.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Hyco Large Bore, Long Stroke <b>Telescopic</b> <b>Cylinders</b> {{are used}} on heavy {{equipment}} such as this oil drilling rig ...|$|R
50|$|Heavy duty <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{are usually}} powered by oil hydraulics, whereas some lighter duty units {{could also be}} powered by {{compressed}} air.|$|R
50|$|<b>Telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{can usually}} be {{classified}} into two basic designs: single acting and double acting. A number of other special designs also exist including a hybrid single/double acting design, and a constant speed, constant thrust design.|$|R
50|$|In {{case the}} {{retracted}} {{length of the}} cylinder is too long for the cylinder {{to be built in}} the structure, <b>Telescopic</b> <b>cylinder</b> can be used. One has to realize that for simple pushing applications telescopic cylinders might be easily available; for higher forces and/or double acting cylinders, they must be designed especially and are very expensive. If hydraulic cylinders are only used for pushing and the piston rod is brought in again by other means, one can also use Plunger cylinders. Plunger cylinders have no sealing over the piston, if the piston even exists. This means that only one oil connection is necessary. In general the diameter of the plunger is rather large compared with a normal piston cylinder, whereas a hydraulic motor will always leak oil. A hydraulic cylinder does not have a leakage over the piston nor over the cylinder head sealing so that {{there is no need for}} a mechanical brake.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Wear plate welding {{machines}} requires some special raw {{material handling system}} as they are heavy to handle. Wear plate welding requires 4 - 5 workers for handling and clamping of raw material. This paper reviews different material handling equipment used by various industries. As the raw material is heavy, {{it is very difficult}} to handle manually. Hence there is requirement of integrated material handling and clamping system to do this heavy task. An integrated approach for material handling and clamping is suggested. In this paper, various handling mechanisms like scissor lifting mechanism, hydraulic lift platform in scissors type mechanism, hydraulic lifting system based on multistage <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinder</b> are discussed. Their analysis is done by using various software. Some failure diagnosis points are also discussed by mathematical calculations. Clamping mechanisms like electric power clamping device driven by step motor and screw-toggle-lever force amplifier in series, unilateral fixtures for sheet-metal parts with holes are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The lack of {{knowledge}} concerning the commissioning of a daylight responsive system constitutes a serious impediment to their widespread use. Furthermore, installation details and tools regarding their photosensor position and field of view (FOV) are insufficient. This paper presents a decision making method capable to estimate the best position of a photosensor on the ceiling and its proper FOV based on multiple criteria analysis. The criteria used are (a) the correlation of the lighting levels between the working plane and the ceiling, (b) the corresponding energy savings and (c) the lighting adequacy which {{is defined as the}} percentage for occupied time with total illuminance exceeding design illuminance (i. e 500 lux EN 12464 - 1, 2011) and is strongly affected by the control algorithm. A number of simulations with variable FOV and position of photosensors were performed in order to clarify the calculation procedure of the proposed methodology. Three different typical room geometries have been used with variable window sizes and orientation. Furthermore a prototype photosensor with variable FOV {{through the use of a}} <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinder</b> was constructed and placed in a scale room (1 : 10) in order to verify the results of simulations. The verification was based on a set of experimental procedures concerning measurements of the spatial response of the prototype photosensor (for various FOVs) and measurements of ceiling/workplane illuminance inside the scaled room for various combinations of position and FOV of the photosensor. The proposed methodology can be used as a tool for the determination of the optimum operation of a daylight responsive system with photosensors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{are often}} {{limited to a}} maximum {{hydraulic}} pressure of 2000-3000 psi. This is because the outward forces produced by internal hydraulic pressure tends to expand the steel sleeve sections. Too much pressure will cause the nested sleeves to balloon outward, bind the mechanism and stop moving. The danger exists that a permanent deformation of the outer diameter of a sleeve could occur, thus ruining a telescopic actuator. For this reason, {{care must be taken}} to avoid shock pressures in a hydraulic system using <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Often such hydraulic systems are equipped with shock suppressing components, such as hydraulic accumulators, to absorb pressure spikes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> are {{designed}} {{with a series of}} steel or aluminum tubes of progressively smaller diameters nested within each other. The largest diameter sleeve is called the main or barrel. The smaller inner sleeves are called the stages. The smallest stage is often called the plunger or piston rod.|$|R
50|$|<b>Telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{are often}} seen used on heavy {{equipment}} such as construction equipment. Yet small bore designs also exist that are used on lighter duty applications such as agricultural equipment. Often these cylinders are unnoticed by most people as they go unseen, buried deep inside common machinery such as a garbage truck.|$|R
50|$|Typical {{applications}} for double acting <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> include the packer-ejector cylinders in garbage trucks and transfer trailers, horizontal compactors, telescopic excavator shovels, and roll-on/roll-off trucks. In {{all of these}} applications, the cylinder operates near horizontally and thus gravity is not available to retract the actuator. A double acting design is therefore required to both push and pull the telescoping mechanism.|$|R
50|$|A {{double acting}} {{cylinder}} is extended and retracted using hydraulic or pneumatic pressure in both directions. Double acting <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> are thus much more complex in design than the single acting type. This additional complexity {{is due to the}} requirement of adding retracting piston faces to all of the cylinder stages and the difficulty in supplying pressurized fluid to the retraction pistons of the intermediate stages.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> are {{generally}} employed as linear actuators, when the desired mov-ing span is several times {{the length of}} the closed device, like in cargo trucks lifting applications, for instance. During the active phase of the actuation, hydraulic power is normally used to feed pressurized fluid inside the cylinder, thus providing the progressive extension of the cylinder elements and the re-quired operative axial thrust. In this condition, therefore, cylinders must bear external compressive loadings in an increasingly slenderness configuration, which can give rise to buckling failures. In this study, experimental measurements of the limiting axial loadings of <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders,</b> in full extended conditions, have been performed both in laboratory and during real operations on the field. The strains of the material in the critical sections and the lateral deflections of the tested struc-tures have been recorded {{as a function of the}} applied loads. The results of this investigation are pre-sented and discussed, in order to identify the signals of incipient buckling and find out the ultimate load carrying capabilities of this kind of components...|$|R

50|$|The two {{hydraulic}} lifting pistons each {{consisted of}} one stationary cylinder and four extending <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The largest extending cylinder included a flange halfway along its length, against which hydraulic pressure could be selectively applied from either above or below; {{it was used}} during raising to delay its extension until all other cylinders had extended, and also to begin the lowering process when the lifting frame was vertical (once lowering had thus been initiated, gravity finished the job).|$|R
50|$|An {{application}} for <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> commonly seen {{is that of}} the dump body on a dump truck used in a construction site. In order to empty the load of gravel completely, the dump body must be raised to an angle of about 60 degrees. To accomplish this long travel with a conventional hydraulic cylinder is very difficult considering that the collapsed length of a single stage rod cylinder is approximately 110% of its output stroke. It would be very challenging for the design engineer to fit the single stage cylinder into the chassis of the dump truck with the dump body in the horizontal rest position. This task is easily accomplished, however, using a <b>telescopic</b> style multi-stage <b>cylinder.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The single-cam-type radial {{piston motor}} exists in many {{different}} designs itself. Usually the difference lies {{in the way the}} fluid is distributed to the different pistons or cylinders, and also the design of the cylinders themselves. Some motors have pistons attached to the cam using rods (much like in an internal combustion engine), while others employ floating [...] "shoes", and even spherical contact <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> like the Parker Denison Calzoni type. Each design has its own set of pros and cons, such as freewheeling ability, high volumetric efficiency, high reliability and so on.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Bullworker {{consists of}} two sleeved, spring-loaded, <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> in the center, with two hand grips affixed at the outermost ends. Two opposing cables {{are attached to the}} hand grips {{at each end of the}} device. The apparatus weighs about four lbs (1.8 kg). Exercises are performed by pushing inwards on the contractible cylinders or by pulling the cables outwards, away from the cylinders. The resultant compression of the internal spring creates the desired resistance; the Bullworker returns to its original position when pressure is released. A range of up to 150 lbs (68 kg) or more of resistance is possible.|$|R
5000|$|Telescoping cylinders, {{also known}} as <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> can be either single or double-acting. The {{telescoping}} cylinder incorporates a piston rod nested within a series of hollow stages of increasing diameter. Upon actuation, the piston rod and each succeeding stage [...] "telescopes" [...] out as a segmented piston. The main benefit of this design is the allowance for a notably longer stroke than would be achieved with a single-stage cylinder of the same collapsed (retracted) length. One cited drawback to telescoping cylinders is the increased potential for piston flexion due to the segmented piston design. Consequently, telescoping cylinders are primarily utilized in applications where the piston bears minimal side loading.|$|R
50|$|The {{extension}} and retraction fluid supply ports on double acting hydraulic <b>telescopic</b> <b>cylinders</b> are usually located {{at opposite ends}} of the cylinder assembly. The extension port is mounted {{at the base of the}} outer barrel and the retraction port is mounted in the end of the plunger section. This can, in some applications, prove to be very difficult to connect with hydraulic hoses due to the distance between these ports at full extension. In such a circumstance, both ports can be located in the barrel. An internal passageway must be fitted, however, so that the retracting fluid is supplied to the plunger section at full extension. This special passageway is in itself a telescopic assembly that extends with the cylinder and is outfitted with seals on the various stages.|$|R
5000|$|Conventional {{hydraulic}} elevators. They use {{an underground}} hydraulic cylinder, are quite common for low level buildings with {{two to five}} floors (sometimes but seldom up to six to eight floors), and have speeds of up to 200 ft/min m/s. For higher rise applications, a <b>telescopic</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> can be used.|$|R
50|$|Care must {{be taken}} when {{controlling}} most double acting <b>telescopic</b> design <b>cylinders.</b> The effective retraction area is often {{much less than the}} extension area. Thus if the hydraulic fluid return line is blocked during extension apressure intensifying effect can occur causing seal failure or even causing the metal sleeve to balloon outward. The cylinder could thus be rendered unable to retract because of failed seals or jam in position due to binding.|$|R
