5|$|Muslim {{women also}} {{generally}} wear similar dresses as the Hindu women. However, the one {{difference is that}} the tunic they wear is considerably shorter, just touching the knee. They don a small vest called a angi, worn beneath the bodice. A small shirt or kurta is also common. Hindu men wear an angrakha, long tunic that touches <b>the</b> <b>knees.</b> A cloth waist-band and tight fitting pajama and a small pagri (top hat) worn on top of the head completes their ensemble.|$|E
5|$|OCD {{occurs when}} a loose piece of bone or {{cartilage}} partially (or fully) separates {{from the end of}} the bone, often because of a loss of blood supply (osteonecrosis) and decalcification of the trabecular bone matrix. The loose piece may stay in place or slide around, making the joint stiff and unstable. OCD in humans most commonly affects <b>the</b> <b>knees,</b> ankles, and elbow but can affect any joint.|$|E
5|$|Patellar luxation, {{also known}} as luxating patella, is a {{hereditary}} disorder affecting <b>the</b> <b>knees.</b> It is where the kneecap slips off the groove on which it normally sits. The effects can be temporary with the dog running while holding its hind leg in the air before running on it again once the kneecap slipped back into place as if nothing has happened. Dogs can {{have a problem with}} both rear knees, and complications can include arthritis or torn knee ligaments. Severe cases can require surgery.|$|E
50|$|Lack of {{stability}} in <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> is a {{main cause of}} rupturing the ACL in <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> Most advanced athletes struggle to gain enough stability within <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> while exercising causing the possibility of injury. The ACL exists to provide <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> stability {{but it is the}} athletes duty to make sure <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> is stable {{enough to be able to}} play out the game.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>knee</b> has a {{more complex}} {{movement}} pattern compared to the hip. At heel contact <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> extensor and flexor muscles co-contract to provide stability for <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint since it is almost maximally extended {{at that point in}} time. Shortly after, as the foot becomes flat on <b>the</b> ground, <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> gradually flexes approximately 10-15 degrees reaching the maximum at about 15% of the gait cycle. This small amount of knee flexion is controlled eccentrically by <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> extensor muscles which serve the purpose of cushioning the rate of loading on the lower-limb and preventing excessive knee flexion. Following through to mid-and terminal stance, <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> gradually extends with concentric activity of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> extensor muscles and approaches near full extension as heel off occurs (30-40% of gait cycle). At this point <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> flexor muscles concentrically flex <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> again for swing phase. <b>The</b> maximum <b>knee</b> flexion that occurs during swing is about 60 degrees.|$|R
50|$|Popliteal pulse: Above <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> in <b>the</b> popliteal fossa, {{found by}} holding <b>the</b> bent <b>knee.</b> <b>The</b> patient bends <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> at {{approximately}} 124°, and the physician holds it {{in both hands}} to find the popliteal artery in the pit behind <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> (Popliteal artery).|$|R
5|$|Blood {{lead levels}} are an {{indicator}} mainly of recent or current lead exposure, not of total body burden. Lead in bones {{can be measured}} noninvasively by X-ray fluorescence; {{this may be the}} best measure of cumulative exposure and total body burden. However this method is not widely available and is mainly used for research rather than routine diagnosis. Another radiographic sign of elevated lead levels is the presence of radiodense lines called lead lines at the metaphysis in the long bones of growing children, especially around <b>the</b> <b>knees.</b> These lead lines, caused by increased calcification due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing foreign materials such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|Burial 67 {{was found}} in a cist under the second of five stucco floor levels in Northeast Plaza Structure 2. The {{skeleton}} was lying on its back with the head towards the north. The remains were poorly preserved but belonged to an adult. Of the skull only some dental remains were found. A ceramic plate had been placed under the head of the deceased and another plate was placed upon <b>the</b> <b>knees.</b> The plate was painted with four seated anthropomorphic figures with inclined head and wearing leather gloves with jaguar claws. The facial features of the figures are unusual. The bottom of the plate bears the image of a dancer. The ceramics date the burial to the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} that Tabak had {{then tried to}} conceal the crime by disposing of her body. The court heard that DNA swabs taken from Yeates' body had provided a match with Tabak. Samples found behind <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> of her jeans indicated {{she may have been}} held by the legs as she was carried, while fibres suggested contact with Tabak's coat and car. Blood stains were found on a wall overlooking a quarry close to where Yeates was discovered. The prosecution also said that Tabak attempted to implicate Jefferies for the murder during the police investigation, and that in the days following Yeates' death, he had made internet searches for topics that included the length of time a body takes to decompose and the dates of refuse collections in the Clifton area.|$|E
50|$|Another error where {{health of}} <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint is {{concerned}} is when <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> is not {{aligned with the}} direction of the toes. If <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> is not tracking over the toes during the movement this results in twisting/shearing of the joint and unwanted torque affecting the ligaments which can soon result in injury. <b>The</b> <b>knee</b> should always follow the toe. Have your toes slightly pointed out in order to track <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> properly.|$|R

50|$|The LCL {{is usually}} injured {{as a result}} of varus force across <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> which is a force pushing <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> from <b>the</b> medial (inner) side of the joint, causing stress on the outside. An example of this would be a direct blow to the inside of <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> <b>The</b> LCL can also be injured by a noncontact injury, such as a hyperextension stress, again causing varus force across <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 13 March 1995, {{a pair of}} legs, severed at <b>the</b> <b>knees,</b> {{was found}} in a plastic bag {{floating}} off Clifford Pier. Three days later, a pair of thighs and a torso were found in the same area, also in a plastic bag. Initially, Singapore police could only determine that the body parts belonged to a Caucasian, and they had a possible name after receiving a missing person report for Lowe from the South African High Commission. Vanessa Lowe filed the report because she was distressed that her husband, who used to make daily contact with his family when overseas, had not called home or returned to South Africa by 12 March. Lowe's colleagues at work also tried to determine his whereabouts through personal contacts in Singapore. On 1 April, she confirmed that the body parts were her husband's through visual identification. However, his arms and head were never found.|$|E
5|$|Other methods {{commonly}} practised in Europe included severing the tendons at <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> or placing poppy seeds, millet, or sand on {{the ground}} at the grave site of a presumed vampire; this was intended to keep the vampire occupied all night by counting the fallen grains, indicating an association of vampires with arithmomania. Similar Chinese narratives state that if a vampire-like being came across a sack of rice, it would have to count every grain; this is a theme encountered in myths from the Indian subcontinent, as well as in South American tales of witches and other sorts of evil or mischievous spirits or beings.|$|E
5|$|Astaroth {{is shown}} to be a large, muscular, bald, dark-skinned {{humanoid}} with solid white eyes.

50|$|For example, in a valgus {{deformity}} of <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>the</b> distal {{part of the}} leg below <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> is deviated outward, {{resulting in}} a knock-kneed appearance.

5|$|In the 1st and 2nd centuries, a Roman soldier's clothes {{consisted}} of a single-piece, short-sleeved tunic the hem of which reached <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> and special hobnailed sandals (caligae). This attire, which left the arms and legs bare, had evolved in a Mediterranean climate and was not suitable for northern Europe in cold weather. In northern Europe, long-sleeved tunics, trousers (bracae), socks (worn inside the caligae) and laced boots were commonly worn in winter from the 1st century. During the 3rd century, these items of clothing became much more widespread, apparently common in Mediterranean provinces also. However, {{it is likely that}} in warmer weather, trousers were dispensed with and caligae worn instead of socks and boots. Late Roman clothing was often highly decorated, with woven or embroidered strips, clavi, circular roundels, orbiculi, or square panels, tabulae, added to tunics and cloaks. These colourful decorative elements usually {{consisted of}} geometrical patterns and stylised plant motifs, but could include human or animal figures. A distinctive part of a soldier's costume, though it seems to have also been worn by non-military bureaucrats, was a type of round, brimless hat known as the pannonian cap (pileus pannonicus).|$|E
5|$|Kikai {{had started}} his Asakusa series of square, {{monochrome}} portraits {{as early as}} 1973, but after this there was a hiatus until 1985, {{when he realized that}} an ideal backdrop would be the plain red walls of Sensō-ji. At that time, the great majority of his Asakusa portraits adopted further constraints: the single subject stands {{directly in front of the}} camera (originally a Minolta Autocord TLR, later the Hasselblad), looking directly at it, and is shown from around <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> upwards. Kikai may wait at the temple for four or five hours, hoping to see somebody he wants to photograph, and three or four days may pass without a single photograph; but he may photograph three people in a single day, and he has photographed over six hundred people in this way. He believes that to have a plain backdrop and a direct confrontation with the subject allows the viewer to see the subject as a whole, and as somebody on whom time is marked, without any distracting or limiting specificity.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 1976, as Fox {{was driving}} to the family home at Morrill Street in Port Coquitlam, he became distracted by nearby bridge construction, and crashed {{into the back of}} a pickup truck. While his car was left undriveable, Fox emerged with only a sore right knee. He again felt pain in December, but chose to ignore it until the end of {{basketball}} season. By March 1977, the pain had intensified and he finally went to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of cancer that often starts near <b>the</b> <b>knees.</b> Fox believed his car accident weakened his knee and left it vulnerable to the disease, though his doctors argued there was no connection. He was told that his leg had to be amputated, he would require chemotherapy treatment, and that recent medical advances meant he had a 50-percent chance of survival. Fox learned that two years before, the figure would have been only 15 percent; the improvement in survival rates impressed on him the value of cancer research.|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} cruciate ligament {{is one of the}} four crucial ligaments in <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> It originates from the lateral condyle of the femur and goes to the intercondyloid eminence of the tibia. Its function is to provide stability in <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> and minimize stress across <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint. It also restrains excessive forward movement in the leg and limits rotational movements in <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b>|$|R
50|$|A knee {{orthosis}} (KO) or {{knee brace}} is a brace that extends {{above and below}} <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint and is generally worn to support or align <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> In <b>the</b> case of diseases causing neurological or muscular impairment of muscles surrounding <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> a KO can prevent flexion or extension instability of <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> In <b>the</b> case of conditions affecting the ligaments or cartilage of <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> a KO can provide stabilization to <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> by replacing <b>the</b> function of these injured or damaged parts. For instance, knee braces {{can be used to}} relieve pressure from the part of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint affected by diseases such as arthritis or osteoarthritis by realigning <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint into valgus or varus. In this way a KO may help reduce osteoarthritis pain. However, a knee brace is not meant to treat an injury or disease on its own, but is used as a component of treatment along with drugs, physical therapy and possibly surgery. When used properly, a knee brace may help an individual to stay active by enhancing the position and movement of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> or reducing pain.|$|R
50|$|An ACL rupture is {{the most}} common injury that takes place in <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> <b>The</b> ACL is very small, smaller than some might think; the average length is 38mm and only 11mm wide. <b>The</b> <b>knee</b> is formed by the {{connection}} of the femur (upper leg bone) and the Tibia (lower leg bone) with another two bones been the fibula (small bone next to the tibia) and <b>the</b> patella (<b>the</b> <b>knee</b> cap). Within these two main bones tendons attach the bones to the muscles that give <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> movement, while <b>the</b> ligaments provide <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> with stability. <b>The</b> ACL looks like a mixture of an oval and triangle shape, and is located in a very compact area within <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> <b>The</b> ACL fibers are in place to give direction for <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> to move, such as a kicking or twisting motion. If an ACL rupture occurs, it immediately forces an increase for not only the anterior tibial translation but also the internal tibial rotation as the femur is pushed back to rotate, this creates trauma to <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> as it is not stabilised. The ACL is there to create rotational stability within <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> to be able to produce different motions. Importantly the ACL restraints the anterior tibial translation, providing 85-87% total retraining force.|$|R
5|$|The Cleveland Bay {{generally}} {{stands between}} , and is always bay in colour. Bright bay horses (bays {{with a more}} reddish tint than normal) are the most preferred by breeders, followed by ordinary bay, dark bay and then light bay. This preference for brighter shades of bay was originally stated in the official breed standard, although this stipulation has since been removed. In some bloodlines of the breed, light, grayish hairs in the mane and tail are known as a characteristic of pure blood. White markings, except for a small star on the forehead, render the horse inadmissible to the stud book. Horses {{are expected to have}} complete black points, including completely black lower legs. Legs that are red below <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> and hocks are considered faulty in colour, although they do not disqualify a horse from registry. The occasional red legs that appear in the breed are thought to come from chestnut Thoroughbred stallions that were crossed into Cleveland Bay and Yorkshire Coach Horse bloodlines at some points in the history of both breeds. The uniformity in colour is encouraged as it makes creating matching driving teams and pairs very easy. When the breed was first developed, the horses almost always had a countershaded dorsal stripe, but these disappeared with the outcrossings of the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Bunning's {{perfect game}} {{occurred}} in the 1964 season, during which the Phillies finished {{at the top and}} the Mets finished bottom. Pitcher Jim Bunning, in his first season with the Phillies, entered play on June 21 with a 6–2 record on the season. He was opposed on the mound by Tracy Stallard for the Mets in the first game of a doubleheader. Through the first four innings, Bunning totaled four strikeouts through twelve batters. In the fifth inning, Phillies second baseman Tony Taylor preserved the perfect game with his strong defensive play. A diving catch and a throw from <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> kept Mets catcher Jesse Gonder off of the bases. Bunning also made plays at the plate, hitting a double and driving in two runs in the sixth inning. By the end of the game, even the Mets fans were cheering Bunning's effort; he had only reached a three-ball count on two batters, and retired shortstop Charley Smith on a pop-out, and pinch-hitters George Altman and John Stephenson on strikeouts, to complete the perfect game. Bunning, who at the time had seven children, said that his game, pitched on Father's Day, could not have come at a more appropriate time. He remarked that his slider was his best pitch, just like the no-hitter I pitched for Detroit six years ago. Bunning became the first pitcher to throw a winning no-hitter in both leagues, and posted the first regular-season perfect game since Charlie Robertson in 1922 (Don Larsen's prior perfect game was in the 1956 World Series). The Phillies also won the second game of the doubleheader, 8–2, behind Rick Wise.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas have {{a complex}} set of postures in communication. When afraid, the ears are folded flat, and are often {{combined}} with baring of the teeth and a flattening of the mane. When attacked by other hyenas or by wild dogs, the hyena lowers its hindquarters. Before and during an assertive attack, the head is held high with the ears cocked, mouth closed, mane erect and the hindquarters high. The tail usually hangs down when neutral, though it will change position according to the situation. When a high tendency to flee an attacker is apparent, the tail is curled below the belly. During an attack, or when excited, the tail is carried forward on the back. An erect tail does not always accompany a hostile encounter, as it has also been observed to occur when a harmless social interaction occurs. Although they do not wag their tails, spotted hyenas will flick their tails when approaching dominant animals or when there is a slight tendency to flee. When approaching a dominant animal, subordinate spotted hyenas will walk on <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> of their forelegs in submission. Greeting ceremonies among clan-members consist of two individuals standing parallel to each other and facing opposite directions. Both individuals raise their hind legs and lick each other's anogenital area. During these greeting ceremonies, the penis or pseudo-penis often becomes erect, in both males and females. Erection is usually a sign of submission, rather than dominance, and is more common in males than in females.|$|E
