5|$|Despite {{these changes}} the knife was true to Emerson's {{original}} design, and even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> {{not have the}} craftsmanship of a handmade piece of cutlery it satisfied customers with {{their own version of}} Emerson's work at a lower price point and without the five-year wait.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane {{activity}} was above average {{during this time}} period. A hurricane in 1903 hit near Atlantic City, causing heavy damage near the shore. The most severe hurricane in the time period was the 1944 Great Atlantic Hurricane. <b>Though</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not make landfall, it brought strong winds and waves to the coastline, destroying hundreds of homes.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{noted that}} the book took on a darker tone than its predecessors, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> contain some humour. Some {{considered}} the main themes to be love and death, and trust and redemption. The character development of Harry and several other teenage characters was also remarked upon.|$|E
5|$|After it was showcased at E3 2000, Dungeon Siege {{proceeded}} {{to win the}} Best RPG award from Game Revolution and Most Immersive Role-playing Game award from GameSpot. After release, it was nominated for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences's 2003 Annual Interactive Achievement Awards in the Computer Role-Playing Game of the Year and Innovation in Computer Gaming categories, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not win either, losing to Neverwinter Nights and Battlefield 1942, respectively.

5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the show was good to average, with a general appreciation for the realistic portrayal of Middle America. Generally speaking, however, there were serious doubts about whether the show {{would be able to}} stay on the air very long, though it has since gone on to complete five seasons. The episode's viewership of just over seven million was characterized as disappointing, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> relatively well among men aged 18 to 34.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the delay}} of the 707 programme, the {{contribution}} of the 707B and 707A towards the basic design of the 698 was not considered significant, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> highlight a need to increase the length of the nosewheel to give a ground incidence of 3.5 degrees, the optimum take-off attitude. The 707B and 707A proved the design's validity and gave confidence in the delta planform. A second 707A, WZ736 and a two-seat 707C, WZ744 were also constructed but they played no part in the 698's development.|$|E
5|$|Gasketball was {{released}} for iPad on August 9, 2012. They {{had decided to}} release the game as an ethically non-coercive free-to-play game, with a free base game and in-app purchases for the extended content. Not as many players paid for the content as expected. This was due, in part, to the players' difficulty in finding the purchase function. The game had been downloaded 200,000 times in its August 2012 launch week and was briefly ranked {{near the top of}} an iTunes top downloads ranking, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not break the top 200 grossing chart.|$|E

5|$|His first efforts, {{published}} under {{a variety}} of pseudonyms, were cheaply printed potboiler novels. In 1829 he finally released a novel under his own name, titled Les Chouans; it was a minor success, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not earn the author enough money to relieve his considerable debt. He found fame soon afterwards with a series of novels including La Physiologie du mariage (1829), Sarrasine (1830), and La Peau de chagrin (1831).|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{maturity}} {{is reached}} at between 1–3 years. Most Eurasian sparrowhawks {{stay on the}} same territory for one breeding season, though others keep the same one for up to eight years. A change of mate usually triggers the change in territory. Older birds tend {{to stay in the}} same territory; failed breeding attempts make a move more likely. The birds which kept the same territories had higher nest success, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not increase between years; females which moved experienced more success the year after changing territory.|$|E
5|$|The 1884 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was one of}} only three Atlantic {{hurricane season}}s, along with 1852 and 1858, in which every known tropical cyclone attained hurricane status. Overall, four tropical cyclones developed, three of which made landfall. The first system was initially observed over the northwestern Atlantic Ocean on September1. It struck Newfoundland the following day, but impact there is unknown. On September3, the next hurricane developed, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not effect land in its duration. The third hurricane struck Georgia, accompanied by damaging waves in north Florida.|$|E

5|$|The 1963 season {{unfolded}} for the Mets {{much like}} the previous year's, though they lost only eight games to begin the season, rather than nine, but they still finished 51–111, in last place. One highlight, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not count in the standings, was the Mayor's Trophy Game on June 20 at Yankee Stadium. Stengel played to win; the Yankees under Houk possibly less so, and the Mets beat the Yankees, 6–2.|$|E
5|$|The Atlanta Constitution {{voted the}} 1911 team's backfield {{the best in}} the South. It {{consisted}} of: Lew Hardage, Wilson Collins, Ammie Sikes, and Ray Morrison. The team's only blemish was a one-point loss to Michigan. The 1912 team led the nation in scoring by margin of victory and lost only to national champion Harvard, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> suffer a tie with Auburn, the next season's Southern champion.|$|E
5|$|The show {{averaged}} a 2.0 Nielsen rating over August and September 1996, considered a strong start for an animated series. Though Cartoon Network suffered declining viewership in 1996, Quest was consistently {{one of the}} highest-rated programs; later season-one episodes drew around 650,000viewers. Real Adventuress merchandise performed poorly, and it failed to build consistent ratings in its targeted demographics (<b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> attract adult audiences). Turner tried to revive interest in February 1997 with a contest for an adventurous trip to Jamaica called Quest World Adventure.|$|E

Poe intended to include {{it in his}} collection Tales of the Folio Club or another called Phantasy Pieces, though neither collection was ever produced.|$|E
5|$|<b>Though</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not hit Puerto Rico, Hurricane David passed {{less than}} 100 miles (160 km) {{south of the}} island, {{bringing}} strong winds and heavy rainfall to the island. Portions of southwestern Puerto Rico experienced sustained winds of up to 85 mph (135 km/h), {{while the rest of}} the island received tropical storm-force winds. While passing by the island, the hurricane caused strong seas and torrential rainfall, amounting to 19.9 inches (505 mm) in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico and up to 20 inches (510 mm) in the central mountainous region.|$|E
5|$|Three roads with {{residential}} housing—Manor Way, Windmill Way, and Park Way—were completed {{before the}} outbreak of the First World War. All construction work was halted, and did not resume until 1919. The Ruislip Manor Cottage Society had been set up in 1911 to facilitate the construction of cottages and small housing in the area, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not manage to build as much as had been planned. As the council took on several plots in Eastcote, only four houses could be built by the society there. In Northwood, eighteen cottages were later built in 1926.|$|E
