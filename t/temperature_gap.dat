5000|$|As {{the formula}} shows, the COP of a {{heat pump system}} can be {{improved}} by reducing the <b>temperature</b> <b>gap</b> [...] minus [...] at which the system works. For a heating system this would mean two things: 1) reducing the output temperature to around 30 C which requires piped floor, wall or ceiling heating, or oversized water to air heaters and 2) increasing the input temperature (e.g. by using an oversized ground source or by access to a solar-assisted thermal bank [...] ). Accurately determining thermal conductivity will allow for much more precise ground loop [...] or borehole sizing, resulting in higher return temperatures and a more efficient system. For an air cooler, COP could be improved by using ground water as an input instead of air, and by reducing temperature drop on output side through increasing air flow. For both systems, also increasing the size of pipes and air canals would help to reduce noise and the energy consumption of pumps (and ventilators) by decreasing the speed of fluid which in turn lower the Re number and hence the turbulence (and noise) and the head loss (see hydraulic head). The heat pump itself can be improved by increasing {{the size of the}} internal heat exchangers which in turn increase the efficiency (and the price) relative {{to the power of the}} compressor, and also by reducing the system's internal <b>temperature</b> <b>gap</b> over the compressor. Obviously, this latter measure makes such heat pumps unsuitable to produce high temperatures which means that a separate machine is needed for producing hot tap water.|$|E

5000|$|A unique {{challenge}} {{arises in}} trying to grow impurity-free films of a catalyst in Chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Ruthenium metal activates C-H and C-C bonds, that aids C-H and C-C bond scission. This creates a potential catalytic decomposition path for all metal-organic CVD precursors {{that is likely to}} lead to significant carbon incorporation. Platinum, a chemically similar catalyst, catalyzes dehydrogenation of five- and six-member cyclic hydrocarbons into benzene. The d-bands of ruthenium lie higher than those in platinum, generally predicting stronger ruthenium-adsorbate bonds than on platinum. Therefore, it is likely that ruthenium also catalyzes dehydrogenation of five- and six-member hydrocarbon rings to benzene. Benzene dehydrogenates further on ruthenium surfaces into hydrocarbon fragments similar to those formed by acetylene and ethene on ruthenium surfaces. In addition to benzene, acetylene and ethene, pyridine also decomposes on ruthenium surfaces, leaving bound fragments on the surface. Ruthenium is unusually well studied in the surface science and catalysis literature due to its industrial importance as a catalyst. There are many studies of individual molecular behavior on ruthenium in surface science. However, understanding the behavior of each ligand on its own is not equivalent to understanding their behavior when co-adsorbed {{with each other and with}} the precursor. While there is no significant pressure difference between surface science studies and CVD, there is often a <b>temperature</b> <b>gap</b> between temperatures reported in surface science studies and CVD growth temperatures. Despite these complications, ruthenium is a promising candidate for understanding chemical vapor deposition and precursor design of catalytic films.|$|E

This study assesses its relation to commonly measured haemodynamic parameters in the postresuscitation phase when the child has reached the intensive care unit, and compares this with core-peripheral <b>temperature</b> <b>gap.</b>  METHODS—Ninety standardised measurements of capillary refill time were made on 55 patients, who were divided into postcardiac surgery (n = 27), and general (n = 28), most of whom had septic shock (n = 24). A normal capillary refill time was defined as ⩽ 2 seconds. Measured haemodynamic variables included: cardiac index, central venous pressure, systemic vascular resistance index, stroke volume index (SVI), and blood lactate. Seventy measurements were made on patients while being treated with inotropes or vasodilators.  RESULTS—Capillary refill time and <b>temperature</b> <b>gap</b> both correlated poorly with all haemodynamic variables among postcardiac surgery children. For general patients, capillary refill time was related to SVI and lactate; <b>temperature</b> <b>gap</b> correlated poorly with all variables. General patients with a prolonged capillary refill time had a lower median SVI (28 v 38 ml/m 2) but not a higher lactate (1. 7 v 1. 1 mmol/l). A capillary refill time of ⩾ 6 seconds had the best predictive value for a reduced SVI.  CONCLUSION—Among ventilated, general intensive care patients, capillary refill time is related weakly to blood lactate and SVI.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{examination}} of extrusion coating product performance, which is aspired to improve with resin choice and essential process parameters such as melt <b>temperature</b> and air <b>gap</b> distance. The performance is defined via two main testing methods, which are hot air sealing and pinhole measurements. Furthermore, infrared (IR) thermometry is applied to monitor the polymer film temperature during processing and contribute the conclusions of the laboratory measurement results. Theoretical part presents essential information about polymer material, extrusion coating process and parameters, product properties and fundamentals of IR thermometry. Firstly, the structure, properties and polymerization of polyethylene are discussed, followed by the principles of extrusion coating process. The knowledge of extrusion coating is reinforced with process parameters and their influence is considered via product properties. Finally, IR thermometry is examined including theoretical basis, equipment introduction and measurement method. Experimental part includes trial runs to produce product samples and laboratory measurements that focus on the quality control. Experiments concentrate on three main variables; melt <b>temperature,</b> air <b>gap</b> and resin choice, which are adjusted through the measurements. Hot air sealing and pinhole analyses are performed after each trial run in order to monitor the product quality and discover optimal process conditions for every material. The ultimate goal is to examine combination of melt <b>temperature,</b> air <b>gap</b> distance and material, which produces the best possible hot air sealing and pinhole results with the lowest possible coating weight. The measurements of experimental part offer a few confirmed outcomes, which enable conclusions concerning optimal melt <b>temperature</b> and air <b>gap</b> settings. Furthermore, comparison between different resin choices is possible. Higher melt temperature setting mainly improves hot air sealing and pinhole results. However, some resins does not endure excessive heating and degradation and the properties start to decline. The effect of air gap is similar to the melt <b>temperature.</b> Higher air <b>gap</b> setting decreases sealing temperature and reduces pinholes almost invariably despite increased cooling of the film. Moreover, increased neck-in must be noticed as the advantages of higher air gap are considered. The comparison of resin choice produce the most controversial results and the effect of blending is partially indefinite. First set of measurements support the blending in order to improve hot air sealing and pinhole results, but the advantage is disappeared in subsequent examination. Furthermore, increased material cost do not support the use of blends...|$|R
