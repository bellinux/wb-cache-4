5|$|The {{idea for}} the attacks came from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who first {{presented}} it <b>to</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> in 1996. At that time, bin Laden and al-Qaeda were {{in a period of}} transition, having just relocated back to Afghanistan from Sudan. The 1998 African Embassy bombings and bin Laden's 1998 fatwā marked a turning point, as bin Laden became intent on attacking the United States.|$|E

Massoud-controlled militias blocked the pipeline's northern access route due to the longstanding civil war with Taliban forces. After Massoud was killed September 9, 2001 in a Taliban bombing, Raphel's critics accused her of collaborating with the Taliban to advance American commercial interests even as the group gave refuge <b>to</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> Ayman al-Zawahiri and other senior al-Qaeda leaders in the time leading up to the September 11 attacks.|$|E

The 9/11 Commission reported that, despite recent alliances with the U.S., the UAE had strong ties <b>to</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> and Al Qaeda prior to the 9/11 attacks. The measure in the House was H.R 4807, and in the Senate, S. 2333; these were introduced to require a 45-day review of this transfer of ownership.

However, she failed to collect enough petition signatures for a non-partisan candidacy.

In 2004, she announced plans {{to run for mayor}} of Milan with a similar promise.

Though Scalia was not referring to any particular individual, the Supreme Court was about to consider the case of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, supposed driver <b>to</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> who was challenging the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay. A group of retired military officers that supported Hamdan's position asked Scalia to recuse himself, or step aside from hearing the case, which he declined to do. The Court held 5–3 in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that the federal courts had jurisdiction to consider Hamdan's claims; Scalia, in dissent, contended that any Court authority to consider Hamdan's petition had been eliminated by the jurisdiction-stripping Detainee Treatment Act of 2005.|$|E

The Presiding Officer had already ruled that the testimony of most of Hamdan's first interrogators at Guantanamo was inadmissible, due to their use of coercive techniques. On July 29, 2008, the Presiding Officer ruled {{that he was going}} to penalize the Prosecution for failing to release documents to the Defense by disallowing McFadden's testimony from May 2003.

2500|$|In October 2004, when al-Zarqawi swore loyalty <b>to</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> and al-Qaeda, he {{renamed the}} group Tanẓīm Qāʻidat al-Jihād fī Bilād al-Rāfidayn (...) , {{commonly}} known as al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). Although the group never called itself [...] al-Qaeda in Iraq, this remained its informal name for many years. Attacks by the group on civilians, Iraqi government forces, foreign diplomats and soldiers, and American convoys continued with roughly the same intensity. In a letter to al-Zarqawi in July 2005, al-Qaeda's then deputy leader Ayman al-Zawahiri outlined a four-stage plan to expand the Iraq War. The plan included expelling US forces from Iraq, establishing an Islamic authority as a caliphate, spreading the conflict to Iraq's secular neighbours, and clashing with Israel, which the letter said, [...] " [...] was established only to challenge any new Islamic entity".|$|E
2500|$|One {{perceived}} {{benefit of}} the Reagan Doctrine was the relatively low cost of supporting guerrilla forces compared to the Soviet Union's expenses in propping up client states. Another benefit {{was the lack of}} direct involvement of American troops, which allowed the United States to confront Soviet allies without sustaining casualties. Especially since the September 11 attacks, some Reagan Doctrine critics have argued that, by facilitating the transfer of large amounts of weapons to various areas of the world and by training military leaders in these regions, the Reagan Doctrine actually contributed to [...] "blowback" [...] by strengthening some political and military movements that ultimately developed hostility toward the United States, such as al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. However, no direct U.S. aid <b>to</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> or any of his affiliates has ever been established.|$|E
2500|$|As {{opposed to}} the member states, the {{relation}} of EU law and international law is debated, particularly relating to the European Convention on Human Rights and the United Nations. All EU member states are party to both organisations through international treaties. The Treaty on European Union article 6(2) required the EU to accede to the ECHR, but would [...] "not affect the Union's competences as defined in the Treaties". This was thought necessary before the Treaty of Lisbon 2007 {{to ensure that the}} EU gave adequate protection to human rights, overseen by the external European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. However, in Opinion 2/13, after a request by the Commission to review their plan to accede, the Court of Justice (in Luxembourg) produced a five main reasons why it felt that the accession agreement as it stood was incompatible with the treaties. The reasoning was regarded by a majority of commentators as thinly veiled attempt of the Court of Justice to clutch onto its own power, but it has meant the Commission is redrafting a new accession agreement. Under TEU articles 3(5), 21, 34 and 42, the EU must also respect the principles of the United Nations Charter. After the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution to freeze the assets of suspected terrorists, linked <b>to</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden.</b> This included a Saudi national, Mr Kadi. Sweden froze his assets pursuant to an EU Regulation, which gave effect to the UN Security Council resolution. In Kadi v Commission, Mr Kadi claimed {{there was no evidence that}} he was connected to terrorism, and he had not had a fair trial: a fundamental human right. The opinion of AG Maduro recalled Aharon Barak, of the Supreme Court of Israel, that it [...] "is when the cannons roar that we especially need the laws". The Court of Justice held that even UN member cannot contravene 'the principles that form part of the very community legal order'. In effect the EU has developed a rule that within the boundaries of certain jus cogens principles, other courts may take primacy. The content of those core principles remains open to ongoing judicial dialogue among the senior courts in Europe.|$|E
