40|$|Abstract. We {{studied the}} high {{frequency}} vibrator of the <b>top</b> <b>drive</b> <b>system</b> based on ADAMS. A parameterized simulation {{model of the}} axial rotation of gears and eccentric block is established, and dynamic change of the impact and the actual movement of the rotating components of the <b>top</b> <b>drive</b> <b>system</b> are analyzed. Then create a virtual prototype {{on the basis of}} that. It can obtain curves that some parameters change relative to time, such as the exciting force and the centroid position of eccentric block. Thus it achieves dynamic simulation analysis of virtual prototype of the <b>top</b> <b>drive</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>top</b> <b>drive</b> {{allows the}} {{drilling}} rig to drill the longer section of a stand of drill pipe in one operation. A rotary table type rig can only drill 30 ft (single drill pipe) sections of drill pipe whereas a <b>top</b> <b>drive</b> can drill 60 - 90 ft stands (double and triple drill pipe respectively, a triple being three joints of drillpipe screwed together), depending on {{the drilling rig}} size. Handling longer sections of drill pipe enables a drilling rig to make greater daily progress because up to 90 ft can be drilled at a time, thus requiring fewer [...] "connections" [...] to add another 30 ft of drill pipe. Another advantage of <b>top</b> <b>drive</b> <b>systems</b> is time efficiency. When the bit progresses under a kelly drive, the entire string must be withdrawn from the well bore {{for the length of}} the kelly in order to add one more length of drill pipe. With a <b>top</b> <b>drive,</b> the draw works only has to pick up a new stand from the rack and make up two joints. Making fewer and quicker connections reduces the risk of a stuck string from annulus clogging while drilling fluid is not being pumped.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of operational capabilities of inclined drilling equipment and technology is presented. Two options of rotary drilling are reviewed as technical and technological solutions, facilitating construction of wells with difficult profiles. The first option {{implies that the}} driver unit of the drill bit is represented by downhole drilling motor, the second one utilizes sophisticated rotary steerable systems. Practical results of drilling wells with difficult profiles are presented. A quality assessment of drilling is provided through the example of comparing designed and actual trajectories, using different driver units for the drill bit, as well as properties of surrounding rocks, rheology of the drill fluid and other characteristics of dynamically active systems. A range of rotation speed has been determined that allows rotary steerable systems to have minimal oscillation amplitude of the bottom-hole assembly.   Analysis of investigation {{results showed that the}} main source of oscillations is linked to bending and compressing stresses, caused by well deviations as well as rigidity of the drilling tool. In effect, in the bottom-hole assembly occur auto-oscillations, making it impossible to correct azimuth and zenith angles. Alteration of rigidity in the bottom part of the tool and drilling parameters, implying reduced rotation speed of the drill string and regulation of drill bit pressure, can partially solve this problem, though increase in rotation speed is limited by technical characteristics of existing <b>top</b> <b>drive</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- A price {{effective}} <b>drive</b> <b>system</b> for associate {{induction motor}} for <b>top</b> performance industrial <b>drive</b> <b>system</b> is bestowed during this paper. Within the projected approach, {{rather than a}} traditional 6 -switch, 3 -phase (SSTP) electrical converter a four-switch 3 -phase electrical converter (FSTP) is used.

These modifications ar supported the principle of similarity between FSTPI and SSTPI, wherever the α-ß plane is split in to six sectors and formation of the voltage area vectors is completed within the same approach as for SSTPI by exploitation effective (mean) vectors. This approach permits U. S. exploitation the well-known established shift table of SSTPI for FSTPI.
