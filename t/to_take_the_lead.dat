5|$|Chris Carter {{had envisioned}} Lance Henriksen portraying the {{character}} of Frank Black, long before he was ever contacted. Although Carter's colleagues responded positively to the selection, the Fox Network wanted someone younger <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> part.

5|$|During {{the first}} quarter of the game, the Mean Green led the Midshipmen by as much as 18 points. In the second quarter the teams {{combined}} to score 63 points, setting records for most points scored in a quarter and a half. The Midshipmen rallied around a strong rushing offense <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> at the beginning of the third quarter, and the Mean Green's offensive momentum sputtered during the second half. Navy held the lead for the remainder of the game.|$|E

5|$|In the 3rd quarter, New York's defense made a {{goal line}} stand, {{which became a}} turning point in the game. New York, who had trouble {{mounting}} drives to that point, then had a 95-yard drive which culminated in a touchdown, making the score 14–10. They drove again in the 4th quarter, with quarterback Charlie Conerly throwing a 15-yard touchdown pass to Frank Gifford <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead,</b> 17–14.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, Jake Peavy {{surrendered}} three earned runs in five innings, {{which caused}} his ERA {{to rise from}} 1.98 to 2.14. This gave Young, who had a 2.08 ERA, the National League-leading average for one day. The next day, Brad Penny allowed only one earned run over eight innings <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> with a 2.04 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Reserve Tom Watson {{replaced}} Partridge in {{goal and}} Hallam {{returned to the}} forward line for {{the second round of}} the Birmingham Cup, at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers.

After consulting both captains, the referee ordered half-an-hour's extra time, but Wanderers, whose players had already returned to the dressing-rooms, refused to play, so Jenkyns claimed the game for Small Heath.|$|E

The Steelers drove from their own 27yard line, but were unable to score.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the steam ship-of-the-line led to a building competition between France and Britain. Eight sister ships to Napoléon were built in France {{over a period of}} ten years, but the United Kingdom soon managed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> in production. Altogether, France built ten new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 from older ships of the line, while the United Kingdom built 18 and converted 41.|$|E
5|$|A {{minute after}} this, Liverpool scored through captain Gerrard, who {{connected}} with Riise's cross and lofted a header past Dida. Soon afterwards, Liverpool scored again as Šmicer beat Dida with a long-range {{shot into the}} bottom left-hand corner to leave Liverpool a goal behind. Three minutes after Šmicer's goal, Liverpool were awarded a penalty, after Gerrard made a run into the Milan box for Baros' lay-off and was brought down by Gennaro Gattuso. Xabi Alonso's penalty was saved, but he scored from the rebound to equalise for Liverpool. Milan and Liverpool had chances <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> after this, but Clarence Seedorf and Riise failed to score.|$|E

5|$|Ali Aaltonen was {{replaced}} by Eero Haapalainen. He in turn was displaced by the Eino Rahja, Adolf Taimi and Evert Eloranta triumvirate. The last Red Guard commander in chief was Kullervo Manner. Some talented men with a high sense of responsibility such as Hugo Salmela in Tampere rose up <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead,</b> {{but they could not}} change the course of the war. The Reds achieved some local victories, as they retreated from southern Finland toward Russia, e.g. against German troops in the fierce Battle of Syrjäntaka on 28–29 April in Tuulos.|$|E
5|$|Brooks then {{executed}} a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost {{even with his}} Soviet counterpart Kopliakov. He had drawn level halfway through his leg and made a superior turn <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> as they headed home. The Soviet freestyler pulled level with 25m to go before Brooks again pulled away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. He did not breathe {{in the last ten}} metres, and claimed to be laughing for the final five metres, confident that his opponent could not pass him. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his team mates. In doing so, he recorded the swiftest freestyle split in the relay, faster than that of the individual 100m freestyle gold medallist, Jörg Woithe of East Germany.|$|E
5|$|In early 1955 Hordern {{was asked}} by the British theatre manager and {{producer}} Binkie Beaumont <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> in André Roussin's comedy Nina, directed by Rex Harrison. The play, which starred Edith Evans, Lockwood West, and James Hayter, transferred from Oxford to the Theatre Royal in Brighton. Beaumont's request came at short notice because Hordern's predecessor had proved inadequate. The play was cursed with bad luck: Evans fell ill and was replaced midway by an understudy who neglected to learn her lines; Harrison frequently upset the cast, which resulted in reduced morale. When Evans did return, she walked off stage and left after seeing empty seats in the front row.|$|E

5|$|Less than 30seconds {{after the}} {{subsequent}} kick-off, United forced another corner, but Schmeichel stayed in his penalty area this time under instruction from Ferguson. Beckham again swung the corner in, finding {{the head of}} Sheringham, who nodded the ball down {{across the face of}} goal. Solskjær reacted fastest, shot out a foot and poked the ball into the roof of the Bayern goal for United <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead.</b> The goal was timed at 90+2:17'. Solskjær celebrated by sliding on his knees, mimicking Basler's earlier celebration, before quickly being mobbed by the United players, substitutes and coaching staff. Schmeichel, in his own penalty area, cartwheeled with glee.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool had {{a chance}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> before half-time. Phil Neal {{advanced}} down the right hand side of the pitch and found Dalglish who passed to Graeme Souness, who ran late through the Real defence. His subsequent shot was not held by Agustín Rodríguez, but Souness was unable {{to get to the}} rebounded ball. Real had the first chance of the second half. Liverpool's defence had stopped as they thought Cunningham was offside, however he was not and Camacho advanced towards Ray Clemence in the Liverpool goal. Clemence came off his line and ran towards the Real midfielder, Camacho attempted to lob the ball over the keeper, but his shot went over the goal.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher {{started from}} pole {{position}} alongside McLaren driver David Coulthard. Barrichello began from third, alongside Coulthard's teammate Mika Häkkinen. The front two of Michael Schumacher and Coulthard battled {{for first place}} until Coulthard served a ten-second stop-go penalty on lap 14 as his mechanics worked on his car 15 seconds before the race began. Just before half distance, Michael Schumacher made an early pit stop allowing Barrichello <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> until his own pit stop on lap 43. By this time rain began to fall causing drivers to make the switch to wet-weather tyres. Michael Schumacher retained his lead throughout and took the victory 0.1 seconds ahead of Barrichello.|$|E

5|$|Michigan State {{continued}} its recent dominance over Michigan, winning 28–14. The first half was relatively quiet, with each team only scoring one {{touchdown in the}} first quarter. Michigan's Denard Robinson ran in one from 15 yards out, with Michigan State responding with a one-yard touchdown run by Edwin Baker. After halftime, State's Kirk Cousins threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Keshawn Martin <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead.</b> The Spartans added more points with another touchdown catch by Martin, this one from 13 yards out. In the fourth quarter, Michigan scored their only points {{of the second half}} with a 34-yard touchdown catch and run by Roy Roundtree. State sealed their victory with a 39-yard interception return touchdown by Isaiah Lewis, handing Michigan their first loss of the season.|$|E
5|$|Nebraska {{received}} {{the ball to}} start the game but Maurice Purify fumbled on the first play from scrimmage. Oklahoma recovered the ball at the Nebraska 2-yard-line and scored a touchdown <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> 70 with 48seconds expired off the clock. It was the fastest score in Big12 Championship Game history. With 5:35 {{left in the first}} quarter, Oklahoma's quarterback completed a touchdown pass to Malcolm Kelly to go up 140. With 4:37 left in the first half, Nebraska's Zach Taylor threw a touchdown pass and the extra point shaved Oklahoma's lead to 147, which was still the score as the game went to half-time.|$|E
5|$|Piquet, on a {{one-stop}} strategy {{after his}} poor qualifying performance, had fortuitously pitted {{immediately prior to}} the safety car's deployment and was also fuelled {{to the end of}} the race. Promoted to third place from 14th beforehand following the pit stops, he was set <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> once Hamilton and Heidfeld (who also had not pitted under the safety car conditions) pitted for their final stops. Further back, Vettel squeezed past Alonso at the pit exit, pushing him over the white line separating the pit lane exit from the track. Alonso complained over his radio but no action was taken against either driver. Meanwhile, Räikkönen dropped several places to 11th, having had to queue behind Massa at the second pit stops.|$|E
