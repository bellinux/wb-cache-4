5|$|Tropical Storm Beryl caused {{flooding}} {{in several states}} in <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> in August1994. The second named storm and third tropical cyclone of the season, Beryl developed from an upper-level low pressure area over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on August14. Initially a tropical depression, the system intensified into a tropical storm about 24hours after forming. Beryl then moved slowly northeastward and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) before making landfall near Panama City, Florida, early on August16. Within 12hours of moving inland, the storm weakened to a tropical depression, but persisted as a tropical cyclone {{for a few days}} while traversing <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Beryl was absorbed by a frontal system while situated over Connecticut early on August19.|$|E
5|$|Frances {{then passed}} over the central {{sections}} of Florida, in the United States, three weeks after Hurricane Charley, causing significant damage to the state's citrus crop, closing major airports and schools, and forcing the cancellation of a collegiate football game. The storm then moved briefly offshore from Florida, into the northeast Gulf of Mexico, and made a second U.S. landfall, at the Florida Panhandle, before accelerating northeast through <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> near the Appalachians and into Atlantic Canada while weakening. A significant tornado outbreak accompanied the storm across <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> nearly equaling the outbreak from Hurricane Beulah. Very heavy rains fell in association with this slow-moving and relatively large hurricane, which caused floods in Florida and North Carolina. Some 49 people died from the cyclone. Damages totaled US$12billion (2004 dollars).|$|E

5|$|The {{bog turtle}} is native only to <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> congregating in colonies that often consist {{of fewer than}} 20individuals.

Bog turtles have sometimes been seen in cow pastures and near beaver dams.|$|E

5|$|The {{phenomenon}} underlying global dimming {{may also}} have regional effects.

5|$|Although Josephine {{remained}} well offshore of <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> the {{effects from the}} storm and an area of high pressure produced strong winds and high seas along the coast. In North Carolina, high tides caused severe beach erosion and minor damage to ocean-front houses. Minor coastal flooding occurred in New York and New Jersey. In addition, one fatality occurred when a man drowned after falling off his boat while sailing a river in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Felix was looping {{offshore}} <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> {{it produced}} swells of 26ft (8m) along the Nova Scotia coast on an otherwise sunny day. Beaches were closed. Buoys near the Newfoundland coast recorded wave heights of 49ft (15m), while buoys farther offshore reported wave heights of 82ft (27.5m). The outer rainbands {{of the storm}} dropped light rainfall, peaking at around 3.43mm (87mm) in northern Newfoundland. Offshore Caithness in Scotland, waves from the remnants of Felix submerged an experimental wave power station, damaging it further after previous waves damaged the system.|$|E

5|$|During the season, three hurricanes {{developed}} from five named storms. This was below {{the average of}} 10storms per season, and represented the fewest tropical storms since 1939.

In addition, temperatures in <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> were cooler than usual. Activity through September10 was the quietest in 30years.|$|E
5|$|Exsudoporus frostii (formerly Boletus frostii), {{commonly}} known as Frost's bolete or the apple bolete, is a bolete fungus first described scientifically in 1874.

Exsudoporus frostii is distributed in <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> from Maine to Georgia, and in the southwest from Arizona extending south to Mexico and Costa Rica. A mycorrhizal species, its fruit bodies are typically found growing near hardwood trees, especially oak.|$|E
