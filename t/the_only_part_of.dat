5|$|At {{the time}} of the North Korean invasion, the closest American ground force was the 24th Infantry Division, which was based in Japan. This {{division}} had fewer than its normal contingent of soldiers, and most of its equipment was rather old due to the U.S. Congress's reductions in military spending. In any case, the 24th Infantry Division was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the U.S. Army that was available to quickly reinforce South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the closure}} of the {{original}} London tram network in 1952, Holborn provided an interchange between trams and tubes, via the underground Holborn tramway station located a little distance south of the underground railway station. This was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> London with an underground tram system, and Holborn tramway station (named Great Queen Street when first opened) is still extant beneath ground, though with no public access.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, {{the church}} seen by Llwyd, Jones and Glynne was {{demolished}} {{and the present}} structure was erected, designed by Henry Kennedy, architect of the Diocese of Bangor. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the old church to survive was some of the stonework {{at the base of}} the west wall. Some repair work was carried out in 1956.|$|E

5|$|The film's idea {{resulted}} from a small scale exercise between Nemescu and Liviu Marghidan {{when they were in}} university in 2003. The original idea belonged to Cătălin Mitulescu and Andreei Vălean; <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the original story that was kept is that of a group of boys trying to steal a trolleybus {{in order to get to}} some prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|Deptford borders {{the areas}} of Brockley and Lewisham to the south, New Cross {{to the west and}} Rotherhithe to the north west; Deptford Creek divides it from Greenwich to the east, and the River Thames {{separates}} the area from the Isle of Dogs to the north east; it is contained within the London SE8 post code area. The area referred to as North Deptford is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the London Borough of Lewisham to front the Thames and is sandwiched between Rotherhithe and Greenwich. Much of this riverside estate is populated by the former Naval Dockyards, now known as Convoys Wharf, the Pepys Estate and some eastern fringes of the old Surrey Commercial Docks.|$|E
5|$|El Toro {{has several}} {{similarities}} to Viper, the coaster that it replaced. The most obvious similarity is that El Toro uses Viper's station, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Viper {{that was not}} torn down. The station previously held two Viper trains at once, with a loading platform {{in the front and}} an unloading platform in the rear. The ramp that was previously Viper's main exit is now used only for wheelchair access, as El Toro has a new exit {{on the other side of}} the station. During El Toro's construction, the station was gutted and an entirely new platform built. Like El Toro, Viper turned left out of the station before the lift hill and turned left at the top of the lift before the first drop.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{route that}} {{are no longer in}} use are the goods yards at Partickhill and the Queen's Dock and the old {{terminus}} station at Hyndland.|$|R
50|$|For many years, the suites were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{music that}} were available, as the {{original}} score was not published until 1908, one year after Grieg's death, by Johan Halvorsen.|$|R
50|$|In 1908, a new {{building}} was built {{for high school students}} at 10th Street and Walnut Street. Two new wings were later added, which are <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building surviving today.|$|R
5|$|Governor Crittenden {{resigned}} on July 31, 1850 {{to accept}} President Millard Fillmore's appointment as attorney general, and Helm ascended to the governorship. As governor, Helm vetoed a legislative plan to cover deficits {{in the public}} school fund by drawing money from the state's sinking fund, but the General Assembly overrode the veto. He urged the legislature to fund a survey of the state's mineral reserves and a census of the state's agricultural and manufacturing resources. He called for spending on internal improvements and for raising judges' salaries to attract more qualified jurists to the bench. He also sought a ban on the carrying of concealed deadly weapons. The legislature did not act on any of these proposed reforms. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Helm's agenda that did progress through the General Assembly was election reform.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 Hornchurch Urban District was {{abolished}} and {{its former}} area was transferred from Essex to Greater London, {{to be combined}} {{with that of the}} Municipal Borough of Romford in order to form the present-day London Borough of Havering. In 1993 the Greater London boundary, to the east of Cranham and north of the railway line, was locally realigned to the M25 motorway, returning some mostly unpopulated areas of open land to Essex and leaving North Ockendon as <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Greater London outside the bounds of the motorway.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota is {{the second}} northernmost U.S. state (after Alaska). Its {{isolated}} Northwest Angle in Lake of the Woods county is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the 48 contiguous states lying north of the 49th parallel. The state {{is part of the}} U.S. region known as the Upper Midwest and part of North America's Great Lakes Region. It shares a Lake Superior water border with Michigan and a land and water border with Wisconsin to the east. Iowa is to the south, North Dakota and South Dakota are to the west, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba are to the north. With , or approximately 2.25 percent of the United States, Minnesota is the 12th-largest state.|$|E
50|$|By 1988, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station {{remaining}} {{were the}} two platforms and <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the stone retaining walls. The engine shed and sidings are long-gone {{and there is no}} trace of them.|$|R
50|$|In history, {{the city}} played a {{paramount}} role when in 1810 during the French occupation led by Napoleon, San Fernando and Cádiz were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> Spain {{which did not}} surrender to the French.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maze that {{remained}} for every series were (left to right, start to finish): the mirrored doors, the pipe, the pirate's cove, the desert, the bamboo walk, the yellow slide and the padded stairs.|$|R
5|$|Orford Castle {{was given}} to the Ministry of Works in 1962, and is now {{maintained}} by English Heritage. The keep of the castle is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the structure remaining intact, although the earthwork remains of the bailey wall are still visible; some of the ditches visible amongst the earthworks, however, are not medieval, but instead the result of the earlier quarrying of the bailey walls. The Orford Museum Trust has created exhibits in the upper hall featuring displays of archaeological artefacts found locally. Archaeological work to understand the surrounding environment has continued, most recently during 2002 to 2003. The castle is a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} Gregory's main motivation was {{to increase the}} number of Christians; others wonder if more political matters such as extending the primacy of the papacy to additional provinces and the recruitment of new Christians looking to Rome for leadership were also involved. Such considerations may have also played a part, as influencing the emerging power of the Kentish Kingdom under Æthelberht could have had some bearing on the choice of location. Also, the mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the Lombards. At the time of the mission Britain was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the former Roman Empire which remained in pagan hands and the historian Eric John argues that Gregory desired to bring the last remaining pagan area of the old empire back under Christian control.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago-style, glass-and-concrete {{skyscraper}} {{incorporated into}} its design several historic 19th-century buildings that lined Walnut Street. These buildings included three Federal-style rowhouses built in 1807 called York Row and the Italianate-style former {{headquarters of the}} Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, built in 1868–1869. After lying vacant and neglected for years, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> York Row preserved were the rowhouses' facades. Only a back portion of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society building was demolished, the rest being incorporated as retail and office space.|$|E

50|$|The Salón de Reinos, and the Salón de Fiestas (now the Casón del Buen Retiro) were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> palace {{to survive}} the intense French {{bombardment}} between 1808 and 1814 during the Peninsular War {{and the appearance of}} the buildings were transformed by post-war rebuilding.|$|R
50|$|Lebrunia coralligens {{is known}} from the Caribbean Sea, the Bahamas and Brazil at depths down to about 10 m. It inhabits crevices in coral heads and {{fissures}} in rocks, and often <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animal that are visible are {{the tips of the}} pseudotentacles.|$|R
5|$|The H. Lee House, a {{historic}} site built in 1928, was relocated by Caltrans {{at a cost}} of $1.5 million to the City Center Park in Lemon Grove. The portion from SR 94 to Jamacha Boulevard was completed in 2003, {{at a cost of}} $277 million; at this time, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the freeway from SR 54 to SR 52 not complete was between Navajo Road and Grossmont College Drive. During the construction, residents were inconvenienced by dirt, excess noise, and lights operating at nighttime. The entire freeway from SR 52 to I-8 was completed by mid-2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{epilogue}} is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> {{the film}} in colour and shows time-aged, but still vibrant, details of several of Andrei Rublev’s actual icons. The icons are shown in the following order: Enthroned Christ, Twelve Apostles, The Annunciation, Twelve Apostles, Jesus entering Jerusalem, Birth of Christ, Enthroned Christ, Transfiguration of Jesus, Resurrection of Lazarus, The Annunciation, Resurrection of Lazarus, Birth of Christ, Trinity, Archangel Michael, Paul the Apostle, The Redeemer. The final scene crossfades from the icons and shows four horses standing by a river in the rain.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> {{the region}} that is {{predominantly}} given over to crops is the land around the Humber estuary, where the well-drained fens result in excellent quality land. The lowland Cheshire Plain is mostly given over to dairy farming, while in the Pennines and Cheviots grazing sheep {{play an important role}} not just in agriculture but also in land management more generally. Heather moorland in the Pennine uplands is home to driven grouse shooting from 12 August (the Glorious Twelfth) until 10 December every year. In the twentieth century, numbers of red grouse and black grouse in the area fell significantly, but improved gamekeeping practices have resulted in both species making a comeback in the region.|$|E
50|$|The sails of {{the south}} was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the {{redundant}} but later revived gateway project, this and the refurbishment of the nearby bridge was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project to be realised. The bridge intended to take the M275 over a roundabout of an unbuilt junction roundabout.|$|R

5|$|The {{regional}} transit agency, renamed to Sound Transit {{the following}} year, began operating its Sound Transit Express buses under contract with Community Transit in September 1999. The new express buses connected park and rides in southwestern Snohomish County, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Community Transit's service area within the Sound Transit taxing district, to Downtown Seattle, including the newly opened, 1,000-stall Ash Way Park & Ride in northern Lynnwood. Sound Transit funded several capital projects to improve bus {{service on the}} Interstate 5 corridor, including direct access ramps from HOV lanes to Lynnwood and Ash Way park and rides that opened in 2004 and 2005, respectively. In 2011, the existing Mountlake Terrace park and ride was expanded with an 890-stall parking garage and bus platforms in the median of I-5 connected by a pedestrian bridge.|$|E
5|$|This {{area that}} is located south of the bathing complex, but no visible remains are left. According to a {{reconstruction}} of the site, this complex consisted of the complex of Pasarean Dalem Ledok Sari and the pool complex of Garjitawati with several pavilions and a garden. Pasarean Dalem Ledok Sari is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the complex that is still protected. Pasarean Dalem Ledok Sari was probably used as a meditation place for the sultan, or some said as the meeting place for the sultan and his concubines. In {{the middle of the}} building was also a sleeping room for the sultan with water flowing beneath it. There was also a kitchen, a looming room, a storage, two pools for the servants, and a garden.|$|E
5|$|This opulence {{could not}} be {{sustained}} indefinitely, and the Wall Street Crash badly damaged the family finances, decreasing their interest in, and visits to, Rùm. Sir George died in France, in July 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War Two, and was interred in the family mausoleum on Rùm. His widow continued to visit Rùm as late as 1954. In 1957 Lady Bullough sold the whole island, including the Castle and its contents, to the Nature Conservancy Council, on the understanding {{that it would be}} used as a national nature reserve; the mausoleum was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Rùm not included in the sale. Lady Bullough died in London, in 1967, at the age of 98; she was buried next to her husband in the Rùm mausoleum.|$|E
