500|$|Having {{appeared}} in six episodes {{of the third}} season and the first two of the fourth season, Blake Bashoff auditioned for and won the part of Moritz Stiefel in the Broadway musical Spring Awakening. He warned Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse {{that he would be}} unable to shoot Lost for at least six months beginning in December 2007, as he rehearsed for and performed in the production. Being [...] "big fans" [...] of the musical and congratulating Bashoff on what they thought was an [...] "amazing opportunity," [...] they brainstormed ideas with the other writers to write him out of the story while they still had him at their disposal. Having decided some <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> Karl would eventually die, they pinpointed the episode. The cliffhanger of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] sees Karl shot dead by unseen killers in the jungle. Two episodes later, the character Miles Straume (Ken Leung) finds Karl partially buried in the jungle dirt, but this corpse is portrayed by a body double and not Bashoff. According to Bashoff, the writers hope that he can return to Lost at some point to [...] "serve a cool purpose like [...]" [...] In regard to his experience with Lost, Bashoff recounted that [...] "I love the show. 's a great group … and … you get to shoot in paradise"; however, he wished that he had learned more about Karl's backstory.|$|E

[...] Says Lunghi, [...] "The meeting was embarrassing because Stalin was so unimpressed. He offered no invitation. Mountbatten left with his tail between his legs." ...|$|E

At the time of announcement, Gunn was a former IBA cruiserweight champion and bare-knuckle heavyweight champion, with a record of 72-0 with 72 knockouts. The fight was made official at the press conference on December 7. Jones spoke of his long-awaited desire to fight Gunn, [...] "I always do things that people don't expect me to do. I promised Bobby a long <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> I would give him the opportunity, and I am a man of my word. Come February 17th, I am going to shock the world again." [...] At the official weigh-in Jones came in 199 pounds and Gunn weighed in lighter at 197.4 pounds. In a slow-paced fight, Jones stopped Gunn {{in the beginning of the}} 8th round, before Gunn had even left his corner, to win the vacant World Boxing Foundation cruiserweight title. Gunn injured his nose and was out boxed by Jones throughout seven rounds. In the post fight, Jones and Gunn both embraced.|$|E

40|$|Such dilemma between {{guilt and}} shameful {{has been an}} {{interesting}} topic {{in the field of}} social psychology since few <b>times</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>That</b> dilemma persists when discussing social control, self-control, individual moral values, moral standard, cross-cultural influence as well as education-related setting. It is predicted, the one which is more influential, whether guilt aspect or shameful aspect, will one way or another influence the way somebody’s behavior can be modified. This study investigates such tendency which prevails in public schools especially performed by pupils when treating their student’s misconduct. Research question forwarded is whether they exploit punishment or to create shaming feeling towards students who have made nuisances in school. The result shows method of punishment has been the only way of modifying behavior which is regarded deviant. Other finding, it is believed that, having given such punishment, shameful feeling will follow. This finding is in association with the character of Indonesian society toward the way guilt and shamefull operate.  ...|$|R
