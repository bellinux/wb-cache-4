5|$|The {{classical}} {{texts of}} Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice {{the virtue of}} Ahimsa, can and must do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone convicted of a crime. These discussions have led to <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> just war, <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> reasonable self-defence and <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> proportionate punishment. Arthashastra discusses, among other things, why and what constitutes proportionate response and punishment.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been many ideas of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies). <b>Theories</b> <b>of</b> an impersonal Universe governed by {{physical}} laws were first proposed by the Greeks and Indians. Ancient Chinese philosophy encompassed the notion of the Universe including both all of space and all of time. Over the centuries, improvements in astronomical observations and <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions of the Universe. The modern era of cosmology began with Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity, which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of the Universe as a whole. Most modern, accepted <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> cosmology are based on general relativity and, more specifically, the predicted Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|In {{opposition}} to the formal <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> the generative school, functional <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> grammar seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they {{relate to each other}} as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E

5|$|Alternate <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> self-defence, {{inspired}} by Ahimsa, build principles similar to <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, {{the founder of}} Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume {{that the world is}} free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.|$|E

Reduction functions allow us to reduce the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> lists to the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> constructors, the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> arrays to the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> equality, the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> sets to the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> equality, and the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> multisets to the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> integers.

5|$|More detail {{was given}} in Darwin's 1868 book on The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, which tried to explain {{heredity}} through his hypothesis of pangenesis. Although Darwin had privately questioned blending inheritance, he struggled with the theoretical difficulty that novel individual variations would tend to blend into a population. However, inherited variation could be seen, and Darwin's concept of selection working on a population {{with a range of}} small variations was workable. It was not until the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s that a model of heredity became completely integrated with a model of variation. This modern evolutionary synthesis had been dubbed Neo Darwinian Evolution because it encompasses Charles Darwin's <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> evolution with Gregor Mendel's <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> genetic inheritance.|$|E
