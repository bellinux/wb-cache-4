5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lakes</b> of the BWCAW {{are located}} in {{depressions}} formed by differential erosion of the tilted layers of the Canadian Shield. For the past two million years, massive sheets of ice have repeatedly scoured the landscape. The last glacial period ended with the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet from the Boundary Waters about 17,000 years ago. The resulting depressions in the landscape later filled with water, becoming <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> of today.|$|E
5|$|According to NJDEP reports, two {{developed}} lake {{communities in}} the Papakating Creek watershed—Lake Neepaulin and the nearby Clove Acres Lake contribute to phosphorus loading {{in the waters of}} Papakating Creek. The phosphorus loading may originate from the runoff of fertilizer applications on residential lawns, nearby agricultural operations, or from large populations of geese that inhabit <b>the</b> <b>lakes.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> {{is located}} about 6.5 km {{north of the}} {{municipal}} center of Midtbygda. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> Feren lies north of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> and <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> Fjergen lies southeast of <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b>|$|R
50|$|Part of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> shore is a sandbar that {{separates}} <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> from <b>the</b> Tasman Sea. When the Mid-Coast Council deems that <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> water level {{is too high}} and may cause flooding to low-lying areas around <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> a trench is constructed from <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> to <b>the</b> ocean using a bulldozer. This releases water from <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> into <b>the</b> ocean and considerably lowers <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> water level.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lake</b> is <b>the</b> biggest {{feature in}} the park, {{situated}} at the centre, it has a small island in the centre which was created for the wild birds which live and breed on <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> was restored to its full size with the extension to {{the west end of}} <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> in 2007, as part of the main restoration project. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> once featured boats but since the restoration of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>the</b> boats have not returned to <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b>|$|R
5|$|According to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), two {{developed}} lake {{communities in}} the Papakating Creek watershed—Lake Neepaulin and the nearby Clove Acres Lake contribute to phosphorus loading {{in the waters of}} Papakating Creek.

50|$|In 1984 <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> was deeded by Emilie Spivey to <b>the</b> <b>Lake</b> Spivey Civic Association {{which owns}} and manages <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> today. Members of the {{association}} include only property owners from the eight communities around <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> Each community has either one central marina or several smaller mooring strips located around <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> for access and docking. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> has no public access.|$|R
50|$|The {{water flows}} into <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> from <b>the</b> Songa river which flows out of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> Våvatnet on <b>the</b> border of Orkdal and Snillfjord. The water leaves <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> through <b>the</b> Skjenaldelva river which {{ultimately}} flows into <b>the</b> Trondheimsfjord. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> Hostovatnet lies about 7 km south of <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> fifth <b>lake</b> is <b>the</b> second-{{smallest}} of the chain. It {{is three}} times as large as <b>the</b> smallest sixth <b>lake.</b> Drainage from <b>the</b> upstream ponds enters {{the west end of}} <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> while <b>the</b> east end of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> overflows into <b>the</b> fourth <b>lake</b> 900 yd to <b>the</b> southeast. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> supports a population of native brook trout in competition with introduced yellow perch. Falls below <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> prevent upstream migration into <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b>|$|R
5|$|By noon on Sunday, weather {{conditions}} on lower Lake Huron {{were close to}} normal for a November gale. Barometric pressures in some areas began to rise, bringing hope of {{an end to the}} storm.

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{the existence of}} lakes of liquid water entirely encased in Europa's icy outer shell and distinct from a liquid ocean thought to exist farther down beneath the ice shell. If confirmed, <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> could be yet another potential habitat for life.|$|E
5|$|Fish, {{which may}} have been preyed upon by smaller crocodilians, are {{represented}} by teeth and scales. They include a myliobatiform ray referred to the genus Baibisha; an indeterminate member of the Neopterygii; a semionotid referred to the genus Lepidotes; a gar related to Atractosteus; a pycnodontid referred to the genus Stephanodus; and an indeterminate bowfin. Indeterminate caudatans (salamanders) and mammals are also present. As for plants, pollen samples indicate a tiered forest surrounding <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> of the Mussentuchit, containing a canopy of tree ferns, araucarias, and conifers, accompanying an undergrowth of ferns, small gymnosperms, and flowering plants. Algae would also have been present in the waters of <b>the</b> <b>lakes.</b> These plants would have provided an abundant source of food for Eolambia.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{does not}} cease when <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> freeze; ice fishing {{has been around}} since the arrival of early Scandinavian immigrants. Minnesotans have learned to embrace their long, harsh winters in ice sports such as skating, hockey, curling, and broomball, and snow sports such as {{cross-country}} skiing, alpine skiing, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling. Minnesota is the only U.S. state where bandy is played.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> is {{polymictic}} {{with a round}} {{shape and}} a depth which does not have substantial difference. <b>The</b> <b>lake's</b> area is 670,8 ha, the length is 3,9 km, has a width of 2,5 km, and the depth to 2.6 metres. In the Northern part of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> is located <b>the</b> island Ostrów Wielki with an area of 21 ha. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> is mainly surrounded by forests (about 95%, the rest 5% are fields and pastures). The shore of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> is a swamp, and is not easily accessible. The surface of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> is covered with vegetation from the water. The main inflow of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> is <b>the</b> river Rybnica, which carries water from <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> Brzozolasek. <b>The</b> outflow of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> is also by the river Rybnica in the South which flows the water to <b>the</b> nearby <b>lake</b> Pogubie Małe. From the Western side of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>the</b> river Zimna flows in.|$|R
50|$|Shawnee State Fishing Lake allows boating and fishing. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>lake's</b> website states boats {{may be used}} on <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> {{only for}} fishing. A public boat ramp is located at <b>the</b> <b>lake's</b> {{southeast}} corner, just north of <b>the</b> dam. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> is regularly stocked with catfish. Various other fishes are also in reasonable numbers in <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> Thirteen rock jetties have been built into <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> to serve as fishing piers. A number of campsites have been established along <b>the</b> <b>lake's</b> shore. These are all considered primitive, meaning they have no electrical or water hookups. However, three public pit toilets are located on <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> shores.|$|R
50|$|There {{are walking}} tracks around <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> and tour {{operators}} offer cruises on <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> Facilities at <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> include picnic grounds, a kiosk and a pre-war tea house {{which was built}} in 1926. Visitors may also swim in <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> and partake in birdwatching. Camping and domestic animals are prohibited near <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b>|$|R
5|$|Further {{works in}} the 1990s saw a second {{carriageway}} constructed from Mundaring to Sawyers Valley, and then extended to <b>The</b> <b>Lakes</b> {{at the edge of}} Perth. A dual carriageway was also constructed in Kalgoorlie, and a long overtaking lane was built near Clackline.|$|E
5|$|Historically, storms of such {{magnitude}} {{and with such}} high wind velocities have not lasted more than four or five hours. The Great Lakes storm, however, raged for more than 16hours, with an average speed of 60mph (100km/h), and frequent bursts of more than 70mph (110km/h). It crippled traffic on <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> and throughout the Great Lakes basin region.|$|E
5|$|In 1701, {{the first}} {{transportation}} routes through {{what became the}} state of Michigan were <b>the</b> <b>lakes,</b> rivers and Indian trails. Two of these trails followed parts of the future US2. The Sault–Green Bay Trail roughly followed the Lake Michigan shoreline routing of US2 between Escanaba and St. Ignace. The Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace with Sault Ste. Marie.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> is {{a popular}} {{recreational}} site.
