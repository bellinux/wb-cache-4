40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{estimate}} the annual average daily traffic in inter-urban networks determining the best correlation (affinity) between the short period traffic counts and permanent <b>traffic</b> <b>counters.</b> A bi-level optimisation problem is proposed in which an agent in an upper level prefixes the affinities between short period traffic counts and permanent <b>traffic</b> <b>counters</b> stations and looks to minimise the annual average daily traffic calculation error while, in a lower level, an origin–destination (O–D) trip matrix estimation problem from traffic counts is solved.

5000|$|These TMC's are square shaped {{boxes that}} have buttons for each {{direction}} of traffic flow. For example, east bound traffic entering an intersection has a button for those vehicles that turn, left, right or continue straight. Furthermore, an additional button is used for each direction to add the number of pedestrian and bicyclist movement. Typically automated <b>traffic</b> <b>counters</b> assess <b>traffic</b> flows, however, due to the differing angles of vehicles entering an intersection the present technology available {{is not able to}} quantify the traffic without major error. Traditional automated <b>traffic</b> <b>counters</b> have rubber tubes which are laid out across the road generally in a straight portion in order to have the wheels on the same axle hit at about the same time. When turning in an intersection the tires hit individually and the amount of error in the counter is increased. This means that TMC's are the only present option for quantifying traffic flows. They are used manually by an individual pressing the correlating button for every vehicle that enters and moves through the intersection.|$|R

50|$|To {{permanently}} or temporarily {{monitor the}} usage of a road, an electronic <b>traffic</b> <b>counter</b> can be installed or placed to measure road usage continuously or {{for a short period}} of time. Most modern equipment called ATR's (Automatic Traffic Recorders) store count and/or classification data recorded in memory in a timestamp or interval fashion that can be downloaded and viewed in software or via a count display on some equipment. In some instances people either draw up a table and/or use a tally to keep a record of vehicles which pass manually as an alternative to ATR's.|$|E
50|$|State {{and local}} governments {{frequently}} do traffic surveys with a pneumatic road tube <b>traffic</b> <b>counter.</b> Rubber hoses are stretched across a road and passing vehicles create air pulses that are recorded by a roadside counter. In 1970 the counts were mechanically recorded on a roll of paper tape. The time and number of axles were punched as a 16-bit pattern into the paper tape. (The standard Teletype paper tape uses only 8 bits.) Cities would hire private companies to translate the data into reports that traffic engineers could use to adjust traffic lights or improve roads.|$|E
50|$|A <b>traffic</b> <b>counter</b> is a device, often {{electronic}} in nature, used to count, classify, and/or {{measure the}} speed of vehicular traffic passing along a given roadway. The device is usually deployed in near proximity to the roadway and uses an on-road medium, such as pneumatic road tubes laid across the roadway, piezo-electric sensors embedded in the roadway, inductive loops cut into the roadway, {{or a combination of}} these to detect the passing vehicles. Pneumatic road tubes are generally used for temporary studies to study a sample of traffic, while piezo-electric sensors and inductive loops are used for permanent studies which can ascertain seasonal traffic trends and are often used in congestion monitoring on major roads. One of the first traffic counting units, called traffic recorders, was introduced in 1937, operated off a strip laid across the street, and used a six volt battery. Each hour it printed off a paper strip with the total for that hour. Recently, off-road technologies have been developed. These devices generally use some sort of transmitted energy such as radar waves or infrared beams to detect vehicles passing over the roadway. These methods are generally employed where vehicle speeds and volume are required without classification which require on-road sensors.|$|E

30|$|Permanent counts {{without missing}} or {{erroneous}} data provide actual temporal distributions of traffic and accurate estimates of parameters such as AADT. Since {{it is not}} feasible to have continuous <b>traffic</b> <b>counters</b> on every road segment for the entire year, short-period traffic counts are performed using portable counters for the roads without PTCs. Short-period counts ensure the geographic diversity of traffic counts, but they contain sample information and, therefore, yield only estimates of AADT after appropriate adjustment factors are applied. The data from PTCs are used to develop daily, hourly, and monthly expansion factors (DF, HF, and MF, respectively), which are then applied to short-term counts in order to estimate AADT [1].|$|R
5000|$|To measure AADT on {{individual}} road segments, traffic data is collected either by an automated <b>traffic</b> <b>counter</b> or hiring an observer to record traffic. There {{are two different}} techniques of measuring the AADTs for road segments. One technique is called continuous count data collection method. This is where sensors are permanently embedded into a road and traffic data is measured all 365 days. The AADT would be {{the sum of the}} total traffic for the entire year divided by 365 days. There is a problem with calculating the AADT with this method. The continuous count equipment is not operating for the full 365 days due to being shut down for maintenance or repair. Because of this, seasonal or day-of-week biases might skew the calculated AADT. In 1992, AASHTO released the AASHTO Guidelines for Traffic Data Programs, which identified a way to produce an AADT without seasonal or day-of-week biases by creating an [...] "average of averages." [...] For every month and day-of-week, a Monthly Average Day of Week (MADW) is calculated (84 per year). Each day-of-week's MADW is then calculated across months to calculate an Annual Average Day of Week (AADW) (7 per year). Finally, the AADWs are averaged to calculate an AADT. The United States Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has adopted this method as the preferred method in the Traffic Monitoring Guidehttp://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/tmguide/tmg2.htm#Computing%20AADT.|$|E

40|$|Present study {{investigates the}} traffic volume {{variations}} {{due to the}} interaction of sever weather conditions. The study is based on hourly traffic data from 350 permanent <b>traffic</b> <b>counter</b> sites located on provincial highway system of Alberta, Canada, and weather data obtained from Environment Canada weather stations located within 15 miles from the selected permanent <b>traffic</b> <b>counter</b> sites, during the period 1995 - 2005.

The model parameters include three sets of variables: amount of snowfall as a quantitative variable, categorized cold as a dummy variable and an interaction variable formed by the product of above variables. The developed models closely fit to the real data with R-square values of above 0. 99. The study results indicate that the impact of cold and snow on traffic volume varies with day of week, hour of day and adversity of weather conditions. Traffic volume on a day decreases with the increase in severity of cold and snow. A reduction of 1 % to 2 % in traffic volume for each centimeter snowfall is observed when the mean temperatures are above 0 o. For the days with zero precipitation, reductions in traffic volume due to mild and severe cold are 1 % an...|$|E

30|$|Highway {{agencies}} allocate {{a significant}} amount of their resources to traffic counting programs. The traffic volume data collected are used for studying temporal and spatial variation of traffic and estimating important traffic parameters such as average annual daily traffic (AADT), design hourly volume (DHV), and average daily vehicle distance traveled (DVDT). Estimation of these parameters is needed for design, planning, control, operation, and management of the highway infrastructure. The most commonly implemented counting programs by highway agencies are: (1) Continuous counting programs by permanent <b>traffic</b> <b>counters</b> (PTCs) record <b>traffic</b> volume every hour of everyday throughout the year, and (2) Sample counting programs by short-duration counts (SDCs) are conducted periodically (e.g., seasonally) or sporadically every year for durations ranging from a few hours to several weeks.|$|R
40|$|As cycling in British cities increases, so do {{conflicts}} between cyclists and other road users, {{as well as}} debates with city planners {{who are trying to}} balance cities’ transport infrastructures in the face of public spending cuts. In Tyne and Wear (North East England), incremental steps are taken by the local authorities to provide cycling infrastructure, albeit at a slow rate compared to the uptake of cycling in the commuting area. As a result, there appears to be increasing dissatisfaction from local campaign groups about the lack of a coherent cycling strategy, negative attitudes towards cyclists and even the refusal of the local public transport providers to allow bicycles on the metro system. This paper reports on a detailed survey of 72 commuter cyclists, while cycling in the area around Tyne and Wear. Data collection methods involved day-long GPS tracking alongside diaries for trip clarification and classification, over a period of 7 days. Secondary data involves the analysis of vehicle congestion data from <b>traffic</b> <b>counters,</b> superimposed on the main traffic arteries, cycling pathways and recently established 20 miles-per-hour zones. The aim of the paper is to present a comparative geographical analysis of primary tracks on everyday utility cycling, in comparison to “official” cycling network data of the study area. The purpose of this research is to provide evidence {{on the use of the}} area’s cycling infrastructure by experienced commuter cyclists, by estimating the cycle-miles on the cycling network as a percentage of the total, for the given sample. In order to fully comprehend the constraints imposed on cyclists, the tracks are analysed alongside vehicle congestion data.

40|$|Average {{travelling}} speed usually {{applied in the}} traffic analysis as required in the fundamental traffic model. As one type of speed under the space-mean speed, most of the researchers have derived the equation to estimate the space-mean speed. There are a few factors that influence the speed changes along the segment. The fluctuate speed along the segment give an idea to average the spot mean speed from at least two points in order to estimate the space-mean speed. This paper explores an alternative method on how to convert the time-mean speed to space-mean speed that can represent the actual operating speed along segment using the average technique. A total of 18 data sets of time-mean speed and space-mean speed in six segments of uninterrupted two-lane single carriageway road were collected using automatic <b>traffic</b> <b>counter</b> and moving car observer, respectively. Two sets of automatic <b>traffic</b> <b>counter</b> were installed along the segment to record the spot speed and then converted to the time-mean speed, while the moving car observer were conducted concurrently to get the space-mean speed. The data sets were analysed using linear regression analysis. The results of summary of model show a strong relationship with coefficient of determination, R 2 = 0. 808, while ANOVA test results show the coefficient of constant and time-mean speed is not zero with p-value is less than 0. 05 at confident level of 95 %.
