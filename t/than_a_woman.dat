25|$|Mansplaining differs {{somewhat}} {{from other}} forms of condescension {{in that it is}} specifically gender-related, rooted in a sexist assumption that a man will normally be more knowledgeable, or more capable of understanding, <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman.</b>|$|E

25|$|However, neither {{group of}} {{countries}} was pro-gender {{equality in the}} sense that policies aimed at equal rights between the sexes are popular. In Arab countries, 82% of survey respondents believe that a man has more right to a job <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> while 63% of respondents from the non-Arab countries felt the same way. These researchers attributed these attitudes to the strong religious identity and adherence of respondents thus implicating Islam in promoting gender inequality in majority Muslim nations.|$|E
25|$|Various {{cultural}} and social values have historically contributed to gender disparity in education. According to work done by Denga, one prominent cultural view {{is that it is}} better for the woman to stay home and learn to tend to her family instead of attending school. To explain the fact that more boys than girls participated in education, Nigerian researcher Obasi identified a host of constraints with 'Nigerian tradition' being named as top of the list. The 'Nigerian tradition' was explained as a tradition that attaches higher value to a man <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> whose place {{is believed to be the}} kitchen. A study by the University of Ibadan linked the imbalance in boys' and girls’ participation in schooling was to the long-held belief in male superiority and female subordination. This situation was further aggravated by patriarchal practices which gave girls no traditional rights to succession. Therefore, the same patriarchal practices encouraged preference to be given to the education of a boy rather than a girl.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} line {{of research}} is that which examines women's mate preferences across the ovulatory cycle. The theoretical underpinning {{of this research is}} that ancestral women would have evolved mechanisms to select mates with certain traits depending on their hormonal status. For example, the theory hypothesizes that, during the ovulatory phase of a woman's cycle (approximately days 10–15 of a woman's cycle), a woman who mated with a male with high genetic quality would have been more likely, on average, to produce and rear a healthy offspring <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who mated with a male with low genetic quality. These putative preferences are predicted to be especially apparent for short-term mating domains because a potential male mate would only be offering genes to a potential offspring. This hypothesis allows researchers to examine whether women select mates who have characteristics that indicate high genetic quality during the high fertility phase of their ovulatory cycles. Indeed, studies have shown that women's preferences vary across the ovulatory cycle. In particular, Haselton and Miller (2006) showed that highly fertile women prefer creative but poor men as short-term mates. Creativity may be a proxy for good genes. Research by Gangestad et al. (2004) indicates that highly fertile women prefer men who display social presence and intrasexual competition; these traits may act as cues that would help women predict which men may have, or would be able to acquire, resources.|$|E

Theologian Dale Allison considers that, given the [...] "cryptic" [...] nature of the lyrics, it is only through Harrison's subsequent comments that the listener knows that he is addressing God rather <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman.</b> Allison likens the song's message to that of later Harrison compositions such as [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] and [...] "Heading for the Light", through its conveying of a [...] "conversion experience".|$|E
500|$|On October 8, 2002, Toni Braxton and {{her team}} {{released}} a statement claiming that Jay-Z's song [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] had stolen Braxton's idea to sample the 1996 Tupac Shakur song [...] "Me and My Girlfriend". Braxton sampled Shakur's song on the track [...] "Me & My Boyfriend", included on Braxton's album, More <b>Than</b> <b>a</b> <b>Woman</b> (2002). In a call to a New York radio station, Braxton stated that [...] "Jay-Z and Beyoncé are messing with my money. They're trying to steal my mojo". Braxton said her song was recorded over the summer of 2002, and alleged that Jay-Z only decided to do [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] after she played her version of the song for Def Jam Recordings.|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the song}} is written in the key of G-sharp minor with Rihanna's vocal range {{spanning}} from the low note of F♯3 to the high note of C♯5. Lyrically, [...] "Te Amo" [...] tells of a relationship between two women, with one realizing that she is {{falling in love with}} Rihanna, proclaiming [...] "Te amo" [...] throughout the song (the Spanish and Portuguese phrase for [...] "I Love You"). As Rihanna realizes that the other woman is falling in love with her, Rihanna sings, [...] "I feel the love but I don't feel that way", meaning that she knows her suitor loves her, but does not want to become romantically involved with her. Ailbhe Malone of NME described the meaning of the lyrics in her review of Rated R, explaining that Rihanna sings from a male perspective as she portrays a man who cannot commit, rather <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who is [...] "clinging to an unrealistic ideal".|$|E

500|$|The general tone of {{the next}} day's press reviews ranged from {{disappointment}} to outrage. The more conservative critics complained about [...] "Wagnerism" [...] and the subordination of the voice to {{the noise of the}} orchestra. There was consternation that the heroine was an amoral seductress rather <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> of virtue; Galli-Marié's interpretation of the role was described by one critic as [...] "the very incarnation of vice". Others compared the work unfavourably with the traditional Opéra-Comique repertoire of Auber and Boieldieu. Léon Escudier in L'Art Musical called Carmens music [...] "dull and obscure ... the ear grows weary of waiting for the cadence that never comes". It seemed that Bizet had generally failed to fulfill expectations, both of those who (given Halévy's and Meilhac's past associations) had expected something in the Offenbach mould, and of critics such as Adolphe Jullien who had anticipated a Wagnerian music drama. Among the few supportive critics was the poet Théodore de Banville; writing in Le National, he applauded Bizet for presenting a drama with real men and women instead of the usual Opéra-Comique [...] "puppets".|$|E
500|$|Among leading musical figures at {{the premiere}} were Jules Massenet, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Charles Gounod. Geneviève, {{suffering}} from an abscess {{in her right}} eye, was unable to be present. The opera's first performance extended to four-and-a-half hours; the final act did not begin until after midnight. Afterwards, Massenet and Saint-Saëns were congratulatory, Gounod less so. According to one account, he accused Bizet of plagiarism: [...] "Georges has robbed me! Take the Spanish airs and mine out of the score and there remains nothing to Bizet's credit but the sauce that masks the fish". Much of the press comment was negative, expressing consternation that the heroine was an amoral seductress rather <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> of virtue. Galli-Marié's performance was described by one critic as [...] "the very incarnation of vice". Others complained {{of a lack of}} melody and made unfavourable comparisons with the traditional Opéra-Comique fare of Auber and Boieldieu. Léon Escudier in L'Art Musical called the music [...] "dull and obscure... the ear grows weary of waiting for the cadence that never comes". There was, however, praise from the poet Théodore de Banville, who applauded Bizet for presenting a drama with real men and women instead of the usual Opéra-Comique [...] "puppets". The public's reaction was lukewarm, and Bizet soon became convinced of its failure: [...] "I foresee a definite and hopeless flop".|$|E
500|$|Braxton's second studio album, Secrets, was {{released}} in 1996. Featuring songwriting and production by Reid, Babyface, Diane Warren, R. Kelly and David Foster, the album peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified eight-times platinum by the RIAA. It also made the top-ten in many other countries including Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The album features four singles, including two double A-sides. The first single, [...] "You're Makin' Me High", became Braxton's first number one single in the United States, where it topped the Hot 100 and R charts. [...] "Un-Break My Heart", the album's second single, topped the charts in the United States, Sweden, and Switzerland and peaked within the top-five in Canada, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom; it became the second biggest-selling single by a female artist in the United States. Secrets has sold about fifteen million copies worldwide. The following year, Braxton {{filed a lawsuit against}} LaFace, which asked for a release from her record contract. However, LaFace countersued, a move which prompted Braxton to file for bankruptcy. She spent the next year in a state of oblivion, but reached an agreement with LaFace the year after. Her third studio album, The Heat, {{was released}} in April 2000. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and topped the R/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It also reached number one in Canada and charted within the top-ten in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The lead single, [...] "He Wasn't Man Enough", became another top-five Hot 100 hit in the United States for Braxton and the second single, [...] "Just Be a Man About It", became a top-ten R hit. The Heat was certified double platinum by the RIAA and has sold four million copies worldwide. Braxton released her first Christmas album, Snowflakes, the next year. Her fifth studio album More <b>Than</b> <b>a</b> <b>Woman</b> {{was released in}} 2002. In the United States the album charted within the top-twenty and also received a gold certification.|$|E

2500|$|Pusio is {{etymologically}} related to puer, and means [...] "boy, lad". It often had a distinctly sexual or sexually demeaning connotation.

2500|$|While {{performing}} {{her song}} [...] "Human Nature" [...] in her concert in Istanbul on June 7, 2012, Madonna briefly exposed her right breast to the audience, before covering it up again. The Sun notes, [...] "Her actions {{may have been}} offensive to some members of her audience, as Turkey is a traditionally Islamic country, with a largely Muslim population" [...] before noting that [...] "Perhaps fans shouldn't have been surprised - as she did warn them, writing No Fear on her back. [...] Amy Odell from BuzzFeed said that criticizing the gesture based on her age sends [...] "a very archaic message", adding that [...] "Women who are 53 still have breasts and... sex drives!". Three days later, The Sun published an article entitled, [...] "Madonna was right to bare her boob at 53." [...] Three readers of the publication recreated the pose, photographed it, and sent it in to the publication to show their support for Madonna [...] "as a positive role model for older women." [...] While some initially claimed Madonna as [...] "clingy" [...] and [...] "desperate", Sarah Angotti, also 53, counters, [...] "I felt nervous when I pulled my bra down but that’s only natural— Madonna probably did too. But then I felt empowered, {{it was an incredible}} feeling." [...] She goes on to say about Madonna, [...] "She looks incredible now— better <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> half her age and better than many of the young girls in the charts now" [...] before commenting on the criticism of Madonna exposing her breast as a parent, [...] "If she is a good mother that’s all that matters." [...] Tina Shaw, also 53, argues Madonna [...] "will not change" [...] despite a double-standard between men and women, opining, [...] "Women always seem to get the most flack when it comes to controversial situations. If it was a 53-year-old famous guy flashing his six-pack on stage, everyone would say, 'Wow, what a lad' but because it’s a woman everyone is saying, 'What an old bag'". Lastly, Sue Scadding, 53 as well, negates the controversy, pointing out that [...] "there are topless women out on the beach every day and nobody bats an eyelid...I mean, it’s only a nipple for goodness sake".|$|E
