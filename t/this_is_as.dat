5|$|A District Superintendent of Police, {{better known}} as a Superintendent of Police, heads the District Police {{organisation}} of West Bengal Police. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> per the Police Act of 1861, which is applicable to the whole of India. The Superintendents of Police are officers of the Indian Police Service. For every subdivision, there is a Subdivision Police, headed by a Police officer of the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police or Deputy Superintendent of Police. Under subdivisions, there are Police Circles, each headed by an Inspector of Police. A Police Circle consists of Police Stations, each headed by an Inspector of Police, or in case of rural areas, by a Sub-Inspector of Police.|$|E
5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in love. They want their love to be beautiful. If they give in to weakness, {{following}} the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), {{in the depths of}} their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love. As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may entail.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of the Pectinidae family, the Antarctic scallop is a {{suspension}} feeder, extracting its nourishment from the sea water that surrounds it. Bands of cilia on the velum, a curtain-like fold of the mantle, waft particles towards the gills. Oxygen is absorbed by the gills and food particles, mostly microscopic algae, are trapped in mucous and transported to the mouth by cilia. There is a seasonal increase in microscopic ice algae which become available to suspension feeders when the sea ice melts in the summer, and most of the annual growth takes place at this time. Research has shown that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> a result of the rise in sea temperature and not the greater availability of food.|$|E
50|$|Hardness {{increases}} with decreasing particle size. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> known <b>as</b> the Hall-Petch relationship. However, below a critical grain-size, hardness decreases with decreasing grain size. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> known <b>as</b> the inverse Hall-Petch effect.|$|R

25|$|In less {{advanced}} systems, {{this same}} effect {{is achieved by}} literally pre-heating (warming) the globes before an event or performance.

However, more complex tools require multiple steps from the programmed robot. For instance, some complex tools can have multiple conventional side pulls that mate with the core to add rigidity to the core and reduce the core mass. After the core is loaded and the press closed the plastic is shot.|$|E
