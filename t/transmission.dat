5|$|One of {{the biggest}} current {{challenges}} to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new <b>transmission</b> lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states {{in the middle of}} the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current <b>transmission</b> lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy. As <b>transmission</b> lines become longer the losses associated with power <b>transmission</b> increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances. However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new <b>transmission</b> lines. Multi state power <b>transmission</b> projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve <b>transmission</b> projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so. Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the <b>transmission</b> capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the <b>transmission</b> capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.|$|E
5|$|Programs {{to prevent}} the {{vertical}} <b>transmission</b> of HIV (from mothers to children) can reduce rates of <b>transmission</b> by 92–99%. This primarily {{involves the use of}} a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding. If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe, mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants; however exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case. If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out, the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of <b>transmission.</b> In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child <b>transmission</b> of HIV.|$|E
5|$|Risk of <b>transmission</b> {{increases}} {{in the presence of}} many sexually transmitted infections and genital ulcers. Genital ulcers appear to increase the risk approximately fivefold. Other sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis, are associated with somewhat smaller {{increases in}} risk of <b>transmission.</b>|$|E

5|$|The most {{frequent}} mode of <b>transmission</b> of HIV is through {{sexual contact with}} an infected person. Globally, the most common mode of HIV <b>transmission</b> is via sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex; however, the pattern of <b>transmission</b> varies among countries. As of 2014, most HIV <b>transmission</b> in the United States occurred among men who had sex with men (83% of new HIV diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 67% of total new diagnoses). In the US, gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men. About 15% of gay and bisexual men have HIV while 28 percent of transgender women test positive in the US.|$|E

To maintain its <b>transmission</b> system performance, TransÉnergie sets aside funds for research and application of new technologies. In addition to power <b>transmission</b> technology, Hydro-Québec plans to offer high-speed internet over its <b>transmission</b> lines within a few years; the utility started testing internet over its lines in January 2004.|$|E
