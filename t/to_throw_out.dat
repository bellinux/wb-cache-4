5|$|Johnson was {{selected}} by the Detroit Lions {{in the first round}} as the second pick overall in the 2007 NFL Draft. This is the highest a Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket has ever been drafted. The Lions were expected to trade Johnson, most likely to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but the team announced that they were keeping him. The next day, the Detroit Tigers invited him <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> the ceremonial first pitch.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund {{took the}} {{customary}} oath of the Transylvanian monarchs on 23December 1588. Pope Sixtus V excommunicated {{him for the}} expulsion of the Jesuits. Sigismund's cousin, Cardinal Andrew Báthory, urged the pope to lift the ban, saying that the prince's Protestant advisors had forced him <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> the friars. The pope authorized Sigismund to employ a confessor in May 1589, and the excommunication was revoked on Easter 1590.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{gameplay}} issues when the player takes {{their turn to}} bat. The AI is not developed and, when the player hits a pitch, it nearly always takes the longest possible route to the ball, making runs easier to score. It also lacks the capability <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> a runner who is returning to a base (instead of advancing) or perform a double play after catching a fly ball. Furthermore, the batter can only move vertically, not horizontally, in the batter's box.|$|E

5|$|Four of the This Year in Baseball Awards {{also went}} to the Phillies. Lidge was {{recognized}} as the Closer of the Year, while Utley won the Postseason Moment of the Year award for his fake throw to first base which allowed him <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> Rays' shortstop Jason Bartlett at home plate during the World Series. Manager Charlie Manuel and general manager Pat Gillick were also named Manager of the Year (distinct from Major League Baseball's Manager of the Year award) and Executive of the Year, respectively, for their leadership of the 2008 team and for winning the World Series.|$|E
5|$|On 4 November 2010, Stabæk Holding {{stated that}} they were near a bankruptcy, and that they {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> Stabæk as a tenant, remove the turf and instead use the venue exclusively for events. Chair Diderik Schnitler in Stabæk Holding stated that the business model was not sustainable. The football schedule was not made until early in the year, while in the event business, bookings were common {{one to two years}} in advance. It was therefore difficult to secure lucrative events, as large parts of the year had to be held in reserve in case the venue was needed for yet-to-be scheduled matches. The holding company {{stated that they}} might have to file for bankruptcy. Stabæk Fotball stated that they had a 40-year contract to use the venue.|$|E
5|$|On April 1, {{the defense}} {{asked for the}} new trial to be moved outside Brownsville, {{claiming}} their client had received unfair treatment {{in the media and}} there was no chance for her to have a fair trial and an unbiased jury. The request included large numbers of magazines and newspaper articles published since 1993. It did not cite any specific passages where the alleged media bias was demonstrated. The defense also filed a motion <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> the new indictment {{on the grounds that it}} was double jeopardy. On April 27, the judge decided to postpone his decision about where to hold the trial. He also rejected the defense motion stating that the new indictment was a case of double jeopardy. The defense argued that the prosecution had illegally used Brownsville and Houston grand juries to work on the case, but the judge countered that claim saying only the Houston grand jury had handled the case. On May 4, the trial was moved from Brownsville to Houston, Texas, because of the earlier extensive media coverage.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} {{afternoon}} of August 3, 2006, {{one of the hottest}} days of the year when air conditioning raised electricity consumption, downtown Stamford experienced a blackout after underground electricity cables on Summer Street overheated and caught fire.

25|$|Another {{example is}} the {{acquittal}} in 1989 of Michael Randle and Pat Pottle, who confessed in open court to charges of springing the Soviet spy George Blake from Wormwood Scrubs Prison and smuggling him to East Germany in 1966. Pottle successfully appealed to the jury to disregard the judge's instruction that they consider only whether the defendants were guilty in law, and assert a jury's ancient right <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> a politically motivated prosecution, in this case compounded by its cynical untimeliness.|$|E

25|$|Garratts {{enjoy an}} {{advantage}} over the Mallet system, because of the geometry of the design. When swinging around curves the boiler and cab unit move inward like a bowstring in the bow of a curve and this reduces the centrifugal force that would overturn a normal locomotive and which in turn permits faster running. The Mallet's forward articulated unit tends <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> as the loco rounds curves. While most Garratts were designed for freight or mixed traffic, there were several passenger Garratt classes. A Garratt holds the world speed record for an articulated locomotive.|$|E
25|$|Elliott {{also set}} an {{unprecedented}} NASCAR record of winning five consecutive pole qualifying sessions in that season; the June Pocono race, the Firecracker 400, the July races in Pocono and Talladega, and the August Michigan race. That {{did not include}} the June Michigan race where qualifying was rained out, and the July Pocono race pole was where he started second, but further investigation led NASCAR <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> the winning pole time for illegal fuel additives, retroactively awarding Elliott the pole award, money, and credit towards the season-long award for most poles won.|$|E

Then Muslim qazi told the emperor not to do harm to shivaling. Then in the late 18th century Scindians built a temple for that shivaling now popularly known as Koteshwar mahadev.|$|R
60|$|The {{scrambling}} of a {{crowd for}} money thrown thus among them, one would say, was a very rude and boisterous amusement, but those were rude and boisterous times.

By 11:00a.m. a large crowd—including police officers, emergency medical technicians, and residents of the village—had assembled both outside the schoolhouse and at a nearby ambulance staging area. County and state police dispatchers had briefly established telephone contact with Roberts as he continued to threaten violence against the children.|$|E
25|$|Plans {{called for}} retired pitcher and former National Liván Hernández <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> the {{ceremonial}} first pitch, but after Hurricane Matthew′s effects on Florida {{made it impossible}} for Hernández to fly to Washington, the Nationals surprised the fans at Nationals Park by having Nationals starting catcher Wilson Ramos – whose season had ended with a knee injury on September 26 – throw it instead, to a huge roar from the crowd. The game provided an historic first: When Dusty Baker and Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts exchanged line-up cards before the game, it became the first postseason game in the Major League Baseball history in which two African-American managers faced one another.|$|E
25|$|Tying the Series at a game a piece, Eagle's ace Masahiro Tanaka {{earned a}} victory in Game 2 by {{striking}} out 12 in his complete game performance. The game's first run came with Ginji Akaminai's RBI single for the Eagles in the sixth inning. In {{the bottom of the}} next inning, with runners on first and third, Kazuya Fujita hit a ground ball to second base. Giants' second baseman Takayuki Terauchi fielded the ball and threw it to first base in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> a head-first-sliding Fujita. First base umpire Kenjiro Mori called Fujita safe, however replays showed that he should have been out as the ball reached the base first. Giants' manager Tatsunori Hara came onto the field to argue the call with Mori but the call stood. Mori's blown call was exaggerated when Terauchi hit {{what should have been a}} game-tying solo home run the next inning.|$|E
