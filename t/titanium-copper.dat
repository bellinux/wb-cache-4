40|$|In spark plasma {{sintering}} (SPS) it {{is widely}} acknowledged that there are specific physicochemical mechanisms associated with atomic diffusion; however, a reaction diffusion rate coefficient K {{has yet to be}} determined. In this work, we derive the K of <b>titanium-copper</b> diffusion couples using isothermal heat treatment of pulsed electric current (PEC), generated in SPS system. Our results show that the derived K for CuTi and Cu 4 Ti is at least two times higher than the corresponding ones determined under conventional annealing. Accordingly, this work substantiates, for the first time, the argument that PEC accelerates atomic diffusion compared with conventional annealing...|$|E
40|$|Infection in {{external}} fixator pins {{is known to}} be a significant problem, with incidences between 3 % and 80 % reported in the literature. An infection occurs when planktonic bacteria adhere to {{external fixator}} pins and subsequently produce a biofilm which protects the bacteria from host defences. The most commonly implicated organisms are Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Once an infection occurs, treatment is difficult. Systemic antibiotics have limited benefits and considerable side-effects. The only definitive management is removal of the pin. This review will consider the current and potential future strategies for reducing pin site infection. Techniques to prevent infection must prevent bacterial adhesion, allow good osteointegration and have a low toxicity. Current areas of interest reviewed are <b>titanium-copper</b> alloys, nanosilver coatings, nitric oxide coatings, chitosan coatings, chlorhexidine and iodine, hydroxyapatite and antibiotic coatings. At present there is no consensus on the prevention of pin site infection, and there is a paucity of randomized controlled trials on which to draw a conclusion. Whilst a number of these strategies have potential future use, many of the above strategies need further studies in animal models to ensure no cytotoxicity and prevention of osteointegration. Following this, well-designed randomized controlled clinical trials are required to give future ways to prevent external fixator pin site infections. © 2013 Acta Materialia Inc...|$|E
40|$|Interaction between 5 mum thick {{copper and}} 50 nm thin {{titanium}} films was investigated {{as a function}} of annealing temperature and time using MeV He- 4 (+) Rutherford backscattering, X-ray diffraction and dynamic Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry. Samples were made by depositing 10 nm of titanium on a PECVD silicon oxynitride, followed by 50 nm of titanium nitride and 50 nm of titanium in the said order. In the same system 100 nm of copper were subsequently sputtered; finally 5 mum of copper were grown by electroplating. This complex structure was chosen in order to investigate the possibility of using copper interconnects also in power devices. To investigate the composition and growth of Ti-Cu compound on the buried interface, it was necessary to develop a special procedure. The results of the investigation show the formation of a laterally non-uniform layer of TiCu 4, which is presumably preceded by the formation of CuTi. The growth of the compound is kinetically controlled by means of a diffusion coefficient having 1. 7 eV activation energy and a 5 x 10 (- 2) cm(2) /s pre-exponential factor. The formation of a <b>titanium-copper</b> compound ensures a reliable and low resistance electrical contact especially at the vias. The Ti/TiN/Ti acts efficiently as a sacrificial and inert diffusion barrier. No copper was detected on the silicon oxynitride surface even after a 20 -min 500 degreesC heat treatment...|$|E
40|$|The most {{frequent}} complication in external fixation is pin tract infection. To {{reduce the incidence}} of implant-associated infection, many published reports have looked at preventing bacterial adhesion by treating the pin surface. This study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of a <b>Titanium-Copper</b> (Ti-Cu) alloy on implant infection, and to determine the potential use of the Ti-Cu alloy as a biomaterial. Two forms of Ti-Cu alloys were synthesized: one with 1 % Cu and the other with 5 % Cu. For analyzing infectious behavior, the implants were exposed to Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The reaction of pathogens to the Ti-Cu alloys was compared with their reaction to stainless steel and pure titanium as controls. Both Ti-Cu alloys evidently inhibited colonization by both bacteria. Conversely, cytocompatibility studies were performed using fibroblasts and colony formation on the metals was assessed by counting the number of colonies. Ti- 1 % Cu alloy showed no difference in the number of colonies compared with the control. External fixator pins made of Ti-Cu alloys were evaluated in a rabbit model. The tissue-implant interactions were analyzed for the presence of infection, inflammatory changes and osteoid-formation. Ti- 1 % Cu alloy significantly inhibited inflammation and infection, and had excellent osteoid-formation. Copper blood levels were measured before surgery and at 14 days postoperatively. Preoperative and postoperative blood copper values were not statistically different. Overall, it was concluded that Ti-Cu alloys have antimicrobial activity and substantially {{reduce the incidence of}} pin tract infection. Ti- 1 % Cu alloy shows particular promise as a biomaterial. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} focuses on phase {{stability}} and {{evolution in the}} titanium-zinc <b>titanium-copper</b> and titanium-antimony systems. The study utilized the Laser Engineering Net Shaping (LENS™) processing technique to deposit compositionally graded samples of three binary system {{in order to allow}} the assessment of phase stability and evolution as a function of composition and temperature the material is subjected to. Through LENS™ processing it was possible to create graded samples from Ti-xSb (up to 13 wt%) and Ti-xCu (up to 16 wt%). The LENS™ deposited gradient were solutionized, and step quenched to specific aging temperature, and the resulting microstructures and phase were characterized utilizing XRD, EDS, SEM, FIB and TEM. The Ti-Zn system proved incapable of being LENS™ deposited due to the low vaporization temperature of Zn; however, a novel processing approach was developed to drip liquid Zn onto Ti powder at temperatures above β transus temperature of Ti (882 ◦C) and below the vaporization temperature of Zn (907 ◦C). The product of this processing technique was characterized in a similar way as the graded LENS™ depositions. From measurements performed on Ti-Sb it seems that Sb could be a potential α stabilizer in Ti due to the presence of a mostly homogeneous α grains throughout the gradient; however, from XRD it can be understood that a titanium antimonide phase is present. From results obtained from the Ti-Zn samples, it can be surmised that the eutectoid reaction seems to be active, i. e. The eutectoid reaction is kinetically fast, as concluded by the presence of pearlitic structures. Finally, for the Ti-Cu system this work has been attempted to prove or disprove the existence of the Ti 3 Cu through the use of XRD and TEM SAD patterns. From XRD spectra collected there are peaks belonging to the Ti 3 Cu orthorhombic phase along with Ti 2 Cu and α-Ti phase. In addition to the Ti-Cu system displayed structures associated with divorced eutectoid decomposition mechanism, and at low undercooling seems to be prone to forming solid state dendrites...|$|E
