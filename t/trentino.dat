5|$|The rider {{considered}} {{most likely}} to challenge Contador for the general classification was Richie Porte (Sky). Porte had already achieved nine race victories in 2015, including the overall victories in Paris–Nice, the Volta a Catalunya and the Giro del <b>Trentino.</b> Porte {{was expected to be}} particularly strong in the individual time trial, {{as well as in the}} mountains. Porte had not shown consistent form in a Grand Tour in recent years, however, and there were doubts about his ability to maintain his form over a three-week race.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} sent squads to the Tour Down Under, the Tour of Qatar, the Tour of Oman, the Giro di Sardegna, Paris–Nice, the Volta a Catalunya, the Tour of the Basque Country, the Giro del <b>Trentino,</b> the Tour de Suisse, the Tour of Utah, Circuit Franco-Belge, and the Tour of Beijing, {{but did not}} achieve a stage win, {{classification}} win, or podium finish in any of them.|$|E
5|$|Bayern's main {{advertising}} {{partner and}} current holder of the jersey rights is Deutsche Telekom. The main supplier {{of the club}} is Adidas. The premium partners include Audi, HypoVereinsbank, Imtech, Lufthansa, MAN, Paulaner Brewery, Samsung, DHL and Yingli Solar. Classic sponsors include Coca-Cola, Siemens, Hublot, Henkel, Flyeralarm, Nestle Schoeller, Adelholzener, Fitness First, Schaeffler Group, s.Oliver, Viagogo, <b>Trentino,</b> Thomas Sabo and Starwood Hotels and Resorts. Food sponsors include Albi, BiFi, Ehrmann and MF. In previous years the jersey rights were held by Adidas (1974–78), Magirus Deutz and Iveco (trucks / 1978–84), Commodore (computers / 1984–89) and Opel (cars / 1989–2002).|$|E
5|$|In April, Contador {{claimed a}} convincing {{victory in the}} Vuelta al País Vasco, taking the race lead by winning the mountainous Stage 3 and {{dominating}} the final time trial. Though they did not race as Astana due to UCI rules, Armstrong, Leipheimer, and Chris Horner {{took part in the}} Tour of the Gila at the end of April and early May in what was Armstrong's first race back from the collarbone injury, with Leipheimer and Armstrong finishing in the top two places. With a squad made up of riders that normally ride in support for others, the team took a stage win (Klöden) and second overall (Janez Brajkovič) in the Giro del <b>Trentino,</b> also in April.|$|E
5|$|The {{team had}} a small measure of success winning lesser {{classification}}s at stage races, doing so at the Étoile de Bessèges, the Giro del <b>Trentino,</b> the Tour de Suisse, the Route du Sud, Paris–Corrèze, and the Tour du Poitou Charentes. The team also sent squads to the Tour de San Luis, the Tour Down Under, the Volta ao Algarve, the Three Days of West Flanders, Paris–Nice, Tirreno–Adriatico, the Volta a Catalunya, the Tour of the Basque Country, the Circuit de la Sarthe, the Tour de Romandie, the Circuit de Lorraine, Bayern-Rundfahrt, the Critérium du Dauphiné, the Eneco Tour, the Tour du Limousin, and Circuit Franco-Belge, but did not achieve a stage win, classification win, or podium finish in any of them.|$|E
5|$|Morchella frustrata fruit bodies grow solitary, scattered, or {{in small}} groups in spring, in mountainous forests and maquis. The exact trophic status of the fungus is not yet known with certainty, but it is {{suspected}} to be fucaltitive mycorrhizal or biotrophic. Tree species associated with the fungus include pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), oaks (Quercus spp.), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), and white fir (Abies concolor). In Europe it is often found with holm oak (Quercus ilex), strawberry trees (Arbutus andrachne), olive trees (Olea europaea), Spanish fir (Abies pinsapo), Silver fir (Abies alba) and Scot's pine (Pinus sylvestris). Although it was originally hypothesized that collections of M. frustrata from Turkey might have been recently introduced from North America, numerous collections reported since from remote and undisturbed areas in the Mediterranean and the Alps (including Bresadola's original collection from <b>Trentino),</b> suggest a long-time and well-established presence of this species in Europe. Kuo suggests {{that it might be}} also widely distributed in western North America, but so far has only been confirmed to be present in Oregon and California.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trentino</b> DOC {{is a large}} {{province}} wide DOC {{covering the}} entire province of <b>Trentino.</b> The Vin Santo from this area is unique in that the wine must be composed of 100% Nosiola – an obscure local grape grown little elsewhere. The wine must have a minimum alcohol level of 16% and be aged for at least 3 years.|$|E
25|$|Muscat blanc à Petits Grains {{has been}} {{identified}} as one of the parent grapes of several varieties, though with which crossing partner is currently unknown. These include the Italian wine grapes Aleatico, Moscato Giallo (Yellow Moscato), Moscato rosa del <b>Trentino</b> (Pink Moscato of <b>Trentino)</b> and Moscato di Scanzo. DNA analysis was able to identify the Tuscan wine grape Mammolo as the second parent variety that crossed with Muscat blanc à Petits Grains to produce Muscat rouge de Madère (Red Muscat of Madère).|$|E
25|$|The running event {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the similarly named Giro del <b>Trentino</b> – a road cycling competition which the city has hosted since 1963.|$|E
25|$|During this time, he {{published}} Il <b>Trentino</b> veduto da un Socialista (<b>Trentino</b> {{as seen by}} a Socialist) in the radical periodical La Voce. He also wrote several essays about German literature, some stories, and one novel: L'amante del Cardinale: Claudia Particella, romanzo storico (The Cardinal's Mistress). This novel he co-wrote with Santi Corvaja, and was published as a serial book in the Trento newspaper Il Popolo. It was released in installments from 20 January to 11 May 1910. The novel was bitterly anticlerical, and years later was withdrawn from circulation after Mussolini made a truce with the Vatican.|$|E
25|$|Germany and Austria-Hungary {{had only}} {{advanced}} {{the possibility of}} negotiating parts of the <b>Trentino</b> and Eastern Friuli, without Gorizia and Trieste. The offer of the French colony of Tunisia was deemed unsatisfactory.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, where Pinot noir {{is known}} as Pinot nero, it has {{traditionally}} been cultivated in South Tyrol, the Collio Goriziano, Franciacorta, Oltrepò Pavese, Veneto, Friuli and <b>Trentino.</b> It is also planted in Tuscany.|$|E
25|$|The Luco-Meluno culture {{originated}} in the transition period between the Bronze Age and the Iron Age and occupied <b>Trentino</b> and part of South Tyrol. It was succeeded, in the Iron Age, from the Fritzens-Sanzeno culture.|$|E
25|$|Italy's {{demands in}} the Paris peace {{settlement}} of 1919 were not fully achieved, Italy did attain <b>Trentino,</b> Trieste, the Istrian peninsula, and South Tyrol from Austria-Hungary, though other territories previously promised to Italy {{were not given}} to it.|$|E
25|$|After his death, Italy {{would gain}} Venice in 1866 {{in the course}} of the Third Italian War of Independence, {{connected}} to the Austro-Prussian War. The Capture of Rome completed the unification of Italy (aside from <b>Trentino</b> and Trieste) in 1870.|$|E
25|$|Born in Padua, Veneto, Toldo {{began his}} career with Milan in 1990. He never played a game with the Milan, however, being loaned during his stint with the club, {{successively}} to Hellas Verona (1990–91), <b>Trentino</b> (1991–92), and Ravenna (1992–93).|$|E
25|$|Campo 78 at Sulmona {{served as}} a POW camp in both world wars. During World War I, it housed Austrian prisoners {{captured}} in the Isonzo and <b>Trentino</b> campaigns; during World War II, it was home {{to as many as}} 3,000 British and Commonwealth officers and other ranks captured in North Africa.|$|E
25|$|In 1882 Italy {{joined with}} the German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire to form the Triple Alliance. However, even if {{relations}} with Berlin became very friendly, the alliance with Vienna remained purely formal, as the Italians were keen to acquire <b>Trentino</b> and Trieste, parts of the Austro-Hungarian empire populated by Italians.|$|E
25|$|Gardone Val Trompia is {{not only}} the Beretta Holding's {{headquarters}}, this comune is also headquarters for the enduring Fabbrica d’Armi Pietro Beretta company, as well as for Italian replica firearms company A. Uberti. Beretta Holding also holds two other Italian companies, Benelli Armi in Urbino and Meccanica Del Sarca in Pietramurata, <b>Trentino.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Laugen-Melaun culture, {{named after}} two {{important}} archaeological sites near the modern-day town of Brixen in South Tyrol, {{originated in the}} 14th century BC, {{in the area of}} today's South Tyrol and <b>Trentino.</b> It soon spread over the central area of the Southern Alps, encompassing South and East Tyrol, <b>Trentino</b> north of Rovereto and the Lower Engadine; the northern part of Tyrol came {{under the influence of the}} Urnfield culture. Distinguishing factors include its characteristic richly decorated pottery, while the metal-working is strongly influenced by adjacent cultures. As in the Urnfield culture, Laugen-Melaun-people cremated their dead, placing their ashes in urns, and worshipping their gods in sanctuaries sometimes situated in remote areas, on mountain-tops or close to water. Rich burial objects show that from the 13th to 11th century BC, the Laugen-Melaun culture (Laugen-Melaun A) flourished, due to the mining of copper, the source material for the alloy bronze.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} these prisoners were of Italian ethnicity, {{primarily}} from <b>Trentino,</b> Istria and Dalmatia (Italian nationalists considered these areas part of the Italia irredenta). The Italian government decided to form units from these prisoners (even because many of them declared to be Italian irredentists). They were allowed to fight for Italy and swore an oath to the King of Italy.|$|E
25|$|Adolf Hitler never claimed {{any part}} of the Southern Tyrol for his Third Reich, even before the {{alliance}} with Benito Mussolini; in fact in Mein Kampf (1924) he claimed that Germans were just a small and irrelevant minority in Southern Tyrol (this definition including also <b>Trentino)</b> and he acknowledged the German portion of Southern Tyrol as a permanent possession of Italy.|$|E
25|$|On the <b>Trentino</b> front, the Austro-Hungarians took {{advantage}} of the mountainous terrain, which favoured the defender. After an initial strategic retreat, the front remained largely unchanged, while Austrian Kaiserschützen and Standschützen engaged Italian Alpini in bitter hand-to-hand combat throughout the summer. The Austro-Hungarians counterattacked in the Altopiano of Asiago, towards Verona and Padua, in the spring of 1916 (Strafexpedition), but made little progress.|$|E
25|$|The Italian Risorgimento was {{initially}} {{concentrated in the}} Italian peninsula with the surrounding continental areas (Istria, Dalmatia, <b>Trentino,</b> Nizzardo, etc.) and did not reach Corfu and the Ionian islands. One of the main heroes of the Italian Risorgimento, the poet Ugo Foscolo, was born in Zante from a noble Venetian family of the island, but only superficially promoted the possible unification of the Ionian islands to Italy.|$|E
25|$|The {{proximity}} to Rome, the protected natural reserves and landscapes which award {{the region as}} the greenest in Europe, the presence {{of some of the}} most beautiful Italian villages, its rich and heterogeneous gastronomy along with a long history of deep-rooted local tradition and authentic Italian culture make Abruzzo rank fifth among the Italian regions by tourist arrivals after Calabria, Marche, Sardinia and <b>Trentino.</b> In 2010, arrivals totalled 6,381,067 Italian and 925,884 foreign.|$|E
25|$|In 1866, in {{coordination}} with the Third Italian War of Independence and Garibaldi's campaign against the Austrians in the <b>Trentino,</b> Türr was assigned to prepare an uprising in Hungary involving György Klapka and other Hungarian exiles. It {{was supposed to be}} launched from Serbian territory, but because of the fast ending of the Prussian-Austrian War including its Italian part, it never came to implementation, and the next year's developments rendered all such plans moot.|$|E
25|$|Twelve {{historical}} minority {{languages are}} legally recognised: Albanian, Catalan, German, Greek, Slovene, Croatian, French, Franco-Provençal, Friulian, Ladin, Occitan and Sardinian (Law number 482 of 15 December 1999). French is co-official in the Valle d’Aosta—although in fact Franco-Provencal is more commonly spoken there. German {{has the same}} status in South Tyrol as, {{in some parts of}} that province and in parts of the neighbouring <b>Trentino,</b> does Ladin. Slovene is officially recognised in the provinces of Trieste, Gorizia and Udine.|$|E
25|$|The corpse {{has been}} {{extensively}} examined, measured, X-rayed, and dated. Tissues and intestinal contents have been examined microscopically, as have the items found with the body. In August 2004, frozen bodies of three Austro-Hungarian soldiers killed during the Battle of San Matteo (1918) {{were found on the}} mountain Punta San Matteo in <b>Trentino.</b> One body was sent to a museum in the hope that research on how the environment affected its preservation would help unravel Ötzi's past.|$|E
25|$|New recruit Mikel Landa {{claimed his}} first overall win for team – taking the GC at the 2016 Giro del <b>Trentino</b> {{only a week}} after {{claiming}} his first stage win for the team. Landa's stated aim {{for the first half}} of the season is the Giro d'Italia. Froome added to Sky's race win total by successfully defending his Critérium du Dauphiné title after taking the overall lead with a victory on stage 5 to Vaujany, becoming the fifth rider to win the overall title three times.|$|E
25|$|The Saiman 202 was a {{two-seater}} monoplane single-engine military trainer; first {{flown in}} 1938, {{it was built}} in more than 400 units; these were operated by both the Regia Aeronautica and the Luftwaffe during the war and by the Aeronautica Militare {{after the end of the}} conflict. The Saiman 202M on display at the Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics was built in 1943 and remained in military service until 1951; it kept flying in the Aero Club Bologna until 1962. After being moved to <b>Trentino,</b> it was restored by Rovereto company, Masterfly.|$|E
25|$|During World War I Italy {{aligned with}} the Allies, instead of joining Germany and Austria. This could happen since the {{alliance}} formally had merely defensive prerogatives, while the Central Empires {{were the ones who}} started the offensive. With the Treaty of London, Britain secretly offered Italy <b>Trentino</b> and Tyrol as far as Brenner, Trieste and Istria, all the Dalmatian coast except Fiume, full ownership of Albanian Valona and a protectorate over Albania, Antalya in Turkey and a share of the Turkish and German colonial empire, in exchange for Italy siding against the Central Empires.|$|E
25|$|At the {{conclusion}} of World War I, the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye of 1919 ceded {{the southern part of}} Tyrol to the Kingdom of Italy, including present day-South Tyrol with its large German-speaking majority. The northern part of Tyrol was retained by the First Austrian Republic. The historical region is formed by the present-day Austrian State of Tyrol and the Italian provinces of South Tyrol and <b>Trentino.</b> The boundaries of this Tyrol–South Tyrol–Trentino Euroregion correspond to the former Habsburg County of Tyrol, which gave this historical region its name.|$|E
25|$|Squadriglia 91a of the Corpo Aeronautico Militare was {{established}} on 1 May 1917, drawing upon the existing 70a Squadriglia for its start. The new unit deployed to Istrana, near the ongoing Battles of the Isonzo, on 6 June 1917, {{with the objective}} of supporting ground action in the <b>Trentino.</b> It scored 14 victories within its first month of operations, largely because it included such experienced pilots as Francesco Baracca, Luigi Olivari, Ferruccio Ranza, and Fulco Ruffo di Calabria. Indeed, the 91a Squadriglia gained the nickname Squadriglia degli assi (Squadron of the aces).|$|E
25|$|Several {{minority}} and regional languages are legally recognized and protected, {{and they have}} co-official status alongside Italian {{in various parts of}} the country. French is co-official in the Valle d’Aosta—although in fact Franco-Provencal is more commonly spoken there. German has the same status in the province of South Tyrol as, in some parts of that province and in parts of the neighbouring <b>Trentino,</b> does Ladin. Slovene and Friulian are officially recognised in the provinces of Trieste, Gorizia and Udine in Venezia Giulia. Sardinian language was recognized as co-official in Sardinia.|$|E
25|$|The {{diplomatic}} moves {{led to the}} London Pact (26 April 1915), {{signed by}} Sonnino without {{the approval of the}} Italian Parliament. By the Pact, in case of victory Italy was to be given <b>Trentino</b> and the South Tyrol up to the Brenner Pass, the entire Austrian Littoral (with Trieste, Gorizia-Gradisca and Istria, but without Fiume), parts of western Carniola (Idrija and Ilirska Bistrica) and north-western Dalmatia with Zadar and most of the islands, but without Split. Other agreements concerned the sovereignty of the port of Valona, the province of Antalya in Turkey and part of the German colonies in Africa.|$|E
25|$|The Caproni Trento F.5 was a {{single-engine}} jet {{training aircraft}} that featured an entirely wooden and extremely light structure. It was flight tested with considerable {{success in the}} early 1950s, and the prototype was soon bought by the Italian Air Force. However, the serious financial difficulties of the Caproni company prevented it {{from being able to}} establish a production status. The aircraft kept flying {{until the end of the}} 1950s and was deeded to the Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics in 1990. It was restored in 1991 and is the only aircraft in the museum to have been built by Caproni in <b>Trentino.</b>|$|E
