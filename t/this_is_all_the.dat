25|$|Sumerian {{metallurgy}} and goldsmithing {{were highly}} developed. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more remarkable for {{a region where}} metals had to be imported. Known metals included gold, gold, silver, copper, bronze, lead, electrum, and tin. The use of binary, tertiary and quaternary alloys were already in use during the Uruk period. Sumerians used bronze, although the scarcity of tin meant that they used arsenic instead. Metalworking techniques included lost-wax casting, plating, filigree, and granulation.|$|E
25|$|In the {{relatively}} small and geographically dispersed Canadian market, magazines producing long-form journalism have often struggled to stay afloat. Saturday Night, which The Walrus editor John Macfarlane formerly published, lost money continuously despite being a celebrated publication. But as Macfarlane reports, The Walruss charitable model, {{similar to that of}} Harper's, is so far sustaining it: donations covered about half of the costs of producing the magazine in 2010, with the traditional revenue streams of circulation and advertising providing the rest. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more important for the magazine because its educational mandate requires that it keep a ratio of no less than 70 percent editorial content to 30 percent advertising.|$|E
25|$|Absent the use {{of trade}} to access resources, {{economic}} transactions were essentially intra-lineage obligations of labor. These lineages required a base level of self-sufficiency to achieve autarky. In the Andes, a long mountain range with {{a great variety of}} ecozones and resources, the need to access the proper lands for specific crops or animals meant lineages created miniature colonies or sent seasonal migration (such as transhumance) in different ecoregions. As the Andes are a relatively young mountain range, there is an especially great variation in waterfall and temperature, which has great importance for agriculture. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more important as only about 2% of the land in the Andes is arable.|$|E

25|$|The strong anthropic {{principle}} (SAP) as explained by John D. Barrow and Frank Tipler states that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> case because {{the universe is}} in some sense compelled to eventually have conscious and sapient life emerge within it. Some critics of the SAP argue {{in favor of a}} weak {{anthropic principle}} (WAP) similar to the one defined by Brandon Carter, which states that the universe's ostensible fine tuning is the result of selection bias (specifically survivor bias): i.e., only in a universe capable of eventually supporting life will there be living beings capable of observing and reflecting upon fine tuning. Most often such arguments draw upon some notion of the multiverse for there to be a statistical population of universes to select from and from which selection bias (our observance of only this universe, compatible with our life) could occur.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{a comment}} by Pausanias, who compares {{sacrificial}} practice in Olympia {{with that in}} Pergamon, {{this is the only}} written reference to the altar in all of antiquity. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more surprising because the writers of antiquity otherwise wrote a great deal about such works of art and Ampelius, after all, considered the altar {{to be one of the}} wonders of the world. The absence of written sources from antiquity about the altar has given rise to a number of interpretations. One possibility is that the Romans did not regard this Hellenistic altar as important since it did not date from the classic epoch of Greek, especially Attic, art. Only this art and later evocation of the associated values were considered significant and worth mentioning. This view was held particularly by German researchers starting in the 18th century, especially after the work of Johann Joachim Winckelmann became known. The only graphic representations of the altar are on coins of the Roman Empire, which show the altar in a stylized form.|$|E
2500|$|Although Cetus is not {{generally}} {{considered part of}} the zodiac, the ecliptic passes {{less than a quarter of}} a degree from its constellation boundary, and thus the moon, planets, and even part of the sun may be in Cetus for brief periods of time. [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more true of asteroids, since their orbits usually have a greater inclination to the ecliptic than the moon and planets. For example, the asteroid 4 Vesta was discovered in this constellation in 1807.|$|E
50|$|As well as {{the skills}} praised above, Crassus {{was said to have}} {{extensive}} knowledge of the Roman legal system. Cicero calls Crassus the 'ablest jurist in the ranks of orators', capable even of besting his (and Cicero's) former mentor, the great jurist Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur. Cicero also notes with admiration the intense preparation Crassus undertook before every case; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more necessary because Roman orators very rarely came into court with more than a few written notes with them.|$|R
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 18th century, Amsterdam was the fourth largest city in Europe, behind Constantinople (about 700,000), London (550,000) and Paris (530,000). <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more {{remarkable}} as Amsterdam was neither the capital city nor the seat of government of the Dutch Republic, which itself was a much smaller state than England, France or the Ottoman Empire. In contrast to those other metropolises, Amsterdam was also surrounded by large towns such as Leiden (about 67,000), Rotterdam (45,000), Haarlem (38,000), and Utrecht (30,000).|$|R
50|$|Edmund, then heir to his brother, earned infamy {{when he led}} the Butler Revolt in 1569. Alongside his {{brothers}} Edward and Pierce, Edmund's rebellion was in direct response to the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Henry Sidney who unjustly granted Edmund's lands in Idrone to the English adventurer Sir Peter Carew. Edmund and {{his brothers}} responded by raiding English settlements {{up and down the}} breadth of Leinster and were declared traitors by Sidney. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more remarkable because the Butlers had long been famed for their incredible loyalty to the Crown of England.|$|R
2500|$|When, at his Last Supper, Jesus said: [...] "This is my body", what he held in {{his hands}} still had all the {{appearances}} of bread: the [...] "species" [...] remained unchanged. However, the Roman Catholic Church teaches that, when Jesus made that declaration, the underlying reality (the [...] "substance") of the bread was changed into that of his body. In other words, it actually was his body, while all the appearances open to the senses or to scientific investigation were still those of bread, exactly as before. The Catholic Church holds that the same change of {{the substance of the}} bread and of the wine occurs at the consecration of the Eucharist when the words are spoken in persona Christi [...] "This is my body ... this is my blood." [...] In Orthodox confessions, the change is said to start during the Dominical or Lord's Words or Institution Narrative and be completed during the Epiklesis. Orthodox from the period of Dominican-Orthodox controversies (witnessed by Nicholas Cabasilas) until the Council of Florence and the [...] "libellus (booklet)" [...] of Mark of Ephesus, held for a double moment of consecration at the words [...] "This is my body/blood" [...] and the epiclesis. Despite {{the fact that this was}} a normative interpretation of the De sacraments and De mysteries of St. Ambrose, as early as Paschasius Radbertus (Ps.-Augustine), John Torquemada opposed the Orthodox position at the Council of Florence. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more ironic since he cited Paschasius Radbertus (as if Augustine) in his Sermo alter in the Acta Latina in order to refute emperor John VIII (who was relying on Mark of Ephesus [...] "libellus"). The end result was that, though authors from Radbertus until St. Bonaventure of Bagnoregio held for the consecratory potential of the epiclesis, Torquemada represented the Dominican position as universal and non-controversial among the Latins. In fact, Torquemada's overconfidence was the result of having studied the works of Pope Benedict XII in his debates against Mark of Ephesus in Ferrara in 1437. Therein, Benedict condemned an alleged Armenian theory (never verified among any of the dozen or so Armenian commentaries from the period) that denied all consecratory value to the words of institution and confined the consecration ONLY to the epiclesis (not the Byzantine position). Lastly, the Armenians were alleged to hold that the eucharistic change was not substantial and only imperfect and typological, and therefore not transubstantiation. The arguments, that Benedict XII's letter to the missionaries (c. 1340) addressed, relied on Aquinas' premises, which was no surprise given Benedict and Pope Clement VI thomistic preferences. However, these arguments were confused for the Byzantine position from Cabasilas to Florence and are still grossly misunderstood among modern and contemporary scholars when attempting to speak of Catholic-Orthodox differences.|$|E
