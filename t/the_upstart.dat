5|$|The Super Bowl {{began as}} an inter-league {{championship}} game between the AFL and NFL, an idea first proposed by Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt. This compromise {{was the result of}} pressures <b>the</b> <b>upstart</b> AFL was placing on the older NFL. The success of the rival league would eventually lead to a full merger of the two leagues.|$|E
5|$|In 1534, Tabinshwehti and {{his deputy}} Bayinnaung, {{then a couple}} of 18-year-olds, {{launched}} their first military campaign against Hanthawaddy. It {{was the first of}} a series of wars by Toungoo that would engulf western and central mainland Southeast Asia for the next 80 years. In 1538–39, <b>the</b> <b>upstart</b> kingdom captured Hanthawaddy's capital Pegu (Bago), and in May 1541, Martaban (Mottama) and Moulmein (Mawlamyaing). Significantly, for the first time, the Burmese and the Siamese shared a common border in the upper-Tenasserim coast.|$|E
5|$|In his MLB career, Kelley {{played in}} the National League (NL) for the Boston Beaneaters (1891), Pittsburgh Pirates (1892), Baltimore Orioles (1892–1898), and Brooklyn Superbas (1899–1901), before he jumped to <b>the</b> <b>upstart</b> American League {{to play for the}} Baltimore Orioles (1902). He {{returned}} to the NL with Cincinnati Reds (1902–1906) and Boston Doves (1908). Kelley served as player-manager of the Reds (1902–1905) and Doves (1908). After extending his career in the minor leagues, he coached the Brooklyn Robins (1926), and scouted for the New York Yankees (1915–1916).|$|E
5000|$|Soon after, the [...] "Child's Play" [...] arc begins, with <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts</b> {{going on}} {{what is called the}} Younghunt, a mission to capture all of the {{surviving}} New Mutants (who are by then called X-Force) and Hellions. This competition brings <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts</b> into conflict with the Warriors (Firestar is a former Hellion) and X-Force. <b>The</b> <b>Upstarts</b> capture most of their targets, but Paige Guthrie convinces the Gamesmaster to play another game: instead of killing mutants, <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts</b> should try to find and train young mutants like her. The Gamesmaster is intrigued and cancels the competition.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} few months, <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts</b> would try to kill as many mutants and other {{important}} people (like Moira MacTaggert) as possible, but with no success. In an attempt to reinvigorate the competition, the Gamesmaster started the Younghunt: the new targets were all surviving members of the New Mutants and Hellions. Instead of killing them, the Gamesmaster demanded that they should capture the targets. This competition brought <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts</b> into conflict with the New Warriors and X-Force. At the end of <b>the</b> game, <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts</b> had captured most of their targets, but Paige Guthrie convinced the Gamesmaster to play another game: instead of killing mutants, <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts</b> should try to find and train young mutants like herself. The Gamesmaster was intrigued and cancelled <b>the</b> competition. <b>The</b> <b>Upstarts</b> disbanded shortly afterwards.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Upstarts</b> {{continue}} their series of games {{to prove their}} power and worth to one another. This time, they devise [...] "the Younghunt", a mission to capture all of the surviving members of the New Mutants (some of who are now members of X-Force) and the Hellions. This competition also brings <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts</b> into conflict with the New Warriors (as Firestar is a former Hellion). <b>The</b> <b>Upstarts</b> acquire most of their targets, who are pitted against X-Force and the New Warriors during the crossover's climax. However, Paige Guthrie, who secretly followed X-Force on the rescue mission, is able to convince the Gamesmaster to play another game—instead of killing mutants, <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts</b> should compete with the mutant leaders {{of the world to}} try to find and train young mutants like herself. The Gamesmaster is intrigued by the proposition and cancels the competition.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} two years brought the Sipe era and the short-lived {{success of the}} Kardiac Kids to an end. Sipe returned to form in 1983, and the team narrowly missed {{a spot in the}} playoffs after a loss to the Houston Oilers in the second-to-last game of the regular season. Sipe signed {{before the end of the}} season to play for the New Jersey Generals, a team owned by real estate mogul Donald Trump in <b>the</b> <b>upstart</b> United States Football League.|$|E
5|$|Born in Muscotah, Kansas, Tinker {{began playing}} semi-professional {{baseball}} in Kansas {{in the late}} 19th century. He began his professional career in 1900 in minor league baseball and made his MLB debut with the Cubs in 1902. Tinker {{was a member of}} the Chicago Cubs dynasty that won four pennants and two World Series championships between 1906 and 1910. After playing one season with Cincinnati in 1913, he became one of the first stars to jump to <b>the</b> <b>upstart</b> Federal League in 1914. After leading the Whales to the pennant in 1915, he returned to the Cubs as their player-manager in 1916, his final season in MLB.|$|E
5|$|Kiprusoff {{was offered}} {{a spot on the}} Finnish team for the 2002 Winter Olympics, but {{declined}} citing a desire to focus on his professional career in North America. Kiprusoff was named the starting goaltender for the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, and earned a shutout against the Czech Republic. He posted four wins and a tie, including a second shutout, and a 1.18 GAA to lead <b>the</b> <b>upstart</b> Finns into the championship game against Canada. In spite of his 30 saves, the Finns were defeated by Canada 3–2. Kiprusoff did not play his best game in the final, according to Finland Head Coach Raimo Summanen, though he expressed pride in his team's effort.|$|E

50|$|At some point, the Gamesmaster was {{contacted}} by the immortal sorceress Selene, then Black Queen of the Hellfire Club and together they organized <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts,</b> a competition for wealthy and powerful individuals with {{the sole purpose of}} killing mutants for points in a twisted game. He agreed, if only to provide a distraction from the constant chatter in his mind. By focusing on the ambitious and powerful thoughts of <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts,</b> <b>the</b> Gamesmaster was able to somewhat drown {{out the rest of the}} world.|$|R
50|$|The twins later {{resurface}} {{as part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts,</b> a {{group of}} mutant millionaires who engage in a campaign of murder {{as part of a}} game organized by the mutant telepath Gamesmaster and the Hellfire Club's former Black Queen Selene. The twins tried to acquire Omega Red for <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts</b> but failed. <b>The</b> twins ultimately met their match, though, when they tried to kill the former New Mutant Wolfsbane. Wolfsbane and the X-Factor team easily beat the twins.|$|R
5|$|Since {{before the}} start of the American Revolution, Boston and New York City have shared an intense rivalry as cities. For more than a century after its founding, Boston was arguably the educational, cultural, artistic, and {{economic}} power in the United States. Boston's location as the closest American port to Europe and its concentration of elite schools and manufacturing hubs helped maintain this position for several decades. During this time period, New York was often looked down upon as <b>the</b> <b>upstart,</b> over-populated, dirty cousin to aristocratic and clean Boston.|$|E
5|$|The 1972–73 saw {{upheaval}} at the Bruins. Coach Sinden {{became the}} general manager. Bruins players Gerry Cheevers, Derek Sanderson and Johnny McKenzie joined <b>the</b> <b>upstart</b> World Hockey Association. Coach Tom Johnson was fired fifty-two games into the season, replaced by Bep Guidolin, {{who had once}} coached Orr. The Adams family, which had owned the team {{since its founding in}} the 1920s, sold it to Storer Broadcasting. The Bruins' season came to a premature end in a first-round loss in the 1973 playoffs, losing Esposito to injury in that first round. Orr amassed 101 points during the regular season (he only played 63 games to due injury) but had only two points in the playoff loss.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the reign}} of Edward II was {{initially}} harmonious, he soon met with opposition from several of his earls and prelates. At {{the source of the}} discontent was the king's relationship with the young Gascon knight Piers Gaveston, who had been exiled by Edward I, but was recalled immediately upon Edward II's accession. Edward's favouritism towards <b>the</b> <b>upstart</b> Gaveston was an offence to the established nobility, and his elevation to the earldom of Cornwall was particularly offensive to the established nobility. A group of magnates led by Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, forced Gaveston into exile in 1308. By 1309, however, Edward had reconciled himself with the opposition, and Gaveston was allowed to return.|$|E
50|$|Shaw was {{a member}} of <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts,</b> a group made up of Siena Blaze, Graydon Creed, Fabian Cortez, Trevor Fitzroy and {{probationary}} members Andreas and Andrea Strucker (of Fenris). They were manipulated by the Gamemaster and originally Selene, but the group quickly turns against her. The group participates in an elaborate game, wherein they hunt and kill assigned targets for points. During one of these games, <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts</b> target <b>the</b> surviving members of the New Mutants and the Hellions, but are defeated by the combined forces of X-Force and the New Warriors..|$|R
5000|$|Selene {{ultimately}} was {{the deciding}} vote to vote Sebastian Shaw {{out of the}} Hellfire Club, when tension between Shaw and the newly recruited White King Magneto came to blows. Unknown to Magneto or Emma Frost, however, Selene had decided that she no longer had any need for the Club and began plotting its destruction by gathering an army of young mutants, {{with help from the}} mutant omnipath known as the Gamesmaster, calling them <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts.</b> Under her authority, <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts</b> engaged in a killing spree that led to many presumed deaths (Magneto, Sebastian Shaw, Donald Pierce, and the Reavers), mortal injuries (Emma Frost), and outright deaths (the Hellions). Selene manipulated her young followers with the promise of a game, where each murder committed would land them points that would ultimately lead to them being granted a prize, described as [...] "being {{the next best thing to}} immortality" [...] by the Gamemaster. However, with another writer change, Selene's involvement with <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts</b> was cut short as she herself was betrayed by Trevor Fitzroy. Selene was kept in a torture device that repeatedly ripped her flesh from her body (to attract the attention of the Gamesmaster, who took advantage of the situation to proclaim himself the new leader of <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts).</b> She would be freed by Amanda Sefton, though the torture left her weak and scarred.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Upstarts</b> {{were part}} of a secret {{competition}} founded by Selene, the Black Queen of the Hellfire Club, who wanted to test potential members for her own Inner Circle. Overseen by <b>the</b> Gamesmaster, <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts</b> would each try to kill as many mutants as possible and the Gamesmaster would award points based on the mutant's power, skills and general importance in the world. At times he would raise the value of certain mutants so that <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts</b> would all try to assassinate them. At other times Gamesmaster would also reward the death of non-mutants. To gain entry to <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts</b> competition <b>the</b> requirement was to kill a member of the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club, but later members were not required to do so; usually the Gamesmaster claimed that their participation would make the game more interesting. The member with the most points {{at the end of the}} competition would win [...] "the prize". It was never explicitly stated what the prize was (though a statement by Andrea Strucker in X-Men #4 and a notation on the back of the Upstarts' X-Men Series I trading card state that the prize was immortality), but it was inferred that the winner would gain control over the other contestants as well as gain a lot of power and influence.|$|R
5|$|With {{the money}} earned {{from the sale}} of the Richmond movie theater, Barrow {{purchased}} a one-quarter share of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Class-A Eastern League in 1900 from Arthur Irwin, and served as the team's manager. Irwin, hired to be the manager of the Washington Senators of the NL, brought his most talented players with him. Rebuilding the Maple Leafs, Barrow acquired talented players, such as Nick Altrock, and the team improved from a fifth-place finish in 1899, to a third-place finish in 1900, and a second-place finish in 1901. The Maple Leafs won the league championship in 1902, even though they lost many of their most talented players, including Altrock, to <b>the</b> <b>upstart</b> American League (AL).|$|E
5|$|The first {{championship}} came at {{the expense}} of the Los Angeles Lakers, which also saw the last appearance in the Finals for Magic Johnson. Billed as a showdown between the aging Johnson and <b>the</b> <b>upstart</b> Jordan, the Lakers won the first game, 93–91. For the rest of the series, Pippen guarded Johnson, allowing Jordan to attain a free scoring role to lead Chicago to ultimately taking the next four games. The Bulls returned to the Finals in the next year, pitted against Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers. Throughout the 1991–1992 season, Jordan and Drexler led their teams to the best records in their respective conferences, leading to several comparisons between the two players in anticipation of a postseason match-up. Chicago defeated the Trail Blazers in Game 1 by 33 points, a game notable for Jordan breaking the record for the most three-pointer in a first half, with six. Game 2 went into overtime, with the Trail Blazers outscoring the Bulls 18–7 in the final period to run away with the win. Game 3 and 4 were split between Chicago and Portland, respectively, but the Bulls took the final two games, clinching their second championship.|$|E

50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts</b> {{captured}} {{several young}} {{former members of}} the mutant trainee team the New Mutants and took them to the Gamesmaster's base in the Swiss Alps, their teammates in X-Force and the New Warriors attempted to rescue them. The Gamesmaster would have defeated them if not for the intervention of Paige Guthrie, the mutant sister of X-Force's Cannonball, who argued that a greater game would be to compete with Professor X, the telepathic founder of the X-Men, and others like him who hoped to find and guide the next generation of mutants. The Gamesmaster agreed and, after allowing the heroes to leave, disbanded <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts.</b>|$|R

25|$|For {{the next}} three years the Nationalist movement's earlier largely {{hands-off}} approach to the dirty grind of daily politics was replaced by dedicated effort to achieve practical results through immediate political action. The logic of the situation made <b>the</b> <b>upstart</b> reform movement around the Nationalist Clubs the natural ally of <b>the</b> <b>upstart</b> movement emerging around the People's Party, and the two organizations intermingled. Nationalist Club members joined their local People's Party organizations en masse while Bellamy attempted to consolidate this alliance by molding his new publication {{into one of the most}} important voices of the Populist movement in the Eastern United States.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{inexperience}} of {{its last}} ruler, the powerful kingdom was conquered by <b>the</b> <b>upstart</b> Taungoo Dynasty in 1539. The kingdom was briefly revived between 1550 and 1552. It effectively controlled only Pegu and was crushed by Bayinnaung in 1552.|$|E

5000|$|A {{member of}} <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts,</b> Trevor Fitzroy, sends reprogrammed Sentinels {{to destroy the}} Reavers, as they are a threat to mutants and Pierce (as the former White King) is worth a lot of [...] "points" [...] in the deadly game <b>the</b> <b>Upstarts</b> play. Only Lady Deathstrike and Cylla escape. Pierce has Gateway {{teleport}} him to the one responsible for {{the attack on the}} Reavers, but the Sentinels accompanying Fitzroy electrocute him. Despite his seeming demise, he later resurfaces, starts an anti-mutant hate group, and enlists several members. He reveals a plot to take militant terrorist actions against mutants and is thwarted by the X-Men. He is beaten by Wolverine in hand-to-hand combat. Very little of Pierce's human tissue remains, which explains how he was able to survive the massacre in Australia with only his head and portions of his upper torso intact.|$|R
