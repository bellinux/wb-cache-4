5|$|On January 28, 1905, {{an article}} {{ran in the}} Indianapolis News {{containing}} information {{on the origin of}} the seal, some of it dubious. The article received much attention and started an informal inquiry into the history of the seal, and namely to discover if the sun in the seal was rising or setting. Jacob Piatt Dunn, the preeminent Indiana historian of the time, consulted several history and arrived at the conclusion that <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> rising. Dunn cited the fact the state was young, and the mountains were to the east of the state, not the west—clearly indicating <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> rising.|$|E

5|$|Empire of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> given {{a limited}} release on December 11, 1987, before being wide {{released}} on Christmas Day, 1987. The film earned $22.24 million in North America, and $44.46 million in other countries, accumulating a worldwide total of $66.7 million, {{earning more than}} its budget but still considered a box office disappointment by Spielberg.|$|E
5|$|Hergé later {{concluded}} that the scene in which Tintin hoodwinked the Inca with his knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> implausible, suggesting that solar worshipers with a keen knowledge of astronomy like the Inca would have been {{well aware of the}} sun and its eclipses.|$|E
5|$|In Proto-Indo-European religion, <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> personified as {{the goddess}} *Seh2ul. Derivatives of this goddess in Indo-European {{languages}} include the Old Norse Sól, Sanskrit Surya, Gaulish Sulis, Lithuanian Saulė, and Slavic Solntse. In ancient Greek religion, the sun deity was the male god Helios, but traces {{of an earlier}} female solar deity are preserved in Helen of Troy. In later times, Helios was syncretized with Apollo.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{luminary}} of sect {{in a day}} chart (where <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> above <b>the</b> horizon) and the Moon is the luminary of sect in a night chart (when <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> below <b>the</b> horizon.) This distinction {{was crucial}} in determining {{the location of the}} astrological Lots--especially in Hellenistic astrology.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{scholars}} {{say that when}} <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> eclipsed, <b>the</b> moon covers it. <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> further away (lit. above) but the moon being nearer (lit. below), then the moon could not cover <b>the</b> <b>sun.</b> But since <b>the</b> opposite <b>is</b> true, <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> obstructed, its light is covered by that of the moon, and therefore a solar eclipse is caused. Just as, in gloomy weather, neither sun nor moon can be seen. When the edges contact, the two consume each other; when the two are concentric they face each other exactly covered and <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> nearly extinguished. That <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> and moon <b>are</b> in conjunction at times of new moon is simply one of the regulatories of the heavens.|$|R
5000|$|While stellar {{collisions}} {{may occur}} very frequently {{in certain parts}} of the galaxy, the likelihood of a collision involving <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> very small. A probability calculation predicts the rate of stellar collisions involving <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> 1 in 1028 years.For comparison, {{the age of the universe}} is of the order 1010 years.

5|$|The first comet whose orbit {{had been}} found to take it {{extremely}} close to <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> the Great Comet of 1680. This comet {{was found to have}} passed just 200,000km (0.0013AU) above the Sun's surface, equivalent to about half the distance between the Earth and the Moon. It thus became the first known sungrazing comet. Its perihelion distance was just 1.3 solar radii.|$|E
50|$|The {{features}} of Hipparchus <b>are</b> highlighted when <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> at low angles {{during the first}} and last quarter. At full Moon <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> directly overhead and the crater contours become more difficult to discern.|$|R
25|$|Due to the {{precession}} of the equinoxes the December solstice {{no longer}} takes place while <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> constellation Capricornus, {{as it did}} until 130 BCE, but the astrological sign called Capricorn begins with the solstice. The solstice now takes place when <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> constellation (not the sign) of Sagittarius. The sun's most southerly position, which is attained at the northern hemisphere's winter solstice, is now called the Tropic of Capricorn, a term which also applies to the line on the Earth at which <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> directly overhead at noon on that solstice. <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> now in Capricorn from late January through mid-February.|$|R
50|$|Under the {{tropical}} zodiac, <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> in Aquarius typically between January 20 and February 18, {{while under the}} Sidereal Zodiac, <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> in Aquarius from approximately February 15 to March 14, depending on leap year.|$|R
5|$|The play Raisin in <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> {{inspired}} by Lorraine Hansberry's {{time in the}} neighborhood after her father won the repeal of restrictive covenants.

50|$|The 1982 - 83 Phoenix <b>Suns</b> season <b>was</b> <b>the</b> 15th {{season for}} <b>the</b> Phoenix <b>Suns</b> of <b>the</b> National Basketball Association. <b>The</b> <b>Suns</b> <b>were</b> in <b>the</b> {{playoffs for the}} sixth {{consecutive}} season, extending a then-franchise record. <b>The</b> <b>Suns</b> <b>were</b> eliminated in <b>the</b> first round two games to one by the Denver Nuggets, a team they had beaten by the same margin a year earlier. <b>The</b> <b>Suns</b> <b>were</b> led by head coach John MacLeod and played all home games in Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum.|$|R
50|$|Each day for <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> {{like one}} {{lifetime}} for man. He is youthful, capable, and admired {{in the early}} stages of his lifetime, much like <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> admired in <b>the</b> early day. But as <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> sets and a man's aging gets the best of him, he is facing frailty and mortality, and those once concerned with man and <b>sun</b> <b>are</b> now inattentive. At night <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> forgotten. At death man is forgotten, unless he leaves a legacy in the form of a human son.|$|R

5|$|From {{at least}} the 4th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> worshipped as the god Ra, portrayed as a falcon-headed divinity surmounted by the solar disk, and {{surrounded}} by a serpent. In the New Empire period, the Sun became identified with the dung beetle, whose spherical ball of dung was identified with the Sun. In {{the form of the}} Sun disc Aten, the Sun had a brief resurgence during the Amarna Period when it again became the preeminent, if not only, divinity for the Pharaoh Akhenaton.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{his major}} {{interest}} was {{the theory of}} the continuous spectrum and his first published paper, in 1926, concerned the quantum theory of molecular band spectra. He developed a method to carry out calculations of its transition probabilities. He calculated the photoelectric effect for hydrogen and X-rays, obtaining the absorption coefficient at the K-edge. His calculations accorded with observations of the X-ray absorption of the sun, but not helium. Years later it was realized that <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations were indeed correct.|$|E
5|$|Najmabadi observes a {{parallel}} symbolism on wall hangings produced between the lion/sun and Reza Khan/motherland, after Reza Khan's successful coup. The coy sun {{is protected by}} the lion and Rezakhan is the hero who should protect the motherland. Under Reza Shah the sun's female facial features were removed and <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> portrayed more realistically and merely with rays. In the military contexts the Pahlavi crown {{was added to the}} motif.|$|E
5|$|The Sun's {{color is}} white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), {{when viewed from}} space or when <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> high in <b>the</b> sky. When {{measuring}} all the photons emitted, <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> actually emitting more photons in the green portion of the spectrum than any other. When <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> low in <b>the</b> sky, atmospheric scattering renders <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> yellow, red, orange, or magenta. Despite its typical whiteness, most people mentally picture <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> as yellow; <b>the</b> reasons for this {{are the subject of}} debate.|$|R
50|$|The {{relationship}} {{between man and}} sun in sonnet 7 <b>is</b> metaphysical. <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> center of our being, but is also an object of desire.

40|$|Abstract. The {{properties}} of a rocky planet’s host star {{may be associated}} with the origin of life and the evolution of observers on that planet. By comparing <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> to other stars in our Galaxy, {{we may be able to}} identify such properties. If our <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> a typical star, stellar conditions appropriate for life, and life itself, may be common in the Universe. On the other hand, if <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> atypical or even unique, then the life orbiting <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> may also <b>be</b> atypical or unique. Here we present the comparison between <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and stars for three important parameters that {{may be associated with}} the origin and evolution of life. We find that: i) <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> more massive than 95 ± 2 % of nearby stars. ii) <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> younger than 53 ± 2 % of stars in the Galactic disk. iii) <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> more metal rich than 65 ± 2 % of nearby stars. 1...|$|R
5|$|Nri people {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> the dwelling place of Anyanwu (Light) and Agbala (Fertility). Agbala was the collective spirit of all holy beings (human and nonhuman). Agbala {{was the perfect}} agent of Chukwu or Chineke (the Creator God) and chose its human and nonhuman agents only by their merit; it knew no politics. It transcended religion, culture and gender, and worked with the humble and the truthful. They believed Anyanwu, The Light, to be the symbol of human perfection that all must seek and Agbala was entrusted to lead man there.|$|E
5|$|Prisoners of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> a {{commercial}} success and {{was published in}} book form by Casterman the year following its conclusion. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Land of Black Gold, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The two-part adventure was adapted into the 1969 film, Tintin and the Temple of the Sun by Belvision Studios, the first feature-length animated Tintin film. Prisoners of the Sun has also been adapted into two episodes of the 1990s television series The Adventures of Tintin, a video game, and a 2001 musical stage production.|$|E
5|$|Solar deities play a {{major role}} in many world {{religions}} and mythologies. The ancient Sumerians believed that <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> Utu, the god of justice and twin brother of Inanna, the Queen of Heaven, who was identified as the planet Venus. Later, Utu was identified with the East Semitic god Shamash. Utu was regarded as a helper-deity, who aided those in distress, and, in iconography, he is usually portrayed with a long beard and clutching a saw, which represented his role as the dispenser of justice.|$|E
