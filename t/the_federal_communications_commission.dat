5|$|The PTC began {{attracting}} {{more attention}} after it filed around 65,000 complaints to <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Commission</b> (FCC) about the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, {{in which one}} of performer Janet Jackson's nipple shielded breasts, was exposed for 9/16ths of a second.

5|$|A planned 2013 sale of WCLG (and its sister-station WCLG-FM) by Bowers Broadcasting Corporation {{was halted}} by <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Commission</b> (FCC) {{due to a}} {{complaint}} that the company buying the stations, AJG Corporation, has close connections with another local broadcaster, West Virginia Radio Corporation.

5|$|Aubrey, {{who left}} CBS with $2.5 million in network stock, {{moved to the}} Sunset Strip {{and set up a}} {{production}} company, The Aubrey Company. His attorney, Gregson E.

Aubrey was to have run ABC after the takeover, but the reclusive Hughes refused to testify in person at hearings before <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Commission,</b> which had to approve the purchase, and the deal collapsed.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, WOR's {{official}} city of license {{was changed}} to New York. Within two years, the Colonial Network's affiliate roster and shares in Mutual had been fully absorbed into the Yankee Network by John Shepard III; WNAC was the sole flagship, WAAB having been moved to Worcester, in central Massachusetts, to avoid duopoly restrictions. With WBZ taking over the slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston, WNAC switched to Mutual. In January 1943, <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Commission</b> (FCC) approved {{the sale of the}} Yankee Network—with WNAC, its three other owned-and-operated stations, its contracts with 17 additional affiliates, and its Mutual shares—to the Ohio-based General Tire and Rubber Company.|$|E

5|$|First-run Lassie was {{televised}} September 12, 1954 to March 24, 1973 {{with its}} first 17 seasons airing on CBS Sundays at 7:00p.m. EST. In 1971, {{in order to}} promote community-related programming among local affiliates, <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Commission</b> moved primetime Sundays to 8:00 P.M. EST with the institution of the Prime Time Access Rule. CBS executives felt Lassie would not be well received in a time slot other than its traditional 7:00p.m. slot, and, with the network's other family programs set, the show was canceled. (Lassie was among several shows that CBS canceled during this time period as part of a change in its target demographics.) Lassie then entered first-run syndication with Jack Wrather and Campbell's Soup still on board, and remained on the air for another two years with its final episode airing in March 1973. All totaled, 591 episodes were produced.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1964, charges were printed in the April 16 issue of Close-Up, a celebrity tabloid, which claimed Aubrey was taking kickbacks from producers. <b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Commission</b> made inquiries, and CBS learned that despite his $264,000 annual salary from the company, Aubrey's {{apartment}} on Manhattan's Central Park South was owned by Martin Ransohoff, the head of Filmways, the producer of the Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction, Mister Ed, and other CBS programs. And though he had a chauffeur-driven car {{paid for by the}} network, Brasselle's Richelieu Productions was paying for another chauffeured car for Aubrey, done so Paley and Stanton would not know what Aubrey was doing after hours. CBS had not known of either the apartment or the car. The company was also concerned about the money spent to buy Gleason's former home.|$|E

5|$|The first local {{marketing}} {{agreement in}} North American television {{was formed in}} 1991, when the Sinclair Broadcast Group purchased Fox affiliate WPGH-TV in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As Sinclair had already owned independent station WPTT (now MyNetworkTV affiliate WPNT) in that market, which would have violated FCC rules {{which at the time}} had prohibited television station duopolies, Sinclair decided to sell the lower-rated WPTT to the station's manager Eddie Edwards, but continued to operate the station through an LMA (Sinclair eventually repurchased the station – then assigned the call letters WCWB – outright in 2000, after <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Commission</b> began permitting common ownership of two television stations in the same market, creating a legal duopoly).|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 65 ABC affiliates—28% of the network—did not clear the {{available}} timeslot for the film, {{even with the}} offer of The Walt Disney Company, ABC's parent, to pay all fines for language to <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Commission.</b> In the end, however, no complaints were lodged against ABC affiliates who showed Ryan, perhaps because even conservative watchdogs like the Parents Television Council supported the unedited rebroadcast of the film. Additionally, some ABC affiliates in other markets that were near affected markets, such as Youngstown, Ohio, ABC affiliate WYTV (which is viewable {{in parts of the}} Columbus, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh markets, none of which aired the film) and Gainesville, Florida, ABC affiliate WCJB-TV (which is viewable in parts of the Orlando and Tampa markets), still aired the film and gave those nearby markets the option of viewing the film. TNT and Turner Classic Movies have also broadcast the film.|$|E
5|$|DuMont {{struggled}} to get its programs aired {{in many parts of}} the country, in part due to technical limitations of network lines maintained by the telephone company AT Corporation. During the 1940s and 1950s, television signals were sent between stations via coaxial cable and microwave links which were owned by AT The service provider did not have enough cable lines and microwave circuits to provide signal relay service from all four networks to all of their affiliates at the same time, so AT allocated times when each network could offer live programs to their affiliates. In 1950, AT allotted NBC and CBS each over 100 hours of live prime time network service, but gave ABC only 53 hours, and DuMont just 37. AT also required each television network to lease both radio and television lines. DuMont was the only television network without a radio network, but was forced to pay for a service it did not use. DuMont protested AT's actions with <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Commission,</b> and eventually received a compromise.|$|E

5|$|PTC {{was founded}} in 1995 by {{longtime}} political activist L. Brent Bozell III. Bozell is a prominent conservative activist who has, among other things, served as Executive Director of the Conservative Victory Committee, a political action committee that has supported the election of dozens of conservative candidates {{over the past ten}} years. He was also National Finance Chairman for Pat Buchanan's 1992 presidential campaign, and later president of the National Conservative Political Action Committee. Bozell was succeeded as PTC President by Timothy F. Winter. Winter served as Executive Director of the PTC for three years prior to becoming president. Prior to joining the PTC, Mr. Winter's 20-year career as a media executive included positions with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and NBC. Until 2015 when his position was terminated, Dan Isett, Director of Corporate and Government Affairs of the PTC, represented the PTC on the Consumer Advisory Committee of <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Commission.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Paramount Television Network aired several programs, {{including}} the Emmy Award-winning children's series Time for Beany. Filmed in Hollywood, the programs {{were distributed to}} an ad-hoc network of stations across the United States. The network signed affiliation agreements with more than 50 television stations in 1950; despite this, most of Paramount's series were not widely viewed outside the West Coast. <b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Commission</b> (FCC), which filed suit against Paramount for anti-trust violations, prevented the studio from acquiring additional television stations. Paramount executives eventually gave up {{on the idea of}} a television network, and continued to produce series for other networks. In 1995, after four decades of television production for other companies, Paramount re-entered the broadcast network field when the company and Chris-Craft Industries launched the United Paramount Network (UPN), a television network that operated until 2006. Paramount's television division is now owned by CBS Television Studios.|$|E
