50|$|<b>The</b> <b>city</b> of <b>Leverkusen</b> {{originally}} bid {{to become}} a venue for the 2006 World Cup, with an expanded BayArena as the site. However, <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> Bayer <b>Leverkusen,</b> and <b>the</b> German organizing committee soon agreed that expanding BayArena to the FIFA-mandated minimum 40,000 capacity for World Cup matches would not be practical, and <b>the</b> <b>city</b> withdrew its bid. Instead, {{it was agreed that}} BayArena would be the main training facility for the German national team during the 2006 finals. Jürgen Klinsmann, former national coach, however decided against Leverkusen and opted for Berlin as the main training facility. As compensation, BayArena would supposedly host two national matches, though they were never played.|$|R

40|$|Objective: We {{evaluated}} {{whether the}} incidence of amputations in one German <b>city</b> (<b>Leverkusen,</b> population approximately 160, 000) had decreased between 1990 and 2005. Research Design and Methods: From all three hospitals in <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> we obtained complete lists of nontraumatic lower-limb amputations in 1990 / 1991 and 1994 – 2005. Only the first observed amputation in residents of Leverkusen was counted. 692 patients met the inclusion criteria. Data about the population stucture, separately for each year of the observation period, were received from <b>the</b> <b>city</b> administration and <b>the</b> Federal Office of Statistics. To test for time trend, we fitted Poisson regression models. Results: Of all subjects, 72 % had known diabetes, and 58 % were male. Mean age was 71. 7 years. Incidence rates in the diabetic population (standardized to the estimated German diabetic population, per 100, 000 persons per year) varied considerably between years (maximum 549 in 1990, minimum 281 in 2004). In the diabetic population, the estimated relative risk (RR) per year was 0. 976 (CI: 0. 958, 0. 996; p= 0. 0164). The same trend was observed when only amputations above the ankle (n= 352; RR= 0. 970; CI: 0. 943, 0. 997; p= 0. 0318) were considered. Over 15 years...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE — A {{reduction}} of diabetes-related amputations {{by at least}} one-half within 5 years was declared a primary objective for Europe (St. Vincent Declaration, 1989). We collected data about incidence rates of amputations in one German <b>city</b> (<b>Leverkusen,</b> with a population of; 160, 000 inhabitants) between 1990 and 1998 to ascertain a potential change in rates of incidence. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — From all three hospitals in Leverkusen, we obtained complete lists of lower-limb amputations. From each patient record, diabetic status was determined. Only the first observed amputation was counted for the analysis. We estimated incidence rates of amputations in the entire population, the diabetic population, and the non-diabetic population. To test for time trend, we fitted Poisson regression models, adjusting for age and sex. RESULTS — During the defined period (the years 1990, 1991, and 1994 – 1998), 339 patients (all residents of Leverkusen) without previous amputations had nontraumatic lower-limb am-putations. Of all subjects, 46 % were female. Moreover, 76 % of the subjects were known to have diabetes. Mean age was 71. 3 years. Incidence rates in the diabetic population (standardized to the estimated German diabetic population, per 100, 000 person-years) were as follows: 1990...|$|R
