5|$|Another {{application}} of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently {{is used to}} reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose <b>that</b> <b>S</b> is a partially ordered set. One way of proving a statement about the objects of S is to assume {{the existence of a}} counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of S contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the minimal counterexample. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counterexample, there is a smaller counterexample.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, Goodwin {{and colleagues}} {{considered}} Ornatotholus a juvenile S. validum, therefore a junior synonym. In 2000, Robert M. Sullivan referred S. edmontonensis and S. brevis to the genus Prenocephale (until then only {{known from the}} Mongolian species P. prenes), and found it more likely <b>that</b> <b>S.</b> bexelli belonged to Prenocephale than to Stegoceras, but considered it a nomen dubium (dubious name, without distinguishing characters) due to its incompleteness, and noted its holotype specimen appeared to be lost. In 2003, Thomas E. Williamson and Thomas Carr considered Ornatotholus a nomen dubium, or perhaps a juvenile Stegoceras. In a 2003 revision of Stegoceras, Sullivan agreed that Ornatotholus was a junior synonym of Stegoceras, moved S. lambei to the new genus Colepiocephale, and S. sternbergi to Hanssuesia. He stated that the genus Stegoceras had become a wastebasket taxon for small to medium-sized North American pachycephalosaurs until that point. By this time, dozens of specimens had been referred to S. validum, including many domes too incomplete {{to be identified as}} Stegoceras with certainty. UALVP 2 is still the most complete specimen of Stegoceras, upon which most scientific understanding of the genus is based.|$|E
5|$|S. Paranavitana {{offered a}} novel surmise {{explaining}} {{the origins of}} the Ariyacakravarti. According to him the Aryacakravarti are descendants of Chandrabhanu a Malay chieftain, who invaded the island from Tambralinga in 1247. According to him refugees and immigrants from the Indian kingdom of Kalinga founded similarly named Kingdoms in South East Asia, and some of them came due to various reasons to north Sri Lanka and founded the Jaffna Kingdom. This view has been refuted by noted Indian historian K.A. Nilakanta Sastry as having no credible evidence, and other historians such as Louis Charles Damais (1911–66), an expert on Indonesian studies, Yutaka Iwamoto (1910–88), a Buddhist scholar, and S. Pathmanathan. They assert that there were no kingdoms in South East Asia called Kalinga and such assertions are based on erroneous readings of the Chinese name for a locality called Ho-ling which actually stood for Walain not Kalinga. Further S. Pathmanathan asserts that Chandrabhanu had categorically claimed Padmavamsa lineage whereas S. Paranavitana had adduced a Gangavamsa lineage to the Aryacakravarti. Further he notes that the inscriptions <b>that</b> <b>S.</b> Paranavitana used to make his theory have not been deciphered by any other scholar to imply a Javaka connection to the Aryacakravartis.|$|E

40|$|A 260 -kDa {{structural}} {{cell wall}} protein was purified from sodium dodecyl sulfate-treated cell walls of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by incubation with Rarobacter faecitabidus protease I, {{which is a}} yeast-lytic enzyme. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that this protein {{is the product of}} the SED 1 gene. SED 1 was formerly identified as a multicopy suppressor of erd 2, which encodes a protein involved in retrieval of luminal endoplasmic reticulum proteins from the secretory pathway. Sed 1 p is very rich in threonine and serine and, like other structural cell wall proteins, contains a putative signal sequence for the addition of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. However, the fact <b>that</b> <b>Sed</b> 1 p, unlike other cell wall proteins, has six cysteines and seven putative N-glycosylation sites suggests <b>that</b> <b>Sed</b> 1 p belongs to a new family of cell wall proteins. Epitope-tagged Sed 1 p was detected in a β- 1, 3 -glucanase extract of cell walls by immunoblot analysis, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>Sed</b> 1 p is a glucanase-extractable cell wall protein. The expression of Sed 1 p mRNA increased in the stationary phase and was accompanied by an increase in the Sed 1 p content of cell walls. Disruption of SED 1 had no effect on exponentially growing cells but made stationary-phase cells sensitive to Zymolyase. These results indicate <b>that</b> <b>Sed</b> 1 p is a major structural cell wall protein in stationary-phase cells and is required for lytic enzyme resistance...|$|R

40|$|Cell proliferation, {{growth and}} {{survival}} are three different basic processes which converge at determining a fundamental property –the size of an organism. Scalloped (Sd) is the first characterised transcriptional partner to Yorkie (Yki), the downstream effector of the Hippo pathway which is a highly potential and evolutionarily conserved regulator of organ size. Here we have studied the hypomorphic effect of sd {{on the development of}} Mushroom Bodies (MBs) in Drosophila brain. We show <b>that,</b> <b>sd</b> non-function results in an increase in the size of MBs. We demonstrate <b>that,</b> <b>sd</b> regulation on MB size operates through multiple routes. Sd expressed in the differentiated MB neurons, imposes non-cell autonomous repression on the proliferation of MB precursor cells, and Sd expression in the MB neuroblasts (NB) cell autonomously represses mushroom body neuroblast (MBNB) proliferation. Further Sd in Kenyon cells (KCs) imparts a cell autonomous restriction on their growth. Our findings are distinctive because, while the classical sd loss of function phenotypes in eye, wing and lymph gland are reported as loss of tissue or reduced organ size, the present study shows <b>that,</b> <b>Sd</b> inactivation in the developing MB, promotes precursor cell proliferation and results in an increase in the organ size...|$|R
