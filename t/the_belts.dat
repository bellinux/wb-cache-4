5|$|LeDuc {{had more}} success in Southeast Championship Wrestling after {{returning}} to the Tennessee area. He was pushed to win his first NWA Southeast Heavyweight Championship in a victory over Killer Karl Kox in March 1980 before losing the belt back to Kox in a rematch. In October, he regained the Southeastern Tag Team Championship while teaming with Robert Fuller. They lost <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> to Super Pro and Ron Bass, but LeDuc teamed with Armstrong again to regain <b>the</b> <b>belts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pugliese {{then joined}} the Buffalo, New York-based National Wrestling Federation (NWF). Once again, he found success teaming with Dominic DeNucci. The pair competed {{in a tournament}} for the vacant NWF World Tag Team Championship in January 1972; they {{made it to the}} final round but lost to the team of Mitsu Arakawa and Yoshino Sato. Pugliese and DeNucci {{continued}} to challenge for the title, and they defeated Arakawa and Sato in March to win <b>the</b> <b>belts.</b> They dropped <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> to Don and Johnny Fargo in May but regained them in a rematch the same month. Later that month, however, the Fargos regained <b>the</b> <b>belts.</b> Pugliese and DeNucci were unable to regain them, but Pugliese teamed up with Luis Martinez to win the title in December. Records are unclear as to whom they won <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> from and how they lost them.|$|E
5|$|The Beverly Brothers {{were unable}} to win the World Tag Team Championship, but the Steiners won <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> on two {{occasions}} in 1993. They feuded with Money Inc. (DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster), who had held <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> since the previous October, before winning their first championship on June 14.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{improve the}} {{calculation}} {{accuracy of the}} wrap angles, which are key parameters for the estimation of the maximum torque of <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> system, <b>the</b> steady configuration of <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> was researched. <b>The</b> governing equations and boundary conditions of <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> steady configuration were proposed and the following factors were considered in the model: the centrifugal force, the bending stiffness and the gravity of <b>the</b> <b>belt.</b> <b>The</b> <b>belt</b> steady configuration can be solved through a proposed iteration method based on the built model. The results show the gravity of <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> {{plays an important role}} on <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> steady configuration. <b>The</b> wrap angles calculated from the steady configuration are much less than that from the traditional geometric analysis. Thus the maximum torque of <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> system could be overestimated in <b>the</b> traditional <b>belt</b> design theory. It is necessary to calculate the wrap angles by solving <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> steady configuration, especially for the long center distance, high speed belt system...|$|R
5000|$|Once [...] "eligible", the wrestler may win {{the match}} by {{retrieving}} <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> and hanging {{it on the}} hook suspended above the ring {{with the aid of}} the ladders. An Impact official maintains possession of <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> and circles <b>the</b> ring, staying out of the action as much as possible. When a wrestler wishes to hang <b>the</b> <b>belt,</b> he must retrieve it from the official. Once <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> is in play, any other wrestler who is eligible may attempt to steal <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> and hang it. Once <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> has been dropped and no wrestler is attempting to hang it, a referee returns <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> to <b>the</b> official.|$|R
5|$|Wrestling in Tennessee in 1977, LeDuc {{teamed with}} Bob Armstrong {{to win the}} NWA Southeast Tag Team Championship in September. They were put over Bob Orton, Jr. and Mr. Knoxville for <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> but lost them in a rematch. While in Tennessee, LeDuc gained notoriety from a worked feud with Jerry Lawler. Wrestling as a heel, he faced Jerry Lawler, who was a {{favorite}} in the state, in many matches throughout the year. LeDuc was placed with a new partner, Jean Louie, to win the NWA Mid-America Southern Tag Team Championship in May. They faced Lawler and Jimmy Valiant on May 22 to defend <b>the</b> <b>belts,</b> but the match was declared a no contest and the title was vacated. Lawler and Valiant won <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> in a rematch the following week, but LeDuc and Louie regained them the following month. In September, LeDuc and Louie dropped <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> once again, this time to Lawler and the Mongolian Stomper.|$|E
5|$|For the Ladder match, the Intercontinental belts {{belonging}} to Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels were both hanging above the ring, {{and the first}} wrestler to use the ladder to reach both belts would be declared the winner. Ramon began the match by chokeslamming Michaels. Michaels recovered, however, and performed a neckbreaker on Ramon. Michaels then threw Ramon out to the ringside, where Michaels' bodyguard Diesel clotheslined Ramon. Referee Earl Hebner responded by ordering Diesel {{to return to the}} dressing rooms. Ramon pulled up the padding from the concrete floor, but he was later thrown onto it after Michaels reversed Ramon's attempt to perform the Razor's Edge. While Ramon was lying on the floor, Michaels brought the ladder to the ring and used it to hit Ramon in the stomach, chest and back. Michaels tried to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>belts,</b> but Ramon stopped him from climbing the ladder. Michaels then set the ladder up {{in the corner of the}} ring and performed a splash onto Ramon. Ramon recovered and Irish whipped Michaels into the ladder. He then hit Michaels with the ladder several times before both men tried to climb up to get <b>the</b> <b>belts.</b> Ramon suplexed Michaels off the ladder and tried to reach <b>the</b> <b>belts.</b> Michaels dropkicked the ladder, which caused Ramon to fall off. Michaels performed a superkick and a piledriver on Ramon and then propped the ladder up in the corner of the ring. Michaels climbed the turnbuckles, jumped onto the ladder, and used his weight to push it down across Ramon's chest. Michaels tried to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> again, but Ramon pushed him off. Michaels fell into the ropes and got tangled up, allowing Ramon to get <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> and win the undisputed Intercontinental championship.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1991, Paul E. Dangerously {{formed the}} faction The Dangerous Alliance. Eaton {{joined the group}} when he {{assisted}} Rick Rude, whom Dangerously had (kayfabe) brought into WCW, in defeating Sting for the United States Championship. In joining the group, Eaton became allies with Rude, Larry Zbyszko, and his two former rivals for the World Television Championship in Arn Anderson and Steve Austin. Shortly after the group was formed, Anderson and Eaton became its tag team specialists. This seemed to make sense, as both men had been successful tag team wrestlers in their careers; Anderson himself had been a two-time world champion teaming with Tully Blanchard in the Four Horsemen and had also won <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> with Zbyszko earlier in the year. Eaton and Anderson quickly won the WCW World Tag Team Championship by defeating Ricky Steamboat and Dustin Rhodes, the team to whom Anderson and Zbyszko lost <b>the</b> <b>belts,</b> for the championship and held on to <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> for five months before they lost them to the Steiner Brothers.|$|E
50|$|A {{conveyor}} pulley is {{a mechanical}} device used {{to change the}} direction of <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> in a conveyor system, to drive <b>the</b> <b>belt,</b> and to tension <b>the</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|R
50|$|The witch proclaims {{that the}} only thing Dorothy is good for is {{firewood}} as she turns the girl into a wooden statue. Bortag resolves to get <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> and flies in on Drox, who tries to scoop <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> off <b>the</b> witch. <b>The</b> <b>belt</b> gets caught on her shoes as Drox disappears, turning into a cloud. Bortag and the witch fall and fight for <b>the</b> <b>belt,</b> tearing up <b>the</b> Scarecrow in the process. Bortag comes out with <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> and turns <b>the</b> witch to stone. He restores the others and flies away with <b>the</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{misalignment}} {{causes the}} greatest damage to <b>the</b> conveyor <b>belt.</b> As {{a result of}} the interaction of <b>the</b> moving <b>belt</b> with <b>the</b> stationary parts of the conveyor, the sides of <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> wear intensively. This results in reducing the life of <b>the</b> <b>belt.</b> <b>The</b> reasons for this phenomenon are well investigated, but the difficulty {{lies in the fact that}} they all act simultaneously. <b>The</b> <b>belt</b> misalignment prevention can be carried out in two ways: by minimizing the effect of causes and by aligning <b>the</b> <b>belt.</b> <b>The</b> construction of aligning devices and errors encountered in practice are considered in this paper. Self-aligning roller supports rotational in plan view are recommended as a means of combating <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> misalignment...|$|R
5|$|LeDuc {{returned}} to Florida in 1978 {{and was given}} a title reign as the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship after defeating Mr. Uganda on December 18. He held the belt for two weeks before dropping it to his old kayfabe rival Dick Slater. He was soon a champion again, however, as he and Thor the Viking were booked to win the NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship in early 1979. They dropped <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> to Killer Karl Kox and Jimmy Garvin, but LeDuc soon regained the title by teaming with Pak Song. LeDuc and Song vacated the title shortly after winning it, but LeDuc teamed with yet another partner, Don Muraco, to win <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> back later that year.|$|E
5|$|Much of Pugliese's later {{career was}} spent wrestling as Tony Parisi in the Montreal-based Lutte Internationale (also known as International Wrestling). He {{traveled}} throughout the province, competing {{primarily as a}} tag team wrestler. In 1982, he teamed with Gino Brito to win the Canadian International Tag Team Championship from Gilles Poisson and Sailor White. Although they dropped the title to Pierre Lefebvre and Michel Dubois, {{they were able to}} regain <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> the following January from Lefebvre and Pat Patterson. Lefebvre teamed with Billy Robinson to win the title back, but Parisi and Brito won the title for the third time on December 12, 1983 from then-champions Lefebvre and Patterson. Once again, Lefebvre took on a new partner, this time Frenchy Martin, to win <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> from Parisi and Brito the following month. Parisi's final reign with the title began on February 20, 1984, when he joined up with Dino Bravo to regain <b>the</b> <b>belts.</b> Their title reign lasted for several months before Lefebvre and Martin defeated Parisi and Bravo to win back the championship.|$|E
5|$|When St. John recovered, he and Lane {{faced the}} new champions and {{defeated}} {{them for the}} title on November 25. They defended the title against several team and entered into a feud with the Brisco Brothers (Jack and Jerry), who had held <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> together on seven previous occasions. This rivalry also included a singles match between St. John and Jack Brisco, in which their partners were handcuffed together outside of the ring to prevent interference. In March 1980, Jack Brisco teamed with Jim Garvin to win <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> from the Bombers. Lane and St. John had one final reign with the championship after defeating Garvin and Keirn, who was substituting for Brisco, on June 7, 1980. That summer, the Brisco Brothers regained <b>the</b> <b>belts,</b> after which the Blonde Bombers parted ways. St. John soon retired, and Lane focused on building {{a career as a}} singles wrestler in Georgia before forming several other tag teams. Later in his career, he teamed with former rival Steve Keirn to form The Fabulous Ones; he was also a member of The Midnight Express and The Heavenly Bodies.|$|E

5|$|Yokozuna {{held the}} WWF World Heavyweight Championship for over nine months before {{dropping}} the belt to Bret Hart. Shawn Michaels {{was stripped of}} the Intercontinental Championship in September 1993, which set up a battle royal in which Razor Ramon became the next champion. The Steiner Brothers continued to feud with Money Inc. over the WWF Tag Team Championship. They defeated DiBiase and Schyster the day after King of the Ring to win <b>the</b> <b>belts.</b> They held them for two days before losing them to Money Inc. Three days later, the Steiners regained <b>the</b> <b>belts,</b> which they held {{for the remainder of}} the feud.|$|E
5|$|After {{dropping}} the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship {{for a third}} and final time, the Blond Bombers began to challenge for the NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship. They defeated George Gulas and Ken Lucas to win <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> on December 15, 1979. While holding the title, they continued to feud with Gulas. When they attacked him one day, his estranged partner Bobby Eaton rescued him; Gulas and Eaton reunited as The Jet Set and defeated the Bombers to win the championship. Latham and Farris regained <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> in a rematch against The Jet Set but later dropped them to Rocky Brewer and Pat Rose. The Blond Bombers had one last reign with the Mid-America belts, as they defeated Eaton and Great Togo in July 1980. They held the title until September 3, when they lost a match to Robert Gibson and Don Fargo. After losing <b>the</b> <b>belts,</b> Farris left to compete in Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council. Upon returning to Tennessee, he found other partners and had two more reigns as an AWA Southern Tag Team Champion. Latham soon left Tennessee {{to compete in the}} World Wrestling Federation, where he held the WWF Tag Team Championship as Spot, a member of The Moondogs.|$|E
5|$|By extrapolating the now-eroded {{and tilted}} beds upward, geologists have {{determined}} that these mountains were several kilometers high.

5000|$|Conditions {{under which}} <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> and pulleys are {{operating}} - The friction between <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> and pulley may decrease substantially if <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> {{happens to be}} muddy or wet, as it may act as a lubricant between the surfaces. This also applies to extremely dry or warm conditions which will evaporate any water naturally found in <b>the</b> <b>belt,</b> nominally making friction greater.|$|R

5|$|Latham and Farris {{both made}} their wrestling debuts in 1976 and later {{signed with the}} Continental Wrestling Association (CWA). CWA owners Jerry Jarrett and Jerry Lawler paired Latham and Farris as a new {{incarnation}} of the Blond Bombers. Managed by Sergeant Danny Davis, the Bombers were the promotion's top heel tag team, Their first championship came on June 15, 1979, when they won an infamous match against Jerry Lawler and Bill Dundee in Tupelo, Mississippi. After the Blond Bombers controversially won the title, Lawler and Dundee attacked the new champions and fought {{with them in the}} concession stands. They soon dropped <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> to Robert Gibson and his real-life brother Ricky, but they regained them in a rematch later that summer. Meanwhile, the Fabulous Freebirds, who had been the region's number two heel tag team became faces and challenged the Bombers for <b>the</b> <b>belts.</b> They won the title from the Latham and Farris in September 1979, but the Bombers won a rematch to reclaim the championship.|$|E
5|$|Money Inc. {{lost the}} WWF Tag Team Championship to the Steiner Brothers on June 14, 1993. Money Inc. won <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> {{back in a}} rematch on June 16, but the Steiners won them again three days later.

5|$|Prior to teaming with Rex King, Steve Doll {{competed in}} Pacific Northwest Wrestling with partner Scott Peterson as the Southern Rockers. The team was {{fashioned}} after The Rock 'n' Roll Express, and Doll and Peterson held the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship together seven times. In 1989, Doll replaced Peterson with King. They won the tag team title by defeating Scotty the Body and The Grappler on August 26. After an inconclusive rematch on September 9, {{the title was}} vacated and another rematch was ordered; the Southern Rockers regained <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> one week later. They held the title until PNW ordered it vacated again on November 4 after a match against Brian Adams and Jeff Warner; once again, Doll and King won a rematch the following week to regain the championship.

50|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> usually {{continues}} {{to change its}} shape so that it eventually acquires the same shape as before being turned but in the opposite direction. Because of this, turning <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> again {{after a period of}} approximately one year was often necessary. This method is very time consuming and thus very costly since it involves cutting <b>the</b> <b>belt,</b> dismantling it from the press, turning <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> and re-installing it in the press followed by <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> joining operations (welding and grinding of the joint) and running-in procedures.All these operations also require equipment for handling <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> as well as special welding-jigs and skilled personnel for the joint-welding.Added to this is the loss of production during the operation - a stoppage in production of one week being not uncommon.The Steel Belt Shot Peening Process was developed as a superior solution to <b>the</b> <b>Belt</b> cross curvature problem.|$|R
50|$|Belt {{friction}} {{is a term}} {{describing the}} friction forces between a belt and a surface, such as a belt wrapped around a bollard. When one end of <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> is being pulled only part of this force is transmitted {{to the other end}} wrapped about a surface. The friction force increases with the amount of wrap about a surface and makes it so the tension in <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> can be different at both ends of <b>the</b> <b>belt.</b> Belt friction can be modeled by <b>the</b> <b>Belt</b> friction equation.|$|R
5|$|Pugliese and DeNucci next {{traveled}} to Florida, where they competed for Championship Wrestling from Florida, an NWA territory. They defeated Toru Tanaka and Dick Slater {{to win the}} NWA Florida Tag Team Championship in January 1975. Slater teamed with Johnny Weaver to win <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> back from Pugliese and DeNucci, however.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Royal Rumble, the 1–2–3 Kid and Bob Holly faced The Smoking Gunns. The Gunns won the match and the WWF Tag Team Championship.

5|$|The third {{match was}} The Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff) against The World's Greatest Tag Team (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas) in a Ladder {{match for the}} World Tag Team Championship. The goal is to climb a ladder and {{retrieve}} the title belts suspended above the ring. The Hardys had the advantage {{for most of the}} match, but as Jeff was climbing the ladder to try and grab <b>the</b> <b>belts,</b> Benjamin botched a springboard attempt. Benjamin kicked the ladder from underneath Jeff, however, to gain control. The Hardys regained the advantage by pushing the ladder as The World's Greatest Tag Team were climbing it, causing Benjamin to fall to the floor. Jeff Swanton bombed Haas as Matt climbed the ladder to get <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> and win.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Lapland Granulite <b>Belt</b> is an {{elongate}} and arcuate zone of granulite {{rock in the}} Cap of the North spanning {{areas within}} Norway, Finland and Murmansk Oblast in Russia. At most <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> is 80 km broad. The main rocks of <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> are migmatized greywacke and argillites. Studies of detrital zircon show that the sedimentary protolith of the metamorphic rocks of <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> could not be older than 2900-1940 million years. <b>The</b> <b>belt</b> has norite and enderbite intrusions of calc-alkaline chemistry.|$|R
25|$|In practice, the {{theoretical}} tension acting on <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> or rope calculated by <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> friction equation {{can be compared}} to the maximum tension <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> can support. This helps a designer of such a rig to know how many times <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> or rope must be wrapped around the pulley to prevent it from slipping.
