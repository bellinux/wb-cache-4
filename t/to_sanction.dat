5|$|Attitudes towards suicide slowly {{began to}} shift during the Renaissance. John Donne's work Biathanatos, {{contained}} {{one of the first}} modern defences of suicide, bringing proof from the conduct of Biblical figures, such as Jesus, Samson and Saul, and presenting arguments on grounds of reason and nature <b>to</b> <b>sanction</b> suicide in certain circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Cosimo {{recognised}} Philip, duc d'Anjou, as Carlos's successor, whose administration refused <b>to</b> <b>sanction</b> the Trattamento Reale {{reserved for}} the royal family. The Grand Duke, soon after the royal altercation, accepted the investure of the nominal Spanish fief of Siena from Philip, thereby confirming {{his status as a}} Spanish vassal.|$|E
5|$|A {{challenger}} to Planica {{arrived in}} 1949 {{with the construction}} of Heini-Klopfer-Skiflugschanze ("Heini Klopfer ski flying hill") in Oberstdorf, West Germany. Designed by former ski jumper turned architect Heini Klopfer, as well as then-active ski jumpers Toni Brutscher and Sepp Weiler, the hill had a K-point of 120m to match that of Bloudkova velikanka. The FIS, still wary of the rising popularity of ski flying and wanting to keep it in check, refused <b>to</b> <b>sanction</b> the construction of the hill, having previously denounced the 1947 and 1948 events in Planica.|$|E

5|$|In February 1884, the Impeachment {{trial of}} Prime Minister Christian Selmer and his entire cabinet was nearing its end. One {{of the last}} actions of Selmer's cabinet was to refuse <b>to</b> <b>sanction</b> a {{parliamentary}} money grant to the rifle associationthe liberals had won the 1882 parliamentary election in a landslide victoryfurther polarizing the situation. Rumours flew that personnel of the Norwegian Army were preparing for action at Kongsvinger Fortress, some miles northeast of Kristiania.|$|E
5|$|Most churches {{used two}} acts <b>to</b> <b>sanction</b> its members: censure and excommunication. Censure was a formal {{reprimand}} for behavior {{that did not}} conform with accepted religious and social norms, while excommunication involved full removal from church membership. Many perceived social evils, from fornication to public drunkenness, were dealt with through church discipline rather than through civil punishment. Church sanctions seldom held official recognition outside church membership and seldom resulted in civil or criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, such sanctions were a powerful tool of social control.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Prince finally {{succumbed to}} {{syphilis}} on 30 October 1713, sparking a succession crisis. Cosimo III deposited {{a bill in}} the Tuscan senate, the nominal legislature, provisioning for a male line succession failure by making the Electress Palatine Gian Gastone's heiress. It passed and was disseminated to chancelleries across Europe. Austria refused <b>to</b> <b>sanction</b> it, fearing that Tuscany would fall into the Bourbons' hands. However, France and England did.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Princess found herself, in 1702, in {{the middle}} of a protocolary spat between Tuscany and Spain. The Grand Duke sent an agent to the court of Philip V of Spain with the {{objective}} of procuring a license for the Grand Prince and Princess—who, hypothetically, acquired royal dignity with Cosimo III on 5 February 1691 from the Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I's, diploma—to use the style Royal Highness in correspondence with Spain. Philip V initially deigned only <b>to</b> <b>sanction</b> his aunt Violante Beatrice's use; however, the agent, Pucci, eventually requisitioned full recognition.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitutional}} amendment gave autonomy {{to the city}} of Buenos Aires, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>sanction</b> local laws and elect its own mayor, who was previously appointed {{by the president of the}} nation. De la Rúa was the first mayor elected in this manner, defeating the previous mayor Jorge Domínguez. During his term of office he created or reformulated several institutions to fit the new status of the city, as required by the national constitution and the recently approved Constitution of Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|A British {{horsewoman}} named Francesca Kelly {{founded a}} group called Marwari Bloodlines in 1995, {{with the goal of}} promoting and preserving the Marwari horse around the world. In 1999, Kelly and Raghuvendra Singh Dundlod, a descendant of Indian nobility, led a group that founded the Indigenous Horse Society of India (of which the Marwari Horse Society is part), a group that works with the government, breeders, and the public to promote and conserve the breed. Kelly and Dunlod also entered and won endurance races at the Indian national equestrian games, convincing the Equestrian Federation of India <b>to</b> <b>sanction</b> a national show for indigenous horses– the first in the country. The pair worked with other experts from the Indigenous Horse Society to develop the first breed standards.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{agricultural}} employers {{shifted their}} focus from opposition <b>to</b> employer <b>sanctions</b> <b>to</b> a concerted campaign to secure {{alternative sources of}} foreign labor. As opposition <b>to</b> employer <b>sanctions</b> waned and growers' lobbying efforts for extensive temporary worker programs intensified, agricultural worker programs began <b>to</b> outrank employer <b>sanctions</b> component as the most controversial element of reform.|$|R

5|$|In Bottomley's absence, {{his office}} {{explored}} {{the issue and}} resolved that Rhodesia could retain its representative in South Africa, but {{should not be allowed}} to appoint another in Lisbon; a consul was acceptable, they concluded, but only as part of the British Embassy staff. Bottomley remained unaware of this progress until a call from his office on 25 June, whereupon he still did nothing. Unwilling to wait, Rhodesia confirmed Reedman's appointment the next day, much to Wilson's fury. Only now was Bottomley finally jolted into action; he informed Salisbury of his ministry's findings on 29 June, offering them the consul within the embassy, but refusing <b>to</b> <b>sanction</b> an independent office.|$|E
5|$|Liddell debuted for Scotland in a 5–4 wartime {{win over}} England at Hampden Park, {{equalising}} Tommy Lawton's opening goal. He gained several more wartime caps. He gained {{his first full}} cap against Switzerland scoring twice in a 3-1 win at Hampden Park on 15 May 1946 At international level, Liddell played predominantly as an outside left, in competition with Scotland-based Lawrie Reilly and Willie Ormond. The Scottish Football Association (SFA) denied Liddell and his teammates {{the opportunity to participate}} in the 1950 World Cup, hosted by Brazil, because of an earlier decision not <b>to</b> <b>sanction</b> involvement as British Home Championship runners-up. The decision meant qualification depended on the final match against England on 25 May 1950, which Scotland lost 1-0 when joint-first needed only a draw. Despite pressure from players, the SFA maintained its position.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey and {{all other}} U.S. states comport with the {{requirement}} of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984, which sought to set a national standard of 21 as the minimum age for purchasing and publicly possessing alcoholic beverages. To make states comply, Congress tied a state's failure to enact a drinking age at 21 to a punitive decrease in a state's apportionment of federal highway funding. Federal law requires colleges and universities that accept federal financial aid institute policies <b>to</b> <b>sanction</b> students who violate underage drinking and other alcohol laws, and to track the number of liquor laws violations. The Chronicle of Higher Education has reported that many colleges fail to comply with these laws, and federal enforcement is minimal.|$|E

5|$|On 28 June, Model {{was sent}} to rescue Army Group Centre, which had been torn apart by Operation Bagration, the Soviet {{offensive}} in Belorussia. The Ninth Army (Model's old command) and Fourth Army were trapped, and the Red Army was about to liberate Minsk. Despite the catastrophic situation, Model believed that he could still hold Minsk, but this would require Fourth Army {{to break out of}} its pocket, and reinforcements to counter-attack the Soviet advance. The reinforcements, in turn, could only be obtained by pulling back, thus shortening the line and freeing up troops. The consensus is that the German position was doomed, regardless of what Model could have done, but Hitler refused <b>to</b> <b>sanction</b> either Fourth Army's escape or a general withdrawal, until it was too late.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of Windsor married Simpson, who {{had changed}} her name by deed poll to Wallis Warfield, in a private {{ceremony}} on 3 June 1937, at Château de Candé, near Tours, France. When the Church of England refused <b>to</b> <b>sanction</b> the union, a County Durham clergyman, the Reverend Robert Anderson Jardine (Vicar of St Paul's, Darlington), offered to perform the ceremony, and the Duke accepted. The new king, George VI, forbade {{members of the royal}} family to attend, to the lasting resentment of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Edward had particularly wanted his brothers the Dukes of Gloucester and Kent and his second cousin Louis Mountbatten to attend the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|While Article 34 of the {{constitution}} of Luxembourg formerly required the grand duke or duchess <b>to</b> <b>sanction</b> and promulgate a new law for it to take effect, the required sanction was removed in 2008, after Grand Duke Henri informed his prime minister {{that he could not}} in good conscience assent to a bill to permit euthanasia in the country. The subsequent constitutional amendment removed the need for assent while retaining the need for the Grand Duke to promulgate new laws. The Grand-Duke's signature is still required, but does not imply assent, only promulgation (announcement that the law has been enacted by Parliament). The Grand-Duke did sign the Euthanasia Act under this new constitutional arrangement.|$|E
50|$|India {{was subject}} <b>to</b> {{international}} <b>sanctions</b> after its May 1998 nuclear tests. However, {{due to the}} size of the Indian economy and its relatively large domestic sector, these sanctions had little impact on India, with Indian GDP growth increasing from 4.8% in 1997-1998 (prior <b>to</b> <b>sanctions)</b> <b>to</b> 6.6% (during <b>sanctions)</b> in 1998-1999. Consequently, at the end of 2001, the Bush Administration decided <b>to</b> drop all <b>sanctions</b> on India.Although India achieved its strategic objectives from the Pokhran nuclear tests in 1998, it continued to find its civil nuclear program isolated internationally.|$|R

5|$|Before 2000, MMA had {{a number}} of {{different}} rule sets, with each one differing in ruling on downward elbow strikes (12-6 elbows). In UFC 1, the first UFC event where there were very few rules, Kevin Rosier used 12-6 elbows on Zane Frazier. In 2000, the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts were drawn up {{to try to make the}} sport more mainstream. The meeting consisted of representatives of a number of major MMA organisations including Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), Pride Fighting Championships and International Fighting Championships (IFC) as well as doctors and referees in New Jersey, United States. In the meeting, doctors raised concerns about 12-6 elbows after seeing an IFC match where 12-6 elbows were used to the back of a fighter's head. One doctor argued that they could be life-threatening, and refused <b>to</b> <b>sanction</b> any set of rules that didn't prohibit them.|$|E
5|$|Fitzgibbons {{argues that}} it was not {{impossible}} for Cromwell's body to have been substituted before his posthumous execution. One proposition is that Sergeant Norfolke, who exhumed the bodies from the abbey, found the tombs of Cromwell and Ireton empty, prompting the government <b>to</b> <b>sanction</b> an exhumation of two other graves. This has been put forward because Bradshaw's body arrived at the Red Lion Inn at Holborn a day after Cromwell and Ireton, prompting rumour that he was the only real body to be hanged at Tyburn. An alternative theory is that Cromwell's friends bribed the guards attending Cromwell's body, “privately interring him in a small paddock near Holborn”, so that when the sledges dragged the bodies to the gallows, Cromwell's body was already buried. The faces on the three bodies, although heavily shrouded, were clearly visible; and since no witnesses expressed any doubt that the bodies were those of Cromwell and Ireton, there is no evidence supporting this theory.|$|E
5|$|Keen to {{strengthen}} Bolton for a European push in the 2006–07 season, Allardyce signed France international striker Nicolas Anelka from Fenerbahçe for a club record £8million. He also signed Ivory Coast defender Abdoulaye Méïté from Marseille, {{and in an}} unusual sequence of events made a £400,000 profit on Dietmar Hamann, who {{changed his mind about}} joining Bolton and signed with Manchester City a day after signing a pre-contract agreement with Bolton; Manchester City agreed to pay Bolton £400,000 in compensation. However Allardyce's relationship with chairman Phil Gartside became increasingly strained as Gartside refused <b>to</b> <b>sanction</b> greater transfer spending to finance a push for UEFA Champions League qualification. On 29 April 2007, Allardyce resigned with the club in fifth place with two games of the season left to play, and the following day his assistant Sammy Lee was announced as his replacement.|$|E
