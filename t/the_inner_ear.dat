5|$|Situated {{between the}} incus and <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear,</b> the stapes transmits sound {{vibrations}} from the incus {{to the oval}} window, a membrane-covered opening to <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear.</b> The stapes is also stabilized by the stapedius muscle, which is innervated by the facial nerve.|$|E
5|$|The {{round window}} {{allows for the}} fluid within <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> to move. As the stapes pushes the {{secondary}} tympanic membrane, fluid in <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> moves and pushes the membrane of the round window out by a corresponding amount into the middle ear. The ossicles help amplify sound waves by nearly 15–20 times.|$|E
5|$|After implantation, {{around the}} second to third week the {{developing}} embryo consists of three layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. The {{first part of the}} ear to develop is <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear,</b> which begins to form from the ectoderm around the 22nd day of the embryo’s development. Specifically, <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> derives from two thickenings called otic placodes {{on either side of the}} head. Each otic placode recedes below the ectoderm, forms an otic pit and then an otic vesicle. This entire mass will eventually become surrounded by mesenchyme to form the bony labyrinth.|$|E

40|$|An {{astonishing}} {{diversity of}} <b>inner</b> <b>ears</b> and accessory hearing structures (AHS) that can enhance hearing has evolved in fishes. <b>Inner</b> <b>ears</b> mainly {{differ in the}} size of the otolith end organs, the shape and orientation of the sensory epithelia, and the orientation patterns of ciliary bundles of sensory hair cells. Despite our profound morphological knowledge of <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> variation, two main questions remain widely unanswered. (i) What selective forces and/or constraints led to the evolution of this <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> diversity? (ii) How is the morphological variability linked to hearing abilities? Improved hearing is mainly based on the ability of many fish species to transmit oscillations of swim bladder walls or other gas-filled bladders to <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ears.</b> Swim bladders may be linked to <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ears</b> via a chain of ossicles (in otophysans), anterior extensions (e. g. some cichlids, squirrelfishes), or the gas bladders may touch <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ears</b> directly (labyrinth fishes). Studies on catfishes and cichlids demonstrate that larger swim bladders and more pronounced linkages to <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ears</b> positively affect both auditory sensitivities and the detectable frequency range, but lack of a connection does not exclude hearing enhancement. This diversity of auditory structures and hearing abilities is one of the main riddles in fish bioacoustics research. Hearing enhancement might have evolved to facilitate intraspecific acoustic communication. A comparison of sound-producing species, however, indicates that acoustic communication is widespread in taxa lacking AHS. Eco-acoustical constraints are a more likely explanation for the diversity in fish hearing sensitivities. Low ambient noise levels may have facilitated the evolution of AHS, enabling fish to detect low-level abiotic noise and sounds from con- and heterospecifics, including predators and prey. Aquatic habitats differ in ambient noise regimes, and preliminary data indicate that hearing sensitivities of fishes vary accordingly...|$|R
5|$|Compared with Giraffititan, <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> of A. sp. shows a more basal morphology. That {{feature is}} {{possibly}} {{related to a}} restricted range of possible movements that involve head-turning.|$|E
5|$|Hearing {{and balance}} are both {{generated}} in <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear.</b> The movement of liquids within <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> {{is generated by}} motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (for sound). This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From here, it passes through to the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it is hard}} to {{test the}} hearing of sharks, they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can {{possibly}} hear prey from many miles away. A small opening on each side of their heads (not the spiracle) leads directly into <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> through a thin channel. The lateral line shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. This is a reminder of the common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> has been lost.|$|E

5|$|During {{embryogenesis}} the ear develops {{as three}} distinct structures: <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear,</b> {{the middle ear}} and the outer ear. Each structure originates from a different germ layer: the ectoderm, endoderm and mesenchyme.|$|E
5|$|Inferences about {{behavior}} {{can also be}} drawn from examination of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear.</b> The semicircular canals within <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> aid in balance, and the lateral semicircular canal is usually {{parallel to the ground}} when the animal holds its head in an alert posture. When the skull of Majungasaurus is rotated so that its lateral canal is parallel to the ground, the entire skull is nearly horizontal. This contrasts with many other theropods, where the head was more strongly downturned when in the alert position. The lateral canal is also significantly longer in Majungasaurus than in its more basal relative Ceratosaurus, indicating a greater sensitivity to side-to-side motions of the head.|$|E

5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone. <b>The</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> is {{supplied}} by the anterior tympanic branch of the maxillary artery; the stylomastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery; the petrosal branch of middle meningeal artery; and the labyrinthine artery, arising from either the anterior inferior cerebellar artery or the basilar artery.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} lies between the outer ear and <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear.</b> It {{consists}} of an air-filled cavity called the tympanic cavity and includes the three ossicles and their attaching ligaments; the auditory tube; and the round and oval windows. The ossicles are three small bones that function together to receive, amplify, and transmit the sound from the eardrum to <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear.</b> The ossicles are the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup). The stapes is the smallest named bone in the body. The middle ear also connects to the upper throat at the nasopharynx via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube.|$|E

5|$|Hearing loss may {{be either}} partial or total. This {{may be a}} result of injury or damage, {{congenital}} disease, or physiological causes.

5|$|Tadpoles {{retain the}} lateral line system of their ancestral fishes, {{but this is}} lost in {{terrestrial}} adult amphibians. Some caecilians possess electroreceptors {{that allow them to}} locate objects around them when submerged in water. The ears are well developed in frogs. There is no external ear, but the large circular eardrum lies {{on the surface of the}} head just behind the eye. This vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone, the stapes, to <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear.</b> Only high-frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way, but low-frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism. There is a patch of specialized haircells, called papilla amphibiorum, in <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> capable of detecting deeper sounds. Another feature, unique to frogs and salamanders, is the columella-operculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals. The ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound.|$|E

Previous studies using conditional approaches in mouse and chicken have shown that Bmp 4 has a role in semicircular canal and crista development, but there is currently no direct evidence {{for the role of}} Bmp 2 in <b>the</b> developing <b>inner</b> <b>ear.</b> We have used an RNA rescue strategy to test the role of bmp 2 b in <b>the</b> zebrafish <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> directly. Injection of bmp 2 b or smad 5 mRNA into homozygous mutant swirl (bmp 2 b(-/-)) embryos rescues the early patterning defects in these mutants and the fish survive to adulthood. As injected RNA will only last, at most, for {{the first few days of}} embryogenesis, all later development occurs in the absence of bmp 2 b function. Although rescued swirl adult fish are viable, they have balance defects suggestive of vestibular dysfunction. Analysis of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>ears</b> of these fish reveals a total absence of semicircular canal ducts, structures involved in the detection of angular motion. All other regions of the ear, including the ampullae and cristae, are present and appear normal. Early stages of otic development in rescued swirl embryos are also normal. Our findings demonstrate a critical late role for bmp 2 b in the morphogenesis of semicircular canals in <b>the</b> zebrafish <b>inner</b> <b>ear.</b> This is <b>the</b> first demonstration of a developmental role for any gene during post-embryonic stages of otic morphogenesis in the zebrafish.
