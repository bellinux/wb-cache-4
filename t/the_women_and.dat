5|$|Darren Craig {{directed}} the song's music video, which Candy envisioned as a satire on political and socioeconomic repression {{of women and}} misogyny. In the video, Candy appears {{with a group of}} oppressed women who rise up against a tyrannical man and shoot him with golden rifles. The visual attracted critical attention from media commentators, who discussed the possible inspirations for <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> the setting. Critics positively responded to the music video, complimenting it as vibrant and outrageous.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, most of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> {{children}} had {{gathered in the}} sacristy of the church. As Mexican soldiers entered the room, a boy, {{thought to be the}} son of defender Anthony Wolf, stood up to rearrange a blanket around his shoulders. Mistaking him for a Texian soldier, the Mexican soldiers bayoneted him. In the confusion, {{at least one of the}} women was lightly wounded. Bowie's family, including Gertrudis Navarro, Juana Navarro Alsbury and her son, were hiding in one of the rooms along the west wall. Navarro opened the door to their room to signal that they meant no harm. A Mexican officer soon arrived and led the women to a spot along one of the walls where they would be relatively safe. All of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> children were eventually placed under the protection of an officer and escorted out of the Alamo and imprisoned in the home of the Musquiz family.|$|E
5|$|Himmler {{notified}} Fegelein by telegram on 1 August {{that the}} numbers killed were far too low. A few days later, Himmler issued regimental order no. 42, which called for all male Jews {{over the age of}} 14 to be killed. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> children were to be driven into the swamps and drowned. Thus Fegelein's units were among the first in the Holocaust to wipe out entire Jewish communities. As the water in the swamps was too shallow and some areas had no swamps, it proved impractical to drown <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> children, so they were shot. Fegelein's final report on the operation, dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, 699 Red Army soldiers, with 830 prisoners taken and losses of 17 dead, 36 wounded, and 3 missing. The historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700.|$|E

5|$|In west Serbia's {{region of}} Rađevina, {{centered}} on the town of Krupanj, the badnjak prepared for each household is cut into three logs, {{the most important of}} which is the dozemak—the log that comes from the part of the trunk that grew nearest to the ground. In Resava, Levač, Temnić, and Jadar of Serbia, as well as in Ozren and Romanija of Bosnia, the badnjak is cut into three logs associated respectively with the men, <b>the</b> <b>women,</b> <b>and</b> the children.|$|E
5|$|On 23 February 1852, Birkenhead docked {{briefly at}} Simonstown, near Cape Town. Most of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> {{children}} disembarked {{along with a}} number of sick soldiers.

There {{were not enough}} serviceable lifeboats for all the passengers, and the soldiers famously stood firm on board, thereby allowing <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> children to board the boats safely and escape the sinking.|$|E

5|$|The rebels {{moved into}} Magomero {{in the early}} evening, while Livingstone {{and his wife were}} {{entertaining}} some dinner guests. The estate official, Duncan MacCormick, was in another house nearby. A third building, occupied by Emily Stanton, Alyce Roach and five children, contained a small cache of weapons and ammunition belonging to the local rifle club. The insurgents quietly broke into the Livingstone's house and injured him during hand-to-hand fighting, prompting him to take refuge in the bedroom, where his wife attempted to treat his wounds. The rebels forced their way into the bedroom, and after capturing his wife, decapitated Livingstone. MacCormick, who had been alerted, was killed by a rebel spear. The attackers took <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> children of the village prisoner but shortly released them unhurt, having reportedly treated them well. It has been suggested that Chilembwe may have hoped to use <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> children as hostages, but this remains unclear. The attack on Magomero, and in particular the killing of Livingstone, had great symbolic significance for Chilembwe's men. The two Mauser rifles captured from the plantation formed the basis of the rebel armoury {{for the rest of the}} uprising.|$|E
5|$|When the {{interior}} wall fell, the men, true to their promise, {{sprang from the}} ruins and fought with great courage, forcing Philip to send his troops forward in relays to the front line. By nightfall the Macedonians retreated to camp.

5|$|A second {{emigrant}} ship—the Kennersley Castle, a merchantman docked at Leith, near Edinburgh—was {{hired by}} MacGregor in October 1822, and left Leith on 22 January 1823 with almost 200 emigrants aboard. MacGregor again saw the settlers off, coming aboard {{to see that}} they were well quartered; to their delight, he announced that since this was the maiden emigrant voyage from Scotland to Poyais, all <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> children would sail free of charge. The Cazique was rowed back to shore to rousing cheers from his colonists. The ship's captain Henry Crouch fired a six-gun broadside salute, hoisted the supposed flag of Poyais, then steered the ship out of port.|$|E
5|$|A second {{strategy}} was therefore suggested to the Allies by Themistocles. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Allies, despite the overwhelming number of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the allied navy could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual {{strategy was}} adopted by the congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> children of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E
5|$|About 60 Gilbertese {{civilians were}} {{relocated}} to Fanning island in January 1957 on the copra ship Tungaru, and another 40 on the Tulgai the following month.

By {{the end of}} April, 31 of the men, and all <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> children hadd been taken to Fanning Island by RAF Hastings. The civilians would remain there {{for the next three}} months, before returning to Christmas Island. During the later test series, the Gilbertese civilians remained on the island, marshalled in areas like the military personnel.|$|E
