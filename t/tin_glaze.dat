5000|$|Though {{the recipe}} of <b>tin</b> <b>glazes</b> may differ in {{different}} sites and periods, {{the process of}} the production of <b>tin</b> <b>glazes</b> is similar. Generally speaking, the first step of the production of <b>tin</b> <b>glazes</b> is to mix tin and lead in order to form oxides, which was then added to a glaze matrix (alkali-silicate glaze, for example) and heated. After the mixture cooled, the tin oxide crystallises as what has been mentioned above, therefore generates the so-called white tin-opacified glazes. Besides, the body of tin-opacified wares is generally calcareous clays containing 15-25% CaO, of which the thermal expansion coefficient is close to that of <b>tin</b> <b>glazes,</b> thus avoid crazing during the firing process. On the other hand, the calcareous clay fired in an oxidising atmosphere results in a buff colour, thus lower the concentration of tin oxide used ...|$|R
50|$|In this recipe, the {{addition}} of alkali helps to increase the hardness of the surface and clarify the colour of the glaze as well. With the development of <b>tin</b> <b>glazes,</b> the significant amount of tin oxide indicates its deliberate addition as an opacifier. A recipe involving the use of three ingredients was given in Abu’l-Qasim’s treatise from Persia in the 14th century: a glass-frit of quartz and potash, a lead-tin calx and a calcination of limestone and quartz. Afterwards, with the spread of <b>tin</b> <b>glazes,</b> lead gradually became the principal background in <b>tin</b> <b>glazes,</b> though {{a small proportion of}} alkali was still introduced in order to increase the fusibility. No specific recipes alluding to <b>tin</b> <b>glazes</b> in Spain have been found in ancient archives. However, recent research has shown that, at least since the 10th century AD, most Islamic white glazes in Spain were lead-silica <b>glazes</b> with <b>tin</b> oxide as an opacifier. That is, no alkaline glazes or lead-alkaline glazes have been found. Piccolpasso recorded several glazes used in Italy in the 1550s, all variations of lead, tin, lime, soda and potash glazes. It is believed early Spanish glazes were similar.|$|R

50|$|Tin-glazing is {{the process}} of giving ceramic items a tin-based glaze that is white, glossy and opaque, which is {{normally}} applied to red or buff earthenware. The opacity and whiteness of <b>tin</b> <b>glaze</b> encourage its frequent decoration with colour.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} tin-glazed pottery {{appears to}} have been made in Abbasid, Iraq (750-1258 AD)/Mesopotamia in the 8th century, fragments having been excavated during the First World War from the palace of Samarra about fifty miles north of Baghdad.

5000|$|Some {{research}} on medieval <b>tin</b> <b>glaze</b> {{has shown that}} the particle size of tin oxide which appears as cassiterite is around several hundred nanometer, which corresponds to the range of wavelength of visible light. In some cases, the tin oxide is presented not only as small crystals but also as aggregates of particles. These factors - the high refractive index, the low solubility in glazes and the particle size make tin oxide an excellent opacifier.|$|E
50|$|The {{interaction}} between glaze and body also give clues to different handling and firing processes. As mentioned above, <b>tin</b> <b>glaze</b> suspension {{is applied to}} bisque or biscuit body made of calcareous clay with high content of calcium oxide. This could be inferred from the absence of trapped glaze bubbles. If it is applied to an unfired body, the calcium carbonate will decompose, generating carbon dioxide, the releasing of which from the body to the glaze results in trapped bubbles in the glaze layers.|$|E
50|$|During {{the eighteenth}} and nineteenth century, it was mainly dishes for daily use and tiles that were made in the clay ovens. Around 1865, the demand for dishes decreased. The {{brothers}} Jelmer and Jan started a drastic innovation process, whereby the company could continue as a factory for decorative pottery. Throughout the ages, the company has retained the old working methods, working with locally dug clay that is covered in a white <b>tin</b> <b>glaze</b> after the first firing, called the Majolica technique. In 1882, the use of plaster moulds was introduced, increasing the assortment of decorative pottery.|$|E
5000|$|The {{recrystallisation}} of {{tin oxide}} during the firing provides {{evidence of the}} slightly different methods of different production sites, as the crystal size, the distribution and the concentration may be influenced.

50|$|The {{history of}} <b>tin</b> <b>glazes</b> in the Islamic world is disputed.

Another might be local glaze-making rather than foreign influence, supported by the similarility between the chemical and microstructural features of pre-Islamic white opaque glazes and that on the first tin-opacified waresFrom the Middle East, tin-glaze spread through the Islamic world to Spain. In the 13th century, <b>tin</b> <b>glazes</b> reached Italy, where the earliest recorded reference to their use is in the 1330s, resulting in the emergence of Italian Maiolica. Amongst others, Luca della Robbia, born in Florence circa 1400, used tin oxide as an opacifier in glazes. Potters began to draw polychrome paintings on the white opaque surface with metallic oxides such as cobalt oxide and to produce lustreware. The off-white fired body of Delftware and English majolica was made to appear white, and hence mimic the appearance of Chinese porcelain, by the application of a glaze opacified and coloured white by the addition of tin oxide.|$|R

5000|$|According to Grove Art, Alan Caiger-Smith {{established}} the Aldermaston Pottery in 1955, [...] "a cooperative workshop of about seven potters making functional domestic ware and tiles, {{as well as}} individual commissions and one-off pots.

[...] However, in Lustre Pottery, Caiger-Smith refers to earlier revivals of lustre by William de Morgan, Vilmos Zsolnay, Clément Massier and Pilkington's Royal Lancastrian Pottery. He was joined at Aldermaston Pottery by a number of other potters, including Geoffrey Eastop (1921-2014).|$|E
50|$|The white opaque surface makes <b>tin</b> <b>glaze</b> a good {{base for}} painted {{decoration}}. The decoration is applied as metallic oxides, most commonly cobalt oxide for blue, copper oxide for green, iron oxide for brown, manganese dioxide for purple-brown and antimony for yellow. Late Italian maiolica blended oxides to produce detailed and realistic polychrome paintings, called istoriato. To these oxides modern potters {{are able to}} add powdered ceramic colours made from combinations of oxide, sometimes fritted. In the sixteenth century, the use of subtle and blended colours which were {{not strong enough to}} penetrate the opaque glaze made the delicate control of ton-value possible, and the painting therefore had to be done on the glaze surface, which then becomes a common manner of painting on tin-glazed wares.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tin</b> <b>glazing</b> {{creates a}} {{brilliant}} white, opaque surface for painting. The colours are applied as metallic oxides or as fritted underglazes to the unfired glaze, which absorbs pigment like fresco, making errors impossible to fix, but preserving the brilliant colors. Sometimes {{the surface is}} covered with a second glaze (called coperta by the Italians) that lends greater shine and brilliance to the wares. In the case of lustred wares, a further firing at a lower temperature is required. Kilns required wood as well as suitable clay.

The Chinese workmanship and attention to detail impressed many. Only the richest could afford the early imports. Dutch potters did not immediately imitate Chinese porcelain; they began to do so {{after the death of}} the Wanli Emperor in 1620, when the supply to Europe was interrupted. [...] "Potters now saw an opportunity to produce a cheap alternative for Chinese porcelain. After much experimenting they managed to make a thin type of earthenware which was covered with a white <b>tin</b> <b>glaze.</b> Although made of low-fired earthenware, it resembled porcelain amazingly well." [...] Delftware inspired by Chinese originals persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns. Around 1700 several factories were using enamel colours and gilding over the tin-glaze, requiring a third kiln firing at a lower temperature. Later, after Japanese Imari ware had become popular in the late 1600s and early 1700s (when it too tried to fill the gap of the Chinese shortage), Delft began making their own 'Imari ware' copying the classic 'flower vase on a terrace surrounded by three panels with cranes and pine design'. Orient-inspired Delftware remained popular into the early 1700s but then declined when Chinese porcelain became available again.|$|E
5000|$|Saddened by this decline, Swift was {{determined}} to revive this ancient craft and realize his idealistic dream; {{to prove that the}} traditional craft-based form of socio-economic production, that had existed throughout Europe until the Industrial revolution, could be successful in the modern world. The artist eventually wanted an arts & crafts centre where traditional craftspeople could ply their trade and sell their goods. He was soon joined by Portuguese artist Lima de Freitas who shared his views and helped him found the pottery. Swift in his book on Lisbon: [...] "My reason for meeting Lima on this occasion was not to talk about art. It was something much stranger stemming from our basically sympathetic view points, we had embarked on a scheme so foolhardy that, looking back on it, I do not know how we had the temerity to start. This was nothing less than to try and resuscitate the local pottery industry in our part of Algarve." [...] Having contacted local potters, the artists discovered that the craftsmen could still produce a great variety of forms that had been passed down to them by their ancestors. These pieces conformed exactly to those they had previously seen in museums, possessing the simple strength of ancient pots relating to the oldest Iberian civilizations.To realize the venture in practical terms the two artists first approached the master potter, Mestre Gregório Rodrigues, who agreed to work with them (his son, Mestre Fernando Rodrigues, worked alongside him at PorchesPottery). Swift purchased common oxides from the local hardware store, constructed a wood burning kiln and proceeded to decorate Gregório's pots. The initial results were discouraging, but undeterred, they sought professional technical advice from ceramists in Lisbon, acquired an efficient kiln and soon the first distinctive pieces of Porches Pottery began to emerge. Their workshop was a small 17th-century farmhouse — today a ceramics workshop called Olaria Pequena — just at the EN125 entrance to Porches. The pottery was soon relocated to a larger building, designed by Swift, a little further down the EN125 on the western outskirts of Porches, where it stands today. They trained local people in the mastered control of the brush, painting freely and directly onto <b>tin</b> <b>glaze</b> in the traditional majolica technique, with the girls displaying a natural ability. Very soon residents and visitors alike showed great interest in the pottery and, what began as an experiment to revive a dying craft, quickly turned into the successful venture that it is today.|$|E

The Magi greeting the Child can separately be found on {{the upper part of the}} stove (only a single tile has been preserved and a fragment of another one), together with Maria sitting with the Child (fragment). The tiles of Apostle St Mathias and a royal figure could be found above them. The characteristic technical novelty of the stove was the use of white <b>tin</b> <b>glaze</b> and also blue <b>tin</b> <b>glaze</b> on certain tiles, while the <b>tin</b> <b>glaze</b> was yellow and green on the rest of the tiles.

5000|$|In the {{beginning}} of the use of tin oxide, it is mainly viewed as a slip layer between the glaze and ceramic body.

[...] The microanalysis of later <b>tin</b> <b>glazes</b> reveals the distribution of tin oxide through the glazes rather than just at the interface, which indicates that tin oxide is really acting as an opacifier instead of only a surface coating layer.|$|R

Evidence from Muslim manuscripts, such as Akhbar al-Sin wa al-Hind (circa 851) and Ibn Kurdadhbih’s Book of Roads and Provinces (846-885), suggest that trade with China was firmly established. Lane also referred to the passage in a work written by Muhammad ibn al-Husayn al-Baihaki, (circa 1059) where he stated that the governor of Khurasan, ‘Ali ibn ‘Isa, sent as a present to the Caliph Harun al-Rashid (786-809), “twenty pieces of Chinese Imperial porcelain (Chini faghfuri), [...] the like of which had never been seen at a Caliph’s court before, in addition to 2,000 other pieces of porcelain”.|$|R
50|$|An archaeological {{excavation}} {{carried out}} in 1960 {{in the basement of}} the ruined rectangular building recovered a number of small glazed terracotta floor tiles.

They are decorated in a Hispano-Moresque style which is more usually associated with dishes and jugs. Many have a plain coloured glaze, either green, yellow or occasionally black but some have designs in brown or green on a white <b>tin</b> <b>glazed</b> background. The tiles are similar to those discovered in 1963 on the floor of Pope Benedict XII's studium in the Palais des Papes. The room was built between 1334 and 1342 and is therefore a little later. The Châteuneuf tiles are slightly larger and often have animal designs. They were almost certainly manufactured in Saint-Quentin-la-Poterie.

Both coloured <b>tin</b> <b>glaze</b> and coloured engobe covered with a transparent lead glaze were thought to have been applied on the ceramics. Around 140 objects of blue-glazed Hutterite and Haban museum objects and archaeological artefacts were analysed using a handheld XRF spectrometer.

According to the XRF measurements the blue glaze of all except one of the studied Hutterite and Haban ceramics contains tin in variable amounts (from about 0. 015 wt% up to 13 wt%). The EMPA technique showed that tin in the form of tin oxide opacifier was deliberately added to the single-layered alkali– lead or lead–alkali glaze. These data confirm that the <b>tin</b> <b>glaze</b> technique was used during production of blue-glazed ceramics, and in this respect they can be regarded as faience.

40|$|Abstract: Islamic and Hispano-Moresque glazes {{from the}} 10 th to 15 th centuries found in various archaeological sites, {{most of them}} workshops, are studied to show the {{technical}} evolution of the medieval glazing process. The technology seems to show a simplification: the early Islamic glazes were applied on prefired bodies and after fritting a lead-silica mixture, whereas for the later Islamic productions the raw materials for the lead glazes were not fritted and they were applied over unfired bodies. The same simplified technology {{was used in the}} Hispano-Moresque workshops. In the Islamic workshops lead glazes were coloured by adding elements (Fe, Cu, Mn), whereas the mfidejar technology simplified the process by using only one recipe to produce pots ofdifferent colour. This was achieved by applying the glaze in a different manner (on one side of the pot to obtain yellow or on both sides to btain green), or using different pastes (already used to produce pottery for different uses). Finally, there are differences between Islamic and Hispano-Moresque <b>tin</b> <b>glazes</b> related to the crystal size of the opacifier (tin oxide crystals), which should indicate some technological differences in temperature, glaze composition and the process to obtain the frits because of the high dependence b tween viscosity, temperature and crystal nucleatio...|$|R
