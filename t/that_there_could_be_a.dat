25|$|Although {{this is now}} thought {{unlikely}} in {{the near}} future, {{it has also been}} suggested <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> shutdown of thermohaline circulation, similar to that which is believed to have driven the Younger Dryas, an abrupt climate change event. There is also potentially a possibility of a more general disruption of ocean circulation, which may lead to an ocean anoxic event, although these are believed to be much more common in the distant past. It is unclear whether the appropriate pre-conditions for such an event exist today.|$|E
25|$|Intuitively {{it seems}} {{unlikely}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> retraction of D n onto S n − 1, {{and in the case}} n = 1 it is obviously impossible because S 0 (i.e., the endpoints of the closed interval D 1) is not even connected. The case n = 2 is less obvious, but can be proven by using basic arguments involving the fundamental groups of the respective spaces: the retraction would induce an injective group homomorphism from the fundamental group of S 1 to that of D 2, but the first group is isomorphic to Z while the latter group is trivial, so this is impossible. The case n = 2 can also be proven by contradiction based on a theorem about non-vanishing vector fields.|$|E
25|$|A Waterloo and Whitehall Railway was {{promoted}} in 1864, {{to construct a}} tube railway from Great Scotland Yard to Waterloo. It was to use air pressure to propel the vehicles northwards, and was to exhaust air to draw them southwards, using a pressure differential of 2½ oz per sq in (about 11 mbar). The trains themselves would be the pistons. The company capital was to be £100,000. It was suggested <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> branch to where the Embankment station is now located: {{it is not clear}} how a junction would be managed in a pneumatic railway. There were to be three vehicles, one loading at each terminal and one in motion in the tube, so they must have been intended to pass at the terminals. There were to be three classes of accommodation in the coaches.|$|E

She was an advocate of Croatian and Slovenian independence.

They were told not to act as news cameramen. They {{were not allowed to}} film in the street. They could only film at school or at home, in secure environments." [...] Winter added, [...] "they are not paid news cameramen, and that was not the point of the film. Would they normally be running down the street toward a firefight to film it? No. Would they run toward a bombing, knowing <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> secondary explosion or a group of soldiers, who could start, at any second, firing wildly into the crowd, to film a piece of video? No. That's not real life for any Iraqi civilian." [...] Nevertheless, Hayder sometimes filmed outside at night, and explained to the camera that he had to be careful because people are robbed if they are seen carrying even a mobile phone. On New Year's Eve, he and his friend celebrate with a bonfire in his friend's back yard, but after debating whether a noise they hear is fireworks or gunfire, Hayder rushes home. Another boy is driven to school one morning, and reach a special forces roadside checkpoint along the way. He explains, [...] "if they see me with a camera they will take me to prison; they'll think I'm a terrorist who wants to bomb them." ...|$|E

Hints by Cowell and the {{surrounding}} media that a fourth full-time judge mentoring a fourth category of contestants might be added proved to be false.

Cowell had also stated <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> 14–24s category but during the audition process the category was named as 16–24s, {{as in the previous}} two series.

2500|$|Rabbi Yaakov Ariel, {{the chief}} rabbi of Ramat Gan, criticized these minyanim in Hazofe, arguing {{that they do}} not conform to Jewish law or to Orthodox ideals of prayer, in which men and women must be kept {{separate}} at all times.

He argued that because this sexual distraction is part of human nature, waiving it is out of the question. He also wrote <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> problem of kol isha (hearing a woman's singing voice).
