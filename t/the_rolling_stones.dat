5|$|Life is {{a memoir}} {{covering}} Keith Richards's life, starting with {{his childhood in}} Dartford, Kent, through to his success with <b>the</b> <b>Rolling</b> <b>Stones</b> and his current life in Connecticut.

In his teens he met up with Mick Jagger, who he had known in primary school, and discovered that they both shared a love of blues music.

6000|$|The globe-trotter {{lives in}} a smaller world than the peasant. He is always breathing, an air of locality. London is a place, to be {{compared}} to Chicago; Chicago is a place, to be compared to Timbuctoo. But Timbuctoo is not a place, since there, at least, live men who regard it as the universe, and breathe, not an air of locality, but the winds of the world. The man in the saloon steamer has seen all the races of men, and he is thinking {{of the things that}} divide men--diet, dress, decorum, rings in the nose as in Africa, or in the ears as in Europe, blue paint among the ancients, or red paint among the modern Britons. The man in the cabbage field has seen nothing at all; but he is thinking of the things that unite men--hunger and babies, and the beauty of women, and the promise or menace of the sky. Mr. Kipling, with all his merits, is the globe-trotter; he has not the patience to become part of anything. So great and genuine a man is not to be accused of a merely cynical cosmopolitanism; still, his cosmopolitanism is his weakness. That weakness is splendidly expressed in one of his finest poems, [...] "The Sestina of the Tramp Royal," [...] in which a man declares that he can endure anything in the way of hunger or horror, but not permanent presence in one place. In this there is certainly danger. The more dead and dry and dusty a thing is the more it travels about; dust is like this and the thistle-down and the High Commissioner in South Africa. Fertile things are somewhat heavier, like the heavy fruit trees on the pregnant mud of the Nile. In the heated idleness of youth we were all rather inclined to quarrel with the implication of that proverb which says that a <b>rolling</b> <b>stone</b> gathers no moss. We were inclined to ask, [...] "Who wants to gather moss, except silly old ladies?" [...] But for all that we begin to perceive that the proverb is right. <b>The</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stone</b> rolls echoing from rock to rock; but <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stone</b> is dead. <b>The</b> moss is silent because the moss is alive.|$|R
60|$|Now his {{greatest}} virtue lay in this: {{he had not}} become hardened in the mould baked by his several forbears and into {{which he had been}} pressed by his mother's hands. Some atavism had been at work in the making of him, and he had reverted to that ancestor who sturdily uplifted. But so far this portion of his heritage had lain dormant. He had simply remained adjusted to a stable environment. There had been no call upon the adaptability which was his. But whensoever the call came, being so constituted, it was manifest that he should adapt, should adjust himself to the unwonted pressure of new conditions. The maxim of <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stone</b> may be all true; but notwithstanding, in the scheme of life, the inability to become fixed is an excellence par excellence. Though he did not know it, this inability was Vance Corliss's most splendid possession.|$|R
