The technique exploits the fluctuation dissipation theorem, which relates the relaxation of <b>thermal</b> <b>excitations</b> of a probe particle to the viscoelastic properties of the surrounding medium. The relaxation of the <b>thermal</b> <b>excitations</b> of probe particles are determined by measuring the time evolution of the mean square displacement using dynamic light scattering. A Langevin equation with a time-dependent damping term is used to relate this mean square displacement to the dynamic shear modulus of the medium.

The damping rate increases with increasing lattice depth, which is consistent with experimental observations. The magnitude of the damping rate is in reasonable agreement with experimental data.

50|$|Most {{consumer}} inkjet printers, {{including those}} from Canon (FINE), Hewlett-Packard, and Lexmark, use the thermal inkjet process.

Vaught's work started in late 1978 with a project to develop fast, low-cost printing. The team at HP found that thin-film resistors could produce enough heat to fire an ink droplet.

40|$|We {{extend our}} {{previous}} {{study of the}} quark-hadron phase transition at finite temperatures with zero net baryon density by two flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with Polyakov loop to the three flavor case in a scheme which incorporates flavor nonet pseudo scalar and scalar mesonic correlations on equal footing. The role of the axial U(1) breaking Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft interaction on the low-lying <b>thermal</b> <b>excitations</b> is examined. At low temperatures, only mesonic correlations, mainly due to low mass mesonic collective excitations, pions and kaons, dominate the pressure while <b>thermal</b> <b>excitations</b> of quarks are suppressed by the Polyakov loop. As temperature increases, kaons and pions melt into the continuum of quark and anti-quark excitations successively so that hadronic phase changes continuously to the quark phase where quark excitations dominate pressure together with gluon pressure coming from the effective potential for the Polyakov loop. Since we introduce mesons as not elementary fields but auxiliary fields made from quarks, we can describe the phase transition between hadronic phase and quark phase in a unified fashion.

40|$|The {{electronic}} scattering {{rates in}} metals after ultrashort pulsed laser heating can be drastically different than those predicted from free electron theory. The large electron temperature achieved after ultrashort pulsed absorption and subsequent thermalization {{can lead to}} excitation of subconduction band <b>thermal</b> <b>excitations</b> of electron orbitals far below the Fermi energy. In the case of noble metals, which all have a characteristic flat d-band several electron volts well below the Fermi energy, the onset of d-band excitations {{has been shown to}} increase electron-phonon scattering rates by an order of magnitude. In this paper, we investigate the effects of these large electronic <b>thermal</b> <b>excitations</b> on the ultrafast thermoelectric transport properties of gold, a characteristic noble metal. Under conditions of strong electron-phonon nonequilibrium (relatively high electron temperatures and relatively low lattice temperatures, T_{e} >> T_{L}), we find that the Wiedemann–Franz law breaks down and the Seebeck coefficient is massively enhanced. Although we perform representative calculations for Au, these results are expected to be similar for the other noble metals (Ag and Cu) due to the characteristic large d-band separation from the Fermi energy...|$|R
50|$|At higher temperatures, however, {{nitrogen}} gas gains one more degree of internal freedom, as the molecule is excited into higher vibrational modes that store thermal energy. A vibrational {{degree of freedom}} contributes a heat capacity of 1/2 R each for kinetic and potential energy, {{for a total of}} R. Now the bond is contributing heat capacity, and (because of storage of energy in potential energy) is contributing more than if the atoms were not bonded. With full <b>thermal</b> <b>excitation</b> of bond vibration, the heat capacity per volume, or per mole of gas molecules approaches seven-thirds that of monatomic gases. Significantly, this is seven-sixths of the monatomic gas value on a mole-of-atoms basis, so this is now a higher heat capacity per atom than the monatomic figure, because the vibrational mode enables for diatomic gases allows an extra degree of potential energy freedom per pair of atoms, which monatomic gases cannot possess. See thermodynamic temperature for more information on translational motions, kinetic (heat) energy, and their relationship to temperature.|$|E
50|$|Electron {{excitation}} is {{the transfer}} of a bound electron to a more energetic, but still bound state. This {{can be done by}} photoexcitation (PE), where the electron absorbs a photon and gains all its energy or by electrical excitation (EE), where the electron receives energy from another, energetic electron. Within a semiconductor crystal lattice, <b>thermal</b> <b>excitation</b> is a process where lattice vibrations provide enough energy to transfer electrons to a higher energy band. When an excited electron falls back to a state of lower energy, it undergoes electron relaxation. This is accompanied by the emission of a photon (radiative relaxation) or by a transfer of energy to another particle. The energy released is equal to the difference in energy levels between the electron energy states.But, because Noble gas atoms have a relatively high first ionization energy and the electrons don't carry enough energy to cause excitation therefore ionization and excitation of the atoms are unlikely and the probability of elastic scattering over all angles is approximately equal to the probability of collision. Ramseur and Townsend effect is somehow familiar in this case.|$|E
5000|$|Peierls' theorem {{states that}} a {{one-dimensional}} equally spaced chain with one electron per ion is unstable. It was asserted in the 1930s by Rudolf Peierls. It can be proven using a simple {{model of the}} potential for an electron in a 1-D crystal with lattice spacing [...] The periodicity of the crystal creates energy band gaps in the [...] diagram {{at the edge of the}} Brillouin zone [...] (similar to the result of the Kronig-Penney model, which helps to explain the origin of band gaps in semiconductors). If the ions each contribute one electron, then the band will be half-filled, up to values of [...] in the ground state.Imagine a lattice distortion where every other ion moves closer to one neighbor and further away from the other, the unfavourable energy of the long bond between ions is outweighed by the energy gain of the short bond. The period has just doubled from [...] to [...] In essence, the proof relies on the fact that doubling the period would introduce new band gaps located at multiples of see the figure in the right. This would cause small energy savings, based on the distortion of the bands in the vicinity of the new gaps. Approaching , the distortion due to the introduction of the new band gap will cause the electrons to be at a lower energy than they would be in the perfect crystal. Therefore, this lattice distortion becomes energetically favorable when the energy savings due to the new band gaps outweighs the elastic energy cost of rearranging the ions. Of course, this effect will be noticeable only when the electrons are arranged close to their ground state - in other words, <b>thermal</b> <b>excitation</b> should be minimized. Therefore, the Peierls transition should be seen at low temperature. This is the basic argument for the occurrence of the Peierls transition, sometimes called dimerization.|$|E
