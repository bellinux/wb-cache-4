5|$|Chief Justice Yong, {{referring}} to <b>the</b> <b>affidavit</b> of the Minister for Culture, held that Order 123 was made after the Government had been {{satisfied that the}} teachings and beliefs contained in publications of the WTBTS were contrary to the public interest. The Minister had viewed the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses as being prejudicial to the Government's nation-building efforts, and hence he had rightly exercised his discretion to prohibit such publications.|$|E
5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition in an appropriate case. The Court found that on <b>the</b> <b>affidavit</b> evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E

25|$|Richard Ceballos {{had been}} {{employed}} since 1989 as a {{deputy district attorney}} for the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office, {{which at the time}} was headed by Gil Garcetti. After the defense attorney in a pending criminal case contacted Ceballos about his motion to challenge a critical search warrant based on inaccuracies in the supporting affidavit, Ceballos conducted his own investigation and determined that <b>the</b> <b>affidavit</b> contained serious misrepresentations. Ceballos contacted the deputy sheriff who had sworn out <b>the</b> <b>affidavit</b> but was not satisfied by his explanations. Ceballos then communicated his findings to his supervisors and submitted a memorandum in which he recommended dismissal of the case. A meeting was subsequently held to discuss <b>the</b> <b>affidavit</b> with his superiors and officials from the sheriff's department, which Ceballos claimed became heated and accusatory of his role in handling the case. Despite Ceballos’ concerns, his supervisor decided to proceed with the prosecution. The criminal trial court held a hearing on the motion, during which Ceballos was called by the defense to recount his observations about <b>the</b> <b>affidavit.</b> The trial court nevertheless denied the motion and upheld the warrant.|$|E

[...] Melendez-Diaz objected to their admission asserting that the Supreme Court decision in Crawford v. Washington required the forensic analyst to testify in person.

50|$|After being {{convicted and}} sentenced to prison, John Brewer was visited several times by Byrd's {{attorney}} at the time. One such visit, on May 16, 1989, nearly six years after his conviction, resulted in Brewer's executing an <b>affidavit.</b> <b>The</b> Ohio Public Defender's Office, which represented Byrd during his appeals, withheld <b>the</b> <b>affidavits</b> through much of the appellate process gambling that Byrd would eventually win a retrial. <b>The</b> <b>affidavits</b> from Brewer clearly place Byrd {{at the scene of the}} crime, a difficult fact to overcome in trial.|$|R
25|$|Harris {{had noted}} on his site {{that he had}} made pipe bombs, in {{addition}} to a hit list of individuals (he did not post any plan on how he intended to attack targets). As Harris had posted on his website that he possessed explosives, Guerra wrote a draft affidavit, requesting a search warrant of the Harris household. <b>The</b> <b>affidavit</b> also mentioned a suspicion of Harris being involved in an unsolved pipe bomb case in February 1998. <b>The</b> <b>affidavit</b> was never filed. It was concealed by the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office and not revealed until September 2001, resulting from an investigation by the TV show 60 Minutes.|$|E

50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>affidavits</b> filed {{were not}} lengthy, {{contained}} {{all the necessary}} averments and defined the issues with sufficient clarity, {{the court held that}} it would be pointless to order pleadings to be filed. Accordingly, and to save time and further expense, and as the particular circumstances of the case dictated such a course, it was found to be more appropriate to order that <b>the</b> <b>affidavits</b> stand as pleadings which were closed. The court ordered accordingly.|$|R

25|$|After {{the revelation}} about <b>the</b> <b>affidavit,</b> {{a series of}} grand jury {{investigations}} were begun into the cover-up activities of Jefferson County officials. The investigation revealed that high-ranking county officials had met {{a few days after}} the massacre to discuss the release of <b>the</b> <b>affidavit</b> to the public. It was decided that because the affidavit's contents lacked the necessary probable cause to have supported the issuance of a search warrant for the Harris household by a judge, it would be best not to disclose the affidavit's existence at an upcoming press conference, although the actual conversations and points of discussion were never revealed to anyone other than the grand jury members. Following the press conference, the original Guerra documents disappeared. In September 1999, a Jefferson County investigator failed to find the documents during a secret search of the county's computer system. A second attempt in late 2000 found copies of the document within the Jefferson County archives. The documents were reconstructed and released to the public in September 2001, but the original documents are still missing. The final grand jury investigation was released in September 2004.|$|E
