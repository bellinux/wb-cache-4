A central figure in Chinese culture, Laozi is claimed by both the emperors of the Tang dynasty and modern people of the Li surname as a founder of their lineage.

5|$|Although Maitreyi {{of ancient}} India, {{described}} as an Advaita philosopher, {{is said to be}} a wife of the sage Yajnavalkya in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad in the time of Janaka, the Hindu epic Mahabharata states Sulabha Maitreyi is a young beauty who never marries. In the latter, Maitreyi explains Advaita philosophy (monism) to Janaka and is described as a lifelong ascetic. She is called as a brahmavadini (a female expounder of the Veda) in ancient Sanskrit literature. Maitreyi and Yajnavalkya are estimated <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> around the 8th century BCE.|$|E
5|$|Although not well-studied, {{there is}} growing {{acceptance}} of three species of Malagasy hippopotamus. It is not known when or exactly how these hippos arrived {{on the island of}} Madagascar. As hippos are semi-aquatic, it is possible that they survived the 400km (248mi) trek across the channel, although presumably when the water was shallower and there were perhaps small islands along the way. It is possible that the three species of hippopotamus represent three distinct and successful colonizations of the island. Hippos are the only endemic ungulates ever <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> on Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|Edmontosaurus {{was widely}} {{distributed}} across western North America. The distribution of Edmontosaurus fossils {{suggests that it}} preferred coasts and coastal plains. It was a herbivore that could move on both two legs and four. Because it is known from several bone beds, Edmontosaurus is thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> in groups, {{and may have been}} migratory as well. The wealth of fossils has allowed researchers to study its paleobiology in detail, including its brain, how it may have fed, and its injuries and pathologies, such as evidence for tyrannosaur attacks on a few edmontosaur specimens.|$|E
5|$|If Hahn's {{account is}} disregarded, the Mascarene parrot {{probably}} became extinct prior to 1800. The last account of wild specimens on Réunion {{is from the}} 1770s. It is thought that the Mascarene parrot went extinct in the wild while captive specimens still survived in Europe, since specimens are known <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> there after the last mention of wild birds. In the 1790s, French author, explorer, and naturalist François Levaillant stated that the bird was rare {{and that he had}} seen three specimens in France.|$|E

5|$|Quaggas {{were said}} to be lively and highly strung, {{especially}} the stallions. During the 1830s, quaggas were used as harness animals for carriages in London, the males probably being gelded to mitigate their volatile nature. Local farmers used them as guards for their livestock, as they were likely to attack intruders. On the other hand, captive quaggas in European zoos {{were said to}} be tamer and more docile than Burchell's zebra. One specimen was reported <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> in captivity for 21 years and 4 months, dying in 1872.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{proboscideans}} lived on islands and experienced insular dwarfism. This occurred primarily during the Pleistocene when some elephant populations became isolated by fluctuating sea levels, although dwarf elephants did exist {{earlier in the}} Pliocene. These elephants likely grew smaller on islands {{due to a lack}} of large or viable predator populations and limited resources. By contrast, small mammals such as rodents develop gigantism in these conditions. Dwarf proboscideans are known <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> in Indonesia, the Channel Islands of California, and several islands of the Mediterranean.|$|E
