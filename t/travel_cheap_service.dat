50|$|If {{the demand}} for energy {{services}} remains constant, improving energy efficiency will reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. However, many efficiency improvements do not reduce energy consumption by the amount predicted by simple engineering models. This is because they make energy <b>services</b> <b>cheaper,</b> and so consumption of those services increases. For example, since fuel efficient vehicles make <b>travel</b> <b>cheaper,</b> consumers may choose to drive farther, thereby offsetting some of the potential energy savings. Similarly, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that energy efficiency improvements were almost always outpaced by economic growth, resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution. These are examples of the direct rebound effect.|$|R
50|$|The {{supporters}} of privatization in Israel claim that reducing the state's involvement increases {{the involvement of}} individuals. Thus, promoting competition, encouraging investment, having a strong economy and reducing the state expenses—which would lead to <b>cheaper</b> <b>services.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 2006, {{competition}} for {{long distance traffic}} was introduced by Megabus, {{a subsidiary of the}} large UK bus operating company Stagecoach. This company operates <b>cheap</b> <b>services</b> aimed at students and the like, which must be booked in advance on the internet.|$|R
50|$|However, {{there are}} many {{unregistered}} installers who do not carry these overheads, and who typically offer <b>cheaper</b> <b>service.</b> Consequently, ARGI views the RGIs increasing overheads as increasing the price differential and therefore a boost to the unregistered installer with whom they must compete.|$|R
50|$|In April 2006, Telecom New Zealand {{introduced}} new <b>cheaper</b> <b>services</b> with download {{speeds up}} to 3.5 Mbit/s, some thought this was to avoid regulatory local loop unbundling. In May 2006 local loop unbundling was announced {{as part of a}} comprehensive telecommunications package.|$|R
50|$|The {{strategy}} of the Banja Luka Stock Exchange is to further improve quality and create <b>cheaper</b> <b>services</b> for its Members {{and to provide a}} transparent and fair trading environment for domestic and foreign issuers and investors. The BLSE will continue working at achieving the standard of services comparable with those prevailing on developed capital markets.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence on}} the nature of competition in the post-deregulation U. S. air travel market. It begins with an historical review of the U. S. market since deregulation. An econometric study of domestic air fares for 1995 and 2000 is used to address the following questions: How does the level of competition on a particular route or in a particular airport affect fares Does competition from low-cost airlines have an especially large effect on fares Do hub-and-spoke systems make air <b>travel</b> <b>cheaper</b> for the consumer...|$|R

Unable to afford surgery at the hospital, Marge and Homer see a {{commercial}} for Dr. Nick Riviera, an incompetent surgeon who will perform any operation for $129.95. Leaving no other alternative, Homer decides {{to go for the}} <b>cheaper</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R
5000|$|His {{daughter}} dated U.S. {{military personnel}} and opened a beauty parlor that offered the best and <b>cheapest</b> <b>services</b> in the city. Wives of high-ranking military personnel would spend hours gossiping about the coming and going of their husbands and boyfriends. [...] "They talked so much," [...] she would later say, [...] "that {{it was a relief}} when they left the place".|$|R
50|$|Benapole land port is also lucrative for Indian {{exporters}} for its <b>cheaper</b> <b>service</b> {{and equipment}} charges. Indian goods receive duty exemption advantage {{in this land}} port. The Indian Government has also decided to give priority to export in Bangladesh through Benapole-Petrapole border. Kolkata, one of the commercial hubs of India, is only 80 kilometers away from the Petrapole-Benapole border and is involved in development in the area.|$|R
50|$|Salminen {{suffered}} {{from a lack of}} funds in his later years. His apartment in Espoo burned down in 2005, the fire having started from a candle. After the fire, Salminen moved to a service home with the help of MTV3 who paid for his first three years there. Later, Salminen moved to Salo to a <b>cheaper</b> <b>service</b> home where he resided until the end of his life.|$|R

The authors offer a proposal to improve the balancing market system, with a view to achieving a more flexible, transparent, and competitive structure, which in turn should lead to more efficient and <b>cheaper</b> <b>service,</b> without compromising the bedrock need to maintain system security. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
50|$|In 2008, MTS started {{offering}} Internet {{service to}} mobile subscribers via GPRS. Altyn Asyr {{was first to}} launch 3G and 2 mpbs mobile internet service in March 2010. Move surprised mobile customers as the provider was known for inferior but <b>cheaper</b> <b>service.</b> In 2013 Altyn Asyr launched a 4G network based on LTE. In 2013, unlimited {{use of the internet}} became available, reducing the total cost of services from Turkmentelecom.|$|R
50|$|Between 2006 and 2014, American {{intercity}} buses {{focused on}} medium-haul trips between 200 and 300 miles; airplanes performed {{the bulk of}} longer trips and automobiles shorter ones. For most medium-haul trips curbside bus fares were less {{than the cost of}} automobile gasoline, and one tenth that of Amtrak. Buses are also four times more fuel-efficient than automobiles. Their Wi-Fi service is also popular; one study estimated that 92% of Megabus and BoltBus passengers planned to use an electronic device. New lower fares introduced by Greyhound on traditional medium-distance routes and rising gasoline prices have increased ridership across the network and made bus <b>travel</b> <b>cheaper</b> than all alternatives.|$|R
30|$|Sharing {{economy has}} led to several issues about {{inequality}} as well. One issue is labor and capital and their relationship with income inequality. Those with capital (i.e., the relatively well-off) stand to gain a lot while those with only labor to sell/share stand to gain little [51]. Additionally, access to sharing economy can be limited, particularly for poorer people without smartphones, who thus lack access to <b>cheaper</b> <b>services</b> that the better-off can use [36].|$|R
5000|$|Airtel {{provides}} both post-paid and pre-paid connection plans. Its prepaid {{features the}} remarkable Ajibon 1 Paisa offer. Airtel Postpaid and Airtel Prepaid users enjoy various {{value added services}} (VAS), such as SMS, MMS, GPRS, [...] "Smart SIM", International Roaming, Corporate packages for product advertising via SMS etc. Despite offering the <b>cheapest</b> <b>services,</b> Airtel cannot properly resolve customers' complaints about its network quality. Airtel is often blamed by its subscribers for the unclear voice quality on its 2G network.|$|R

5000|$|Kepnes' first book, How to Travel the World on $50 a Day: <b>Travel</b> <b>Cheaper,</b> Longer, Smarter, was {{published}} in 2013 by Penguin. Writers from the New York Times, National Geographic, and Outside Television blurbed the book. Matt Gross of the New York Times said, [...] "“Whether you’re a savvy backpacker or just dreaming of getting a passport and going overseas, Matt’s collection of easy-to-employ money-saving strategies will open your eyes to the near-infinite ways of seeing the world without busting your budget.” The book outlines Kepnes' belief that travel can be inexpensive while still being extensive. It offers tips for getting free sky miles, avoiding overseas bank fees, and finding cheap accommodations.|$|R
50|$|Collaborating in CUSOs allows {{credit unions}} to {{capitalize}} on these outcomes and provide good member services. It gives the ability to provide better <b>service,</b> <b>cheaper</b> <b>service</b> and new services that credit unions {{may not be able}} to provide. For example, not all credit unions have the capital to gain the expertise to originate business loans. But, if several credit unions pool their resources they can afford to hire the right individuals and in turn provide a valuable service to their members.|$|R
50|$|Short sea {{shipping}} is, as of today, {{the most}} ecological {{means of transportation}} and offering <b>cheaper</b> <b>services</b> than other means. As a leading short sea shipping in Europe and serving the SECA areas of the North sea and Baltic Sea, EML has committed to reduce its emissions (SOx, NOx…) in order to limit the impact of its activity on climate change. In order to reach this objective, EML is using an ultra low sulfur fuel and {{is part of the}} Trident Alliance.|$|R
50|$|In {{developing}} {{parts of}} the world, traditional bonesetters are widely popular and often the only access to treatment {{for these kinds of}} injuries. Most often it will be the case that {{there is a shortage of}} orthopedic doctors and surgeons in the country and so the two practitioners coexist in the same setting. In parts of South America, Asia and Africa, traditional bonesetters treat musculoskeletal injuries in general, not just fractures and dislocations. Traditional bonesetters are also known to offer <b>cheaper</b> <b>services</b> and allegedly faster treatment options.|$|R
40|$|We model a ferry {{market where}} {{passengers}} are heterogeneous in their valuation of waiting time and, unlike in previous studies, can take services from all operators. Analyzing their behavior when two operators are active, each providing one service, {{we find that}} complex patterns of product differentiation emerge between two goods that (i) do not exactly correspond to the available services and (ii) display service frequencies as quality attributes. A (low-quality) basic good, coinciding with the <b>cheaper</b> <b>service,</b> attracts low-time-value passengers. A (high-quality) composite good, which is a bundle of the two available services, appeals to high-time-value passengers. Consequently, demand is positive for either operator so that an inefficient operator is not crowded out. In the specific case of a mixed duopoly, a price-aggressive public operator spans discipline over (but does not monopolize) the whole market; a soft one boosts "quality" (i. e., frequency) vis-à-vis fraction of the population only, that is yet larger than under classical vertical differentiation. Policy-makers pursuing redistribution objectives should target the <b>cheaper</b> <b>service,</b> in general, privileging either a raise in its frequency (when it is low) or a cut in its price (when frequency is high), depending upon the group of passengers they wish to support...|$|R
25|$|Wildlife {{conservation}} {{scientists have}} started to recommend and use introduced populations of feral domestic water buffalo in far-away lands to manage uncontrolled vegetation growth in and around natural wetlands. Introduced water buffalo at home in such environs provide <b>cheap</b> <b>service</b> by regularly grazing the uncontrolled vegetation and opening up clogged water bodies for waterfowl, wetland birds, and other wildlife. Grazing water buffalo are sometimes used in Great Britain for conservation grazing, such as in Chippenham Fen National Nature Reserve. The buffalo can better adapt to wet conditions and poor-quality vegetation than cattle.|$|R
50|$|Independent escorts {{may have}} differing fees {{depending}} on the season, or whether the client is a regular or semi-regular customer. Independent escorts may tend to see clients for extended meetings involving dinner or social activities whereas agency escorts tend to be split into two categories: <b>Cheaper</b> <b>services,</b> especially if mainly based around incall appointments (client visiting the escort at her accommodation), often only provide sexual services, while agencies that provide mainly outcall appointments (the escort visiting the client at either their home or hotel) tend to offer services {{similar to that of}} independent escorts.|$|R
50|$|Of {{particular}} interest to international tourists interested in public access shooting ranges in the United States while on vacation, especially gun-friendly states include Kentucky, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, New Hampshire, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, and Utah, among others. All of these states have publicly accessible shooting ranges with rental guns available at a modest fee. Ammunition costs for rental guns varies, of course, but 9×19mm Luger (usually the <b>cheapest</b> <b>service</b> caliber round) is often available for around $15 per 50 at sporting goods stores or slightly higher ($18-25) at most public access shooting ranges.|$|R
50|$|The {{modernization}} of the commuter railway system, however, {{did not begin}} until 2011. In 2011, the number of lines are greatly reduced from 37 point-to-point routes to six integrated lines (known as Loop line system), express services are removed, and the service are simplified into two service classes: economy class (<b>cheaper</b> <b>service</b> without air conditioning, subsidized by Ministry of Transportation) and Commuter class (more expensive service with air conditioning), both stops at every station. On July 25, 2013, the economy class discontinued, leaving the Commuter class as the sole service class throughout the network.|$|R

50|$|Glo-1 has the {{potential}} to provide high speed internet services, faster, more reliable and <b>cheaper</b> telecom <b>services.</b> Glo-1 will potentially facilitate foreign investment and employment opportunities especially to Africans.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of Pakistanis in Singapore {{enter the country}} as university students. More than 100 Pakistani students study in the National University of Singapore alone. In 2009, 22,300 Pakistanis visited Singapore for tourism. Pakistanis living in Johor Bahru also use Singapore for their transit route for international <b>travel,</b> because of <b>cheaper</b> <b>travel</b> cost and shorter travel time duration travelling from the Singapore Changi Airport, {{as opposed to the}} nearest major Malaysian international airport in Kuala Lumpur, the Kuala Lumpur International Airport.|$|R
