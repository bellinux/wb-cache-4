5|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female adult red-backed fairywren may utilise the {{rodent-run}} {{display to}} distract predators from nests with young birds. The head, neck and tail are lowered, the wings are held {{out and the}} feathers are fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female are {{involved}} in the nest building. The male does most of the work, while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators. The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground. The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots. The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks. Once the eggs are hatched, both <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female will feed the chicks.|$|E
5|$|Lead affects both <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female {{reproductive}} systems. In men, when {{blood lead}} levels exceed 40μg/dL, sperm count is reduced and changes occur in volume of sperm, their motility, and their morphology.|$|E

5|$|The zona incerta, grouped {{between the}} arcuate and periventricular nuclei, {{projects}} to several {{areas of the}} hypothalamus, and participates in the control of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which is necessary to activate the development of <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female reproductive systems, following puberty.|$|E
5|$|Amplexus between <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female occurs {{mainly in}} water, but {{sometimes}} at substantial distances away on dry land. Observations of breeding sites {{have shown the}} males linger around the courting area for much longer times, while females mostly stay at other places to find food before meeting the males there. During amplexus, the males grab the females near their armpits after climbing on their backs. In the wild, amplexus usually takes between 10 minutes and five days. Artificially induced amplexus in the laboratory has been observed to last 50 hours, {{but there have been}} reports of five days. Sometimes, amplexus will not result in eggs being laid.|$|E

30|$|The {{results of}} this study are {{compatible}} with results of Goyal and Goyal (2013) who found that forwardly directed rugae (48.3 % in <b>the</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 40.8 % in the females) were more common than backwardly directed rugae (17.8 % in <b>the</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 19.6 % in the females) among Rwandan populations. Additionally, non-significant differences between both sexes were noticed.|$|R

5|$|As long {{as winter}} food is available, both <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female {{will remain in}} the {{territory}} throughout the year, although occupying different areas. Migrants are more gregarious, travelling in small flocks and feeding in loose groups in the wintering grounds. The flight of migrating birds comprises bursts of rapid wing beats interspersed with level or diving movement, and differs from both the normal fast agile flight of this species and the more dipping action of larger thrushes.|$|E
5|$|Female okapis become {{sexually mature}} at about one-and-a-half years old, while males reach {{maturity}} after two years. Rut in males and estrus in females {{does not depend}} on the season. In captivity, estrus cycles recur every 15 days. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> the female begin courtship by circling, smelling and licking each other. The male shows his dominance by extending his neck, tossing his head and protruding one leg forward. This is followed by mounting and copulation.|$|E
5|$|Females are {{generally}} attracted to males by their calls, though in nonstridulatory species, some other mechanism must be involved. After the pair has made antennal contact, a courtship period may occur {{during which the}} character of the call changes. The female mounts <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> a single spermatophore is transferred to the external genitalia of the female. Sperm flows from this into the female's oviduct over a period of a few minutes or up to an hour, depending on species. After copulation, the female may remove or eat the spermatophore; males may attempt to prevent this with various ritualised behaviours. The female may mate on several occasions with different males.|$|E

5|$|Fossils of the troodonts Mei and Sinornithoides {{demonstrate}} that some dinosaurs slept {{with their heads}} tucked under their arms. This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds. Several deinonychosaur and oviraptorosaur specimens have also been found preserved {{on top of their}} nests, likely brooding in a bird-like manner. The ratio between egg volume and body mass of adults among these dinosaurs suggest that the eggs were primarily brooded by <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> <b>and</b> that the young were highly precocial, similar to many modern ground-dwelling birds.|$|E

In a survey of German football fans, 65percent of <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> 62percent of the female respondents said {{they were interested in}} women's football. However, this popularity is mostly limited to international matches. Although the number of spectators in the women's Bundesliga has more than doubled since 2003, the average attendance in the 2007–08 season (887) was still less than three percent of that of the men's Bundesliga (38,612).|$|E
40|$|Adult {{protective}} service workers (APSWs) (N= 170) were asked across Ontario {{to estimate the}} prevalence of tobacco use, alcohol/drug problems among their clients with a developmental disability (DD) and to describe one person with the most severe alcohol/drug problem. Survey results (46. 5 % return) showed that overall 24 % of <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 15 % of males smoked tobacco. Ten percent of <b>the</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 5 % of the females were identified as having alcohol/drug problems.

5|$|Like most brown algae, Postelsia {{goes through}} {{alternation}} of generations, {{and is an}} annual species. The diploid sporophyte produces, through meiosis, haploid spores, which drip down through the grooves in the blades onto the substrate, which may be mussels, barnacles, or bare rock. These spores develop, through mitosis, into small, multicellular haploid gametophytes, male and female. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female gametophytes create sperm and eggs, respectively. The sperm of the male reaches the female egg and fertilizes, resulting in a diploid zygote, which develops into a new sporophyte.|$|E
5|$|Other merozoites {{develop into}} {{immature}} gametocytes, {{which are the}} precursors {{of male and female}} gametes. When a fertilized mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are taken up with the blood and mature in the mosquito gut. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female gametocytes fuse and form an ookinete—a fertilized, motile zygote. Ookinetes develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insect's salivary glands, ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are injected into the skin, in the saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{blackcap}} (Sylvia atricapilla) usually known {{simply as}} the blackcap, is a common and widespread typical warbler. It has mainly olive-grey upperparts and pale grey underparts, and differences between the five subspecies are small. Both sexes have a neat coloured cap to the head, black in <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> reddish-brown in the female. The male's typical song is a rich musical warbling, often ending in a loud high-pitched crescendo, but a simpler song is given in some isolated areas, such as valleys in the Alps. The blackcap's closest relative is the garden warbler, which looks quite different but has a similar song.|$|E
5|$|The {{genitalia}} of <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> {{female in}} any particular species are adapted to fit each other like a lock (male) and key (female). In males, the ninth abdominal segment is divided into a dorsal 'tegumen' and ventral 'viniculum'. They form a ring-like structure for the attachment of genital parts {{and a pair of}} lateral clasping organs (claspers or 'harpe'). The male has a median tubular organ (called the aedeagus) which is extended through an eversible sheath (or 'vesica') to inseminate the female. The males have paired sperm ducts in all lepidopterans; the paired testes are separate in basal taxa and fused in advanced forms.|$|E
5|$|The {{loudness}} of {{the song}} is correlated {{with the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> the quality of the habitat, both indicators of male attractiveness. The loudest males may attract 20 females in one evening, when a quieter male may attract none. This behaviour enables acoustic trapping: females can be trapped in large numbers by broadcasting a male's song very loudly.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to evaluate dental age in 102 patients with Down Syndrome, using panoramic radiographs. A software program developed by the Discipline of Radiology, School of Dentistry of São José dos Campos, São Paulo State University (UNESP), was used. A table of mineralization chronology of permanent teeth among Brazilians conceived by Nicodemo, Moraes and Medici Filho was used within the software. Statistical analysis of the results showed that 70. 91 % of <b>the</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 61. 21 % of the females presented advanced dental age. Only 32. 09 % of <b>the</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 38. 79 % of the females presented delayed dental age. Regarding the differences between the dental and chronological ages, two thirds of <b>the</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females presented dental age with differences of up to 12 months, which means that they can be considered to be within normal standards, whereas only 18. 87 % of <b>the</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 10. 21 % of the females presented dental age outside normal standards, with differences of over 24 months. In conclusion, the majority of the patients with Down Syndrome were considered to be within the normal standards of mineralization chronology...|$|R
