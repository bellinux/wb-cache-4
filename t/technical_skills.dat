40|$|The {{literature}} on managerial effectiveness has concentrated on cataloguing the administrative and interpersonal {{skills necessary for}} good management, yet has {{paid little attention to}} <b>technical</b> <b>skill</b> as a necessary skill at the lower levels of management. To date there is no empirical evidence directly linking <b>technical</b> <b>skill</b> to managerial effectiveness. This study thus tested three hypotheses: (a) <b>technical</b> <b>skill</b> provides incremental value over administrative and interpersonal skill in managerial effectiveness; (b) <b>technical</b> <b>skill</b> is related to social power and influence tactics; and (c) group autonomy significantly moderates the relationship between <b>technical</b> <b>skill</b> and expert power. One hundred seven first-level supervisors from local petrochemical and engineering companies completed an on-line survey, where they answered questions about their professional background and managerial skills; their respective subordinates and supervisors provided information about their <b>technical</b> <b>skill,</b> managerial effectiveness, power, and influence tactics habits. The hypotheses were partially supported; <b>technical</b> <b>skill</b> provided incremental value, and was related to power and influence tactics only when measured judgmentally. Possible explanations and future directions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Artistic {{quality is}} {{often thought of}} in terms of two {{components:}} originality and <b>technical</b> <b>skill.</b> To examine the relations between these three constructs, 35 judges rated 72 drawings on 25 survey items related to quality, <b>technical</b> <b>skill,</b> and originality. Rasch statistical analysis revealed an underlying dimen-sion of quality. Items related to both <b>technical</b> <b>skill</b> and originality loaded highly onto this dimension, indicating that both are components of quality. All three measures were strongly inter-correlated. <b>Technical</b> <b>skill</b> and origin-ality jointly accounted for over 90 % {{of the variance in}} quality. Despite a high correlation (r =. 65), <b>technical</b> <b>skill</b> and originality can be distinguished in three ways: originality items fit the underlying quality dimension better than did <b>technical</b> <b>skill</b> items, originality was more difficult to achieve than technical, and the two kinds of items loaded with opposite valences on the first factor of a factor analysis...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{essential}} skills needed by project personnel to manage construction safety is <b>technical</b> <b>skill,</b> which may consist of scheduling, budgeting, quality management, document management, risk management, and procurement management skills. This research aims to investigate how <b>technical</b> <b>skill</b> may influence safety performance. Quantitative data (N= 273) were collected and analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM) technique. It was found that document management and risk management skills positively influence the implementation of safety tasks, which in turn, promotes safety climate development. Budgeting skill also positively impacts the development of safety climate. The findings demonstrate the importance of <b>technical</b> <b>skill</b> of project personnel in managing construction safety. The findings also indicate that the implementation of safety tasks is essential for developing safety climate, thus construction companies should consider to include these tasks into their safety management program. It is also suggested that construction companies should incorporate relevant safety aspects into their <b>technical</b> <b>skill</b> development programs, thus project personnel can use their <b>technical</b> <b>skill</b> to improve the levels of safety task implementation and safety climate development...|$|R

5|$|In Ronaldo's absence, however, Nani's {{style has}} {{developed}} into {{that of a}} more traditional winger; while being able to play on both wings, he is more comfortable on the right, {{where he has been}} known to utilise his pace, ball control, <b>technical</b> <b>skills</b> and trickery to create space and provide crosses for teammates. While capable of cutting off both wings to strike at goal from distance, Nani has substantially fewer goals, yet a substantially higher proportion of assists than his former colleague. Due to his offensive movement, he can also play in a more offensive role, as a forward, inverted winger, second striker, or even in a more central position, as a main striker.|$|E

The fishermen of the region are known to fish in Newfoundland since, at least, 1506. During the reign of John III the Povoan shipmaking art was already renowned, and Povoan carpenters were sought after by Lisbon's Ribeira das Naus shipyard due to their high <b>technical</b> <b>skills.</b> The single floored houses dominated the town's landscape, but there are indications of multiple floored habitations with rich architecture. The seafarers' social class, well-off gentlemen, was associated with this richer architecture around Praça Velha square.|$|E
5|$|William Bruce's {{appointment}} as Surveyor General of the King's Works in Scotland was made chiefly {{for the purpose}} of rebuilding the palace of Holyroodhouse. Aside from this project, he only carried out minor repairs to Edinburgh and Stirling Castles, and to the fortifications on the Bass Rock. Charles I had intended to extend and rebuild Holyroodhouse, and plans had been drawn up in the 1630s. Nothing was done however, and in 1650 the palace was burnt out, destroying all but the west range. Bruce was contracted to design and oversee the works, with Robert Mylne acting as contractor. Bruce's plans were drawn up by Mylne, as Bruce himself apparently lacked the <b>technical</b> <b>skills</b> of architectural drawing.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth Potts was poorly {{received}} by critics. Etty's admirers were angered by his apparent abandonment of history painting for the then poorly regarded field of portrait painting, while Etty's critics {{felt he had}} demonstrated {{that he did not}} have the <b>technical</b> <b>skills</b> to produce high quality portraits, and was simply trying to use his name to make money in the more lucrative field of portraiture. History paintings were generally sold at exhibition for no less than the asking price, and as a consequence often remained unsold. Portraits were commissioned by the subject or their family, providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist. History painting was much more highly regarded as an art form; portrait painting was seen as reflecting nature whereas history painting involved more creativity and also gave the artist the opportunity to tell moral lessons.|$|E
5|$|For his 1896 {{attempt to}} launch the balloon, Andrée had many eager volunteers to choose from. He picked Nils Gustaf Ekholm (1848–1923), an {{experienced}} Arctic meteorological researcher and formerly his boss during an 1882–83 geophysical expedition to Spitsbergen, and Nils Strindberg (1872–97), a brilliant student who was doing original research in physics and chemistry. The main scientific purpose of the expedition was to map the area by means of aerial photography, and Strindberg was both a devoted amateur photographer and a skilled constructor of advanced cameras. This was a team with many useful scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>skills,</b> but lacking any particular physical prowess or training for survival under extreme conditions. All three men were indoor types, and only one, Strindberg, was young. Andrée expected a sedentary voyage in a balloon basket, and strength and survival skills were far down on his list.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{himself had}} {{high hopes for}} his new project. He lacked the <b>technical</b> <b>skills</b> to program it alone, so instead came up with {{concepts}} and consulted technicians {{to see if they}} were possible. He wanted to make the characters different sizes, move in different manners and react in various ways. Yokoi thought Miyamoto's original design was too complex, though he had some difficult suggestions himself, such as using see-saws to catapult the hero across the screen (eventually found too hard to program, though a similar concept would appear in the aforementioned Popeye arcade game). Miyamoto then thought of using sloped platforms, barrels and ladders. When he specified that the game would have multiple stages, the four-man programming team complained that he was essentially asking them to make the game repeatedly. Nevertheless, they followed Miyamoto's design, creating a total of approximately 20kilobytes of content. Yukio Kaneoka composed a simple soundtrack to serve as background music for the levels and story events.|$|E

Recognition of her work included selection as a finalist in the inaugural Helen Lempriere National Sculpture Award in 2000, inclusion in the National Gallery of Australia's 2002 National Sculpture Prize exhibition, and being shortlisted for the 2006 Clemenger Contemporary Art Award. Her works are held in major Australian collections, including the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Art Gallery of New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} of major religious, {{political and social}} leaders sparked a backlash that led Ranavalona to become increasingly wary {{of the political and}} cultural effects of Christianity, which she saw as leading the Malagasy to forsake the ancestors and their traditions. In October and November 1831 the queen enacted a ban on Christian marriages, church services and baptisms for soldiers and members of government studying in the Missionary schools, and in December extended the ban on church service attendance to all Malagasy. From 1832 to 1834, baptisms and church services continued, increasingly in secret. During this time, several Christians each year were charged with witchcraft and exiled or made to undergo the tangena ordeal, and Ranavalona requested the departure of three missionaries, retaining only those whose particular <b>technical</b> <b>skills</b> she viewed as valuable to the state. In 1835, the queen attempted to shut down the press without directly targeting the LMS by banning Malagasy personnel from working at the printing house. The LMS missionaries, capitalizing on the absence of legal decrees against their own work at the press, managed to continue independently printing and distributing materials.|$|E
5|$|United States Army Special Forces (SF) aka Green Berets perform several doctrinal missions: {{unconventional}} warfare, foreign internal defense, special reconnaissance, {{direct action}} and counter-terrorism. These missions make Special Forces {{unique in the}} U.S. military, because they are employed throughout the three stages of the operational continuum: peacetime, conflict and war. Foreign internal defense operations, SF's main peacetime mission, {{are designed to help}} friendly developing nations by working with their military and police forces to improve their <b>technical</b> <b>skills,</b> understanding of human rights issues, and to help with humanitarian and civic action projects. Special Forces unconventional warfare capabilities provide a viable military option for a variety of operational taskings that are inappropriate or infeasible for conventional forces. Special Forces are the U.S. military's premier unconventional warfare force. Foreign internal defense and unconventional warfare missions are the bread and butter of Special Forces soldiers. For this reason SF candidates are trained extensively in weapons, engineering, communications and medicine. SF soldiers are taught to be warriors first and teachers second because they must be able to train their team and be able to train their allies during a FID or UW mission. Often SF units are required to perform additional, or collateral, activities outside their primary missions. These collateral activities are coalition warfare/support, combat search and rescue, security assistance, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, humanitarian de-mining and counter-drug operations.|$|E
