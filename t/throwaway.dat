5|$|The {{scene where}} Candace {{mentions}} that {{her best friend}} Stacy Hirano had become the president of Uruguay was originally written as a <b>throwaway</b> joke for the episode. During an e-mail exchange between the crew, some crew members were curious about the line and Povenmire {{came up with an}} entire back story, in which Stacy meets the prince of the country, moves there and, after changing several laws, becomes eligible for the presidency. The staff enjoyed the idea and wrote it down as a possible plot for a future episode.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Love's Last Shift, {{which never}} again {{performed}} after the 1690s, The Relapse has retained its audience appeal. In the 18th century, however, its tolerant attitude towards actual and attempted adultery gradually became unacceptable to public opinion, {{and the original}} play was for a century replaced on the stage by Sheridan's moralised version A Trip to Scarborough (1777). On the modern stage, The Relapse has been established {{as one of the}} most popular Restoration comedies, valued for Vanbrugh's light, <b>throwaway</b> wit and the consummate acting part of Lord Foppington, a burlesque character with a dark side.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry firmly {{believed}} that <b>throwaway</b> clothes were {{the future of}} the industry, and this idea was incorporated into the costumes of The Motion Picture. William Ware Theiss, the designer who created the original television series costumes, was too busy to work on the film. Instead Robert Fletcher, considered one of American theater's most successful costume and scenic designers, was selected to design the new uniforms, suits, and robes for the production. Fletcher eschewed man-made synthetics for natural materials, finding that these fabrics sewed better and lasted longer. As times had changed, the Starfleet uniforms, with their bright reds, blues, greens, and golds, had to be revised: the miniskirts worn by females in the original series would now be considered sexist. Wise deemed the original multicolored uniforms too garish, and Fletcher {{believed that}} the brightness of these old designs would work against believability when seen on the wide screen—the designer's first task was to create new, less conspicuous uniforms.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} on homeless adolescents has largely ignored {{the distinction between}} those who have left home on their volition (runaways) {{and those who have}} been forced to leave (<b>throwaways).</b> Fifty-two homeless adolescents in Brisbane, Australia, were assessed to compare male and female runaways and <b>throwaways</b> for social adjustment and symptomatology. Differences for social adjustment (antisocial tendencies and aggression) and symptomatology (social isolation and depression) were predicted. Results indicated that male runaways were significantly more hostile than male <b>throwaways</b> (p < 0, 001), and significantly more socially isolated than female runaways (p < 0, 025). Female <b>throwaways,</b> however, were significantly more hostile than male <b>throwaways</b> (p < 0, 025) and female runaways (p < 0, 025). Yet homeless males overall had a significantly stronger urge to act out hostility than homeless females (p < 0, 025). In addition, female <b>throwaways</b> were significantly more antisocial than male <b>throwaways</b> (p < 0, 001). There were no significant differences for depression. A theory of inner social control (Hirschi, 1969), postulating absence of bonding in earlier socialization, was supported...|$|R

However, she is also a time-traveller and a shape-shifter, gliding from Troy to Hollywood, galaxies to intestines, sloughed-off skin to department stores while other poets make heavy weather of one kiss, one kick, one letter... from verbal nuances to mind-expanding imaginative leaps, her words seem freshly plucked from the minds of non-poets– that is, she makes it look easy.|$|E
