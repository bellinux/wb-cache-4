5|$|Antilope, Eudorcas, Gazella and Nanger form a clade {{within their}} tribe Antilopini. A 1995 {{study of the}} {{detailed}} karyotype of Antilope suggested <b>that</b> <b>within</b> this clade, Antilope is closest to the Gazella group. A 1999 phylogenetic analysis confirmed that Antilope is the closest sister taxon to Gazella, although an earlier phylogeny, proposed in 1976, placed Antilope as sister to Nanger. In a more recent revision of the phylogeny of Antilopini {{on the basis of}} sequences from multiple nuclear and mitochondrial loci in 2013, Eva Verena Bärmann (of the University of Cambridge) and colleagues reexamined the phylogenetic relationships and found Antilope and Gazella to be sister genera distinct from the sister genera Nanger and Eudorcas.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its {{construction}} the Albert Dock was considered a revolutionary docking system because ships were loaded and unloaded directly from/to the warehouses. Two years after it opened it was modified to feature the world's first hydraulic cranes. Due to its open yet secure design, the Albert Dock became a popular store for valuable cargoes such as brandy, cotton, tea, silk, tobacco, ivory and sugar. However, despite the Albert Dock's advanced design, the rapid development of shipping technology meant <b>that</b> <b>within</b> 50 years, larger, more open docks were required, although it remained a valuable store for cargo.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, formal {{schooling}} had again become {{a feature of}} the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed <b>that</b> <b>within</b> a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.|$|E

Essentially, polyethnicity promotes the dilution of ethnicity and thus hinders each ethnicity in all aspects of culture.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, several {{historians have}} noted <b>that</b> <b>within</b> the Gaelic-language genealogies and praise-poetry {{concerning}} the MacLeods, Leod's great-grandfather's name appears to equate to the Old Norse Ölvir, Olvér; {{rather than the}} Old Norse Óláfr. There {{are considered to be}} four significant Gaelic-language genealogies which concern Leod's ancestry. These pedigree roughly agree with one another in the three generations after Leod. The greatest similarity between these genealogies are the names of Leod's great-grandfather, variously spelt Oilmoir, Olbair Snaige, Olbuir Snaithe, and Olbair Snoice. Taking into account variances in spelling, these names are now considered to represent the literary Gaelic Olbhar, and the vernacular Gaelic Olghair; both which are in turn forms of Ölvir.|$|E

The entire road was renamed Albany Highway on 2 October 1940, superseding the previously used names Albany Road, Perth–Albany Road, and High Street in Kojonup.|$|E
