40|$|Abstract—This {{paper is}} based on a recent paper {{presented}} in the 2007 IEEE SMC conference by the same authors [1], discussing an approach to predicting energy output from an instream <b>tidal</b> <b>turbine</b> farm. An in-stream <b>tidal</b> <b>turbine</b> is a device for harnessing energy from tidal currents in channels, and functions {{in a manner similar to}} a wind turbine. A group of such turbines distributed in a site is called an in-stream <b>tidal</b> <b>turbine</b> farm which is similar to a wind farm. Approaches to estimating energy output from wind farms cannot be fully transferred to study tidal farms, however, because of the complexities involved in modeling turbines underwater. In this paper, we intend to develop an approach for predicting energy output of an in-stream <b>tidal</b> <b>turbine</b> farm. The mathematical formulation and basic procedure for predicting power output of a stand-alone turbine 1 is presented, which includes several highly nonlinear terms. In order to facilitate the computation and utilize the formulation for predicting power output from a turbine farm, a simplified relationship between turbine distribution and turbine farm energy output is derived. A case study is then conducted by applying the numerical procedure to predict the energy output of the farms. Various scenarios are implemented according to the environmental conditions in Seymour Narrows, British Columbia, Canada. Additionally, energy cost results are presented as an extension.

40|$|For {{the tidal}} current power {{industry}} to progress, simple models for predicting {{the performance of}} <b>tidal</b> current <b>turbines</b> are needed. Currently the aerodynamic models developed for wind turbines are typically used to predict <b>tidal</b> <b>turbine</b> performance. There {{are a number of}} significant differences between wind and <b>tidal</b> <b>turbines</b> so these models will not provide a good representation of <b>tidal</b> <b>turbine</b> performance. The main aim of this project was to show the magnitude of the differences between wind and <b>tidal</b> <b>turbine</b> performance caused by dissimilarities in wind and <b>tidal</b> <b>turbine</b> operation. Two main areas were investigated: the effects of energy extraction on flow speeds and the effect of the proximity of the boundaries. An analytical model was developed which allowed the effect of the number of turbines at a site on the performance of each turbine to be investigated. The magnitude of the change in performance was found to depend on the design and geometry of the turbines and the drag coefficient of the site. The model results indicated that, typically, there will be no noticeable reduction in the power generated by single or small farms of turbines, but installing large farms of turbines will cause significant reduction in the power generated per turbine. An analytical model was developed which allowed the effects of blockage on performance to be investigated. Applying the model to a single turbine in the Sound of Islay indicated that the performance of a realistically sized turbine in an actual tidal channel will differ from that predicted by an aerodynamic model. The effect of the proximity of the turbine to channel boundaries was investigated and performance was found to decrease as the free surface was approached. In all of the areas investigated the performance <b>tidal</b> <b>turbines</b> has been found to differ significantly from the performance predicted by aerodynamic models. This implies that it is not appropriate to use aerodynamic models to predict <b>tidal</b> <b>turbine</b> performance. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|To {{decrease}} {{the need for}} fossil fuels, the alternative energy resources must be not only economically viable but also sustainable in the long term. One {{of the most promising}} alternatives is the marine renewable energy resource. The relatively young marine energy industry is presented with two challenges: first, to deliver a continuous reliable power supply, and second, to minimize potentially harmful effects of the power extraction on the marine environment. The requirement to understand the interactions between a <b>tidal</b> <b>turbine</b> and the surrounding flow environment motivated this work. A <b>tidal</b> <b>turbine</b> mounted on the seabed induces a wake that extends far downstream of the device. As the direction of tidal flow changes, so does the position of the wake with respect to the device. The detailed study of the turbine wake has been conducted by means of computer simulations. An existing finite-volume computer model called the vorticity transport model has been modified to suit the purpose of simulating the wake of a horizontal axis <b>tidal</b> <b>turbine</b> subjected to a nonuniform flow typical of that close to the seabed. High-resolution computer simulations suggest that a progressive fragmentation of the vortical structure occurs during the development of the wake of a <b>tidal</b> <b>turbine.</b> The predicted fragmentation generates small-scale unsteady flow phenomena beyond five rotor diameters downstream of the device in the area previously thought unaffected by the presence of a <b>tidal</b> <b>turbine.</b> The effects of nonuniform flow on the vorticity structure downstream of a <b>tidal</b> <b>turbine</b> and the fragmentation process are analyzed in this work...|$|R
