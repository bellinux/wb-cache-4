Instead of what a lot of hippies and Democrats think, which is we're born innocent and pure and society corrupts us.

Bowman was {{not a fan of}} the episode, saying [...] "The show proved to be much more difficult than I anticipated, and there wasn't enough time to shoot the show properly because we were so close to the Christmas break. I felt extremely pressured and frustrated, although there are things in it I love, particularly the banter between Mulder and Scully. But overall, I thought the show was very oblique. I don't feel that the characters ever {{knew what was going on}} and I don't think it is all that cool <b>that</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> murdering people. I didn't feel like I was shooting an episode of the X-Files, and I think I let Chris Carter down a bit." ...|$|E
