5|$|On 4 August 1995, the CAF had at its {{disposal}} 17 MiG-21s, five {{attack and}} nine transport helicopters, three transport airplanes and two reconnaissance aircraft. On <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> of the operation, thirteen MiG-21s were used to destroy or disable six targets in the Gospić and Zagreb Corps AORs, {{at the cost of}} one severely and three slightly damaged jets. The same day, three Mi-8s were used for medical evacuation. US Navy EA-6Bs and F/A-18s on patrol as part of Operation Deny Flight fired on ARSK surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites at Udbina and Knin as SAM radars locked onto the jets. A few sources claim that they were deployed as a deterrent as the UN troops came under HV fire, and a subsequent UN Security Council report only notes that the deployment was a result of the deterioration of the military situation and resulting low security of the peacekeepers in the area. Also on 4 August, the RSK 105th Air Force Brigade based at Udbina, deployed helicopters against the Croatian special police on Velebit Mountain and against targets in the Gospić area virtually to no effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{full extent}} of {{casualties}} on <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> are not known. Birdwood, who did not come ashore {{until late in the}} day, estimated between three and four hundred dead on the beaches. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage claims one in five of the three thousand New Zealanders involved became a casualty. The Australian War Memorial has 860 Australian dead between 25–30 April, and the Australian Government estimates 2,000 wounded left Anzac Cove on 25 April, but more wounded were still waiting on the battlefields to be evacuated. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission documents that 754 Australian and 147 New Zealand soldiers died on 25 April 1915. A higher than normal proportion of the ANZAC casualties were from the officer ranks. One theory was that they kept exposing themselves to fire, trying to find out where they were or to locate their troops. Four men were taken prisoner by the Turks.|$|E

25|$|On 24 June, the 1st Battalion Battle Group assumed {{control of}} Pristina, {{the capital of}} Kosovo. On <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>day,</b> they {{had to deal with}} murder, kidnapping, torture, inter-communal gun-battles, house burnings, beatings, weapon finds and looting. The number of {{incidents}} reported required all the battalion's subunits. By the afternoon, there were no reserves left. To relieve the problem, an ad-hoc patrol of headquarters staff, including the padre, was formed to assist.|$|E

During the night, the battalion called in a helicopter into the landing zone to take out the worst of the wounded. The American command still had little realization of the situation in Huế.|$|E
25|$|With {{the rest}} of its Front, the 321st participated in the Vistula-Oder Offensive. When the Front's attack began on January 14, 1945, 2nd Shock Army was tasked {{to break out of the}} Rozan {{bridgehead}} across the Narew River, with the immediate goal of taking the town of Ciechanow and then, in conjunction with 65th Army, to eliminate the enemy in the Pultusk area. The 321st, along with its corps, was in reserve, and did not see action on <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>day,</b> nor the following. On the 17th, 2nd Shock liberated Ciechanow, but 116th Corps remained in second echelon.|$|E

25|$|For the commandos, the {{fighting}} was heaviest on <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>day.</b> During {{the height of the}} German attack on the pass, G Troop from 'A' Battalion (No. 7 Commando), under Lieutenant F. Nicholls carried out a bayonet assault after a force of Germans took up a position on a hill on the Commando's left flank from where they began to enfilade the entire position. Twice the Germans came at them and each time the attack was turned back by stubborn defence. Elsewhere that same day, however, Laycock's headquarters was ambushed and in a rather confused action he and his brigade major, Freddie Graham, commandeered a tank in which they returned to the main body.|$|E

25|$|The SEALs firefight with Ahmad Shah's Taliban forces began along a high-elevation {{ridgeline}} called Sawtalo Sar. (The {{highest peak}} of this ridgeline is 2,830 meters (9,282 feet)). A descent down {{the west side}} of the ridgeline leads into the Shuryek valley. The northeastern gulch in which the SEALs became trapped was in this direction, above the village of Salar Ban. To the east of the Sawtalo Sar ridgeline is the Korangal valley. As the wounded Luttrell descended the gulch, he encountered a Pashtun named Mohammad Gulab Khan from the mountain village of Salar Ban. Known simply as Gulab, he took Luttrell into his home <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> and evoked the assistance of others from his village to protect Luttrell until American forces could be contacted. This was in accordance with the cultural tradition of Pashtunwali, whereby asylum (Nanawatai) is offered to a person to protect them from their enemies.|$|E

25|$|The first {{shots of}} the Burnside Expedition were fired on 7 February 1862, in the Battle of Roanoke Island. On <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> of the two-day battle, a force of 19 Union gunboats bombarded, rather inconclusively, four Rebel forts facing Croatan Sound and eight ships of the Confederate States Navy. The Federal ships were parts of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, {{commanded}} by Flag Officer Goldsborough. The Confederate vessels were drawn from a unit led by Flag Officer William F. Lynch, termed the Mosquito Fleet, intended to serve on Albemarle Sound and nearby waters. Two vessels of the Mosquito Fleet were not present: CSS Appomattox had been sent away to Edenton for supplies and did not return {{in time for the}} battle, and schooner CSS Black Warrior was left out, presumably because she lacked the mobility that steam power gave the rest of the fleet.|$|E
25|$|It {{was said}} that Nottingham could not support a tramway company; that there was this, that, and the other special reason why {{it would be all}} moonshine in Nottingham. It was said again that the uneven roads would necessitate the {{employment}} of too many extra horses to make the company pay; but these prognosticators did not know that uneven roads create traffic; that people are ever ready to jump into a car, and even pay a full fare to simply ride {{to the top of a}} hill. Now it happens that these prophets are without honour in their native land. The tramways company is a great success in the town, as we shall see very soon. The first section was opened on September the 18th last year, the running being to and from the Railway Stations, the Trent Bridge , and St. Peter's Church. On <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> 2,277 persons were carried in four inside cars, which were worked by 27 horse, the fare being twopence all the way. But here is something rather good. In the week ending October the 5th (Goose Fair week mind) no fewer than 32,619 persons were carried in five cars; and this result was said by experienced men to be unparalleled in the history of tramways.|$|E

Despite the disadvantages experienced by the Germans in armour, they {{were able to}} gain the upper hand in the morning battle on 12 May, encircling several French battalions.

500|$|On Good Friday in March 2005, Veitch, Albee and {{six other}} women went to a strip club in Riverside and paid for lap dances. Instead of {{accepting}} the dances, they talked with the strippers, telling {{them that they were}} loved and accepted by God, that churches were composed entirely of sinners, and that they would be welcome there. One of the lap dancers cried and told Albee she had often wanted to go to a church but had never done so because she had thought that she would be rejected. The woman accepted a prayer from Albee and hugged her. Albee would later say that talking with women at the strip club <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> changed her life. Because the volunteers received more positive responses than they had expected, they decided to continue to evangelize at strip clubs. To organize these activities, Veitch and Albee founded JC's Girls, with [...] "JC" [...] standing for Jesus Christ.

There was no question of rest—they travelled on by moonlight, moving upwards towards a gap in the next mountainous ridge.
