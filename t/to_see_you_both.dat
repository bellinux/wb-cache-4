6000|$|... "Glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> so ruddy; Cobhurst air {{must agree}} with you. And now, before we say {{anything}} else, {{let me ask}} you a question: Have you had your supper?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even if {{you were}} strong enough, you oughtn't to go," [...] sobbed Rilla. [...] "What would mother do? She's {{breaking}} her heart over Jem. It would kill her <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> go." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Okay" [...] and [...] "Aitakute" [...] (逢いたくて / Want <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>You)</b> were <b>both</b> used <b>to</b> {{advertise}} Kracie's [...] "Ichikami" [...] (いち髪) shampoo range, {{which featured}} Kumi as the {{spokesperson for the}} surrounding marketing campaign.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} long to wait," [...] muttered Almayer. [...] "It is most {{important}} for me <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> go. <b>Both</b> of <b>you.</b> Most important," [...] he repeated, stopping short and looking at Dain fixedly.|$|R
40|$|The {{vindication of}} {{the memory of the}} Civil-Military Dictatorship in {{contemporary}} Brazilian cinema intensifies. This article recollects documentaries of the 1980 s, and ideas and authors that have been examined before in order to attain to discuss the use of testemonies and film footage from the period of the dictatorship on recent audiovisual production, and their mode of performatively assuming the lack – of documents, memory, and images. Uma longa viagem [A Long Journey] and Que bom te ver viva [How Nice <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>You</b> Alive], <b>both</b> by filmmaker Lucia Murat, will be analyzed, among others, from the standpoint of these issues...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean {{either to}} bring her back with me here to her father and to you, or to make an {{appointment}} with her <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> where she is now living," [...] I replied.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, I wont," [...] said she. [...] "But {{what is it}} all about? Did you quarrel {{about calling}} him that? I hate <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> going about, and not {{speaking}} to each other." ...|$|E
6000|$|I do {{wish you}} and Mr. Babington would think {{better of it}} and come north this summer. We should be so glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>both.</b> Do reconsider it.--Believe me, my dear Maud, ever your most affectionate cousin, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may readily {{believe it}} now, lad, more {{especially}} since <b>you</b> have <b>seen</b> {{how easy it}} is for one who was almost a royalist to become a good American, and now I am speaking of yourself. Enlist wherever you will, and I will take it upon myself <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that <b>both</b> <b>you</b> lads rise in the service as rapidly as you shall deserve." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wouldn't," [...] Maggie {{interrupted}} quietly. [...] "There {{are just}} two things in life no girl accepts advice upon--the way she does her hair and the man she means <b>to</b> marry. <b>You</b> <b>see,</b> <b>both</b> are decided by instinct. I shall know before dawn to-morrow what I mean to do, but until then nothing that anybody could say would make any difference. Besides, your mind ought {{to be full of}} your own matrimonial affairs. I hear that Naida is talking of going back to Russia next week." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{would not}} talk so, Mr. Heathcliff,' I interposed. 'Let your will be a while: you'll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet! I never {{expected}} that your nerves would be disordered: they are, at present, marvellously so, however; and almost entirely through your own fault. The way you've passed these three last days might knock up a Titan. Do take some food, and some repose. You need only look at yourself in a glass <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how <b>you</b> require <b>both.</b> Your cheeks are hollow, and your eyes blood-shot, like a person starving with hunger and going blind with loss of sleep.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hearty, sir, hearty, thank 'ee," [...] {{replied the}} outline, {{advancing}} {{and becoming a}} little more visible on the surface as he did so. [...] "Hallo! Le Rue, how are 'ee? Glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>both.</b> Step in. A good fire on a coldish night is cheery--ain't it, Mister Redding?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay a moment, Mr. Gray," [...] {{said the}} lawyer. [...] "You {{are going to}} town, and will not think it a trouble to see Mrs. Smith safely back to her hotel. You can talk these things over with our fair friend on the way. To-morrow, at ten, I trust <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I can't {{tell you}} how glad I am <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> again!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "We've heard strange stories--or rather Arthur has--from his friend Lady Delahaye, and at last we decided {{to come over and}} find out all about it for ourselves. Don't take any notice of Arthur," [...] he added under his breath, [...] "he's not quite himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear, dear me!" [...] cried Mr. Finch, impatiently conceding {{to me one}} {{precious}} {{moment of}} his attention. [...] "Don't bother about Grosse! Grosse is ill in London. There is a note for you from Grosse.--Take care of the door-step, dear Oscar," [...] he went on, in his deepest and gravest bass notes. [...] "Mrs. Finch is so anxious <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> We have <b>both</b> looked forward to your arrival with such eager hope--such impatient affection, so to speak. Let me put down your hat. Ah! how you must have suffered! Share my trust in an all-wise Providence, and meet this trial with cheerful submission as I do. All is not lost yet. Bear up! bear up!" [...] He threw open the parlor door. [...] "Mrs. Finch! compose yourself. Our dear adopted son. Our afflicted Oscar!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> Captain Campbell, <b>both</b> {{for your}} own sake and for that of Turenne, whom I greatly love and admire. As I was with Mielleraye during the {{campaign}} in the south, while you were with Turenne, we did not meet there, for though he once rode over and stayed {{for a few days}} you did not accompany him. But he has told me of your adventure at Turin, and has spoken of your diligent studies and your desire to learn all that is known of the art of war. I shall be glad indeed to have you riding with me, for I, too, am a diligent student in the art, though until last year I had no opportunity whatever of gaining practical knowledge. I envy Turenne his good fortune in having been sent to begin to learn his duty when he was but fourteen. He tells me that you were but a year older when you rode to Italy with him. It humiliates me to think that while I am sent to command an army simply because my father is a prince of the blood, Turenne gained every step by merit, and is a general {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother was an enemy of the cardinal and defied alike his power and that of the king. However, I hope to show that I am not altogether unworthy of my position; and at least, like Turenne, I can lead my troops into battle, and fight in their front, even if I cannot always come out victorious. Where have you put up your horses? With the best will in the world, I cannot put either room or stable at your disposal today, for I believe that every cupboard in the house is occupied; but at our halting place tomorrow we shall be under canvas, and a tent shall be assigned to you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "She's {{too good}} for you evidently; she is like you, but {{something}} better than you--no beauty, though; yet when she rose (for I looked back <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> walk away) I thought her figure and carriage good. These foreigners understand grace. What the devil has she done with Pelet? She has not been married to him three months--he must be a spoon!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, my sons, {{it is too}} feeling-full <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> {{so happy}} {{and again in the}} old home. I haf no words to outpour my gratitude, and can only ask of the dear Gott in Himmel to bless and keep you all,' cried Professor Bhaer, trying to gather all four into his arms at once, while tears rolled down his cheeks, and his English failed him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Peace! peace!" [...] {{cried the}} prince impatiently. [...] "I am very well {{able to look}} to my own vows and their performance. We hope <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> in the banquet-hall anon. Meanwhile you will attend upon us with our train." [...] He bowed, and Chandos, {{plucking}} Sir Oliver by the sleeve, led them both away {{to the back of}} the press of courtiers.|$|E
6000|$|Chasuble. [Bowing.] A {{classical}} allusion merely, {{drawn from the}} Pagan authors. I shall <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> no doubt at Evensong? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Rupert is here," [...] he said, [...] "and I {{have brought}} him over <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> <b>Both</b> he and Lucy {{appeared}} {{to think it}} might be well not to disturb you to-night; but I knew you better. Who should be at your side at this bitter moment, my dear Miles, if it be not Rupert, your old friend and play-mate; your fellow truant, as one might say, and almost your brother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Blixum and philosophy! If {{you wish}} to succeed with Alida, Patroon, you must put more briskness into the adventure. The girl has a cross of the Frenchman in her temper, and none of your {{deliberations}} and taciturnities will gain the day. This visit to the Lust in Rust is Cupid's own handywork, and I hope <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> return to town as amicable as the Stadtholder and the States General after a sharp struggle for the year's subsidy has been settled by a compromise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{that will}} do. But I think {{it right to}} tell Mr Cradell that I am glad he {{did not come to}} me. Your friend, Mr Cradell, did me the honour of calling on me at the theatre yesterday, at half-past four; but I was in the slings then and could not very well come down to him. I shall be happy <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> any day at five, and to bury all unkindness with a chop and glass at the Pot and Poker, in Bow Street." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Dombey,' {{said the}} Major, 'I'm glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> I'm proud <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> There {{are not many}} men in Europe to whom J.

6000|$|Rinaldo {{could not}} find words to express his sense of the devil's good-will, nor of that of Foul Mouth himself. He said: [...] "Ashtaroth, I am as sorry to part with you {{as if you were}} a brother; and I {{certainly}} do believe that nobleness of spirit exists, as you say, among your people below. I shall be glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> sometimes, if you can come; and I pray God (if my poor prayer be worth any thing) that you may all repent, and obtain his pardon; for without repentance, you know, nothing can be done for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Neither of {{them said}} a word, and though all facts had {{suddenly}} ceased to matter anything, I went on informatively, [...] "He is {{to be taken to}} Downing Street where there is a proper staff, so {{that there will be no}} need of me. [...] . Of course, you're a little perplexed at my being with Melmount. You see I met him--by accident--directly I recovered. I found him with a broken ankle--in that lane. [...] . I am to go now to the Four Towns to help prepare a report. So that I am glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> again"--I found a catch in my voice--"to say good-bye to you, and wish you well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} hoped much, Nelly, but {{remember}} always, that I have always cared for you. Since you first became Jack's friend I have cared for you. If {{he had loved}} you I could even stand aside and be glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> happy, but I have known always that this could never be. Jack's mind was ever so much given up to study, he is not like us, and does not dream of a house and love till he has made his mark in the world. Remember only that I love you as you love Jack, and shall love as faithfully. Some day, perhaps, long hence," [...] he added as Nelly shook her head, [...] "you may not think differently, but may come {{to see that it}} is better to make one man's life happy than to cling for ever to the remembrance of another. At any rate you will always think of me as your true friend, Nelly, always trust me?" ...|$|E
