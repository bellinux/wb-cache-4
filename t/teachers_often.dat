5|$|Discarding one's {{corrective}} lenses, as Bates recommended, or wearing lenses {{weaker than}} one's prescribed correction, as some Bates method advocates suggest, poses a potential safety hazard in certain situations, especially {{when one is}} operating a motor vehicle. James Randi related that his father, shortly after discarding glasses {{on the advice of}} Bates' book, wrecked his car. Bates method <b>teachers</b> <b>often</b> caution that when driving, one should wear the correction legally required.|$|E
5|$|Considering that he {{majored in}} {{political}} science and economics, Kanō's family thought that after graduating from university, he would pursue a career in some government ministry. Indeed, through influential friends of his father's, he was initially offered a position with the Ministry of Finance. However, his love for teaching led him instead to accept a position teaching at Gakushuin. The students of Japan's elite attended Gakushuin and were of higher social positions than their teachers. The students were allowed to ride in rickshaws (jinrikisha) right to {{the doors of the}} classes, whereas teachers were forbidden. The <b>teachers</b> <b>often</b> felt compelled to visit the homes of these students whenever summoned to give instruction or advice. In effect, the teachers were treated as servants.|$|E
25|$|Some {{other forms}} of martial arts require {{students}} to wear a uniform during practice. In general, tàijíquán schools do not require a uniform, but both traditional and modern <b>teachers</b> <b>often</b> advocate loose, comfortable clothing and flat-soled shoes.|$|E

25|$|Berdella {{performed}} academically {{well in his}} studies, though <b>teachers</b> <b>often</b> {{found him}} difficult to teach, in part due both his , and his being the recipient of bullying by other students. Resultantly, as a child, he also seldom socialized in social activities at school with his peers.|$|E
25|$|DoDDS schools {{overseas}} and DDESS {{schools in the}} United States tend to be smaller than many public schools. Students and <b>teachers</b> <b>often</b> interact in a more social manner with one another. When returning to civilian schools, the lack of camaraderie with the faculty can be an unexpected obstacle for many highly mobile families.|$|E
25|$|The OLPC XO-1 {{hardware}} lacks connectivity {{to external}} monitors or projectors, {{and teachers are}} not provided with software for remote assessment. As a result, students are unable to present their work to the whole class, and teachers must also assess students' work from the individual laptops. <b>Teachers</b> <b>often</b> {{find it difficult to}} use the keyboard and screen, which were designed with student use in mind.|$|E

He was born four years after his parents married, at the ages of fifty (George) and forty (Anna). His mother was the {{daughter}} of a whaling captain based in Sag Harbor, Long Island, and his family returned there for their summer vacations. He began drawing well before kindergarten, and his elementary–school <b>teachers</b> <b>often</b> asked him to decorate their classroom blackboards at Thanksgiving and Christmas.|$|E
500|$|Following Victoria Climbié's death, the {{agencies}} in the case, {{as well as the}} child services system in general, were widely criticised. Milburn said, [...] "this was not a failing on the part of one service, it was a failing on the part of every service". Fox said Climbié's case amounted to [...] "a shocking tale of individual professional failure and systemic incompetence". Burstow said, [...] "there is a terrible sense of déjà vu in the Laming Report. The same weaknesses have led to the same mistakes, with the same missed opportunities to save a tortured child's life". Labour Party Member of Parliament Karen Buck said, [...] "the Bayswater families unit told me that there must be hundreds of other Climbié cases waiting to happen", and [...] "the Victoria Climbié inquiry highlighted how easy it is for vulnerable families to fall through the net, especially if they do not have English as a first language and are highly mobile". The 1999 Department of Health document, Working Together to Safeguard Children (now superseded), set out child protection guidance to doctors, nurses, and midwives. The Royal College of Nursing, however, said that there was evidence that many nurses did not receive proper training in these areas. Denise Platt, chief inspector of the social services inspectorate (SSI), said doctors, police officers and <b>teachers</b> <b>often</b> thought their only responsibility was to help social services, forgetting that they had a distinct role to play. Mike Leadbetter, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said that many health professionals were [...] "not engaged in child protection". After the inquiry, there was a feeling that senior managers had managed to escape responsibility and that only junior staff members were punished. Burstow said, [...] "the majority of children who die from abuse or neglect in this country know the perpetrator; it is within the family and by 'friends' that most abuse occurs. As a society we are still in denial about that hard truth".|$|E
2500|$|The Space Factor– Space {{refers to}} the amount of space created by the moving of the mouth and the {{position}} of the palate and larynx. Generally speaking, a singer's mouth should be opened wider the higher they sing. The internal space or position of the soft palate and larynx can be widened by the relaxing of the throat. Voice <b>teachers</b> <b>often</b> describe this as feeling like the [...] "beginning of a yawn".|$|E

2500|$|Reed {{maintains}} a 9:1 student-to-faculty ratio, and its small classes emphasize a [...] "conference" [...] style where the <b>teacher</b> <b>often</b> {{acts as a}} mediator for discussion rather than a lecturer. While large lecture-style classes exist, Reed emphasizes its smaller lab and conference sections.|$|R
50|$|This {{makes the}} teacher-in-charge the authentically supreme {{leader of the}} council. The <b>teacher</b> <b>often</b> unconstitionally speaks in the council and {{sometimes}} stops the hon. councilors from making statements therein as he might deem fit even though he assumes no seat in the council pursuant to the constitution.|$|R
2500|$|Describing vocal {{sound is}} an inexact science {{largely because the}} human voice is a {{self-contained}} instrument. Since the vocal instrument is internal, the singer's ability to monitor the sound produced {{is complicated by the}} vibrations carried to the ear through the Eustachean (auditory) tube and the bony structures of the head and neck. In other words, most singers hear something different in their ears/head than what a person listening to them hears. As a result, voice <b>teachers</b> <b>often</b> focus less on how it [...] "sounds" [...] and more on how it [...] "feels". Vibratory sensations resulting from the closely related processes of phonation and resonation, and kinesthetic ones arising from muscle tension, movement, body position, and weight serve as a guide to the singer on correct vocal production.|$|E

5000|$|The {{intention}} of a trigger film is to [...] "trigger" [...] {{a discussion about}} the short scenes presented in the movie and how the characters reacted to the situation, and how each viewer would handle that situation differently. The <b>teacher</b> <b>often</b> serves as a mediator, perhaps offering his or her own insights, but most of the discussion is left to the students.|$|R
50|$|The school employs around 80 teachers, {{along with}} {{laboratory}} and IT technicians. The <b>teachers</b> <b>often</b> have both {{upper and lower}} school classes on two sites.|$|E

50|$|In addition, {{the term}} magister {{relates to the}} {{emphasis}} on authoritative <b>teachers.</b> <b>Often</b> this {{is seen in the}} names of theological schools descending from magisterial reformers (e.g. Lutheran, Calvinist, and Zwinglian).|$|E
