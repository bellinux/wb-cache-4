A drawing on a tree stump of Link, Tatl, Tael, the Skull Kid, and the Four Giants is shown after.|$|E
5|$|In Peru, {{they are}} {{occasionally}} shot, {{but more often}} revered and used for ceremonial purposes. The Yawar Fiesta is a celebration, the pinnacle {{of which is the}} tying of an Andean condor to the back of a bull, allowing the condor to kill the bull with its talons before being released. This ceremony is a symbolic representation {{of the power of the}} Andean peoples (the condor) over the Spanish (the bull). There is also a ceremony known as the arranque del condor in which a live Andean condor is suspended from a frame and is punched to death by horsemen as <b>they</b> <b>ride</b> by.|$|E
5|$|In the oil platform, Chris and Piers head underground, {{managing}} to free Jake and Sherry from captivity before preventing a large-scale attack by a gigantic bioweapon called Haos from the location. Heavily wounded, {{and in a}} desperate attempt to save Chris, Piers injects himself with a sample of the C-virus to help turn the tide of the battle, temporarily defeating Haos before evacuating. Aware that the mutation would worsen, Piers sacrifices himself by pushing Chris to an escape pod. After Chris' pod is launched, Haos makes one last attempt to kill Chris but is killed himself by a powerful lightning charge from Piers, which ensures Chris' escape and the destruction of the Neo-Umbrella base. At the same time, Jake and Sherry escape the facility pursued relentlessly by Ustanak, eventually {{managing to}} kill him as <b>they</b> <b>ride</b> a rocket-powered lift back to the surface.|$|E

60|$|Clouds {{of black}} impalpable dust rose as <b>they</b> <b>rode</b> along. The eyes, mouth, and {{nostrils}} {{were filled with}} it, and they were literally as black as the ground over which <b>they</b> <b>rode.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Scunthorpe {{side were}} known as Scunthorpe Saints from 1972 to 1979 when <b>they</b> <b>rode</b> at Quibell Park Stadium on Brumby Wood Lane, and then Scunthorpe Stags from 1979 to 1985 when <b>they</b> <b>rode</b> at Ashby Ville.|$|R
5|$|The Doctor and Clara {{attend the}} ceremony, where the Doctor {{explains}} {{that since the}} Rings were settled {{there has been a}} constant song sung to keep an angry god asleep. The people fear that the god, which they call Grandfather, will awaken and consume the entire universe if the song is ever interrupted. Merry begins singing, joined by a chorister at the pyramid. During the song, a mummy in a glass case at the pyramid begins to awaken. Merry panics, believing she got the song wrong. A beam of light from the pyramid envelops her, and she is pulled toward the pyramid and the mummy. The Doctor and Clara find Dor'een and rent the space bike using Clara's mother's ring as payment. <b>They</b> <b>ride</b> the bike to the pyramid where they find the mummy struggling to escape the case and consume Merry's soul. The Doctor promises Merry that she does not have to sacrifice herself and that he will stop Grandfather. As they attempt to leave, a group of creatures called the Vigil arrive and attempt to force Merry to sacrifice herself. The Doctor holds the Vigil at bay long enough to let Clara and Merry escape from the throne room, but then the case shatters and the mummy breaks free. A ray of light strikes the planet, revealing that Grandfather is Akhaten itself, a planet-sized parasitic creature.|$|E
5|$|Will and Cal {{attempt to}} rescue Chester {{before he is}} sent to the deeps on the 'Miner's Train', but the Styx arrive and they are forced to leave Chester behind. During the botched escape attempt, it is {{revealed}} that Rebecca, Will's adoptive sister, is actually a Styx implanted in his family to monitor him. The boys head through a series of tunnels to the Eternal City, and old stone city, estimated by Will to be from Roman times, where the air is filled with deadly bio-toxins. They avoid the Styx soldiers, who patrol the city with their vicious stalker attack dogs, and eventually emerge {{on the bank of the}} Thames. Will makes for his home in Highfield, but there Will's health deteriorates, so Cal helps him to his Auntie Jean's flat where he recovers. Soon they return underground to find Will's adoptive father, and attempt to rescue Chester once again. They encounter another Styx patrol, and Uncle Tam kills a member of the Styx, whom he calls Crawfly, but is mortally wounded in the fight, and the strong willed Uncle Tam chooses to stay behind to give the boys time to escape. With the help of Imago Freebone, a member of Uncle Tam's gang, Will and Cal escape to a small hiding place halfway between the Colony and the Eternal City. There, they rest and mourn for Uncle Tam; and are told by Imago that Chester's train to the deeps will pass directly under their hiding spot shortly. They jump down into the train through a hole in the floor of the hiding spot, and find Chester. Together <b>they</b> <b>ride</b> down to the Deeps. In the book's epilogue, Rebecca kills Imago, who was hiding on the surface, by poison.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Aladdin, Jasmine appears in the film's two direct-to-video sequels, in both of which Larkin reprises her role as the character, with Liz Callaway {{replacing}} Salonga as her singing voice. The first, The Return of Jafar (1994), features Jasmine as she begins to question her trust in Aladdin after he defends Jafar's former pet parrot, Iago, who escapes Jafar's lamp and rescues Aladdin from bandits, hoping to make amends with the royal family. However, Iago manages to convince the princess that she still very much trusts Aladdin. Jasmine eventually befriends Iago after he helps mend her and Aladdin's relationship, frees the Genie, and ultimately risks his life to defeat Jafar, who has returned seeking vengeance. In the second, Aladdin and the King of Thieves (1996), Jasmine's long-awaited wedding to Aladdin is interrupted by the Forty Thieves. The Oracle, which the thieves are attempting to steal, reveals that Aladdin's father Cassim is still alive and their leader. Encouraging Aladdin to pursue his father, Jasmine agrees to postpone the wedding but can't help but worry for him during his absence. When Aladdin finally returns to Agrabah with Cassim and introduces him, Jasmine and the Sultan take an immediate liking to him. However, Cassim is soon imprisoned by the Sultan after he attempts to steal the Oracle again. Aladdin frees Cassim and accepts punishment for his actions until Jasmine convinces her father {{that he was only}} helping is father out of love. Iago returns to inform them that Cassim has been captured by Sa'luk and the remaining Thieves. Jasmine goes with Aladdin to rescue his father, and afterward they return for their wedding, which Cassim attends from the shadows. They go for a ride on Carpet, waving good-bye to the Merchant from the first film and Iago and Cassim as <b>they</b> <b>ride</b> off. Jasmine appears in the animated television series based on the film, which originally aired from 1994 to 1995.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>rode</b> {{halfway to}} Conjeveram, and stopped {{for the night}} at a village--the men {{sleeping}} in the open air, while the Rajah, his sons, and Dick, were entertained by the chief man of the place.

50|$|At Seoul Land, {{teams had}} {{to ride a}} rollercoaster and watch out for a complex {{mathematical}} equation that was being held up on a sign as <b>they</b> <b>rode</b> the <b>ride.</b> If <b>they</b> solved it {{by the end of}} the <b>ride,</b> <b>they</b> received their next clue. Otherwise, <b>they</b> had to <b>ride</b> the rollercoaster again.|$|R

25|$|They {{are also}} called the Fell Riders and the Black Wings (when <b>they</b> <b>ride</b> the fell beasts), {{as well as the}} Shadows, the Servants of Sauron, and the Nine Servants of the Lord of the Rings. The Orcs of the Tower of Cirith Ungol call them Shriekers.|$|E
25|$|Sandhill cranes' large wingspans, {{typically}} , {{make them}} very skilled soaring birds, similar in style to hawks and eagles. Using thermals to obtain lift, {{they can stay}} aloft for many hours, requiring only occasional flapping of their wings and consequently expending little energy. Migratory flocks contain hundreds of birds, and can create clear outlines of the normally invisible rising columns of air (thermals) <b>they</b> <b>ride.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{few months}} pass after the Signers' victory over Yliaster, {{and the former}} members of Team 5D's move {{on with their lives}} {{following}} separate paths. They all part ways, except for Yusei, who decides to stay in New Domino City. The other Signers decide that they will return after fulfilling their dreams. As <b>they</b> <b>ride</b> together one last time, the Crimson Dragon removes their Signer marks, as their mission as Signers is accomplished.|$|E

25|$|The 1982 French-Italian film That Night in Varennes {{is about}} a fictional meeting of Casanova, Chevalier de Seingalt (played by Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni), Nicolas Edmé Restif de la Bretonne, Countess Sophie de la Borde, and Thomas Paine (played by American actor Harvey Keitel) as <b>they</b> <b>ride</b> in a {{carriage}} a few hours behind the carriage carrying the King and Queen of France, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, on their attempt to escape from revolutionary France in 1791.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{consciousness}} {{can refer to}} voluntary action, awareness, or wakefulness. However, even voluntary behaviour involves unconscious mechanisms. Many cognitive processes {{take place in the}} cognitive unconscious, unavailable to conscious awareness. Some behaviours are conscious when learned but then become unconscious, seemingly automatic. Learning, especially implicitly learning a skill, can take place outside of consciousness. For example, plenty of people know how to turn right when <b>they</b> <b>ride</b> a bike, but very few can accurately explain how they actually do so.|$|E
25|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{of the mechanical}} system {{is the use of}} breaker points to interrupt the low-voltage high-current through the primary winding of the coil; the points are subject to mechanical wear where <b>they</b> <b>ride</b> the cam to open and shut, as well as oxidation and burning at the contact surfaces from the constant sparking. They require regular adjustment to compensate for wear, and the opening of the contact breakers, which is responsible for spark timing, is subject to mechanical variations.|$|E

25|$|After the {{starting}} scene, the video shows them at Li'l Indy, where <b>they</b> <b>ride</b> go-carts. Here, black-haired Lavigne is seen viciously bumping {{the car of}} the red-haired Lavigne, causing her to spin around and lose control. Next, the red-haired Lavigne and her boyfriend get inside a photo booth where black-haired Lavigne slips in and grabs the red-haired girl away before they take pictures. Black-haired Lavigne's friends then block the red-haired girl's way (by positioning themselves at the booth entrance) to give her more time.|$|E
25|$|Speed {{cushions}} are a type {{of speed}} hump installation designed to alleviate the negative impacts that vertical deflections have on emergency vehicle response times. Speed cushions installations are typically made up of several small speed humps installed across {{the width of the}} road with spaces between them. They force normal cars to slow down as <b>they</b> <b>ride</b> with one or both wheels over the humps. Meanwhile, they allow fire engines (and other large vehicles) with wider axles to straddle the cushions without slowing down.|$|E

60|$|Both men and horses, however, {{suffered}} {{much from}} thirst; {{and the former}} {{had good reason to}} congratulate themselves on having filled every water-skin at the first halting-place of the preceding day.

25|$|As Yusei Fudo ponders {{the state}} of New Domino City, Jack Atlas and Crow Hogan cheer him {{up with the idea}} of riding on their Duel Runners. As <b>they</b> <b>ride,</b> a mysterious Turbo Duelist called Paradox {{challenges}} Yusei to a duel. Yusei summons his Stardust Dragon but Paradox seals it inside a card and disappears with it. They later discover an article that shows a mysterious battle in the past of Venice, Italy that Yusei knows did not happen in history before. Compounding the situation, New Domino City is vanishing. As a result, the Crimson Dragon appears, giving Yusei's Duel Runner the ability to travel through time.|$|E
25|$|One {{night after}} a party, Peggy decides {{to sleep with}} Charlie. He then flips out and reminds {{her that she had}} rebuffed him the weekend before and {{therefore}} believes she is playing games, then drives her home. Instead of going inside, she takes a walk and ends up at an all-night cafe. As she walks by, she sees Michael Fitzsimmons — the artsy loner in school she always wished she’d slept with - and goes in to talk to him. After finding out they have more in common than originally thought, <b>they</b> <b>ride</b> off on his motorcycle. In a field, they smoke weed and find out more about one another. When he asks if she is going to marry Charlie, she responds that she already did that and will not do it again. After he recites some of his poetry for her, they have sex.|$|E
25|$|Each one has {{at least}} ten or twelve horses, and they have them so well-trained that they follow them {{wherever}} {{they want to take}} them, and they mount first on one and then on another. When they are on a raid, each horse has a bag hung on his nose, in which his fodder is put, and he feeds as he follows his master, and they do not stop going by night or by day. And <b>they</b> <b>ride</b> so hard that they cover in one day and one night fully six days' journey or seven or eight. And while they are on the way they will not seize anything or carry it along, before their return, but when they are returning, then they seize plunder and make captives and take anything they can get. Nor do they go armed, except that they wear a garment of sheepskin and carry bows and arrows.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a glorious}} sight {{to see them}} as <b>they</b> <b>rode</b> madly {{on the heels of the}} Mexicans--a whole company of American cavalry, their horses {{shoulder}} to shoulder, the men bent low in their saddles, their carbines gripped in their hands. <b>They</b> <b>rode</b> in squadrons and in line, not like the shouting, confused mass of the Mexicans--but steady, disciplined, irresistible.|$|R
