5|$|In 1992, {{during its}} time under the {{ownership}} of Britain-based Grand Metropolitan, Burger King experimented with table service. After 4pm, customers would place their order at the counter, and their order would be brought to them at their table. Customers were given complimentary popcorn to eat while waiting for their meal. To coincide with the offering, a series of meals called <b>the</b> <b>Dinner</b> baskets were introduced. <b>The</b> <b>dinner</b> baskets included the Whopper Dinner Basket, Steak Sandwich Dinner Basket, Fried Chicken Dinner Basket, and Shrimp Dinner Basket. In the New England region of the United States, BK sold a Fried clam Basket. <b>The</b> <b>dinner</b> came with two sides, including a choice of a side salad, cole slaw, French fries, or baked potato. Lasting approximately a year, the sit-down restaurant concept was abandoned in 1994 {{in favor of the}} original quick-service formula.|$|E

40|$|Between 1907 and 1911, {{executives}} of American steel manufacturers {{gathered in a}} series of social events and meetings that became known as <b>the</b> Gary <b>dinners.</b> Their founder, Judge Elbert H. Gary, {{chairman of the board of}} the United States Steel Corporation (U. S. Steel), believed <b>the</b> <b>dinners</b> were a lawful way to stabilize steel prices by enabling manufacturers to tell each other 2 ̆ 2 frankly and freely what they were doing, how much business they were doing, what prices they were charging, how much wages they were paying their men, and [...] . all information concerning their business. 2 ̆ 2 The government agreed that <b>the</b> <b>dinners</b> stabilized prices, but took a different view of their legality. It brought suit in 1911, pointing to <b>the</b> <b>dinners</b> as one of the reasons why the court should dissolve U. S. Steel as an illegal monopoly. Nine years later, the Supreme Court held that <b>the</b> <b>dinners</b> amounted to price fixing. The Court went on to hold, however, that U. S. Steel 2 ̆ 7 s resort to <b>the</b> <b>dinners</b> only proved that it lacked the power to control steel prices on its own and, therefore, could not have unilaterally monopolized the industry. Commentators have long questioned the Court 2 ̆ 7 s result on the issue of monopolization. This essay, however, will focus on the Court 2 ̆ 7 s intermediate conclusion that <b>the</b> <b>dinners</b> were concerted action, a result that was by no means obvious in antitrust 2 ̆ 7 s formative period, when the case was decided. I argue that the reasoning that led to this conclusion, especially by the trial judges in the case, can still shed light on the agreement element of section 1 of the Sherman Act...|$|R

There is a wide variety of meals served during iftar, ranging from small plates or bowls vegetable-based courses or saniyyehs (large plates or trays) of a particular meat. Common small dishes on <b>the</b> <b>dinner</b> table are bamia—a name for okra in tomato paste, mloukhiyeh—a corchorus stew—or maqali, an array of fried tomatoes, aubergines, potatoes, peppers and zucchini.
