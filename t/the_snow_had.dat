25|$|In 2008, due to {{a series}} of heavy snowstorms, Seattle's {{transportation}} was paralyzed for a few days, and Crunican's inadequate response to the snowstorm was criticized. Among other things, her decision to use sand instead of salt to clear out the accumulated snow (to limit environmental damage to the Bay) was implicated as a reason for the snow not being cleared out quickly enough. Crunican was also criticized for going on vacation while <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>had</b> not cleared out, and for failing to take responsibility and lacking a customer service mindset.|$|E
500|$|The {{pilot of}} a jet taxiing behind Flight 405, Northwest Airlines Flight 517, a Boeing 757, {{stated that he}} had {{a good view of the}} top of Flight 405's wing, and that there was just enough snow on the {{fuselage}} to [...] "fuzzy" [...] the USAir printing but that the wings appeared to be clear. He believed that <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>had</b> [...] "all but stopped" [...] and was more concerned about the amount of vehicular traffic, such as sweepers and ploughs, than he was about the snowfall. The second officer of Trump Shuttle Flight 1541, which had landed around the time Flight 405 was taxiing, said their Boeing 727 had [...] "picked up a lot of snow quickly during my post-landing walkaround, but by the finish it seemed to be more rain." [...] He described Flight 405 as a [...] "fairly clean airplane." [...] He said that he could not comment on clear ice, but that the wings and fuselage were clear of snow.|$|E
500|$|In 1940, [...] Edmund Godfrey Burr, a Canadian {{professor}} at McGill University, serendipitously stumbled {{on the principle}} of counter-illumination, or as he called it [...] "diffused-lighting camouflage". Burr had been tasked by Canada's National Research Council (NRC) to evaluate night observation instruments. With these, he found that aircraft flying without navigation lights remained readily visible as silhouettes against the night sky, which was never completely black. Burr wondered if he could camouflage planes by somehow reducing this difference in brightness. One night in December 1940, Burr saw a plane coming in to land over snow suddenly vanish: light reflected from <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>had</b> illuminated the underside of the plane just enough to cancel out the difference in brightness, camouflaging the plane perfectly. Burr informed the NRC, who told the RCN. They realized that the technique could help to hide ships from German submarines in the Battle of the Atlantic. Before the introduction of centimetre radar, submarines with their small profile could see convoy ships before they were themselves seen. Diffused lighting camouflage might, the RCN believed, redress the balance.|$|E

500|$|Atypical for November, {{the storm}} {{continued}} northward {{and became the}} most intense cyclone to affect Nepal in the autumn in 50years. The country's Department of Meteorology did not issue warnings for the storm, as no mountain trekking teams requested a forecast. As a result, many mountain climbers and guides were caught off guard, and thousands of mountaineers {{from around the world}} were in the region when the cyclone struck. When the energy from the storm spread into the Himalayan Mountains of Nepal, a process known as orographic lift occurred, whereby the moisture coalesced in mountainous regions. At elevations generally below , the precipitation resulted in [...] of rainfall, reaching [...] in Dhankuta. In some areas, totals were 3,000% of the average November rainfall, which is usually a dry month. At higher elevations, the precipitation caused intense snowfall, reaching up to [...] deep in Dingboche. Gorakshep recorded [...] of snowfall. The Khumbu region of eastern Nepal received rare snowfall, as it is normally part of a rain shadow. The village of Thame was buried for eight days until people could travel freely again; the rarity of the snowfall meant that residents did not have skis or snow shoes. By November14, or five days after the arrival of the storm, <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>had</b> receded.|$|E
2500|$|A severe {{winter storm}} {{blanketed}} the Dallas-Fort Worth area in hard {{ice and snow}} {{the week before the}} game, threatening to disrupt game preparations. [...] Snow fell from the roof of Cowboys Stadium's East end on February 4, injuring six people. [...] Over 3,000 tickets were sold to watch the game in the stadium's East Plaza, which experienced the falling ice tragedy earlier in the week. [...] However, <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>had</b> melted by game time and fans who paid $200 per ticket were allowed to watch the game outside Cowboys Stadium, in the open air, as the weather turned from sleet to sun.|$|E

[...] He arrived in time and took some excellent pictures for Arizona Highways magazine.|$|E

2500|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board {{began its}} {{investigation}} at 2:30 P.M. on October 26, 1947, {{less than an}} hour after the last known communication with Flight 923. Once the wreckage was located, investigators flew a seaplane to a lake near the foot of Tamgas mountain and accompanied Coast Guard members up to the crash site.
