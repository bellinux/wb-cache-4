40|$|Comparing graphs to {{determine}} the level of underlying structural similarity between them is a widely encountered problem in computer science. It is particularly relevant to <b>the</b> study of <b>Internet</b> topologies, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> generation of synthetic topologies to represent <b>the</b> <b>Internet’s</b> <b>AS</b> topology. We derive a new metric that enables exactly such a structural comparison, the weighted spectral distribution. We then apply this metric to three aspects {{of the study of}} <b>the</b> <b>Internet’s</b> <b>AS</b> topology. (i) we use it to quantify the effect of changing the mixing properties of a simple synthetic network generator. (ii) we use this quantitative understanding to examine the evolution of <b>the</b> <b>Internet’s</b> <b>AS</b> topology over approximately 7 years, finding that the distinction between <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> core and periphery has blurred over time. (iii) we use the metric to derive optimal parameterizations of several widely used AS topology generators with respect to a large-scale measurement of the real AS topology...|$|R

5|$|Diary of a Camper {{is a short}} American film {{made using}} id Software's 1996 first-person shooter video game Quake, {{released}} in 1996. It was created by United Ranger Films, then a subdivision of a popular group of video game players, or clan, known as the Rangers. The film was first released over <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>as</b> a non-interactive game demo file. The video is generally considered the first known example of machinima—the art of using real-time, virtual 3D environments, often game engines, to create animated films. The story centers on a lone camper, a player waiting in a strategic location instead of seeking active battle, who faces {{five members of the}} Rangers clan in a deathmatch, a type of multiplayer game in which the goal is to kill as many opponents as possible.|$|E

In spite of that, Muto described the reaction from fans on <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>as</b> largely negative, much to their surprise. It earned an A− grade from Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club, who compared Cinnamon Bun's evolution from a simple-minded character to one of complexity with the progression of the show itself. Sava opined that the theme of life following a broken romance benefits from this complexity. Sava saw the physical cooling of Flame Princess as a crafty metaphor for the personal changes an individual from a former relationship might experience, {{as well as the}} nostalgia felt over such a relationship. Separate from romance, Sava interpreted the battle between the Flame Lord and the Flame King as to demonstrate Flame Princess is a more sensible ruler.|$|E
