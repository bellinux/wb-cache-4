60|$|The chiefs {{were struck}} with horror and alarm. They implored him not <b>to</b> <b>uncork</b> the bottle, since they {{and all their}} people were firm friends of the white men, and would always remain so; but, should the small-pox be once let out, it would run like {{wildfire}} throughout the country, sweeping off the good {{as well as the}} bad; and surely he would not be so unjust as to punish his friends for crimes committed by his enemies.|$|E
60|$|It seems {{strange that}} a species {{armed with a}} venomous sting and {{possessing}} the fierce courage of the humble-bee should also have this repulsive odour for a protection. It is, in fact, as incongruous {{as it would be}} were our soldiers provided with guns and swords first, and after with phials of assafoatida <b>to</b> be <b>uncorked</b> {{in the face of an}} enemy.|$|R
50|$|Each March since 1951 during Ontario's spring break, Myrtle Beach {{has hosted}} Canadian-American Days, {{also known as}} Can-Am Days. Tens of {{thousands}} tourists come to the area for a week's worth of special events. Myrtle Beach is also home <b>to</b> Coastal <b>Uncorked,</b> a food and wine festival held in the late spring annually.

It is used for a variety of purposes including simple patron lounging, meetings, course events and small performances like Afterglow concerts, Traffic Jam events and Interval concerts. It is also home <b>to</b> Krannert <b>Uncorked.</b> Krannert Uncorked is a wine tasting event, for those of age, on Thursdays. Stage 5 Bar also serves cocktails, imported beers and hors d'oeuvres 90 minutes before most performances until performances end for the evening.|$|R
60|$|Despite {{this fine}} practice, however, {{he was the}} shyest of mankind in the {{presence}} of women, and this shyness grew upon him with the years. Was it because he never tried <b>to</b> <b>uncork</b> himself? Oh, no! It was about this time that he, one day, put his arm round Clara, the servant--not passionately, but with deliberation, as if he were making an experiment with machinery. He then listened, as if to hear Clara ticking. He wrote an admirable love-letter--warm, dignified, sincere--to nobody in particular, and carried it about in his pocket in readiness. But in love-making, as in the other arts, those do it best who cannot tell how it is done; and he was always stricken with a palsy when about to present that letter. It seemed that he was only able to speak to ladies when they were not there. Well, if he could not speak, he thought the more; he thought so profoundly that in time the heroines of Pym ceased to thrill him.|$|E

50|$|The {{cycle of}} {{infidelity}} {{is the main}} theme of both the video and the song. It starts with {{a shot of the}} couple's house with Agron telling Messina that she made him breakfast, but he says he is in too much of a rush to eat it. She walks him out, and then he goes straight to a bar and does shots with his mistress, while Agron's character drinks alcohol and pieces together her husband's indiscretions. While Smith performs in the saloon, Agron proceeds <b>to</b> <b>uncork</b> a bottle of white wine {{in the middle of her}} neighbourhood liquor store, drink away her problems, and then eventually set fire to Messina's possessions. At the end of the video, she welcomes him back home as if nothing had happened.|$|E
60|$|In {{this wild}} spot, I {{did not feel}} the sacredness of ancient cultivation. It was still raw, it was no Marathon, and no Johannisberg; yet the {{stirring}} sunlight, and the growing vines, and the vats and bottles in the cavern, made a pleasant music for the mind. Here, also, earth's cream was being skimmed and garnered; and the London customers can taste, such as it is, the tang of the earth in this green valley. So local, so quintessential is a wine, that it seems the very birds in the veranda might communicate a flavour, and that romantic cellar influence the bottle next <b>to</b> be <b>uncorked</b> in Pimlico, and the smile of jolly Mr. Schram might mantle in the glass.|$|R
60|$|They {{thought of}} this {{all the way to}} their destination; but the bustle of {{re-establishment}} in their new place took up all their attention then. But when they were settled, a month later, they heard of Clare's approaching return, though they had learnt nothing more of Tess. Upon that, agitated anew by their attachment to him, yet honourably disposed <b>to</b> her, Marian <b>uncorked</b> the penny ink-bottle they shared, and a few lines were concocted between the two girls.|$|R
60|$|Later that day, in England, a Lord Greystoke ate bountifully {{of things}} he had not killed, and he drank other things which were <b>uncorked</b> <b>to</b> the accompaniment of much noise. He patted his lips with snowy linen to remove the faint traces of his repast, quite ignorant {{of the fact that}} he was an impostor and that the {{rightful}} owner of his noble title was even then finishing his own dinner in far-off Africa. He was not using snowy linen, though. Instead he drew the back of a brown forearm and hand across his mouth and wiped his bloody fingers upon his thighs. Then he moved slowly through the jungle to the drinking place, where, upon all fours, he drank as drank his fellows, the other beasts of the jungle.|$|R
5000|$|The 1972 Miami Dolphins {{became the}} only NFL team to have a perfect winning season, capped by winning Super Bowl VII. It is a well-travelled urban legend that each year the {{surviving}} {{members of the team}} had made a ritual of getting together and drinking champagne when the last unbeaten team loses. In actuality, only a small group of ex-players - namely Bob Griese, Nick Buoniconti and Dick Anderson, who all live in Coral Gables, Florida - gathered <b>to</b> <b>uncork</b> the champagne and have a celebratory drink. The Dolphins never made the now traditional post-game Super Bowl champion visit to the White House during the Watergate scandal in the administration of President Richard Nixon. MSNBC reported that this was a deliberate snub by Nixon, who was a fan of the Washington Redskins, who lost Super Bowl VII to the Dolphins. But finally on August 20, 2013, four decades after their accomplishment, Barack Obama hosted the team, noting that they [...] "never got their White House visit".|$|E
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 2015, Mike Murphy {{explained}} his strategy: [...] "If other campaigns wish that we’re going <b>to</b> <b>uncork</b> money on Donald Trump, they’ll be disappointed....Trump is, frankly, other people’s problem". [...] Later in 2015, Murphy further explained that the PAC's strategy {{was based on the}} assumption that Trump's campaign would inevitably fail, and so the PAC would instead concentrate on defeating other GOP candidates, [...] "candidates in our lane that we can overcome." [...] However, Murphy's decision to target GOP establishment candidates Marco Rubio and Ohio Governor John Kasich, instead of Donald Trump, created dissatisfaction among some major donors to the PAC. Kasich's strategist was quoted as saying [...] "Their super PAC ran a tough campaign, they ran a lot of negative ads. We had to disavow some of the things that our super PAC ran, so I'm sure that Jeb Bush -- I wouldn't speak for him, clearly -- might do things differently if he was in control of his super PAC. I have no idea." [...] In addition, the Super PAC's [...] "decision to emphasize Bush's government experience in a year when voters clearly were looking for outsider cred and a candidate who could channel anger at the establishment" [...] was seen as a wrong strategy.|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the paper}} is to present a new logic of {{technical}} malfunction. The need for this logic is motivated by a simple-sounding philosophical question: Is a malfunctioning corkscrew, which fails <b>to</b> <b>uncork</b> bottles, nonetheless a corkscrew? Or in general terms, is a malfunctioning F, which fails to do what Fs do, nonetheless an F? We argue that ‘malfunctioning’ denotes the modifier Malfunctioning rather than a property, and that the answer depends on whether Malfunctioning is subsective or privative. If subsective, a malfunctioning F is an F; if privative, a malfunctioning F is not an F. An intensional logic is required to raise and answer the question, because modifiers operate directly on properties and not on sets or individuals. This new logic provides the formal tools to reason about technical malfunction {{by means of a}} logical analysis of the sentence “a is a malfunctioning F”. Web of Science 101358154...|$|E
5000|$|Mrs Flittersnoop, his housekeeper, causes trouble a {{few times}} through her lack of {{understanding}} for the Professor's genius. In [...] "The Wild Waste Paper", she throws {{what seems to be}} a bottle of cough medicine into the waste bin. The liquid turns out to be the Professor's elixir of life, which was in the bottle because cough medicine is the only thing that can stop the stuff dead without actually destroying it. Since the bottle was <b>uncorked</b> <b>to</b> allow air in (nothing can live without air), the waste paper in the bin comes to life. Even when stuck up a pear tree surrounded by giant, predatory bits of waste paper, the Professor retains his scientific detachment, wondering if a carpenter's bill would know a saw if it saw one, and if so, whether the gas bill might explode at any moment.|$|R
50|$|The Patriots behind three {{field goals}} by rookie Adam Vinatieri, and touchdowns by Ben Coates and Curtis Martin led 22-0 (a Vinatieri PAT was blocked) {{in the final}} seconds of the first half, but from his 49 Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell escaped a sack and threw a desperation heave to the endzone; in the endzone {{scramble}} the ball was kicked in the air by Willie Clay of the Patriots and caught by the Jaguars' Jimmy Smith for a touchdown. Brunell completed long-bomb touchdown throws to Andre Rison and following a Martin fumble the Jaguars tied the game at 25. Keith Byars caught a late pass at the Jaguars 20 but it bobbled out and was intercepted by Dave Thomas of the Jaguars; Thomas ran back a touchdown but it was wiped out on a cut-block penalty on teammate Chris Hudson at the Jacksonville 33; with three seconds <b>to</b> go Brunell <b>uncorked</b> another desperation heave to the endzone; it was caught with one hand by Jags receiver Willie Jackson off the chest of Willie McGinest, but Jackson was ruled down at the one-foot line. The Patriots finally won on a 40-yard Vinatieri field goal in OT, the first game-winning FG in Vinatieri's career.|$|R
40|$|Mt Etna volcano (Italy) {{typically}} generates lava fountains and Strombolian eruptions {{from the}} summit craters, producing significant emissions of tephra which may cause moderate to high impact both in the atmosphere and on the ground. However, we have also witnessed a number of minor ash emissions that, although far less powerful, may pose considerable volcanic hazards. In this paper, we deal with three ash emissions occurring in 2010 (8 April at Southeast Crater, 25 August at Bocca Nuova, and 14 – 15 November at Northeast Crater), correlating their volcanological features with the associated seismoacoustic signals. We provide details regarding the chronology, eruption column, dispersal of the deposit, and texture (grain size, componentry and morphology) of the emitted ash. Each eruptive episode has also been characterized by means of seismo-acoustic analyses evaluating the volcanic acoustic-seismic ratio (VASR). Furthermore, the source of volcanic tremor recorded from March to December 2010 was localized. The joint volcanological and seismo-acoustic analyses allowed distinguishing two main kinds of ash emissions: types a (8 April and 25 August) and b (14 – 15 November). Regarding the former, the accumulation of gas below a dense cap rock obstructing the conduit vent, giving rise, with the <b>uncorking,</b> <b>to</b> impulsive explosivity, was hypothesized. The latter type instead {{is characterized by a}} longer-lasting and less explosivity, likely due to the existence of open conduit conditions. Therefore, type b ash emissions are less hazardous than type a. This simple model, regarding minor explosive activity, may constitute a starting point to assess the volcanic risk from unexpected explosions...|$|R
6000|$|In New Zealand the taming {{of the sun}} is {{attributed}} to the great hero Maui, the Prometheus of the Maoris. He set snares to catch the sun, but in vain, for the sun's rays bit them through. According to another account, while Norralie wished to hasten the sun's setting, Maui wanted to delay it, for the sun used to speed through the heavens at a racing pace. Maui therefore snared the sun, and beat him so unmercifully {{that he has been}} lame ever since, and travels slowly, giving longer days. [...] "The sun, when beaten, cried out and revealed his second great name, Taura-mis-te-ra."(1) It will be remembered that Indra, in his abject terror when he fled after the slaying of Vrittra, also revealed his mystic name. In North America the same story of the trapping and laming of the sun is told, and attributed to a hero named Tcha-ka-betch. In Samoa the sun had a child by a Samoan woman. He trapped the sun with a rope made of a vine and extorted presents. Another Samoan lassoed the sun and made him promise to move more slowly.(2) These Samoan and Australian fancies are nearly as dignified as the tale in the Aitareya Brahmana. The gods, afraid [...] "that the sun would fall out of heaven, pulled him up and tied him with five ropes". These ropes are recognised as verses in the ritual, but probably the ritual is later than the ropes. In Mexico we find that the sun himself (like the stars in most myths) was once a human or pre-human devotee, Nanahuatzin, who leapt into a fire to propitiate the gods.(3) Translated to heaven as the sun, Nanahuatzin burned so very fiercely that he threatened to reduce the world to a cinder. Arrows were therefore shot at him, and this punishment had as happy an effect as the beatings administered by Maui and Tcha-ka-betch. Among the Bushmen of South Africa the sun was once a man, from whose armpit a limited amount of light was radiated round his hut. Some children threw him up into the sky, and there he stuck, and there he shines.(4) In the Homeric hymn to Helios, as Mr. Max Muller observes, [...] "the poet looks on Helios as a half god, almost a hero, who had once lived on earth," [...] which is precisely the view of the Bushmen.(5) Among the Aztecs the sun {{is said to have been}} attacked by a hunter and grievously wounded by his arrows.(6) The Gallinomeros, in Central California, seem at least to know that the sun is material and impersonal. They say that when all was dark in the beginning, the animals were constantly jostling each other. After a painful encounter, the hawk and the coyote collected two balls of inflammable substance; the hawk (Indra was occasionally a hawk) flew up with them into heaven, and lighted them with sparks from a flint. There they gave light as sun and moon. This is an exception to the general rule that the heavenly bodies are regarded as persons. The Melanesian tale of the bringing of night is a curious contrast to the Mexican, Maori, Australian and American Indian stories which we have quoted. In Melanesia, as in Australia, the days were long, indeed endless, and people grew tired; but instead of sending the sun down below by an incantation when night would follow in course of nature, the Melanesian hero went to Night (conceived of as a person) and begged his assistance. Night (Qong) received Qat (the hero) kindly, darkened his eyes, gave him sleep, and, in twelve hours or so, crept up from the horizon and sent the sun crawling to the west.(7) In the same spirit Paracelsus is said to have attributed night, not to the absence of the sun, but to the apparition of certain stars which radiate darkness. It is extraordinary that a myth like the Melanesian should occur in Brazil. There was endless day till some one married a girl whose father [...] "the great serpent," [...] was the owner of night. The father sent night bottled up in a gourd. The gourd was not <b>to</b> be <b>uncorked</b> till the messengers reached the bride, but they, in their curiosity, opened the gourd, and let night out prematurely.(8) ...|$|R
