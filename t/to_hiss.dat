25|$|At night, the numbat {{retreats to}} a nest, {{which can be}} in a hollow log or tree, or in a burrow, {{typically}} a narrow shaft 1–2 m long which terminates in a spherical chamber lined with soft plant material: grass, leaves, flowers and shredded bark. The numbat is able to block the opening of its nest, with the thick hide of its rump, to prevent a predator being able to access the burrow. Numbats have relatively few vocalisations, but have been reported <b>to</b> <b>hiss,</b> growl, or make a repetitive 'tut' sound when disturbed.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{article in}} the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery found that rescuers and veterinarians in the United Kingdom tended to {{distinguish}} feral cats from domesticated cats based on traits such as their levels of socialization, ownership, and confinement, and {{on the amount of}} fear of, interaction with, and dependence upon humans. They found that rescuers and veterinarians tended to agree that feral cats were cats that had not had much human contact (particularly before eight weeks of age), would try to avoid humans, and would prefer to escape rather than attack a human. However, veterinarians and rescuers disagreed on whether a feral cat would tend <b>to</b> <b>hiss</b> and spit at or attack a human during an encounter, and disagreed on whether adult ferals could potentially be tamed. The article provided a composite definition of a feral cat as a cat that would choose not to interact with humans, could survive with or without human assistance, and would hide or defend itself when trapped rather than allowing itself to be handled.|$|E
500|$|Hiss (or horse laugh) : Rather than [...] "booing", Aggies [...] "hiss" [...] {{to express}} disapproval. Aggies are not {{supposed}} to boo as a [...] "sign of class", and {{are not supposed}} <b>to</b> <b>hiss</b> a fellow Ag. Hissing is a part of a yell called a horse laugh, and usually is accompanied with a hand signal that consists of one's fingers open and palms clasped together, shaken backward and forward.|$|E

500|$|He was Assistant Master at Marlborough College from 1872 to 1875 {{before being}} {{appointed}} Headmaster of Rossall School in 1875. On {{the last day}} of his first year as headmaster, the whole school (with the exception of a couple of students) gathered outside the school <b>to</b> <b>hiss</b> and boo at James. Despite this, he held this position until 1886 and was regarded as having been [...] "brilliantly successful, raising the school in the 11 years of his reign to a pitch of all-round excellence which it had not known before". His students at Rossall included Henry Stuart-Jones, who became a distinguished classical scholar. [...] One of Stuart-Jones's contemporaries later gave James the credit for making Stuart-Jones an [...] "accurate and industrious scholar".|$|E
500|$|Midway {{through the}} first part with its {{rattling}} drums and 'cacophonous' effects a genuine panic broke out. Around {{a quarter of the}} audience rushed for the exits with confusion and anger written over their faces, and those who remained tried <b>to</b> <b>hiss</b> down the 'spectacle', while the conductor Georg Schnéevoigt drove the orchestra to extremes of volume. This whole intermezzo underlined the humoristic-burlesque element in the symphony {{in such a way that}} Carl Nielsen could certainly never have dreamed of. His representation of modern life with its confusion, brutality and struggle, all the uncontrolled shouts of pain and ignorance—and behind it all the side drum's harsh rhythm as the only disciplining force—as the public fled, made a touch of almost diabolic humour.|$|E
500|$|Liszt's {{new works}} {{did not find}} {{guaranteed}} success in their audiences, especially in cities where listeners were accustomed to more conservative music programming. While Liszt had [...] "a solid success" [...] with Prometheus and Orpheus in 1855 when he conducted in Brunswick, the climate for Les Préludes and Tasso that December in Berlin was cooler. His performance of Mazeppa two years later in Leipzig was almost stopped due to hissing from the audience. A similar incident occurred when Hans von Bülow conducted Der Ideale in Berlin in 1859; after the performance, the conductor turned on the audience and ordered the demonstrators to leave, [...] "as it is not customary <b>to</b> <b>hiss</b> in this hall." [...] Matters improved somewhat in the following decades, thanks {{to the efforts of}} Liszt disciples such as Bülow, Carl Tausig, Leopold Damrosch and Karl Klindworth. Nevertheless, audiences at the time found the compositions puzzling.|$|E

The collection also contains documents relating to Rosemary Slacks’s later efforts of to save the Anna Hiss Gym. Anna Hiss was a physical education instructor at The University of Texas at Austin from 1918 until her retirement in 1957. She revolutionized the role of women’s athletics in Texas through her leadership in the Women’s Athletic Association (later named the University of Texas Sports Association), the University’s intramural and club sports, {{the completion of a}} groundbreaking athletic facility, and her overall attitude towards female athletics. Rosemary (Rosie) Slacks continued Anna Hiss’s legacy at UT and was a driving force behind efforts to save the Anna Hiss Gym from demolition in the 1980 s. This collection contains an extensive amount of correspondence, photographs of athletic groups, scrapbooks, agendas of club meetings, rolls taken, pamphlets, posters, newspaper clippings, and other printed materials. In addition <b>to</b> <b>Hiss’s</b> work with U. T. S. A., she was involved with the Campus League of Women Voters, which has a small presence in this collection...|$|R
