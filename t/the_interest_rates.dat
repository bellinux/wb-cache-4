5|$|As news spread, {{other banks}} and trust {{companies}} {{were reluctant to}} lend any money. <b>The</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> on loans to brokers at the stock exchange soared to 70% and, with brokers unable to get money, stock prices fell to a low not seen since December 1900. The panic quickly spread to two other large trusts, Trust Company of America and Lincoln Trust Company. By Thursday, October 24, a chain of failures littered the street: Twelfth Ward Bank, Empire City Savings Bank, Hamilton Bank of New York, First National Bank of Brooklyn, International Trust Company of New York, Williamsburg Trust Company of Brooklyn, Borough Bank of Brooklyn, Jenkins Trust Company of Brooklyn and the Union Trust Company of Providence.|$|E

The lenders agreed to increase the nominal haircut from 50% to 53.5%. EU Member States agreed to an additional retroactive lowering of <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> of the Greek Loan Facility {{to a level of}} just 150 basis points above Euribor. Furthermore, governments of Member States where central banks currently hold Greek government bonds in their investment portfolio commit to pass on to Greece an amount equal to any future income until 2020. Altogether this should bring down Greece's debt to between 117% and 120.5% of GDP by 2020.|$|E

Women traditionally had less access to financial alternatives of ordinary credit lines and incomes. They were seen to have an inequitable share of power in household decision making. Yunus and others have found that lending to women generates considerable secondary effects, including empowerment of a marginalised segment of society (Yunus and Jolis 1998), who share betterment of income with their children, unlike many men. Yunus claims that in 2004, women still have difficulty getting loans; they comprise less than 1 percent of borrowers from commercial banks (Yunus 2004). <b>The</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> charged by microfinance institutes including Grameen Bank is high compared to that of traditional banks; Grameen's interest (reducing balance basis) on its main credit product is about 20%.|$|E

The firm worked for banks and financial groups that filed eviction lawsuits, which had a growing rate at the time because the 1050 ruling of the Central Bank had increased <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> for mortgage loans. The Kirchners acquired twenty-one land lots at cheap prices as {{they were about to}} be auctioned. Their law firm defended military personnel accused of committing crimes during the Dirty War. Forced disappearances were common at the time, but unlike other lawyers the Kirchners never signed a habeas corpus. Julio César Strassera, prosecutor in the 1985 Trial of the Juntas against the military, critizised the Kirchners' lack of legal actions against the military, and considered their later interest in the issue a form of hipocrisy.|$|E

Internationally, he is criticized for his hostility towards some countries, most notably Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States and other Western and Arab nations. In 2007, Ahmadinejad introduced a gas rationing plan to reduce the country's fuel consumption, and cut <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> that private and public banking facilities could charge.

25|$|In 1845 {{the state}} became {{insolvent}} again. Charles Butler, {{a representative of}} the state's debt-holders, arrived to negotiate a second bankruptcy. In exchange for partial ownership of the Wabash and Erie Canal, the only successful public works project, the debt-holders agreed to an additional reduction of the state's total debt to about $4 million, $3 million of which was from the internal improvement projects. The creditors agreed to refinance the debt, which enabled the state to lower <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> that it paid on its bonds. Although the debt still consumed nearly half of the government budget, it had reached a level which the growing state could accommodate.

25|$|The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) {{estimates}} {{that there are}} more than 50,000 credit firms that come under its widened remit, of which 200 are payday lenders.

25|$|The {{liberalisation}} {{of economy}} {{was intended to}} end the government subsidiaries and to reduce {{the role of the}} government in national economy. Successful attempts were carried out by Sharif to expand the role of the private sector, and to redress the imbalances in social services. From 1990 to 1993, the private and foreign investments were greatly relaxed. This was followed by the liberalisation of the foreign exchange which was readily free, and at the same time, <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> were substantially liberalised, credit subsidies were cut, and energy prices were moved much closer to costs. The economic liberalisation and structural reform measures were necessary and had been overdue at that time. However, instead of being pursued with even greater vigor and effectiveness, the liberalisation programme could not substitute for adequate stabilization efforts and macroeconomic stability. By the end of 1993 which was the year of ousting the government of Nawaz Sharif, the benefits from economic liberalisation were seriously limited in the absence of reduction of effective macroeconomic policies. As it grappled with the ongoing foreign exchange crisis in early 1993–97, Pakistan’s most urgent economic need was to raise both national savings and exports.|$|E
25|$|Further {{adding to}} the {{financial}} pressure on the debt situation, in May 1994, Moody's downgraded Canada's debt, citing the high debt levels and concerns about a lack of political will {{to deal with the}} deficit. A vicious circle had been created. The underwhelming 1994 budget was taken as a sign that the Liberals were not serious about eliminating the deficit, which in turn created severe doubts amongst investors holding or considering buying government of Canada bonds that they would be repaid when the bonds matured. As a result, investors cease buying government of Canada bonds, which forced the Bank of Canada to raise <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in order to attract buyers of Canada bonds. The rising interest rates, besides for hindering economic activity and thus hurting the government's ability to collect taxes, raised the costs of servicing the existing national debt, which in turn created further doubts amongst investors that they would be repaid, and thus started the circle all over again. As the vicious circle caused by the lack of investor confidence and rising interest rates continued into the fall of 1994, the 3% target became increasingly unlikely to be achieved, and thus Martin became more and more influenced by Dodge's advice that something more drastic needed to be done than achieving the 3% target.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} equation represents covered {{interest rate}} parity, a condition under which investors eliminate exposure to {{foreign exchange risk}} (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) {{with the use of}} a forward contract [...] the exchange rate risk is effectively covered. Under this condition, a domestic investor would earn equal returns from investing in domestic assets or converting currency at the spot exchange rate, investing in foreign currency assets in a country with a different interest rate, and exchanging the foreign currency for domestic currency at the negotiated forward exchange rate. Investors will be indifferent to <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> on deposits in these countries due to the equilibrium resulting from the forward exchange rate. The condition allows for no arbitrage opportunities because the return on domestic deposits, 1+id, is equal to the return on foreign deposits, (1+if). If these two returns weren't equalized by the use of a forward contract, there would be a potential arbitrage opportunity in which, for example, an investor could borrow currency in the country with the lower interest rate, convert to the foreign currency at today's spot exchange rate, and invest in the foreign country with the higher interest rate.|$|E
