60|$|P.S. Well, anyway, I've cured the chronometer. After {{knocking}} {{about the}} sea for eight squally, rainy days, {{most of the}} time hove to, I succeeded in catching a partial observation of the sun at midday. From this I worked up my latitude, then headed by log to the latitude of Lord Howe, and ran both that latitude and the island down together. Here I tested the chronometer by longitude sights and found it something like three minutes out. Since each minute is equivalent to fifteen miles, the <b>total</b> <b>error</b> can be appreciated. By repeated observations at Lord Howe I rated the chronometer, finding it to have a daily losing error of seven-tenths of a second. Now it happens that a year ago, when we sailed from Hawaii, that selfsame chronometer had that selfsame losing error of seven-tenths of a second. Since that error was faithfully added every day, and since that error, as proved by my observations at Lord Howe, has not changed, then what under the sun made that chronometer all of a sudden accelerate and catch up with itself three minutes? Can such things be? Expert watchmakers say no; but I say that they have never done any expert watch-making and watch-rating in the Solomons. That it is the climate is my only diagnosis. At any rate, I have successfully doctored the chronometer, even if I have failed with the lunacy cases and with Martin's yaws.|$|E

It was predicted that increase in response time would affect total transaction volume and <b>total</b> <b>errors</b> adversely, that is, total transaction volume would decrease with longer response times and <b>total</b> <b>errors</b> would increase. <b>Total</b> productive transactions, the difference between total transactions and <b>total</b> <b>errors,</b> was expected to decrease as response time increased.

The study confirmed the prediction with regard to total transactions and productive transactions: both decreased as response time increased. <b>Total</b> <b>errors</b> actually decreased as response time increased, up to times of 12 seconds. When response time exceeded 12 seconds, errors increased. The impact of response time on productivity suggests nearly all transactions should be completed in 12 seconds or less. Beyond this level, the organization in the study suffered severe penalties in lost productivity. A relationship was also found between increased response times and reduced job satisfaction. ...|$|R

Recently, studies have shown that verbal memory impairments may be associated with comorbid depressive symptoms, but their role in executive function impairments is still unclear. To examine several domains of executive functioning in PTSD and the potentially mediating role of comorbid depressive symptoms in the relationship between executive function and PTSD. Executive functioning was assessed in 28 PTSD patients and 28 matched trauma-exposed controls. The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) with subtests measuring response inhibition (SST), flexibility/set shifting (IED), planning/working memory (OTS) and spatial working memory (SWM) was administered in PTSD patients and trauma-exposed controls. Regression analyses were used to assess the predictive factor of PTSD symptoms (CAPS) and depressive symptoms (HADS-D) in relation to executive function when taking into account the type of trauma. Pearson's correlations were used to examine the association between PTSD symptom clusters (CAPS) and executive function. The mediating effects of depression and PTSD were assessed using regression coefficients and the Sobel's test for mediation.

5000|$|Similarly to the Manhattan update rule, Rprop {{takes into}} account only {{the sign of the}} partial {{derivative}} over all patterns (not the magnitude), and acts independently on each [...] "weight". For each weight, if there was a sign change of the partial derivative of the <b>total</b> <b>error</b> function compared to the last iteration, the update value for that weight is multiplied by a factor η&minus;, where η&minus; < 1. If the last iteration produced the same sign, the update value is multiplied by a factor of η+, where η+ > 1. The update values are calculated for each weight in the above manner, and finally each weight is changed by its own update value, in the opposite direction of that weight's partial derivative, so as to minimise the <b>total</b> <b>error</b> function. η+ is empirically set to 1.2 and η&minus; to 0.5.|$|E

40|$|Thirty {{animals were}} divided into three {{splitter}} groups of ten and were placed upon a half-hour feeding rhythm, then brought together and studied. The conclusions that were made from this experiment may be stated as follows: 1. Rats run without food {{at the end of}} maze, when a reward was presented, and did not show significantly large decreases in time and error scores. 2. The hypothesis that frequency is a factor {{in the development of a}} cognitive map in a maze situation seems to receive no support from this investigation. 3. The introduction of reward after a period of non-reward did not appear to alter the difficulty of the blinds as significantly as hypothesized by Tolman-Honzik. (a) The non-goal-pointing blinds did not appear to become relatively less difficult during the reward period of the non-reward group. Group II increased the percentage of <b>total</b> <b>errors</b> from 56 percent in the non-reward situation to 64 percent in the reward situation. (b) The goal-pointing blinds decreased slightly in difficulty with the introduction of reward for the non-reward group. Group II decreased the percentage of <b>total</b> <b>errors</b> from 44 percent in the non-reward situation to 37 percent in the reward situation. (c) A hypothesis that the animals anticipated the next to the last correct turn of the maze was suggested by the increases in the <b>total</b> <b>errors</b> in right-turn blind alleys. Group II increased the percentage of <b>total</b> <b>errors</b> in right-turn blinds from 38 percent in the non-reward situation to 65 perent in the reward situation. 4.
