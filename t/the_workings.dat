40|$|As {{a result}} of the deposit caving, the {{original}} stress balance of the rock mass is affected; therefore, the stress always increases around <b>the</b> mined-out <b>workings.</b> <b>The</b> stress increase results in the stope surroundings compression distinguished by a certain surface subsidence measurable (the surface also features substantially smaller horizontal shifts as the second vector component of the general movement towards <b>the</b> mined-out <b>workings</b> metacentre). Determination of this subsidence value in relation to the extent and thickness of <b>the</b> mined-out <b>workings</b> is important to recognize the conditions under which a complete failure of the firm overlying layers occurred.

5|$|After the war, he {{was tried}} at Nuremberg {{and sentenced to}} 20 {{years in prison for}} his role in the Nazi regime, principally for the use of forced labor. Despite {{repeated}} attempts to gain early release, he served his full sentence, most of it at Spandau Prison in West Berlin. Following his release in 1966, Speer published two bestselling autobiographical works, Inside the Third Reich and , detailing his close personal relationship with Hitler, and providing readers and historians with a unique perspective on <b>the</b> <b>workings</b> of the Nazi regime. He later wrote a third book, Infiltration, about the SS. Speer died of a stroke in 1981 while on a visit to London.|$|E
5|$|Approximately half of {{all known}} {{antibiotics}} interfere with <b>the</b> <b>workings</b> of a bacteria's ribosome, a large and complex biochemical machine that performs protein biosynthesis by translating messenger RNA into proteins. Macrolide antibiotics clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received a grant to study and design new antibiotics. In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it. The full structure of the ribosome was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated ribosomal proteins, as many of their functions remain largely unknown.|$|E

50|$|Those who had {{signs of}} {{physical}} injury {{were at the}} mine entrance or in its vicinity. The remainder of those killed had {{been working in the}} new working and had no apparent physical injuries. Because of this a conclusion was reached that seat of the explosion had been in the area near the mines entrance and most probably in the area of <b>the</b> old <b>workings.</b> Conclusive evidence for this theory had been found when Archibald Hodge's mangled body had been found within <b>the</b> old <b>workings.</b> <b>The</b> old <b>workings</b> were locked off by a door from the main mine. Hodge had, for some reason opened the door and entered this area. Fire damp was probably present and because Hodge was using a naked flame to light his path, ignited it and caused the catastrophic explosion. There were two suggested reasons for Hodge entering this dangerous area. One was that he wanted to remove some disused rails lying in <b>the</b> old <b>workings</b> and <b>the</b> other was he was eccentric and considered the old working as an area where there was some mystery to be unraveled.|$|R
5|$|Construction was {{not without}} incident. In May 1860, a GNR train {{overshot}} the platform at King's Cross and fell into <b>the</b> <b>workings.</b> Later in 1860, a boiler explosion on an engine pulling contractor's wagons killed the driver and his assistant. In May 1861, the excavation collapsed at Euston causing considerable damage to the neighbouring buildings. The final accident occurred in June 1862 when the Fleet sewer burst following a heavy rainstorm and flooded the excavations. The Met and the Metropolitan Board of Works managed to stem and divert {{the water and the}} construction was delayed by only a few months.|$|E

The subsequent enquiry pointed to errors made by the company and its management leading to charges of negligence against Edward Shaw, the colliery manager, and the owners. Shaw was fined £24 while the company was fined £10; newspapers calculated the cost of each miner lost was just 5 pence.|$|E

5|$|In {{an earlier}} {{disaster}} in May 1901, three underground explosions at the colliery killed 81 miners. The inquest {{established that the}} colliery had high levels of airborne coal dust, which would have exacerbated the explosion and carried it further into the mine workings. The cause of the 1913 explosion is unknown, but the subsequent inquiry thought the most likely cause was a spark from underground signalling equipment that could have ignited any firedamp present. The miners in {{the east side of}} <b>the</b> <b>workings</b> were evacuated, but the men in the western section bore the brunt of the explosion, fire and afterdamp—a poisonous mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen left after an explosion.|$|E

Government records such as the Pipe Rolls, the Memoranda Rolls, and other financial records, some of which are specific to the carucage, have survived, and include records of assessments and receipts for the sums collected. There are also occasional references to the tax in medieval chronicles, supplementing the information found in the financial records.|$|E
5|$|The Thorne Moors Improvement Company {{was set up}} in 1848, {{authorised}} by the Thorne Moor Drainage and Improvement Act. They {{were charged}} with improving parts of the bog.
