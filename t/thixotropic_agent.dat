30|$|Hectorite is a trioctahedral smectite; a 2 : 1 layered {{silicate}} mineral with an octahedral MgO sheet {{sandwiched between}} two tetrahedral silica sheets, with a chemical formula of Na 0.3 (Mg, Li) 3 Si 4 O 10 (OH) 2. However, natural hectorite is a scarce clay often containing many complex impurities, making it challenging {{for research and}} development.

40|$|Cementing is an {{essential}} part of every drilling operation. Protection of the wellbore from formation fluid invasion is one of the primary tasks of a cement job. Failure in this task results in catastrophic events, such as blow outs. Hence, in order to save the well and avoid risky and operationally difficult remedial cementing, slurry must be optimized to be resistant against gas migration phenomenon. In this paper, performances of the conventional slurries facing gas invasion were reviewed and compared with modified slurry containing special gas migration additive by using fluid migration analyzer device. The results of this study reveal the importance of proper additive utilization in slurry formulations. The rate of gas flow through the slurry in neat cement is very high; by using different types of additives, we observe obvious changes in the performance of the cement system. The rate of gas flow in neat class H cement was reported as 36000 ml/hr while the optimized cement formulation with anti-gas migration and <b>thixotropic</b> <b>agents</b> showed a gas flow rate of 13. 8 ml/hr...|$|R

40|$|Oxidic layer {{compounds}} Many oxidic layer compounds {{with the}} ability of intercalation and interlamellar ion exchange are used as colloidal particles or col-loidal dispersions [1, 2]. Most important are the clay minerals in clays (bentonites, kaolins, and common clays). More than 60 million tons of clays are used per year, {{and the application of}} most of this amount is based on the colloidal properties of the clay minerals [3]. A further group of inorganic layer compounds of technical interest are the layered double hydroxides. Crys-talline silicic acids provide alternative materials to the different forms of amorphous silica. The intercalation reactions of many other layer compounds such arsenates, molybdates, niobates, titanates, uranates, vanadates, and wolframates were first des-cribed by Lagaly and Beneke [4]. Several of these compounds are presently studied by Japanese groups because of interest-ing semiconductor, photocatalytic and luminescence properties. M(IV) phosphates are studied in our group as active compo-nents in proton-conducting membranes. Colloid chemistry of clay mineral dispersions The particular charge distribution of the clay mineral particles (constant layer charges and variable, pH dependent edge charges) is the reason of different types of particle aggregation which is of enormous technical importance [3, 5].

40|$|ABSTRACT: During the {{reaction}} of solutions of the leuco dyes crystal violet lactone and N-benzoyl leuco methylene blue with acid-treated montmarillonite (as occurs with carbonless copying papers), most of the offered ye is intercalated within the interlayers of the montmorillonite structure remaining after acid attack. This phenomenon was demonstrated by XRD and also by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. During acid treatment, octahedral cations are dissolved from exposed edges of the montmorillonite lamellae and amorphous ilica builds up in these areas. As a result, the BET(N 2) specific surface area increases from ~ 60 mZ/g to ~ 300 mZ/g and, consequently, the theoretical reactivity towards leuco dyes. Nevertheless, only small quantities of the dye molecules are adsorbed onto the amorphous ilica. The excellent colour intensity and, in particular, the resistance to fading {{in the light of}} the montmorillonite dye complexes may be explained by the protected position of the dye molecules within the interlayers of the montmorillonite. Montmoril lonite is capable of intercalating organic molecules between its unit layers (Fahn, 1963) and such compounds with long-chain quaternary alkyl ammonium ions have attained much importance in the paint industry as <b>thixotropic</b> and thickening <b>agents</b> (Fahn & Buckl, 1968). Reactions of dye molecules with acid-activated montmoril lonite are also becoming important in their capacity as colour developers in the acceptor sheet of carbonless copying papers (von Raven & Fended, 1980; Fenderl &von Raven, 1982). The present paper describes the results of an investigation into {{the reaction}}s of dye molecules with acid-activated montmoril lonite to form light-resistant stable complexes. Particular aspects examined were the amount of dye uptake as a function of time, and the physical and chemical changes occurring in the acid-activated montmoril lonite as a result of dye adsorption...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple method}} for {{depositing}} mesoporous silica films directly on macroporous a-alumina supports is reported. A polymeric silica sol was prepared by hydrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate in acid propanol in presence of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide as template. The rheology of the sol was changed by a modified urea-based <b>thixotropic</b> <b>agent,</b> {{which was used}} in a concentration range between 2 % and 10 % on volume. The dynamic viscosity of the sol was measured {{as a function of}} shear rate. The rheology modifier was found to increase the viscosity of the sol and confer {{at the same time a}} thixotropic behavior to it. Long range order in the unmodified and modified materials was analyzed by XRD on powders after calcination at 500 C. It was found that the pore size increased with increasing concentration of additive, while the degree of order decreased until eventually, at high concentrations, the ordered porous structure collapsed completely. The gradual pore size increase at lower concentration is thought to be caused by swelling of the surfactant micelles by the rheology modifier. The modified sols were deposited via dip-coating on a-alumina disks. The morphology of the silica top layers was characterized by SEM. Pore size distributions and permeances of the prepared membranes were assessed by permporometry and single gas permeation measurements, respectively. The membranes had narrow pore size distributions, with an average diameter of about 2 nm. Permeabilities of H 2, He, CH 4 and O 2 were compared. Hydrogen permeances up to 6 · 107 mol s 1 m 2 Pa 1 were measured at 473 K. The gas flux across the membrane follows a Knudsen-type mechanism, as shown by the permselectivities...|$|E
40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Conventionally, maxillofacial {{prostheses}} are fabricated by hand carving {{the missing}} anatomic defect in wax {{and creating a}} mold into which pigmented silicone elastomer is placed. Digital technologies such as computer numerical control milling and 3 -dimensional (3 D) printing {{have been used to}} prepare molds, directly or indirectly, into which a biocompatible pigmented silicone elastomer can be placed. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to develop a silicone elastomer that could be 3 D printed directly without a mold to create facial or body prostheses by varying its composition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The room temperature vulcanizing silicone composition was divided into 2 components which were mixed 1 : 1 to initiate polymerization in the printer before printing began. Different types of moderators and thixotropic agents were used, and the base composition was varied to obtain 11 formulations. The specimens were printed and polymerized from these formulations and tested for tear and tensile strength and hardness. Ten readings of the specimens were recorded for tear and tensile strength and 6 for hardness. Results were analyzed using ANOVA (α=. 05). Visual assessment of uncured printed specimens was undertaken for 5 formulations to assess any differences in their ability to hold their shape after printing. RESULTS: The tear and tensile strength of the 11 formulations with varying moderators, thixotropic agents, and base compositions were statistically similar to each other (P>. 05). Five of 11 formulations were chosen for the visual assessment as they had sufficient <b>thixotropic</b> <b>agent</b> to avoid slumping while printing. The specimens showed varied slumping behavior until they polymerized. The filler content was increased in the selected formulation, and the tear and tensile strength of the formulation was increased to 6. 138 kNm- 1 and 3. 836 MPa; these increases were comparable to those of commercial silicones currently used for the fabrication of facial prostheses. CONCLUSIONS: The optimum combination of mechanical properties implies the use of one of the formulations as a suitable material for the 3 D printing of facial prostheses...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} get {{approval}} of adhesive bonding as a reliable joining method in the automotive industry, {{a better understanding of}} the interfacial interactions between aluminium surfaces and adhesives is important. It is also important to get {{a better understanding of the}} degradation mechanisms of the bonded systems in humid environments, as humidity is known to have a detrimental effect. This work has been focused on an aluminium alloy and a one-component epoxy adhesive that are of particular interest to the automotive industry. Pretreatment of the aluminium substrates before adhesive bonding is essential. However, the most successful pretreatment processes involve the use of hexavalent chromium, which will be banned from use within few years due to environmental considerations. Alternative pretreatments need to be developed. A literature study identified silanisation with GPS as a pretreatment method with the potential to obtain good durability. On the basis of research performed by SINTEF Materials Technology, AC anodising in hot phosphoric and sulphuric acid solutions were also identified as interesting pretreatment methods. A modified version of the Boeing wedge test was used to determine the durability of adhesively bonded joints tested in hydrothermal environments. The joints were made of AA 6060 -T 6 aluminium alloy and Betamate XD 4600 epoxy adhesive. Both silane films and anodic oxides were investigated using reflection-absorption FT-IR spectroscopy. Other techniques of surface analysis were also used (SEM, TEM, WLI, XPS, ToF-SIMS and contact angle measurements). The environmental durability of pretreated AA 6060 -T 6 substrates was significantly improved after silanisation with GPS. The grit-blasting + GPS pretreatment process resulted in considerable higher durability then the chromic-sulphuric acid FPL-etch. The general understanding is that silanisation improves the durability through the formation of strong, covalent bonds between the aluminium surface and the adhesive. FT-IR spectroscopy strongly indicated that a chemical reaction took place between GPS films and amine curing agents. Particularly interesting was the reaction with dicyandiamide, which is a common curing agent in one-component epoxy adhesives. The amines also catalysed the condensation of SiOH groups, resulting in higher degree of SiOSi crosslink density in the siloxane films. However, chemical reaction is not necessary for improved durability. The hydrophobicity of the bonded surface is also an important factor. This effect has not been studies extensively earlier. Exposure of GPS films to degrading environments showed that the silane desorbed from the surface in acidic solutions, but it was stable in alkaline solutions. The durability of adhesive joints was also reduced in acidic environments. The two models for the degradation of the silanised aluminium surface in acidic environments were proposed: hydrolysis of the siloxane network and corrosion of the underlying aluminium surface. The environmental durability of substrates that were AC anodised in hot phosphoric and sulphuric acid solutions was good, almost as good as the well-established FPL + PAA pretreatment. DC anodising in sulphuric acid gave inferior durability. FT-IR spectroscopy showed that the anodic films formed in sulphuric acid contained significant amounts of sulphate. This can have a significant negative effect on the long-term properties of bonded joints. The anodic films released water during curing of the adhesive. The observations suggested that a transformation from the hydroxide to the oxide state took place. Adhesive bonding in wet environment of substrates that were anodised in sulphuric acid had a negative effect on durability. The effect was more pronounced for DC anodised, than for AC anodised substrates. Bonding in wet environment also resulted in changed adhesive properties close to the oxide surface. Very little <b>thixotropic</b> <b>agent</b> was present in a ~ 200 nm wide region in the adhesive. This was explained by desorption of water from the oxide during curing of the adhesive. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
