The BCBT model assumes that offers concerning inter-node links and point-topoint bandwidth demands can be realized partially. However, in the real-world trade there might be a need to include capacity modularity in the market balancing process. Thus we state the model for balancing communication bandwidth trade that takes into account the indivisibility of traded bandwidth modules. This requires to solve a mixed integer problem and increases computational complexity. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>issue</b> appears nontrivial, as the dual prices cannot be longer used to set fair, competitive market prices.

With the advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs), an AV-based public transportation system has been proposed recently, which is capable of providing new forms of transportation services with high efficiency, high flexibility, and low cost. For the benefit of passengers, multitenancy can increase market competition leading to lower service charge and higher quality of service. In this paper, we study <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>issue</b> of the multi-tenant AV public transportation system and three types of services are defined. The pricing process for each service type is modeled as a combinatorial auction, in which the service providers, as bidders, compete for offering transportation services.

To prevent the bidders from raising their bids for higher returns, we propose a strategy-proof Vickrey-Clarke-Groves-based charging mechanism, which can maximize the social welfare, to settle the final charges for the customers. We perform extensive simulations to verify the analytical results and evaluate the performance of the charging mechanism. Comment: 12 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

In addition, the profit of a WiMAX service provider may increase with Wi-Fi coverage when bandwidth sharing has been implemented but decrease with Wi-Fi coverage when both wireless services operate without bandwidth sharing.

Recognizing the size, importance {{and complexity of}} this market, the major purpose {{of this research is}} to explore and investigate the crucial process of developing Sino-South African partnership relationships in the tourism industry, to facilitate the establishment of business relationships with Chinese travel agents. This study is draws on applied marketing, management and cross-cultural theories on networking to explore the process of developing partnership relationships in the Chinese inbound tourism market to SA. The literature on networking, the development of networking relationships, and the effect of guanxi (connection), a key feature of Chinese business networking on partnership relations are reviewed. Given the limited research conducted on this topic and its cross-country nature, a quantitative research method was adopted for this study. Specifically, this study utilized e-mail survey techniques to explore the relationships between South African inbound tour operators and Chinese travel agents. This study identifies that the process of developing partnership relationships between Chinese travel agents and South African inbound tour operators is culturally embedded. They are giving rise to communication problems that affect partnership relationships. A new stage model of the development of partnership relationships between South African inbound tour operators and Chinese travel agents is therefore developed.

40|$|With the ever-increasingly {{connected}} mobile devices, {{demand for}} mobile broadband service {{is likely to}} outstrip spectrum capacity in the near-term. Without action to address this spectrum crisis, service quality is likely to suffer and prices are likely to rise. Fortunately, recent studies show that {{a large part of}} licensed spectrum remains under-utilized, which should allow concepts such as dynamic spectrum access/sharing, open access, and secondary spectrum market to alleviate the crisis. From the inception of the open access paradigm, it was clear that for it to work two issues must be adequately addressed: sensing and pricing. The first refers to the ability of a device to accurately detect channel opportunity and more generally to acquire information on the spectrum environment. The second refers to mechanisms that provide license holders with the right incentives so that they will willingly allow access by unlicensed devices. For <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>issue,</b> we formulate a contract design problem where a primary license holder wishes to profit from its excess spectrum capacity by selling it to potential secondary users. It needs to determine how to optimally price the excess spectrum so as to maximize its profit, knowing that this excess capacity is stochastic in nature, does not come with exclusive access. We adopt as a reference a traditional spectrum market where the buyer can purchase exclusive access with fixed/deterministic guarantees. When multiple primary holders exist, we develop a price competition model for the license holders selling on a secondary spectrum market. We introduce a regulator which can also be thought of as the sellers forming a coalition, whose role is to enable money transfer based on partial observations of the sellers' actions. We show that by proper design of the transfer mechanism, efficient equilibrium (profit-maximizing) can be achieved. On the sensing front, we propose a spectrum utilization model which uses stochastic differential equations (SDE) to model dynamic scattering and multipath fading channels, in particular, Rayleigh-distributed stationary channels. The SDE model can generate spectrum dynamics as a temporal process, and is shown to provide very good fit for real spectrum measurement data...|$|E

40|$|Pricing {{models of}} Employee Assistance Programmes: {{experiences}} of corporate clients serviced by a leading Employee Assistance Programme service provider in South Africa. Pricing models {{is one of}} the sub-standards in programme design amongst the standards outlined in the Employee Assistance Programme Association of South Africa (EAPA-SA). According to EAPA-SA (2010 : 5), costing an EAP should be based on sound financial principles. Such costing will ensure the best possible application of financial resources with the objective of justifying the balance between expenditure and benefits. However, pricing is identified as a challenging area in the EAP field. Corporate clients are faced with a situation where EAP service providers bid for one contract, selling EAP services which are of a similar nature using varying pricing models with different prices. Such price competitiveness leaves the corporate client with no reason not to overlook the financial consequences of choosing one service provider over the other, since price becomes the critical deciding factor in purchasing decisions. <b>The</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>issue</b> in the EAP field and the impact on pricing models used prompted the researcher to pursue the study to understand the processes and complexities involved in the pricing models in the EAP field. The study focused on two samples which comprised of participants from corporate client who had terminated contracts with a leading EAP service provider, as well as participants from this leading EAP service provider. The research findings indicate that contracting in the EAP field is a complex process owing to a number of factors that have to be considered before contracting. The complexity impacts strongly on the choice of the pricing model eventually chosen for contracting purposes. The views shared by both groups of participants indicate that there are internal and external factors that influence the choice of a pricing model. These are the factors that must be considered when making decisions as to what should be made available to employees and to the company for the effective implementation of Employee Assistance Programmes. Informed by these factors, the researcher developed a guideline that could be applied in practice as a standard EAP pricing model.

H 577 P ISE 2016 Maxi, 163 pages :color illustrationsWith {{the rapid}} {{increase}} of fossil energy consumption, {{climate change and}} environmental problems are receiving closer attention. Starting {{from the perspective of}} sustainable supply chain management, besides procurement costs, a manufacturer (or a buyer) has to pay great attention to the cost of emitting greenhouse gases, which is directly influenced by the green degree of the raw materials from its suppliers. Therefore, there exists a conflict in a supply chain. That is, suppliers pass on the greenhouse gas emissions to the manufacturer to avoid the environmental cost. To study the coordination behaviors in a supply chain from sustainable perspective, this research focuses on how a manufacturer can adopt reasonable procurement strategies under the carbon emission regulations to achieve simultaneously the goals of profit maximization and pollution minimization. Three specific topics on green procurement are studied. In the first topic, the competition between two independent manufacturers is analyzed under two types of carbon emission regulations. Several boundary conditions are derived to assist the manufacturer to make the optimal procurement decision. In addition, how to select appropriate locations for the manufacturer to set up factories are analyzed by comparison of the influences of carbon emission regulations. With respect to the asymmetric information of suppliers, the second topic firstly focuses on the procurement contract design issue between a manufacturer and a single supplier. The green degree of a supplier is private and known only by the supplier itself. This factor predominately determines the emission volumes of the manufacturer. Under the emissions trading mechanism, the procurement contract between the profit-maximization manufacturer and the supplier is analyzed under different types of auctions, and a scenario of competitive procurement with multiple suppliers is discussed. From the dynamic viewpoint, the third topic aims to analyze the impact of carbon tax schemes on <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>issue</b> in a decentralized supply chain with a profit-maximization manufacturer and multiple suppliers. Two types of pricing strategies are derived respectively for both suppliers and the manufacturer. In addition, to observe a more general outcome, the scenario for the manufacturer sourcing from an n-suppliers' oligopoly is studied. The comparative statics analysis is conducted for the pricing strategies under different situations and parameter settings. Regarding each specific model, research outcomes provide meaningful managerial implications for both manufacturers and suppliers. Manufacturers benefit from the findings by adopting flexible strategies (e. g., ordering strategy, contract design, pricing strategy) when they comply with different carbon emissions regulations. The suppliers can {{have a better understanding of}} methods for maintaining or increasing their market share and the mutual effects of the strategies on the manufacturer and suppliers.

40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) In February 1990 the State President of the Republic of South Africa unbanned the {{political}} organisations {{that were previously}} banned. This set the scene for full and free elections. It also brought new role players to the fore. Parastatal institutions, including Eskom, now faced the problem of having {{to adapt to the}} new environment. or face the possibility of serious intervention from a new Government. During 1990 Nedcor and Old Mutual formed a team of experts, including one specialist from Eskom, to seek alternative paths that South Africa may embark on in an attempt to foster an environment that would enhance the possibility of a successful transition to a democratic South Africa. The team produced a scenario, which became known as the "change of gears" scenario. One of the cornerstones of this scenario is a kick-start of the economy, inter alia through supplying with electricity those citizens who do not yet have access to electricity. With a view to this the Nedcor/Old Mutual scenario suggests an electrification rate of one million houses per annum. This figure was criticised because of the negative effect it would have on the balance ofpayments. The Nedcor/Old Mutual scenario was presented to many parties, including the Cabinet and the ANC Executive. Although criticism was expressed against this scenario, it served a meaningful purpose in that it {{was probably one of the}} impetuses for the ANC's national meeting on electrification and the creation of other scenarios, such as that of Van der Berg. as well as other studies such as this dissertation. This dissertation, comprises an environmental scan of the needs and wants of the parties affected by electricity and electrification. These parties were identified as: Eskom; the local authorities; the people who currently do not have access to electricity; the central government; the unbanned political parties; and the consumers ofelectricity. It has been ascertained that South Africa, in the form of Eskom, has an excess power generating capacity of approximately 25 percent; that 65 percent of the population does not have access to electricity; and that the price of electricity is low as compared to that ofthe rest ofthe world. It has also been established that in South Africa the percentage ofhouseholds (ii) electrified is approximately twice as high as that of any other country on the sub-continent. From this it was concluded that the issue of electrification is a political one, nevertheless an opportunity to improve the economy. The views of the interest groups were studied, with particular emphasis on the views expressed at the ANC's first national meeting on electrification. The views of the parties were reduced to a list of sixteen requirements/expectations. These were divided into two groups, these on which there are a high degree of consensus and those on which agreement would have to be obtained. The latter included <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>issue</b> for prepaid meter customers versus the other small power users; the effect of poor load distribution on the price paid by black local authorities; the gross underutilisation ofmanpower in the industry, due to the fragmented structures; the redistribution of wealth; strong Government intervention; and the question of the level ofprofits in the industry. From this follows the recommendation that the electricity supply industry be onsolidated under the Eskom structure and that the issue around electrification be depoliticised. It is also recommended that a stable rate of electrification of approximately 250 000 houses per annum be maintained...|$|E
