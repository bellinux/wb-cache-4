40|$|Unit {{tests are}} {{primarily}} written {{as a good}} practice to support software evolution, i. e., to help developers to identify and fix bugs, to refactor code and to serve as documentation for a unit of software under test. To achieve these benefits, unit tests ideally should cover all possible paths in a program. One unit test usually covers one specific path in one function or <b>method.</b> However, a <b>test</b> <b>method</b> is not necessary an encapsulated, independent entity. Often a <b>test</b> <b>method’s</b> coverage is a superset of another <b>test</b> <b>method’s</b> coverage set and thus defects are not well isolated, i. e., one defect causes multiple <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> to fail. In this work we present an approach to automatically migrate JUNIT test classes to JEXAMPLE. JEXAMPLE allows <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> to declare explicit dependencies to other <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> and therefore improves defect isolation. With dynamic analysis we recover the coverage set of each <b>test</b> <b>method</b> and by partially ordering the <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> by means of their coverage sets we derive implicit dependencies between <b>test</b> <b>methods.</b> With program transformation we rewrite the original JUNIT test classes as test classes with explicit dependencies between <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> that can be executed with JEXAMPLE.

25|$|These {{days there}} is not much disputing that Ixodes holocyclus is the main vector for Rickettsial Spotted Fever (also known as Queensland tick typhus) (causative {{organism}} the bacteria Rickettsia australis) and Flinders Island Spotted Fever (causative organism Rickettsia honei). Rickettsia australis is an obligate, intracellular bacterial parasite that proliferates within the endothelial cells of small blood vessels, causing a vasculitis. Spotted Fever is probably more common than the Lyme-like Disease. Sometimes infection with Rickettsia australis occurs without a rash - there may just be a high fever. Usually (65% of cases) there is a black spot (known as an eschar, usually 2–5mm in diameter) {{at the site of the}} tick bite. This looks like a scab with redness and swelling around it. Usually there is only one eschar unless there has been more than one tick bite. Often lymph glands nearby are enlarged and painful. Fever starts 1–14 days (usually 7–10 days) following the tick bite, followed within a few days by a rash. The rash can look like chicken pox as the spots may contain some fluid. Other symptoms include headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, mental confusion, aching muscles and joints. The illness may be more severe in adults and elderly persons. Spotted Fever is diagnosed by two blood tests (IgM and Weil-Felix tests) taken 10 days apart. PCR analysis of skin biopsies is a more recent <b>testing</b> <b>method.</b> The disease runs its course in two weeks or so but can be cured more quickly with antibiotics (tetracyclines). As antibiotic treatment is very effective, many persons feel so well that they do not return to have the second blood sample collected. But this second blood test is important as it is the only way of proving the diagnosis of Spotted Fever. Spotted Fever rarely, if ever, occurs more than once because the body usually becomes immune for life. In rare instances there may be an apparent repeated infection after recovery - it is not known whether this is caused by another strain. It is also presently unknown if chronic infections occur. It is rarely fatal. Australian Spotted Fever was first described in 1946 when 12 soldiers contracted the disease during training exercises in north Queensland - it was at that time known as Queensland Tick Typhus (QTT). Infections generally arise in rural areas, but 10% of reported cases appear to have been acquired in major cities. It is apparently commonly seen in tick collectors in southern Queensland. It mostly occurs during the winter and spring, but can occur at any time in temperate areas.|$|E

RESULTS: The alkali-silica reactivity for those aggregates was verified by chemical test of KS F 2546 and accelerated mortar-bar test of ASTM C 1260. However, it was not by mortar-bar test of KS F 2546 and concrete prism test of ASTM C 1293.

The results from 3 types of <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> using cement-aggregate combinations appeared to be different. Because the environmental conditions of <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> for measuring the alkali-silica reactivity such as equivalent alkali content(external source), humidity, temperature, and times were different though the aggregates were same.
