Both AAP and ACMG discourage the use of direct-to-consumer and home kit genetic because of the accuracy, interpretation and oversight of test content. Guidelines also state that if parents or guardians should be encouraged to inform their child of the results from the genetic test if the minor is of appropriate age. If minor is of mature appropriate age and request results, the request should be honored. Though for ethical and legal reasons health care providers should be cautions in providing minors with predictive genetic testing without the involvement of parents or guardians. Within the guidelines AAP and ACMG state that health care provider have an obligation to inform parents or guardians on the implication of test results. To encourage patients and families to share information and even offer help in explain results to extend family or refer them to genetic counseling. AAP and ACMG state any type of predictive genetic testing for all types is best offer with genetic counseling being offer by Clinical genetics, genetic counselors or health care providers.|$|E

The overused urea in agricultural fields may affect the soil organisms especially, the earthworms which are known well for their role in soil fertility.

An acute toxicity test of urea to earthworm (Eisenia fetida) was performed using a simple paper contact method proposed by OECD (Organization for Economical Cooperation and Development) <b>testing</b> <b>guideline</b> no. 207. This is a simple screening test to identify the toxic potential of the chemical to earthworm. The lethal concentration was recorded as 28 µg/cm 2. Based on the resulting LC 50 value, urea was categorized as “very toxic ” to earthworm according to Roberts and Dorough (1984). The result of this study demonstrates that inorganic fertilizers can also be toxic to earthworms when contacted directly. Thus there arises an unavoidable need for monitoring the usage of fertilizer dosage on agricultural lands, particularly the urea...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} have been raised about the use of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Developmental Neurotoxicity <b>Testing</b> <b>Guideline</b> (DNTG) in the hazard identification of chemicals. The applicability and sensitivity of animal tests in the DNTG relative to human developmental neurotoxicity have recently been questioned. In a workshop held in 1989, participants compared the effects of several known developmental neurotoxicants in humans and animal models and concluded that the DNTG would have detected known human developmental neurotoxicants. They also concluded that although procedural differences may differ in the testing of humans and animals, the neurobiologic functions (ie, autonomic, sensory, motor, and cognitive) affected by chemical exposure were similar. In cases where the DNTG has been compared with other measures of reproductive and developmental toxicity, the DNTG has been relatively sensitive and specific. To date, DNTGs have been required 12 times, for 9 pesticides and 3 solvents. The sensitivity of the measures in the DNTG relative to other measures of developmental and adult toxicity supports the continued use of the DNTG in risk assessment...|$|E

For decades, many researchers have tried to find a good way for more effective testing. We are also studying about fault localization via various method. Especially, we perform an empirical evaluation for existing 32 algorithms that are prominent in the domain of spectrum-based fault localization. Through the evaluation, we analyze them with some properties such as accuracy, and categorize them with a clustering method. Based on the analysis result, we suggest new formulas, and technique of test case optimization. These formulas, named SEM(Sungkyunkwan Enhanced Method), can cover the weakness of each catego-rized group, and test case optimization method can maximize performance using minimum test cases. These two methods individually out-performs previously proposed methods. When both methods are used together, the performance is maximized with respect to accuracy, and cost.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{method for}} the assessment of acute dermal toxicity (OECD Test Guideline 402, 1987) uses death of animals as an endpoint to identify the median lethal dose (LD 50). A new OECD <b>Testing</b> <b>Guideline</b> called the dermal fixed dose procedure (dermal FDP) is being prepared to provide an alternative to Test Guideline 402. In contrast to Test Guideline 402, the dermal FDP does not provide a point estimate of the LD 50, but aims to identify that dose of the substance under investigation that causes clear signs of nonlethal toxicity. This is then used to assign classification according to the new Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling scheme (GHS). The dermal FDP has been validated using statistical modelling rather than by in vivo testing. The statistical modelling approach enables calculation of the probability of each GHS classification and the expected numbers of deaths and animals used in the test for imaginary substances with a range of LD 50 values and dose-response curve slopes. This paper describes the dermal FDP and reports the results from the statistical evaluation. It is shown that the procedure will be completed with considerably less death and suffering than guideline 402, and will classify substances either in the same or a more stringent GHS class than that assigned {{on the basis of the}} LD 50 value...|$|E

In an earlier paper the uniform procedure according to the BAM guideline for determining long-term water flow capacity was described, and the structural stability of drain cores under creep was investigated. The extrapolation of creep curves is permissible only when it can be shown, over the extrapolated period (at least 100 years), that oxidative aging does not invoke any relevant changes in the polyolefin material. This can be shown by measuring antioxidant depletion and mechanical degradation of the drain cores and filter/protection geotextiles in oven aging and water immersion tests.

Degradation of the tensile strength of HALS-stabilized polypropylene needle-punched nonwoven geotextiles (PP NWGTs) starts {{right from the beginning}} of the oven aging. This has to be taken into account for lifetime predictions based on residual tensile strength. The rate of oxidative degradation of NWGTs decreases significantly with increasing mass per area. Therefore the expected service life sets a limit on acceptable geotextile grammage. Antioxidant depletion in the drain cores, which are made of relatively thick PP strands or HDPE ribs, is about an order of magnitude slower than in filter and protection NWGTs, which are made of thin fibers.

A systematic review of published data on testing levels following publication of 2008 guidelines was undertaken. Medline, Embase and conference abstracts were searched according to a predefined protocol. We included studies reporting the number of HIV tests administered in those eligible for guideline recommended testing. We excluded reports of testing in settings with established testing surveillance (GUM/SH and antenatal clinics). A random effects meta-analysis was carried out to summarise level of HIV testing across the studies identified. Thirty studies were identified, most of which were retrospective studies or audits of testing practice. Results were heterogeneous. The overall pooled estimate of HIV test coverage was 27. 2 % (95 % CI 22. 4 % to 32 %). Test coverage was marginally higher in patients tested in settings where routine testing is recommended (29. 5 %) than in those with clinical indicator diseases (22. 4 %). Provider test offer was found to be lower (40. 4 %) than patient acceptance of testing (71. 5 %). Adherence to 2008 national guidelines for HIV testing in the UK is poor outside of GUM/SH and antenatal clinics. Low levels of provider test offer appear to be a major contributor to this. Failure to adhere to testing guidelines is likely to be contributing to late diagnosis with implications for poorer clinical outcomes and continued onwards transmission of HIV.

The Endocrine Disrupter Screening Program of US EPA has recently developed a Tier 2 <b>testing</b> <b>guideline</b> using model amphibian species Xenopus laevis. The Larval Amphibian Growth and Development Assay assesses a chemical's endocrine-related effects in vivo and generates concentration-response information for ecological risk-assessment. Currently, the assay relies on histopathological evaluations for identifying endocrine-related reproductive effects. However, histopathology can seldom define the chemical {{mode of action}} and is not easily interpreted {{in the context of}} risk assessment when the effects are minimal to moderate. This study explores the use of gene expression biomarkers in the gonad that could potentially inform a chemical's mode of action and detect adverse reproductive effects that are otherwise uncharacterized by histopathology. To identify candidate biomarkers, global expression was analyzed in differentiating ovary and testis tissues of Xenopus tropicalis. Genetic programs responsible for reproductive maturation in gonad tissues were characterized and provided a foundation from which specific genes could be selected proximal to a model chemical's known mode of action. Four genes were selected within the putative androgen molecular network to evaluate as biomarkers of the anti-androgen mode of action characteristic of a common fungicide, prochloraz. Following continuous exposure to prochloraz throughout embryonic, larval and juvenile development in Xenopus laevis, assessments of growth, liver and kidney pathology, and reproductive development were made. To evaluate the predictive capabilities of the candidate genes, one gonad was kept in situ for histopathological evaluations while the other was processed for mRNA analyses. Results indicate that prochloraz exposure caused metabolic toxicity in the liver and kidney; it caused testis degeneration coincident with the onset of androgen-mediated spermatogenesis and inhibited regression of Müllerian ducts. Two of the four candidate genes showed increases in expression at the high test concentration and appeared to be predictive of an anti-androgen-induced adaptive response. The behavior of these biomarkers stimulated valuable discussion and generated testable hypotheses to better understand the evolution of molecular mechanisms driving gonad development in a cross-species context. This study provides a model for expression-based biomarker development in endocrine tissues and offers direction toward enhanced ecological risk-assessment...|$|E
40|$|Ross HM Hatley, Sarah M Byrne Respironics Respiratory Drug Delivery (UK) Ltd, a {{business}} of Philips Electronics UK Limited, Chichester, UK Background: To improve convenience to patients, {{there have been}} advances {{in the operation of}} nebulizers, resulting in fast treatment times and less drug lost to the environment. However, limited {{attention has been paid to}} the effects of these developments on the delivered dose (DD) and respirable delivered dose (RDD). Published pharmacopoeia and ISO testing guidelines for adult-use testing utilize a single breathing pattern, which may not be sufficient to enable effective comparisons between the devices. Materials and methods: The DD of 5 mg of salbutamol sulfate into adult breathing patterns with inhalation:exhalation (I:E) ratios between 1 : 1 and 1 : 4 was determined. Droplet size was determined by laser diffraction and RDD calculated. Nine different nebulizer brands with different modes of operation (conventional, venturi, breath-enhanced, mesh, and breath-activated) were tested. Results: Between the non-breath-activated nebulizers, a 2. 5 -fold difference in DD (~ 750 – 1, 900 µg salbutamol) was found; with RDD, there was a more than fourfold difference (~ 210 – 980 µg). With increasing time spent on exhalation, there were progressive reductions in DD and RDD, with the RDD at an I:E ratio of 1 : 4 being as little as 40 % of the dose with the 1 : 1 I:E ratio. The DD and RDD from the breath-activated mesh nebulizer were independent of the I:E ratio, and for the breath-activated jet nebulizer, there was less than 20 % change in RDD between the I:E ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 4. Conclusion: Comparing nebulizers using the I:E ratio recommended in the guidelines does not predict relative performance between the devices at other ratios. There was significant variance in DD or RDD between different brands of non-breath-activated nebulizer. In future, consideration should be given to revision of the test protocols included in the guidelines, to reflect more accurately the potential therapeutic dose that is delivered to a realistic spectrum of breathing patterns.
