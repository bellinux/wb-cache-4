25|$|Stravinsky {{struggled}} financially {{during this}} period. Russia (and its successor, the USSR) did not {{adhere to the}} Berne Convention and this created problems for Stravinsky when collecting royalties for the performances of all his Ballets Russes compositions. Stravinsky blamed Diaghilev for his financial troubles, accusing him of failing {{to live up to}} the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> they had signed. He approached the Swiss philanthropist Werner Reinhart for financial assistance while he was writing L'Histoire du soldat (The Soldier's Tale). Reinhart sponsored and largely underwrote its first performance, conducted by Ernest Ansermet on 28 September 1918 at the Théâtre Municipal de Lausanne. In gratitude, Stravinsky dedicated the work to Reinhart and gave him the original manuscript. Reinhart supported Stravinsky further when he funded a series of concerts of his chamber music in 1919: included was a suite from Histoire du soldat arranged for violin, piano and clarinet, which was first performed on 8 November 1919, in Lausanne. In gratitude to his benefactor, Stravinsky also dedicated his Three Pieces for Clarinet (October–November 1918) to Reinhart, who was an excellent amateur clarinetist.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{doctrine of}} privity {{consisted of two}} rules - first, that a third party may not have obligations imposed by the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract,</b> and second, that a third party may not benefit from the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract.</b> The first rule {{is not something that}} is contested, while the second was described as [...] "one of the most universally disliked and criticised blots on the legal landscape". The second rule was not originally held to be valid, and in the 17th Century third parties were allowed to enforce <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> that benefited them, as shown in Provender v Wood [...] Hetley 30, where the judgement stated that [...] "the party to whom the benefit of a promise accrews, may bring his action." [...] The first reversal of this was in Bourne v Mason [...] 1 Vent., where the Court of King's Bench found that a third party had no rights to enforce a contract that benefited him. This case was quickly reversed, and decisions immediately after Bourne v Mason took the view that third parties could enforce contracts that benefited them.|$|E
500|$|Privity is a {{doctrine}} in English contract law {{that covers the}} relationship between parties to a contract and other parties or agents. At its most basic level, the rule is that a contract can neither give rights to, nor impose obligations on, anyone {{who is not a}} party to the original agreement, i.e. a [...] "third party". Historically, third parties could enforce the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract,</b> as evidenced in Provender v Wood, but the law changed in a series of cases in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the most well known of which are Tweddle v Atkinson in 1861 and Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre v Selfridge and Co Ltd in 1915.|$|E

500|$|The {{doctrine}} of privity was significantly reformed by the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, which received the Royal Assent on 11 November 1999 and [...] "thereby [...] {{one of the}} most universally disliked and criticised blots on the legal landscape". The first proposal to reform the {{doctrine of}} privity was made in 1937 by the Law Revision Committee in its Sixth Interim Report, which proposed an act of Parliament to allow third parties to enforce <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> that specifically allowed them to do so. The report was not acted on - as late as 1986 the assumption was that Parliament would not act, and any reform would come from judicial sources (particularly the House of Lords).|$|E
500|$|The {{doctrine}} {{was widely}} seen as unfair, for various reasons - it made no exception for cases where the parties to a contract obviously intended {{for it to be}} enforced by a third party, and it was so inconsistently applied that it provided no solid rule and was therefore [...] "bad" [...] law. The doctrine attracted criticism from figures such as Lord Scarman, Lord Denning, Lord Reid and Arthur Linton Corbin, and as early as 1937 the Law Revision Committee recommended that it should be significantly altered. With the passing of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 on 11 November 1999 the doctrine was significantly altered, and it now allows a third party to enforce the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> if the third party is specifically authorised to do so by the contract or if the contractual terms [...] "purport to confer a benefit" [...] on such third party.|$|E
500|$|Section 1 of the Act {{allows a}} third party to enforce <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> {{in one of two}} situations: firstly if he is {{specifically}} mentioned in the contract as someone authorised to do so, and secondly if the contract [...] "purports to confer a benefit" [...] on him. An exception to the second rule is if the contract makes it clear that the third party is not meant to be able to enforce the term. In Nisshin Shipping Co Ltd v Cleaves & Co Ltd [...] EWHC 2602 the High Court decided that in situations where there are questions over whether or not the second rule has been disapplied by a statement in the contract, the onus is on the party claiming that it has been disapplied. In the same decision the court decided that simply arranging an alternative way of enforcing the terms does not indicate that the 1999 Act was not meant to be used.|$|E

500|$|Following the broadcast, the IOC {{provisionally}} suspended Ivan Slavkov and forbade {{him from}} attending the 2004 Summer Olympics. Jacques Rogge {{claimed he was}} [...] "an angry man because some people are not playing by the rules," [...] underlining that [...] "Under my leadership, I can stress there is zero tolerance for unethical behaviour". An IOC Ethics Commission report released on 25 October 2004 condemned Slavkov and backed the veracity of the BBC's investigation: [...] "the complete recording of the meeting between Mr Slavkov and the two journalists reveals that: ...at no time and in no way did Mr Slavkov object to this discussion of the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> to secure a candidate city the votes of IOC members whom he and Mr Takac {{were likely to be}} able to influence". Knowing about the accusation, Slavkov argued that he attended the meeting with the purpose of trying to frame the supposed corrupters, however the Ethics Commission report further stated that [...] "at no point does it emerge from the meeting that Mr Slavkov's sole intention was to catch in the act these corrupters of IOC members." [...] It goes on to say that Slavkov received [...] "no mandate to 'find the real roots of corruption'" [...] and that he was to profit monetarily from Takac's services. The report concluded: ...|$|E

For the reason of Brown not returning to the role, the actress said: [...] "I had a bad accident last year, and when they wanted me back in November, I really couldn't go at that time, and that's why I came back looking like somebody else." [...] Stafford only portrayed the role for two months until February 9, 2007, when Sheila was shot by her longtime enemy Lauren Fenmore and presumed dead.|$|E

2500|$|The {{promises}} {{offered by}} {{one person to}} another are the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract,</b> but not every representation before an acceptance will always count as a term. The basic rule of construction is that a representation is a term if it looked like it was [...] "intended" [...] to be from the viewpoint of a reasonable person. It matters how much importance is attached to the term by the parties themselves, but also as a way to protect parties of lesser means, the courts added that someone who is in a more knowledgeable position {{will be more likely to}} be taken to have made a promise, rather than a mere representation. In Oscar Chess Ltd v Williams Mr Williams sold a Morris car to a second hand dealer and wrongly (but in good faith, relying on a forged log-book) said it was a 1948 model when it was really from 1937. The Court of Appeal held that the car dealer could not later claim breach of contract because they were in a better position to know the model. By contrast, in Dick Bentley Productions Ltd v Harold Smith (Motors) Ltd the Court of Appeal held that when a car dealer sold a Bentley to a customer, mistakenly stating it had done 20,000 miles when the true figure was 100,000 miles, this was intended to become a term because the car dealer was in a better position to know. A misrepresentation may also generate the right to cancel (or [...] "rescind") the contract and claim damages for [...] "reliance" [...] losses (as if the statement had not been made, and so to get one's money back). But if the representation is also a contract term a claimant may also get damages reflecting [...] "expected" [...] profits (as if the contract were performed as promised), though often the two measures coincide.|$|E
2500|$|Part of {{the process}} of {{construction}} includes the courts and statute implying terms into agreements. Courts imply terms, as a general rule, when the express <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> leave a gap to be filled. Given their basic attachment to contractual freedom, the courts are reluctant to override express terms for contracting parties. Legislation can also be a source of implied terms, and may be overridden by agreement of the parties, or have a compulsory character. For contracts in general, individualised terms are implied (terms [...] "implied in fact") to reflect the [...] "reasonable expectations of the parties", and like the process of interpretation, implication of a term of a commercial contract must follow from its commercial setting. In Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman the House of Lords held (in a notorious decision) that [...] "guaranteed annuity rate" [...] policy holders of the life insurance company could not have their bonus rates lowered by the directors, when the company was in financial difficulty, if it would undermine all the policy holders' [...] "reasonable expectations". Lord Steyn said that a term should be implied in the policy contract that the directors' discretion was limited, as this term was [...] "strictly necessary... essential to give effect to the reasonable expectations of the parties". This objective, contextual formulation of the test for individualised implied terms represents a shift from the older and subjective formulation of the implied term test, asking like an [...] "officious bystander" [...] what the parties [...] "would have contracted for" [...] if they had applied their minds to a gap in the contract. In AG of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd, Lord Hoffmann in the Privy Council added that the process of implication is to be seen as part of the overall process of interpretation: designed to fulfill the reasonable expectations of the parties in their context. The custom of the trade may also be a source of an implied term, if it is [...] "certain, notorious, reasonable, recognised as legally binding and consistent with the express terms".|$|E
