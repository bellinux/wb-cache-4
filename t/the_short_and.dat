Starting with Mircea the Shepherd (15451559), the first prince placed on the throne by the sultan, the crown became negotiable, according to the largest tribute offered. Even Michael the Brave who in time would turn against the Ottomans ascended the throne {{with the support of}} some people who had influence with the Sublime Porte, among them Sir Edward Barton, the English ambassador to Istanbul.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocephalus (obstruction of {{the flow}} of {{cerebrospinal}} fluid) may complicate SAH in both <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> long term. It is detected on CT scanning, on which there is enlargement of the lateral ventricles. If the level of consciousness is decreased, drainage of the excess fluid is performed by therapeutic lumbar puncture, extraventricular drain (a temporary device inserted into one of the ventricles), or occasionally a permanent shunt. Relief of hydrocephalus can lead to an enormous improvement in a person's condition. Fluctuations in blood pressure and electrolyte imbalance, as well as pneumonia and cardiac decompensation occur in about half the hospitalized persons with SAH and may worsen prognosis. Seizures occur during the hospital stay in about a third of cases.|$|E
5|$|Located at the {{junction}} of two earlier tube railway schemes, the station was opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP). The station entrances and below ground circulation were largely reconstructed for the introduction of escalators {{and the opening of}} Central line platforms in 1933, making the station the only interchange between the lines. Before 1994, Holborn was the northern terminus of <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> little-frequented Piccadilly line branch to Aldwych and two platforms originally used for this service are disused. One of the disused platforms has been used for location filming when a London Underground station platform is needed.|$|E

5|$|Other {{rationales}} {{for the failure}} of the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis include considering the conditional bias to be an exogenous variable explained by a policy aimed at smoothing interest rates and stabilizing exchange rates, or considering that an economy allowing for discrete changes could facilitate excess returns in the forward market. Some researchers have contested empirical failures of the hypothesis and have sought to explain conflicting evidence as resulting from contaminated data and even inappropriate selections of the time length of forward contracts. Economists demonstrated that the forward rate could serve as a useful proxy for future spot exchange rates between currencies with liquidity premia that average out to zero during the onset of floating exchange rate regimes in the 1970s. Research examining the introduction of endogenous breaks to test the structural stability of cointegrated spot and forward exchange rate time series have found some evidence to support forward rate unbiasedness in both <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> long term.|$|E
5|$|Since many {{remains of}} each species of mammoth are known from several localities, it is {{possible}} to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus through morphological studies. Mammoth species can be identified from the number of enamel ridges (or lamellar plates) on their molars; primitive species had few ridges, and the number increased gradually as new species evolved to feed on more abrasive food items. The crowns of the teeth became deeper in height and the skulls became taller to accommodate this. At the same time, the skulls became shorter from front to back to minimise the weight of the head. <b>The</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> tall skulls of woolly and Columbian mammoths (Mammuthus columbi) are the culmination of this process.|$|E
5|$|The addax has 29 {{pairs of}} {{chromosomes}}. All chromosomes are acrocentric {{except for the}} first pair of autosomes, which are submetacentric. The X chromosome is {{the largest of the}} acrocentric chromosomes, and the Y chromosome is medium-sized. <b>The</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> long arms of the pair of submetacentric autosomes correspond respectively to the 27th and 1st chromosomes in cattle and goats. In a study, the banding patterns of chromosomes in addax were found to be similar to those in four other species of the subfamily Hippotraginae.|$|E

5|$|The {{coalition}} {{was successful}} in taking control of both houses of the legislature; with the Senate election to be held just over a week later, intense politicking took place. Some lawmakers went into hiding for fear they would be pressured by the other side. The coalition decided on McKisson as their candidate {{the day before the}} balloting began. Three Republican state representatives who had voted with the Democrats to organize the legislature switched sides and voted for Hanna, who triumphed with a bare majority in both <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> long term elections. Bribery was alleged; legislative leaders complained to the United States Senate, which took no action against Hanna. McKisson lost a re-election bid as mayor in 1899; Hanna remained a powerful figure in the Senate until his death in 1904.|$|E
5|$|The {{velvet belly}} is a robustly built shark with a {{moderately}} long, broad, flattened snout. The mouth has thin, smooth lips. The upper teeth are small, {{with a narrow}} central cusp and usually fewer than three pairs of lateral cusplets. The lower teeth are much larger, with a strongly slanted, blade-like cusp {{at the top and}} interlocking bases. The five pairs of gill slits are tiny, comparable in size to the spiracles. Both dorsal fins bear stout, grooved spines at the front, with the second much longer than the first and curved. The first dorsal fin originates behind <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> rounded pectoral fins; the second dorsal fin is twice the size of the first and originates behind the pelvic fins. The anal fin is absent. The tail is slender, leading to a long caudal fin with a small lower lobe and a low upper lobe with a prominent ventral notch near the tip.|$|E
5|$|The {{wings are}} brown, but lighter {{than those of}} M.mystacinus. The plagiopatagium (the portion of the wing between the last digit and the hindlegs) is {{attached}} to the fifth toe. The tail extends only about 1mm beyond the back margin of the uropatagium (the portion of the wing membrane between the hindlegs). The calcar, a cartilaginous spur supporting the uropatagium, is slender. With a width around 1.3mm, the penis is narrow, and it lacks a broadened tip (except in one Croatian specimen). The baculum (penis bone) is about 0.5mm long. <b>The</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> broad shape of this bone distinguishes M.alcathoe from M.brandtii as well as M.ikonnikovi.|$|E

5|$|A set of iron carpenter's tools {{from the}} 3rd-4th century, {{including}} a compass for marking circles, {{was found in}} Przywóz, Wieluń County, {{where there was a}} Przeworsk culture settlement and a 2nd/3rd century dynastic burial complex. The graves of Przeworsk men typically include substantial collections of arms, so that their warrior's battle equipment and its evolution are well known. Less wealthy warriors fought typically on foot, with spears (for close range combat) and javelins (for throwing), both with iron heads. The better off fighters used swords, first of the long Celtic kind, and then in the 1st and 2nd century AD of <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> broad, gladius Roman infantry type. Swords were kept in sheaths, some of which, depending on status, were very ornate. The long and narrow swords, better suited for horseback combat, became popular again in the 3rd century, but only the more wealthy warriors had horses, not to mention iron helmets or ring armor. Round wooden shields had iron umbos in the middle, usually with a thorn for piercing the enemy. There were no saddles, but the richest of horsemen used silver spurs and bronze bridles with chain reins. Numerous Przeworsk culture objects including spurs and a unique silver belt buckle were recovered at the Aleksandrowice, Kraków County settlement area; some relics there are dated possibly as late as {{the first half of the}} 6th century.|$|E
5|$|Oecomys sydandersoni is {{medium-sized}} for its genus, being larger than, for example, O.bicolor, but {{smaller than}} O.concolor and O.mamorae. Its short, soft, and fine fur is bright ochraceous brown to pale tawny on the upperparts, changing moderately abruptly into the generally gray underparts. The fur on the chin, throat, {{and part of}} the belly is entirely white. The head is more grayish {{than the rest of the}} upperparts and the eyelids are black. Short hairs thinly cover the external ears, which are brown to gray-brown in color. <b>The</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> broad hindfeet are dirty white and show some characters that are typical of the genus, including well-developed pads and tufts of hair on the digits and a long fifth digit. The tail is slightly longer than the head and body on average, but relatively short for the genus. It is uniformly brown, but with a somewhat paler portion below near its base. Sparsely haired, the tail ends in a rudimentary pencil. There is no evidence for sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|Park's plan paid dividends. Bf 110s from ZG 26 {{were soon}} {{discovered}} by No. 56 Squadron and quickly found themselves under attack. In <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> sharp engagement, ZG 26 lost five Bf 110s and another damaged to No. 56 Squadron. Worse was to follow when No. 54 and 501 engaged the Messerschmitts. ZG 26 lost a further two shot down and two damaged to No. 54 Squadron. None of the RAF Squadrons reported any losses in these engagements. The Geschwader lost other machines to No. 151 and No. 46 Squadrons who arrived {{to join the}} battle. According to one source, the total losses of ZG 26 amounted to 12 destroyed and seven damaged throughout the entire day. Another source gives a list of 15 Bf 110s written off; 13 destroyed, two written off and six damaged on 18 August 1940. Whatever the actual losses, The Hardest Day marked {{the start of a}} decline in Bf 110 operations. Production was not keeping pace with losses, and there simply were not enough aircraft to go around.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} the mutiny on French rule was minimal, in <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> long term. The {{military}} casualties inflicted on the French army in the attack were in single figures and the attack did not generate widespread awareness among the populace, as the intended popular uprising did not occur. Instead, the attack backfired and saw {{a large number of}} VNQDĐ members killed, captured or executed. The subsequent French military and civilian crackdown saw military security increase and the VNQDĐ's ability to threaten French authority in Vietnam was extinguished. The vast majority of the leadership were killed or sentenced to death, and the remnants of the VNQDĐ fled to China, where several factions emerged under disparate leadership. In the long run, Yen Bay allowed the Indochinese Communist Party of Ho Chi Minh to inherit the VNQDĐ's status as the leading anti-colonial revolutionary movement. After the Second World War, an opportunity to fight for Vietnamese independence arose, and this allowed the communists in the Viet Minh to dictate the platform of the independence movement. As a result, the communists were able to position themselves to become the dominant force in Vietnam post-independence.|$|E
