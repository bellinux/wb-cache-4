5|$|And, {{at the end}} of the day, that's {{one thing}} we can't get past—serious BlackBerry enthusiasts will tell you that the {{interface}} is doing just fine, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of reasons to get hooked on these devices. For us, however, the BlackBerry UI is showing its age, and ultimately, beautiful hardware aside, this device is essentially exactly the same as every other BlackBerry.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of {{opportunities}} in the county for hiking, observing wildlife and admiring the scenery. These include Brechfa Forest, the Pembrey Country Park, the Millennium Coastal Park at Llanelli, the WWT Llanelli Wetlands Centre and the Carmel National Nature Reserve. There are large stretches of golden sands and the Wales Coast Path now provides a continuous walking route around the whole of Wales.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{writing was}} retraced by a later scribe (usually dated to the 10th or 11th century), {{and the beauty}} of the original script was spoiled. Accents and breathing marks, as well as punctuation, have been added by a later hand. There are no enlarged initials, no divisions into chapters or sections such as are found in later manuscripts, but a different system of division peculiar to this manuscript. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of the itacistic faults, especially the exchange of ει for ι and αι for ε. The exchange of ει and ο for ω is less frequent.|$|E
5000|$|The {{voluntary}} {{nature of}} the rural collectivization varied from region to region. According to Ralph Bates: [...] "While <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> of abuses, forced collectivization, etc., <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> of good collectives, i.e., voluntary ones." ...|$|R

60|$|But <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> of gas. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> no {{discernible}} {{reason why the}} car should not go. She started the engine. It ran for half a minute and quit. All the plugs showed sparks. No wires were detached in the distributor. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> of water, and the oil was not clogged. And that ended Claire's knowledge of {{the inside of a}} motor.|$|R
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the kakapo's {{breeding}} system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female who eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female kakapo will likely {{be able to produce}} eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty,</b> by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.|$|E

25|$|Not all beer in {{mainland}} Europe is pasteurised; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> {{of examples of}} unfiltered, unpasteurised beers, but these will commonly be served from a chilled container under pressure: a keg.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of {{food items}} that this dolphin feeds upon. They include fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods. During {{foraging}} periods, herds of about 7 dolphins will circle around prey and trap their victim. These prey entrapments occur slightly below the water surface level.|$|E

25|$|Not {{far away}} from the urban center, close to the city itself, and fully set in the {{municipality}} of Coimbra, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of mountain and river landscapes. These include the river beach of Palheiros do Zorro in the parish of Torres do Mondego.|$|E
25|$|The park {{boasts a}} variety of habitats, {{including}} both deciduous and coniferous woodlands, grassland and ponds. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of walks throughout the wooded areas of the park, an outdoor exercise area and a children's playground. There is a network of bridleways which cyclists and horseriders are welcome to use.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of maceiós {{and lakes}} {{in this part}} of Brazil; because of this, the city was named Maceió, and the State, Alagoas.

The city is home to the Federal University of Alagoas.|$|E

25|$|I {{think that}} Gould's {{separate}} compartments was a purely political ploy to win middle-of-the-road religious {{people to the}} science camp. But it's a very empty idea. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of places where religion does not keep off the scientific turf.

25|$|Health {{officials}} say <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> {{of problems in}} China's approach to AIDS. There are frequent reports of police crack-downs on local NGOs involved in AIDS prevention. There have also been reports of police using {{the presence of a}} condom in a sex worker's handbag to justify detention. This has been partially blamed on policy incoordination, and contradictions and conflicts between laws and regulations.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{concluded}} that they were most likely facing two perpetrators, who had meticulously planned the murders in advance, due to the difficulties a single perpetrator would face in controlling both girls. As he attacked one, the other would {{have an opportunity to}} escape. In Baneheia, people are always close by, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of hiding places among the pine thickets and rocks. The odds were good that a lone assailant would fail.|$|E

25|$|In the UK {{there are}} {{a high level of}} Japanese imports used within the {{drifting}} scene, {{due in part to the}} UK sharing a right-hand drive layout with Japan. However, these cars often cost more than UK-market cars, partly due to import costs. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of UK and European models used as drift cars as well, older BMW's are particularly prominent due to cost and availability, with Volvo 300 series and Ford Sierras also proving popular.|$|E
25|$|The {{league is}} {{continually}} {{on the lookout}} for college-quality baseball fields for each team to permanently call home. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> of fields that can host a weekend here or there, but very few have enough summer schedule flexibility to accommodate a 37-game season. Most college facilities have summer camps or youth tournaments that would conflict with LCBL games. One potential solution is {{the creation of a new}} baseball-only four-field complex in St. Louis, though no plans are currently in the works.|$|E

And to keep things interesting, the world of play is ever changing, as more areas to explore are unlocked and new treasures are discovered.|$|E
