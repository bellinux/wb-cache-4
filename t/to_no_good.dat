Although Alex is unable to convince the agents of what is happening they decide to let him go.

The bed scene was made up of thirty or so mattresses inside a tent of giant silk. The light was amazing, and once inside the bed set it felt so calming and peaceful. This serenity really reflects Pixie's performance in this section.|$|E

25|$|The {{counterpart}} to the slave was the dandy, a common {{character in the}} afterpiece. He was a northern urban black man trying to live above his station by mimicking white, upper-class speech and dress—usually <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>good</b> effect. Dandy characters often went by Zip Coon, after the song popularized by George Washington Dixon, although others had pretentious names like Count Julius Caesar Mars Napoleon Sinclair Brown. Their clothing was a ludicrous parody of upper-class dress: coats with tails and padded shoulders, white gloves, monocles, fake mustaches, and gaudy watch chains. They spent their time primping and preening, going to parties, dancing and strutting, and wooing women.|$|E
25|$|During 1985, Den and Angie {{celebrate}} their seventeenth wedding anniversary {{but it soon}} becomes clear that their marriage is a sham. Behind the scenes of their great business partnership, {{there is not much}} of a relationship going on. Den has a posh mistress Jan Hammond (Jane How), a fact that Angie is all too aware of. Early in the year, Den even manages to get on holiday to Spain with Jan, telling Angie that he is checking out a possible time-share holiday home purchase. With Den gone, Angie does what she always does in times of trouble, and turns to alcohol to drown her sorrows. She also sets about trying to seduce the men of Walford in a bid to get back at her philandering husband. Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt), Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) and even Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) are all subject to Angie's not-so-subtle flirting, but her only successful conquest is local builder, Tony Carpenter (Oscar James). Tony falls for Angie, but she is only using him to get back at Den. The affair is conducted in secret, but they are caught in a passionate clinch in the middle of The Queen Vic by Sharon. Angie has to bribe her daughter to ensure her silence, and even informs her about Den's infidelity. Sharon is disgusted that both her parents are guilty of adultery. Upon Den's return from his holiday, Angie calls off the affair, but it isn't long before Sharon gives Den the impression that her mother has been up <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>good.</b> Den confronts Angie, and she admits to the affair, but unfortunately for her, Den isn't concerned about her infidelity, more about his reputation, which upsets Angie even more.|$|E

500|$|However, {{the film}} was not without its detractors. Paul Attanasio of The Washington Post said [...] "the film showcases a visual stylist utterly in command of his talents" [...] and that Angelo Badalamenti [...] "contributes an {{extraordinary}} score, slipping seamlessly from slinky jazz to violin figures to the romantic sweep of a classic Hollywood score," [...] but stated that Lynch [...] "isn't interested in communicating, he's interested in parading his personality. The movie doesn't progress or deepen, it just gets weirder, and <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>good</b> end." [...] A general criticism from U.S. critics was Blue Velvets often vulgar approach to sexuality and violence. They asserted that this detracted from the film's seriousness {{as a work of}} art, and some condemned the film as pornographic. One of its detractors, Roger Ebert, praised Isabella Rossellini's performance as [...] "convincing and courageous" [...] but criticized how she was depicted in the film, even accusing David Lynch of misogyny: [...] "degraded, slapped around, humiliated and undressed in front of the camera. And when you ask an actress to endure those experiences, you should keep your side of the bargain by putting her in an important film." [...] While Ebert in later years came to consider Lynch a great filmmaker, his negative view of Blue Velvet remained unchanged after he revisited it in the 21st century.|$|E

You’re just not king of the music scene." [...] The [...] Jam! gives 3.5/5 stars to The Drug in Me Is You and said, [...] "In a world of poseurs, Ronnie Radke is the real deal.

500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times also was {{impressed}} with the cast's singing abilities, and praised the writers' risk-taking: [...] "that just goes to show how well thought out, creative, and just plain fun tonight’s “Fringe” really was. A lot of people would have pegged a 1940s film noir musical episode as a big risk, but the bigger the risk, the bigger the pay out". Rhee Dee of Pinkraygun.com commented [...] "After the revelation in the last episode, and Peter running away, this episode was a great way to express Walter’s grief and guilt about this whole situation without actually watching Walter talk about how sad and guilty he feels about everything. Walter’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for how he actually feels". Tim Grierson of New York Magazine thought the episode turned out to be simply mediocre because [...] "its noir elements weren’t incorporated in a really interesting way, and as for the musical numbers, they tended to be throwaway bits, save for “fictional” Dunham crooning “For Once in My Life” to the seemingly dying “fictional” Peter near the episode’s end". Grierson continued that [...] "If a show is going to completely throw away its usual rulebook for a fun onetime-only episode, {{it would be great if}} the writers could come up with a story as audacious as their premise. But aside from some Chinatown references, fancy threads, and mildly clever mirroring of the show’s mythology — Massive Dynamic is up <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>good</b> in this story-land world as well — 'Brown Betty' wasn’t all that enjoyable because it didn’t do a great job of capturing what generally makes Fringe enjoyable".|$|E

2500|$|After the {{shooting}} of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, Today ran a selectively edited version of the 9-1-1 call that George Zimmerman made prior to shooting and killing Martin (which he defended as being committed in self defense while standing trial for {{the shooting}}, {{for which he was}} acquitted on charges of murder in July 2013), which had the effect of making Zimmerman appear racist. In a March 2012 edition of the program, Today played a recording of Zimmerman saying, [...] "This guy looks like he's up <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>good.</b> He looks black." [...] However, several seconds of the call were cut from the 911 tape, removing Zimmerman's description of Martin, and a question asked to him about the teenager by the 911 operator.

In the edited recording, Zimmerman (who claimed he shot Martin in self defense; a grand jury later acquitted him on murder charges while on trial in August 2013) is heard saying, [...] "This guy looks like he's up <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>good.</b> He looks black." [...] A portion of the tape in which Zimmerman was describing Martin to the 911 operator was removed in its broadcast version; in the unedited version, Zimmerman said, [...] "This guy looks like he's up <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>good.</b> Or he's on drugs or something.

2500|$|Emperor Yuanzong was {{depressed}} {{over the military}} disasters. [...] Li Zhenggu suggested that he go into seclusion and entrust the state to Song. [...] Li Deming's friend Zhong Mo (鍾謨), who wanted to avenge Li Deming, used this opportunity to accuse Song, Li Zhenggu, and Chen of collaborating to have Song usurp the throne. [...] Further, at this time, Chen had also forged an order from Emperor Shizong (now formally Emperor Yuanzong's sovereign) that the Southern Tang chancellor Yan Xu be put to death. [...] These events convinced Emperor Yuanzong that the Song faction was up <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>good.</b> [...] In winter 958, Emperor Yuanzong thus acted, exiling Chen, executing Li Zhenggu, and ordering Song back into retirement at Mount Jiuhua, albeit with his titles still intact. [...] After Song reached Mount Jiuhua in spring 959, Emperor Yuanzong had his mansion securely guarded, only allowing food to be passed {{through a hole in}} the wall. [...] Song lamented and believed that this was divine retribution for his suggestion to have Yang Pu's family put under secure guard, and thereafter hanged himself.

2500|$|Another semi-negative {{response}} to the poem followed on 4 January 1808 in the Eclectic Review. The writer, James Montgomery, attacked the 1807 collection of poems for depicting low subjects. When {{it came to the}} ode, Montgomery attacked the poem for depicting pre-existence. After quoting the poem with extracts from the whole collection, he claimed, [...] "We need insist no more on the necessity of using, in poetry, a language different from and superior to 'the real language of men,' since Mr. Wordsworth himself is so frequently compelled to employ it, for the expression of thoughts which without it would be incommunicable. These volumes are distinguished by the same blemishes and beauties as were found in their predecessors, but in an inverse proportion: the defects of the poet, in this performance, being as much greater than his merits, as they were less in his former publication." [...] In his conclusion, Montgomery returned to the ode and claimed, that [...] "the reader is turned loose into a wilderness of sublimity, tenderness, bombast, and absurdity, to find out the subject as well as he can... After our preliminary remarks on Mr. Wordsworth's theory of poetical language, and the quotations which we have given from these and his earlier compositions, it will be unnecessary to offer any further estimate or character of his genius. We shall only add one remark.... Of the pieces now published he has said nothing: most of them seem to have been written for no purpose at all, and certainly <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>good</b> one." [...] In January 1815, Montgomery returned to Wordsworth's poetry in another review and argues, [...] "Mr. Wordsworth often speaks in ecstatic strains of the pleasure of infancy. If we rightly understand him, he conjectures that the soul comes immediately from a world of pure felicity, when it is born into this troublous scene of care and vicissitude... This brilliant allegory, (for such we must regard it,) is employed to illustrate the mournful truth, that looking back from middle age to the earliest period of remembrance we find, 'That there hath pass'd away a glory from the earth,'... Such is Life".|$|E
