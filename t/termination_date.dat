In June 2011, Square Enix announced that they would merge the account management portion of the PlayOnline service into Square Enix accounts from July 2011 and culminate on August 31, 2011. However, PlayOnline is still required in order to actually play Final Fantasy XI. Square Enix replicated the idea of the friends list from Final Fantasy XI in Final Fantasy XIV.

25|$|Even before 1 January 2000 arrived, {{there were}} also some worries about 9 September 1999 (albeit less than those {{generated}} by Y2K). Because this date could also be written in the numeric format 9/9/99, it could have conflicted with the date value 9999, frequently used to specify an unknown date. It was thus possible that database programs might act on the records containing unknown dates on that day. Data entry operators commonly entered 9999 into required fields for an unknown future date, (e.g., a <b>termination</b> <b>date</b> for cable television or telephone service), in order to process computer forms using CICS software. Somewhat similar to this is the end-of-file code 9999, used in older programming languages.

25|$|Magloire {{restored}} the elite to prominence. The {{business community and}} the government benefited from favorable economic conditions until Hurricane Hazel hit the island in 1954. Haiti made some improvements on its infrastructure, {{but most of these}} were financed largely by foreign loans. By Haitian standards, Magloire's rule was firm, but not harsh: he jailed political opponents, including Fignolé, and shut down their presses when their protests grew too strident, but he allowed labor unions to function, although they were not permitted to strike. It was in the arena of corruption, however, that Magloire overstepped traditional bounds. The president controlled the sisal, cement, and soap monopolies. He and other officials built imposing mansions. The injection of international hurricane relief funds into an already corrupt system boosted graft to levels that disillusioned all Haitians. To make matters worse, Magloire followed in the footsteps of many previous presidents by disputing the <b>termination</b> <b>date</b> of his stay in office. Politicians, labor leaders, and their followers flocked to the streets in May 1956 to protest Magloire's failure to step down. Although Magloire declared martial law, a general strike essentially shut down Port-au-Prince. Again like many before him, Magloire fled to Jamaica, leaving the army with the task of restoring order.|$|E

2500|$|Just {{prior to}} the {{entrance}} of the United States into World War II, the Revenue Act of 1941 was passed into law. In addition to increasing the rate on long distance calls, it also imposed the tax on “general” or local telephone service for the first time. The rate of tax for local telephone service was set at 6 percent of the amount paid by subscribers while that for long distance calls was set at 5 cents for each 50 cents or fraction thereof, if the cost of the message was greater than 24 cents. Other legislation was subsequently enacted during World War II — the Revenue Act of 1942 [...] and the Revenue Act of 1943. The tax rates on telephone service reached their all-time high under provisions of the Revenue Act of 1943. Rates were 15 percent on local telephone calls and 25 percent (on messages which cost more than 24 cents) on long distance calls. The Revenue Act of 1943 also provided for the increased excise tax rates to expire. In the case of the excise taxes on telephone service, the law provided that the increased rates would end six months after the “date of termination of hostilities in the present war.” The law defined the <b>termination</b> <b>date</b> as that date proclaimed by either the President or the date specified in a concurrent resolution of the two Houses of Congress, whichever is the earlier. In a reversal of this position, the Excise Tax Act of 1947 [...] continued the rates indefinitely.|$|E

40|$|Vicia villosa Roth, or hairy vetch, {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} cover crops (CC) in Mediterranean dry areas, with an interesting potential as dead mulch in no-tillage cropping systems. In low-input cropping systems, mechanical termination of hairy vetch could replace a glyphosate application to control weeds. Mechanical termination (e. g. with a roller crimper) of hairy vetch is ineffective until the late growing stages of vetch, leading to delayed sowing and yield reduction in the following crop. To find the best compromise in timing between effective termination of vetch and reasonable yield of no-till sunflower, an on-farm experiment was carried out in Pisa (Italy) in 2012 / 13 and 2013 / 14 to compare three termination techniques (roller crimper with no, half and full dose of glyphosate) and three <b>termination</b> <b>dates</b> (before flowering, beginning of flowering, 70...|$|R

Organic farmers need region-specific information on winter cover crop performance to effectively integrate cover crops into their crop rotations. Our research {{objective was to}} compare cover crop seeding mixtures, planting <b>dates,</b> and <b>termination</b> <b>dates</b> on performance of rye (Secale cereale L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) monocultures and mixtures in the maritime Pacific Northwest USA. The study included four seed mixtures (100 % hairy vetch, 25 % rye- 75 % hairy vetch, 50 % rye- 50 % hairy vetch, and 100 % rye by seed weight), two planting <b>dates,</b> and two <b>termination</b> <b>dates,</b> using a split-split plot design with four replications over six years. Measurements included winter ground cover; stand composition; cover crop biomass, N concentration, and N uptake; and June soil NO 3 (-) -N. Rye planted in mid-September and terminated in late April averaged 5. 1 Mg ha(- 1) biomass, whereas mixtures averaged 4. 1 Mg ha(- 1) and hairy vetch 2. 3 Mg ha(- 1). Delaying planting by 2. 5 weeks reduced average winter ground cover by 65 %, biomass by 50 %, and cover crop N accumulation by 40 %. Similar reductions in biomass and N accumulation occurred for late March termination, compared with late April termination. Mixtures had less annual biomass variability than rye. Mixtures accumulated 103 kg ha(- 1) N and had mean C:N ratio < 17 : 1 when planted in mid-September and terminated in late April. June soil NO 3 (-) -N (0 to 30 cm depth) averaged 62 kg ha(- 1) for rye, 97 kg ha(- 1) for the mixtures, and 119 kg ha(- 1) for hairy vetch. Weeds comprised less of the mixtures biomass (20 % weeds by weight at termination) compared with the monocultures (29 %). Cover crop mixtures provided a balance between biomass accumulation and N concentration, more consistent biomass over the six-year study, and were more effective at reducing winter weeds compared with monocultures...|$|R

40|$|Five {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine how nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) rate and fertilizer termination time, duration of N application, and cold duration and light intensity affect growth and flowering of Dendrobium nobile Red Emperor ?Prince?. The N, P, and K {{experiments were}} a factorial combination of five nutrient rates and three <b>termination</b> <b>dates</b> (1 Sept., 1 Oct., and 1 Nov. 2005). N and K rates were 0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg?L- 1. Phosphorus rates were 0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg?L- 1. For all nutrients, terminating fertilization on 1 Oct. or 1 Nov. resulted in thinner pseudobulbs. Pseudobulbs grew taller as N rate increased, peaking at 100 and 200 mg?L- 1. There were interactions between N rate and fertilizer termination time on all reproductive characteristics. For all fertilizer termination times, flower number increased once N was applied. When terminated on 1 Nov., 200 and 400 mg?L- 1 N caused a delay for the first flower to reach anthesis. Plants required more days to full flower when supplied with 200 mg?L- 1 N until 1 Oct. All P rates resulted in taller plants with equally more nodes compared to 0 mg?L- 1. For all three termination times, plants that were not supplied with P bloomed later than those receiving P. Plants produced the most flowers when P fertilization was terminated on 1 Oct. Plants required fewer days to reach full flower at the 1 Sept. P termination time. As K rate increased from 0 to 100 mg?L- 1, height increased, with no further increase at higher rates. Total flower number and flowering node number were the lowest at 0 mg?L- 1 K.

40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} investigates historical {{processes in}} Medieval Europe (using Spufford 2002, 2005 among other sources) {{in relation to}} (1) changing network configurations of trade and warfare, and (2) changes {{in the shape of}} city size hierarchies. This paper summarizes results in the form of general hypotheses consistent with findings from the Medieval period and begins to consider these hypotheses in the context of historical dynamics over the last two millennia. Each hypothesis is tested with available data at the largest scope and time depth available to this project. The most important results are that prior to Eurasian globalization, which begins in the second millennia, the sizes of trading networks oscillate slowly between more global expansions and more regionalized contractions. The timing of these long run oscillations tends to anticipate by 30 - 100 years the onset and <b>termination</b> <b>dates</b> of detrended rise and fall in regional population as posited by Turchin and Nefedov (2006) in their findings about regional secular cycles.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} the asymptotic {{theory of the}} ordinary least squares estimator of the autoregressive (AR) coefficient in various AR models, when data is generated from trend-stationary models in different forms. It is shown that, {{depending on how the}} autoregression is specified, the commonly used right-tailed unit root tests may tend to reject the null hypothesis of unit root in favor of the explosive alternative. A new procedure to implement the right-tailed unit root tests is proposed. It is shown that when the data generating process is trend-stationary, the test statistics based on the proposed procedure cannot find evidence of explosiveness. Whereas, when the data generating process is mildly explosive, the unit root tests find evidence of explosiveness. Hence, the proposed procedure enables robust bubble testing under deterministic trends. Empirical implementation of the proposed procedure using data from the stock and the real estate markets in the US reveals some interesting findings. While our proposed procedure flags the same number of bubbles episodes in the stock data as the method developed in Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015 a, PSY), the estimated <b>termination</b> <b>dates</b> by the proposed procedure match better with the data. For real estate data, all negative bubble episodes flagged by PSY are no longer regarded as bubbles by the proposed procedure...|$|R
