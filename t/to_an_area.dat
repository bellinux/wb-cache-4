Several bridges were destroyed along the Bash Bish Brook, and portions of U.S. Route 209 were flooded. Damage totaled $16.2million, {{and there was}} one death in the state.|$|E

Situated over exceedingly cold waters, Fran transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on October12 as it neared the French coastline.

After this point, the mixture is poured into a griddle, flipped to cook the other side, and then flipped onto a plate.|$|E

5|$|On August 25, Tropical Storm Chloe made {{landfall}} on British Honduras (present day Belize) as {{a tropical}} depression.

On August 28, the tropical activity organized around a circulation which quickly developed into a tropical depression the same day. The depression was upgraded to a tropical storm on August 29 based on satellite presentation that depicted significant cirrus outflow and a commashaped cloud mass spanning 2° of latitude in diameter and was subsequently named Lily.|$|E

5|$|The Highway70 {{designation}} {{was first}} used along the Heenan Highway, connecting the Rainy River region to Kenora to provide the first Canadian road link <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> previously accessible only from the United States. In 1922, Kenora MPP Peter Heenan and Dr. McTaggart approached the government to lobby for construction of a road between Nestor Falls and Kenora. Nestor Falls was the northernmost point accessible by road from the Rainy River area. Heenan would become the Minister of Lands and Forests in Mitch Hepburn's cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Traverse des Sioux in 1851 {{gave all}} of the Wahpeton and Sisseton Sioux (upper Sioux) lands west of the Mississippi River to the U.S. government. The Treaty of Mendota that same year ceded the Mdewakanton and Wahpekute Sioux (lower Sioux) lands in {{southern}} Minnesota, requiring relocation <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> near modern Morton. Both treaties, however, were amended to during the ratification process to eliminate the explicit guarantees of lands retained by the tribes. Additionally much of the promised payments were never delivered in part ostensibly because of debts owed by the Sioux to the fur traders.|$|E

This brought the issue of relocation back to light. Despite this, however, in 1997, Sde Dov was declared an International Airport for private flights. In the future, the Main Terminal, the aircraft parking aprons and the aircraft hangars will be transferred <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> near the Tel Baruch Beach which will enable {{the construction of new}} traffic routes to North Tel Aviv.|$|E
