500|$|Lee was a {{character}} actor and acting instructor {{with a range}} of roles in the theater and who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy era. [...] According to writer Michael Davis, Lee played Mr. Hooper, known for his bowtie and hornrimmed glasses, [...] "with such certainty and naturalness he made adults suspend their sense of disbelief". [...] Writer Louise A. Gikow stated that Lee was [...] "perfectly cast" [...] as Mr. Hooper. [...] According to fellow cast member Bob McGrath, who also appeared in Sesame Streets first episode with Lee, [...] "Will had a broader dimension to his character than perhaps the rest of us did... He convinced me that no matter how simple the scene was with a child, you had to bring a tremendous integrity and an honesty and credibility to it". [...] Joan Ganz Cooney, Sesame Street co-creator and president of the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), said, [...] "He gave millions of children the message that the old and the young have a lot <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other". [...] The New York Times reported that Mr. Hooper ranked first of all human characters of the show in recognition by young viewers.|$|E
500|$|The serial later {{played out}} another chance for Ivan and Paul to be together. While interviewed by Claire Brand from Inside Soap, Bose said that Paul visits Ivan {{to give him}} back a CD he left over his house and [...] "both of them realise that they don't have {{anything}} left <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other." [...] Bose opined that Ivan and Paul were [...] "doomed from the start" [...] because he needed Ivan to commit. Rodney thinks that he can reunite Paul and Ivan and sets the pair up. He explained that the two had [...] "just about got over their awkwardness with one another" [...] and Rodney tells the whole pub that {{it is obvious that}} Paul and Ivan love each other and need to reconcile. The whole situation is [...] "embarrassing for both of them" [...] and Ivan is furious with Rodney's intervention. After some [...] "soul searching", Ivan calms down and [...] "stuns" [...] Paul when he asks him to get back with him. Paul rejects Ivan's advances, Bose said that Paul normally likes [...] "the big love affair" [...] but this time gives him his [...] "marching orders". Ivan is left heartbroken once again and decides to take some time away from the village. Bose stated that his character goes to see him off and there is a [...] "terrible silent moment" [...] between the two. He concluded that the audience could clearly see that Ivan and Paul were [...] "kicking themselves" [...] for not saying how they really feel.|$|E

The duration of the measurements was 1–3 hours. In these circumstances, of the 52 measurements, in 2 cases, the workers had removed the mask (because they had something <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other) - and these results were not {{taken into account in}} the analysis. However, use of respirators intermittently drastically reduces their efficiency. This shows how important to correctly organize the use of respirators, and to provide workers with the intercom stations (if necessary).|$|E

2500|$|Hopper's Room in New York (1932) and Cape Cod Evening (1939) {{are prime}} {{examples}} of his [...] "couple" [...] paintings. In the first, {{a young couple}} appear alienated and uncommunicative—he reading the newspaper while she idles by the piano. The viewer takes {{on the role of}} a voyeur, as if looking with a telescope through the window of the apartment to spy on the couple's lack of intimacy. In the latter painting, an older couple with little <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, are playing with their dog, whose own attention is drawn away from his masters. Hopper takes the couple theme to a more ambitious level with Excursion into Philosophy [...] (1959). A middle-aged man sits dejectedly {{on the edge of a}} bed. Beside him lies an open book and a partially clad woman. A shaft of light illuminates the floor in front of him. Jo Hopper noted in their log book, [...] "he open book is Plato, reread too late".|$|E

5000|$|Set in Mumbai, {{the plot}} follows {{two young men}} who {{regularly}} take the same local train home. Both the men are quiet and shy, but dare to come close enough <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, but just can’t bring themselves to open their mouths.|$|R
60|$|Walter and Marian {{were not}} {{familiar}} enough <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, but both were comparing his present conduct {{with his former}} bitterness of spirit against his mother. Death, sorrow, anxiety, and illness had drawn close the cords of love, and opened the well-springs of affection, so long choked up and soured by neglect and worldly care.|$|R

You {{seem to have been}} there on purpose." [...] And in the same whisper, as if we two whenever we talked had <b>to</b> <b>say</b> things <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other which were not fit for the world to hear, he added, [...] "It's very wonderful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I'm pretty tired, and I {{should think}} you would be, too, poppa. I'll speak to poor Boyne. Don't mind Lottie. I suppose she couldn't help saying it." [...] She kissed her father, and slipped quietly into Boyne's room, from which they could hear her passing on to her own before they ventured <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other in the hopeful bewilderment to which she had left them.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] said Stobell, [...] "you and me {{have got}} {{a word or two}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other. I haven’t had the {{pleasure}} of seeing your ugly face since—" ...|$|E

5000|$|In the video, {{the band}} appears {{playing in a}} {{scenario}} they've never experienced before. A {{man and a woman}} are shown, trying <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other by the words of band's vocals José Madero (because the woman doesn't want to give an explanation but her [...] "heart" [...] just like the man, that's why they don't talk). José appears dressed as a Priest; however, in an interview from some awards, he said that it was just a design and not a costume. The video was directed by Rodrigo Guardiola, member of band Zoé.|$|R

In this way all members will live in peace. And we forbid anyone to embrace excessive abstinence; but firmly keep the communal life.|$|R
500|$|Later {{she drew}} a {{distinction}} between their methods, arguing that Quimby's involved one mind healing another, while hers depended on a connection with Divine Mind. In February 1883 Julius Dresser, a former patient of Quimby's, accused Eddy in letters to the Boston Post of teaching Quimby's work as her own. In response Eddy disparaged Quimby as a mesmerist and said she had experimented with mental healing in or around 1853, nine years before she met him. She wrote later: [...] "We caught some of his thoughts, and he caught some of ours; and both of us were pleased <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other." ...|$|R

The memorable and oft parodied scene culminates in an emotional huddle, during which nobody wants to let go, and, needing some tissues, the group shuffles en masse toward a box on Mary's desk. After final goodbyes, everyone exits the newsroom singing [...] "It's a Long Way to Tipperary". Finally, a very emotional Mary looks back, then bucks up and smiles before turning off the lights and closing the door.|$|R
