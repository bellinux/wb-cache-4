Air New Zealand has occasionally used wide body aircraft to cater for high-demand events such as major sports fixtures, and the airport has seen a number of wide-body movements over the years for heads of state and visiting foreign dignitaries, diversions or special promotional events.

2500|$|The social {{caterpillars}} of Malacosoma disstria are nomadic and forage as a group. The fifty to {{two hundred}} larvae {{that result from}} a single egg-mass live together {{for most of their}} larval stages. Trails of silk heavily loaded with pheromones secreted by other colony members induce larvae to move, while the close presence of other colony members brings them to [...] This indicates that there are social cues that are used to increase the locomotive efficiency of each individual larva. [...] Pupation occurs after caterpillars reach a size threshold that is attained more quickly when caterpillars forage in groups. This is particularly important since delayed development <b>to</b> <b>threshold</b> increases the risks of predation and food depletion. [...] However, as larvae proceed into the later instars, they become increasingly independent and by the fifth instar rarely form aggregations. This ontogenetic change in gregariousness results from an increase in the costs of maintaining grouping due to changes related to predation, thermoregulation, silk production, and foraging.|$|E

2500|$|Each excitable {{patch of}} {{membrane}} has two important levels of membrane potential: [...] the resting potential, {{which is the}} value the membrane potential maintains as long as nothing perturbs the cell, and a higher value called the threshold potential. [...] At the axon hillock of a typical neuron, the resting potential is around –70 millivolts (mV) and the threshold potential is around –55 mV. [...] Synaptic inputs to a neuron cause the membrane to depolarize or hyperpolarize; that is, they cause the membrane potential to rise or fall. [...] Action potentials are triggered when enough depolarization accumulates to bring the membrane potential up <b>to</b> <b>threshold.</b> [...] When an action potential is triggered, the membrane potential abruptly shoots upward and then equally abruptly shoots back downward, often ending below the resting level, where it remains for some period of time. [...] The shape of the action potential is stereotyped; that is, {{the rise and fall}} usually have approximately the same amplitude and time course for all action potentials in a given cell. [...] (Exceptions are discussed later in the article). [...] In most neurons, the entire process takes place in about a thousandth of a second. [...] Many types of neurons emit action potentials constantly at rates of up to 10–100 per second; some types, however, are much quieter, and may go for minutes or longer without emitting any action potentials.|$|E
