5|$|Alcohols do not {{normally}} behave as acids in water, but {{the presence of}} a double bond adjacent to the OH group can substantially decrease the pKa by the mechanism of keto–enol <b>tautomerism.</b> Ascorbic acid is an example of this effect. The diketone 2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone) is also a weak acid because of the keto–enol equilibrium. In aromatic compounds, such as phenol, which have an OH substituent, conjugation with the aromatic ring as a whole greatly increases the stability of the deprotonated form.|$|E
25|$|Valence <b>tautomerism</b> {{is a type}} of <b>tautomerism</b> {{in which}} single and/or double bonds are rapidly formed and ruptured, without {{migration}} of atoms or groups. It is distinct from prototropic <b>tautomerism,</b> and involves processes with rapid reorganisation of bonding electrons.|$|E

25|$|<b>Tautomerism</b> — A base {{is changed}} by the {{repositioning}} of a hydrogen atom, altering the hydrogen bonding pattern of that base, resulting in incorrect base pairing during replication.|$|E
25|$|The proton {{attached}} to the nitrogen can also move to the oxygen to give the second tautomer form, 2-hydroxypyridine. This lactam lactim <b>tautomerism</b> can also be exhibited in many related compounds.|$|E
25|$|Other {{examples}} {{of this type of}} <b>tautomerism</b> can be found in bullvalene, and in open and closed forms of certain heterocycles, such as organic azides and tetrazoles, or mesoionic münchnone and acylamino ketene.|$|E
25|$|Aldehydes (except {{those without}} an alpha carbon, or without protons on the alpha carbon, such as {{formaldehyde}} and benzaldehyde) can exist {{in either the}} keto or the enol tautomer. Keto-enol <b>tautomerism</b> is catalyzed by either acid or base. Usually the enol is the minority tautomer, {{but it is more}} reactive.|$|E
25|$|Phenol {{exhibits}} keto-enol <b>tautomerism</b> {{with its}} unstable keto tautomer cyclohexadienone, {{but only a}} tiny fraction of phenol exists as the keto form. The equilibrium constant for enolisation is approximately 10−13, meaning that only one in every ten trillion molecules is in the keto form at any moment. The small amount of stabilisation gained by exchanging a C=C bond for a C=O bond is more than offset by the large destabilisation resulting from the loss of aromaticity. Phenol therefore exists essentially entirely in the enol form.|$|E
25|$|Reticuline {{is known}} as the {{immediate}} precursor of protoberberine alkaloids in plants. Berberine is an alkaloid derived from tyrosine. L-DOPA and 4-hydroxypyruvic acid both come from L-tyrosine. Although two tyrosine molecules are used in the biosynthetic pathway, only the phenylethylamine fragment of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring system is formed via DOPA, the remaining carbon atoms come from tyrosine via 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. L-DOPA loses carbon dioxide to form dopamine 1. Likewise, 4-hydroxypyruvic acid also loses carbon dioxide to form 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde 2. Dopamine 1 then reacts with 4-hydroxy-phenylacetaldehyde 2 to form (S)-norcolaurine 3 in a reaction similar to the Mannich reaction. After oxidation and methylation by SAM, (S)-reticuline 4 is formed. (S)-reticuline serves as a pivotal intermediate to other alkaloids. Oxidation of the tertiary amine then occurs and an iminium ion is formed 5. In a Mannich-like reaction the ortho position to the phenol is nucleophilic, and electrons are pushed to form 6. Product 6 then undergoes keto-enol <b>tautomerism</b> to form (S)-scoulerine, which is then methylated by SAM to form (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine 7. Product 7 is then oxidized to form the methylenedioxy ring from the ortho-methoxyphenol, via an O2-, NADPH- and cytochrome P-450-dependent enzyme, giving (S)-canadine 8. (S)-canadine is then oxidized to give the quaternary isoquinolinium system of berberine. This happens in two separate oxidation steps, both requiring molecular oxygen, with H2O2 and H2O produced in the successive processes.|$|E
