5|$|Because {{ovulation}} is {{not always}} <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate. Furthermore, cats are superfecund; that is, a female may mate {{with more than one}} male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different fathers.|$|E
5|$|Guttate {{psoriasis}} {{is characterized}} by numerous small, scaly, red or pink, droplet-like lesions (papules). These numerous spots of psoriasis appear over {{large areas of the}} body, primarily the trunk, but also the limbs and scalp. Guttate psoriasis is often <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> streptococcal infection, typically streptococcal pharyngitis. The reverse is not true.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause is}} not {{completely}} understood, but involves a T cell-mediated immune response <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> variety of factors. Different individuals have different triggers, which may include nutritional deficiencies, local trauma, stress, hormonal influences, allergies, genetic predisposition or other factors.|$|E

5|$|While {{the cause}} is not clear, the {{underlying}} mechanism {{is thought to be}} either destruction by the immune system or failure of the myelin-producing cells. Proposed causes for this include genetics and environmental factors such as being <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> viral infection. MS is usually diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms and the results of supporting medical tests.|$|E
5|$|Another idea tied to 2012 {{involved}} a geomagnetic reversal (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a pole shift by proponents), possibly <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100billion atomic bombs. This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic field was weakening, which could precede a reversal of the north and south magnetic poles, and the arrival of the next solar maximum, which was expected sometime around 2012.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{was already}} {{working on a}} key {{component}} of the device. In April 1943, Robert Serber had proposed that instead of relying on spontaneous fission, the chain reaction inside the bomb should be <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> neutron initiator. The best-known neutron sources were radium-beryllium and polonium-beryllium. The later was chosen as it had a 140-day half life, which made it intense enough to be useful but long-lived enough to be stockpiled. Thomas brought in Monsanto to work on the development of techniques to industrially refine polonium for use with beryllium in the urchin detonators.|$|E

5|$|These growing {{tensions}} between Henry and Louis finally {{spilled over into}} open war in 1167, <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> trivial argument over how money destined for the Crusader states of the Levant should be collected. Louis allied himself with the Welsh, Scots and Bretons, and the French king attacked Normandy. Henry responded by attacking Chaumont-sur-Epte, where Louis kept his main military arsenal, burning the town {{to the ground and}} forcing Louis to abandon his allies and make a private truce. Henry was then free to move against the rebel barons in Brittany, where feelings about his seizure of the duchy were still running high.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{is prone}} to bouts of {{clinical}} depression, after a fainting spell (<b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> panic attack), Tony's physician refers him for treatment from psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), in the show's first episode. She treats Tony {{to the best of}} her ability {{despite the fact that they}} routinely clash over various issues. Melfi is usually thoughtful, rational and humane—a stark contrast to Tony's personality. Tony, a serial womanizer, occasionally divulges his sexual attraction to Dr. Melfi; Melfi harbors some degree of attraction to Tony, too, but never admits or acts on it. Melfi is far more attracted to Tony's dangerousness and power. She is drawn to the challenge of helping such an unusual client, and naively assumes that their doctor-patient relationship will not affect her personal life in any way.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{research}} {{has estimated that}} the quake was between 6.0 and 6.3 on the Richter scale, and the United States Geological Survey lists it as the largest earthquake {{in the history of}} Massachusetts. Scientists are unclear on the causes of this and other quakes in the northeastern United States. There are a number of old faults in the region, but none of them are known still to be active. It is possible that the Cape Ann earthquake may have been remotely <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> larger earthquake in Lisbon, Portugal, a few weeks prior, although there is not enough evidence to prove that they are linked.|$|E

5|$|Nocturne {{follows the}} Protagonist, {{a high school}} student in modern-day Tokyo, as he is {{transformed}} into a half-demon after the world undergoes Conception, an apocalyptic event <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> sinister cult to trigger the world's rebirth in a new form. With Tokyo transformed into a Vortex World filled with demons, the Protagonist becomes instrumental to the schemes of the Reasons, beings who seek to remake the world in their image, and Lucifer, the lord of demons. The gameplay uses a turn-based battle system based on exploiting weaknesses, and a Demon recruitment system allowing the player to recruit demons found in the Vortex World to fight alongside them.|$|E
5|$|One form {{of apple}} allergy, {{often found in}} {{northern}} Europe, is called birch-apple syndrome, and is found in people who are also allergic to birch pollen. Allergic reactions are <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> protein in apples {{that is similar to}} birch pollen, and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Reactions, which entail oral allergy syndrome (OAS), generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat, but in rare cases can also include life-threatening anaphylaxis. This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed—the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process. The variety of apple, maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits. Long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birch-apple syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Players are {{penalized for}} using certain vampiric {{abilities}} {{in front of}} witnesses; exposing their existence loses masquerade points, although additional masquerade points can be earned with quests and other actions. Violating the masquerade five times draws the ire of vampire hunters and loses the game. The player has humanity points, representing the vampire's humanity. Some actions cost humanity points; a low humanity score alters available dialog options to become more aggressive, and increases the chance of entering a frenzied state and embarking on a killing spree, when the vampire's blood is low. This frenzy can also be <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> large amount of damage. Like masquerade points, losing all humanity points ends the game, with the vampire becoming a mindless beast. Some areas, known as Elysium, prevent the use of Disciplines or weapons. Players can recruit a female ghoul, Heather, as a customizable servant who gives them blood, gifts, and money.|$|E

5|$|The Belgian 7th Infantry Division was {{assigned}} to guard the three bridges over the canal, supplementing the troops who garrisoned Fort Eben-Emael {{at the time of}} the battle. The defences for each bridge consisted of four large concrete pillboxes on the western side of the canal, three equipped with machine-guns and a fourth with an anti-tank gun; the bunker containing the anti-tank gun was positioned close to the road leading from the bridge, with one machinegun-equipped bunker immediately behind the bridge and two others flanking the bridge a short distance either side. A company position existed on the western bank of the canal by each of the bridges, with a small observation post on the eastern side, which could be quickly recalled, and all three bridges could be destroyed with demolition charges set into their structures, <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> firing mechanism situated in the anti-tank bunkers.|$|E
5|$|The {{announcement}} of the review {{appeared to have been}} <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> News International campaign, by way of one of its British tabloids, The Sun. On 11 May 2011, as it was serializing Kate McCann's book, Madeleine, The Suns front page hosted an open letter from the McCanns in which they asked Prime Minister David Cameron to set up a new inquiry; 20,000 people signed the newspaper's petition that day. On the same day, according to her testimony to the Leveson Inquiry, Theresa May spoke by telephone, at her instigation, to Rebekah Brooks, chief executive of News International, and Dominic Mohan, editor of The Sun. The next day she wrote to the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Paul Stephenson, to say that the Portuguese police had agreed to cooperate with a British inquiry. Within 24 hours, Cameron made the announcement about Operation Grange, to be financed by a Home Office contingency fund.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} dissipation of protoplanetary disks is <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} different mechanisms. The inner part of the disk is either accreted by the star or ejected by the bipolar jets, whereas the outer part can evaporate under the star's powerful UV radiation during the T Tauri stage or by nearby stars. The gas in the central part can either be accreted or ejected by the growing planets, while the small dust particles are ejected by the radiation pressure of the central star. What is finally left is either a planetary system, a remnant disk of dust without planets, or nothing, if planetesimals failed to form.|$|E
50|$|The {{premise of}} the antagonist's plot (conditioning horses with fire to suffer <b>a</b> panic attack <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> {{ultrasonic}} whistle) {{is exactly the same}} as that used in Dick Francis's 1965 novel For Kicks.|$|R
50|$|The 1976 {{election}} {{was the only}} post-war general election <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> expiration of the term of the House of Representatives; all other post-war elections have been instigated <b>by</b> <b>a</b> dissolution of the House by the Cabinet.|$|R
50|$|The APAV 40 is a dual purpose, anti-personnel (AP) and anti-vehicle (AV), 40 mm rifle-grenade. It has {{a mass of}} 405 grams, and a tail with {{stabilizing}} fins. Explosion is <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> impact fuse.|$|R
5|$|Occasionally, {{the player}} can find {{rustling}} patches {{of grass and}} rippling water, where they can encounter either a rare Pokémon, a Pokémon {{more common in the}} opposite game version, or the highest evolutionary form of a Pokémon whose lower forms can normally be found in the area. This {{is the only way to}} capture Pokémon such as Audino, Emolga, and Alomomola. Also, dust clouds in caves and the shadows of flying Pokémon on certain bridges can be entered to either find a rare item or encounter Drilbur, Excadrill, Ducklett, or Swanna, none of which can be found in the wild otherwise. Occasionally, when throwing a Poké Ball, the capture rate is highly increased, <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> random event. There are also new side-games and sidequests: the player can compete in Pokémon Musicals, a side-game similar to the Pokémon Contests of previous games; the Battle Subway, similar to the Battle Towers and Battle Frontiers of previous games; and on the Royal Unova, a cruise ship that the player can ride and fight Trainers aboard to win otherwise rare items.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 2013, NASA officially {{confirmed}} that Voyager 1 {{had reached the}} interstellar medium in August 2012 as previously observed, with a generally accepted date of August 25, 2012, the date durable changes in the density of energetic particles were first detected. By this point most space scientists had abandoned the hypothesis that a change in magnetic field direction must accompany crossing of the heliopause; {{a new model of}} the heliopause predicted that no such change would be found. A key finding that persuaded many scientists that the heliopause had been crossed was an indirect measurement of an 80-fold increase in electron density, based on the frequency of plasma oscillations observed beginning on April 9, 2013, <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> solar outburst that had occurred in March 2012 (electron density is expected to be two orders of magnitude higher outside the heliopause than within). Weaker sets of oscillations measured in October and November 2012 provided additional data. An indirect measurement was required because Voyager 1s plasma spectrometer had stopped working in 1980. In September 2013, NASA released audio renditions of these plasma waves. The recordings represent the first sounds to be captured in interstellar space.|$|E
5|$|The Met {{opened with}} no stock of its own, with the GWR {{and then the}} GNR {{providing}} services. The GWR used eight-wheeled compartment carriages constructed from teak. By 1864, the Met had taken delivery of its own stock, made by the Ashbury Railway Carriage & Iron Co., based on the GWR design but standard gauge. Lighting was provided by gas— two jets in first class compartments and one in second and third class compartments, and from 1877 a pressurised oil gas system was used. Initially the carriages were braked with wooden blocks operated by hand from the guards' compartments at {{the front and back}} of the train, giving off a distinctive smell. This was replaced in 1869 by a chain that operated brakes on all carriages. The operation of the chain brake could be abrupt, leading to some passenger injuries, and it was replaced by a non-automatic vacuum brake by 1876. In the 1890s, a mechanical 'next station' indicator was tested in some carriages on the circle, <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> wooden flap between the tracks. It was considered unreliable and not approved for full installation.|$|E
