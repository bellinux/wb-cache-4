30|$|We need to {{take another}} look at lung and {{thoracic}} (chest cavity) anatomy in order to understand this properly. Every organ in our bodies, such as those in the chest like the lungs and heart and those in the abdomen (stomach, intestines, liver etc.) are covered on their outer surfaces by a thin sheet of connective tissue known as the 'visceral pleura.' There is a second connective tissue sheet on the inner side of the chest and abdomen. <b>The</b> entire <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> torso is lined by this second, thin sheet of tissue that is known as the 'parietal pleura.' In the chest, there is a small space between the lungs and the chest wall, thus between the visceral and parietal pleurae. We call this the 'interpleural space' and it is filled with fluid. This liquid acts to connect or 'couple' the lung to the chest wall. In other words, in a healthy and functioning human respiratory system, one could say the lung is 'stuck' to <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chest and when the chest moves — either in or out with in-breath or out-breath — so does the lung.|$|R

6000|$|You {{will all}} {{admit that there}} is neither romance nor comfort in waiting at your own or at any one else's door on a windy and rainy day, till the servant comes {{from the end of}} the house to open it. You all know the {{critical}} nature of that opening--the drift of wind into the passage, the impossibility of putting down the umbrella at the proper moment without getting a cupful of water dropped down the back <b>of</b> <b>your</b> neck from the top of the door-way; and you know how little these inconveniences are abated by the common Greek portico at the top of the steps. You know how the east winds blow through those unlucky couples of pillars, which are all that your architects find consistent with due observance of the Doric order. Then, away with these absurdities; and the next house you build, insist upon having the pure old Gothic porch, walled in on both sides, with its pointed arch entrance and gable roof above. Under that, you can put down your umbrella at your leisure, and, if you will, stop a moment to talk with your friend as you give him the parting shake of the hand. And if now and then a wayfarer found a moment's rest on a stone seat on each side of it, I believe you would find <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> houses not one whit the less comfortable; and, if you answer me, that were such refuges built in the open streets, they would become mere nests of filthy vagrants, I reply that I do not despair of such a change in the administration of the poor laws of this country, as shall no longer leave any of our fellow creatures in a state in which they would pollute the steps of our houses by resting upon them for a night. But if not, the command to all of us is strict and straight, [...] "When thou seest the naked, that thou cover him, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house."[13] Not to the work-house, observe, but to thy house: and I say it would be better a thousandfold, that our doors should be beset by the poor day by day, than that it should be written of any one of us, [...] "They reap every one his corn in the field, and they gather the vintage of the wicked. They cause the naked to lodge without shelter, that they have no covering in the cold. They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock, for want of a shelter."[14] ...|$|R

6000|$|Her {{declaration}} seemed {{somehow to}} close the incident, {{and we were all}} silent a moment, which I employed in looking about the room, and taking in with my literary sense the simplicity and even bareness of its furnishing. There was the bed where the invalid lay, and near the head a table with a pile of books and a kerosene-lamp on it, and I decided that she was a good deal wakeful, and that she read by that lamp when she could not sleep at night. Then there were the hard chairs we sat on, and some home-made hooked rugs, in rounds and ovals, scattered about the clean floor; there was a small melodeon pushed against the wall; the windows had paper shades, and I recalled that I had not seen any blinds {{on the outside of the}} house. Over the head of the bed hung a cavalryman's sword, with its belt--the sword that Mrs. Makely had spoken of. It struck me as a room where a great many things might have happened, and I said: [...] "You can't think, Mrs. Camp, how glad I am to see <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> house.

40|$|To {{say that}} {{rats and mice}} make unwelcome house guests is {{probably}} theunderstatement of the month. Aside from the “eeek ” factor, there is thelegitimate concern about disease. (It turns out that fear of vectors need not be confined to those who failed physics.) Rats can carry a dozen diseases including plague, and they contaminate about ten times as much food as they eat. Although mice seem to be considerably more acceptable to humans than rats, an effect that has been dubbed the “Disney influence, ” mice carry {{many of the same}} pathogens that rats do. From a public health standpoint alone, {{it is important to have}} zero tolerance for rodents <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> home. In addition, both rats and mice sometimes start house fires by gnawing through electrical wires. Rat and mouse poison can be purchased at almost any grocery store, yet, surpris-ingly, the pros do not recommend using poison. Why not? Well, of course, there is the toxicity of the poison, which poses a hazard to children and pets and means that the leftovers will have to be disposed of as a hazardous waste. In addition, mice and rats have already developed resistance to Warfarin and several other types of poisons.

40|$|Almost {{two months}} to the day the first mobile virus appeared, a second bug has struck. Like the Cabir worm, the new Mosquito Trojan targets {{handsets}} running the Symbian Series 60 operating system. Mosquito first appeared in mid-August and {{takes its name from}} the Mosquitos game published by Ojom for Symbian-based camera phones. The virus writers hacked the game, embedded a Trojan Horse and then distributed the corrupted version for free on the internet. The Trojan Horse malware concept is named after the mythical, apparently innocent, wooden horse left outside the gates of Troy. It actually hid soldiers, who emerged after the horse had been dragged <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> city. Trojan software is designed to look like an innocent piece of software, but hidden within it is a malicious software program that can do a great deal <b>of</b> damage once <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> gates <b>of</b> <b>your</b> computer. Infected handsets send text messages to premium-rate services without the user’s knowledge, racking up big phone bills in the process. However, users can easily tell whether their version of Mosquitos carries the Trojan. First, when preparing to download the game, they are warned that the game’s supplier cannot be verified. Once installed, the opening screen boasts: “This version has been cracked by Soddom Bin Loader. No rights reserved. Pirate copies are illegal and offenders will have lotz of phun!!! ” Symbian says that uninstalling the game should remove the Mosquito Trojan, too. Although they both target the same type of device, there are some key differences between Mosquito and Cabir, which first appeared on June 14. For example, Mosquito is spread by downloading a game over the wireless network, while Cabir uses Bluetooth to spread. That difference shows how quickly virus writers have found different ways to exploit wireless devices. (For more information about mobile viruses, including the Cabir worm, see the June 2004 issue of Wireless Security Perspectives.)
