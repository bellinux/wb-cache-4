5|$|For the U.S. program {{there were}} {{teething}} troubles. There {{was a lack}} of sufficient numbers of sensor strings and controlling the number of aircraft available for the missions proved problematic. These difficulties could be remedied. Commando Hunt II (1 May through 31 October 1969), however, was <b>thrown</b> <b>off</b> track by phenomena that the Air Force could do absolutely nothing about. The first wet season offensive was hampered by atrocious weather, especially heavy rain (48inches of rain in July alone).|$|E
5|$|Jim White, {{the coach}} at Los Angeles Harbor College, had watched Johnson play street basketball; feeling that Johnson excelled in defense, White {{asked him to}} enroll. Johnson gave up his jobs and {{developed}} into a promising young guard, averaging 18.3 points and 12.0 rebounds per game and leading Harbor to a college junior state title. However, the young guard lacked discipline, often clashed with White and was <b>thrown</b> <b>off</b> the team three times in two years.|$|E
5|$|Keldric and Faye, {{with the}} help of the great beast, Flammie, force the Lorimarian army to leave the village. They chase after Stroud, {{catching}} up to him at the coast. There they free Ritzia, only to be attacked by Stroud, wielding the other part of the key—the Sword of Mana. Keldric is <b>thrown</b> <b>off</b> of Stroud's airship, and the Lorimarians invade Illusia again. Stroud opens the portal, and a wave of dark energy is released, transforming the Tree, turning the people of Illusia into monsters called Grimlies, and releasing dark monsters from Mavolia. Keldric and Faye flee, and head for Fa'Diel.|$|E
5000|$|A player [...] "throws off" [...] when, after a fail card {{is played}} and the player {{does not have}} any of that fail suit but does have trump, decides to play a fail card rather than trump. The <b>throw</b> <b>off</b> is key to winning at Sheepshead. One must know when to <b>throw</b> <b>off</b> and when not to <b>throw</b> <b>off.</b> One popular {{situation}} to <b>throw</b> <b>off</b> is as follows and is known as [...] "The Throw Off"; (1) a fail suit is led that the picker does not have, (2) the picker is 2nd in line, and (3) the picker <b>throws</b> <b>off,</b> usually because he has a poor hand, hoping his partner can take the trick.|$|R

60|$|Whistler {{never ceased}} to be an artist. As Mr. Max Beerbohm pointed out {{in one of his}} {{extraordinarily}} sensible and sincere critiques, Whistler really regarded Whistler as his greatest work of art. The white lock, the single eyeglass, the remarkable hat--these were much dearer to him than any nocturnes or arrangements that he ever <b>threw</b> <b>off.</b> He could <b>throw</b> <b>off</b> the nocturnes; for some mysterious reason he could not <b>throw</b> <b>off</b> the hat. He never <b>threw</b> <b>off</b> from himself that disproportionate accumulation of aestheticism which is the burden of the amateur.|$|R
5|$|A {{cheerleader}} at school, Lawrence {{also played}} softball, field hockey and basketball, which she {{played on a}} boys team that her father coached. She was fond of horseback riding while growing up and frequently visited a local horse farm. She has a damaged coccyx from being <b>thrown</b> <b>off</b> a horse. The actress has said that {{she knew she would}} be famous from an early age. When her father worked from home, she performed for him, often dressing up as a clown or ballerina. Her first acting assignment was at the age of nine with the role of a prostitute in a church play based on the Book of Jonah. For the next few years, she continued to take parts in church plays and school musicals.|$|E
5|$|Despite Canterbury's walls, a Viking army {{successfully}} {{attacked the}} city in 835, killing many of the inhabitants. Scandinavian raids recommenced from 991 onwards and in 1011 a Danish army demanded fresh tribute from the city. The city walls were used to defend the city during an 11-day siege, and the chronicler Roger of Hoveden recounts how the attacking Danes were <b>thrown</b> <b>off</b> {{the tops of the}} walls to their deaths by the citizens. Roger's account may be an exaggeration, but the story shows that the city walls were in sufficiently good condition for such a story to be considered plausible at the time. After a fire broke out in the city, however, the Danes entered and pillaged Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|In 1979 Tonelli {{failed to}} defend his US title in the 100m backstroke, but managed third in the event at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championships in his final year of university. In his four years at Alabama, he was an eight-time All-American in the 100m and 200m backstroke. His triumph at the NCAA Championships came amid the {{backdrop}} of a teammate's death in a waterskiing accident during a social event {{with a group of}} fellow swimmers. Tonelli was driving the powerboat when he did a U-turn that resulted in his teammate being <b>thrown</b> <b>off</b> his skis and into the water. The boat's propellor then struck the man, who died due to severe cuts and blood loss.|$|E

5|$|In America, {{neoconservative}} {{aspirations to}} use the United States' military power to further destroy evildoers are <b>thrown</b> <b>off</b> track by the election of George H. W. Bush to the presidency, followed by the election in 1992 of Bill Clinton which left them totally out of power. The neoconservatives, along with their conservative Christian allies, attempt to demonize Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To their disappointment, the American people do not turn against Clinton. Meanwhile, Islamist attempts at revolution end in massive bloodshed, leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden flee to the relative safety of Afghanistan and declare a new strategy. To fight Western-inspired moral decay, they must deal a blow to its source: the United States.|$|E
5|$|Repair work on Gneisenau was {{completed}} by 26 February 1942, and she was scheduled to deploy to Norway on 6 March. Despite {{the fact that she}} was still in dry dock, her ammunition stores had been restocked and she was prepared for a short round of trials before her departure. On the night of 26–27 February, however, the British launched a heavy air raid on the ship. The ship was hit by a single bomb in her forecastle that penetrated the armored deck and exploded. Red-hot bomb fragments ignited propellant charges in the forward turret and caused a tremendous explosion. The turret was <b>thrown</b> <b>off</b> its mount and the entire bow section was burned out. The crew partially flooded the magazine to prevent a more catastrophic explosion. The blast killed 112 men and wounded 21 others.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer never regained {{consciousness}} and succumbed to his injuries {{at the hospital}} two days later on 15 July 1950. The investigation into the accident concluded that though {{the impact of the}} two vehicles was severe, it seemed unlikely that the collision itself was the cause of his injuries. It was speculated {{that at least one of}} the truck's cargo of 30 empty gas cylinders, which were <b>thrown</b> <b>off</b> by the collision, had struck Schnaufer on the head. Subsequently, the truck driver was charged with manslaughter and breach of traffic regulations before a court at Jauge, Cestas. The hearing began on 29 July 1950 and concluded with his conviction on 16 November 1950. Gasc was found guilty of not yielding the right of way, and his speed was considered too high. It was ruled that as a consequence of not observing the law, he involuntarily caused the death of Schnaufer.|$|E

5|$|The {{hospital}} ship , {{which had been}} sent out to rescue survivors from the sunken boats, was seized by the British for violating the Hague Convention rules {{on the use of}} {{hospital ship}}s. The loss of a squadron of German torpedo boats led to a drastic change in tactics in the English Channel and along the coast of Flanders. There were fewer sorties into the Channel and the torpedo boat force was relegated to coastal patrol and rescuing aircrew. The British received a bonus on 30 November, when a trawler pulled up the sealed chest <b>thrown</b> <b>off</b> S119 by Captain Thiele. The chest contained a German codebook used by the German light forces stationed on the coast, allowing the British to read German wireless communication for long afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The interdiction effort during Commando Hunt VI (15 May through 31 October 1971) was <b>thrown</b> <b>off</b> by Lam Son 719 during April and May. During the offensive, 80 {{percent of}} all U.S. aerial sorties were {{directed}} to support it. This highlighted what was now rapidly becoming a dual dilemma for the Air Force: First, the gradual withdrawal of U.S. forces from Southeast Asia meant that there were fewer and fewer air assets available with which to conduct more and more missions. During Commando Hunt, for example, 1,777 aircraft were utilized during the campaign. By {{the time of the}} opening of Commando Hunt VI, that figure had decreased to 1,199 aircraft and this number dropped to 953 before that phase was completed; Second, this state of affairs was exacerbated by the withdrawal of sorties to conduct missions for Operation Freedom Deal in Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|About {{halfway between}} Ngok Tavak and Khâm Đức, White {{and the rest}} of the column climbed a {{mountain}} where they cleared the jungle to create a landing zone, and called for helicopters to evacuate the survivors. A flight of CH-46 Sea Knights later arrived and, in a scene that would be repeated at Khâm Đức, chaos descended on the allied formation as Nung and U.S personnel fought their way onto the helicopters. Some of the Nung soldiers had to be <b>thrown</b> <b>off</b> because the helicopters quickly reached their limit capacity; eventually U.S. aircrews had to dump some of their equipment overboard to accommodate the last remaining Nungs on the landing zone. By 08:00, the evacuation of the Ngok Tavak survivors was completed, and White immediately flew out to Đà Nẵng along with the two Australian Warrant Officers after they arrived in Khâm Đức. The fight at Ngok Tavak, though short in duration, took a heavy toll on the allied forces. An unknown number of Nung soldiers and 12 U.S. military personnel were killed, and 52 (including two U.S. Army and 21 U.S Marines) were wounded.|$|E

5|$|Gloucester was {{involved}} in a brief skirmish with the Scots on 23June, the day before the main battle. While the king considered whether to camp for the night or to engage the Scots immediately, Gloucester and Hereford – either through insubordination or a misunderstanding – charged directly into the place called the New Park, where the Scots were encamped. The English immediately ran into difficulties, and Hereford's cousin Henry de Bohun was killed by King Robert the Bruce. It was perhaps during the subsequent retreat that Gloucester was <b>thrown</b> <b>off</b> his horse, but managed to escape unharmed. The next day the English were still not entirely decided on the course of action. While Gloucester took the part of certain experienced captains, recommending that Edward avoid battle that day, the younger men surrounding the king labelled this lethargic and cowardly, and advised attack. According to the Vita Edwardi, when Edward grew angry and accused Gloucester of treason, the earl forcefully replied that he would prove his loyalty on the field of battle.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{arriving}} in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination {{because of his}} skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour. He {{was not allowed to}} sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance <b>thrown</b> <b>off</b> a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.|$|E

5|$|Shortly before Golden Abyss, Guerro {{had enough}} money to equip his army with guns, turrets, {{vehicles}} and explosives, but still needed more. He was approached by an archaeologist, Vincent Perez, and his partner Jason Dante, who wished to investigate ruins within Guerro's territory on a potential lead to Quivira, one of the Seven Cities of Gold. Guerro agreed, presumably planning to kill both Perez and Dante {{when he had the}} gold, which he would use to fund the revolution. After Perez's disappearance, he allowed Dante to take over the excavation only if he complied with orders. Guerro interrogates both Chase and Dante after he captures Drake. Chase manages to escape with Drake and her amulet. Guerro captures Chase and steals the sword of Stephen from Drake. Drake and Sully find the Serpent Temple where Dante's mercenaries and Guerro's thugs are fighting.Guerro wounds Chase badly before being <b>thrown</b> <b>off</b> a bridge by Nate.|$|E
5|$|Detective Joe Salerno (Derek Russo), a {{very dear}} friend of Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn), is found dead, after {{being run over}} by Sara Gonzales (Diane Guerrero). When Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) arrives on scene, she concludes {{that he was dead}} before the car hit him, having been <b>thrown</b> <b>off</b> the bridge above the road. A distraught Samantha and Megan visit Joe's wife Helen (Kathryn Meisle) and their {{daughter}} Becky (Fátima Ptacek). Helen says that Joe had been distant before he died, after he was under review for assaulting Chuck Foster (John Magaro). Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) discovers Joe was doing freelance work on a cold case involving Lizzy Adler (Rebecca Blumhagen), a student athlete who was murdered, with Chuck being the prime suspect. Megan, Bud, Samantha and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) talk to Lizzy's lacrosse coach, Hal Davis, who states that Joe had been visiting the team recently. Megan exhumes Lizzy's body, without her boss, Kate Murphy's (Jeri Ryan), permission. Megan gets her judge mother, Joan (Joanna Cassidy) to sign the request, who tells Megan that Lizzy is buried in the same graveyard as Megan's father David, who committed suicide when Megan was twelve. Megan and Peter later visit David's grave.|$|E
5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople {{try to figure out}} whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be <b>thrown</b> <b>off</b> a cliff with a broomstick; if she is a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that she really is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to do just that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches gingerbread men instead. The witches like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain says that is how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E
