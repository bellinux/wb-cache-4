5|$|In {{the year}} before his {{retirement}} on August 1, 1965, the national council began a program to update the Wood Badge program and shift its emphasis from teaching Scoutcraft to leadership skills. After he was officially retired, his opinion was still sought after and respected. Dr. John W. Larson, Director of Boy Scout Leader Training for the National Council, was working with Béla H. Bánáthy and Bob Perin, Assistant National Director, Volunteer <b>Training</b> <b>Service,</b> to adapt the leadership competencies of the White Stag Leadership Development Program into a new Wood Badge syllabus.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1942 he {{established}} and refined the administrative infrastructure for aviation training. Radford oversaw the massive {{growth of the}} training division, establishing separate sections for administration; Physical <b>Training</b> <b>Service</b> Schools; and training devices; and sections to train various aviators in flight, aircraft operation, radio operation, and gunnery. The section also organized technical training and wrote training literature. He also engineered the establishment of four field commands for pilot training. Air Primary Training Command commanded all pre-flight schools and Naval reserve aviation bases in the country. Air Intermediate Training Command administered Naval Air Station Pensacola and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi where flight training was conducted. Air Operational Training Command {{was in charge of}} all education of pilots between pilot training and their first flying assignments. Finally, Air Technical Training Command trained enlisted men for support jobs in aviation such as maintenance, engineering, aerography, and parachute operations. Radford sought to integrate his own efficient leadership style into the organization of these schools.|$|E
5|$|Cadets have a rank {{structure}} {{similar to}} the United States Air Force enlisted and officer grades, excluding those of general officers. A cadet starts as a cadet airman basic, and is promoted {{as he or she}} completes each achievement. Unlike the regular armed forces, where it is possible to enter as either directly as a commissioned following completion of some form of officer <b>training</b> (<b>service</b> academy, college ROTC, or OCS/OTS, etc.), or enlist and eventually advance to non-commissioned officer or petty officer status, a CAP cadet must be promoted through every CAP cadet enlisted grade in order to achieve the rank of CAP cadet second lieutenant. To complete an achievement, a cadet must pass a physical fitness test as well as two written tests, one for leadership and one for aerospace education. The only exceptions to this rule are the promotions to cadet airman and cadet staff sergeant, which have no aerospace test. For some achievements, an additional test of drill proficiency is required. In the new promotion system, effective as of 2010, there is a drill test for all CAP cadet enlisted grades.|$|E
40|$|<b>Train</b> <b>service</b> {{network is}} a network form of <b>train</b> <b>service</b> plan. The {{controllability}} of the <b>train</b> <b>service</b> plan determines the recovery {{possibility of the}} <b>train</b> <b>service</b> plan in emergencies. We first build the small-world model for <b>train</b> <b>service</b> network and analyze the scale-free character of it. Then based on the linear network controllability theory, we discuss the LB model adaptability in <b>train</b> <b>service</b> network controllability analysis. The LB model is improved and we construct the <b>train</b> <b>service</b> network and define the connotation of the driver nodes based on the immune propagation and cascading failure in the <b>train</b> <b>service</b> network. An algorithm {{to search for the}} driver nodes, turning the <b>train</b> <b>service</b> network into a bipartite graph, is proposed and applied in the <b>train</b> <b>service</b> network. We analyze the controllability of the <b>train</b> <b>service</b> network of China with the method and the results of the computing case prove the feasibility of it...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTrain {{service network}} is a network which is {{constructed}} {{according to a}} set of <b>train</b> <b>service</b> plan. To optimize the <b>train</b> <b>service</b> plan, {{especially in the case of}} emergency, this paper convert the <b>train</b> <b>service</b> plan into <b>train</b> <b>service</b> network.

25|$|Baylor University, {{like most}} schools, was {{successful}} in the multiple missions of aiding national defense, recruiting soldiers, and keeping the institution operational while the war continued. Texas Tech University likewise had many roles in the war; the most famous was the War <b>Training</b> <b>Service</b> Pre-Flight program during 1943–44. It prepared Air Force pilots for full-fledged military aviation training. The efforts of Clent Breedove and M. F. Dagley, private contractors for the Civilian Pilot Training Program at the university site since 1939, with Harold Humphries as chief pilot, brought an economic boost to Lubbock. 3,750 cadets received classroom instruction and flying time. From February 1943 to January 1944, more than 2,000 women completed training at the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps Branch Number One, Army Administration School, at Stephen F. Austin State Teacher's College in Nacogdoches.|$|E
25|$|Under the Department of Labor, the Veterans' Employment and <b>Training</b> <b>Service</b> (VETS) {{offers a}} variety of {{programs}} targeted at ending homelessness among veterans.

In addition, the VETS program also has an Incarcerated Veterans' Transition Program as well as services that are unique to female Veterans. Mainstream programs initiated by the Department of Labor have included the Workforce Investment Act, One-Stop Career Centers, and a Community Voice Mail system that helps to connect homeless individuals around the United States with local resources. In addition, targeted labor programs have included the Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Project, the Disability Program Navigator Initiative, efforts to end chronic homelessness through providing employment and housing projects, Job Corps, and the Veterans Workforce Investment Program (VWIP).|$|E

5000|$|In the 1990s, {{the era of}} {{continuous}} growth came to end. Ridership shrank {{as a result of}} a recession in the early part of the decade. In spite of this, GO extended limited rush hour GO <b>Train</b> <b>service</b> to Barrie, Guelph, Acton and Oshawa in 1990. In the same year, GO also introduced off-peak <b>train</b> <b>service</b> on the Milton line, much of which only operated as far west as Erindale. In May 1992, while GO Transit celebrated its 25th birthday, all-day GO <b>Train</b> <b>service</b> was extended to Burlington with the building of a new station at Aldershot. However, in 1993 Ontario NDP premier Bob Rae announced the Social Contract, which would see a [...] "temporary" [...] reduction in spending on <b>services.</b> Consequentially GO <b>Train</b> <b>service</b> to Barrie, Guelph and Acton was eliminated.
