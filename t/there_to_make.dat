5|$|NWOBHM bands {{had been}} touring {{steadily}} in the United States, {{but had not}} yet received enough FM radio airplay <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a significant impression on American charts. Def Leppard remedied that, releasing Pyromania {{at the beginning of}} 1983, an album with a more melodic and FM-friendly approach in comparison with the more aggressive sound of their earlier music. The band's goal of reaching a wider international audience, which included many female fans, was attained completely in the US, where Pyromania peaked at No.2 on the Billboard 200 chart behind Michael Jackson's Thriller. Thanks to a string of hit singles and the heavy rotation of their music videos on the recently launched MTV, the album had sold more than six millions copies in the US by 1984 and made Def Leppard superstars. The overwhelming international success of Pyromania induced both American and British bands to follow Def Leppard's example, giving a decisive boost to the more commercial and melodic glam metal and heralding the end of the NWOBHM.|$|E
5|$|The cricketer {{refused to}} think that his {{candidacy}} was simply <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up the numbers, and he told Bolte as much. The start of the election campaign coincided with the 1954–55 grade cricket finals. Loxton took 7 wickets and scored 129 runs to help Prahran claim the title {{for the first time}} in 32 years, and was hailed as a local hero. It capped off a season in which he topped the competition batting averages and took the most wickets. In a close-run contest, the cricketer defeated the sitting ALP member Bob Pettiona by only 14 votes on the two party preferred count. He was aided by preferences from the Democratic Labor Party (DLP), which had broken away from the ALP during the 1950s, claiming that it was too soft towards communism; fears of left-wing influence was causing great concern in Australian society at the time. Loxton polled 35.70% of the first preferences, well behind Pettiona's 47.25%, but received almost all of the DLP's 13.66% of the vote as preferences to end with 50.04%. The result helped bring Bolte's Liberals to power, and they stayed in office until 1982, by which time Loxton had retired.|$|E

25|$|Venus Cloacina ("Venus the Purifier"); {{a fusion}} of Venus with the Etruscan water goddess Cloacina, who had an ancient shrine above the outfall of the Cloaca Maxima, {{originally}} a stream, later covered over to function as Rome's main sewer. The shrine contained a statue of Venus, whose rites were probably meant to purify the culvert's polluted waters and noxious airs. Pliny the Elder, remarking Venus as a goddess of union and reconciliation, identifies the shrine with a legendary episode in Rome's earliest history, when the warring Romans and Sabines, carrying branches of myrtle, met <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> peace.|$|E
25|$|Van Gogh {{depicted}} the view {{at different times}} of day and under various weather conditions, including sunrise, moonrise, sunshine-filled days, overcast days, windy days, and one day with rain. While the hospital staff did not allow Van Gogh to paint in his bedroom, he was able <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sketches in ink or charcoal on paper; eventually he would base newer variations on previous versions. The pictorial element uniting all of these paintings is the diagonal line coming in from the right depicting the low rolling hills of the Alpilles mountains. In fifteen of the twenty-one versions, cypress trees are visible beyond the far wall enclosing the wheat field. Van Gogh telescoped the view in six of these paintings, most notably in F717 Wheat Field with Cypresses and The Starry Night, bringing the trees closer to the picture plane.|$|E
500|$|The {{collapse}} {{was heavily}} condemned. Fingleton said England [...] "encountered something [...] {{which they had}} not known in post-war cricket with Australia {{and did not know}} how to handle it". O'Reilly called the capitulation a [...] "disgustingly bad show". He asked what [...] "was <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> bowlers...pulverize the carefully chosen cream of English batting on a perfect wicket?" [...] before concluding that the collapse was caused by [...] "an unfortunate absence of concentration" [...] rather than the opposition bowling. Both thought England had wasted an opportunity to put themselves in an unassailable position.|$|E

In 2008, McCaw told the IRB:"My main role as a flanker is, defensively, to tie in with the back line to ensure that the defence works well. On attack I think my primary role at first phase is to look after our ball. You attack the back line and I'm usually the first person <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure we secure that ball.

500|$|Writing in Ars Technica, Kyle Orland called Depression Quest [...] "one of {{the most}} {{gripping}} and educational views on the subject [...] ". Adam Smith, in Rock, Paper, Shotgun, wrote that Depression Quest was [...] "'game' as communication, comfort and tool of understanding". In Giant Bomb, Patrick Klepek praised Depression Quests writing, and said that [...] "by the end, [...] was able to say [...] understood depression a bit better". He also warns players not to expect the game to be enjoyable, saying: [...] "Playing Depression Quest isn't 'fun', like watching Schindler's List isn't 'enjoyable'. They're important for different reasons, and it's okay if they exist for the small audiences who will appreciate them as they are." [...] Depression Quest designer Quinn also headed a Playboy article which featured several video games dealing directly with the subjective experience of depression, in which she noted [...] "I'm very interested in games that aren't <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the player feel exceptional." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with New York Magazine, Matsoukas explained her response to Beyoncé's proposal: [...] "I was like, 'Let's get into the toxic world and what we really do that is so damaging to ourselves, {{and use it as}} a microcosm for our society'. Obviously, those ideas don't just live in the pageant world; they live in our world. And that's what the song is about. And it felt like we had to take it <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it have meaning, because otherwise it would be a superficial, preachy kind of song and visual." [...] A scene from the clip which depicts Beyoncé preparing plastic surgery, consuming diet pills and vomiting, was initially excluded from the video's final cut. However, Beyoncé decided to include the scene to fulfill her role in the clip's premise. Another scene featuring Beyoncé drowning in water while the beauty contest's host questions her life aspirations, was originally intended to depict her falling onstage. However, the scene failed to surface because of time constraints.|$|E

500|$|Saiz {{wanted to}} keep the video mostly in the moment without much narrative; he said, [...] " [...] wanted it to be more about the girls, doing the {{performance}} with Beyoncé taking a backseat as a kind of madam character"; in order to convey that idea, the singer does not sing the song's lyrics in the video. He envisioned the clip as being [...] "sexy and provocative, but not so overt", leaning to more sophisticated visuals. In an interview with New York magazine, Saiz affirmed that there are many references to 1990s eroticism and the 1995 video for [...] "Human Nature" [...] by American singer Madonna in the clip for [...] "Yoncé". Elaborating further on the video shoot, Saiz told BuzzFeed, [...] "The girls were incredible. Everyone kind of checked whatever ego at the door and we were all <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> something fun and special." [...] He described the cast as being [...] "spontaneous and not at all contrived". Joan Smalls revealed during an interview that the crew did not follow a certain script while filming and added it was [...] "up for interpretation" [...] - she mentioned the scene where she licks Beyoncé's breast as her own idea, getting inspiration from the song's lyrics.|$|E
500|$|The Millennium Earl {{has been}} well {{received}} by manga, anime and other publications. Reviewing the manga's first volume, A. E. Sparrow of IGN compared him to three of Batmans villains: Penguin, the Joker and Two-Face, finding those similarities appealing. Additionally, Sparrow called the Millennium Earl a [...] "menacing villain you'll love to hate". Ross Liversidge of UK Anime Network also enjoyed the character, praising his changing design and villainous deeds. Sheena McNeil agreed, saying that the Earl works well as the series' villain with his [...] "loving tone {{as indicated by the}} hearts in his speech bubbles and his perpetual grin, both of which are <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him all the more sinister by masking his true nature". Tom Tonhat of the Escapist also praised the Earl's modus operandi of reviving the dead as Akuma, seeing it as a strong theme that allows viewers to symphatize with his victims. He also noted that the character's initial appearance as [...] "nonthreatening as a portly gentleman clown" [...] made his actions more hateful. Todd Douglass, Jr. of DVD Talk called the Earl's transformation of humans into Akuma [...] "fiendish". Lynzee Loveridge of Anime News Network included him on the website's [...] "7 Clowns to Haunt Your Nightmares" [...] list. Erin Finnegan of ANN found the character enigmatic because he [...] "hangs out in an extra-dimensional space with randomly floating jack-o'-lanterns" [...] and compared him to Mad Pierrot from the Cowboy Bebop anime series.|$|E
500|$|Still {{hoping to}} work on Cheers, Mirkin sent a spec script of an episode of Taxi to Cheers writers Ken Levine and David Isaacs. The two {{approved}} and offered Mirkin a freelance job writing one of the final nine episodes of the show's first season, pending their commissioning by NBC. The episodes were commissioned, but Mirkin's agent rejected the Cheers job without telling his client, failing to see why Mirkin would want {{to work on}} {{what was then the}} lowest-rated comedy on television. Mirkin sacked the agent and signed on with Robb Rothman. Rothman knew Dan Wilcox, the executive producer of Newhart, which like Cheers was more character-focused. Rothman persuaded Wilcox to hire Mirkin. Mirkin wrote a freelance script and in 1984 beat seven other writers to a staff position on the series. He served as a writer and supervising story editor, before being promoted to executive producer and showrunner after one and a half years. Mirkin [...] "felt [...] was where I belonged. I'd finally come to a place in my life where everything I'd ever wanted had come together." [...] In 1987, he received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for Newhart. It was the first nomination the show had received in that category and for the first episode Mirkin wrote as the series' showrunner. Mirkin directed several of the Newhart episodes he wrote because he saw directing as [...] "a means of protecting the writing". A philosophy he carried into his later work, Mirkin felt that [...] "being the head writer... was not enough; you had to see the material through its execution– especially the weirder stuff. You had to be right <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure every sick idea didn't lose any disturbing nuance." [...] Mirkin left Newhart in 1988, desiring to work on a single-camera sitcom.|$|E
