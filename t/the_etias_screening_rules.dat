40|$|Lasso is {{a widely}} used {{regression}} technique to find sparse representations. When the dimension of the feature space {{and the number of}} samples are extremely large, solving the Lasso problem remains challenging. To improve the efficiency of solving large-scale Lasso problems, El Ghaoui and his colleagues have proposed the SAFE rules which are able to quickly identify the inactive predictors, i. e., predictors that have $ 0 $ components in the solution vector. Then, the inactive predictors or features can be removed from the optimization problem to reduce its scale. By transforming the standard Lasso to its dual form, it can be shown that the inactive predictors include the set of inactive constraints on the optimal dual solution. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective <b>screening</b> <b>rule</b> via Dual Polytope Projections (DPP), which is mainly based on the uniqueness and nonexpansiveness of the optimal dual solution {{due to the fact that}} the feasible set in the dual space is a convex and closed polytope.

Behavioral and economic models of choice processes are difficult to estimate when using stated and revealed preferences because the underlying process is latent.

The elimination by aspects theory postulates a sequential elimination of alternatives by attribute levels until a single one, the chosen alternative, remains. In the economic <b>screening</b> <b>rule</b> model, respondents <b>screen</b> out alternatives with certain attribute levels and then choose from the remaining alternatives, using a compensatory function of all the attributes.

In this paper, we develop a method to construct efficient designs for a two-stage, consider-then-choose model that involves a noncompensatory screening process at the first stage and a compensatory choice process at the second stage. The method applies to both conjunctive and disjunctive <b>screening</b> <b>rules.</b> Under certain conditions, the method also applies to the subset conjunctive and disjunctions of conjunctions <b>screening</b> <b>rules.</b> Based on the local design criterion, we conduct a comparative study of compensatory and conjunctive designs [...] the former are optimized for a compensatory model and the latter for a two-stage model that uses conjunctive screening in its first stage. We find that conjunctive designs have higher level overlap than compensatory designs. This occurs because level overlap helps pinpoint screening behavior. Higher overlap of conjunctive designs is also accompanied by lower orthogonality, less level balance, and more utility balance. We find that compensatory designs have a significant loss of design efficiency when the true model involves conjunctive screening at the consideration stage. These designs also have much less power than conjunctive designs in identifying a true consider-then-choose process with conjunctive screening. In contrast, when the true model is compensatory, the efficiency loss from using a conjunctive design is lower. Also, conjunctive designs have about the same power as compensatory designs in identifying a true compensatory choice process. Our findings make {{a strong case for}} the use of conjunctive designs when there is prior evidence to support respondent screening. experimental design, conjoint choice designs, D-optimality, consider-then-choose model, noncompensatory <b>screening</b> <b>rules...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{support vector machine}} (SVM) is {{a widely}} used method for classification. Although many efforts have been devoted to develop {{efficient}} solvers, it remains challenging to apply SVM to large-scale problems. A nice property of SVM is that the non-support vectors {{have no effect on}} the resulting classifier. Motivated by this observa-tion, we present fast and efficient <b>screening</b> <b>rules</b> to discard non-support vectors by analyzing the dual problem of SVM via variational inequalities (DVI). As a result, the number of data instances to be entered into the optimization can be sub-stantially reduced. Some appealing features of our screening method are: (1) DVI is safe {{in the sense that the}} vectors discarded by DVI are guar-anteed to be non-support vectors; (2) the data set needs to be scanned only once to run the screen-ing, and its computational cost is negligible com-pared to that of solving the SVM problem; (3) DVI is independent of the solvers and can be in-tegrated with any existing efficient solver. We also show that the DVI technique can be extend-ed to detect non-support vectors in the least ab-solute deviations regression (LAD). To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no screen-ing methods for LAD. We have evaluated DVI on both synthetic and real data sets. Experiments in-dicate that DVI significantly outperforms the ex-isting state-of-the-art <b>screening</b> <b>rules</b> for SVM, and it is very effective in discarding non-support vectors for LAD.

We have characterized the behavior of five serum tumor markers in a large cohort of healthy women and examined the implications for screening. Serial measurements of CA 125, HER- 2 /neu, urinary gonadotropin peptide, lipid-associated sialic acid, and Dianon marker 70 /K were obtained during 6 years of follow-up of 1257 healthy women {{at high risk of}} ovarian cancer. We analyzed individual-specific tumor marker behavior and explored methods that can exploit this information to develop individual-specific <b>screening</b> <b>rules.</b> These five tumor markers behaved approximately independently. Substantial heterogeneity was observed among women in the behavior of each tumor marker, particularly CA 125. Intraclass correlation (ICC), or the proportion of total variability that occurs between individuals, was approximately 0. 6 for log-transformed CA 125 and urinary gonadotropin peptide, and less than 0. 4 for the other markers. This degree of tumor marker heterogeneity among healthy women, and the relative independence of these markers, has important implications for screening and diagnostic tests. Independence of markers results in the clinically useful fact that the combined false positive rate from screening with multiple markers may be estimated by the sum of individual false positive rates. Heterogeneity of tumor marker patterns in healthy women implies that a fixed screening cutoff level is suboptimal to a degree that depends strongly on ICC. Using information on longitudinal measurements and ICC, individual-specific <b>screening</b> <b>rules</b> may be developed with the potential to improve early detection of ovarian cancer...|$|R

Marketers have recently developed statistical methods that can estimate quantitative choice models that include consideration set formation via non-compensatory <b>screening</b> <b>rules.</b> But is capturing consideration within models of choice important for design? This paper reports on a simulation study of a vehicle portfolio design when households screen over vehicle body style built to explore the importance of capturing consideration rules for optimal designers. We generate synthetic market share data, fit a variety of discrete choice models to the data, and then optimize design decisions using the estimated models. Model predictive power, design "error", and profitability relative to ideal profits are compared {{as the amount of}} market data available increases. We find that even when estimated compensatory models provide relatively good predictive accuracy, they can lead to sub-optimal design decisions when the population uses consideration behavior; convergence of compensatory models to non-compensatory behavior is likely to require unrealistic amounts of data; and modeling heterogeneity in non-compensatory screening is more valuable than heterogeneity in compensatory trade-offs. This supports the claim that designers should carefully identify consideration behaviors before optimizing product portfolios. We also find that higher model predictive power does not necessarily imply better design decisions; that is, different model forms can provide "descriptive" rather than "predictive" information that is useful for design.

METHODS: The effects of inhalation of histamine on the electrical activities of the diaphragm and parasternal intercostal muscles measured with surface electrodes were studied in 21 subjects. The experiments were repeated after inhalation of 600 micrograms of salbutamol to prevent histamine induced bronchoconstriction and concomitant mechanical stimulation of airway receptors. Subjects were connected to a closed breathing circuit to measure the changes in functional residual capacity (FRC) for the different experiments. RESULTS: The mean values of histamine induced ETIA were 60. 6 % and 46. 9 % of peak inspiratory activities during control conditions for the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, respectively. After salbutamol histamine induced ETIA was reduced to about one quarter of pre-salbutamol values. FRC increased by 427 ml as a result of inhalation of histamine, but after salbutamol this increase was only 53 ml. <b>The</b> data for <b>ETIA</b> and FRC were interpreted as indicating that the contributions of airflow limitation and ETIA to histamine induced hyperinflation are comparable.
