5|$|From here, {{the route}} becomes a two-lane {{undivided}} road that continues northeast through {{a mix of}} woods and farms with some development, passing under the abandoned Lackawanna Cut-Off. After passing through <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> Hainesburg, the road turns more {{to the east and}} enters Blairstown Township. Route 94 turns northeast before reaching <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> Blairstown, where the road continues east past some development before intersecting CR 521. It forms a short wrong-way concurrency with that route, along which it crosses the Paulins Kill. A short distance later, Route 94 enters Frelinghuysen Township, passing through more rural surroundings. The road turns northeast through <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> Marksboro before heading east again. After the intersection with CR 661, Route 94 makes a sharp turn to the north-northeast.|$|E
5|$|M-74 {{started at}} a {{junction}} with M-66 near <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> Pioneer.

5|$|PA 112 {{went through}} <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> Thornton, {{intersecting}} with Glen Mills Road. At an intersection with Thornton Road, the route crossed into Chester County, but left quickly for Delaware County again.

5|$|PA 997 curves {{northeast}} and {{heads into the}} borough of Mont Alto, where it becomes Main Street and passes homes and a few businesses, coming to an intersection with the southern terminus of PA 233. A short distance past this intersection, the route crosses back into Quincy Township and becomes Anthony Highway again, heading into farmland and entering Guilford Township. The road curves north and passes a golf course and residential development in <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> Ledy before heading through Pond Bank. PA 997 heads north-northeast between farm fields and some homes {{to the west and}} a section of Michaux State Forest to the east, passing through <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> Sidetown and crossing into Greene Township, where it continues northeast to an intersection with US 30 in <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> Greenwood.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a lot written about <b>the</b> {{benefits}} <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice (CoP) in university. <b>The</b> benefit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice was described with respect to teachers’ qualification and teaching competencies influencing students implicitly as well as to areas related to the students themselves. Many studies prove the fact that the process of learning is of a social character (e. g. Lave, Wenger, 1991). That is why <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice present suitable environment for collaborative learning which makes the process of generating, sharing and storing knowledge easier. The present paper defines on a theoretical level <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice and moreover, provides a brief overview of the latest research in <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice with regard to education. Another part of the article focuses on <b>the</b> pre-research <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice at Faculty of Economics and Management (FEM) Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CULS). Although the authors conform with the opinion that <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice are a natural feature and spontaneously develop wherever {{there is a need for}} sharing implicit or tacit knowledge, the pre-research focused on the verification of this premise in order to continue in the research of a quantitative character. <b>The</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice was verified on the basis of fundamental characteristics following Wenger’s model. Other characteristics, considered significant in relation to <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice by McDermott were also investigated. Based on a group interview <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students at FEM at CULS has been verified and a conceptual model was created. The determined work prerequisites will be investigated in another phase of the research...|$|R

5|$|Upon leaving West Buffalo Township, Buffalo Creek {{flows into}} Buffalo Township. It then turns {{northeast}} and passes by <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> Cowan and under Pennsylvania Route 192. The creek then picks up its tributary Stony Run before passing <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> Cameron {{and picking up}} Spruce Run. At this point, Buffalo Creek flows along the border between Buffalo Township and Kelly Township. Buffalo Creek then meanders in an eastward direction, passing near a quarry, <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> Kelly Point, and the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary. After leaving Buffalo Township, the creek flows briefly along the border between Kelly Township and Lewisburg before discharging into the West Branch Susquehanna River.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} from East Lenox, PA106 continues southeastward through {{fields and}} soon into {{a region of}} residences. The southeastern stretch continues for several miles into <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> West Clifford. There, PA106 passes some homes and intersects with PA374. The two designations become concurrent, paralleling the alignment of the Milford and Owego Turnpike Road through West Clifford. PA106 and PA374 head southward and soon turn southwestward through forestry, until clearing into <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> Royal. In the small community, PA106 and PA374 fork, with PA374 heading southwestward to Glenwood and PA106 heading southeastward through Royal. PA106 continues further, entering deep woods once again after leaving Royal. At the intersection with Cemetery Road, the highway enters a large cemetery and into Clifford. There, the route crosses through a large residential and commercial community, intersecting with State Route2008 (SR2008). The route continues southeastward through the residential area before crossing the county line into Lackawanna County.|$|E

5|$|At this point, PA 997 turns {{east for}} a short {{concurrency}} with US 30 on Lincoln Way East before turning north onto Black Gap Road. The road curves northwest and heads through wooded areas with some fields and homes. Farther northwest, the route runs through farmland with some residential and commercial development, and gains a center left-turn lane as it passes to the northeast of the Chambersburg Mall. PA 997 widens to a four-lane divided highway and comes to an intersection with the southern terminus of PA 696 and an interchange with I-81, with the ramps serving the northbound lanes of I-81 connecting to PA 696. Past this interchange, the route narrows to a two-lane undivided road and turns north and northwest through fields and woods to bypass <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> Scotland, coming to a bridge over Norfolk Southern's Lurgan Branch. The road curves west and then northwest and becomes Cumberland Highway, running through farmland with some woods and residential and commercial development.
