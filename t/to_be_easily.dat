5|$|Australind Bypass {{was opened}} on 16 December 1988 by Federal Transport Minister Bob Brown, who helped {{complete}} the final seal, {{together with the}} Mayor of Bunbury Ern Manea. State Transport Minister Bob Pearce planted a roadside tree to commemorate {{the opening of the}} bypass, which was also attended by the Commissioner of Main Roads Albert Tognolini, and Mitchell MLA David Smith, Minister for Community Service, Justice and the South West. Vintage cars led a procession from the on-site opening ceremony to a reception held in Bunbury. The new road was designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> made into a dual carriageway when required; this was completed nine years later, with the Australind Bypass duplication project officially opened by Mitchell MLA Dan Sullivan on 18 December 1997.|$|E
5|$|Fiberglass is a fiber {{reinforced}} polymer made {{of plastic}} reinforced by glass fibers, commonly woven into a mat. The glass fibers used in the material are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use. These glasses all contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of calcium, magnesium, and sometimes boron. The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase {{the strength of the}} glass, or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of silica, which is too high <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> worked in its pure form to make glass fibers.|$|E

The new gliders were to be constructed entirely of metal, and were also required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> adaptable to a powered configuration. As part of a five-year development program, a contract was awarded to the Chase Aircraft Company of Trenton, New Jersey, in August 1946 {{for the construction of}} two types of gliders. These included a smaller model being designated XCG-18A, and the larger, definitive model being designated XCG-20.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Hatoful Boyfriend {{is similar}} to most other visual novels for the PC, with the {{controls}} limited to the mouse and the only interactions being clicking to forward the game's narrative or to choose between multiple plot choices.

The save button can be employed at any point during the game, which also features several pages of save slots, allowing gameplay <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> picked up from prior to a choice the player made. An arrow button in the upper right corner also allows the player to skip dialogue and interactions they have already experienced.|$|E
5|$|In 1949 the Armenian Academy of Sciences began major {{excavations}} of the Garni fortress site led by Babken Arakelyan. Architectural historian Alexander Sahinian {{focused on}} the temple itself. It was not until almost twenty years later, on December 10, 1968, that the Soviet Armenian government approved the reconstruction plan of the temple. A group led by Sahinian began reconstruction works in January 1969. It was completed by 1975, almost 300 {{years after it was}} destroyed in an earthquake. The temple was almost entirely rebuilt using its original stones, except the missing pieces which were filled with blank stones intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> recognisable. In 1978 a monument dedicated to Sahinian was erected not far from the temple.|$|E

The optical system is decoupled from the chamber, which isolates it from vibrations during operation and means that the beamlines themselves {{do not have to be}} realigned after chamber replacement.|$|E
5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare, {{commonly}} known as the pinecone mushroom, the cone tooth, or the ear-pick fungus, is a species of fungus in the family Auriscalpiaceae of the order Russulales. It was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus, who included it {{as a member of the}} tooth fungi genus Hydnum, but British mycologist Samuel Frederick Gray recognized its uniqueness and in 1821 transferred it to the genus Auriscalpium that he created to contain it. The fungus is widely distributed in Europe, Central America, North America, and temperate Asia. Although common, its small size and nondescript colors lead it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> overlooked in the pine woods where it grows. A.vulgare is not generally considered edible because of its tough texture, but some historical literature says it used to be consumed in France and Italy.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{wanted the}} Doctor to realise that Rose has {{something}} to offer to his cause. Their holding hands while running was meant to signify {{that they were a}} team, despite him not asking her yet, and they were not to question their relationship. The episode was intended to be presented from Rose's point-of-view. For audience identification purposes, Davies wanted the alien menace <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> mistaken as human, so that it was possible for Rose to mistake the aliens for humans. Davies felt that {{there was no need to}} create a new monster, as the Autons met these criteria. The Auton sequences were difficult to film because the costumes were uncomfortable for the actors; which meant that frequent breaks from filming were needed. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used in post-production to cover up the zipper on the back of the necks of the Auton costumes. Davies wanted to recreate the scene of the Autons breaking out of shop windows from their first appearance in Spearhead from Space, although he had the budget to actually smash the glass instead of just cutting around it like in Spearhead.|$|E

5|$|Depleted uranium is {{also used}} as a {{shielding}} material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> machined and cast {{as well as its}} relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter).|$|E
5|$|Early on, {{the player}} {{is given the}} choice between three {{different}} game modes, each with unique cutscenes, puzzles to solve and locations to visit: the Team Path, the Wits Path, and the Fists Path. In the Team Path, protagonist Indiana Jones is joined by his partner Sophia Hapgood who will provide support throughout the game. The Wits Path features an abundance of complex puzzles, while the Fists Path focuses heavily on action sequences and fist fighting, the latter of which is completely optional {{in the other two}} modes. Atypical for LucasArts titles, it is possible for the player character to die at certain points in the game, though dangerous situations were designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> recognizable. A score system, the Indy Quotient Points, keeps track of the puzzles solved, the obstacles overcome and the important objects found.|$|E
5|$|HMS Esk was an E-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. She was designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> converted into a fast minelayer by removing some guns and her torpedo tubes. Although assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion, the ship {{was attached to the}} Mediterranean Fleet in 1935–36, during the Abyssinia Crisis. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, she spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France {{on both sides of the}} conflict. Esk was converted to a minelayer when World War II began in September 1939, and spent most of her time laying mines. During the Norwegian Campaign of April–June 1940, the ship laid mines in Norwegian territorial waters before the Germans invaded, but was recalled to home waters to resume her minelaying duties in early May. During one such sortie, Esk was sunk during the Texel Disaster on the night of 31 August 1940, when she ran into a newly laid German minefield.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{detailed}} analysis of KBOs was impossible, and so astronomers were only able to determine the most basic facts about their makeup, primarily their color. These first data showed {{a broad range of}} colors among KBOs, ranging from neutral grey to deep red. This suggested that their surfaces were composed {{of a wide range of}} compounds, from dirty ices to hydrocarbons. This diversity was startling, as astronomers had expected KBOs to be uniformly dark, having lost most of the volatile ices from their surfaces to the effects of cosmic rays. Various solutions were suggested for this discrepancy, including resurfacing by impacts or outgassing. Jewitt and Luu's spectral analysis of the known Kuiper belt objects in 2001 found that the variation in color was too extreme <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> explained by random impacts. The radiation from the Sun is thought to have chemically altered methane on the surface of KBOs, producing products such as tholins. Makemake has been shown to possess a number of hydrocarbons derived from the radiation-processing of methane, including ethane, ethylene and acetylene.|$|E
5|$|Many {{amphibians}} are nocturnal {{and hide}} during the day, thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight. Other amphibians use camouflage {{to avoid being}} detected. They have various colourings such as mottled browns, greys and olives to blend into the background. Some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the North American northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda). Their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which {{makes it difficult for}} the predator to avoid contact with their poison-producing granular glands. A few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked, sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape. The tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> detached. The tail is regenerated later, but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{resigned}} from the Legislative Council on 16 July 1898, in order to contest the lower house seat of Young against the sitting Labour member, Chris Watson. He focused his campaign on Federation issues but was surprised <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> defeated by 1,244 votes to 876. Financial difficulties necessitated his focus on legal work rather than campaigning during the second Constitution referendum in 1899, although he still managed to speak most nights. Following the success of Federation, O'Connor {{was to be a}} member of the first Commonwealth ministry, and was instrumental in the affair that became known as the Hopetoun Blunder. Lord Hopetoun, Australia's first Governor-General, had commissioned Sir William Lyne to form a government, since Lyne was Premier of the largest state, New South Wales. O'Connor was one of those who refused to serve under Lyne, who had been lukewarm on the issue during the Federation campaigns, and was significant in the negotiations that led to Lyne's resignation of the commission in Barton's favour. On 1 January 1901, O'Connor was appointed Vice-President of the Executive Council, an honorary post, in Barton's Cabinet.|$|E
