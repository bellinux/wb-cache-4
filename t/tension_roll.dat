40|$|Fabric {{friction}} behavior: {{study using}} capstan equation and introduction into a fabric transport simulator D Kuhm 1, 2, 3, M-A Bueno 1 and D Knittel 2, 3 All thin materials, such as textiles, papers, polymers, or metals, are handled on rollers during manufacture and subse-quent use. This requires several unwinding and winding processes. The {{goal of this}} study was to investigate the friction behavior of fabrics relative to sliding velocity and to introduce friction coefficient evolution in a fabric transport model. For the experimental part, a specific fabric/roll friction bench is presented. The friction coefficient was calculated from the capstan equation. The evolution of the friction coefficient was quantified relative to the sliding velocity for different textile fabrics and also for a polymer and a paper web. The influence of some measurement process parameters was studied: web <b>tension,</b> <b>roll</b> diameter, and wrap angle. The friction coefficient initially increased with sliding velocity and then became constant. This phenomenon can be explained by the deformation of the fabric due to friction, thereby inducing an increase in web tension with the sliding velocity. The relationship between tension and rolling friction behavior of the fabric was investigated. The variability of the friction coefficient was introduced to web/roll simulator, and improvements to the simulator are shown...|$|E

Among all the <b>tensioning</b> processes, <b>roll</b> <b>tensioning</b> process is most widely applied in the cutting tool industry.

50|$|Tension {{adjustment}} is necessary due to several mechanical factors: oscillations caused by mechanical misalignments, differing inertial response (lag) of mechanical elements during web acceleration, out-of-round unwind and <b>tension</b> <b>rolls,</b> slipping through nip rolls, and over-aggressive web-guide correction. Several technical process and control issues also affect tension: tension setpoint changes, phase offset on driven <b>rolls,</b> <b>tension</b> bleed from one zone to another, and thermal effect (contraction/expansion) as the substrate passes through various processes. It {{is impossible to}} eliminate all factors requiring tension adjustment. Variance in any one factor in a zone necessitates changes in tension control and web speed. Consequently, with coupled tension zone control, jitter is inevitable in a continuous web where the controllers cause a feedback loop.|$|R
40|$|An {{introduction}} to titanium minerals is provided {{along with a}} brief history of high <b>tension</b> <b>roll</b> (HTR) separation and its applications. Current HTR theory is critically reviewed and deficiencies in previous modelling work are identified. These problems are recognised as the likely reason why past models required empirical manipulation to reproduce observed separation behaviour. An updated theory of charge decay in a particle bed is developed for HTR applications. Particle bed interactions and their effects on electrostatic forces and discharge rates are examined, leading to a reviewed analysis of force balance. The theoretical contributions are incorporated into a new HTR model which takes a mechanistic approach to describing machine operation, as opposed to previous empirical-based work in the area. A simplified electrostatic field model is also developed. Atmospheric effects on separation behaviour are ignored in the modelling. Experimental separations are used to validate new model performance, where comparisons are specifically designed to test the theoretical developments on charge decay and force balance in a particle bed. The new model is also compared to the Dance (1992) HTR model, embedded in JKSimSand, the most recent HTR model with an empirical basis. An error analysis shows the new model performs as well as, or better, than JKSimSand in most respects. The fact that this is achieved with a mechanistic approach validates the new developments in particle bed charge decay and force theory, and sets the foundation for mechanistic HTR simulation...|$|E

Because of this huge range of applications the circular saws have gained great importance in the industry. The rising request to improve the cutting quality, reduce the noise emission and increase the life time requires improvement of the dynamic behavior of the circular saw blade. The <b>roll</b> <b>tensioning</b> of the circular saw blade has been empirically established {{as a solution to}} improve the static and dynamic properties of the circular saw blade.

The process of roll-tensioning is traditionally used to increase the stability of rotating discs at high rotation speed, and so dynamic properties and critical speed, which determines the maximum stable rotation speed of the disc. Roll-tensioning consists in introducing a residual stress state in the plate. The structure is locally deformed between two opposite pinch rollers in rotation which rotate the plate. This creates a plastic deformation along a circular zone at constant radius. Manufacturers are generally able to <b>roll</b> <b>tension</b> acceptably through know-how gained from experience.

30|$|The {{tensioning}} {{stress distribution}} of {{circular saw blade}} after <b>roll</b> <b>tensioning</b> was described by Szymani [2]. In the inner loop of the tensioned region, the tangential tensioning stress is compressive, and its value increases gradually from loop of the tensioned region to inside. In the exterior loop of the tensioned region, the tangential tensioning stress is tensile, and its value decreases gradually from loop of the tensioned region to outside. This distribution of tangential tensioning stress is not very ideal relatively. The tangential tensioning stresses of circular saw blades tensioned by three levels of hammering were measured by X-ray stress meter [3, 4]. The tangential tensioning stress outside hammer region increases with radius, which is an ideal distribution. This phenomenon indicates that the distribution of tangential tensioning stress produced by hammering is more reasonable than that produced by <b>roll</b> <b>tensioning.</b> However, hammer tensioning has its limitations because the hammer tensioning creates a very irregular surface and produce localized, non-axisymmetric stresses because the force and position of spots are controlled by workers and its reproducibility and controllability {{are very difficult to}} be mastered, and it depends heavily on the experience and skills of saw repairing workers. The precision of hammer tensioning is relatively poor. Multi-spot pressure tensioning process is one kind of tensioning methods and a quasi-static process. The fixed areas of circular saw blade are pressed by spherical or cylindrical surface during multi-spot pressure tensioning process. The force and position of spots are controlled precisely by automated machinery during the multi-spot pressure tensioning process. A cyclic symmetry stress distribution and appropriate macroscopic deformation can be obtained by the multi-spot pressure tensioning process. Therefore, a more ideal distribution of tangential tensioning stress is produced during multi-spot pressure tensioning process. This tensioning approach is conducive to the realization of the automatic tensioning operation, especially in the production of ultra-thin circular saw blades.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the prediction of}} the contours of plastic work for an AZ 31 magnesium alloy sheet in the first quadrant of the stress space using a rate-dependent crystal plasticity finite-element method. The contour of plastic work was initially rather flat {{in the vicinity of}} equi-biaxial tension, but bulged severely thereafter. Evidently, the shapes of the contours changed as the plastic work increased, exhibiting a differential work-hardening behavior. The variation of the relative activity of each family of slip systems was examined to investigate the mechanism of the differential work-hardening behavior. During uniaxial tension, the work-hardening was determined mainly by the basal slip in the very beginning, whereas it was determined by both the prismatic and the basal slip in the subsequent deformation. On the other hand, during equi-biaxial tension, the relative activity of the prismatic slip systems was much smaller than that under uniaxial tension, whereas the relative activity of the basal slip systems played a dominant role in the work-hardening throughout the deformation. A simple analysis revealed that it was more difficult to activate the prismatic slip systems for equi-biaxial tension than uniaxial <b>tension</b> in <b>rolled</b> magnesium alloy sheets because the two biaxial stresses tended to cancel each other thus decreasing the relative activity as the biaxial stress ratio approached unity. On the other hand, the basal slip systems were much easily activated than the prismatic slip systems although their Schmid factors were small because the shear stress required for the activation of the basal slip systems was much lower than that of the prismatic slip systems. We concluded that such differences in the activities of the slip systems eventually resulted in the differential work-hardening behavior of the contour of plastic work...|$|R

The prismatic and basal slip systems were mainly activated during loading, but the activation of the prismatic slip systems was more dominant. Thus the overall stress level during loading was determined primarily by the prismatic slip systems. The prismatic slip systems were hardly activated during unloading because the stress level was of course lower than that during loading. On the other hand, because the strength of the basal slip systems was much lower than that of the prismatic slip systems, the basal slip systems would be easily activated under the stress level during unloading in the opposite direction when their Schmid’s resolved shear stresses changed signs because of the inhomogeneity of the material. These results indicated that one explanation for the inelastic behavior during unloading was that the basal slip systems were primarily activated owing to their low strengths compared to that of the prismatic slip systems. Numerical tests using the sheets with random orientations and with the more pronounced texture were conducted to further examine the mechanism...|$|R
