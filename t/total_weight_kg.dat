40|$|Morphometric {{data for}} {{tropical}} tunas caught with purse seine {{have been collected}} in the Indian Ocean over the last decades through routine sampling at processing factories and research projects. We estimate the parameters of allometric relationships between fork length (cm) and <b>total</b> <b>weight</b> (<b>kg)</b> for bigeye (Thunnus obesus), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) caught with purse seine in the Indian Ocean. We show that relationships currently used in the IOTC underestimate weights at length for bigeye and skipjack with potential consequences for the estimates of purse seine catch and other datasets derived from fish numbers and size data. We question the use of gear-specific length-weight relationships for tropical tunas. We recommend to carefully and systematically collect morphometric data required for conversion factors and relationships and made them available to the IOTC Secretariat as they are key in data processing and can eventually affect the monitoring {{of the status of}} tuna and tuna-like stocks in the Indian Ocean...|$|E
40|$|The Chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) of the Cape Peninsula are {{established}} raiders of human food, leading to widespread conflict between this intelligent, adaptable species and humans. The modern Western diet that these baboons have become exposed to has many deleterious effects on health, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate whether this population of baboons have lowered GLUT-­‐ 4 transporter protein levels in comparison to wild-­‐feeding baboons, as an indication of insulin abnormalities. GLUT-­‐ 4 levels were analysed via Western Blot and DXA scanning was used to compare physical characteristics between these two groups. No significant difference in GLUT-­‐ 4 levels was found, however the two groups differed in three physical variables, with the semi-­‐provisioned Peninsula group having higher <b>total</b> <b>weight</b> (<b>kg)</b> (p< 0, 05), total body lean mass (kg) (p< 0, 01) and bone mineral content (kg) (p< 0, 001) than the wild-­‐feeding controls. These results indicate that male individuals from the Peninsula population are bigger but not fatter than wild-­‐feeding male baboons from the Eastern Cape population. Although it could not be determined whether human food is causing insulin abnormalities in the Cape Peninsula’s population of Chacma baboons, this study indicates that this is a promising area of research, likely to affect the management strategies used on this population...|$|E
40|$|The {{productivity}} {{of water is}} a poorly considered indicator in animal agriculture. This is because water is a resource still believed by persons in the production network to be abundant and of good quality. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the impact of nutritional strategies in water productivity indicators for growing and slaughtering pigs. Five strategies were evaluated: control diet (T 1), with a reduction in the level of crude protein (T 2), phytase (T 3), organic minerals (T 4) and the three nutritional strategies combined (T 5). The water productivity indicator is defined as the quantity of product by water used. The following indicators were calculated: <b>total</b> <b>weight</b> (<b>kg</b> L- 1), cold carcass (kg L- 1) lean carcass (L kg- 1), and nutrition (kcal L- 1). T 5 showed the best productivities for each liter of water used. The total weight productivity in this treatment was 3. 0 kg L- 1, while in T 1 was 2. 5 kg L- 1. T 3 had the lowest productivities. The nutritional water productivities were 2, 512, 2, 763, 2, 657, 2, 814, and 3, 039 kcal L- 1, respectively for T 1, T 2, T 3, T 4, and T 5. Nutritional strategies reduce the use of drinking water and therefore improve water productivities. The best productivities were observed when combining the strategies...|$|E
