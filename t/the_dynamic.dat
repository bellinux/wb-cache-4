When <b>the</b> deterministic replicator <b>dynamic</b> is permanent and the noise level small, <b>the</b> stochastic <b>dynamic</b> admits a unique ergodic distribution whose mass is concentrated near the maximal interior attractor of the unperturbed system; thus, permanence is robust against small unbounded stochastic perturbations.
