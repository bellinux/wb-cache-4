5|$|After the work-ins had ended, work {{continued}} on finishing <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> which {{was scheduled for}} lift-on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but {{the application of a}} modern microporous paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof, was completed in time for the lift-on. A mini work-in was held the weekend before <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> was lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill. The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled. The 5-ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. The fitting of <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> was toasted with beer from Adnams Brewery, Southwold.|$|E
5|$|In Amanita abrupta, as {{with most}} mushrooms, {{the bulk of the}} {{organism}} lies unseen beneath the ground as an aggregation of fungal cells called hyphae; under appropriate environmental conditions, the visible reproductive structure (fruit body) is formed. <b>The</b> <b>cap</b> has a diameter of , and has a broadly convex shape when young, but eventually flattens. The central portion of <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> becomes depressed in mature specimens. <b>The</b> <b>cap</b> surface is verrucose—covered with small angular or pyramidal erect warts (1–2mm tall by 1–2mm wide at the base); the warts are smaller and more numerous near the margin of <b>the</b> <b>cap,</b> and small fragments of tissue may be hanging from the margin of <b>the</b> <b>cap.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cap</b> surface, the warts, and the flesh are white. The warts can be easily separated from <b>the</b> <b>cap,</b> and in mature specimens they have often completely or partly disappeared.

5|$|Inocybe maculata {{is similar}} to the {{variable}} Inocybe lacera, the split fibrecap, but it can be differentiated by the darker colouration of <b>the</b> <b>cap,</b> and the white remains of the veil in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>cap.</b> The species is also similar in appearance to Inocybe lanatodisca, but can be readily distinguished by odour (I.lanatodisca has a characteristic sweet, green-corn smell) and the colour of <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> (I.lanatodisca has a fulvous cap). It is closely related to Inocybe fastigiata, but can again be distinguished by colour; I.fastigiata has lighter coloured fibrils.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help verify an identification of L.holopus.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{fundamental}} {{solution of the}} quantum difference equation (qde) for the moduli space of instantons on two-dimensional projective space. The qde is a K-theoretic generalization of the quantum differential equation in quantum cohomology.

5|$|The {{fruit body}} is a {{medium-sized}} mushroom, with a cap 6–10cm (2.5–4in) in diameter, though larger specimens occasionally reach 15cm (6in). <b>The</b> <b>cap</b> is initially hemispherical before flattening with maturity, and has a broad, shallow umbo. <b>The</b> <b>cap</b> margin is initially curled inwards but uncurls as it matures. <b>The</b> <b>cap</b> surface is silvery-grey and covered with concentrically patterned darker scales of a grey, brown or blackish colour that grow paler toward <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> margin, Secretan noting its resemblance to <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> of Sarcodon imbricatus.

5|$|An {{emissions}} trading scheme for {{greenhouse gas emissions}} (GHGs) works by establishing property rights for the atmosphere. The atmosphere is a global public good, and GHG emissions are an international externality (p.21). The emissions from all sources of GHGs contribute to the overall stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. In the cap-and-trade variant of {{emissions trading}}, a limit on access to a resource (<b>the</b> <b>cap)</b> is defined and then allocated among users {{in the form of}} permits. Compliance is established by comparing actual emissions with permits surrendered including any permits traded within <b>the</b> <b>cap.</b> The environmental integrity of emissions trading is depends on the setting of <b>the</b> <b>cap,</b> not the decision to allow trading.|$|E
5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare {{usually has}} a single stem, but {{occasionally}} several stems arise from a thick common base. It attaches {{to the side of}} <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> and is cylindrical or slightly flattened with a bulbous base. Its surface is covered with hairy fibers (especially near the base), and its mature color is a dark chestnut brown. <b>The</b> <b>cap</b> is semicircular or kidney-shaped, flat on the lower surface and rounded on the top. The surface is at first much like the stem: covered with bristles and dark chestnut brown. However, it becomes smooth with maturity and can darken {{to the point of being}} almost black. <b>The</b> <b>cap</b> margin is usually buff to light brown–roughly the same color as the spines and lighter in color than the center. It becomes rolled inward (revolute) and often wavy in maturity. The spines on the underside of <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> are a few millimeters long and cylindrical down to their sharp tips. White to light brown when young, they later become covered with a white spore mass and then turn an ashy gray. Occasionally, fruit bodies are produced that lack a cap entirely.|$|E

5|$|Coprinopsis atramentaria is a {{cosmopolitan}} species that is roughly similar in size, color, and stature, {{but does not}} have patchy woolly tufts on <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> like C.variegata.|$|E
5|$|Even {{more similar}} {{is the very}} rare Lactarius semisanguifluus. Its milk also discolours within 5 to 8minutes to maroon. <b>The</b> <b>cap</b> of older fruit bodies is nearly {{completely}} greenish. It is also common under pines. The most similar and also the most closely related fungus is Lactarius fennoscandicus, a boreal to subalpine species. Its cap is distinctly zoned and brown-orange.

5|$|Fruit body {{primordia}} first appear {{between the}} scales of the cones, and require 9 to 35 days to reach their final height. They consist of an inner core of thin-walled generative hyphae enclosed by an outer coat of skeletal hyphae. Immature fruit bodies are white and delicate, but gradually become brown as they mature. Because <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> is grown from the stem tip after it bends, cap development interrupts stem growth, and this shift to centrifugal growth (that is, growth outward from the stem) results in the typical kidney-shaped or semicircular cap. Although the fruit body takes at least 9 days to mature, spores production begins within 48–72 hours of the start of cap growth. Spines start out as minute protuberances {{on the part of}} the stem adjoining the undersurface of <b>the</b> <b>cap.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> enlarges, these spines are spread horizontally, and more protuberances are formed, which elongate vertically downwards.|$|E
40|$|All positive-strand RNA viruses {{replicate}} their genomes {{in association}} with rearranged intracellular membranes such as single- or double-membrane vesicles. Brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNA synthesis occurs in vesicular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane invaginations, each induced by many copies of viral replication protein 1 a, which has N-terminal RNA capping and C-terminal helicase domains. Although <b>the</b> <b>capping</b> domain is responsible for 1 a membrane association and ER targeting, neither this domain nor the helicase domain was sufficient to induce replication vesicle formation. Moreover, despite their potential for mutual interaction, <b>the</b> <b>capping</b> and helicase domains showed no complementation when coexpressed in trans. Cross-linking showed that <b>the</b> <b>capping</b> and helicase domains each form trimers and larger multimers in vivo, and <b>the</b> <b>capping</b> domain formed extended, stacked, hexagonal lattices in vivo. Furthermore, coexpressing <b>the</b> <b>capping</b> domain blocked <b>the</b> ability of full-length 1 a to form replication vesicles and replicate RNA and recruited full-length 1 a into mixed hexagonal lattices with <b>the</b> <b>capping</b> domain. Thus, BMV replication vesicle formation and RNA replication depend on the direct linkage and concerted action of 1 a's self-interacting capping and helicase domains. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>capping</b> domain's strong dominant-negative effects showed that the ability of full-length 1 a to form replication vesicles was highly sensitive to disruption by non-productively titrating lattice-forming self-interactions of <b>the</b> <b>capping</b> domain. These and other findings {{shed light on the}} roles and interactions of 1 a domains in replication compartment formation and support prior results suggesting that 1 a induces replication vesicles by forming a capsid-like interior shell...|$|R
