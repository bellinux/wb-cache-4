5|$|Following his discharge, Statton {{settled in}} Fitzgerald, Tasmania, where he gained {{employment}} in <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> <b>industry.</b> True to her word {{that she would}} leave him if {{he went off to}} war, Statton's wife divorced him on 1 October 1920. Five years later, on 21 December 1925, he married Eliza Grace Hudson (née Parker) at the Registrar General's Office, Hobart. In 1934, severe bushfires broke out in the Derwent Valley, and Statton took a prominent role in rescue work aiding families isolated by the fire.|$|E
5|$|The papery bark of {{the white}} birch tree (Betula papyrifera) was used {{extensively}} by Native Americans. Wigwams were covered by it and canoes were constructed from it. Other uses included food containers, hunting and fishing equipment, musical instruments, toys and sledges. Nowadays, bark chips, a by-product of <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> <b>industry,</b> are used as a mulch and as a growing medium for epiphytic plants that need a soil-free compost.|$|E
50|$|Trees {{were also}} cut {{for use as}} fuel, amounting to a yearly 1.3 million cubic meters of wood a year. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> <b>industry's</b> poor logging {{techniques}} and inefficiency led to only 60% of <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> being used for profit.|$|R

Little, if any, prior relevant research had been undertaken in <b>the</b> Tasmanian <b>timber</b> <b>industry.</b> <b>The</b> study revealed the state of readiness of <b>the</b> Tasmanian <b>timber</b> <b>industry</b> to adopt electronic commerce, and recommended areas within the industry that had most potential for its introduction...|$|R
5|$|Northern Paiutes {{or their}} ancestors, who were hunter-gatherers, {{have lived in}} the region for {{thousands}} of years. Since the arrival of Euro-Americans in the 19thcentury, cattle ranching and other forms of agriculture have dominated land use in the area. In 1930, logging in the mountains north of Burns {{led to the creation of}} Hines, a lumber company town, and <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> <b>industry</b> remained important to the local economy until the 1990s. In addition to ranching, a variety of private and public enterprises support the Burns–Hines economy in the 21stcentury. Annual events include a migratory bird festival, the county fair, and a country music jamboree.|$|E
5|$|The {{road that}} became SR28 was paved around 1932, {{and has been}} used for flumes in <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> <b>industry</b> since 1880. The route first {{appeared}} in 1948, with the same general alignment as it has today. The highway gained fame for many years as the location of the Ponderosa Ranch, filming location of the television series Bonanza. On June 7, 1994, the Nevada Department of Transportation(NDOT) designated SR28 as a scenic byway, named North Shore Road. Later in September 1996, SR28 and part of US50 was designated as Lake Tahoe - Eastshore Drive, a National Scenic Byway.|$|E
5|$|Due to its unusual nature, both heavy {{snowfall}} {{and strong}} winds caused {{a swath of}} devastation stretching from the Mid-Atlantic states to northern New England. In the Middle-Atlantic region, moderate damage occurred at sea but little was noted inland. In New England, strong gusts inflicted significant damage to numerous churches. Widespread residential damage, in contrast, was mostly negligible and had no lasting consequences. Thousands of trees were knocked over, obstructing roads and fiscally damaging <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> <b>industry</b> throughout the region. Cold temperatures, wet snow, and high winds downed numerous branches in fruit orchards, froze potato crops, flattened dozens of barns, and killed over a hundred cattle. In general, the agriculture, shipping, timber, and livestock trades suffered most acutely following {{the passage of the}} snow hurricane, while structural damage was widespread but generally inconsequential.|$|E

5|$|Mayor West {{passes a}} law to legalize the drug, and {{everyone}} starts smoking it; the town has improved as a result, with milestones such as an increase in productivity {{and a decrease in}} crime. However, Lois's father, Carter, begins to lose money in <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> <b>industry</b> since hemp is being used to manufacture many products, particularly paper, and he bribes Peter to help him with an anti-marijuana campaign. Lois, however, points out that their methods are uninspired, explaining that Brian only succeeded because he was passionate about legalizing cannabis. Carter decides to bribe Brian to join his cause by publishing and shipping his novel, Faster Than the Speed of Love. Brian resists at first, but Stewie suggests he at least perform a number about the health risks of cannabis, since the book does not have enough merit to sell on its own. Brian reluctantly complies, and the drug becomes illegal once more.|$|E
5|$|Sabah's {{economy is}} mainly based on primary sector such as agriculture, {{forestry}} and petroleum. Currently, the tertiary sector {{plays an important}} part to the state economy, especially in tourism and services. With its richness in biodiversity, the state is offering ecotourism. Although {{in recent years the}} tourism industry has been affected by attacks and kidnapping of tourists by militant groups based in the southern Philippines, it remained stable with the increase of security in eastern Sabah and the Sulu Sea. The tourism sector contribute 10% share of the state GDP and was predicted to increase more. Majority of the tourists come from China (60.3%), followed by South Korea (33.9%), Australia (16.3%) and Taiwan (8.3%). Since the 1950s, rubber and copra are the main source of agricultural economy of North Borneo. <b>The</b> <b>timber</b> <b>industry</b> start to emerged in the 1960s due to high demand of raw materials from industrial countries. This was however replaced by petroleum in the 1970s after the discovery of oil in the area of west coast Sabah. In the same year, cocoa and palm oil was added to the list. The Sabah state government managed to increase the state fund from RM6million to RM12billion and poverty was down by almost half to 33.1% in 1980. The state rapid development on primary sector has attracted those job seekers in neighbouring Indonesia and the Philippines as the state labour force itself are not sufficient. The state Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at the time ranked behind Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, being the third richest although the manufacturing sector remained small. However, by 2000, the state started to become the poorest as it still dependent on natural resources as its primary sources of income comparing to those secondary sector producer states. Thus the Sabah Development Corridor (SDC) was established in 2008 by Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi with a total investment of RM105billion for 18 years to increase the state GDP to RM63.2billion by 2025. Around RM5.83billion were allocated each year for infrastructures development along with the creation of 900,000 jobs. The federal government targeted to eradicate hardcore poverty by the end Ninth Malaysia Plan (9MP) with overall poverty halved from 23% in 2004 to 12% in 2010 and 8.1% in 2012. Since its establishment in 2008, the state GDP increase to 10.7% which was higher than the national economic growth of 4.8% and the world economic growth of 2.7%. Following the world financial crisis in 2009, Sabah GDP recorded 4.8% growth compared to −1.5% for national level and −0.4% for world level.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>timber</b> <b>industry</b> {{was very}} {{profitable}} in the region, {{which has a}} very high occurrence rate of lightning strikes, so a series of lookouts was created to guard against fires.

With the development of <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> <b>industry</b> in the area, the station was also used as an office for the Forest Service timber sale administrator, which continued for the next 20-30 years. Over the years, the spring, as well as the meadows surrounding the cabin and barn were used by both cowboys and sheepherders driving their herds through the area. The station fell into disuse in the late 1940s or early 1950s.|$|E
