In the 1970s, the company was reorganized, and new production programs were established for particular types of <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> for production services.

50|$|Dr. Khargonekar’s {{research}} interests focus on systems and control theory and its applications. Control systems are ubiquitous in modern technological society. Airplanes, automobiles, manufacturing <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants,</b> chemical process plants, electric power grid, robots, biomedical devices, and heating and ventilation systems, among others, all contain control systems that ensure their suitable and desired operation. For example, flight control systems ensure airplane behavior during takeoff, cruise, and landing operations.Control theory {{is concerned with}} principles, techniques, and tools for analyzing and designing control systems. Often, these analysis and design procedures employ mathematical models of the system to be controlled based on relevant principles and laws from natural sciences. However, due to simplifying approximations and lack of complete knowledge, such mathematical models include errors and inaccuracies. Errors also arise due to inherent variability in manufacturing processes. Robust control is a subfield of control theory that addresses analysis and design processes and tools that can systematically and explicitly deal with modeling errors.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{globally}} set-up strategies, {{product development}} and manufacturing of today's companies are often {{connected to a}} high demand for cross-linking {{in order to synchronize}} and control complexity. This concerns processes within a company as well as beyond the borders of an enterprise. The cooperation with technical systems - in addition to cooperation structures characterized by human interaction - is promising for addressing this complexity. A prerequisite consists in an increasing virtualization of production systems, which are thereby equipped with partly autonomous decision-making authority and can be cross-linked consistently with the help of information technology. Models which describe the product - as a set target of manufacturing - and the means of production themselves are necessary to satisfy the aforementioned requirement. These models can be evaluated, for example, by model-based production control and manufacturing execution system approaches in order to enhance flexibility and productivity while simultaneously decreasing engineering costs. Furthermore, combined with innovative data feedback strategies, these models form a basis for efficient learning from processes, which leads to significant advantages in competition for producing companies, for manufacturers of machine <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> and service provider by improved mastering of processes, resources and process chains in production...|$|E

40|$|Light exerts {{two primary}} roles in <b>plant</b> growth <b>and</b> development. <b>Plants</b> acquire all {{biochemical}} energy required {{for growth and}} propagation solely from light energy via photosynthesis. In addition, light serves as a medium through which plants recognize environmental fluctuations, such as photoperiod and presence of neighboring animals <b>and</b> <b>plants.</b> Plants therefore constantly monitor the direction, intensity, duration, and wavelength of environmental light and integrate these light signals into the intrinsic regulatory programs to achieve an optimized growth in a given light condition. Although light regulates all aspects of <b>plant</b> growth <b>and</b> developmental aspects, the molecular mechanisms and signaling cascades involved have not been well established until recently.

It also delves into techniques for high-energy rate forming, such as gas generator technology, and it will be dedicating greater efforts to electromagnetic metal forming. Electromagnetic metal forming processes major potential for innovation and development in manufacturing car-body components since the benefits to be derived from this technique (such as extending the limitations of forming, enhancing spring back behavior, and delivering a high degree of flexibility in production) have this sector's key problems in mind. The Fraunhofer Institute for Machine <b>Tools</b> <b>and</b> Forming Technology focuses its research on coming up with technology, <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> strategies suitable for manufacturing medium-sized and large car-body components. There are two technological directions that IWU targets in this field of research. First of all, given the existing technical and physical process constraints, it is studying the possibilities of large-scale and partial deformation since both directions are of importance for the targeted products. However, these two approaches have very different requirements for designing <b>and</b> <b>tools.</b> The first approach forms components without preforming. Several forming steps are required for mapping typical car-body component shapes either with serial workstations or a flexible tool system. The partial electromagnetic metal forming approach means using integrated plant components, i. e. combining conventional press equipment with a magnetic forming plant. This can tap a potential that encompasses the technological benefits mentioned above while hiking productivity and scaling down the expenditures for investing in equipment...|$|R
