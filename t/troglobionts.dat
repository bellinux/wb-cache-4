40|$|Using species {{distribution}} data, {{we developed a}} georeferenced database of <b>troglobionts</b> (cave-obligate species) in Tennessee to examine spatial patterns of species richness and endemism, including > 2000 records for 200 described species. Forty aquatic <b>troglobionts</b> (stygobionts) and 160 terrestrial <b>troglobionts</b> are known from caves in Tennessee, the latter having the greatest diversity of any state in the United States. Endemism was high, with 25 % of terrestrial <b>troglobionts</b> (40 species) and 20 % of stygobionts (eight species) known from just a single cave and nearly two-thirds of all <b>troglobionts</b> (130 species) known from five or fewer caves. Species richness and endemism were greatest in the Interior Plateau (IP) and Southwestern Appalachians (SWA) ecoregions, which were twice {{as diverse as the}} Ridge and Valley (RV). Troglobiont species assemblages were most similar between the IP and SWA, which shared 59 species, whereas the RV cave fauna was largely distinct. We identified a hotspot of cave biodiversity with a center along the escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau in south-central Tennessee defined by both species richness and endemism that is contiguous with a previously defined hotspot in northeastern Alabama. Nearly half (91 species) of Tennessee's troglobiont diversity occurs in this region where several cave systems contain ten or more <b>troglobionts,</b> including one with 23 species. In addition, we identified distinct troglobiont communities across the state. These communities corresponded to hydrological boundaries and likely reflect past or current connectivity between subterranean habitats within and barriers between hydrological basins. Although diverse, Tennessee's subterranean fauna remains poorly studied and many additional species await discovery and description. We identified several undersampled regions and outlined conservation and management priorities to improve our knowledge and aid in protection of the subterranean biodiversity in Tennessee...|$|E

40|$|Cave-obligate organisms {{usually have}} smaller ranges and their assemblages have higher beta {{diversity}} than their epigean counterparts. Phylogenetic and functional diversity is usually low in cave communities, leading to taxonomic and functional disharmony, with entire groups {{missing from the}} subterranean realm. The objective of this work is to compare range, beta diversity, phylogenetic and functional diversity, taxonomic and functional disharmony of epigean versus <b>troglobiont</b> spiders in the Iberian Peninsula. The median extent of occurrence {{was found to be}} 33 times higher for epigean than for cave species. Beta diversity was significantly higher for <b>troglobiont</b> assemblages. Cave assemblages present lower phylogenetic and functional diversities than expected by chance. Taxonomic disharmony was noticeable, with many speciose families, namely Gnaphosidae, Salticidae and Lycosidae, absent in caves. Functional disharmony was equally high, with ambush hunters and sensing web weavers being absent in caves. The small range and high beta diversity of <b>troglobiont</b> spiders in the Iberian Peninsula is typical of many cave-obligate organisms, caused by the fragmentation and isolation of cave systems and the low vagility and high habitat specialization of species. Caves were colonized mainly by pre-adapted lineages, with high proportions of eutroglophile species. Some families no longer occur in surface habitats, possibly since the last glaciations, and currently are restricted to caves in the region. Few hunting strategies and web types are efficient in caves and these dominate among the <b>troglobiont</b> species. As <b>troglobiont</b> communities are of low alpha diversity, with low functional redundancy, have narrow ranges, present high levels of population fragmentation and are taxonomically unique, they should present higher proportions of imperilled species than epigean spiders in the Iberian Peninsula. Some species are probably endangered and require urgent conservation measures...|$|R
40|$|Most {{organisms are}} able to survive shorter or longer {{exposure}} to sub-zero temperatures. Hypothetically, trogloxenes characterized as not adapted, and troglophiles as not completely adapted to thermally stable subterranean environment, have retained or partially retained their ability to withstand freezing, while most <b>troglobionts</b> have not. We tested this hypothesis experimentally on 37 species inhabiting caves in Slovenia, analyzing their lower lethal temperatures in summer and winter, or for one season, if the species was not present in caves during both seasons. Specimens were exposed for 12 hrs to 1 °C-stepwise descending temperatures with 48 hr breaks. In general, the resistance to freezing was {{in agreement with the}} hypothesis, decreasing from trogloxenes over troglophiles to <b>troglobionts.</b> However, weak resistance was preserved in nearly all <b>troglobionts,</b> which responded in two ways. One group, withstanding freezing to a limited degree, and increasing freezing tolerance in winter, belong to the <b>troglobionts</b> inhabiting the superficial subterranean habitats. The other group, which equally withstand freezing in summer and winter, inhabit deep subterranean or other thermally buffered subterranean habitats. Data on cold resistance can thus serve as an efficient additional measure of adaptation to particular hypogean environments...|$|E
40|$|Terrestrial {{animals in}} {{subterranean}} habitats are often classified {{according to their}} degree of morphological or ecological specialization to the subterranean environment. The commonly held view is that, as distance into a cave increases, the frequency of morphologically specialized, i. e., troglomorphic, species or ecological specialization will increase. We tested this hypothesis for the fauna in 54 caves in Slovenia-the classical land for subterranean biology. We found that there exist two ecologically well separated terrestrial subsurface faunas: one shallow and one deep. 1) The shallow subterranean fauna, adapted to the terrestrial shallow subterranean habitats (SSHs) in the upper 10 m of subsurface strata, is most diverse. It consists of randomly distributed non-troglobionts and a major group of <b>troglobionts</b> adapted to the soil root zone. 2) The deep subterranean fauna is represented by a minor group of <b>troglobionts,</b> adapted to caves. <b>Troglobionts</b> are strictly divided between the two faunas. There is strong evidence that in karstic ecosystems with deep-rooted vegetation {{this might be a}} global pattern, or that in these locations only the shallow subterranean fauna exist...|$|E

40|$|The Judbarra / Gregory Karst Region is {{situated}} in the Judbarra / Gregory National Park, west of Timber Creek, Northern Territory. Several large joint controlled maze caves occur within the area, developed within and below a prominent dolomitic layer (the Supplejack Member). The caves are predominantly shallow in depth (< 15 m below the surface) but are occasionally developed deeper as multi-level systems, reaching the aquifer. Two biological surveys from the largest caves have revealed 56 morphospecies from 43 families, 19 orders, and 7 classes. All collecting was undertaken in the northern dry season (April to September) and consisted predominantly of opportunistic collecting. The diversity of invertebrates collected from the Judbarra / Gregory karst comprised non-troglobionts (48 species, 86 %), <b>troglobionts</b> (5 species, 9 %), stygobionts (2 species, 3 %), and trogloxenes (1 species, 2 %). Five of the species {{are considered to be}} potential <b>troglobionts,</b> and two potential stygobionts as indicated by troglomorphisms such as elongate appendages and reduced or absent eyes. The five troglobiont species are an isopod (Platyarthridae: Trichorhina sp.), a scorpion (Buthidae: Lychas? sp. nov.), a pseudoscorpion (Geogarypidae: Geogarypus sp. nov.), a millipede (Polydesmida: sp.), and a planthopper (Meenoplidae: sp.). The two stygobiont species are a hydrobiid snail (Hydrobiidae: sp.), and an amphipod (Amphipoda: sp.).

The cavernicolous fauna of Sphaeroceridae in the Czech Republic is surveyed and its members (15 species) are classified according to their affiliation to the cave milieu.

40|$|Subterranean aquatic {{habitats}} may be {{of particular}} interest from the zoological point of view. Most of the studies dealing with aquatic troglobiont fauna focus on <b>troglobionts,</b> such as organisms spending their entire life cycle in caves.

The focus {{of this paper is}} on identifying the role played by cave features in the occurrence of aquatic troglobiont fauna and assessing the relationship between species with and without troglomorphic features and their cave habitat requirements. Organisms’ occurrence and environmental features were assessed during a repeated survey of all the caves occurring in a karstic valley of north-western Italy. We surveyed 39 natural caves from March to December 2013 sampling the waterbodies inside them for fire salamander larvae and invertebrates occurrence. 11 aquatic taxa were recorded during this study including 2 aquatic troglobiont species, Niphargus ambulator Karaman, 1975 and Dendrocoelum sp. n. All the taxa did not occur randomly. Aquatic <b>troglobionts</b> preferred deep and dark caves while other non obligate cave dweller occurred in shallower and brighter caves. The most important variables assessing distribution within caves were distance from the entrance and the temperature variation range of the pools.

40|$|Seasonality in surface weather {{results in}} {{seasonal}} {{temperature and humidity}} changes in caves. Ecological and physiological differences among trogloxenes, troglophiles, and <b>troglobionts</b> result in species-dependent responses to this variability. To investigate these responses, we conducted five biological inventories in a marble cave in the Sierra Nevada Range, California, USA between May and December 2010. The cave was divided into six quadrats and temperature was continuously logged in each (humidity was logged at the entrance and in the deep cave). With increasing distance from the entrance, temperature changes were increasingly attenuated and lagged relative to surface temperature. Linear regressions were created to determine the relationship between measured environmental variables and diversity for cavernicoles (<b>troglobionts</b> and troglophiles) and trogloxenes cave– wide and in the transition zone. Diversity for cavernicoles and trogloxenes peaked in the entrance and deep cave zones, respectively. Quadrat, date, 2 -week antecedent temperature average, 2 -week antecedent temperature range, and trogloxene abundance explained 76 % of cavernicole diversity variability. Quadrat explained 55 % of trogloxene diversity variability. In the transition zone, trogloxene abundance explained 26 % of cavernicole variability and 2 -week antecedent temperature and 2 -week antecedent temperature range explained 40 % of trogloxene variability. In the transition zone, trogloxene diversity was inversely related to 2 -week antecedent temperature average and 2 -week antecedent temperature range, suggesting that species were moving into the transition zone when temperature was most stable. In a CCA of cavernicoles distribution data and environmental variables, 35 % of variation in species-specific distributions was attributable to quadrat, and non-significant percentages were explained by date and environmental variables. Differences in assemblage structure among quadrats were largely due to differences between distributions of trogloxenes and cavernicoles, but responses varied among species. Differences are likely due to ecological niche width, physiological constraints, and competition...|$|E
