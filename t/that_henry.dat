5|$|A late 15th century legenda nova claimed <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> {{had come}} to Sweden in the retinue of papal legate Nicholas Breakspear, the later Pope Adrian IV, and {{appointed}} as the Bishop of Uppsala by him. Even though legenda nova states 1150 as {{the year of the}} crusade, it is certain from other sources that Nicholas really was in Sweden in 1153. It is not known whether this was just an inference by the writer, {{based on the fact that}} also Nicholas was an Englishman. However, there is no information about anyone called as Henry accompanying the legate in any source describing the visit, nor him appointing a new bishop in Uppsala. Another claim by legenda nova was <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> was translated to Turku cathedral already in 1154, which certainly was false since the cathedral was built only in the 1290s. In the late 16th century, Bishop Paulus Juusten claimed <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> had been the Bishop of Uppsala for two years before the crusade. Based on these postulates, early 20th-century historians assembled 1155 as the year of the crusade and 1156 as the year of Henry's death. Historians from different centuries have also suggested various other years from 1150 to 1158.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of this confrontation, Henry {{unexpectedly}} fell ill and died near Lyons-la-Forêt. It is uncertain what, if anything, Henry said about the succession before his death. Contemporary chronicler accounts were coloured by subsequent events. Sources favourable to Matilda suggested <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> had reaffirmed his intent to grant all his lands to his daughter, while hostile chroniclers argued <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> had renounced his former plans and had apologised for having forced the barons to swear an oath of allegiance to her.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December 2014, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> had left the Red Bulls after four-and-a-half years at the club. On 16 December, he announced his retirement {{as a player and}} stated that he would begin working for Sky Sports as a pundit.|$|E
50|$|Henry's defence {{of divine}} {{illumination}} was strongly criticised by the Franciscan theologian Duns Scotus, who argued <b>that</b> <b>Henry's</b> {{version of the}} theory led to scepticism.|$|R
50|$|Whichever {{version is}} correct, all sources agree <b>that</b> <b>Henry's</b> grandfather, Sir William Norris, had {{taken part in}} the Battle of Stoke Field on 16 June 1487 at the {{conclusion}} of the Wars of the Roses.|$|R
50|$|Ultimately, {{the film}} as {{produced}} mentions James several times. His unlikely bio is briefly recapped, and Billy Beane is depicted telling John <b>Henry</b> <b>that</b> <b>Henry's</b> hiring of James is the reason Beane {{is interested in the}} Red Sox general manager job.|$|R
5|$|Several Acts of Parliament then followed. The Act in Conditional Restraint of Annates {{proposed}} that the clergy pay no more than 5% of their first year's revenue (annates) to Rome. This was initially controversial, and required <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> visit the House of Lords three times to browbeat the Commons.|$|E
5|$|Some sources claim <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> was canonized in 1158, {{but this}} {{information}} has been traced to a late publication by Johannes Vastovius in 1623 and is generally regarded as a fabrication.|$|E
5|$|Alexander was a {{supporter}} of Gilbert of Sempringham's new monastic order of the Gilbertines, {{and he was also}} known as a patron of literature. He commissioned Geoffrey of Monmouth to compose the Prophecies of Merlin, which Geoffrey dedicated to him. Alexander was a patron of the medieval chronicler Henry of Huntingdon, and requested <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> write his historical work.|$|E
50|$|The hunters return, and {{are singing}} happily, but their joy is cut short when a {{messenger}} arrives to say <b>that</b> <b>Henry's</b> armies are marching on Wales, {{and that the}} Prince of Wales has issued a call to arms to defend the country.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a moment}} of intense anxiety, and it must be confessed <b>that</b> <b>Henry's</b> heart almost stopped beating. The warrior with the torch held the light aloft, and all in the party gazed around with eyes as {{piercing}} as those of some wild beasts.|$|R
50|$|His {{father died}} {{at some point}} in 1506; in November <b>that</b> year, <b>Henry</b> Scrope {{received}} livery of his inheritance on 15 November <b>that</b> year. <b>Henry</b> VIII was crowned King of England on 23 June 1509, and at which occasion Henry Scrope was made a Knight Banneret.|$|R
5|$|General Tilney {{returns home}} from a trip away and orders Eleanor to send Catherine home to Fullerton that night. Catherine endures the trip alone and {{believes}} <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> told the General about her suspicions. A few days later, Henry comes to Fullerton and explains that the General discovered that Catherine's family were not as rich as John led him to believe. He apologises for his father's actions and explains that even though he will probably be disinherited, he loves Catherine and proposes. Catherine accepts and the couple marry.|$|E
5|$|His loyalty {{the crown}} {{was such that}} in 1460 the Yorkists proclaimed him {{one of their most}} mortal enemies among the king's supporters. They also claimed that Beaumont, along with the earls of Wiltshire and Shrewsbury, orchestrated the Yorkists' {{attainder}} at the 1459 Coventry parliament, in order to seize the Yorkists' lands. It is likely that they were the public focus of the Yorkists' enmity in a way <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> VI's queen (to whom he was a personal adviser), Margaret of Anjou could not be.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Monaco sent scout Arnold Catalano {{to watch}} Henry, {{then at the}} age of 13 in a match. Henry scored all six goals as his side won 6–0. Catalano asked him to join Monaco without even {{attending}} a trial first. Catalano requested <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> complete a course at the elite Clairefontaine academy, and despite the director's reluctance to admit Henry due to his poor school results, he was allowed to complete the course and joined Arsène Wenger's Monaco as a youth player. Subsequently, Henry signed professional forms with Monaco, and made his professional debut on 31 August 1994, in a 2–0 loss against Nice. Although Wenger suspected <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> should be deployed as a striker, he put Henry on the left wing because he believed that his pace, natural ball control and skill would be more effective against full backs than centre-backs.|$|E
50|$|The victorious {{conclusion}} of Agincourt, from the English viewpoint, {{was only the}} first step in the campaign to recover the French possessions that he felt belonged to the English crown. Agincourt also held out the promise <b>that</b> <b>Henry's</b> pretensions to the French throne might be realised.|$|R
50|$|The novel {{begins when}} Henry Pulling, a {{conventional}} and uncharming bank manager {{who has taken}} early retirement, meets his septuagenarian Aunt Augusta {{for the first time}} in over fifty years at his mother's funeral. Despite having little in common, they form a bond. On their first meeting, Augusta tells <b>Henry</b> <b>that</b> his mother was not truly his mother and we learn <b>that</b> <b>Henry's</b> father has been dead for more than 40 years.|$|R
50|$|He {{was printed}} by Wynkyn de Worde and Richard Pynson; his almanac {{is said to}} be the first printed in English. The one for the year 1500 survives. His {{prediction}} <b>that</b> <b>Henry’s</b> queen would live to age 80 backfired when she died young, and he left the court.|$|R
5|$|It {{is a sign}} of Edward's {{high regard}} for Lancaster that he would bestow such {{extensive}} privileges on him. The two men were second cousins through their great-grandfather Henry III and practically coeval (Edward was born in 1312), so it is natural to assume that a strong sense of camaraderie existed between them. Another factor that might have influenced the king's decision was the fact <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> had no male heir, so the grant was made for the Earl's lifetime only, and not intended to be hereditary.|$|E
5|$|King Henry's Mound, a Neolithic burial barrow, is {{the highest}} point within the park and is located within the public gardens of Pembroke Lodge. At various times the mound's name has been {{connected}} with Henry VIII or with his father Henry VII. But {{there is no evidence}} to support the legend <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> VIII stood on the mound to watch for a sign from St Paul's that Anne Boleyn had been executed at the Tower and that he was then free to marry Jane Seymour.|$|E
5|$|Knox {{knew that}} the Queen Regent would ask for help from France. So he {{negotiated}} by letter under the assumed name John Sinclair with William Cecil, Elizabeth's chief adviser, for English support. Knox sailed secretly to Lindisfarne, off the northeast coast of England {{at the end of}} July, to meet James Croft and Sir Henry Percy at Berwick upon Tweed. Knox was indiscreet and news of his mission soon reached Mary of Guise. He returned to Edinburgh telling Croft he had to return to his flock, and suggested <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> Balnaves should go to Cecil.|$|E
5000|$|The Court ruled (4-3) <b>that</b> <b>Henry's</b> conduct was {{contributory}} infringement, in {{a decision}} written by Justice Lurton, joined by Justices McKenna, Holmes, and Van Devanter. Chief Justice Edward White, joined by Justices Hughes and Lamar, dissented. (Two justices were unavailable: Justice Harlan had died and Justice Day was absent.).|$|R
60|$|Yet {{in spite}} of this ebullition, which had greatly exasperated Dr. May, there was every {{probability}} <b>that</b> <b>Henry's</b> consent might be wrung out or dispensed with, and plans of attack were being arranged at the tea-table, when a new obstacle {{in the shape of a}} note from Leonard himself.|$|R
2500|$|Henry often {{served as}} host at Hanover Tavern {{as part of}} his duties, and entertained the guests by playing the fiddle. Among those who stayed there during this time was the young Thomas Jefferson, aged 17, en route to his studies at the College of William and Mary, and who later wrote that he became well acquainted with Henry then, despite their age {{difference}} of six years. Jefferson in 1824 told Daniel Webster, [...] "Patrick Henry was originally a bar-keeper", a characterization <b>that</b> <b>Henry's</b> biographers have found to be unfair. William Wirt, Henry's earliest biographer, rejected Jefferson's suggestion <b>that</b> <b>Henry's</b> profession then was a bartender, but noted it would have been [...] "very natural in Mr. Henry's situation" [...] to do what was necessary to ensure that guests were properly seen to.|$|R
5|$|Prince Henry {{showed no}} {{interest}} in Catherine as a wife; instead, he openly took mistresses. For the first ten years of the marriage, Catherine failed to produce any children. In 1537, Philippa Duci, one of Henry's mistresses, {{gave birth to a}} daughter, whom he publicly acknowledged. This proved <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> was fertile and added to the pressure on Catherine to produce a child.|$|E
5|$|Subtle persuasions by the Princess of Wales and the Crown Princess of Prussia, who {{reminded}} her {{mother of the}} happiness that Beatrice had brought the Prince Consort, induced the Queen to resume talking to Beatrice. Queen Victoria consented to the marriage on condition <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> give up his German commitments and live permanently with Beatrice and the Queen.|$|E
5|$|Success {{finally arrived}} during the 2001–02 season. Arsenal {{finished}} seven points above Liverpool {{to win the}} Premier League title, and defeated Chelsea 2–0 in the FA Cup Final. Henry became the league's top goalscorer and netted 32 goals in all competitions as he led Arsenal to a double and his first silverware with the club. There was much expectation <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> would replicate his club form for France during the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but the defending champions suffered a shock exit at the group stage.|$|E
50|$|This episode {{begins by}} {{explaining}} <b>that</b> <b>Henry's</b> favourite place on Sodor is a forest {{through which the}} line runs. He likes to stop here and admire the scenery. A storm damages the forest, making Henry sad. The episode ends happily, with new trees being planted to replace the ones lost.|$|R

5|$|The film {{opens with}} Sir John Falstaff and Justice Shallow {{walking through the}} snow, then to a warm fire inside the Boar's Head Tavern, as the two reminisce. After a main credit sequence, the narrator {{explains}} that King Henry IV of England has succeeded Richard II, whom he has killed. Richard II's true heir, Edmund Mortimer, is a prisoner in Wales, and Mortimer's cousins Northumberland, Worcester, and Northumberland's son Hotspur demand <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> rescue Mortimer. The king refuses, and thus Mortimer's cousins begin to plot Henry's overthrow.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Archie follows {{through on}} Regina's warning by convincing Henry that {{the fairy tale}} stories are not real, {{upsetting}} Henry. This prompts Emma to {{pay a visit to}} Archie as she figures out that Regina was responsible for threatening him. Emma accuses Regina of threatening Archie, but Regina says <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> is missing again. Archie conjectures <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> may have gone back to the mine shaft. There, Henry begins to investigate the area and comes across a glass item similar to the one Regina found earlier that he puts into his backpack. Archie goes in to search for Henry and finds the boy, but as they try to escape, an aftershock blocks off the main entrance, leaving an injured Archie and Henry trapped. They find an elevator shaft, not knowing that above ground Emma and Regina have taken the suggestion of blasting the main entrance from Marco (Tony Amendola), which results in the elevator carrying Henry and Archie being lowered even further after the blast takes place.|$|E
5|$|Theobald was consecrated on 8 January 1139 by the legate, Alberic of Ostia. He went to Rome for his pallium {{and took}} part in the Second Lateran Council. As {{archbishop}} his behaviour was less political in comparison to that of his main rival, Henry of Blois. Henry was appointed a papal legate on 1 March 1139, which meant <b>that</b> <b>Henry</b> could now call church councils in England and had power equal to or exceeding that of Theobald. Theobald swore fealty to Stephen upon his election to Canterbury, recognising Stephen as the king of England.|$|E
50|$|Henry the Lion, who {{descended from}} the Counts of Northeim via his mother, seized Homburg castle. On 13 October 1152, at a Diet in Würzburg, the emperor also granted Herman's {{possessions}} from the Reinhausen side to Herny the Lion; Henry's claim {{was based on the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>Henry's</b> maternal great-grandmother had been a sister of Herman's greatgrandfather.|$|R
5000|$|Critics Susan Gerbic, Hemant Mehta, Steven Novella, Sharon Hill, David Gorski, Mark Edward, Ryan Houlihan, and Bobby Finger {{maintain}} <b>that</b> <b>Henry's</b> readings {{are performed}} using deceptive cold and hot reading techniques, and not [...] "psychic" [...] powers. They also criticize his TV show for targeting {{people who are}} grieving and vulnerable, and exploiting them for entertainment.|$|R
