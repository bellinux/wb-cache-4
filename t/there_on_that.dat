5|$|On 21 June 2009, Schumacher {{appeared}} on the BBC's motoring programme Top Gear as the Stig. Presenter Jeremy Clarkson hinted later in the programme that Schumacher was not the regular Stig, and the BBC has since confirmed {{that this is the}} case. Schumacher was <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> occasion because Ferrari would not allow anyone else to drive the one-of-a-kind black Ferrari FXX that was featured in the show. The FXX was presented to Schumacher upon his retirement at Monza in 2006.|$|E

Also {{during the same}} year Periyar's ancestral home in Erode, was dedicated as a commemoration building. On 20 February 1977, the opening function of Periyar Building in Madras was held.

25|$|Sun Ce's younger brother, Sun Quan, favoured Zhou Tai so he {{requested}} for Zhou {{to be transferred}} to his unit. Once, when Sun Ce was away on a campaign against some bandits who had emerged in the six counties of Kuaiji, Sun Quan was left in Xuancheng County (宣城縣; present-day Xuancheng, Anhui) with less than 1,000 men. Out of negligence, Sun Quan did not set up defence posts, so when thousands of bandits suddenly attacked Xuancheng, he attempted to flee. However, by then, Sun Quan had already been surrounded by the bandits, who attacked him and slashed at his saddle, causing much panic among his men. Only Zhou Tai, with his spirits roused, rushed to protect Sun Quan, emboldening those near him and making them able to fight again. When the bandits finally dispersed, Zhou Tai had sustained 12 deep wounds all over his body and he {{took a long time to}} recover. If Zhou Tai was not <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> day, Sun Quan would have surely perished. Zhou Tai's act of bravery was greatly appreciated by Sun Ce, who appointed him as the Chief (長) of Chungu County (春穀縣; northwest of present-day Fanchang County, Anhui).|$|E
25|$|The equites and two senators, Quintus Hortensius and Gaius Scribonius Curio {{supported}} Cicero. They assembled on the Capitol {{and sent}} envoys to the consuls {{and the senate}} on his behalf. Lucius Ninnius tried to rally popular support. However, Clodius prevented him from taking any action. Aulus Gabinius barred the equites from accessing the senate, drove one of them who was persistent {{out of the city}} and rebuked Quintus Hortensius and Gaius Curio. Calpurnius Piso advised Cicero that leaving Rome was the only way for him to be safe. Cicero took offence. Caesar condemned the illegality of the action taken in 63 BC, but did not approve the punishment proposed by the law because it was not fitting for any law to deal with past events. Crassus had shown some support through his son, but he sided with the people. Pompey promised help, but he kept making excuses and kept making journeys out of Rome. Cicero got scared, considered resorting to arms and slighted Pompey openly. However, he was stopped by Cato and Hortensius, for fear of a civil war. Cicero left for Sicily, where he had been a governor, hoping to find sympathy <b>there.</b> <b>On</b> <b>that</b> day the law was passed without opposition. It was supported even by people who had actively helped Cicero. His property was confiscated and his house was demolished. Then Clodius carried a law that specified the terms of Cicero’s banishment. This banned him from a radius of 500 miles from Rome and both he and those who harboured him could be killed with impunity. Therefore, he went to Greece.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of series two, Shakespeare was still missing and {{believed}} dead. Thomas Flower of the Kalahari Meerkat Project explained the lack of certainty by noting that [...] "...meerkats are often killed defending pups, Shakespeare was a babysitter {{the day before and}} Lazuli were in the area. However it is equally possible that he was killed by a predator, dispersed to another group, or was killed by another group whilst trying to join them, we just weren't <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> particular day." [...] More recent articles discussing Flower's death refer to Shakespeare's death and reiterate that his body has never been found.|$|E

500|$|In Puerto Rico {{there are}} no monuments to commemorate the Spanish–American War as such. There are various markers {{where some of the}} {{historical}} events took place and some tombstones which honor both the American invaders and the Spanish and Puerto Rican defenders of the island. In the town of Guánica there is a rock on the coastal port with an inscription indicating that Major General Nelson A. Miles and his men landed on that spot. There is also a monument in the town dedicated to the veterans of the Spanish–American War, however said monument fails to specify to which veterans it is dedicated to, the Americans or the Spanish/Puerto Ricans. In Yauco there is a monument/tombstone dedicated to an unknown Spanish soldier who had fallen in combat and was left <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> very spot. In Coamo there are two markers that indicate where Rafael Martínez Illescas and Frutos López died. López's tomb is located in the old cemetery of Coamo next to that of the tomb of the three unknown Puerto Rican soldiers who perished in that conflict. Martínez Illescas' body was transferred in 1916, to his hometown Cartagena in Spain where he is buried. The town of Guayama has a monument dedicated {{to the members of the}} 4th Ohio Infantry. In Asomante, there is a marker which indicates the place where the [...] "Battle of Asomante" [...] took place.|$|E
500|$|Gilbert Adair, {{writing in}} a review for Full Metal Jacket, commented that [...] "Kubrick's {{approach}} to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression". Johnson notes that although Kubrick was a [...] "visual filmmaker", he also loved words and was like a writer in his approach, very sensitive to the story itself, which he found unique. Before shooting began, Kubrick tried to have the script as complete as possible, but still allowed himself enough space to make changes during the filming, finding it [...] "more profitable to avoid locking up any ideas about staging or camera or even dialogue prior to rehearsals" [...] as he put it. Kubrick told Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "I {{think you have to}} view the entire problem of putting the story you want to tell up <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> light square. It begins with the selection of the property; it continues through the creation of the story, the sets, the costumes, the photography and the acting. And when the picture is shot, it's only partially finished. I think the cutting is just a continuation of directing a movie. I think the use of music effects, opticals and finally main titles are all part of telling the story. And I think the fragmentation of these jobs, by different people, is a very bad thing". Kubrick also said: [...] "I think that the best plot is no apparent plot. I like a slow start, the start that gets under the audience's skin and involves them so that they can appreciate grace notes and soft tones and don't have to be pounded over the head with plot points and suspense tools." ...|$|E
