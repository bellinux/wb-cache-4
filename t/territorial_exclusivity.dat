5000|$|WKBD is {{available}} on many cable systems in Southeast Michigan, Southwestern Ontario and Northwest Ohio. Outside of the Detroit area, however, most programming on WKBD is subject to <b>territorial</b> syndication <b>exclusivity</b> restrictions placed on cable providers by the local broadcast rights holders to certain syndicated programs. During the affected programming, cable systems either switch to a feed from another channel, or run an on-screen text notice acknowledging the blacked out programming (such as [...] "This channel is being blacked out due to FCC regulations"). In Canada, some programs {{may be subject to}} simultaneous substitution.|$|R
50|$|The LSWR {{was now in}} {{possession}} of a shorter and more efficient route to Portsmouth. But the line from Havant to Portcreek Junction was over the LBSCR, and from there to Portsmouth the line was joint. There was a long-standing traffic pooling agreement with the LBSCR and worse, there was a <b>territorial</b> <b>exclusivity</b> agreement.|$|E
50|$|The club began {{offering}} membership in August 2014, but {{a bid to}} join the National Premier Soccer League (NPSL) for the spring 2015 campaign was blocked by San Francisco Stompers FC, who claimed <b>territorial</b> <b>exclusivity</b> in the league. SF City filed a grievance with US Soccer contesting the Stompers' claim. An independent arbiter eventually sided with SF City, {{but by the time}} the decision was made the club had already agreed to join the US Club Soccer NorCal Premier Soccer League.|$|E
50|$|A radius clause {{is a form}} of non-compete clause used in {{the live}} music industry, in which a tour {{promoter}} stipulates that a performer, for a certain length of time prior to or following an appearance at a concert or festival, must not hold concerts at other locations within a certain radius of the city where they are to perform. In essence, it gives the promoter a form of <b>territorial</b> <b>exclusivity,</b> ensuring that the performer does not book concerts with competing promoters and venues in nearby areas, which can undermine ticket sales for their main event.|$|E
50|$|All of the {{top four}} major leagues grant some sort of <b>territorial</b> <b>exclusivity</b> to their owners, precluding the {{addition}} of another team {{in the same area}} unless the current team's owners consent, which is generally obtained in exchange for compensation, residual rights, or both. For example, to obtain the consent of Baltimore Orioles to place an MLB team in Washington (about 35 mi away), a deal was struck under the terms of which television and radio broadcast rights to Nationals games are handled by the Orioles franchise. Regarding territorial rights, the main concern for many team owners is television revenue, although the possibility of reduced ticket sales remains a concern for some teams. Because the National Football League shares all of its television revenue equally, and most of its teams sell out their stadiums, some NFL owners are seen as less reluctant to share their territories. For example, the return of the NFL to Baltimore in 1996 attracted no serious opposition from the Washington Redskins organization.|$|E
50|$|At {{this time}} it was {{realised}} everywhere that railways were needed to connect with the beginnings of a national network. High dividend distributions among the earlier companies provoked a vast number of railway schemes, {{at a time when it}} was believed that any district could only support a single railway, and the frenzy this created is known as the railway mania. At the same time, the Great Western Railway (GWR) and its ally the B&ER were built using the broad gauge, while nearly all large competing companies used the standard gauge (often referred to as the narrow gauge in contrast). If a new independent local scheme was being promoted, securing its chosen gauge to be broad or narrow also secured its allegiance to one or the other of the larger companies, and in turn this might secure further <b>territorial</b> <b>exclusivity</b> for the winner. This continuing process became known as the gauge wars.|$|E
5000|$|Things {{got so bad}} for The Baseball Network {{that even}} local {{broadcasters}} objected to its operations. KSMO-TV in Kansas City, the primary over-the-air station for the Kansas City Royals, {{went as far as}} to sue the Royals for breach of contract resulting from their broadcasts being [...] "overexposed" [...] and violating its <b>territorial</b> <b>exclusivity.</b> Worse yet, even if a market had only one team, the ABC or NBC affiliate could still not broadcast that team's game if the start time was not appropriate for the time zone. For example, if the Detroit Tigers (the only team in their market) played a road game in Seattle, Oakland or Anaheim beginning at 8:00 p.m. Pacific Time (a late game), Detroit's Baseball Network affiliate (either WXYZ-TV or WDIV, depending on the network which held the rights to the game) could not air the game because the start time was too late for the Detroit area (11:00 p.m. Eastern Time). Detroit viewers only had the option of viewing the early game of the night.|$|E
50|$|Minor League Baseball is a {{hierarchy}} of professional baseball leagues in the United States that compete at levels below Major League Baseball (MLB) and provide opportunities for player development {{and a way to}} prepare for the major leagues. All of the minor leagues are operated as independent businesses. Most are members of the umbrella organization known as Minor League Baseball (MiLB), which operates under the Commissioner of Baseball within the scope of organized baseball, a seven-tier league hierarchy (eight when Major League Baseball is included as the top tier) that classifies leagues by level of development. The highest level of minor league baseball, Triple-A, features high level major league prospects almost ready to join the majors playing in large cities without MLB franchises, while each successively lower class (Double-A, A-Advanced, Class A, Short Season A, Rookie-Advanced and Rookie) features players with correspondingly less experience and, generally, playing in smaller markets. Additionally, several independent baseball leagues, which do not have any official links to Major League Baseball, also operate, with varying quality of competition, some in suburban communities too close to affiliated baseball teams to avoid <b>territorial</b> <b>exclusivity.</b>|$|E
50|$|New Jersey {{has only}} two English {{speaking}} commercial television stations: Secaucus-licensed WWOR-TV (channel 9) and Wildwood-licensed WMGM-TV (channel 40), an NBC affiliate until the start of 2015 (currently an independent station). Both stations no longer have news departments or local newscasts. WMGM-TV covers the outer fringes of the Delaware Valley and Philadelphia, while WWOR-TV primarily serves the New York Tri-State Area. On July 2, 2013, traditional newscasts (which were nominally focused on New Jersey issues) on WWOR were discontinued for an outside produced interview program called Chasing New Jersey, which later took on a generic social media focus under the title Chasing News with only a vague focus on New Jerseyan issues. WMGM-TV ended their NBC affiliation on January 1, 2015 due to NBCUniversal parent Comcast exercising <b>territorial</b> <b>exclusivity</b> for the Philadelphia/Atlantic City market with their O&O WCAU. The news department was also terminated, though it remains under contract to the owners which sold off the station license, and they may relaunch it on another station. PBS member network NJTV is the only remaining television operation with a New Jersey-focused newscast, but was converted to private ownership from state backing in July 2011 under Chris Christie's campaign promises to cut state expenses, and is currently operated by WNET.org out of New York (though ironically licensed to Newark, NJ), which also airs the NJTV newscasts on WNET itself for Northern New Jersey. Smaller independent stations such as WMBC-TV, WMGM-TV and WACP also have newscasts to serve local audiences of Northern and Southern New Jersey, respectively, except WMBC-TV's news also focuses on New York and Fairfield County, Connecticut.|$|E

40|$|Most of {{the thesis}} will {{concentrate}} on the two jurisdictions in which the franchise method is already well established, the European Economic Community (EEC) and the United States (US). The first chapter of this thesis is a general introduction to the franchise method and its main characteristics and features. Also included, is {{an introduction to the}} different types of franchise specific legislation. In the second chapter, the development of the approach taken towards the franchise method in the EEC is examined. The chapter includes an analysis of the Court of Justice's (COJ) well-known Pronuptia judgment, the EEC individual exemptions for franchise agreements issued by the EEC Commission and the Commission's franchise regulation. The first part of the third chapter, deals with the antitrust law in the US to the extent it concerns franchise agreements. The second part of the third chapter examines franchise legislation to protect franchises in the US, both at the federal and at the state level. The study in both parts of the third chapter is done through concentrating in the status of <b>territorial</b> <b>exclusivity.</b> The fourth and last chapter presents broad comparisons and general conclusions.

40|$|A global water {{crisis is}} {{emerging}} that may challenge states’ existing and future water availability. With countries already heavily reliant on international rivers, {{the issue of}} managing water scarcity in these basins is mounting. An already complex issue due to climatic change {{and the politics of}} access, the management of water resources is complicated further by sovereignty. In a context shaped by political boundaries and a concomitant <b>territorial</b> <b>exclusivity,</b> nation-states seek to guarantee their societies’ water by exerting control through physical and institutional infrastructure. Yet, the basin’s hydrological interdependency implies co-riparian countries remain vulnerable to each other’s use of the shared river, suggesting ecological rather than just political limits to sovereignty. The continued vulnerability, as envisaged within the greening of sovereignty, suggests international cooperation is necessary. Explained as sovereignty bargains, in which states trade reduced autonomy for future benefits, international cooperation is, we suggest, bi-directional and can stem from or create international institutions. We examine an instance of international cooperation that exemplifies an alternative approach to international river management. The benefit-sharing principle focuses on allocating the outputs from water use, rather than the water itself; and was used by the Senegal basin riparians to access key services such as electricity despite a context of poverty, climatic change and intra-basin politics. What emerges is a strong narrative of cooperation sustained, over decades, by the states’ willingness to engage in sovereignty bargains...|$|E
