50|$|Typically, {{adjustments}} {{in respect of}} prior years arise because the tax calculations made for the statutory accounts (which need only be materially correct, and are prepared in a tight time frame to meet the accounts filing deadline) differ from those done for the filing of the tax return (typically done later in the year, with much greater thoroughness). This difference is therefore included in the <b>tax</b> <b>expense</b> line in the following year’s accounts. Other reasons for prior year elements to the <b>tax</b> <b>expense</b> may be where a past income tax return was re-submitted with a different tax result (either because the taxpayer elected to, or because {{they were forced to}} by a tax authority who disagreed with the original filing). In any case, having {{adjustments in}} respect of prior years is a standard part of the <b>tax</b> <b>expense</b> item, and should not be considered a misstatement in the original accounts - the <b>tax</b> <b>expense</b> item is not being restated.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} whether the Deferred <b>Tax</b> <b>Expenses</b> analysis can be employed to detect earnings management in Indonesian Capital Market. This study also compares the deferred <b>tax</b> <b>expenses</b> method and the accrual method as the proxy of Earnings Management. This study finds that deferred <b>tax</b> <b>expenses</b> and the accrual measures (using Total Accruals model, Modified Jones Model and Forward Looking Model) have positive and significant impacts on the probability of earnings management to avoid losses. It means that the bigger the value of Accrual and Deferred <b>Tax</b> <b>Expenses</b> the bigger the probability of earnings management practices. Of the three models used, the deferred Jax expenses variable has similar significances compared to total accrual model and higher significances compared to the discretionary accrual models. This shown that deferred <b>tax</b> <b>expenses</b> can be used as an alternative to Accrual Models in explaining the earnings management phenomena around the earnings threshold. In the additional study, we find that factors affected earnings management can 2 ̆ 7 t explain the variation of Deferred <b>Tax</b> <b>Expenses.</b> Meanwhile it can be used to explain the three-accrual models significantly. This finding suggests that the use of deferred <b>tax</b> <b>expenses</b> as a proxy in earnings management is still in doubt...|$|R

40|$|The current {{differences}} in the global economic literature have been taken into consideration and definitions are formulated for tax neutrality as opposed to <b>tax</b> <b>expenses</b> (<b>tax</b> privileges). The issues concerning the borderline between these two principles are outlined, {{as well as the}} opposition between the ideal concepts of the theory and the unavoidable compromises of the practice. The key obvious forms of <b>tax</b> <b>expenses</b> are revealed as deviations from the horizontal tax equity principle. The advantages and the disadvantages of the tax neutrality and the <b>tax</b> <b>expenses</b> are analyzed as contradictory approaches according to the contemporary economic theories. An attempt was made to contribute to the clarification and alignment of the terms of the available theoretical points of view, and to create a “coordinate system” in support of the practical tax policy aiming at a better implementation of the tax equity principle (horizontal and vertical). ...|$|R
50|$|In the United States, the U.K. and elsewhere, {{companies}} {{are permitted to}} report one pre-tax income number (also called income before tax, profit before tax or earnings before income tax) to shareholders, and another, called taxable income, to the tax authorities. Differences between taxable income and the pre-tax income or profit number reported for financial statements are either temporary or permanent in nature. Permanent differences result when deductibility rules differ in perpetuity between accounting and tax law. Temporary differences result when the recognition of deductions for tax and accounting standards differ in their timing. The result is a gap between <b>tax</b> <b>expense</b> computed using income before tax and current tax payable computed using taxable income. This gap is known as deferred tax. If the <b>tax</b> <b>expense</b> exceeds the current tax payable {{then there is a}} deferred tax payable; if the current tax payable exceeds the <b>tax</b> <b>expense</b> then there is a deferred tax receivable.|$|E
