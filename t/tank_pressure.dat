5|$|Upfront, Vettel {{had reduced}} {{the gap between}} himself and Alonso to one second by lap50 as the pair {{continued}} to trade the fastest lap time. Glock started to slow on the circuit {{and drove to the}} pit lane to retire. It was later confirmed that his retirement was the result of an issue with his car's hydraulic system. With the advantage of having newer tyres which gave him more grip, Kubica was able to make short work of Alguersuari, Buemi, his teammate Petrov, Massa, Hülkenberg, and Sutil (who was holding up a queue of five cars) in the space of nine laps. Vettel continued to pressure race-leader Alonso in the closing laps as the pair began to encounter slower cars. Kovalainen and Buemi made contact in the final sector of the lap, with the latter spinning around in front of the Toro Rosso, who was quick to avoid a head-on collision. Kovalainen's car suffered a cracked fuel <b>tank</b> <b>pressure</b> release valve and he limped back to the pit lane, the rear of his Lotus catching fire during the final few turns. Kovalainen aborted the pit entry, but did not make it much further as his car was consumed by the fire. Kovalainen stopped on the main straight and got out of his car to extinguish the fire himself after members of the Williams team handed him a fire extinguisher. As Kovalainen was off the racing line, yellow flags were waved in the final corners instead of a safety car deployment.|$|E

25|$|The {{benefit of}} such a system is that the helium {{delivery}} <b>tank</b> <b>pressure</b> need not {{be as high as}} that used in the partial pressure method of blending and residual gas can be 'topped up' to best mix after the dive. This is important mainly because of the high cost of helium.|$|E
25|$|Kestrel is a LOX/RP-1 {{pressure-fed}} rocket engine, and {{was used}} as the Falcon 1 rocket's second stage main engine. It is built around the same pintle architecture as SpaceX's Merlin engine but does not have a turbo-pump, and is fed only by <b>tank</b> <b>pressure.</b> Its nozzle is ablatively cooled in the chamber and throat, is also radiatively cooled, and is fabricated from a high strength niobium alloy.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{inside the}} first stage can be of the diaphragm type or the piston type. Both types can be balanced or unbalanced. Unbalanced regulators have the cylinder pressure pushing {{the first stage}} upstream valve closed, which is opposed by the intermediate stage pressure and a spring. As cylinder pressure falls the closing force is less, so the regulated pressure increases at lower <b>tank</b> <b>pressure.</b> To keep this pressure rise within acceptable limits the high-pressure orifice size is limited, but this decreases the total flow capacity of the regulator. A balanced regulator keeps about the same ease of breathing at all depths and pressures, by using the cylinder pressure to also indirectly oppose {{the opening of the}} first stage valve.|$|E
50|$|The {{pressure-fed}} {{engine is}} {{a class of}} rocket engine designs. A separate gas supply, usually helium, pressurizes the propellant tanks to force fuel and oxidizer to the combustion chamber. To maintain adequate flow, the <b>tank</b> <b>pressures</b> must exceed the combustion chamber pressure.|$|R
50|$|Maximum {{boil-off}}/minimum oil:- In {{this mode}} the <b>tank</b> <b>pressures</b> are kept low {{and you have}} a greater boil-off but still there is a large amount of fuel oil used. This decreases the amount of LNG delivered but the cargo will be delivered cold which many ports prefer.|$|R

25|$|Most {{cylinder}} valves {{are currently}} of the K-valve type, {{which is a}} simple manually operated screw-down on-off valve. In the mid-1960s, J-valves were widespread. J-valves contain a spring-operated valve that is restricts or shuts off flow when <b>tank</b> <b>pressure</b> falls to 300-500 psi, causing breathing resistance and warning the diver {{that he or she}} is dangerously low on air. The reserve air is released by pulling a reserve lever on the valve. J-valves fell out of favor with the introduction of pressure gauges, which allow divers to keep track of their air underwater, especially as the valve-type is vulnerable to accidental release of reserve air and increases the cost and servicing of the valve. J-valves are occasionally still used when work is done in visibility so poor that the pressure gauge cannot be seen, even with a light.|$|E

50|$|Minimum boil-off/maximum oil:- In {{this mode}} <b>tank</b> <b>pressures</b> are kept high to reduce {{boil off to}} a minimum and the {{majority}} of energy comes from the fuel oil. This maximises the amount of LNG delivered but does allow tank temps to rise due to lack of evaporation. The high cargo temps can cause storage problems and offloading problems.|$|R
2500|$|In the [...] "single-hose" [...] {{two-stage}} design, {{the first}} stage regulator reduces the cylinder pressure of up to about [...] to an intermediate pressure (IP) of about [...] above ambient pressure. [...] The second stage demand valve regulator, supplied by a low-pressure hose from {{the first stage}}, delivers the breathing gas at ambient pressure to the diver's mouth. [...] The exhaled gases are exhausted directly to the environment as waste through a non-return valve on the second stage housing. The first stage typically {{has at least one}} outlet port delivering gas at full <b>tank</b> <b>pressure</b> which is connected to the diver's submersible pressure gauge or dive computer, to show how much breathing gas remains in the cylinder.|$|E
2500|$|According to the operators, the MIC <b>tank</b> <b>pressure</b> gauge {{had been}} {{malfunctioning}} for roughly a week. Other tanks were used, rather than repairing the gauge. The build-up in temperature and pressure {{is believed to}} have affected the magnitude of the gas release. UCC admitted in their own investigation report that most of the safety systems were not functioning on the night of 3 December 1984. The design of the MIC plant, following government guidelines, was [...] "Indianized" [...] by UCIL engineers to maximise the use of indigenous materials and products. Mumbai-based Humphreys and Glasgow Consultants Pvt. Ltd., were the main consultants, Larsen & Toubro fabricated the MIC storage tanks, and Taylor of India Ltd. provided the instrumentation. In 1998, during civil action suits in India, it emerged that the plant was not prepared for problems. No action plans had been established to cope with incidents of this magnitude. This included not informing local authorities of the quantities or dangers of chemicals used and manufactured at Bhopal.|$|E

These values may vary depending on the diver and other circumstances. A diver selecting a pony bottle can do such an analysis for his/her own breathing rates, cylinder pressure to be used, and required ascent profile, or take professional advice on the selection. Since monitoring of remaining air is a key safety issue during a dive, the submersible pressure gauge attached to the pony bottle regulator should be readable {{at any time during the}} dive.|$|E
40|$|A {{procedural}} code (C++) simulation {{was developed}} to investigate potentials for mixture ratio control of pressure-fed spacecraft rocket propulsion systems by measuring propellant flows, tank liquid quantities, or both, and using feedback from these measurements to adjust propellant <b>tank</b> <b>pressures</b> to set the correct operating mixture ratio for minimum propellant residuals. The pressurization system eliminated mechanical regulators {{in favor of a}} computer-controlled, servo- driven throttling valve. We found that a quasi-steady state simulation (pressure and flow transients in the pressurization systems resulting from changes in flow control valve position are ignored) is adequate for this purpose. Monte-Carlo methods are used to obtain simulated statistics on propellant depletion. Mixture ratio control algorithms based on proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller methods were developed. These algorithms actually set target tank pressures; the <b>tank</b> <b>pressures</b> are controlled by another PID controller. Simulation indicates this approach can provide reductions in residual propellants...|$|R

2500|$|Through mid-March 1944, {{only four}} of the 26 {{successful}} Blizna launches had satisfactorily reached the Sarnaki target area due to in-flight breakup (Luftzerleger) on re-entry into the atmosphere. (As mentioned above, one rocket was collected by the Home Army, parts of it transported to London for tests.) [...] Initially, the German developers suspected excessive alcohol <b>tank</b> <b>pressure,</b> but by April 1944 after five months of test firings, the cause was still not determined. Major-General Rossmann, the Army Weapons Office department chief, recommended stationing observers in the target area – c. May/June, Dornberger and von Braun set up a camp at {{the centre of the}} Poland target zone. After moving to the Heidekraut, SS Mortar Battery 500 of the 836th Artillery Battalion (Motorized) was ordered on 30 August to begin test launches of eighty 'sleeved' rockets. Testing confirmed that the so-called 'tin trousers' – a tube designed to strengthen the forward end of the rocket cladding — reduced the likelihood of air bursts.|$|E

The unit consisted of a cylinder of compressed air carried {{on the back of the}} diver, connected to a pressure regulator designed by Le Prieur adjusted manually by the diver, with two gauges, one for <b>tank</b> <b>pressure</b> and one for output (supply) pressure. Air was supplied continually to the mouthpiece and ejected through a short exhaust pipe fitted with a valve as in the Fernez design, however, the lack of a demand regulator and the consequent low endurance of the apparatus limited the practical use of LePrieur's device.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} phase of testing, called Pressure Testing, {{candidates}} who have successfully performed the Valsalva maneuver will be subjected to increased ambient pressure. [...] This test is performed under the supervision of a diving-certified medical doctor. [...] All testees enter a pressure chamber, accompanied by the doctor, and the 'tank' is sealed. [...] Typically, there is in the chamber a somewhat surprising object: an inflated volleyball, water polo ball or similar inflated ball. [...] Upon sealing the <b>tank,</b> <b>pressure</b> is increased, while the testees equalise their eardrum pressure. [...] (if any testee is unable to 'Valsalva', the test stops, and pressure is slowly released.) [...] Pressure builds within the chamber until the chamber is equal to water pressure at [...] "escape depth". [...] At this point, the chamber feels very warm and dry, and the volleyball has become compressed enough that it has become the shape of a bowl, and appears to have been emptied of air, due to the greatly increased air pressure inside of the tank. [...] Sounds inside the tank at pressure sound as if they are [...] "far away".|$|E
