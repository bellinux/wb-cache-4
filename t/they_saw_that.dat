5|$|A video by Ken McCallum, a {{cameraman}} for Channel4 News, was broadcast on 8 April. Shot {{from a different}} angle, the footage shows Harwood draw his arm back to head height before bringing the baton down on Tomlinson's legs. McCallum was filming another incident at the time; the Tomlinson incident was unfolding in the background, unseen by the journalists but recorded by the camera. Half an hour later Alex Thomson, chief correspondent of Channel4 News, was doing a live broadcast when the camera was damaged. It took engineers days to recover the tape, which is when <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Tomlinson's assault was on it.|$|E
5|$|Later in {{the morning}} North Korean barges crossed the Naktong below A Company. The company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the {{southern}} tip of the ridge overlooking Agok to take these troops under fire. When the squad reached the tip of the ridge <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> a North Korean force occupied houses at its base. The company hit these houses with artillery. The North Koreans broke from the houses, running for the river. At this the light machine gun {{at the tip of the}} ridge took them under fire, as did another across the Naktong to the south in the US 25th Infantry Division sector. Proximity fuze artillery fire decimated this group. Combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties on this North Korean force. In the afternoon, US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company; only part of it was recovered. The 1st Battalion ordered A Company to withdraw the company that night.|$|E
5|$|The sudden {{loss of the}} {{flagship}} and the fleet admiral threw the already scattered Swedish line into confusion and sapped morale. Four ships from Creutz's and Uggla's squadrons immediately fled when <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> {{the flagship}} was lost. Claes Uggla was next in command after Creutz and became the acting commander of the Swedish fleet. When the line came about, Uggla and his ship Svärdet came {{on a collision course}} with the still floating wreckage of Kronan, and were forced to jibe (turn the stern into the wind direction) to avoid it. Svärdets second turn was interpreted by many ships as a signal to turn again; others interpreted it as the beginning of a general retreat, leading to major disorder. Uggla reduced speed in an attempt to gather his forces, but instead was separated from his squadron.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the first act, the judge asks the court clerk to call jurors from the audience. Once the jurors are seated, the prosecution argument begins. Flint explains that Andre was not just Faulkner's secretary, but also his lover. He says Faulkner jilted her to marry Nancy Lee Whitfield and fired Andre, motivating Andre to murder him. Flint then calls a series of witnesses, starting with the medical examiner, who testifies that Faulkner's body was so damaged by the fall {{that it was impossible to}} determine whether he was killed by the impact or was already dead. An elderly night watchman and a private investigator describe the events <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> evening. A police inspector testifies to finding a suicide note. Faulkner's very religious housekeeper disapprovingly describes the sexual relationship between Andre and Faulkner, and says she saw Andre with another man after Faulkner's marriage. Nancy Lee testifies about her and Faulkner's courtship and marriage, portraying both as idyllic. The act ends with Andre speaking out of turn to accuse Nancy Lee of lying.|$|E

25|$|Witnesses in Beled Haawo, Garbaharey, Ceelwaaq and Luuq saw Somali troops {{accompanied}} by ASWJ forces leaving {{in the early}} morning and heading to Al-Shabaab strongholds. Later that day Somali forces seized four villages close to Baardheere, Al-Shabaab's biggest and last stronghold in Gedo. Al-Shabaab did not put up a fight and withdrew once <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> they were outnumbered by Somali Armed Forces.|$|E

25|$|The Dutch finally {{surrendered}} {{after having}} lost their captain {{and three other}} men killed, and twelve officers and men wounded. All the British casualties were Scorpions; she had five wounded, including Williams and Lieutenant Buckland Bluett. The British put forty of the Dutch into irons below deck and prepared to capture the other brig. However, a gale came up and at daybreak <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the gale had moved the vessels too far apart.|$|E
25|$|Another vehicle {{then drove}} down the road, {{carrying}} four people. It was not until they were almost adjacent to Bryant that they realised {{he was carrying a}} gun. Bryant shot at the car, smashing the windscreen. Douglas Horner was wounded by pieces of the windscreen. The car proceeded ahead where White and Wanders tried to get in, but Horner did not realise the situation and drove on. When <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> White had been shot, they came back and picked them up. Both parties then continued down to a local establishment called the Fox and Hound, where they called police.|$|E
25|$|A {{new policy}} on debt collection, {{enforced}} in November 1903, {{also played a}} role in the uprising. For many years, the Herero population had fallen in the habit of borrowing money from colonist traders at extreme interest rates. For a long time, much of this debt went uncollected and accumulated, as most Herero had no means to pay. To correct this growing problem, Governor Leutwein decreed with good intentions that all debts not paid within the next year would be voided. In the absence of hard cash, traders often seized cattle, or whatever objects of value they could get their hands on, to recoup their loans as quickly as possible. This fostered a feeling of resentment towards the Germans on the part of the Herero people, which escalated to hopelessness when <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> German officials were sympathetic to the traders who were about to lose what they were owed.|$|E

25|$|Wagner's and Harker's men started {{climbing}} {{soon after}} Wood's brigades. Wagner got halfway up before {{he received an}} order {{that he was to}} stop {{at the base of the}} ridge. He ordered his men to pull back. As they did, they suffered heavy losses from the elated Confederate defenders. Wagner's brigade suffered more casualties, around 22%, than any other brigade in the assault. When Wagner and some of Harker's men returned to the rifle pits <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Wood's division on their left and units of their own division on the right were still moving uphill. Disgusted that a rival division was getting ahead, Wagner sent his second line up the ridge. Sheridan soon ordered Harker back up also. To their right, Francis Sherman's brigade faced an entrenched line about one-half of the way up the ridge and had hard going. On the far right, Johnson's two brigades faced determined resistance at the rifle pits and were slow in starting up the ridge.|$|E
25|$|In February 1990, the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet {{elections}} {{led to the}} Sąjūdis-backed nationalists {{achieving a}} two-thirds majority. On 11 March 1990, the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet declared Lithuania's independence. As a result, the Soviets imposed a blockade on 17 April. Latvia and Estonia, with large Russian minorities, lagged behind. At the same time, the Popular Fronts were in increasing the pressure in Latvia and Estonia, as the citizens committee movement prepared for wholly non-Soviet elections to take place {{at or near the}} time of the Supreme Soviet elections. <b>They</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> independence could never be restored legally by organs of the occupying powers. The pro-independence candidates received overwhelming majorities in the Supreme Soviet elections of March 1990. On 30 March 1990, the Estonian Supreme Soviet declared independence. In particular, it declared the 1940 annexation illegal and began the transition towards an independent Republic of Estonia. On 4 May 1990, the Latvian Supreme Soviet made a similar declaration.|$|E
25|$|On 23 August 1794, , Captain John Borlase Warren, and , Captain Sir Edward Pellew, chased two French corvettes, Alerte and Espion into Audierne Bay. The two corvettes {{anchored}} off the Gamelle Rocks, {{but when}} <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the British intended to capture them, their captains got under weigh and ran their vessels aground below the guns of three shore batteries. The corvettes continued to exchange fire {{with the two}} British frigates until early evening, when the corvettes' masts fell. At that point many of the French crewmen abandoned their vessels and went ashore. Warren sent in the boats from both Flora and Arethusa, all under Pellew's command, with orders to set fire or otherwise destroy the two corvettes. Pellew went in and took possession of both, but determined {{that he could not}} extract the wounded. Pellew therefore left the vessels, which he determined were bilged and scuttled, with rocks having pierced their bottoms, and left with 52 prisoners. Pellew estimated that Alerte had suffered 20 to 30 men killed and wounded, and that Espion had lost more.|$|E

25|$|Everyone {{agreed with}} Su Ze. With support from Zhang Ji, the Inspector of Yong Province, and Zhang Gong (張恭), the Chief Clerk of Dunhuang, Su Ze started {{launching}} military operations {{to suppress the}} rebellions. He first led his troops to Wuwei Commandery to assist Guanqiu Xing in putting down the unrest caused by the local tribes. After pacifying Wuwei Commandery, he joined forces with Guanqiu Xing to attack Zhang Jin in Zhangye Commandery. When Qu Yan heard about it, he led 3,000 men to meet Su Ze and lied {{that he wanted to}} surrender while secretly plotting to incite a mutiny. Su Ze saw through Qu Yan's lies, lured him into a trap and executed him. The rebels fled when <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Qu Yan was dead. Su Ze then gathered his allies, attacked Zhangye Commandery together, and defeated and killed Zhang Jin. The other rebels surrendered. When Huang Hua learnt that Qu Yan and Zhang Jin had been defeated and killed, he became fearful and surrendered to Su Ze. The rebellions thus came to an end. Su Ze returned to Jincheng Commandery in triumph. As a reward for his contributions, Su Ze was elevated from the status of a Secondary Marquis to a Marquis of a Chief Village (都亭侯) and given a marquisate of 300 taxable households.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970–71 season Leeds were runners up in {{the league}} again, in {{controversial}} circumstances. With four games to play, Leeds were two points clear {{at the top of}} the league. Whilst playing West Bromwich Albion, Leeds had a Mick Jones goal dissalowed and later in the game a Leeds pass was intercepted by West Bromwich player Tony Brown. Brown paused, as his teammate Colin Suggett was running back from an offside position – the linesman flagged for offside, and the majority of players stopped when <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the flag was raised. Referee Ray Tinkler overruled the linesman, allowing Brown to play the ball to Jeff Astle, who scored what proved to be the winning goal. Both Revie and the Leeds fans were so enraged at the decision that they invaded the pitch to protest, and consequently the FA banned Leeds from playing their first five home games of the following season at home. Despite winning all their remaining games (including a 1–0 victory over rivals Arsenal) Leeds lost the title to Arsenal by 1 point, in doing so accumulating a record number of points for second place, 12 points ahead of third placed Tottenham. In addition, Leeds went out of the FA C{{up in the}} 5th round in a shock 3–2 defeat by Colchester, who were in the Fourth Division at the time. There was consolation in Europe though; Leeds won the Fairs Cup for a second time, beating Juventus over two legs, with Mick Bates, Paul Madeley and Allan Clarke scoring the crucial goals.|$|E

500|$|It {{took four}} {{attempts}} before Shackleton {{was able to}} return to Elephant Island to rescue the party stranded there. He first left South Georgia a mere three days after he had arrived in Stromness, after securing the use of a large whaler, The Southern Sky, which was laid up in Husvik Harbour. Shackleton assembled a volunteer crew, which had it ready to sail by the morning of 22 May. As the vessel approached Elephant Island <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> an impenetrable barrier of pack ice had formed, some [...] from their destination.

They saw an explicit attack on party government and party deals, using patronage alone to secure support. <b>They</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the loyalty of the ministers was principally toward Paraná, the Emperor, and a non-partisan approach to patronage (which ipso facto, undercut their party and strengthened the cabinet)." [...] Saquaremas found it harder to accept the cabinet's aid being diverted—in an attempt to secure more support for cabinet initiatives—from themselves to Liberal candidates in provincial and general elections.|$|E
