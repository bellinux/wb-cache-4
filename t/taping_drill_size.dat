The ability of using the 3 D image avoids the possible bias of the image cut selection and the tunnel-images mismatch present on 2 D measurements. This method preserves the 2 D CT method ability of evaluating the enlargement in different portions of the tunnel length. The best fit cylinder method presented a good agreement to the <b>drill</b> <b>size</b> (0.745 of ICC), and the closest mean difference to the <b>drill</b> <b>size</b> 0.04  mm. It has the advantage of evaluating the entire tunnel at once and was automated. The wall thickness method presented a poor agreement to the <b>drill</b> <b>size</b> and had a mean difference compared to the <b>drill</b> <b>sizes</b> of 3.38  mm due to variability in orientation of the triangles that composed the 3 D model shape, downsizing the overall measurement.|$|R

30|$|The most {{important}} finding {{of our study}} was that the 3 D best fit transverse section method presented excellent accuracy for measuring tunnel width and excellent intraobserver reliability. Of all the 3 D model methods, the best fit cylinder method was the closest to the mean <b>drill</b> <b>size.</b> However, it had a higher standard deviation and lower accuracy, evaluated by the ICC, compared to the transverse section method.

Mean (±SD) differences between measurement and <b>drill</b> <b>size</b> are reported. Intra- and inter-method agreement were assessed using the two-way random, single measures, absolute agreement form of the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). ICC values were classified as excellent (> 0.75), fair to good (0.40 - 0.75) or poor (< 0.40) [[26]–[28]].

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to study the effect of process parameters on machining process. This procedure {{eliminates the need for}} repeated experiments, time and conserves the material by the conventional procedure. The drilling parameters and specimen parameters evaluated are speed, feed rate, <b>drill</b> <b>size</b> and specimen thickness. A series of experiments are conducted using Radial Drilling Machine to relate the cutting parameters and material parameters on the cutting thrust and torque. The measured results were collected and analyzed {{with the help of the}} commercial software package MINITAB 15. An orthogonal array, signal-to-noise ratio are employed to analyze the influence of these parameters on cutting force and torque during drilling. The method could be useful in predicting thrust and torque parameters as a function of cutting parameters and specimen parameters. The main objective is to find the important factors and combination of factors influence the machining process to achieve low cutting low cutting thrust and torque. From the analysis of the Taguchi method indicates that among the all-significant parameters, speed and <b>drill</b> <b>size</b> are more significant influence on cutting thrust than the specimen thickness and the feed rate. Study of response table indicates that the specimen thickness, and <b>drill</b> <b>size</b> are the significant parameters of torque.

Groups 1, 2, and 3 were restored using a fiber post size that was identical to the <b>drill</b> <b>size</b> (sizes 1, 2, and 3, respectively), and groups 4 and 5 were both prepared with <b>drill</b> <b>size</b> 3, and restored using the size 2 and 1 fiber post, respectively.

40|$|Background Revision {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction requires a precise evaluation of previous tunnel locations and diameters. Enlargement of the tunnels, despite not usually affecting primary reconstruction outcomes, {{plays an important role}} in revision ACL management. Three dimensional (3 D) computed tomography (CT) models are reported to be the most accurate method for identifying the tunnel position and possible conflicts with a revision tunnel placement. However, the ability of 3 D CT to measure the tunnel size is still not proven. The goal of this study was to evaluate the ability of measuring the size of the bone tunnels in ACL reconstructed knees with 3 D CT compared to the traditional two dimensional (2 D) CT method. Methods Twenty-four patients had CT scans performed immediately following ACL reconstruction surgery. Their femoral tunnels size were measured by a standard 2 D CT measurement and then compared with three novel 3 D CT measuring methods: the best transverse section method, the best fit cylinder method and the wall thickness method. The <b>drill</b> <b>size</b> used during surgery was used as a control measure for the tunnel width. Intra-class correlation coefficients were obtained. Results The intra-class correlation coefficient and respective 95 % confidence interval range (ICC [95 %CI]) for the three methods compared with the <b>drill</b> <b>sizes</b> were 0. 899 [0. 811 - 0. 947] for the best transverse section method, 0. 745 [0. 553 - 0. 862] for the best fit cylinder method, − 0. 004 [− 0. 081 to − 0. 12] for the wall thickness method and 0. 922 [0. 713 - 0. 97] for the 2 D CT method.
