500|$|Despite his {{scholarly}} {{achievements and}} the global importance of his work, Achebe never received a Nobel Prize, which some observers viewed as unjust. When Wole Soyinka was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Literature, Achebe joined the rest of Nigeria in celebrating the first African ever to win the prize. He lauded Soyinka's [...] "stupendous display of energy and vitality", {{and said he was}} [...] "most eminently deserving of any prize". In 1988 Achebe was asked by a reporter for Quality Weekly how he felt about never winning a Nobel Prize; he replied: [...] "My position is that the Nobel Prize is important. But it is a European prize. It's not an African prize... Literature is not a heavyweight championship. Nigerians may <b>think,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> this man has been knocked out. It's nothing to do with that." ...|$|E
500|$|Bennion {{praised the}} {{performances}} of Smith and Riley, but said that Smith was [...] "undoubtedly" [...] {{the star of the}} show. Vicki Power, writing for the Daily Telegraph, agreed that Smith was the star, calling her [...] "brilliant", while Patrick Mulkern, writing for Radio Times, said that Smith offered [...] "another multi-faceted, stunning performance as the troubled Christine". Chater said that Smith's role was [...] "superbly performed, as always", and Billen said that Smith offered [...] "tragic depth" [...] to her character. Wilson commended Smith's [...] "arresting performance", saying that [...] "No one does girl-next-door naturalism better â€“ she has the actor's elixir of making you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> her, just by a smile or an inflection." [...] Dessau commended the writers for allowing other actors to play the lead roles, praising {{the performances of}} Ridley and, especially, Smith.|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. {{requested}} {{in press}} releases that critics {{not discuss the}} film's ending. Richard Schickel of Time magazine disregarded the request and revealed Rusty's innocence in his review. He wrote, [...] "Carolyn's murderer has an excellent motive both for killing her... But {{it is hard to}} accept the possibility that the real perpetrator would leave his escape from the trap entirely to chance." [...] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel surmised, [...] "It's not that Warner Bros. is actually concerned that reviewers will tip the solution to the murder mystery. It's that the studio wants to further the impression that the movie is full of surprises." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated, [...] "Even if you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what the solution is, the performances are so clever and the screenplay... is so subtle that it could well turn out that your expectations are wrong." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1989, Lindsay Doran, the new {{president}} of production company Mirage Enterprises, was on a company retreat brainstorming potential film ideas when she suggested the Jane Austen novel Sense and Sensibility to her colleagues. It had been adapted three times, most recently in a 1981 television serial. Doran was a longtime fan of the novel, and had vowed in her youth to adapt it if she ever entered the film industry. She chose to adapt this particular Austen work because there were two female leads. Doran stated that [...] "all of [...] books are funny and emotional, but Sense and Sensibility is the best movie story because it's full of twists and turns. Just when you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what's going on, everything is different. It's got real suspense, but it's not a thriller. Irresistible." [...] She also praised the novel for possessing [...] "wonderful characters... three strong love stories, surprising plot twists, good jokes, relevant themes, and a heart-stopping ending." ...|$|E
500|$|As such, {{executive}} producer and writer Russell T Davies {{had to come}} up with a story that had a good reason to keep the Doctor and Rose out. Davies was inspired by the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode [...] "The Zeppo" [...] and the [...] episode [...] "Lower Decks", both of which focused on atypical characters. Davies described the episode, [...] "It's an experimental script. Not so experimental that people will run away screaming from Saturday-night BBC1, because you can experiment too much. People still want a bit of a monster and a bit of a thrill and a bit of the Doctor, so it still delivers as normal Doctor Who. But just as you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> everything this programme can do, this puts a little bit of spin on it." [...] The episode had the working title of [...] "I Love the Doctor". The acronym [...] "LINDA" [...] was previously used on the British children's television programme Why Don't You?, which featured the [...] "Liverpool Investigation 'N' Detective Agency". Russell T Davies worked on the series for some years.|$|E
500|$|Buffy's dream {{includes}} several references to {{past and future}} episodes. In a dream sequence in the season three finale, Faith says [...] "Little Miss Muffet counting down from 7-3-0"; foreshadowing Dawn's arrival two years later in season five. This number appears (as 7:30) on a clock in Buffy's dream in [...] "Restless". Buffy says, [...] "It's so late." [...] Tara replies, [...] "Oh... that clock's completely wrong." [...] A year has now passed, making the previous number of days to her arrival incorrect. When Buffy leaves the room, Tara tells her, [...] "Be back before Dawn." [...] The character Dawn appears in the next episode. Tara's words to Buffy, [...] "You <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what's to come, what you are. You haven't even begun." [...] are repeated by Dracula to Buffy in the following episode ("Buffy vs. Dracula"). In Xander's dream, Giles and Spike swing together on a swing set, with Spike wearing a tweed jacket. Giles comments, [...] "Spike's like a son to me." [...] In [...] "Tabula Rasa" [...] (season six), when the characters lose their memories, Spike wears the same tweed jacket and believes Giles is his father.|$|E

500|$|Swift {{began writing}} [...] "Fifteen" [...] with the lyric [...] "And Abigail gave {{everything}} she had to a boy/ Who changed his mind/ We both cried", which eventually became the song's bridge, and continued writing everything else in a backwards manner. The song was written about Swift's freshman {{year of high school}} at Hendersonville High School, where she met her best friend Abigail Anderson. [...] "I just decided I really wanted to tell that story about our first year of high school because I felt in my freshman year, I grew up more than any year in my life so far", Swift stated. The events it focused on were how both Swift and Anderson fell in love for the first time, but both suffered of heartbreaks. Aside from reminiscing on the events she and Anderson experienced, Swift wrote cautionary lyrics, intended to target teenage girls entering or already in their freshman year of high school. She described it as incorporating things she wished someone would have told her in a song when she was younger. [...] "The thing about high school, you don't know anything. You don't know anything, but you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> everything", Swift said.|$|E
500|$|... "The Duel" [...] {{was written}} by Jennifer Celotta, a {{producer}} and show runner with The Office. The episode featured {{the conclusion of the}} love triangle between Dwight, Andy and Angela, a subplot that had been going on since the fourth season finale, [...] "Goodbye, Toby". The cast and writing staff saw [...] "The Duel" [...] as a defining episode for Andy Bernard because it demonstrated a softer, more emotional side of the character. Dean Holland, who directed the episode, said this was particularly effective because in past episodes, he displayed such rage problems that he had to attend anger management courses, but in [...] "The Duel" [...] he responded to horrible news in a heartrending way. Rainn Wilson particularly praised Ed Helms' performance, saying, [...] "He gives a lot of heart and soul, and Andy is such a doofus and a douche, and now you really get to see his heart break. There's some reality there. That's the great thing this show gives us, just when you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> the characters and they're two-dimensional and they're goofy and crazy, in their own way, you get real human redemption." ...|$|E
500|$|Two critics from Pitchfork Media {{reviewed}} [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] {{separately from}} Night Time, My Time. Jenn Pelly ranked the track as the twelfth-best song released in 2013. She spoke favorably of its lyrical content, commending the chorus lyrics [...] "How could {{you know what}} it feels like to fight the hounds of hell?" [...] and [...] "You <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> me so well" [...] for painting Ferreira as an exemplar for [...] "bullied high school weirdos", and appreciating that the lines [...] "I know it's not your fault / That you don't understand / I blame myself" [...] for acknowledging her own wrongdoings with the intention of starting anew. Jillian Mapes complimented the [...] "bluntness" [...] that was delivered throughout the song, and suggested that the track had [...] "anthem potential". She praised the verses for verbalizing self-confidence issues that are often associated with young women, with particular acclaim being placed on the lines [...] "Iâ€™m just a face without a choice / Trust youâ€™d never like to guess what I think above the shoulders." [...] She concluded her review by noting that the song should be recognized as a [...] "declaration of force [...] a song about the power of vulnerability" [...] rather than confusing it for an [...] "admission of weakness".|$|E

500|$|... "Love a Woman" [...] is a down-tempo soulful R ballad with {{a female}} {{empowerment}} theme and live-sounding instruments. The soothing track starts off with Blige singing with a dark voice, [...] "So you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> how to love a woman/ But I think it's still some {{things you need to}} know." [...] As the flowery instrumental builds with a serene piano melody and accentuating horns, Blige goes on to warn that a woman needs more than material things. A writer of Billboard magazine further noted that the song was schooling men on just how good to love a woman. During her lines, BeyoncÃ© sings with a vibrato voice, [...] "A woman / Needs you to make love to her / She needs more than sex / Oh, a real woman needs a real man / They donâ€™t talk about it, be about it / Put that work in, still shows his woman real romance". According to Rob Markman of MTV News, [...] "From there, the song plays as a lyrical how-to. Communication is a must, as is respect, but coming home late and being a one-minute man is a no-no." [...] Writers further noted that the duet was inspired by the music from the 1990s including a new jack swing-era R production. BeyoncÃ© and Blige further sing the lines [...] "She doesnâ€™t want makeup sex, she wants your respect." [...] The song also has an extended bridge section during the 2:30 mark where Blige sings the lines [...] "Pick up your phoneâ€¦just to say you're still in love from time to timeâ€¦" [...] with a vocal styling which was compared to Michael Jackson's [...] "Off the Wall" [...] era. It ends with the sound of sparkler synths.Jada Gomez-Lacayo of HipHopDx compared the song with Aaron Hall's material. Ayanna Guyhto of Yahoo! Music compared the first minute of the song with Busta Rhymes' songs due to the speedy wordplay. She further noted that it was similar to the songs by Keith Sweat from the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|... "Breakaway" [...] {{has also}} been covered by contestants from reality {{television}} singing competitions. Katie Stevens covered the song on the ninth season of American Idol. Despite listening to the judges' comments to sing a contemporary song, her rendition was criticized from the judges; Randy Jackson thought the note was too big for Stevens while Ellen DeGeneres felt Stevens did not sell the lyrics. Kara DioGuardi said, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> who you are yet as an artist", an opinion agreed by Simon Cowell. Jim Cantiello of MTV noted that Stevens' performance of the song was her weakest performance in the show, stating [...] "Unfortunately, her uneven vocals on 'Breakaway' exposed her youthful inexperience." [...] The same opinion was echoed by Eric Ditzian of MTV who opined that Stevens failed to resonate her youthful energy favouring the song choice. [...] "Breakaway" [...] was performed by Julie Zorrilla in the semi-finals of American Idol season 10. Samantha Stephens of The Republican felt Zorrilla's performance was mediocre. Gil Kaufman of MTV remarked that Zorrilla's voice was shaky and it lacked personality. After landing in the bottom two, Belle Amie, an English pop quartet contestant on the seventh season of The X Factor, decided to perform [...] "Breakaway" [...] as their survival song. Nevertheless, they were eliminated in the episode. Swedish Idol contestant, Alice Hagenbrant covered the song which appeared in Det bÃ¤sta frÃ¥n Idol, an album released from the musical competition. The song was also performed by Megan Hilty on the episode titled [...] "Understudy" [...] of the American television series Smash, which aired on April 7, 2012. Matt Tucker of KSiteTV.com thought the performance was [...] "lovely", describing {{it as one of}} the things that stood out in the episode. The song was covered by Jenna Ushkowitz, Kevin McHale and Darren Criss, on the 97th episode, [...] "Frenemies", of the musical series Glee, which aired on February 25, 2014. For the thirteenth season of American Idol, the song is used as the send off song when a contestant is voted off. The contestant who is voted off, their cover of the song is played during the goodbye montage video package. It was also used in thirtieth season of Brazilian soap opera MalhaÃ§Ã£o.|$|E
