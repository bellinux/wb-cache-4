40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} extent to which <b>target</b> <b>forcing</b> {{functions}} consisting of multiple ramplike or steplike changes in target attitude can be used for identification of multimodal pilot models. The main question addressed is whether such signals provide enough excitation of the pilot–vehicle system to allow for reliable estimation of pilot model parameters from measured pilot control data. The compensatory control task from a previous human-in-theloop experiment performed in a moving base flight simulator is used to define a typical multimodal pilot model identification problem. Using simulations of this control task, where different multisine and ramp <b>target</b> <b>forcing</b> function signals are used to excite the pilot–vehicle system (in addition to a multisine disturbance signal), the accuracy and consistency of pilot model estimation results are evaluated. It is found that both the bias and variance of the pilot model parameter estimates decrease with increasing ramp signal steepness. If the steepnesses of the ramps in the target signals are higher than 3 deg =s, estimation results are found to be more accurate than those obtained using a quasi-random <b>target</b> <b>forcing</b> function. This indicates that reliable pilot model identification results can be obtained using such ramp <b>target</b> <b>forcing</b> function signals...|$|R

50|$|Three {{imaginary}} {{countries were}} involved. The central power Whiteland found itself suddenly confronted simultaneously by Greenland to its north with whom {{it had been}} in dispute for some time and Brownland to its south with whom it had previously enjoyed a friendly relationship. The manoeuvres involved the conflict between Brownland which crossed Whiteland's southern border with two armies and the less substantial White forces, centred on Daventry, which were to oppose them.The Manoeuvres excited much attention, both locally and nationally. King George V and Queen Mary were present along with Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, and Baden-Powell. There were military observers from most of the major European Powers along with representatives from the Colonies.The Times described these Exercises as essentially a practice of command function in an expeditionary force of four infantry and one cavalry divisions.50,000 men and 25,000 horses had been brought into north Buckinghamshire and south Northamptonshire where they were dispersed for three weeks of training before being assembled to form the two forces which engaged each other over five days from 22 September. The smaller White Army formed a <b>target</b> <b>force</b> to enable the Brown Army to engage it and pursue it in its retreat. Brown's 1st Army, under Lt.-Gen Sir Douglas Haig, advanced through central Buckinghamshire to engage White forces by crossing the River Ouse to take Buckingham and Silverstone, and then sweep north to the White entrenchment which had been prepared south of Daventry. There they joined up with the left flank of the Brown 2nd Army. This army under command of Gen. Sir A.H. Paget had de-trained at Wolverton before advancing up the Watling Street through Towcester and then moving north-west to attack the White Army's prepared position south of Daventry which was where it was to make its stand. Allenby's Cavalry had been detailed to protect the Brown Force's left flank, advancing through Brackley towards the west of Daventry, where they could engage possible White reinforcements dispatched from Redditch and Leamington Spa.|$|E

Subjects pressed against a simulated spring with the index finger until they reached a <b>target</b> <b>force,</b> which they held for a designated time duration. Visual feedback of the <b>target</b> <b>force</b> level and the designated time duration was provided.

Our regression analyses showed that rated effort was strongly predicted by the visual feedback of force regardless of the actual force produced.

40|$|The response-related medial-frontal {{activity}} (MFN) {{is often}} supposed to reflect action-monitoring and error-processing activity. The present force-production task {{was designed to}} investigate the effects of two response parameters (i. e., peak response force and time-to-peak, TTP) on the MFN separately. In a 2 × 2 design (high vs. low <b>target</b> <b>force</b> and short vs. long TTP), 22 participants had to produce isometric force pulses to match one of four conditions (e. g., a high <b>target</b> <b>force</b> with a long TTP). Significant main effects of both <b>target</b> <b>force</b> and target TTP were revealed. As previously shown, the MFN amplitude was higher in the high target-force condition than in the low target-force condition. Contrary to the initial expectations, a long TTP {{had the effect of}} reducing the MFN amplitude. There was no error-specific effect on the MFN. The force-unit monitoring model (FUMM) is suggested to account for the force- and TTP- specific variations of MFN amplitude, latency and slope...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies on}} {{learning}} force patterns (fine motor skills) {{have focused on}} providing “punctual information”, which means users only receive information about their performance at the current time step. This work proposes a new approach based on “contextual information”, in which users receive information {{not only about the}} current time step, but also about the past (how the <b>target</b> <b>force</b> has changed over time) and the future (how the <b>target</b> <b>force</b> will change). A test was run to compare the performance of the contextual approach in relation to the punctual information, in which each participant had to memorize and then reproduce a pattern of force after training with a multimodal system. The findings suggest that the contextual approach is a useful strategy for force pattern learning. The advantage of the contextual information approach over the punctual information approach is that users receive information about the evolution of their performance (helping to correct the errors), and they also receive information about the next forces to be exerted (providing them with {{a better understanding of the}} <b>target</b> <b>force</b> profile). Finally, the contextual approach could be implemented in medical training platforms or surgical robots to extend the capabilities of these systems...|$|E

Overflow relative to the <b>target</b> <b>force</b> was greater in children compared to adults, and at the lower <b>target</b> <b>force</b> for both groups, but was not influenced by attentional stimulation.

Twenty-one participants used force input to set 10 different target levels representing consecutive force ranges (0 to 4 N) with visual feedback (digits or bar graphs) or no feedback.

Statistical comparisons of adjacent targets/digits indicated that subjects differentiated roughly seven input levels within {{the set of}} ten force ranges actually used. Time taken to input the <b>target</b> <b>force</b> increased significantly {{with the size of}} the <b>target</b> <b>force,</b> suggesting that smaller force ranges should be considered in future implementations of force input.

They are the need for better integration of the model and processes within the manpower system, development of concrete measures of effectiveness, improved documentation, and an effective education program. The study suggests that while the results of the TFPM are satisfactory for the users, organizational refinements could possibly increase its effectiveness. U. S. Marine Corps (U. S. M.

ParticipantsEleven physiotherapy educators (academic and clinical) and 25 physiotherapy students (4 th year). Outcome measuresThe clinically-representative maximum force was determined by physiotherapy educators performing posteroanterior mobilisations on a simulated neck for a hypothetical patient. The force used by the educators became the <b>target</b> <b>force.</b> Videos of physiotherapy students performing posteroanterior mobilisations to this force were analysed for (i) the ability to maintain the recommended thumb position while attempting to reach the force, and (ii) the ability to maintain the position during 30 oscillations around the force.
