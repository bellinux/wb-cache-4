25|$|In the following, we have {{to remind}} {{ourselves}} {{that every one of}} Turing’s “computing machines” is a binary-number generator/creator that begins work on “blank tape”. Properly constructed, it always cranks away ad infinitum, but its instructions are always finite. In Turing’s proofs, Turing’s tape had a “left end” but extended right ad infinitum. For sake of example below we will assume that the “machine” is not a Universal machine, but rather the simpler “dedicated machine” with <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> <b>in</b> the Table.|$|E

The daily Panividai starts {{very early in the}} morning. Everyday, around 3:00 A.M the Payyans and the people staying at the temple go to Muthirikkinaru and take a holy bath. Then, they return to the Pathi and start the panividai. The Payyan chant Ukappatippu, and the devotees repeat it. Then, they open the door of sanctum sanctorum. It is considered sanctifying to witness this scene with the sounding of a dozen temple bells and conch. Then, there is the Vahana pavani.|$|E

The maze ends up being so complicated that it can even be difficult {{to work out the}} next move, let alone the end. In this maze, you have to use two hands, each starting at a different place. <b>The</b> <b>instructions</b> <b>in</b> one box might {{have to do with the}} box that the other hand is in, boxes you have already left, or complex combinations of the two.|$|E

30|$|MicroBlaze also {{supports}} reset, interrupt, user exception, break and hardware exceptions. For interrupts, MicroBlaze supports only one external interrupt source (connecting to the interrupt input port). If multiple interrupts are needed, an interrupt controller {{must be used}} to handle multiple interrupt requests to MicroBlaze. An interrupt controller is available for use with the Xilinx EDK software tools. The processor will only react to interrupts if the interrupt enable (IE) bit in the MSR is set to 1. On an interrupt <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> execution stage will complete, while <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decode stage {{is replaced by a}} branch to the interrupt vector (address 0  ×  10). The interrupt return address (the PC associated with <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decode stage {{at the time of the}} interrupt) is automatically loaded into general-purpose register R 14. In addition, the processor also disables future interrupts by clearing the IE bit in the MSR. The IE bit is automatically set again when executing <b>the</b> RTID <b>instruction.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In 1980, Searle {{presented}} the [...] "Chinese room" [...] argument, which purports {{to prove the}} falsity of strong AI. Assume you do not speak Chinese and imagine yourself {{in a room with}} two slits, a book, and some scratch paper. Someone slides you some Chinese characters through the first slit, you follow <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> <b>in</b> the book, transcribing characters as instructed onto the scratch paper, and slide the resulting sheet out the second slit. To people on the outside world, it appears the room speaks Chinese—they slide Chinese statements in one slit and get valid responses in return—yet you do not understand a word of Chinese. This suggests, according to Searle, that no computer can ever understand Chinese or English, because, as the thought experiment suggests, being able to 'translate' Chinese into English does not entail 'understanding' either Chinese or English: all which the person in the thought experiment, and hence a computer, is able to do is to execute certain syntactic manipulations.|$|E

2500|$|While {{waiting to}} repair the airplane, the Signal Corps decided to seek a more {{favorable}} climate location for flying during the winter. Foulois was directed to report to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas where he was directed by CSO Allen to [...] "teach yourself to fly." [...] He did so, and at 9:30 a.m. on March 2, 1910, on the Arthur MacArthur parade field made four flights on S.C. No. 1, which included his first solo takeoff, first solo landing, and first crash. Over the next fifteen months, Foulois modified S.C. No. 1's elevators at <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> <b>in</b> correspondence from Orville Wright, and demonstrated {{the use of the}} Wright B aircraft for aerial mapping, photography, reconnaissance {{and the use of the}} radio while airborne. To end the requirement of using a 60-foot launch rail to take off, he drew up plans for and installed wheels in place of skids, and equipped the S.C. No. 1 with the first seat belt, using a four-foot leather cinch obtained from the cavalry saddlery. As the result of repeated crashes and repairs, many caused by Foulois being [...] "ground shy" [...] (the result of his having no formal training in landing an airplane), S.C. No. 1 became unflyable, and in February 1911 the Army leased a Wright Model B from Robert Collier. Because Foulois was unfamiliar with the type, the Wright Company sent Philip O. Parmalee to instruct.|$|E
