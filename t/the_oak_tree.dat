5|$|Royal Oak {{was laid}} down at Devonport Royal Dockyard on 15 January 1914. She was {{launched}} on 17 November, and after fitting-out, was commissioned on 1 May 1916 at a final cost of £2,468,269. Named after <b>the</b> <b>oak</b> <b>tree</b> in which CharlesII hid following his defeat at the 1651 Battle of Worcester, {{she was the}} eighth vessel to bear the name Royal Oak, replacing a pre-dreadnought scrapped in 1914.

It was split by lightning on July 29, 2011; officials were unsure if the tree would survive. However, after urging by a group raising money to protect the tree, government arborists inspected the tree which was found to be alive and well. The tree was completely felled by strong winds on or around July 22, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Many other annual events {{take place}} in the Bay Area as well. The Strawberry Festival in Pasadena celebrates the role the iconic fruit played in rescuing the town's economy {{following}} the 1900 Hurricane. The Blessing of the Fleet boat parade in Kemah is an annual event that celebrates Kemah's history as a shrimp fishing town. The Gulf Coast Film Festival annually showcases independent films from local, regional and international artists in various categories ranging from short films to documentaries. Other annual events include the Wings over Houston Air Fest (Ellington Field), the Music Fest by the Bay (Texas City), the Ballunar Festival, <b>the</b> <b>Oak</b> <b>Tree</b> Festival (League City), and the South Shore Dockside Food & Wine Festival (League City).Barrington (2008), p. 271. In Anahuac the annual Gatorfest celebrates the semi-rural culture of Chambers County. And, of course, {{in the spirit of the}} state to which the area belongs, the annual Pasadena Livestock Show and Rodeo features traditional rodeo events for area spectators.|$|E

5|$|There are {{numerous}} other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the Tudor rose, the nation's floral emblem, and the Three Lions {{featured on the}} Royal Arms of England. The Tudor rose was adopted as a national emblem of England {{around the time of}} the Wars of the Roses as a symbol of peace. It is a syncretic symbol in that it merged the white rose of the Yorkists and the red rose of the Lancastrians—cadet branches of the Plantagenets who went to war over control of the nation. It is also known as the Rose of England. <b>The</b> <b>oak</b> <b>tree</b> is a symbol of England, representing strength and endurance. The Royal Oak symbol and Oak Apple Day commemorate the escape of King Charles II from the grasp of the parliamentarians after his father's execution: he hid in an oak tree to avoid detection before safely reaching exile.|$|E

25|$|Likewise, it is {{also said}} that the Cruz de la Victoria was at first carved in an oak's log by a {{lightning}} strike. The core of this story contains two elements of major importance in the Asturian folklore: On one hand, lightning was the ancient symbol of the Astur god Taranis, and in Asturian mythology was thought to be forged by the Nuberu, lord of clouds, rain and wind. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>oak</b> <b>tree</b> is the symbol of the Asturian royalty and in reliefs of the Abamia Church (where Pelayo was buried) leaves of that tree are shown.|$|E
25|$|Each hole {{has its own}} name, {{and some}} holes are named after famous courses or golf holes. The {{signature}} hole is the fifth hole (named Oak Tree), a 592-yard par five where players must avoid <b>the</b> <b>oak</b> <b>tree</b> that {{is used in the}} club's logo. Other notable holes include the eighth hole (named Harbor Town after Dye's Harbour Town Golf Links), par three with water down the entire left side. The tenth hole (named after the Prairie Dunes Country Club) is a long, tight par four. The 13th hole is named due to its size, after a postage stamp. Golfers liken landing a ball on the green to landing a ball on a space the size of a postage stamp.|$|E

500|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson {{says that}} the notion of an eagle atop a tree and the World Serpent coiled around the roots of the tree has {{parallels}} in other cosmologies from Asia, and that Norse cosmology may have been influenced by these Asiatic cosmologies from a northern route.

500|$|It {{was next}} {{recorded}} by the antiquarian Josiah Colebrooke in a short article that he wrote for Archaeologia, {{the journal of the}} Society of Antiquaries of London, in 1773. Aided by the minister of the parish, the Reverend Buttonshaw, Colebooke enquired among elderly locals as to whether they had heard of <b>the</b> <b>oak</b> <b>tree</b> mentioned by Harris, but none had. Colebrooke asserted that it was to the Addington area that the Britons retreated after their defeat at the Battle of Aylesford, and that it was here that they buried their military leader, Categern. However, the later archaeologist John H. Evans has claimed that Colebrooke's descriptions and drawings are [...] "almost completely worthless" [...] because the antiquarian incorrectly thought the monument to be a stone circle rather than a rectangular chambered tomb. Colebrook's analysis was echoed in the 18th-century writings of Samuel Pegge, Edward Hasted, and John Thorpe.|$|E
500|$|The prison site {{became a}} tourist attraction, {{with many of}} the rooms and props {{remaining}} including the false pipe through which Andy escapes, and a portion of <b>the</b> <b>oak</b> <b>tree</b> from the finale, after it was damaged in 2011.

The prison itself was to be torn down completely following filming, but was eventually sold to enthusiasts for $1. According to the Mansfield/Richland County Convention and Visitors Bureau (later renamed Destination Mansfield), tourism in the area had increased every year since The Shawshank Redemption premiered, and in 2013 drew in 18,000 visitors and over $3 million to the local economy. As of 2017, Destination Mansfield operates the Shawshank Trail, a series of 15 marked stops around locations related to the film across Mansfield, Ashland, Upper Sandusky, and St. Croix.|$|E

500|$|The 15-acre reformatory, housing its {{own power}} plant and farm, was {{partially}} torn down shortly after filming was completed, leaving the main administration building and two cell blocks. Several of the interior shots of the specialized prison facilities, such as the admittance rooms and the warden's office, were shot in the reformatory. The interior of the boarding room used by Brooks and Red was in the administration building; exterior shots of the boarding house were taken elsewhere. Internal scenes in the prison cellblocks were filmed on a soundstage built inside a nearby shuttered Westinghouse Electric factory. Since Darabont wanted the inmates' cells to face each other, almost all the cellblock scenes were shot on a purpose-built set housed in the Westinghouse factory [...] except for the scene featuring Elmo Blatch's admission of guilt for the crimes for which Andy was convicted.

Following {{a survey by the}} National Weather Service, the tornado was estimated to have been about [...] wide and was rated as an EF2. Most of the downtown residences were left without power after the tornado struck the area around 2:59pm CST (20:59UTC). Ten minutes earlier, tornado sirens were sounded as a tornado warning was issued for the area. Students who were being taken home by bus at the time were immediately taken to the nearest school for shelter. The schools were placed in lockdown for about two hours following the tornado sirens. In Edmond, six homes were destroyed, eight structures received major damage, 51received minor damage and another 166structures were affected. Some of the homes damaged by the tornado were estimated to be worth over $1million. <b>The</b> <b>Oak</b> <b>Tree</b> Golf Club sustained severe damage, with numerous trees being uprooted.

Nannetta, as the Fairy Queen, instructs her helpers ("Sul fil d'un soffio etesio" [...] / [...] "On the breath of a fragrant breeze, fly, nimble spirits") before all the characters arrive on the scene. Falstaff's attempted love scene with Alice is interrupted by the announcement that witches are approaching, and the men, disguised as elves and fairies, soundly thrash Falstaff. At length he recognises Bardolfo in disguise. The joke is over, and Falstaff acknowledges that he has received his due. Ford announces that a wedding shall ensue. Caius and the Queen of the Fairies enter. A second couple, also in masquerade, ask Ford to deliver the same blessing for them as well. Ford conducts the double ceremony. Caius finds that instead of Nannetta, his bride is the disguised Bardolfo, and Ford has unwittingly blessed the marriage of Fenton and Nannetta. Ford accepts the fait accompli with good grace. Falstaff, pleased to find himself not the only dupe, proclaims in a fugue, which the entire company sings, that all the world is folly, and all are figures of fun (Tutto nel mondo è burla...
