5|$|The Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike uses <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> system {{method of}} tolling between the Mid-County and Wyoming Valley toll plazas {{along with the}} {{mainline}} Pennsylvania Turnpike. With <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> system, a motorist receives a ticket upon entering the turnpike at an interchange and pays the fare and surrenders <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> upon exiting. If a motorist loses <b>the</b> <b>ticket,</b> the turnpike charges the highest fare to the exit where the motorist leaves. Mainline toll plazas are also located at Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit, charging a flat rate. There are no tolls on exit ramps between Wyoming Valley and Clarks Summit. E-ZPass is accepted at all toll plazas. As of 2017, it costs a passenger vehicle $12.10 to travel {{the length of the}} Northeast Extension between Mid-County and Wyoming Valley using cash and $8.54 using E-ZPass. The Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas cost $1.45 using cash and $0.81 using E-ZPass for passenger vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Tickets for the 2009 final {{were similar}} to ATM cards, with an {{integrated}} chip storing <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> holder's personal information {{in order to ensure}} that <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> is being presented by its legitimate owner. As further security, tickets also had to be presented with an adequate form of photographic identification. However, despite these security measures, counterfeit tickets were still produced, forcing UEFA to issue a statement warning people against buying tickets from touts.|$|E
5|$|A Standard Ticket {{contactless}} {{smart card}} for single or return journeys {{may also be purchased}} at the GTM for the payment of MRT and/or LRT fares. A S$0.10 deposit will be levied on top of the fare to be paid. The deposit will be automatically refunded through an offset of the fare to be paid for the third journey on the same ticket while an additional discount of S$0.10 will be given for the sixth journey on the same ticket. No refund of the deposit is provided if the card is used for fewer than 3 journeys. <b>The</b> <b>ticket</b> can be used for the purchase of single or return journeys to and from pre-selected stations up to a maximum of six journeys over 30 days. Fares for the Standard Ticket are always higher than those charged for the stored-valued CEPAS (EZ-Link and NETS FlashPay) cards for the same distance traveled. <b>The</b> <b>ticket</b> is retained by the user after each journey and {{does not need to be}} returned to any GTM or Passenger Service Centre. Identical to the usage of CEPAS cards, <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> is tapped onto the faregate reader upon entry and exit.|$|E

A part of the narrow bays is infilled by kiosks, integral poster boards, roundel signs and fixed seating. The platforms are linked by a secondary bridge at the southern end. Reinforced concrete platform canopies replaced the original timber canopies. Since 17 May 1994, the station has been a Grade II Listed building.|$|E
5|$|Built with a {{range of}} shops to both sides, the modernist design of the {{entrance}} vestibule {{takes the form of a}} double-height box clad in white Portland stone with a three-part glazed screen on the front façade divided by columns of which the capitals are three-dimensional versions of the Underground roundel. The central panel of the screen contains a large version of the roundel. <b>The</b> <b>ticket</b> hall beyond is octagonal with a central roof light of the same shape. <b>The</b> <b>ticket</b> hall originally had a pair of wooden ticket booths (passimeters) from which tickets were issued and collected, but these were removed when modern ticketing systems made them redundant.|$|E

5|$|Demand {{for tickets}} by Alabama fans {{was so great}} that the Alabama ticket office accidentally {{oversold}} its allotment of tickets. The office neglected to limit purchases on the forms sent to season-ticket holders, and the office received more than 25,000 orders for its 12,500-ticket allotment. An additional 2,000 tickets were given to Alabama, but the school still had to send out more than 10,000 refunds. Alabama's athletics director was heavily criticized for overselling <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> allotment and for limiting ticket distribution to fans who had contributed large amounts of money to the athletics department. A group of fans disgruntled at <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> distribution process eventually levied a class-action lawsuit against the athletic director, claiming contract violations.|$|E
5|$|During World War II {{the station}} was bombed, {{which led to the}} {{destruction}} of the wooden spire of the clock tower above <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> office on 3 January 1941. Gas lighting was replaced by fluorescent electric lights in 1960.|$|E

5000|$|Through the [...] "Childhood" [...] menu, Next sold tickets {{through their}} website in batches. Several tables would be opened up, and {{announcements}} {{were made on}} their Facebook and Twitter pages when <b>tickets</b> were available. <b>The</b> <b>tickets</b> sold rapidly.

This has sparked {{the creation of a}} secondary market for <b>the</b> <b>tickets,</b> which has resulted in reports of people scalping <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> for several times their face value.|$|R
5000|$|Although neither network {{guaranteed}} <b>the</b> {{accuracy of}} <b>ticket</b> listings or <b>the</b> availability of <b>tickets,</b> TicketNetwork's [...] "Broker Guidebook" [...] required sellers to accurately list the seat location printed on <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> for sale, and prohibited <b>the</b> sale of <b>tickets</b> <b>the</b> seller did not own {{at the time}} of listing.

5|$|Palmer and Buckner {{both had}} {{developed}} reputations as independent executives {{while serving as}} governors of their respective states. Because they had served on opposite sides during the Civil War, their presence on the same ticket emphasized national unity. <b>The</b> <b>ticket</b> was endorsed by several major newspapers including the Chicago Chronicle, Louisville Courier-Journal, Detroit Free Press, Richmond Times, and New Orleans Picayune. Despite these advantages, <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> was hurt by the candidates' ages, Palmer being 79and Buckner 73. Further, some supporters feared that voting for the National Democrat ticket would be a wasted vote and might even throw the election to Bryan. Ultimately, Palmer and Buckner received just over {{one percent of the}} vote in the election.|$|E

5|$|The Pennsylvania Turnpike uses <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> {{system of}} tolling between the Warrendale and Neshaminy Falls toll plazas, {{as well as}} on the Northeast Extension to Wyoming Valley. When {{entering}} the turnpike, motorists receive a ticket listing the toll for each exit; <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> is surrendered when exiting, and the applicable toll is paid. If <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> is lost, motorists are charged the maximum toll for that exit. Cash, credit cards, and E-ZPass are accepted at traditional toll plazas. An eastbound mainline toll plaza is located at Gateway near the Ohio border, charging a flat toll using cash or E-ZPass, and an all-electronic westbound mainline toll gantry is located at the Delaware River Bridge near the New Jersey border, charging a flat toll using TOLL BY PLATE (which uses automatic license plate recognition to take a photo of the vehicle's license plate and mail a bill to the vehicle owner) or E-ZPass at highway speeds. There is no toll between Gateway and Warrendale and between Neshaminy Falls and the Delaware River Bridge. The PA29 interchange and the westbound Virginia Drive and eastbound Street Road interchanges only accept E-ZPass.|$|E
50|$|On 25 June 2013, Kelantan fans turned unruly {{after the}} 2013 Piala FA final tickets were {{sold out in}} 10 minutes after counter opened.

This caused the agitated fans {{to break down the}} stadium gate before forcing the seller to hand over the bag containing <b>the</b> <b>tickets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Only {{one person}} can use a ticket. If {{multiple}} people are traveling together, <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> are linked together by the same record locator or reservation number, which are assigned, if <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> were purchased at the same time. If not, most airlines can cross-reference <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> together in their reservation systems. This allows all members in a party to be processed in a group, allowing seat assignments to be together (if {{available at the time}} of the assignment) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the game is to place the numbers inside the {{triangle}} in <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> that have matching numbers, to fill out <b>the</b> <b>tickets.</b> All tickets that get filled help the player obtain points, but some tickets are better than others.

There may be {{individuals}} {{who wish to}} attend a popular event (and decide to sell their tickets later) and those that buy tickets in large quantities in order to resell their tickets for a profit. Some countries have restricted the unauthorized resale of tickets.|$|R
