5|$|The Devils {{assembled}} {{a core of}} players that included John MacLean, Bruce Driver, Ken Daneyko, Kirk Muller and Pat Verbeek, with Resch as their goaltender. Their record improved each season between 1983–84 and 1986–87. However, {{they were unable to}} reach the playoffs. Despite their improvement, the Devils remained last in the Patrick Division in 1985–86 and 1986–87.

5|$|Despite {{wanting to}} contact {{his parents in}} the United States, Owumi {{was not able to}} access the Internet or use his phone for {{international}} calls. He was also without electricity and had little food or water. Al-Nasr <b>team</b> <b>president</b> Ahmed Elturki also told Owumi that the airport in Libya had been burned down by protesters and advised him to remain in his apartment. Trapped in Mutassim's apartment during conflict, Owumi was eventually forced to drink toilet water with tea bags, urinate in the bathtub, and defecate into plastic bags. He also ate cockroaches and worms he found in the flower pots. His poor living conditions caused his teeth to rot and his skin to discolor.|$|E
5|$|During the 2015 offseason, Ray Shero {{was named}} the Devils' new general manager, and John Hynes was named as the new head coach. Lou Lamoriello {{resigned}} as <b>team</b> <b>president</b> and became {{the general manager of}} the Toronto Maple Leafs, replacing Dave Nonis, who was fired {{at the end of the}} season. In the 2015–16 season, the Devils finished seventh in the Metropolitan Division with 84 points, missing the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season. The team finished in last place in the Eastern Conference the following season with 70 points; this was the first time that they finished last in the conference since the 1985–86 season. However, they won the ensuing draft lottery to secure the first overall selection in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft, which they used to select Halifax Mooseheads center Nico Hischier.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Ross {{had signed}} Georges Boucher as coach, but Boucher {{did not work}} well with Ross and <b>team</b> <b>president</b> Weston Adams. Looking to hire a new coach {{in the summer of}} 1950, Ross phoned Lynn Patrick, the son of Lester, who had just {{resigned}} from the New York Rangers after coaching the team to the Stanley Cup Final. Lynn had moved his family back to Victoria, British Columbia, where he grew up as a child, with the intention of coaching the Victoria Cougars, a team in the minor professional Pacific Coast Hockey League. Though reluctant to move back to the eastern United States, Lynn was hired by Ross after he was offered a salary of $12,000. He would coach the team for the next four seasons and become the second general manager of the Bruins when Ross retired at the end of October 1954.|$|E
50|$|He {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of BC Kyiv. Volkov, who already retired from playing in 1995, {{returned}} for several appearances to help the newly found team in 2000. He has also served as the <b>team's</b> <b>president.</b>|$|R
50|$|Patterson {{joined the}} Portland Trail Blazers as <b>team's</b> <b>president</b> in June 2003. He became {{the general manager}} after John Nash's {{contract}} was not renewed in May 2006, and served in both roles until resigning on March 1, 2007.|$|R
50|$|In May 2016, the Milwaukee Bucks NBA {{team was}} the victim of this type of cyber scam with a {{perpetrator}} impersonating the <b>team's</b> <b>president</b> Peter Feigin, resulting in the handover of all the team's employees' 2015 W-2 tax forms.|$|R
5|$|Mike McCormack, a Hall of Fame lineman for the Cleveland Browns {{and former}} coach and {{executive}} for the Seattle Seahawks, was the Panthers' first <b>team</b> <b>president,</b> presiding {{in that role}} from 1994 {{until his retirement in}} 1997; McCormack was inducted as the first person in the Carolina Panthers Hall of Honor later that year. Jerry Richardson's son, Mark, was appointed as the team's second president in 1997 and served in that role until he stepped down in 2009. His brother Jon, who had been president of Bank of America Stadium, stepped down at the same time. The resignations of Mark and Jon Richardson were unexpected, as it was thought that the two would eventually take over the team from their father. Mark Richardson was replaced by Danny Morrison, who had previously served as the athletic director of both Texas Christian University and Wofford College, Richardson's alma mater.|$|E
5|$|Then-Bruins {{head coach}} Don Cherry {{suggested}} that the reason Orr never re-signed with the Bruins was Orr's complete trust in Eagleson at the time (Orr said that he described Eagleson as a brother). Cherry recalled Orr had refused {{to speak with the}} Bruins <b>team</b> <b>president</b> directly, allowing Eagleson to mislead or withhold enough details from Boston's offer. Orr's departure from the Bruins was acrimonious and he has not held an official role with the Bruins since. Years later, it emerged that Eagleson had very good relations with Black Hawks owner Bill Wirtz and NHL president John Ziegler that colluded to hold back salaries of certain players. Orr disassociated himself from Eagleson in 1980.|$|E
5|$|After the 2004–05 NHL lockout and the {{implementation}} of a salary cap, the Avalanche were forced to release some of their top players. Peter Forsberg and Adam Foote were lost to free agency to save room in the cap for Joe Sakic and Rob Blake. Although the salary cap was a blow to one of the highest spenders of the league, the Colorado Avalanche finished the 2005–06 regular season with a 43–30–9 record for 95 points, good enough to finish second in the Northwest Division, seven behind the Calgary Flames and tied with the Edmonton Oilers. The season paused in February for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. The Avalanche sent an NHL leading 11 players from eight countries. Finnish Antti Laaksonen earned the silver medal, while Ossi Vaananen ended up not playing because of an injury; Czech Milan Hejduk won a bronze medal. In the Western Conference Quarter-finals, Colorado beat the team with the second-best record in the Western Conference, the Dallas Stars, in five games. In the Conference Semi-finals, the Avalanche were swept for the first time ever, coming {{at the hands of the}} Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The day after the loss, Pierre Lacroix, who had been the general manager of the franchise since 1994 when they were in Quebec, resigned, where Francois Giguere was then hired as his replacement. Lacroix remained president of the franchise until Spring of 2013, when the team owner's son, Josh Kroenke, took over as <b>team</b> <b>president</b> and governor. Pierre Lacroix remains an advisor to the team.|$|E
