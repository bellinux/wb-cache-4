25|$|Noise is {{unwanted}} {{changes to}} the MR signal from elements not {{of interest to the}} study. The five main sources of noise in fMRI are thermal noise, system noise, physiological noise, random neural activity and differences in both mental strategies and behavior across people and across tasks within a person. Thermal noise multiplies in line with the static field strength, but physiological noise multiplies as the square of the field strength. Since the signal also multiplies as the square of the field strength, and since physiological noise is a large proportion of <b>total</b> <b>noise,</b> higher field strengths above 3nbsp&T do not always produce proportionately better images.|$|E
25|$|Physiological {{noise is}} from head and brain {{movement}} in the scanner from breathing, heart beats, or the subject fidgeting, tensing, or making physical responses such as button presses. Head movements cause the voxel-to-neurons mapping to change while scanning is in progress. Since fMRI is acquired in slices, after movement, a voxel continues {{to refer to the}} same absolute location in space while the neurons underneath it would have changed. Another source of physiological noise is the change in the rate of blood flow, blood volume, and use of oxygen over time. This last component contributes to two-thirds of physiological noise, which, in turn, is the main contributor to <b>total</b> <b>noise.</b>|$|E
25|$|Smoothing, or spatial filtering, is {{the idea}} of {{averaging}} the intensities of nearby voxels to produce a smooth spatial map of intensity change across the brain or region of interest. The averaging is often done by convolution with a Gaussian filter, which, at every spatial point, weights neighboring voxels by their distance, with the weights falling exponentially following the bell curve. If the true spatial extent of activation, that is the spread of the cluster of voxels simultaneously active, matches the width of the filter used, this process improves the signal-to-noise ratio. It also makes the <b>total</b> <b>noise</b> for each voxel follow a bell-curve distribution, since adding together a large number of independent, identical distributions of any kind produces the bell curve as the limit case. But if the presumed spatial extent of activation does not match the filter, signal is reduced.|$|E
3000|$|As {{a special}} case of the {{proposed}} waveform, filtering-based waveforms apply rectangular windowing. The resulting <b>total</b> output <b>noise</b> power is N_F = ∑ _i= 1 ^Pσ _z_i^ 2, which is obtained by substituting wm= 1,∀m∈ 0,⋯,M− 1 into (14). By letting F (e^j 2 π/M(i+K- 1)) = 1, ∀ i ∈{ 1, [...]..., P } and adopting rectangular windowing, the <b>total</b> output <b>noise</b> of the conventional OFDM system is obtained as N_C = ∑ _i= 1 ^Pσ _i^ 2.|$|R

50|$|If several {{devices are}} cascaded, the <b>total</b> <b>noise</b> factor {{can be found}} with Friis' Formula:where Fn is the noise factor for the n-th device, and Gn is the power gain (linear, not in dB) of the n-th device. The first {{amplifier}} in a chain usually has the most {{significant effect on the}} <b>total</b> <b>noise</b> figure because the noise figures of the following stages are reduced by stage gains. Consequently, the first amplifier usually has a low noise figure, and the noise figure requirements of subsequent stages is usually more relaxed.|$|E
30|$|From these results, it is {{convenient}} that the <b>total</b> output <b>noise</b> of the implemented amplifying and filtering chain is mostly {{defined by the}} induction coil thermal noise and less by the preamplifier noise. In particular, experimental measurements on several outdoor environments indicate that voltage gain amplifier stage should have a passband gain of 4 for better performance on Schumann measuring and recording resonances. In that case, the equivalent rms input noise of the last amplifying and filtering chain stage approximates to 5135.3  nV. Besides, each system stage has its own impact on the <b>total</b> output <b>noise.</b> That impact is determined by each stage noise value and its sequential arrangement at our amplifying and filtering chain system. The last consideration {{is based on the}} fact that the stage voltage noise experiences lower gain and thus exhibits less effect on the <b>total</b> system <b>noise</b> as it arranges closer to the output of our chain.|$|R

50|$|If {{the noise}} is one-sided white noise, i.e., {{constant}} with frequency, then the <b>total</b> <b>noise</b> power N integrated over a bandwidth B is N = BN0 (for double-sided white noise, the bandwidth is doubled, so N is BN0/2). This is utilized in signal-to-noise ratio calculations.|$|E
50|$|Since each {{data symbol}} {{occupies}} {{a much wider}} bandwidth (in hertz) than the data rate (in bit/s), a ratio of signal to noise-plus-interference (if defined as signal power divided by <b>total</b> <b>noise</b> plus interference power in the entire transmission band) of less than 0 dB is feasible.|$|E

40|$|Background: Studies {{investigating}} leisure {{noise effect}} on extended high frequency hearing are insufficient {{and they have}} inconsistent results. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate if extended high-frequency hearing threshold shift is related to audiometric notch, and if <b>total</b> leisure <b>noise</b> exposure is associated with extended high-frequency hearing threshold shift. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire of the Ohrkan cohort study was used to collect information on demographics and leisure time activities. Conventional and extended high-frequency audiometry was performed. We did logistic regression between extended high-frequency hearing threshold shift and audiometric notch as well as between <b>total</b> leisure <b>noise</b> exposure and extended high-frequency hearing threshold shift. Potential confounders (sex, school type, and firecrackers) were included. Results: Data from 278 participants (aged 18 – 23 years, 53. 2 % female) were analyzed. Associations between hearing threshold shift at 10, 11. 2, 12. 5, and 14 [*]kHz with audiometric notch were observed with a higher prevalence of threshold shift at the four frequencies, compared to the notch. However, we found no associations between <b>total</b> leisure <b>noise</b> exposure and hearing threshold shift at any extended high frequency. Conclusion: This exploratory analysis suggests that while extended high-frequency hearing threshold shifts are not related to <b>total</b> leisure <b>noise</b> exposure, they are strongly associated with audiometric notch. This leads us to further explore the hypothesis that extended high-frequency threshold shift might be indicative of the appearance of audiometric notch at a later time point, which can be investigated in the future follow-ups of the Ohrkan cohort...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{optical fiber}} {{transmission}} systems using inline am-plifiers, {{the interaction of}} a signal and an amplifier noise through the Kerr effect leads to a nonlinear phase noise that can impair detection of phase-modulated signals. The authors show how to minimize the variance of the <b>total</b> phase <b>noise</b> (linear plus nonlin-ear) by a choice {{of the number of}} inline amplifiers N and their spacings and gains, assuming a fixed total system length L and an overall compensation of the fiber loss. In the case of a uniform amplifier spacing and a per-span loss compensation, there exists a finite N that minimizes the <b>total</b> phase <b>noise.</b> This contrasts with the well-known observation that a linear phase noise alone is minimized by a choice of an infinite N. Relaxing the constraints of the uniform spacing and/or the per-span loss compensation leads to further reduction of the <b>total</b> phase <b>noise.</b> The optimization of the spacings and the gains can be approximately formulated as a convex problem. In typical terrestrial and transoceanic systems, the total-phase-noise variance can be reduced by up to 45 % and 83 %.

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} non-separable 2 D quadruple lifting {{structure}} for 4 D {{input signals to}} deal with the problem of degradation in image quality due to integer implementation. It has the advantage that its output signals, apart from rounding noise, are identical to those of a conventional transform the transfer function of which is a product of 16 1 D transfer functions. Unlike the prevalent 3 D quadruple lifting structure, the order of lifting steps in the original separable 4 D transform is preserved. Thus, the <b>total</b> rounding <b>noise</b> is reduced even though the total number of rounding operators remains the same as in prevalent methods. Experiments confirmed that the <b>total</b> rounding <b>noise</b> observed in each frequency band of the decoded images was significantly smaller.
