The Crown was undergoing financial difficulties, and the wealth of the church, in contrast to its political weakness, made appropriation of church property both tempting and feasible.

5|$|Jaguar, Léopard and Panthère were {{assigned}} to the Northern Command (Forces maritimes du Nord) on 7 September in anticipation of a German invasion of Belgium. They proved, however, to be too large and unmaneuverable for operations in the shallow waters of the English Channel and North Sea; Panthère ran aground on 10 September in poor visibility, but suffered only minor damage, and Jaguar did the same <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> night of 28/29 October. The contre-torpilleurs were relieved by smaller torpilleurs d'escadre beginning in mid-October. The other ships {{were assigned}} to the Western Command (Forces maritimes de l'Ouest) for convoy escort duties from October 1939 to May 1940 where they guarded convoys traveling between Gibraltar and Brest as well as Casablanca, French Morocco, and Le Verdon-sur-Mer. They were joined by the first three ships as they were replaced in the Northern Command. Jaguar was badly damaged during a collision with a British destroyer in January 1940 and her repairs were not completed until early May.|$|E

25|$|Pacino went to {{producer}} Martin Bregman {{with the}} intention of getting a Carlito film made. First <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> list was to get a script written that would portray Carlito Brigante's world and provide a suitable showcase for Pacino's talents. David Koepp had just finished writing the script for Bregman's forthcoming The Shadow when producer Michael S. Bregman suggested him to write the script for Carlito's Way. The decision came that the screenplay would be based on the second novel After Hours. Carlito at this stage would match closer with Pacino's age. Although based primarily on the second novel, the title Carlito's Way remained, mainly because of the existence of Martin Scorsese's movie After Hours. Bregman would work closely with Koepp for two years to develop the shooting script for Carlito's Way.|$|E

500|$|The Cubs hired Leo Durocher {{as manager}} in 1966, hoping he could inspire renewed {{interest}} in the team's fan base. Banks hit only 15 home runs; Cubs finished the 1966 season in last place with a 59–103 win-loss record, the worst season of Durocher's career. From the time Durocher arrived in Chicago, he was frustrated at his inability to trade or bench the aging Banks. In Durocher's autobiography, he says:... was a great player in his time. Unfortunately, his time wasn't my time. Even more unfortunately, {{there was not a}} thing I could do about it. He couldn't run, he couldn't field; toward the end, he couldn't even hit. There are some players who instinctively do the right <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> base paths. Ernie had an unfailing instinct for doing the wrong thing. But I had to play him.

500|$|He made a full {{recovery}} from his injuries in time for Born in the U.S.A. (1984), which featured an aerobics-timed beat on some tracks that also owed something to the popular Phil Collins drum sound. [...] Weinberg's own experimentation since the Darkness days had also led to a more reverberant sound. Overall, Weinberg's more fluid drumming combined with Roy Bittan's use of synthesizers and better overall production to give Springsteen a more modern sound, resulting in the album becoming Springsteen's best-selling one ever and spawning a record-tying seven Top 10 hit singles. Springsteen later said of the album, [...] "Max was the best <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> record." [...] Weinberg's most well-known drum part came on [...] "Born in the U.S.A.", where his snare drum paired against Bittan's signature synthesizer riff on the opening and throughout {{the main part of}} the song. The recording then descends into improvised chaos; Springsteen had told Weinberg, [...] "When I stop, keep the drums going." [...] Upon the restart, intentional drum breakdowns matched bass swoops and guitar feedback; Springsteen subsequently said of the performance overall, [...] "You can hear Max – to me, he was right up there with the best of them on that song." [...] Weinberg said it was one of his most intense musical experiences.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic praised the song {{as one of}} the best tracks of the album, calling it [...] "infectious". Sean O'Brien from The People praised [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] as [...] "the best song of the album" [...] and her [...] "one of her best ever". He also said that the song is one of the reasons why Madonna is queen of pop. Jon Pareles from The New York Times considered it as the album's most danceable song. Lucy O'Brien in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, called the song [...] "dazed-sounding". Metro Times described Ahmadzai's programming as [...] "by far the best <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album". James Hannaham from Spin compared [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] to Donna Summer's [...] "I Feel Love", and deemed it as a highlight from the album. Alan Braidwood from BBC Music felt that the song was [...] "insane" [...] with its electronic, chaotic, fast and manic pounding synths. [...] "There is so much going on here several it'll take several plays to really get it, but it's ace." [...] Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly described [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] as the [...] "downright thrilling" [...] and [...] "deploys a shrewd little form-versus-content paradox".|$|E

500|$|To put {{it another}} way, a thing or person is often seen as having a [...] "defining essence" [...] or a [...] "core identity" [...] that is unchanging, and {{describes}} what the thing or person really is. In this way of thinking, things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time, with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity (e.g. [...] "Mark's hair has turned gray as he has gotten older, {{but he is still}} the same person"). But in Whitehead's cosmology, the only fundamentally existent things are discrete [...] "occasions of experience" [...] that overlap one another in time and space, and jointly make up the enduring person or <b>thing.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, what ordinary thinking often regards as [...] "the essence of a thing" [...] or [...] "the identity/core of a person" [...] is an abstract generalization of what is regarded as that person or thing's most important or salient features across time. [...] Identities do not define people, people define identities. [...] Everything changes from moment to moment, and to think of anything as having an [...] "enduring essence" [...] misses the fact that [...] "all things flow", though it is often a useful way of speaking.|$|E
500|$|Modern reviews are {{generally}} positive. AllMusic's Bruce Eder calls the album [...] "one {{of the most}} bracing progressive rock albums ever, and a successful vision of a musical path that the group might have taken but didn't", remarking how Deep Purple succeeded in combining [...] "heavy metal's early, raw excitement, intensity, and boldness with progressive rock's complexity and intellectual scope." [...] Jedd Beaudoin of PopMatters appreciates in his review the heavier sound of the songs and notices how [...] "Evans sounds more and more {{out of place in}} a band that was increasingly more comfortable with stretching itself beyond the confines of pure pop pieces", like in the track [...] "April", which he considers not only [...] "the most ambitious <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> entire record, but also arguably the best." [...] David Bowling, in his Blogcritics column, reviews the album as [...] "the least satisfying of their three early career releases, although it can also be considered their most adventurous" [...] for its [...] "meandering through a number of different styles and sounds." [...] However, considering the growth shown by Blackmore and Lord as performers in this release, he concludes that it is [...] "a fitting conclusion to the band's formative years." ...|$|E
500|$|A few songs feature lyrical collaborations between Vedder {{and other}} members of the group, {{including}} one with Ament ("Ghost"), one with Cameron ("You Are"), and two with Gossard ("Bu$hleaguer" [...] and [...] "All or None"). Sole lyrical contributions from band members other than Vedder include Cameron with [...] "Get Right" [...] and Ament with [...] "Help Help". The album's lyrics tackle existential matters ("Love Boat Captain", [...] "Cropduster", and [...] "I Am Mine"), as well as social and political concerns ("Green Disease", [...] "Bu$hleaguer", and [...] "1/2 Full"). The lyrics of [...] "Save You" [...] represent the anger felt by anyone who watches a close friend waste away his or her life. Regarding [...] "Love Boat Captain", Vedder said, [...] "Love is one resource that the corporations aren't going to be able to monopolize." [...] Vedder said that [...] "Cropduster" [...] is [...] "about man's giant ego, that he's the most important <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> planet." [...] Regarding [...] "Green Disease", Vedder stated he was [...] "mystified" [...] at CEO and corporate-management salaries and [...] "how someone can justify taking that much at the cost of other people's livelihoods." [...] "Bu$hleaguer" [...] is a satirical commentary on President George W. Bush.|$|E

500|$|Erotica {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it [...] "ambitious" [...] {{and noted that}} Erotica contains some of Madonna's best and most accomplished music. Paul Verna from Billboard considered it her most varied and creatively challenging collection to date. Arion Berger of Rolling Stone praised the album's [...] "cold, remote sound", and wrote that [...] "Erotica is everything Madonna has been denounced for being— meticulous, calculated, domineering and artificial. It accepts those charges and answers with a brilliant record to prove them". NME said: [...] "When Erotica the album is good– i.e. when it's funny, original, lively and, yes, sexy– it's {{about as good as}} the modern media event gets." [...] J. D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun stated that the most surprising <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> songs is that they find Madonna singing about love, not about sex. Phil Sutcliffe gave three stars in a review for Q, writing: [...] "The biggest surprise is 'Deeper and Deeper', which could be mistaken for a bopalong tribute to Kylie. However, the substance of Erotica resides in a range of straight-talking, almost intimate songs based, not on an idea about sex, but on experience of relationships." [...] In a retrospective review in Blender, Tony Power concluded: [...] "That female artists (except Millie Jackson) never come on this strongly makes Erotica shocking and, well, arousing." ...|$|E
500|$|For the film's look, the Coens {{wanted to}} avoid the usual retro 1960s clichés like lava lamps, Day-Glo posters, and Grateful Dead music and {{for it to be}} [...] "consistent with the whole bowling thing, we wanted to keep the movie pretty bright and poppy", Joel said in an interview. For example, the star motif {{featured}} predominantly throughout the film, started with the film's production designer Richard Heinrichs' design for the bowling alley. According to Joel, he [...] "came {{up with the idea of}} just laying free-form neon stars on top of it and doing a similar free-form star <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> interior". This carried over to the film's dream sequences. [...] "Both dream sequences involve star patterns and are about lines radiating to a point. In the first dream sequence, the Dude gets knocked out and you see stars and they all coalesce into the overhead nightscape of L.A. The second dream sequence is an astral environment with a backdrop of stars", remembers Heinrichs. For Jackie Treehorn's Malibu beach house, he was inspired by late 1950s and early 1960s bachelor pad furniture. The Coen brothers told Heinrichs that they wanted Treehorn's beach party to be Inca-themed, with a [...] "very Hollywood-looking party in which young, oiled-down, fairly aggressive men walk around with appetizers and drinks. So there's a very sacrificial quality to it." ...|$|E
500|$|The track {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Mike Wass from Idolator {{called it an}} [...] "obtuse synth track" [...] believing the composition to be [...] "ingenious" [...] or [...] "pretentious", and felt that Gaga's endeavors kept the pop music scene interesting. Evan Sawdey from PopMatters believed that the vibe of the previous track on the album, [...] "Do What U Want", carried off to [...] "Artpop" [...] which he described as [...] "strange" [...] and [...] "hypnotic" [...] and the best <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> parent album. Harley listed [...] "Artpop" [...] {{as one of the}} more aurally pleasurable tracks from the album. Calling it a [...] "standout" [...] track, Andrew Barker from Variety compared Gaga's vocals to those of Debbie Harry, with their cold disposition. Emily McKey from NME called the song [...] "slow and purringly sexy", believing that the line [...] "My artpop could mean anything" [...] referred to the trivial concept of the album itself. Critic Greg Kot from Chicago Tribune believed that [...] "Artpop" [...] was the only song on the album, where there was a hint of what the actual composition of the over all record should have been. Justin Miller from Harper's Bazaar called the song more intimate that the previous tracks in the album, but felt it was a techno-ballad and the most diffused composition for Gaga.|$|E
