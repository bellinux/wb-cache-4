40|$|The {{investigation}} of numerical methods for modelling the mechanism properties of involute spur gears in mesh, over the mesh cycle, forms the {{major part of}} this thesis. Gearing is {{perhaps one of the}} most critical components in power transmission systems and the transmission error of gears in mesh is considered to be one of the main causes of gear noise and vibration. Numerous papers have been published on gear transmission error measurement and many investigations have been devoted to gear vibration analysis. There still, however, remains to be developed a general Finite Element Model capable of predicting the effect of variations in rigid body gear tooth position, in which the critical stage is the prediction of gear behaviour with profile modifications (including tip-relief). In this thesis, FEA results have been obtained by using various techniques including: (a) adaptive re-mesh with contacts using quad (2 D) and brick (3 D) elements and (b) the element birth and death option. Tooth profile modifications can affect the behaviour of the gear meshing including the <b>T.</b> <b>E.,</b> <b>ratio</b> of local deformation and load-sharing ratio results, etc, providing an alternative method for gear design. In the high order end, the elastic strains of the gear-shaft system have also been investigated. The results in this thesis have shown the potential for using strain-vibration relationships to monitor or control the transmission system. The investigations have also included some analysis with non-metallic gears, an application area that is rapidly growing. The results achieved here are at a fundamental stage, and further research would necessitate applying a coupled field analysis (structural and thermal) ...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. The central {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to systematically examine the internal structure of multihospital systems, determining the management principles used and the performance levels achieved in medical care and administrative areas. ^ The Universe. The study universe consisted of short-term general American hospitals owned and operated by multihospital corporations. Corporations compared were the investor-owned (for-profit) and the voluntary multihospital systems. The individual hospital was the unit of analysis for the study. ^ Theoretical Considerations. The contingency theory, using selected aspects of the classical and human relations schools of thought, seemed well suited to describe multihospital organization and was used in this research. ^ The Study Hypotheses. The main null hypotheses generated were that there are no significant differences between the voluntary and the investor-owned multihospital sectors in their (1) hospital structures and (2) patient care and administrative performance levels. ^ The Sample. A stratified random sample of 212 hospitals owned by multihospital systems was selected to equally represent the two study sectors. Of the sampled hospitals approached, 90. 1 % responded. ^ The Analysis. Sixteen scales were constructed in conjunction with 16 structural variables developed from the major questions and sub-items of the questionnaire. This was followed by analysis of an additional 7 structural and 24 effectiveness (performance) measures, using frequency distributions. Finally, summary statistics and statistical testing for each variable and sub-items were completed and recorded in 38 tables. ^ Study Findings. While it has been argued that there are great differences between the two sectors, this study found that with a few exceptions the null hypotheses of no difference in organizational and operational characteristics of non-profit and for-profit hospitals was accepted. However, there were several significant differences found in the structural variables: functional specialization, and autonomy were significantly higher in the voluntary sector. Only centralization was significantly different in the investor owned. Among the effectiveness measures, occupancy rate, cost of data processing, total manhours worked, F. <b>T.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>ratios,</b> and personnel per occupied bed were significantly higher in the voluntary sector. The findings indicated that both voluntary and for-profit systems were converging toward a common hierarchical corporate management approach. Factors of size and management style may be better descriptors to characterize a specific multihospital group than its profit or nonprofit status.

It was found that below {{a certain amount of}} sand the natural frequency corresponding to a particular mode shape increases as the mass of sand is increased but as the mass of sand is increased further from that amount the natural frequency would increase. <b>T</b> h <b>e</b> damping <b>ratio</b> corresponds to a mode shape always increases with the mass of sand. The mode shapes themselves may be wiped out due to increased damping ratio, they may emerge from existing modes as the result of heavy coupling due to high damping ratio or they may be entirely new modes due to the contribution of the varying body of mass of sand. These effects of mass of sand on the {{dynamic characteristics}} of the thin wall structure shoud be taken into account in evaluating dynamic response of the structure.

40|$|Green plastida {{prepared}} from seedlings of Pinus silotstris harvested {{after three}} weeks {{of growth in the}} dark, without exposure to light, catalyzed photoreductions of methyl viologen and nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate, and cyclic photophosphory-lation with AT-methylphenazonium methosulfate, but could not catalyze the photoreduc-tion of 2, 4 -dichlorophenol indophenol in the absence and presence of diphenylcarbazide. In dark-grown seedlings of Pinus silvestris, functional photosystem I developed with no exposure to light, but no photosystem II activity was observed. Dark-grown seedlings of angiosperms lack chlorophyll, while dark-grown coniferous seedlings contain chlorophyll (7). This {{is due to the fact}} that the transformation of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide in the biosynthetdc process of chlorophyll proceeds as a photo-reaction in the former seedlings and as a dark-reaction in the latter. Therefore, in dark-grown seedlings of angiosperms, photo-synthetic activities can not be developed without illumination. Exposing etiolated leaves of dark-grown seedlings to light is the essential factor for the formation of chlorophyll and the functional differentiation of photosystems I and II (2 - 5). Recendy, we confirmed quantitatively that dark-grown seedlings of Pinus (P. taeda, P. tkunbergii, P. densithunbergii, P. densiflora and P. silvestris), Cryptomcria japonica, Picea excelsa and Chamaecyparis obtusa contain chlorophylls a and b. <b>T</b> h <b>e</b> <b>ratio</b> of chlorophyll a to b in these seedlings was from 2. 2 to 4. 0 (unpublished data). These ratios are near the values for mature leaves. This suggests the possibility that photosynthetic activities develop in plastids of dark-grown coniferous seedlings, without exposure to light. We succeeded in isolating photoactive chloroplasts from mature leaves of Pinus tkunbergii two years ago (6, 7). This prompted us to investigate the functional development of plastids in dark-grown pine seedlings. The present paper deals with photoreactions associated with photosystem...|$|R

40|$|Multiscale {{interaction}} between the magnetic island and turbulence has been demonstrated through simultaneous two-dimensional measurements of turbulence and temperature and flow profiles. The magnetic island and turbulence can mutually interact via coupling between the electron temperature (<b>T</b> <b>e)</b> gradient, the <b>T</b> <b>e</b> turbulence, and the poloidal flow. The <b>T</b> <b>e</b> gradient altered by the magnetic island steepens outside and flattens inside the island.

40|$|A {{variety of}} methods exist to {{estimate}} the elastic thickness (<b>T</b> <b>e)</b> of the lithosphere. In this contribution, we attempt to provide {{an indication of how}} well the fan wavelet coherence method recovers <b>T</b> <b>e,</b> through synthetic modeling. The procedure involves simulating initial topographic and subsurface loads and emplacing them on a thin elastic plate of known <b>T</b> <b>e,</b> generating the postloading topography and gravity. We then attempt to recover that <b>T</b> <b>e</b> distribution from the gravity and topography through the wavelet method, hence discovering where its strengths and weaknesses lie. The <b>T</b> <b>e</b> distributions we use here have elliptical and fractal geometries, while the initial loads are fractal. Importantly, we have found that this widely used synthetic loading calibration method will tend to result in underestimates of <b>T</b> <b>e</b> no matter which recovery method is used. This is due to random correlations between the initial loads which, on average, serve to increase their coherence at all wavelengths and spatial locations. For the fan wavelet method, the degree of underestimation from this “background” source is approximately 10 % of the true <b>T</b> <b>e.</b> In addition, the fan wavelet coherence method will provide underestimates of (1) the true <b>T</b> <b>e</b> when the study area size is of the order of the highest flexural wavelength or less, (2) relative <b>T</b> <b>e</b> differences when the <b>T</b> <b>e</b> anomaly is narrow compared to its flexural wavelength, and (3) steep <b>T</b> <b>e</b> gradients. Significantly, we find that the recovery is not greatly affected by the assumption of uniform <b>T</b> <b>e</b> in the inversion of the coherence. We also find that <b>T</b> <b>e</b> recovery from the coherence is only weakly dependent upon the initial subsurface-to-surface loading ratio (f). In contrast to the coherence, <b>T</b> <b>e</b> recovery from the admittance is highly “noisy,” with discontinuities and overestimates of <b>T</b> <b>e</b> frequently arising. This is most likely due to the high sensitivity of the admittance to f and is likely to apply to real data as well...|$|R

40|$|There is {{considerable}} controversy regarding the long-term strength of continents (<b>T</b> <b>e).</b> While some authors obtain both {{low and high}} <b>T</b> <b>e</b> estimates from the Bouguer coherence and suggest that both crust and mantle contribute to lithospheric strength, others obtain estimates of only < 25 km using the free-air admittance and suggest that the mantle is weak. At the root of this controversy is how accurately <b>T</b> <b>e</b> can be recovered from coherence and admittance. We investigate this question by using synthetic topography and gravity anomaly data for which <b>T</b> <b>e</b> is known. We show that the discrepancies stem from comparison of theoretical curves to multitaper power spectral estimates of free-air admittance. We reformulate the admittance method and show that it can recover synthetic <b>T</b> <b>e</b> estimates similar to those recovered using coherence. In light of these results, we estimate <b>T</b> <b>e</b> in Fennoscandia and obtain similar results using both techniques. <b>T</b> <b>e</b> is 20 - 40 km in the Caledonides, 40 - 60 km in the Swedish Svecofennides, 40 - 60 km in the Kola peninsula, and 70 - 100 km in southern Karelia and Svecofennian central Finland. Independent rheological modeling, using a xenolith-controlled geotherm, predicts similar high <b>T</b> <b>e</b> in central Finland. Because <b>T</b> <b>e</b> exceeds crustal thickness in this area, the mantle must contribute significantly to the total strength. <b>T</b> <b>e</b> in Fennoscandia increases with tectonic age, seismic lithosphere thickness, and decreasing heat flow, and low <b>T</b> <b>e</b> correlates with frequent seismicity.

As a <b>T</b> <b>E</b> X macro package, it is unique in its concept of logical commands, {{at the same time}} retaining enough flexibility with visually oriented commands to allow the user a relatively easy correction of an automatically chosen layout.

40|$|A {{classical}} way {{of using}} <b>T</b> <b>E</b> X in printed typesetting was enhanced {{for use of}} the same <b>T</b> <b>E</b> X source to publish electronically. A handbook of algebra and a 4 -year journal archive (280 articles) were electronically published using the same <b>T</b> <b>E</b> X source files to produce both the PDF in a form for reading on-screen and a version for printing a hard copy. A package written in plain <b>T</b> <b>E</b> X provided for the mark-up of the logical structure, cross-references, bibliographical references, author names, keywords and symbols. The hypertext contents, index pages and a complete navigation system are also made in PDF and were pre-programmed at the <b>T</b> <b>E</b> X level. Being completely a PDF product the same publications are thus usable on any computer system for which a PDF viewer exists. 1. Introduction "The entry of <b>T</b> <b>E</b> X into the world of hypertext" (as described by Y. Haralambous and S.

But at the same time, he made it clear, {{that he will not}} get involved in any further enhancements that would change The <b>T</b> <b>E</b> Xbook. <b>T</b> <b>E</b> X started out originally as a system designed to typeset its author's own publications. In the meantime it serves hundreds of thousands of users. Now it is time, after ten years' experience, to step back and consider whether or not <b>T</b> <b>E</b> X 3. 0 is an adequate answer to the typesetting requirements of the nineties. Output produced by T EX has higher standards than output generated automatically by most other typesetting systems. Therefore, in this paper we will focus on the quality standards set by typographers for hand-typeset documents and ask to what extent they are achieved by <b>T</b> <b>E</b> X. Limitations of <b>T</b> <b>E</b> X's algorithms are analyzed; and missing features as well as new concepts are outlined. 1 Introduction La [...] ...|$|R
