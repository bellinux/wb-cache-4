5|$|Gyromitra esculenta has a {{wrinkled}} surface (similar to brainlike convolutions), not wavy or bumpy like G.infula. Gyromitra ambigua {{is very similar}} in appearance, and although it is usually not possible to discern between the two species without examining microscopic characteristics, G.ambigua {{is said to have}} more pronounced purple tints in the stipe. G.ambigua has larger spores <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> 22–30µm long. The saddle-shaped cap of G.infula might also lead to confusion with some species of Helvella, but these latter fungi typically have grayer colors and thinner, fluted stipes.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{has some}} of the Earth's oldest rocks, gneisses <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> 3.6 billion years old (80 percent as old as the planet). About 2.7 billion years ago, basaltic lava poured out of cracks in the floor of the {{primordial}} ocean; the remains of this volcanic rock formed the Canadian Shield in northeast Minnesota. The roots of these volcanic mountains and the action of Precambrian seas formed the Iron Range of northern Minnesota. Following a period of volcanism 1.1 billion years ago, Minnesota's geological activity has been more subdued, with no volcanism or mountain formation, but with repeated incursions of the sea, which left behind multiple strata of sedimentary rock.|$|E
5|$|Under a light microscope, {{the spores}} {{are seen to}} be smooth, {{elliptical}} to oblong in shape, with dimensions of 3–5 by 2–3µm. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are 4-spored, and have a narrow club-shape with dimension of 18–22 by 3.5–4.5µm. The gill cystidia are seen to stain blue when cotton blue dye and lactate are applied. The cap cuticle is made of an approximately 100µm thick layer of gelatinous hyphae <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> 2–4µm thick. The gelatinous hyphae are only present on the cap surface, not {{the surface of the}} stem; these local differences in cell structure explain the ease with which the scales are sloughed off the cap, but not the stems of the fruit bodies. The macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of the mycelia of this species grown in culture have been described in detail.|$|E

25|$|Studying the {{evolution}} of butterflies and moths is challenging, since fossils are so rare. But the few Lepidopteran fossils that exist, captured in amber or compressed in fine-grained rocks, show great detail. The earliest Lepidopteran fossils appear in rocks <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> 190 million years old. These tiny fragments of scaled wings and bodies clearly indicate that moths evolved before butterflies.|$|E
25|$|Candesartan and {{olmesartan}} {{have the}} highest affinity for the AT1 receptors, followed by irbesartan and eprosartan. Valsartan, telmisartan and EXP 3174 have similar affinities <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> ten-fold {{less than that of}} candesartan. Losartan has the least affinity. ARBs' affinity for the AT2 receptor is generally much lower (or around 10,000 times less) than for the AT1 subtype. Therefore they allow unhindered stimulation of the AT2 receptor.|$|E

25|$|Heart Mountain is an 8,123-foot (2,476 m) klippe {{just north}} of Cody in the U.S. state of Wyoming, rising {{from the floor of}} the Bighorn Basin. The {{mountain}} is composed of limestone and dolomite of Ordovician through Mississippian age (about 500 to 350 million years old), but it rests on the Willwood Formation, rocks <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> 55 million years old—rock on the summit of Heart Mountain is thus almost 300 million years older than the rocks at the base. For over one hundred years, geologists have tried to understand how these older rocks came to rest on much younger strata.|$|E
25|$|Raising the forelegs {{and holding}} the abdomen to one side {{are by no means}} {{specific}} to courtship.

In these situations, however, the spider with its forelegs raised and waving backs off while facing the moving object and, when 5–8cm away, turns away and flees.|$|E
25|$|In turn, these {{countries}} set quotas on the emissions of installations run by local business and other organizations, generically termed 'operators'. Countries manage this through their national registries, which {{are required to}} be validated and monitored for compliance by the UNFCCC. Each operator has an allowance of credits, where each unit gives the owner the right to emit one metric tonne of carbon dioxide or other equivalent greenhouse gas. Operators that have not used up their quotas can sell their unused allowances as carbon credits, while businesses <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> to exceed their quotas can buy the extra allowances as credits, privately or on the open market.|$|E

25|$|The {{mass of the}} Moon is {{sufficient}} to eliminate any voids within the interior, so it {{is believed to be}} composed of solid rock throughout. Its low bulk density (~3346kg m−3) indicates a low metal abundance. Mass and moment of inertia constraints indicate that the Moon likely has an iron core that is less than about 450km in radius. Studies of the Moon's physical librations (small perturbations to its rotation) furthermore indicate that the core is still molten. Most planetary bodies and moons have iron cores <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> half the size of the body. The Moon is thus anomalous in having a core whose size is only about one quarter of its radius.|$|E
25|$|Volcanism {{has also}} {{occurred}} in the Canadian Shield. It contains over 150 volcanic belts (now deformed and eroded down to nearly flat plains) that range from 600 million to 2.8 billion years old. Many of Canada's major ore deposits are associated with Precambrian volcanoes. There are pillow lavas in the Northwest Territories <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> 2.6 billion years old and are preserved in the Cameron River Volcanic Belt. The pillow lavas in rocks over 2 billion years old in the Canadian Shield signify that great oceanic volcanoes existed {{during the early stages}} of the formation of the Earth's crust. Ancient volcanoes play an important role in estimating Canada's mineral potential. Many of the volcanic belts bear ore deposits that are related to the volcanism.|$|E
25|$|Dispersal {{creates a}} {{relatively}} high mortality rate for sugarbeet root aphids. Additionally, alate aphids incur other disadvantages: if aphids fly then they may incur an additional cost in that their potential fecundity is further reduced {{and there is a}} further delay in the onset of reproduction. The combined effect is a marked reduction in reproductive potential and rate of increase. Although dispersal results in the colonization of suitable plants, it is not always clear what advantages there are in dispersing except from annual plants <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>about</b> to die. As dispersal can be costly in terms of fecundity or survival, or both, then sugarbeet root aphids are likely to delay departure until host quality falls below the average expectation for the habitat.|$|E
