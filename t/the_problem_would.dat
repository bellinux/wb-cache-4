5|$|Despite {{the various}} charters, the {{provision}} of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, while on other occasions <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>would</b> simply be ignored. The royal courts, which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system. Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and, ultimately, the collapse of his authority at court.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the various}} charters, the {{provision}} of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, on other occasions, <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>would</b> simply be ignored. The royal eyres, courts which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for those lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against the major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system. The power of royal sheriffs also declined during Henry's reign. They were now often lesser men appointed by the exchequer, rather than coming from important local families, and they focused on generating revenue for the King. Their robust attempts to enforce fines and collect debts generated much unpopularity among the lower classes. Unlike his father, Henry did not exploit the large debts that the barons frequently owed to the Crown, and was slow to collect any sums of money due to him.|$|E
5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun earlier {{under the direction}} of the physicist Seth Neddermeyer. Implosion used explosives to crush a subcritical sphere of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and the mass becomes a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations into implosion showed promise, but also made it clear that <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>would</b> be much more difficult from a theoretical and engineering perspective than the gun design. In September 1943, John von Neumann, who had experience with shaped charges used in armor-piercing shells, argued that not only would implosion reduce the danger of predetonation and fizzle, but would make more efficient use of the fissionable material. He proposed using a spherical configuration instead of the cylindrical one that Neddermeyer was working on.|$|E

25|$|Khan {{argued that}} for Comilla to develop rapidly, the farmers in its villages {{must be able}} to rapidly expand their {{production}} and sales.

25|$|It was in 1966 {{that the}} Network for Development Plans were issued by Barbara Castle, the Labour Minister of Transport, {{following}} a study.

25|$|Setsuna being a Kurd was an {{international}} decision by Sunrise. This was done as critique to Japan's apathy towards religion. Director Seiji Mizushima {{wanted to give}} viewers a close approach to the wars in the Middle East, believing <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>would</b> not be solved in a long time. Mizushima aimed to make the viewers understand Setsuna's feelings {{as a result of}} living under war conditions. In regards to his personality, Mizushima wanted the series' protagonist that could not be related with the audience. This was done to contrast previous Gundam protagonists and appeal to young viewers. While he saw his past as difficult to understand he might look appealing as a result. The staff also wanted to create a character the audience could relate to. Late in the series, Setsuna's Quanta system was introduced in order to convey his message that he wants war to end through communication rather than violence. This idea was explored once again in the movie where the plot was written so that nobody except Setsuna could end the conflict.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Cunningham was {{challenged}} in his re-election campaign by Scott Ott, a Republican political newcomer {{associated with the}} conservative Tea Party movement. Ott accused Cunningham of avoiding a county tax increase only by depleting a tax relief fund established during Jane Ervin's administration, leaving the county {{in a position where}} future tax hikes would be necessary. For his part, Cunningham accused Ott of using scare tactics in his campaign and said he lacked the experience to lead the county. He also argued Republican county commissioners had actually increased spending. Cunningham defeated Ott in the general election by a voter count of 21,063 to 20,201, capturing 51 percent of the vote to Ott's 49 percent. In 2010, a 16.1 percent tax increase was proposed as part of the county budget, with Cunningham said was necessary due to difficult financial times, but would avoid the need to sell assets, deplete savings, impose massive layoffs, or reduce government services to the point that <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>would</b> grow worse in subsequent years. It was the first county tax increase since 2003. The budget was ultimately passed. In 2011, Ott was elected to the county's board of commissioners in 2011, along with a slate of fellow conservatives who ran together on a ticket of reform, which heavily criticized the 16 percent county tax increase during their campaigns.|$|E

500|$|Throughout 1943, {{implosion}} {{was considered}} a backup project in case the gun-type proved impractical for some reason.
