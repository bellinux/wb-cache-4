5|$|By {{the time}} of Hamilton's early {{participation}} in the American Revolution, his abolitionist sensibilities had become evident. Hamilton was active during the Revolution in trying to raise black troops for the army, {{with the promise of}} freedom. In the 1780s and 1790s he generally opposed pro-slavery southern interests, which he saw as hypocritical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> of the American Revolution. In 1785 he joined his close associate John Jay in founding the New-York Society for Promoting the Manumission of Slaves, and Protecting Such of Them as Have Been, or May be Liberated, the main anti-slavery organization in New York. The society successfully promoted the abolition of the international slave trade in New York City and (shortly after his death) passed a state law to end slavery in New York through a decades-long process of emancipation, with a final end to slavery in the state on July 4, 1827.|$|E
5|$|In Original Stories, Wollstonecraft {{employed}} the then-burgeoning genre of children's literature {{to promote the}} education of women and an emerging middle-class ideology. She argued that women {{would be able to}} become rational adults if they were educated properly as children, which was not a widely held belief in the 18th century, and contended that the nascent middle-class ethos was superior to the court culture represented by fairy tales and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> of chance and luck found in chapbook stories for the poor. Wollstonecraft, in developing her own pedagogy, also responded to the works of the two most important educational theorists of the 18th century: John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|E

5|$|The {{lanthanides}} and actinides, in {{the metallic}} state, can exist as either divalent (such as europium and ytterbium) or trivalent (most other lanthanides) metals. The former have fn+1s2 configurations, whereas the latter have fnd1s2 configurations. In 1975, Johansson and Rosengren examined the measured and predicted {{values for the}} cohesive energies (enthalpies of crystallization) of the metallic lanthanides and actinides, both as divalent and trivalent metals. The conclusion was that the increased binding energy of the 5f136d17s2 configuration over the 5f147s2 configuration for nobelium {{was not enough to}} compensate for the energy needed to promote one 5f electron to 6d, as is true also for the very late actinides: thus einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, and nobelium were expected to be divalent metals, although for nobelium this prediction has not yet been confirmed. The increasing predominance of the divalent state well before the actinide series concludes is attributed to the relativistic stabilization of the 5f electrons, which increases with increasing atomic number: an effect of this is that nobelium is predominantly divalent instead of trivalent, unlike all the other lanthanides and actinides. In 1986, nobelium metal was estimated to have an enthalpy of sublimation between 126kJ·mol−1, a value close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> for einsteinium, fermium, and mendelevium and supporting the theory that nobelium would form a divalent metal. Like the other divalent late actinides (except the once again trivalent lawrencium), metallic nobelium should assume a face-centered cubic crystal structure. Divalent nobelium metal should have a metallic radius of around 197pm. Nobelium's melting point has been predicted to be 827°C, the same value as that estimated for the neighboring element mendelevium. Its density is predicted to be around 9.9±0.4g·cm−3.|$|E
