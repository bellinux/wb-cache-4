5|$|Logging {{settlements}} {{were established}} {{on the northern}} shore of Lake Washington in the 1860s and 1870s, relying primarily on the water for intercity transportation. The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway was built along <b>the</b> <b>lakefront</b> in 1888, connecting Seattle to the new towns of Bothell and Kenmore. By the 1890s, unpaved logging trails had been completed along Lake Washington and the railroad, reaching as far northeast as Maltby.|$|E
5|$|Fairs and {{exhibitions}} held on <b>the</b> <b>lakefront</b> sites created {{demand for}} an exhibition hall. In 1960, construction was begun on McCormick Place, a huge exposition and convention complex at 23rd Street and Lake Shore Drive named for newspaper magnate Robert R. McCormick. The original building burned in 1967, and was rebuilt and reopened in 1971 {{at the behest}} of mayor Richard J. Daley. Large expansions were added in 1986, 1997 and 2007. The current redevelopment includes greatly expanded hotel accommodation. McCormick Place also houses the Arie Crown Theater, and it is the annual location for the Chicago Auto Show.|$|E
5|$|This {{prompted}} {{the development of}} the Parliamentary Triangle, a core part of Griffin's design, and since then various buildings of national importance were constructed on <b>the</b> <b>lakefront.</b> The Australian National University was built, and sculptures and monuments were built. On average, the population of Canberra increased by more than 50% every five years between 1955 and 1975 as {{the development of the}} capital became more concerted, and new residential land was released through the creation of new town centres in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E

5|$|With {{the timber}} wolf being a species not native to Louisiana, {{there was much}} {{speculation}} {{as to what the}} relocated franchise would be called. Although never officially changed, some of the proposed names included: Rhythm from New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial and Angels from Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards. After speculation as to where the team would play their home games while a new arena was constructed, Superdome officials notified the league that enough dates would be available to schedule 41 home games at the dome for the 1994–95 season. Prior to this announcement, the team was rumored to play games at <b>the</b> <b>Lakefront</b> Arena, the Pete Maravich Assembly Center in Baton Rouge or the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in Biloxi when the Superdome was unavailable.|$|E
5|$|Within Lake Forest Park, SR522 {{is named}} Bothell Way, and follows the {{northern}} shore of Lake Washington. SR522 intersects Ballinger Way (SR104) at the city's downtown shopping center, and {{is joined by}} the Burke-Gilman Trail running along <b>the</b> <b>lakefront.</b> Bothell Way continues east along the northern shore of Lake Washington through the city of Kenmore, passing the Kenmore Air Harbor seaplane base and {{the mouth of the}} Sammamish River. SR522 travels upriver through a narrow valley that makes a sharp turn north towards Bothell. The highway turns east, passing downhill of the city's downtown business district, staying near the Sammamish River (and the Sammamish River Trail) and intersecting Bothell Way (formerly SR527). Leaving Bothell, SR522 passes around the southern edge of University of Washington Bothell campus and intersects I-405, becoming a grade-separated freeway.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the current}} {{lack of an}} Olympic stadium, Chicago has dozens of {{existing}} sport venues: Soldier Field, United Center, U.S. Cellular Field, Wrigley Field, Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Sears Centre in Hoffman Estates, and Toyota Park in Bridgeview. Venues at Loyola University Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago State University, Northern Illinois University, and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, among others, were also available and had been mentioned in early news reports as possibilities. Northerly Island and <b>the</b> <b>lakefront</b> along Lake Michigan would have hosted all beach and water events. The McCormick Place convention center, the second largest in the world, was the planned venue for indoor events like judo and weightlifting, as well as hosting all press offices, while Archery and the medals podium were slated for Grant Park.|$|E

50|$|There {{were several}} prehistoric {{settlements}} along {{what is now}} <b>the</b> Morges <b>lakefront.</b> <b>The</b> largest and best known, Grande-Cité, was occupied in the late Bronze Age. One of the wooden objects at Grande-Cité has been dendrochronologically dated to 1031 BC. Many of the stilts and building structures have been preserved in situ.

5|$|Business Loop Interstate 75 (BL I-75) is a {{business}} loop running through St. Ignace. The loop starts at exit344 on I-75 as the continuation of US Highway2 (US2) into downtown. The highway carries the Lake Huron Circle Tour (LHCT). It runs along a four-lane roadway {{on the north side}} of Straits State Park and curves northward into downtown St. Ignace along State Street. BL I-75 and three lanes and runs along <b>the</b> <b>lakefront</b> past the marina and docks for Mackinac Island ferry services. It widens back to four lanes to follow the curve of East Moran Bay and then turns inland past several hotels situated on a point jutting into the bay. North of the point, BL I-75 follows the Lake Huron shoreline past the Mackinac County Airport. North of the airport, the adjacent properties are primarily residential with a few tourist-oriented businesses. The business loop intersects County Road H-63 (Mackinac Trail) and comes to an end near Castle Rock at exit348 on I-75 in St. Ignace Township. On average each day in 2013, 4,327vehicles use the business loop near the northern I-75 interchange, and 8,819vehicles do so near the southern I-75 interchange, the lowest and highest traffic counts.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>lakefront</b> {{continually}} sees city {{proposals for}} expansion and construction, but no major construction has occurred {{since the late}} 1990s, besides the $17 million Coast Guard administrative building that opened in 2012.|$|E
25|$|In 1927 {{a project}} was begun {{to fill in}} the {{shoreline}} of Lake Pontchartrain and create levees along the lake side of the city.

25|$|The {{construction}} of The Grosse Pointe High School in 1928 marked an important transition {{in the history}} of this area along the shores of Lake St. Clair. Grosse Pointe's move away from its farming roots began after the American Civil War, when wealthy Detroit businessmen purchased much of <b>the</b> <b>lakefront</b> property for summer homes. By 1900, year-round mansions were rapidly replacing seasonal residences, and a sense of community began to form.|$|E

25|$|A lasting {{environmental}} impact after construction is the improved {{access to the}} Lake Ontario waterfront within the City of Toronto. The original rail corridor was a major physical barrier between the downtown and <b>the</b> <b>lakefront</b> where continuous residential, recreational and business developments are occurring. The tunnel reduces the length of vehicular travel time and associated carbon emissions, and the new ease of access promotes carbon-free travel, i.e., bicycling and walking.|$|E
25|$|The {{geography}} of the lake shore is greatly changed since the first settlement of Toronto. Much of the land {{on the north shore}} of the harbour is landfill, filled in during the late 19th century. Until then, <b>the</b> <b>lakefront</b> docks (then known as wharves) were set back farther inland than today. Much of the adjacent Port Lands {{on the east side of}} the harbour was a wetland filled in early in the 20th century. The shoreline from the harbour west to the Humber River has been extended into the lake. Further west, landfill has created extensions of land such as Humber Bay Park.|$|E
25|$|Major {{sections}} of the city include the central business district, called The Loop, and the North, the South, and West Sides.

On a 9–6 vote, the council approved a measure that established the project's $124 million capital budget, its estimated $3.2 million operating and maintenance budget and its 2.5-mile route, which includes a lakefront spur connecting the line to the proposed $122 million, 44-story Couture. Construction on the Milwaukee Streetcar will start March 2017, with initial operation by mid-2018. <b>The</b> <b>Lakefront</b> service is expected to start operation by 2019.|$|E
