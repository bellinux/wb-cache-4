Worried, Claire calls her friend Andre (Warfield), who assures her {{that he has not}} told anything to the police. She continues to be battered by Cassidy on her background, and admits that she was born out of wedlock when her mother was only 16 years old. Cassidy then displays <b>the</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> her phone call with Andre, but Claire connects the phone call yet again with her mother. She insists that she was taking a walk in the city around the time that Jackson was murdered, and reenacts the walk with Cassidy to prove it. Around this time, Cassidy proclaims his attraction towards her, and explains that he has made a serious mistake in his career past before, and cannot afford to be wrong again. They kiss afterwards.|$|R
5000|$|In her {{statement}} Leadsom said [...] "the interests {{of our country}} are best served by the immediate appointment of a strong and well-supported prime minister. I am therefore withdrawing from the leadership election, and I wish Mrs May the very greatest success." [...] However, her campaign manager, MP Tim Loughton spoke about an [...] "onslaught of often very personal attacks from colleagues and journalists" [...] as well as [...] "underhand tactics against decent people". Leadsom had certainly been {{under pressure from the}} news media, with reports criticising her exaggeration of business and management experience and her suggestion that motherhood strengthened her candidacy for Prime Minister. Leadsom charged The Times with [...] "gutter journalism" [...] in response to the article about the motherhood issue. The Times subsequently released <b>the</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interview to confirm Leadsom's statement.

50|$|She came to {{national}} prominence after discovering <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>of</b> telephone calls between high level Italian politicians and Stefano Ricucci and Gianpiero Fiorani.

Italian journalists have speculated that this could reflect {{a new way of}} bribing politicians.|$|R
25|$|Relegation {{continued}} in 1994 and 1995; but in 1996 a different pre-selection system was used, in which nearly all <b>the</b> countries participated. <b>Audio</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> songs {{were sent to}} juries {{in each of the}} countries some weeks before the television show.

40|$|This study uses {{focus group}} discussions {{as a means}} for {{understanding}} the role of ethics in the decision making processes of student affairs professionals. A second purpose of the study is to consider the method of the focus group discussion itself as a means to enable dialogue and conversation among student affairs professionals about ethical issues. ^ The problem is explored through four research questions: (1) Do ethical considerations enter into the decision making processes utilized by student affairs professionals? (2) How do actual decision making processes as described by the student affairs professionals relate to prescriptions for ethical decision making in the literature? (3) To what extent is an ethic of caring exhibited? (4) Does the focus group forum itself contribute to developing a campus environment which promotes dialogue on ethical decision making?^ In this study, 26 staff at the University of Southern Maine participated in three focus group discussions. The participants were grouped according to position level: entry-level, mid-level, and director level. The discussion topics designed for the moderator 2 ̆ 7 s outline included two hypothetical case situations, as well as opportunities to discuss real work situations. Data were gathered from <b>the</b> transcription <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discussions, and analyzed in relation to the research questions. Data specific to research question four were also gathered from responses to a follow-up questionnaire administered one month after the focus group interviews. ^ The findings suggest that ethical considerations do enter into the decision making processes of the student affairs staff. The focus group discussions were shown to be a valuable intervention for a campus. The method can help produce an environment which is conducive to dialogue on important matters and in which considerations of ethics are perceived as valuable. Additional findings suggest that organizational considerations {{are an important part of}} the decision making processes of the student affairs participants. Regularized focus group discussion among student affairs staff can serve to promote such dialogue in the larger campus community, and therefore is an important step towards the development of an appropriate institutional environment for ethical decision making. ...|$|R

500|$|On October 1, 2012, Universal {{released}} a 6-CD box {{set of the}} album, intended as its definitive edition. It features the previously available mono and stereo mixes as discs one and two. Disc one contains as bonus tracks additional alternate versions of [...] "All Tomorrow's Parties", [...] "European Son", [...] "Heroin", [...] "All Tomorrow's Parties" [...] (alternate instrumental version), and [...] "I'll Be Your Mirror". Disc two contains the same bonus tracks as the prior deluxe version's second disc. Disc three is Nico's Chelsea Girl in its entirety and the Scepter Studios acetate (see below) in its entirety occupies disc 4. Discs 5 and 6 contain a previously unreleased live performance from 1966. According to the essay by music critic and historian Richie Unterberger contained within the set, the source for the show is <b>the</b> only <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> acceptable quality recording during singer Nico's tenure in the band. The essay also clarifies {{that the absence of}} any DVD materials in the box set {{is due to the fact}} that none of the band's shows were filmed, in spite of their heavy reliance on multimedia visuals.|$|R

Appointments to the Regulatory Agencies: The Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (1949 - 1974), examined regulatory appointments over 25 years and five administrations. Inclusive dates for the INSPIRE Records span from 1935 to 1976, although the bulk of the material dates from 1973 to 1976. The collection contains published information and unpublished information on the men and women appointed to the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission from 1949 to 1974 including among others, Joseph Califano, Benjamin Hooks, Nicholas Johnson, Newton Minow and Caspar Weinberger. One part of the collection includes materials copied from the files of the Senate Committee on Commerce at the National Archives, the House Oversight & Investigations Subcommittee, the Harry S.

2500|$|Simpson made an incriminating {{statement}} to police about cutting his finger {{the night of}} the murders. First {{he said that he had}} accidentally cut his finger with a shard of broken glass in his Chicago hotel room, then changed his story minutes later. He said he cut his finger in Los Angeles, then said that the cut re-opened while he was in Chicago. Later he claimed not to remember at all how he received the cut on his left middle finger. Bugliosi took Clark and Darden to task for not allowing the jury to hear <b>the</b> police <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> this statement. Bugliosi also said the prosecutors should have gone into more detail about Simpson's abuse of his wife. He said it should have been made clear to the mostly African-American jury that Simpson had little influence in the black community. Unlike some other prominent athletes, he had done nothing to help blacks less fortunate than he. Bugliosi pointed out that, although the prosecutors understood that Simpson's race had nothing to do with the murders, once the defense [...] "opened the door" [...] by trying to paint Simpson falsely as a leader in the black community who might have been framed by an overzealous prosecution looking for a suspect, the prosecution should have presented the evidence to the contrary. This might have influenced the jury's verdict. Bugliosi also criticized the prosecution's closing statements as inadequate.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} training {{interviews conducted}} {{as a part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Video and <b>Audio</b> <b>Taping</b> <b>of</b> Evidence (VATE) project run by the Victorian Police Force. Transcriptions of seven video-taped interviews between police officers and children aged eight to eleven years formed the corpus of data for this study. Adopting an Interactional Sociolinguistics framework {{in order to examine}} certain discourse features of the interviews, {{it was found that the}} data could not be classified as typical of police institutional discourse such as that described by Auburn, Drake and Willig (1995 : 384) and Thomas (1989 : 137). Features such as frames and participant roles in the interviews as well as discoursal indicators (Thomas 1989) indicate an asymmetrical discourse structure said to be typical of institutional talk. However, other features of the data such as receipt markers (Atkinson 1992) were found to be indicative of a less formal style of discourse where such asymmetry is less common. Thus it was concluded that the notion of institutional discourse as asymmetrical discourse with asymmetrical patterns is problematicized by data such as that analyzed here...|$|R
