5|$|Contemporary Mangalorean Catholics are descended {{mainly from}} Goan Catholics who {{migrated}} to South Canara between 1560 and 1763, {{throughout the course}} of the Goa Inquisition, Portuguese–Adil Shahi wars, and the Portuguese–Maratha wars. They learned the languages of South Canara, Tulu, and Kannada, but retained Konkani as their mother tongue and preserved <b>their</b> <b>lifestyle.</b> Their 15-year captivity at Seringapatam imposed by Tipu Sultan, the de facto ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore, from 24 February 1784 to 4 May 1799 led to the near extinction of the community. After Tipu's defeat and subsequent killing by the British in 1799, the community resettled in South Canara, and later prospered under British rule.|$|E

5|$|In 1526, Portuguese ships {{arrived in}} Mangalore, {{and the number}} of local {{converts}} to Christianity slowly increased. However, a sizeable Christian population did not exist there until {{the second half of the}} 16th century, when there was a large-scale immigration of Christians from Goa to South Canara. They were reluctant to learn the local languages of South Canara and continued to speak Konkani, the language they brought from Goa, so that local Christians had to learn Konkani to converse with them. After this migration, the skilled Goan Catholic agriculturists were offered various land grants by the native Bednore rulers of South Canara. They observed their traditional Hindu customs in conjunction with the newfound Catholic practices, and preserved <b>their</b> <b>lifestyle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, NBC {{has hired}} {{recently}} laid off investment bankers (Patrick Heusinger, Greg Tuculescu, and Doug Mand) from Lehman Brothers as interns on TGS with Tracy Jordan. Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{is invited to}} go out on the town with them, but finds that he is incapable of keeping up with <b>their</b> <b>lifestyle.</b> Tracy fears that if the public were to learn that he no longer lives a fast lifestyle, his image would be severely compromised and he would be forced to change from a comedic actor to a dramatic actor. Tracy refuses to allow this to happen, so he buys out Lehman Brothers and sends the interns back to their old jobs on Wall Street.|$|E
5|$|Morikawa Kaichirō {{identifies}} the subculture as distinctly Japanese, {{a product of}} the school system and society. Japanese schools have a class structure which functions as a caste system, but clubs are an exception to the social hierarchy. In these clubs, a student's interests will be recognized and nurtured, catering to the interests of otaku. Secondly, the vertical structure of Japanese society {{identifies the}} value of individuals by their success. Until the late 1980s, unathletic and unattractive males focused on academics, hoping to secure a good job and marry to raise their social standing. Those unable to succeed socially focused instead on their interests, often into adulthood, with <b>their</b> <b>lifestyle</b> centering on those interests, furthering the creation of the otaku subculture.|$|E

5|$|These organisms {{appear to}} form two groups: the fractal rangeomorphs and the simpler erniettomorphs. Including such fossils as the iconic Charnia and Swartpuntia, {{the group is}} both the most iconic of the Ediacaran biota and the most {{difficult}} to place within the existing tree of life. Lacking any mouth, gut, reproductive organs, or indeed any evidence of internal anatomy, <b>their</b> <b>lifestyle</b> was somewhat peculiar by modern standards; the most widely accepted hypothesis holds that they sucked nutrients out of the surrounding seawater by osmotrophy or osmosis. However, others argue against this.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Rowland officially became {{ambassador}} for MTV's Staying Alive Foundation, {{which aims to}} reduce stigma against people living with HIV and AIDS. She visited projects in Tanzania and Kenya to promote the charity, and underwent an HIV test in Africa {{to raise awareness of}} the disease. In 2009, Rowland connected with Serve.MTV.com, MTV's platform to connect young people with local volunteerism opportunities, for a series of on-air PSAs. From battling homelessness to beautifying impoverished neighborhoods to saving whales, Rowland was joined by the likes of Cameron Diaz, will.i.am, and Sean Kingston as they discuss causes they volunteer to support, and urge young people to join with their friends in making civic service a part of <b>their</b> <b>lifestyle.</b> That same year, she spearheaded a bone marrow drive, and joined fellow singers Alesha Dixon and Pixie Lott to create T-shirts for River Island in aid of the Prince's Trust, profits from which help change young lives.|$|E
5|$|SAH {{is often}} {{associated}} with a poor outcome. The death rate (mortality) for SAH is between 40 and 50 percent, but trends for survival are improving. Of those that survive hospitalization, more than a quarter have significant restrictions in <b>their</b> <b>lifestyle,</b> and less than a fifth have no residual symptoms whatsoever. Delay in diagnosis of minor SAH (mistaking the sudden headache for migraine) contributes to poor outcome. Factors found on admission that are associated with poorer outcome include poorer neurological grade; systolic hypertension; a previous diagnosis of heart attack or SAH; liver disease; more blood and larger aneurysm on the initial CT scan; location of an aneurysm in the posterior circulation; and higher age. Factors that carry a worse prognosis during the hospital stay include occurrence of delayed ischemia resulting from vasospasm, development of intracerebral hematoma, or intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding into the ventricles of the brain) and presence of fever on the eighthday of admission.|$|E

5|$|A sexual {{harassment}} lawsuit was filed against Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{in the previous}} episode, and she must take a {{sexual harassment}} training as a result. In addition, she cannot return to work until she is done with her training. Liz, however, cannot handle life without work, as she needs the stress. Her attitude changes when she meets one of her neighbors, Emily (Elizabeth Marvel). She understands how Liz feels because she was just like Liz and tells her there are better ways to live. Liz hangs out with Emily and her friends (Mary Catherine Garrison, Kerry Butler, and Christina Gausas), who spend majority of their time getting spa treatments and going shopping. Liz gets {{so caught up in}} <b>their</b> <b>lifestyle</b> that she forgets to watch her show, The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS). Not wanting to come back to work—as she is intrigued by her new friends' lifestyle—Liz sexually harasses her counselor, Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane). She goes back to hanging out with Emily and her friends, but soon discovers that they are a Girl Fight Club, which disappoints Liz. In order for her to get out, Liz needs to fight them.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} rarity of what surfers {{consider}} truly perfect surf conditions (due to changing weather and surf condition) {{and the inevitable}} hunt for great waves, surfers often become dedicated to their sport {{in a way that}} precludes a more traditional life.

25|$|The {{most common}} {{treatment}} plans involve {{a schedule of}} physical therapy with a medication regimen.

25|$|During the Victorian Era, a woman's {{place was}} at home. Unlike {{in the earlier}} centuries when women could help their husbands and {{brothers}} in family businesses, in the nineteenth century, the gender roles became more defined than ever.

25|$|Thus, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} Singapore had already experimented using campaigns as a means of {{encouraging}} Singaporeans to acquire a more courteous disposition in <b>their</b> <b>lifestyle.</b> Nonetheless, the forerunner of the National Courtesy Campaign is usually recognised as the courtesy campaign that was conducted by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB).|$|E

25|$|Despite these unromantic circumstances, {{the couple}} settled {{amicably}} in Hanover (where {{the cost of}} living was much lower than in England), and by all accounts were devoted to each other throughout their marriage. Adelaide improved William's behaviour; he drank less, swore less and became more tactful. Observers thought them parsimonious, and <b>their</b> <b>lifestyle</b> simple, even boring. William eventually accepted the reduced increase in his allowance voted by Parliament.|$|E
25|$|The Latin American populations {{exhibit a}} high {{prevalence}} of abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome, similar or even higher than developed countries. It {{is attributed to}} changes in <b>their</b> <b>lifestyle,</b> migration from rural to urban areas and a higher susceptibility to accumulate abdominal fat and develop more insulin resistance compared to other ethnically different populations. Some genetic factors and metabolic adaptations during fetal life can be claimed as etiological factors of this condition.|$|E
25|$|For some time, the Prince {{saw little}} of Langtry.

With the withdrawal of royal favour, creditors closed in. The Langtrys' finances were not equal to <b>their</b> <b>lifestyle.</b> In October 1880, Langtry sold many of her possessions to meet her debts, allowing Edward Langtry to avoid a declaration of bankruptcy.|$|E
