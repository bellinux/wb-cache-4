25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rundown</b> of {{the fleet}} started in 2001, when the {{locomotives}} were replaced on charter and mail trains by Class 67 or Class 90 locomotives. They saw continued use with Virgin Trains, however, but were gradually withdrawn as new Class 390 Pendolino units entered service, reducing the need for hired locomotives. By {{the end of their}} working careers, most of the EWS locomotives were in an appalling state and suffered from numerous failures. The final locomotives, nos. 86210/401/424 were withdrawn from traffic in late 2002.|$|E
25|$|Colonel DeLand {{tried to}} impose {{discipline}} on the disorderly camp but was frustrated by its poor condition and corrupt guards, including especially those {{from his own}} regiment. Because only two water hydrants were available to the prisoners, they had {{to wait in the}} cold for hours to get water. Open sinks (latrines), or sewers, ran through the middle of the camp. <b>The</b> <b>rundown</b> buildings provided inadequate shelter. Hospital capacity, with 120 beds for prisoners and 50 beds for guards, was seriously inadequate. The post chapel was converted into hospital space, but there was still insufficient capacity for all the sick prisoners and guards.|$|E

Sirota also guest hosted for Thom Hartmann and Norman Goldman. On July 16, 2012, Sirota moved to sister station KHOW to co-host an afternoon drive program with former George W.

25|$|The {{project had}} been {{proposed}} {{in part to}} stave off blight and economic downturn in the area due to the 1970s fiscal crisis, which had led city officials {{to try to prevent}} Fordham University from relocating out of the borough and into Westchester County, in addition to declare Fordham Road the northern boundary of the South Bronx to reduce the stigma of Fordham being associated with <b>the</b> <b>rundown</b> South Bronx. While construction was planned to be completed by mid-1977, it was delayed by negotiations with the Postal Service (who were asking $8 million for the sale of the site after paying $1.8 million a decade earlier), and ultimately stopped in 1981 when the application for federal funds for the project was frozen.|$|E
25|$|By 1966 {{they began}} to be painted in {{corporate}} Rail Blue with yellow ends, the change generally coinciding with a works repair and the fitting of air brake equipment, the locomotives originally having only vacuum braking (the first so treated was D9002; the last to be painted blue was D9014). In the early 1970s they were fitted with Electric Train Heating (ETH) equipment to power {{the new generation of}} air-conditioned coaches, while a couple of years later, with the introduction of BR's TOPS computer system, they were renumbered 55 001 to 55 022. In 1979, Finsbury Park restored the white cab window surrounds to their remaining six Deltics, making them distinctive, although these were later painted over when the locomotives were transferred to York during <b>the</b> <b>rundown</b> of the depot at Finsbury Park.|$|E
25|$|During {{the rest}} of the 20th century, commercialization {{patterns}} for food and other staples were strongly influenced by the United States, with the introduction of concepts such as supermarkets and convenience stores. The current retail situation in Mexican cities varies widely. On one end, there are a myriad of small corner stores (called mesceláneas, expendios de abarrotes or tienditas) and on the other are major supermarket and department chains such as Comercial Mexicana, Wal Mart, Liverpool and others. These types of markets now account for eighty percent of food sales in Mexico City. The appearance of supermarkets has diminished the sales in many markets. For example, sales at the market in Colonia Industrial were cut by half when a supermarket opened nearby in 2009. Although mercados usually have better prices and fresher produce, <b>the</b> <b>rundown</b> conditions of many is one factor why many consumers prefer supermarkets.|$|E

500|$|Using his {{experience}} from visiting New York {{in the same}} time period in which the film's story took place, Scott sought to downplay a [...] "Beatles" [...] atmosphere to the film and to instead create a shabbier atmosphere, saying that [...] "Harlem was really, really shabby, beautiful brownstones falling apart." [...] Production and costume design was emphasized, transforming the location into <b>the</b> <b>rundown</b> streets of upper Manhattan from the late 1960s and early 1970s.

500|$|An {{investigation}} by the New York Press asked a number of independent doctors about the evidence for the Purification Rundown. None of them endorsed the program's effectiveness and some explicitly described it as dangerous. Several said that no peer-reviewed research on <b>the</b> <b>rundown</b> had been published in any medical journal. Some apparently supportive studies have been published, but these lack control groups and have other scientific failings. According to Deputy Fire Commissioner Frank Gribbon, doctors investigating the program {{on behalf of the}} Fire Department concluded that it was not detoxifying. University of Georgia bioterrorism expert Cham Dallas also denied that the procedure could detoxify, saying [...] "It sounds great and they mean well, but it just doesn't work." ...|$|E

Although <b>the</b> <b>rundown</b> shop gets little business, there are some repeat customers; for instance, Mrs. Siddie Shiva shops almost daily for flower {{arrangements}} for her many relatives' funerals. Another regular customer is Burson Fouch, who eats the plants he buys for lunch. When Seymour fouls up the arrangement of Dr. Farb, a sadistic dentist, Mushnick fires him. Hoping Mushnick will change his mind, Seymour tells him about a special plant that he crossbred from a butterwort and a Venus flytrap. Bashfully, Seymour admits that he named the plant [...] "Audrey Jr.", a revelation that delights the real Audrey.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "detoxification" [...] {{program was}} created by L. Ron Hubbard, who set out the {{procedure}} in Clear Body, Clear Mind, one of the canonical texts of Scientology. Known as the [...] "Purification rundown" [...] or [...] "Purif," [...] it is promoted through various groups affiliated with the Church of Scientology, including Narconon drug rehabilitation and the Second Chance Program. It claims to flush poisons from the body's fat stores using exercise, saunas, and high doses of vitamins, particularly niacin. Medical professionals have judged it to be unproven, ineffective and/or potentially dangerous. A report for the Department of Health in California described the mega-doses of vitamins as [...] "hazardous" [...] and [...] "in some cases lethal." [...] Scientology's own literature reports dehydration, electrolyte disturbances including hyponatremia (low sodium level) and hypokalemia (low potassium level), and heat-related illnesses as being frequent side-effects of the program. Testimonials from some participants credit it with improvements in physical and mental health, but several families blame <b>the</b> <b>Rundown</b> {{for the death of}} a relative.|$|E
500|$|During {{his first}} year at the Liverpool College of Art, Sutcliffe worked as a bin man on the Liverpool Corporation's waste {{collection}} trucks. Lennon was introduced to Sutcliffe by Bill Harry, a mutual friend, when all three were studying at the Liverpool College of Art. According to Lennon, Sutcliffe had a [...] "marvellous art portfolio" [...] and was a very talented painter {{who was one of the}} [...] "stars" [...] of the school. He helped Lennon to improve his artistic skills, and with others, worked with him when Lennon had to submit work for exams. Sutcliffe shared a flat with Murray at 9 Percy Street, Liverpool, before being evicted and moving to Hillary Mansions at 3 Gambier Terrace, where another art student lived, Margaret Chapman, who competed with Sutcliffe to be the best painter in class. The flat was opposite the new Anglican cathedral in <b>the</b> <b>rundown</b> area of Liverpool 8, with bare lightbulbs and a mattress on the floor in the corner. Lennon moved in with Sutcliffe in early 1960. (Paul McCartney later admitted that he was jealous of Sutcliffe's relationship with Lennon, as he had to take a [...] "back seat" [...] to Sutcliffe). Sutcliffe and his flatmates painted the rooms yellow and black, which their landlady did not appreciate. On another occasion the tenants, needing to keep warm, burned the flat's furniture.|$|E
