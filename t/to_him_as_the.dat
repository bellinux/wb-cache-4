5|$|Bhikshatana is {{a popular}} icon in South India, in {{contrast}} to North India, where it is of lesser importance. Though Bhikshatana {{does not have any}} temples dedicated <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> primary deity, he is sculpted in stone temple walls, worshipped as a subsidiary deity, and cast in bronze as a temple festival processional icon in almost every major Tamil Shiva temple. Many Tamil language hymns sing of Bhikshatana's wanderings, often narrating of the pining of the love-smitten who are enamoured of him.|$|E
5|$|Payne's patrol retreated without {{destroying}} the tank, taking Shadrick's body {{with them as}} the only casualty. The force returned to the 34th Infantry Command post in Pyongtaek to report to Brigadier General George B. Barth and Colonel Harold B. Ayres, who were commanding the troops in the town. Also present was Marguerite Higgins, a war correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune. Higgins subsequently reported Shadrick's death, referring <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> first American killed in the Korean War.|$|E

5|$|During {{a congressional}} recess in July 1878, Hayes finally sacked Arthur and Cornell (Sharpe's term had expired) and {{appointed}} replacements. When Congress reconvened, Sherman pressured his former Senate colleagues {{to confirm the}} President's replacement nominees, which they did after considerable debate. Jay and other reformers criticized Sherman the next year when he traveled to New York to speak on Cornell's behalf in his campaign for governor of New York. Sherman replied {{that it was important}} that the Republican party win the election there, despite their intra-party differences. His friendliness may also have related, as Arthur's biographer Thomas C. Reeves suggests, to a desire to keep Conkling's New York machine friendly <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 1880 presidential election approached.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1787, the {{convention}} received a tentative draft {{written by a}} Committee of Detail chaired by South Carolina's John Rutledge; Randolph had represented Virginia. The draft was acceptable to Mason {{as a basis for}} discussion, containing such points important <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> requirement that money bills originate in the House and not be amendable in the Senate. Nevertheless, Mason felt the upper house was too powerful, as it had the powers to make treaties, appoint Supreme Court justices, and adjudicate territorial disputes between the states. The draft lacked provision for a council of revision, something Mason and others considered a serious lack.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{broke down}} {{once more in}} 1067 with the {{ascension}} of Emperor Shenzong of Song, and in the 1070s the Song had considerable success in capturing Tangut territory. A mood of frontier adventurism permeated Shenzong's court, {{as well as a}} desire to reclaim territories he felt belonged <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> rightful ruler of China; when a Song general led an unprovoked attack on a Western Xia border town, Shenzong appeared at the border to commend the general himself. To punish the Western Xia and damage their economy, Emperor Shenzong also shut down all commercial border markets along the Song-Western Xia border. The scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095) was sent to Yanzhou (now Yan'an, Shaanxi province) in 1080 to stave off Tangut military invasion. He successfully defended his fortified position, yet the new Grand Councillor Cai Que held him {{responsible for the death of}} a rival Song military officer and the decimation of that officer's forces; as a result, Shen Kuo was ousted from office and the state abandoned the projected land that Shen was able to defend.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} the nomination, Kemp became the ticket's spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to {{agreement on the}} self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March, Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic, and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described {{as if he was}} the Presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemp's style, referring <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as U.S. News & World Report writer Steven V. Roberts, criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills. During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemp's voice on minority issues, Colin Powell's support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer, school vouchers and criminal justice, the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{manage to}} sneak in {{backstage}} at the concert, where Miley asks why they're here. Brian then explains that Stewie has a 'tumor' shaped like a football, which convinces Miley to let them hang out with her backstage. Miley and Stewie quickly become best friends and they sing a song which Stewie wrote. Soon, Chris realizes that the Monkey has {{spent more time with}} him, like taking him to play baseball and going to a father and son BBQ in Monkeykid. Chris then says to Peter that he has never gave as much attention <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> monkey has, so he grows to resent his own father. While having ice-cream with Miley, Stewie notices a signal interference on her cell phone when handing it to her. He then realises something is strange about Miley. Upon spying on her, Stewie and Brian discover that she is actually an android after seeing an employee insert a USB drive on the control panel on Miley's back. They both realized that Miley was created by Walt Disney Imagineering to become the perfect teen idol that can never fail. When Brian curiously asks if she can perform other tasks, Stewie agrees to reprogram Miley to have sex with Brian by gaining access to the control panel. However, it goes wrong and he accidentally sends Miley into a rage, forcing Stewie and Brian to run away from the monstrous Miley.|$|E
5|$|By the 38th lap, {{drivers who}} made their stops during the safety car period entered into their {{electrical}} energy conservation phase. Andretti chose {{to allow their}} drivers {{to remain on the}} circuit {{for as long as possible}} and their strategy allowed Félix da Costa and Frijns to catch and overtake d'Ambrosio and Turvey for the fifth and sixth positions in the event's closing period. Félix da Costa then attempted to catch the fourth-placed Prost but was unable to get close <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> field began the final lap, di Grassi, Heidfeld and Prost had five percent of usage electrical energy remaining and Buemi was unchallenged for the remainder of the race to secure the victory. Di Grassi finished second, ahead of Heidfeld in third. Prost was fourth and Félix da Costa fifth. Frijns, d'Ambrosio, Turvey, Engel and Sarrazin rounded out the top ten points-scoring positions. Piquet, Carroll filled the next two positions. Bird was fast enough to unlap himself by passing the race leaders, despite spinning his tyres at the circuit's low-speed exit turns, and finished in 13th. Duval and Rosenqvist were the last of the classified finishers. It was Buemi's first victory of the season and the seventh of his career. There were three lead changes in the race; four drivers reached the front of the field. Buemi led once for a total of 20 laps, more than any other competitor. Of the two other retirements, Vergne stopped with an overheating battery, and Abt lost all electrical energy in his car after 34 laps.|$|E

5|$|That same year, Brian Hodgson, who {{had spent}} many years in Nepal serving as the Assistant Resident, and who had a good {{knowledge}} about Nepal's bio-diversity, culture, and politics, became the new British Resident. Although the British Residents were officially instructed {{to keep out of}} the internal politics of Nepal, the Resident was courted by both the King as well as the Mukhtiyar. Hodgson was waiting for an opportunity to exploit the rift between the Mukhtiyar and the royal family and begin a more aggressive campaign to increase British influence and trading opportunities. Hodgson also believed the large standing army to be a security threat and that the border tensions could be pacified if the King was directly in control, rather than a mukhtiyar who needed to keep {{on the right side of}} the army. By 1834, Hodgson had come to a conclusion that he would not be able to have his way so long as Bhimsen was in control of the Nepalese administration; thus he strongly sympathized with the Pande faction, and he wished to install Fateh Jung Shah, who was more favorably disposed <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> mukhtiyar. In August 1834, Hodgson proposed to conduct a new commercial treaty between Nepal and Britain, which Bhimsen in principle agreed to but disagreed with several of the clauses. At a time when his authority was diminishing, Bhimsen could not afford to antagonize the Resident; but at the same time, he could not accept his proposals and be seen as subservient to the British by the Nepalese court. Nevertheless, he tried to maintain a friendly and conciliatory attitude toward the Resident, in order to win him as his ally, by loosening the restrictions on his movements and granting direct access to the King.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} one is known as Maha Devale or Maha Kovil and is dedicated to Skanda-Murugan known amongst the Sinhalese as Kataragama deviyo. It {{does not have a}} statute of the deity; instead it holds a Yantra, a spiritual drawing of the deity's power. Of all the shrines in the complex, it is the largest and the first that all pilgrims come to visit. Although it does not have a representation of the deity, kept in an adjoining room is a statue of Shiva also known amongst Sinhalese as Karanduva. Within it there is a clay arm chair known as Kalana Mandima that supposedly belonged to Kalyanagiri Swamy. It is covered by a leopard’s skin and on it has all the ceremonial instruments. To the left of the main shrine lies a smaller shrine dedicated to Hindu god Ganesha who is known as Ganapatidevio amongst Sinhalese. Tamils refer <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Manica Pillaiyar as well. It too is a small rectangular building without any decoration. To the left of Ganesha shrine stands the Vishnu Devale the shrine dedicated to Vishnu within which there is also a Buddha image. Behind this is a large Bo tree that tradition holds as sprung from the sapling of the original Bo tree in Anuradhapura, hence is very much held in high esteem by the visiting Buddhists.|$|E

25|$|He {{could not}} {{replicate}} this administrative policy everywhere in his far flung empire, however.
