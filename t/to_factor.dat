5|$|Normal {{coagulation}} is {{initiated by}} the release of tissue factor from damaged tissue. Tissue factor binds to circulating factor VIIa. The combination activates factor X <b>to</b> <b>factor</b> Xa and factor IX <b>to</b> <b>factor</b> IXa. Factor Xa (in the presence of factor V) activates prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin is a central enzyme in the coagulation process: it generates fibrin from fibrinogen, and activates {{a number of other}} enzymes and cofactors (factor XIII, factor XI, factor V and factor VIII, TAFI) that enhance the fibrin clot. The process is inhibited by TFPI (which inactivates the first step catalyzed by factor VIIa/tissue factor), antithrombin (which inactivates thrombin, factor IXa, Xa and XIa), protein C (which inhibits factors Va and VIIIa in the presence of protein S), and protein Z (which inhibits factor Xa).|$|E
5|$|By March, Clarke's {{deception}} operations {{had grown}} {{and it was}} decided to create a formal department. He chose the name Advanced Headquarters 'A' Force - the 'A' being a subtle reference to airborne - in the hope that it would help support the existence of paratroopers in the area (as well as hide the true purpose of the department). Clarke continued actively promoting the existence of 1st SAS until around June 1941, and it appears that Axis commanders accepted the brigade as real. Clarke had created the unit with no specific aims, although it did mean that the enemy command had <b>to</b> <b>factor</b> the existence of airborne troops into any battle plan. However, Abeam and the 1st SAS represented his first attempt at inflating the apparent strength of Allied forces, a tactic he would use significantly over the rest of the war. The brigade occasionally featured in Clarke's tactical deceptions; such as a March 1941 threat to Axis supply lines near Tripoli.|$|E

The Directive established a 10% biofuel target. A separate Fuel Quality Directive set the EU's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, requiring a 6% reduction in GHG intensity of EU transport fuels by 2020. The legislation ordered the European Commission to develop a methodology <b>to</b> <b>factor</b> in GHG emissions from ILUC by December 31, 2010, based on the best available scientific evidence.|$|E
5|$|The {{mortality}} rate from paracetamol overdose increases {{two days after}} the ingestion, reaches a maximum on day four, and then gradually decreases. Acidosis is the most important single indicator of probable mortality and the need for transplantation. A {{mortality rate}} of 95% without transplant was reported in patients who had a documented pH less than 7.30. Other indicators of poor prognosis include renal insufficiency (stage3 or worse), hepatic encephalopathy, a markedly elevated prothrombin time, or an elevated blood lactic acid level (lactic acidosis). One study has shown that a factor V level less than 10% of normal indicated a poor prognosis (91% mortality), whereas a ratio of factor VIII <b>to</b> <b>factor</b> V of less than 30 indicated a good prognosis (100% survival). Patients with a poor prognosis are usually identified for likely liver transplantation. Patients that do not die are expected to fully recover and have a normal life expectancy and quality of life.|$|E

25|$|Antithrombin (AT) {{is a small}} protein {{molecule}} that inactivates several enzymes of the coagulation system. Antithrombin is a glycoprotein produced by the liver and consists of 432 amino acids. It contains three disulfide bonds {{and a total of}} four possible glycosylation sites. α-Antithrombin is the dominant form of antithrombin found in blood plasma and has an oligosaccharide occupying each of its four glycosylation sites. A single glycosylation site remains consistently un-occupied in the minor form of antithrombin, β-antithrombin. Its activity is increased manyfold by the anticoagulant drug heparin, which enhances the binding of antithrombin <b>to</b> <b>factor</b> IIa (Thrombin) and factor Xa.|$|E
25|$|Tissue factor also binds <b>to</b> <b>factor</b> VII in the blood, which initiates the {{extrinsic}} coagulation cascade {{to increase}} thrombin production. Thrombin {{is a potent}} platelet activator, acting through Gq and G12. These are G protein coupled receptors and they turn on calcium mediated signaling pathways within the platelet, overcoming the baseline calcium efflux. Families of three G proteins (Gq, Gi, G12) operate together for full activation. Thrombin also promotes secondary fibrin-reinforcement of the platelet plug. Platelet activation in turn degranulates and releases factor V and fibrinogen, potentiating the coagulation cascade. So in reality the process of platelet plugging and coagulation are occurring simultaneously rather than sequentially, with each inducing the other to form the final clot.|$|E

40|$|The common {{assumptions}} that labor income share {{does not change}} over time or across countries and that factor income shares are equal to the elasticity of output with respect <b>to</b> <b>factors</b> have had important implications for economic theory. However, there are several theoretical reasons for why the elasticity of output with respect <b>to</b> reproducible <b>factors</b> should be correlated with the stage of development. In particular, the behavior {{of international trade and}} capital flows and the existence of factor saving innovations imply such a correlation. If this correlation exists and if factor income shares are equal to the elasticity of output with respect <b>to</b> <b>factors</b> then the labor income share must be negatively correlated with the stage of development. The existence of a labor intensive sector that produces non-tradable goods would explain why labor income share has no correlation with income per capita.
