50|$|Fucus serratus is a seaweed of {{the north}} Atlantic Ocean, known as <b>toothed</b> <b>wrack</b> or {{serrated}} wrack.|$|E
50|$|F. serratus, <b>toothed</b> <b>wrack,</b> is {{the most}} {{distinctive}} of all the Fucus species. It clearly shows a distinctive serrated edge to the frond not shown by the other species of the genus.|$|E
5000|$|It lives {{primarily}} on <b>toothed</b> <b>wrack</b> (Fucus serratus) and bladder wrack (Fucus vesiculosus), {{but is also}} found on the basal part of thongweed (Himanthalia elongata). Numerous individuals {{can be found on}} any one surface.|$|E
50|$|Asterina gibbosa {{is mainly}} nocturnal, {{spending}} the day underneath boulders, overhangs or in caves, or hidden away under algae in rock pools. It is an opportunistic scavenger but {{the bulk of}} its diet comes from the film of bacteria and diatoms that exist on the surface of rocks. It feeds by everting its stomach (turning it inside out) against the surface of the rock and secreting enzymes which digest the film. Other foods found in its stomach included decaying <b>toothed</b> <b>wrack</b> (Fucus serratus), periwinkle faeces and bits of dead molluscs such as mussels (Mytilus edulis), oysters (Ostrea edulis) and periwinkles (Littorina littorea), but 95% of the stomachs contained no large particles indicating the importance in its diet of microscopic organisms.|$|E

The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of Hsp 70 as a biomarker of stress produced by increased temperature, osmotic pressure, and exposure to cadmium and sodium chloride in marine macroalgae and fresh water plant species. An indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IC-ELISA) was developed with a working range of 0. 025 - 10 μg ml- 1 using a monoclonal antibody raised against purified Hsp 70 of Phaseolus aureus (mung bean). Fucus serratus (<b>toothed</b> <b>wrack),</b> Chondrus crispus (Stackhouse or Carrageen moss), Ulva lactuca (sea lettuce) and Lemna minor (common duckweed) sample extracts were stressed for up to 24 h and then tested in the IC-ELISA. The presence of Hsp 70 and cross-reactivity of the monoclonal antibody was confirmed by Western blot. The heat shock response was confirmed in each species using a 2 -h 42 °C treatment. Following heat shock, Hsp 70 concentrations increased to a peak at 2 h (F. serratus) or 4 h (L. minor), after which concentrations decreased. Osmotic and cadmium stresses also resulted in elevated Hsp 70 concentrations in samples of F. serratus and L. minor when compared with unstressed controls. In both, osmotic and metal stress, the production of Hsp 70 increased to a maximum and subsequently decreased as the stressor levels increased. Results suggest that Hsp 70 IC-ELISA could potentially be applied to the detection of stress in these aquatic species, although it would probably be most effective when used in conjunction with other measurements to provide a stressor-specific biomarker profile or fingerprint...|$|E
