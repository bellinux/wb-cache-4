500|$|On July 30, Richard {{went to see}} a {{chiropractor}} who rotated his neck to fix the flow of blood in his upper torso region. Later that day, Richard was participating in warm-ups before the game when he suffered a major stroke and collapsed in the outfield. Before the stroke, he had a headache and a feeling of weakness through his body. Eventually, that progressed into vision problems and paralysis in {{the left side of his}} body. A massive blockage in his right carotid artery necessitated emergency surgery that evening. An examination by neurologist William S. Fields showed that Richard was still experiencing weakness in his extremities and on the left side of his face. He also had blurred vision through his left eye. A CAT scan of Richard's brain later showed that Richard had experienced three separate strokes from the different obstructions in his arterial system. Furthermore, the arteries in his right arm were still obstructed. Later examinations showed that Richard was suffering from extensive arterial thoracic outlet syndrome. While pitching, his clavicle and first rib pinched his subclavian artery. As a result of this problem, Richard would feel normal for the first few innings of the game but after putting repeated pressure on his subclavian artery, his arm would start <b>to</b> <b>ache</b> in pain and eventually start to feel [...] "heavy". His wife at the time, Carolyn, told reporters, [...] "It took death, or nearly death, to get an apology. They should have believed him." ...|$|E

[...] In a uniformly positive review for Time Out New York, Joshua Rothkopf gave Moonlight five stars out of five, praised Barry Jenkins' direction and wrote that the film was [...] "without a doubt, the reason we go to the movies: to understand, to come closer, <b>to</b> <b>ache,</b> hopefully with another." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before the race, Courtney drank a {{glass of}} ice tea that was laced with a drug, {{and was unable to}} race. A little after noon {{on the day of the}} race, Courtney sat down for a meal at a local inn. After the meal, he asked the {{waitress}} for ice tea. The waitress went to make the tea but was stopped by the owner of the inn, who told her he would make the tea humself. Courtney experienced a strange sensation of being too hot, and then, too cold. He went up to his room by himself. Eventually, his throat started to burn and his fingers became numb and cold. He began <b>to</b> <b>ache</b> and soon began to vomit. Riley was informed of the situation and went to visit Courtney. After the visit and consulting with the doctors treating his opponent, Riley decided that Courtney was in no condition to row that day.
