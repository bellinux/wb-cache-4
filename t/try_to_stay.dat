5|$|The storylines {{follow the}} three couples as they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> {{faithful}} to each other. They are {{held back by}} issues such as impotence, infidelity, and unplanned pregnancy. Their lives are further complicated by their jobs, money troubles, and moving in together. Bullen embellished the scripts with events from his own personal life. The directors and producers made additional contributions, {{with the intent to}} keep the fiction in the programme as true to life as possible. The series was filmed in Greater Manchester {{in the first half of}} 1998, using Granada Television's studios, and exterior locations.|$|E
5|$|Over {{half the}} red-backed fairywrens {{in an area}} {{can be found in}} pairs during the mating season. This is {{apparently}} a defence against the resource-limited nature of the environment. It is more difficult to maintain a larger interdependent group during dry spells, so the birds <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in pairs or smaller groups, which include adults that help parents look after young. Paternity tests have shown that an older male with bright plumage has much more success in the mating season and can mate with more than one female. Accordingly, it has higher sperm storage and makes more mating overtures towards females. A male with browner and less bright plumage or a younger male with bright plumage has a much lower success rate than a bright, older male for mating. Further, an unpaired male serves as a helper to a mated pair in feeding and care of young. When the male pairs his bill darkens, and this happens within three weeks. This is much easier to control than plumage, as moulting takes time and is controlled by seasonality. The bill is vascular and much easier to change in response to the pairings.|$|E
5|$|Vettel and Alonso traded fastest laps as {{they pushed}} hard {{in their efforts}} to build up a {{sufficient}} lead over Webber to maintain first and second positions after their pit stops. Massa, Petrov, Buemi and Alguersuari all passed Glock on lap 17 thus eliminating the queue of cars. By lap20, Alonso was leading Vettel by 3.2 seconds; he in turn was a further 11 seconds in front of Hamilton. Button was in fourth, 20 seconds behind Alonso, with Rosberg 3.3 seconds behind the World Champion in fifth. Webber changed his engine settings to give him a higher top speed in an attempt to get past Barrichello and decrease the time gap to Hamilton on lap 22. He avoided colliding with an Armco barrier at the entry of turn eighteen one lap later. Hamilton was told to increase his pace on the 24th lap to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> ahead of Webber after the pit stop phase. But his car had a large amount of oversteer, as his rear, super-soft, compound tyres began to deteriorate, causing his lap times to drop off the leader's pace. Trulli drove to the pit lane and was pushed by his mechanics into the Lotus garage to retire with an hydraulic issue on lap28. Hamilton made the first scheduled stop for tyres on lap29 and re-emerged in eighth position behind Webber. Alonso and Vettel made simultaneous pit stops on the following lap; Alonso retained his lead despite Vettel's pit crew completing their pit stop first; Vettel avoided stalling and drove away in second gear. With newer tyres which provided more grip, Vettel recorded faster lap times than Alonso to close the time gap as the two came across slower cars.|$|E

25|$|While {{atypical}} {{gender role}} development may be heritable, {{this does not}} mean that it is independent. However, environmental effects can differ largely for different genders. Because society is more accepting of male traits (girls playing soccer) than female traits (boys doing ballet), society’s negativity typically forces males to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> within the stereotypic norms. That being said however, male influence accounted by environmental factors that lead to atypical development is also stronger for boys than girls in terms of atypical development.|$|E
25|$|Counter punchers usually {{wear their}} {{opponent}}s down by {{causing them to}} miss their punches. The more the opponent misses, the faster they tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start to sink in. The counter puncher often tries to outplay their opponent entirely, not just in a physical sense, but also in a mental and emotional sense. This style can be incredibly difficult, especially against seasoned fighters, but winning a fight without getting hit is often worth the pay-off. They usually <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> away {{from the center of}} the ring, in order to outmaneuver and chip away at their opponents. A large advantage in counter-hitting is the forward momentum of the attacker, which drives them further into your return strike. As such, knockouts are more common than one would expect from a defensive style.|$|E

25|$|While {{this was}} happening, Hart took {{advantage}} of a momentary lapse in concentration by Austin, who had just finished attacking Diesel, and threw him over the top rope {{on the far side}} of the ring. As Austin got to his feet, he quickly realized that none of the officials had seen his feet touch the floor as they were too busy with breaking the brawl up on the opposite side of the ring. Austin then got back into the ring and continued in the match as if he had not been eliminated, and almost as soon as he did so he pushed both Undertaker and Vader, who were locked in a battle of their own to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in the match, over the top. By this time, Mankind and Funk had been separated and the officials could focus again on the match, just in time to see Hart eliminate Diesel. Just after he did, though, Austin returned the favor from before and dumped Hart out of the ring. As a result, since as far as the officials were concerned Austin was still a legal participant in the match, he was declared the winner of the Royal Rumble.|$|E
25|$|People <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> {{awake and}} eat toshikoshisoba, noodles {{to be eaten}} at midnight. People also visit Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines. Traditionally three are visited. This is called sansha-mairi. In the Imperial Palace at dawn on the 1st, the Emperor {{performs}} the rite of shihōhai (worship of the four-quarters), in which he offers prayers {{for the well-being of}} the nation. On January 2 the public is allowed to enter the inner palace grounds; the only other day this is possible is the Emperor's birthday (December 23). On the 2nd and 3rd days acquaintances visit one another to extend greetings (nenshi) and sip otoso (a spiced rice wine). Some games played at New Year's are karuta (a card game), hanetsuki (similar to badminton), tako age (kiteflying), and komamawashi (spinning tops). These games are played to bring more luck for the year. Exchanging New Year's greeting cards (similar to Christmas Cards) is another important Japanese custom. Also special allowances are given to children, which are called otoshidama. They also decorate their entrances with kagami mochi (two mochi rice balls placed {{one on top of the}} other, with a tangerine on top), and kadomatsu (pine tree decorations).|$|E
25|$|The {{book does}} not limit itself to tedious records of battle because Al-Biruni found the social culture {{to be more}} important. The work {{includes}} research on {{a vast array of}} topics of Indian culture, including descriptions of their traditions and customs. Although he tried to stay away from political and military history, Biruni did indeed record important dates and noted actual sites of where significant battles occurred. Additionally, he chronicled stories of Indian rulers and told of how they ruled over their people with their beneficial actions and acted {{in the interests of the}} nation. But, his details are brief and mostly just list rulers without referring to their real names. He did not go on about deeds that each one carried out during their reign, which keeps in line with Al-Biruni's mission to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> away from political histories. Al-Biruni also described the geography of India in his work. He documented different bodies of water and other natural phenomena. These descriptions are useful to today's modern historians because they are able to use Biruni's scholarship to locate certain destinations in modern-day India. Historians are able to make some matches while also concluding that certain areas seem to have disappeared and been replaced with different cities. Different forts and landmarks were able to be located, legitimizing Al-Biruni's contributions with their usefulness to even modern history and archeology.|$|E

25|$|A maul {{is formed}} when a player {{carrying}} {{the ball is}} held {{by one or more}} opponents, and then {{one or more of the}} ball carrier's teammates bind onto the ball carrier. Players that join the maul must join from behind the hindmost foot of their most hindmost teammate. Players in the maul must <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> on their feet, although the ball carriers may go to ground as long as they make the ball available immediately. Deliberately collapsing, jumping on or dragging players out of the maul is illegal. Players not in the maul or who leave the maul must retire behind the hindmost foot of the player at the back of the maul. The maul successfully ends when the ball or a player carrying the ball leaves the maul, the ball ends up on the ground (becomes a ruck), or the ball is carried over the sideline. If all the players of one team voluntarily leave the maul, the maul continues, with the offside line for the leaving players the front foot of the leading player still in the maul. If the maul stops, it must start again, or the ball must emerge, within five seconds, otherwise it has ended unsuccessfully. It can only restart once; the second time the ball must emerge in five seconds. If the maul collapses and it is not the result of illegal play, it is also an unsuccessful end. All unsuccessful endings result in a scrum being formed, with the defending team putting the ball into the scrum.|$|E

500|$|On 11 August 1963, Evans {{began working}} for the Beatles in the {{combined}} role of roadie/bodyguard. Evans and Aspinall's duties were to drive the van while on tour, and {{to set up and}} test the equipment. Mal's telephone engineering experience was valuable in setting up and maintaining the electrical equipment. The Beatles were being driven back to Liverpool from London by Evans through heavy fog on 21 January 1963, when the windscreen was hit by a pebble and crazed over, so Evans had to break a large hole in it to see the road ahead. This was in winter, so the group had to lie {{one on top of the}} other in the back with a bottle of whisky and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> warm in the freezing temperatures; something McCartney later referred to as a [...] "Beatle sandwich".|$|E
500|$|As Bond girl Giacinta 'Jinx' Johnson in the 2002 {{blockbuster}} Die Another Day, Berry recreated a {{scene from}} Dr. No, emerging from the surf to be greeted by James Bond as Ursula Andress had 40 years earlier. Lindy Hemming, costume designer on Die Another Day, had insisted that Berry wear a bikini and knife as a homage. Berry has said of the scene: [...] "It's splashy", [...] "exciting", [...] "sexy", [...] "provocative" [...] and [...] "it will keep me still out there after winning an Oscar". The bikini scene was shot in Cadiz; the location was reportedly cold and windy, and footage has been released of Berry wrapped in thick towels in between takes to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> warm. According to an ITV news poll, Jinx was voted the fourth toughest girl on screen of all time. Berry was hurt during filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye. It was removed in a 30-minute operation. After Berry won the Academy Award, rewrites were commissioned to give her more screentime for X2.|$|E
