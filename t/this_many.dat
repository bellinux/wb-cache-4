5|$|A {{number of}} subtypes of Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} are recognized. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>many</b> people have overlapping symptoms {{that can make}} the classification difficult in individual cases. All types have partial forms. For instance, some people experience only isolated eye-movement or coordination problems; these {{are thought to be}} a subtype of Miller Fisher syndrome and have similar antiganglioside antibody patterns.|$|E
5|$|Between 80 and 90 {{percent of}} the {{residents}} of New Orleans were evacuated before the hurricane struck, testifying to some {{of the success of the}} evacuation measures. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>many</b> remained in the city, mainly those who did not have access to personal vehicles or who were isolated from the dissemination of news from the local governments. The Louisiana Superdome was used to house and support some of those who were unable to evacuate. Television shots frequently focused on the Superdome as a symbol of the flooding occurring in New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>this,</b> <b>many</b> post-grunge bands {{adopted a}} hard rock sound {{and in the}} 2000s there came a renewed {{interest}} in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and post-punk revival scenes. Out of this movement came garage rock bands like the White Stripes, the Strokes, Interpol and, later on, the Black Keys. In the 2000s, only a few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} years of the show, the staff was forced by the Fox network into doing clip shows to save money. There was {{originally}} intense pressure on the producers of the show to create extra episodes in each season, and the plan was to make four clip shows per season to meet that limit. Writers and producers, however, felt that <b>this</b> <b>many</b> clip shows would alienate fans of the series. The Fox network's reasoning was that clip shows cost half of what a normal episode costs to produce, but they could sell syndication rights at full price.|$|E
5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the moon in the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit {{to make it look}} like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>many</b> of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted moon, as a source for lighting.|$|E
5|$|It {{is crucial}} for these {{definitions}} that edges are only allowed to stay within a single page of the book. As Atneosen already observed, if edges may instead pass from one page to another across {{the spine of the}} book, then every graph may be embedded into a three-page book. For such a three-page topological book embedding in which spine crossings are allowed, every graph can be embedded with at most a logarithmic number of spine crossings per edge, and some graphs need <b>this</b> <b>many</b> spine crossings.|$|E

5|$|Molluscs {{have been}} and still are an {{important}} food source for anatomically modern humans. However {{there is a risk}} of food poisoning from toxins which can accumulate in certain molluscs under specific conditions, and because of <b>this,</b> <b>many</b> countries have regulations to reduce this risk. Molluscs have, for centuries, also been the source of important luxury goods, notably pearls, mother of pearl, Tyrian purple dye, and sea silk. Their shells have also been used as money in some preindustrial societies.|$|E
5|$|The number 1,207 appears {{very early}} in the {{historical}} record (472 BC), and the Greeks appear to have genuinely believed they faced that many ships. Because of the consistency in the ancient sources, some modern historians are inclined to accept 1,207 as the size of the initial Persian fleet; others reject this number, with 1,207 being seen as more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliad, and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean. However, very few appear to accept that there were <b>this</b> <b>many</b> ships at Salamis: most favour a number in the range 600-800. This is also the range given by adding the approximate number of Persian ships after Artemisium (~550) to the reinforcements (120) quantified by Herodotus.|$|E
5|$|The open {{nature of}} the New Forest means that ponies are able to wander onto roads. The ponies {{actually}} have right of way over vehicles and many wear reflective collars {{in an effort to}} reduce traffic fatalities, but despite <b>this,</b> <b>many</b> ponies, along with commoners' cattle, pigs, and donkeys are killed or injured in road traffic accidents every year. Human interaction with ponies is also a problem; well meaning but misguided visitors to the forest frequently feed them, which can create dietary problems and sickness (eg colic) and cause the ponies to adopt an aggressive attitude in order to obtain human food.|$|E

5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{intermarriage}} continued, as many KMT soldiers married aboriginal {{women who were}} from poorer areas and could be easily bought as wives. Modern studies show {{a high degree of}} genetic intermixing. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>many</b> contemporary Taiwanese are unwilling to entertain the idea of having an aboriginal heritage. In a 1994 study, it was found that 71% of the families surveyed would object to their daughter marrying an aboriginal man. For much of the KMT era the government definition of aboriginal identity had been 100% aboriginal parentage, leaving any intermarriage resulting in a non-aboriginal child. Later the policy was adjusted to the ethnic status of the father determining the status of the child.|$|E
5|$|Until 2008, signs at exit43A in {{downtown}} Cumberland labeled the exit as {{providing access to}} WV28 Alt. Because of <b>this,</b> <b>many</b> truckers used this exit to get to WV28. This created problems on WV28 Alt. in Ridgeley, West Virginia, as trucks became stuck under a low railroad overpass, blocking traffic through Ridgeley. To reduce this problem, the Maryland State Highway Administration removed references to WV28 Alt. from guide signs for exit43A and placed warning signs in Cumberland and on I-68 approaching Cumberland advising truckers to instead use exit43B to MD51, which allows them to connect to WV28 via Virginia Avenue, bypassing the low overpass in Ridgeley.|$|E

In an interview with Rockin' On Japan in 2011, Yamaguchi felt that the people who became fans during this period became Sakaction's core fanbase. Because of <b>this,</b> <b>many</b> of Sakanaction's concert set-lists continue to feature songs from Kikuuiki for these people.|$|E

5|$|Around {{midnight on}} Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona pulled {{up near the}} side {{entrance}} of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road. Two men with fake police uniforms waited {{for at least an}} hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a St. Patrick's Day party nearby. Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other security guard. The two guards were the only people in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done <b>this</b> <b>many</b> times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.|$|E
5|$|Following Jardine's {{appointment}} as England captain in July 1932, {{he developed a}} plan based on his belief that Bradman was weak against bowling directed at leg stump and that if this line of attack could be maintained, it would restrict Bradman's scoring {{to one side of}} the field, giving the bowlers greater control of his scoring. In a meeting, he outlined his plan to Larwood and Voce, who tried out the tactic in the remainder of the season with mixed success. Both Nottinghamshire fast bowlers were selected to tour, as was Yorkshire bowler Bill Bowes who had tried similar tactics at the end of the season. In one match, he bowled short at Jack Hobbs; in his capacity as cricket correspondent of The Morning Post, Warner was highly critical of the Yorkshire bowlers and Bowes in particular. These remarks were seized upon by Australian opponents of Bodyline in the coming months. A fourth fast bowler, Middlesex amateur Gubby Allen, was later added to the tour. The selection of <b>this</b> <b>many</b> pace bowlers was unusual at the time, drawing comment from Australian writers, including Bradman.|$|E
5|$|In 1782, William Hornby {{assumed the}} office of Governor of Bombay, and {{initiated}} the Hornby Vellard engineering project of uniting the seven islands into a single landmass. The purpose of this project was to block the Worli creek and prevent the low-lying areas of Bombay from being flooded at high tide. However, the project {{was rejected by the}} British East India Company in 1783. In 1784, the Hornby Vellard project was completed and soon reclamations at Worli and Mahalaxmi followed. The history of journalism in Bombay commenced with publication of the Bombay Herald in 1789 and the Bombay Courier in 1790. In 1795, the Maratha army defeated the Nizam of Hyderabad. Following <b>this,</b> <b>many</b> artisans and construction workers from Andhra Pradesh migrated to Bombay and settled into the flats which were constructed by the Hornby Vellard. These workers where called Kamathis, and their enclave was called Kamathipura. The construction of the Sion Causeway (Duncan Causeway) commenced in 1798. The construction of the Sion Causeway was completed in 1802 by Governor Jonathan Duncan. It connected Bombay Island to Kurla in Salsette. On 17 February 1803, a fire raged through the town, razing many localities around the Old Fort, subsequently the British had to plan a new town with wider roads. In May 1804, Bombay was hit by a severe famine, which led to a large-scale emigration. On 5 November 1817, the British East India Company under Mountstuart Elphinstone defeated Bajirao II, the Peshwa of the Maratha Empire, in the Battle of Kirkee which took place on the Deccan Plateau. The success of the British campaign in the Deccan witnessed the freedom of Bombay from all attacks by native powers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the story}} group, monsters {{were the first}} thing designed. The monsters' names, skills, and personalities were decided first, after which they were drawn by artist Akira Toriyama. Yuji Horii allowed Toriyama to paint full {{drawings}} rather than directly create the pixel art that would be shown in the game. The artwork was then converted into computer graphics; as Toriyama was unfamiliar with computer graphics technology, other staff took charge of <b>this.</b> <b>Many</b> new monsters needed to be designed to make the game feel real, and the process was laborious for Toriyama. But he has also said that, compared to the manga comics he was used to, he enjoyed painting more, so on balance the experience was positive. Yuji Horii stated that for his process, like other manga and film creators, he quickly outlines the story's plot in his mind. With regard to map design, a blank map was used to create the physical shape of the place, like a castle, cave, or tower, and then the key elements and story were created together afterwards. The scenarios were mainly written by his friend Hiroshi Miyaoka. Compared with write lines in writing paper and design map in graph paper, staff wrote both two in 5mm graph papers of A4, as they felt that's easy for organization; their manuscript thickness is 15cm.|$|E
5|$|York {{made their}} seventh {{re-election}} bid after 1980–81, before the club won its {{first and only}} league title after finishing first in the Fourth Division in 1983–84 with 101 points. They were {{the first team to}} score <b>this</b> <b>many</b> points in a Football League season. After four seasons in the Third Division, York were relegated in 1987–88, statistically the club's worst Football League season. They beat Crewe Alexandra on penalties at Wembley Stadium in the play-off final in 1992–93, winning promotion back to the third tier of English football, now renamed as the Second Division. The following season, York competed in the play-off semi-final, when they were beaten by Stockport County. Later in the 1990s, they knocked Premier League teams Manchester United and Everton out of the League Cup in successive seasons. After six seasons, York were relegated to the Third Division in 1998–99. In the following years, the club experienced financial troubles; chairman Douglas Craig offered the club and its ground for sale in December 2001.|$|E
