5|$|The {{player is}} {{supposed}} to find five Tarot cards in the game in order to solve a crucial puzzle. Each card <b>triggers</b> <b>a</b> cut-scene. When collected, they are arranged in a nine-pane grid to solve the puzzle. The difficulty level determines what clues are given and what order the cards need to be laid out.|$|E
5|$|After {{advancing}} to the Imperial Age, players can also construct a Wonder, an extremely expensive non-military building. On many gameplay modes, building a Wonder <b>triggers</b> <b>a</b> victory countdown—unless it's destroyed within a certain timeframe, the building player wins. Every civilization's Wonder is {{in the shape of}} a landmark unique to that historical culture—the Temple of Heaven for the Chinese, for example, or Notre Dame for the Franks.|$|E
30|$|Tick is a {{function}} that describes the conditions that <b>trigger</b> <b>a</b> possible Report. SECRET identifies the following alternative Tick strategies: (1) tuple-driven: each incoming element <b>triggers</b> <b>an</b> evaluation; (2) time-driven: each time progress <b>triggers</b> <b>an</b> evaluation.|$|R

5|$|Bond {{chooses not}} to take Smythe into custody immediately, but leaves him to {{contemplate}} his options – suicide or a court martial. As Smythe hunts for scorpion fish to feed Octopussy, he suffers a sting which <b>triggers</b> <b>a</b> fatal heart attack, during which Octopussy pulls him under. Deciding to spare Smythe's reputation, Bond classifies the death as an accidental drowning.|$|E
5|$|The close {{relationship}} between the katipo and redback is shown when mating, The male redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo can not mate with the female redback as the male katipo is heavier than the male redback and when it approaches the web it <b>triggers</b> <b>a</b> predatory response in the female leading to the katipo being eaten before mating occurs. There is evidence of interbreeding between katipo and redbacks in the wild.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the genus Latrodectus in the family Theridiidae, the redback belongs in a clade with the black widow spider, with the katipo as its closest relative. A 2004 {{molecular}} study supports the redback's status as a distinct species, as does the unique abdomen-presenting behaviour of the male during mating. The close {{relationship between the two}} species is shown when mating: the male redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo is too heavy to mate with the female redback, as it <b>triggers</b> <b>a</b> predatory response in the female when it approaches the web, causing the female to eat it. There is evidence of interbreeding between female katipo and male redbacks in the wild.|$|E
50|$|Diphenylcyclopropenone acts as <b>a</b> local irritant, <b>triggering</b> <b>a</b> local sensitization. It <b>triggers</b> <b>an</b> immune {{response}} that opposes {{the action of}} the autoreactive cells that otherwise cause hair loss.|$|R
30|$|Click <b>trigger</b> To <b>trigger</b> <b>a</b> mouse down event, users lift {{one finger}} from the touch surface. From a mouse down event, to <b>trigger</b> <b>a</b> mouse up event, users replace the lifted {{finger on the}} touch surface, {{completing}} a click event. Although this click method may seem counterintuitive, since most users are accustomed to pressing <b>a</b> button to <b>trigger</b> <b>a</b> click, the lift-and-place concept is well suited to replace drag-and-drop.|$|R
50|$|The {{agreement}} <b>triggered</b> <b>an</b> {{assassination attempt}} on King, orchestrated {{by the local}} Ku Klux Klan. The bombing at King's hotel room <b>triggered</b> <b>a</b> civil disturbance in Birmingham which brought in the police forces and then the National Guard.|$|R
5|$|Between {{the events}} of the first game and Halo 2, the Chief and a few other {{survivors}} return to Earth, warning of an impending Covenant attack; this attack forms the first mission of the game. Meanwhile, the Covenant, unaware of the destructive nature of the rings, attempt to fire another ring, Installation 05, to fulfill their religious prophecy and to do so launch an attack on Earth. Helping the Chief to defend the Earth are Sergeant Avery Johnson and Commander Miranda Keyes. One race in the Covenant, the Elites, learn the truth about the rings and are led by a former Elite commander named the Arbiter (also a player character) to join forces with humanity to stop the firing of the ring. Though they are successful, the unexpected shutdown of the installation <b>triggers</b> <b>a</b> fail-safe protocol, priming all the rings for firing from the Ark.|$|E
5|$|Food {{is mostly}} {{selected}} by sight, even in conditions of dim light. Movement of the prey <b>triggers</b> <b>a</b> feeding response. Frogs {{have been caught}} on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs (Rana clamitans) have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past. Toads, salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey. This response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves. Cave-dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell. Some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell, even in complete darkness.|$|E
5|$|In humans, this {{response}} is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on {{the surfaces of}} microbes. This recognition signal <b>triggers</b> <b>a</b> rapid killing response. The speed of the response {{is a result of}} signal amplification that occurs after sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.|$|E

50|$|Sprytrons can be also <b>triggered</b> by <b>a</b> laser pulse. In 1999 {{the laser}} pulse energy needed to <b>trigger</b> <b>a</b> sprytron {{was reduced to}} 10 microjoules.|$|R
5000|$|Overload sensor — {{prevents}} the elevator from moving until excess load has been removed. It may <b>trigger</b> <b>a</b> voice prompt or buzzer alarm.

5|$|In {{the solitary}} phase, these {{grasshoppers}} are innocuous, {{their numbers are}} low, {{and they do not}} pose a major economic threat to agriculture. However, under suitable conditions of drought followed by rapid vegetation growth, serotonin in their brains <b>triggers</b> <b>a</b> dramatic set of changes: they start to breed abundantly, becoming gregarious and nomadic (loosely described as migratory) when their populations become dense enough. They form bands of wingless nymphs which later become swarms of winged adults. Both the bands and the swarms move around and rapidly strip fields and cause damage to crops. The adults are powerful fliers; they can travel great distances, consuming most of the green vegetation wherever the swarm settles.|$|E
5|$|The second type, {{triggered}} by entering giant rings found in secret passages, involves running around a 3D map and passing {{through all of}} a number of blue spheres arranged in patterns. Passing through a blue sphere turns it red, and touching a red sphere causes the player to leave the stage, unless the player has just completed a cycle around an arrangement of blue spheres, in which case all of these spheres turn to harmless rings. Removing all of the blue spheres gives the player a Chaos Emerald; if Sonic (not Tails) collects all seven, he can become Super Sonic at will, which makes him invincible to most obstacles. Failing to collect the seven Chaos Emeralds <b>triggers</b> <b>a</b> post-credits scene in which Robotnik and Knuckles taunt the player.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{may affect}} {{specific}} sounds or the entire phonological system. Sound change can consist of {{the replacement of}} one speech sound or phonetic feature by another, {{the complete loss of}} the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be conditioned in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be regular, which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be sporadic, affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change <b>triggers</b> <b>a</b> chain shift in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the Germanic languages when the sound change known as Grimm's law affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant * became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous * in turn became /p/, and the previous * became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why Italic languages such as Latin have p in words like pater and pisces, whereas Germanic languages, like English, have father and fish.|$|E
50|$|Krytrons and sprytrons are <b>triggered</b> by <b>a</b> {{high voltage}} from a {{capacitor}} discharge via <b>a</b> <b>trigger</b> transformer, in <b>a</b> similar way flashtubes for e.g. photoflash applications are <b>triggered.</b> Devices integrating <b>a</b> krytron with <b>a</b> <b>trigger</b> transformer are available.|$|R
5000|$|Gate (sometimes called [...] "trigger") {{indicates}} when a note should start, a pulse {{that is used}} to <b>trigger</b> <b>an</b> event, typically an ADSR envelope. In {{the case}} of <b>triggering</b> <b>a</b> drum machine, a clock signal or LFO square wave could be employed to signal the next beat.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>trigger</b> is <b>an</b> event {{coming from}} an ASP.NET control that causes an UpdatePanel to refresh its contents. Through <b>triggers,</b> <b>an</b> {{asynchronous}} postback can be started also by controls that are declared outside {{the region of}} the ASP.NET page wrapped by the UpdatePanel control.|$|R
5|$|Ellen Louise Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is {{the primary}} protagonist of the main Alien series. The mother of Amanda Ripley and a warrant officer on the Nostromo, she and the cat Jones are the sole {{survivors}} of the expedition. After putting herself and the cat in cryosleep, she is rescued fifty-seven years later and relieved of duty by Weyland-Yutani {{for the destruction of}} the Nostromo and her outlandish claims about the Alien. After communication is lost with LV-426, Ripley is sent with a unit of colonial marines on the Sulaco to investigate; the entire expedition, except Ripley, Corporal Hicks, the orphan Newt and the android Bishop, is lost. In cryosleep on the Sulaco, Ripley is impregnated with a queen by a facehugger Alien morph; this <b>triggers</b> <b>a</b> fire, which causes the ship to crash on the prison planet Fiorina 161, killing all aboard, save for Ripley. As the sole human survivor of the crash, Ripley helps the prisoners incarcerated on the planet to defeat an Alien created from an animal impregnated by a second facehugger. Weyland-Yutani arrives to claim the queen incubating in Ripley, prompting her to sacrifice herself by diving into the furnace.|$|E
5|$|Tales of Vesperia is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{set in a}} fantasy world featuring three-dimensional environments and characters. The game's environments are split into two types. On the field map, the main characters navigate reduced-scale environments. A compass and mini-map are displayed, along with towns, other named locations, and enemy icons. Striking an enemy icon <b>triggers</b> <b>a</b> battle, while interacting with a town causes the party to enter it. In battle and towns or similar locations, characters move around environments built on a lifelike scale relative to the human characters. In these areas, the party may interact with non-player characters (NPCs). Within these environments, items such as crates came be moved by the currently-assigned character. After {{a certain point in}} the game, an item called the Sorcerer's Ring is given to the party, enabling them to shoot bolts of energy. These bolts can be used to activate switches, move objects, and attack enemies from a distance. Save points can be found in dungeons and towns. Items such as equipment and weapons are purchased with Gald, the in-game currency. While in environments, players can trigger optional character conversations called Skits. In Skits, characters are represented by head-and-shoulder portraits, and the conversations can range from dramatic to comedic.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoral}} glans doubles {{in diameter}} upon arousal, and, upon further stimulation, it becomes less visible {{as it is}} covered by the swelling of tissues of the clitoral hood. The swelling protects the glans from direct contact, as direct contact at this stage can be more irritating than pleasurable. Vasocongestion eventually <b>triggers</b> <b>a</b> muscular reflex, which expels the blood that was trapped in surrounding tissues, and leads to an orgasm. A short time after stimulation has stopped, especially if orgasm has been achieved, the glans becomes visible again and returns to its normal state, with a few seconds (usually 5–10) to return to its normal position and 5–10 minutes to return to its original size. If orgasm is not achieved, the clitoris may remain engorged for a few hours, which women often find uncomfortable. Additionally, the clitoris is very sensitive after orgasm, making further stimulation initially painful for some women. Masters and Johnson documented the sexual response cycle, which has four phases and is still the clinically accepted definition of the human orgasm.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} movie {{opens with}} the protagonist, Keil Fluge (unnamed in the North American version), hunting in a canyon. After seeing an Imperial flying battleship in the sky, he is attacked by two creatures and chases {{one of them}} to a large, ancient complex built directly into the rock. He explores the ruin, and sees relics of old technology still hanging from the ceilings. Another gigantic creature suddenly attacks him, and though his weapon is useless against the armored creature, a rumbling <b>triggers</b> <b>a</b> cave in, which crushes the monster and saves Keil. From the newly created hole, an armored, blue dragon flies down the cavern with a rider across its shoulders, being chased by an even bigger black dragon as the cavern is destroyed in an explosion. Regaining consciousness outside, Keil sees the two dragons locked in combat in the air before him. Dodging a blast from the black dragon, the blue dragon's rider is then hit by single shot to the chest, and the black dragon flies away. The blue dragon flies towards Keil. A psychic connection is made between the rider and Keil, who is told not to let the black dragon reach the black tower. The rider then dies and Keil picks up his fallen gun, climbs atop the dragon and flies away, determined to finish the rider's quest.|$|E
