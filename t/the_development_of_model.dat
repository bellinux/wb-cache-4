[...] In 1933, he published (in Polish) The concept of truth in formalized languages, in which he proposed his semantic theory of truth: a sentence such as [...] "snow is white" [...] is true if and only if snow is white. [...] Tarski's theory separated the metalanguage, which makes the statement about truth, from the object language, which contains the sentence whose truth is being asserted, and gave a correspondence (the T-schema) between phrases in the object language and elements of an interpretation. [...] Tarski's approach to the difficult idea of explaining truth has been enduringly influential in logic and philosophy, especially in <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>model</b> theory.
