5|$|The Naval Academy {{would not}} produce another {{football}} team until the 1882 season. The 1882 {{team would be}} the first with a coach, being supported by Academy officials. The 1879 season was the last time that a Navy squad would play the Baltimore Athletic Club. Navy would finish the 1880s with four winning seasons, and an overall record of 14–12–2, with one of those ties being the game against the Baltimore Athletic Club. Navy would outscore their opponents 292–231, and would finish the 19th century with an overall record of 54–19–3. The lack of a coach for the 1879 season was one of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>times</b> the Naval Academy squad lacked one, the other time being from 1883 through 1891.|$|E
5|$|Specter {{died from}} {{complications}} of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, aged 82, on October 14, 2012, {{at his home}} in Philadelphia. Statements of condolence were issued by President and Mrs. Obama, Vice President and Mrs. Biden, the Office of the Governor of Pennsylvania, and by many of his colleagues and former opponents in the U.S. Congress, the Pennsylvania legislature, and the city of Philadelphia, among many others. Senator Specter, while he had been accused of alienating both parties due to certain positions he took and due to <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>times</b> he switched parties, among other issues, was nonetheless respected by many as a principled statesman who did much for his state and country, including by those in politics and the legislature, both in Pennsylvania and his home state, Kansas, as well as across the U.S. and beyond. He was the longest-serving of Pennsylvania's U.S. Senators, and it was said that he had done more for the state than anyone else, {{with the possible exception of}} Benjamin Franklin himself. As a sign of this respect and out of mourning, President Obama ordered U.S. flags to be lowered to half-staff at public institutions and military bases in Washington, D.C. and the rest of the country on his day of interment.|$|E

2500|$|In 1977, Schorr {{was hired}} by Reese Schonfeld as a White House {{correspondent}} for ITNA (Independent Television News Association), a news agency serving independent television news stations in the U.S. In 1979, Schonfeld and Ted Turner brought Schorr to Cable News Network (CNN), {{where he was the}} first on-camera employee hired. He reported news and delivered commentary and news analysis on the fledgling CNN. His contract was not renewed in 1985, one of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>times</b> he stated he was [...] "fired". He then took the position as Senior News Analyst at NPR, a position he held for decades up to the time of his death. In that position, he regularly commented on current events for programs including All Things Considered and Weekend Edition.

2500|$|For {{the special}} cases of solar and lunar eclipses, these only happen during an [...] "eclipse season", <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>times</b> {{of each year}} when {{the plane of the}} Earth's orbit around the Sun crosses with the plane of the Moon's orbit around the Earth. The type of solar eclipse that happens during each season (whether total, annular, hybrid, or partial) depends on {{apparent}} sizes of the Sun and Moon. If the orbit of the Earth around the Sun, and the Moon's orbit around the Earth were both in the same plane with each other, then eclipses would happen each and every month. There would be a lunar eclipse at every full moon, and a solar eclipse at every new moon. And if both orbits were perfectly circular, then each solar eclipse would be the same type every month. It is because of the non-planar and non-circular differences that eclipses are not a common event. Lunar eclipses can be viewed from the entire nightside half of the Earth. But solar eclipses, particularly a total eclipse, as occurring at any one particular point on the Earth's surface, is a rare event that can span many decades from one to the next.|$|E

2500|$|David Lewis {{was seen}} as the front runner by the media. He had worked for either the NDP and its forerunner, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, for almost 36 years. He was the National Secretary from 1936 until 1950, when he moved from Ottawa to Toronto to set up a labour law practice. He served as the National President of the CCF during its final years, {{and was one of the}} main {{organizers}} behind bringing labour and democratic socialists together to form the NDP in 1961. He had been the Member of Parliament for the federal electoral district of York South, since 1962 (with the exception of a two-year period between 1963 and 1965). <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>times</b> that T.C. Douglas did not win a seat to parliament, Lewis took over as house leader. The second time, in 1968, essentially left Lewis as the de facto leader. His years of service and control of most of the federal party's apparatus made him the [...] "Establishment" [...] candidate, and the one to beat at the convention. During the leadership campaign, he did not travel around the country, as the other candidates had to, since he did most of his electioneering in the fall of 1970, and declared his intentions formally in December 1970, as a direct result of this work.|$|E
2500|$|The club's {{good form}} {{continued}} in their next away match against Triglav as they achieved their fourth straight 2011–12 victory (2–0) and topped the league {{table for the}} first time of the season. During the next round their run was stopped with a goalless home draw against <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>times</b> champions, Domžale. In the week that followed Maribor played another home match, this time against their rivals Mura 05. The team proved to be too strong against the visiting side, a team that played in the second division during the previous season, and comfortably won the match with the score 6–0. Dalibor Volaš, Etien Velikonja and Agim Ibraimi each scored two goals. Days later club legend Ante Šimundža left the club and became the head coach of Mura 05. Saša Gajser replaced Šimundža as an assistant coach at Maribor. Immediately after their victory over Mura 05 the team traveled to Edinburgh where they faced Scottish champions Rangers in the second leg of the UEFA Europa League play-offs. The match in Scotland ended with a score 1–1 and Maribor proceeded to the next round with the score 3–2 on aggregate, thus becoming the first Slovenian club that qualified to the group stages of the Europa League. They were on the road again less than 72 hours after the historic night when they faced their [...] "eternal" [...] rivals Olimpija, the team considered as Maribor's main contender for the 2011–12 title, at the Stožice Stadium in Ljubljana. Unrecognizable during the first half Maribor went down by three goals at halftime and was unable to turn the result back in their favour. Eventually they lost the game 4–1 and sustained their first league defeat of the season. In addition, this was the first loss for Maribor after 17 consecutive league rounds without defeat (2 April 2011 vs Koper).|$|E
