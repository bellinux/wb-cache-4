Going online allowed professors to target <b>their</b> <b>classes</b> to specific audiences, such as Latino school teachers or museum professionals in certain regions, and by 2008 more than 25% {{of the online}} courses were Harvard College classes.|$|E
5|$|Nowadays, the National Curriculum Guidelines have {{provisions}} for those learning Icelandic whose mother tongue is {{a foreign language}} and deaf and hearing-impaired pupils. Pupils are expected {{to keep up with}} the pace of teaching; however those students who are struggling receive remedial teaching without being moved from most of <b>their</b> <b>classes.</b> An emphasis is made on providing a variety of teaching methods.|$|E
5|$|Each {{class is}} managed {{by one of}} eleven {{academic}} departments. Nine departments will be experienced by students {{before the end of}} their senior year, as one or more of <b>their</b> <b>classes</b> are mandatory for graduation. The other two departments are specialized courses; one involves the Culinary Arts, while the other involves a precollegiate form of ROTC. This system of Professional Learning Communities was designed by Illinois's former Adlai E. Stevenson High School principal, Richard Du Four.|$|E

5|$|Each {{class of}} cadets elects representatives {{to serve as}} class {{president}} and fill several administrative positions. They also elect a ring and crest committee, which designs the class's crest, the emblem that signifies <b>their</b> <b>class</b> and it is embossed upon <b>their</b> <b>class</b> rings. Each class crest is required to contain the initials USMA and <b>their</b> <b>class</b> motto. The class motto is proposed by the class during cadet basic training and voted on by the class prior {{to the beginning of}} their freshman academic year. Class mottos typically have verbiage that rhymes or is phonetically similar with <b>their</b> <b>class</b> year.|$|R
5000|$|All classes except peasant {{may either}} rededicate <b>their</b> <b>class</b> or become {{a master of}} <b>their</b> <b>class</b> once they reach level ninety nine in <b>their</b> <b>class.</b> If the {{character}} wishes to Master <b>their</b> <b>class,</b> they must obtain specific items used to the [...] "Mastering" [...] process. Rededicating <b>their</b> <b>class</b> means they choose {{to become one of}} the other four common <b>classes,</b> losing all <b>their</b> levels and becoming unable to use <b>their</b> old <b>class’s</b> weapons and armor, but keeping the abilities learned in the previous class. The correct term for this is Rededication, however this is commonly referred to by players colloquially as [...] "subbing." [...] Once a character has reached level ninety nine in <b>their</b> <b>class</b> or <b>their</b> new <b>class,</b> they may Master. Mastering grants the ability to raise your stats to the maximum level of <b>their</b> respective <b>class,</b> as well as a specialized weapon and armor. Masters also learn some new class specific skills/spells. Those with only one class, called Pures in the game, gain additional skills or spells which rededicated subs do not receive. Although in the past the pure-only skills were very weak (and even further in the past there were no benefits to staying pure at all,) today the pure-only skills are extremely potent and are finally worth the enormous sacrifice of every pre-99 ability of another class.|$|R

5|$|Simultaneously, work progressed on the Mosholu Parkway Extension, and Mosholu Avenue {{within the}} park was being {{modified}} {{so that it would}} be bisected by Henry Hudson Parkway. A bridge was constructed over the railroad in 1940, and a road linking the avenue and the new Mosholu Parkway was opened the next year. Mosholu Parkway was then extended to the Henry Hudson Parkway via a partial cloverleaf interchange built near the park's sole freshwater marsh. When biology teachers who used the marsh for <b>their</b> <b>classes</b> raised concerns about construction, an assistant to Moses said that the marsh would get a landscaping so that it looked like a series of lagoons surrounded by shrubbery.|$|E

Later, Leslie and Justin Anderson (Justin Theroux), who have been dating for weeks, have another excellent date in Indianapolis. At the end of the night, they decide their next date will be in Pawnee, and Leslie feels pressure to make their date equally exciting. While talking later with Ann (Rashida Jones), Leslie decides to host a dinner party at her home with all her interesting friends. She invites Mark (Paul Schneider), Tom (Aziz Ansari) and Ron (Nick Offerman), specifically excludes Jerry (Jim O'Heir), and asks Andy (Chris Pratt) to work as the waiter. Andy agrees, even though he hates Justin, Ann's former crush, and Mark, her current boyfriend.|$|E

5|$|Placed on {{an upper}} {{floor of the}} State House, the bell was rung {{in the early years}} of {{independence}} on the Fourth of July and on Washington's Birthday, as well as on Election Day to remind voters to hand in their ballots. It also rang to call students at the University of Pennsylvania to <b>their</b> <b>classes</b> at nearby Philosophical Hall. Until 1799, when the state capital was moved to Lancaster, it again rang to summon legislators into session. When Pennsylvania, having no further use for its State House, proposed to tear it down and sell the land for building lots, the City of Philadelphia purchased the land, together with the building, including the bell, for $70,000, equal to $ today. In 1828, the city sold the second Lester and Pack bell to St. Augustine's Roman Catholic Church, which was burned down by an anti-Catholic mob in the Philadelphia Nativist Riots of 1844. The remains of the bell were recast; the new bell is now located at Villanova University.|$|E
5|$|Students in Malawi have {{expressed}} {{high levels of}} dissatisfaction regarding the HIV/AIDS-related education and support they receive at school. According to a survey of students in Malawi, most secondary students {{do not believe that}} the HIV/AIDS curricula at their schools provide them with an adequate understanding of the disease. Although the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations have conducted many campaigns to improve awareness about HIV/AIDS in schools, there is still a significant shortage of age-appropriate audio and visual educational materials relating to HIV/AIDS available to instructors, particularly in rural areas. In addition, most teachers cannot identify the students in <b>their</b> <b>classes</b> who have been personally affected by the epidemic, either through friends or relatives, which suggests that school-based support for HIV/AIDS is minimal. However, despite this lack of support, surveys indicate that children who have been affected by the epidemic do not usually experience HIV/AIDS-based discrimination at school.|$|E
