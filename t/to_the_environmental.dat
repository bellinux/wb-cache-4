5|$|The {{environmental}} impact of wind power when compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> impacts of fossil fuels, is relatively minor.

5|$|Humans {{arrived in}} the Florida {{peninsula}} approximately 15,000years ago. Paleo-Indians came to Florida probably following large game that included giant sloths, saber-toothed cats, and spectacled bears. They found an arid landscape that supported plants and animals adapted for desert conditions. However, 6,500years ago, climate changes brought a wetter landscape; large animals became extinct in Florida, and the Paleo-Indians slowly adapted and became the Archaic peoples. They conformed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> changes, and created many tools with the various resources available. During the Late Archaic period, the climate became wetter again, and approximately 3000 BCE the rise of water tables allowed an increase in population and cultural activity. Florida Indians developed into three distinct but similar cultures that were named for the bodies of water near where they were located: Okeechobee, Caloosahatchee, and Glades.|$|E
5|$|Oil sands in Alberta have {{a proven}} reserve of , {{the second largest}} proven {{reserves}} of crude oil in the world. They have become the largest source of oil imported into the United States. With significant economic development and investment into the oil sands, the industry has been enjoying strong support by both the province's government and the federal government. However, the industry has also been subject to criticism due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> impacts of bitumen exploitation. While the industry has attempted to resolve these issues by developing new techniques, such as in situ extraction, environmental organizations, such as Greenpeace, have launched campaigns to delegitimize the resource, based on its greenhouse gas emission records.|$|E
5|$|The 50-kilometre Cross Island Line will {{span the}} island of Singapore, passing through Tuas, Jurong, Sin Ming, Ang Mo Kio, Hougang, Punggol, Pasir Ris and Changi. The {{addition}} of the new line brings commuters with another alternative for East-West travel to the current East West Line, and will {{play an important role}} in Singapore's rail network. It will connect to all the other major lines to serve as a key transfer line, complementing the role currently fulfilled by the orbital Circle Line. This line will even have a longer timeframe due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> study aspects, with the completion by 2030. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has also expressed interest in the implementation of possible express services on the CRL in future, apart from having just normal services. This express service would benefit commuters during the morning peak hours as trains would stop at only the interchanges and skip the remaining stations, hence, reducing travel time greatly.|$|E

5|$|The Negative Declaration for the {{expansion}} of US 113 from {{the north end of the}} Frederica bypass to US 113 Alternate at Little Heaven was issued in 1975, and construction began that same year. The FredericaLittle Heaven divided highway was completed in 1977. Design work for the divided highway from Little Heaven to Dover Air Force Base began as early as 1964, and considerable planning and design work was done before that work came to a halt in the 1970s. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> effects of the highway crossing a large marsh, which required DelDOT to produce a draft environmental impact statement, DelDOT needed to coordinate with the U.S. Coast Guard to construct a new bridge across the St. Jones River. US 113 was finally expanded to a divided highway, including a four-lane bridge across the St. Jones River, by 1985. The final stretch of two-lane US 113 in Delaware was eliminated when the second carriageway was added to the highway from Bedford Street in Georgetown to north of Lincoln in 1995 and 1996. This expansion, in particular a section near Ellendale, was included in a Federal Highway Administration pavement study.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{existing}} airport infrastructure to meet forecast demand is limited, and government policy published in 2003 supports the development of additional airport capacity by 2030 to address this. The strategy is generally based on making {{the best use of}} existing facilities, although an additional five new runways nationwide are considered to be necessary, three of them at the London airports of Stansted, Heathrow and, {{towards the end of the}} timeframe involved, Gatwick. This policy is designed to be a balanced and measured approach to the future of the air transport industry; one that recognises both an economic advantage in providing for growth in demand for air travel and also the need to address the consequent environmental impacts. The strategy has been criticised by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee, by environmentalist and campaign groups, and in research papers, for implementing a predict and provide model that overstates the economic advantages whilst paying insufficient heed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> consequences.|$|E
5|$|The {{holes in}} the cuticle which allow for this {{digestive}} mechanism pose a challenge for the plant, since they serve as breaks in the cuticle (waxy layer) that protects the plant from desiccation. As a result, P. moranensis is usually found in relatively humid environments. The production of the stalked capture glands and sessile digestive glands is also costly. A {{recent study found that}} the density of these respective glands can be correlated to environmental gradients. For example, capture gland density was found to be highest where prey availability was low, whereas digestive glands density showed direct correlation to prey availability. These results suggest that the amount of investment in carnivorous features is an adaptation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> gradients.|$|E

5|$|The {{underlying}} {{driver of}} direct human {{impacts on the}} environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption {{of goods and services}} can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental,</b> social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), resource intensity, and resource productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are food, energy, materials and water.|$|E
