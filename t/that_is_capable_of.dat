25|$|Evidence {{indicates}} that beach vitex possesses a combinational dormancy mechanism. This dormancy mechanism {{is made up}} of a physical dormancy component and a physiological dormancy component. The physical dormancy mechanism is believed to be inforced at least in part by cuticular alkanes that prevent water penetration. The mechanism of the physiological dormancy component is not yet fully understood. This dormancy mechanism allows {{for the establishment of a}} substantial soil seed bank <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> surviving and producing new seedlings in excess of 4 years after all vegetation has been removed. Dormancy mechanisms also allow the plant to undergo long-distance dispersal.|$|E
