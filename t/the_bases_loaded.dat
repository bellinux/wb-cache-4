5|$|In {{the fifth}} and {{deciding}} game of the 1984 World Series against the San Diego Padres, Kuntz pinch-hit for designated hitter Johnny Grubb with <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded</b> and the score tied at three. Kuntz hit a pop-up to short right field that Tony Gwynn was unable to see. Second baseman Alan Wiggins made the catch, {{but was unable to}} prevent Kirk Gibson from racing home from third with the go-ahead run. The Tigers maintained their lead after that, giving Kuntz an unlikely game-winning RBI.|$|E
5|$|In {{the top of}} the eighth, Mueller led {{off with}} a single to right and Nixon {{followed}} with his third double of the game. Jason Isringhausen came in to pitch for the Cardinals with <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded</b> and nobody out, and was able the finish the inning without allowing a run to score. Kevin Millar pinch hit for the Red Sox starting pitcher Lowe during this inning. It was the third straight game in which the Red Sox starting pitcher had not allowed an earned run.|$|E
5|$|Now {{trailing}} by five runs, the Angels threatened {{again in}} the eighth inning with runners on second and third, but Hudler grounded out to end the threat. In the bottom of the eighth, the Mariners again had <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded</b> when Tino Martinez singled to score Edgar Martínez, followed by a Dan Wilson double that scored Jay Buhner and Blowers, and finally a sacrifice fly double play hit by Cora that scored Tino Martinez but got Wilson thrown out at third. Tony Phillips led off the ninth for the Angels with a home run to avoid a shutout, but Johnson retired the next three Angels hitters to record his sixth complete game and 18th win of the season.|$|E
50|$|While {{historically}} large {{power grids}} have had <b>base</b> <b>load</b> power plant to exclusively meet <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>load,</b> {{there is no}} specific technical requirement {{for this to be}} so. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>load</b> can equally well be met by the appropriate quantity of intermittent power sources and peaking power plant.|$|R
50|$|Each {{baseload}} power plant on a grid is allotted a specific {{amount of the}} {{baseload power}} demand to handle. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>load</b> power {{is determined by the}} load duration curve of the system. For a typical power system, the rule of thumb is that <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>load</b> power is usually 35-40% of the maximum load during the year.|$|R

5|$|On August 9 {{against the}} Kansas City Royals, Molina {{came in with}} two outs and <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded.</b> After drawing a 1–0 count against Peter Moylan, a brief delay {{occurred}} when a stray kitten had made its way onto the outfield. On the very next pitch to Molina, he hit it 387 feet into the left field seats for a go-ahead grand slam. This was the 5th grand slam of his career, tying him with Tim McCarver for second-most career grand slams by a Cardinals catcher. This also {{proved to be the}} deciding hit in this game, as the Cardinals held up to win, 8–5.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{responded in}} the top of the 9th, scoring their only runs of the game. Kevin Tapani allowed {{successive}} singles to Brent Mayne and Mueller to open the inning before Terry Mulholland relieved him. Stan Javier singled to score Mayne and Ellis Burks then walked to load the bases. Bonds came to bat with <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded</b> for the second time in the game and lined out to deep right field, scoring Mueller on a sacrifice fly and Javier advanced to third base. Rod Beck entered and got successive outs by Jeff Kent, which scored Javier, and Joe Carter to end the game 5–3 for the Cubs.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees scored {{first with}} an Alex Rodriguez walk opening {{the bottom of}} the second inning {{followed}} by a two-run home run by designated hitter Hideki Matsui. The Phillies quickly responded with a triple by Carlos Ruiz who then scored on a sacrifice fly from Jimmy Rollins {{in the top of the}} third. Matsui answered back, adding to the Yankees lead again with a single with <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded</b> in {{the bottom of the}} third, scoring Derek Jeter and Johnny Damon. Damon, injured running the bases while scoring, was replaced defensively in the top of the fourth by Jerry Hairston, Jr.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>loaded</b> {{capacity}} {{is provided by}} the Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant, while the daily load regulation is provided by both the Sevan-Hrazdan Cascade and the Vorotan cascade hydropower plants. The aforementioned power plants are the primary domestic production energy sources while thermal power plants depend on imported gas. During fall, the NPP is not operational due to maintenance; therefore, the thermal power plants operate to provide <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>load</b> capacity, and also to meet the peak electricity demand in winter.|$|R
30|$|<b>Based</b> on <b>the</b> above analysis, <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>load</b> {{component}} of <b>the</b> residential loads {{on a regular}} day during the n th year in the 2 nd sub-dataset (shown in Fig.  2 b) can be represented by <b>the</b> average <b>base</b> <b>loads</b> in <b>the</b> same year shown in Fig.  6 a or b. Then, the corresponding CSL component can be easily calculated by subtracting <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>load</b> component from <b>the</b> residential loads. Once all the CSL components of the residential loads in the 2 nd sub-dataset are obtained, one can generate the per-unit CSL profiles by normalizing the 48 load values of each component to their maximum load value. These per-unit load profiles are then collected to form the per-unit CSL pool.|$|R

5|$|With {{two outs}} in the 9th inning {{of a game}} against the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 28, 1998, Bonds became only the fifth player in {{baseball}} history to be given an intentional walk with <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded.</b> Nap Lajoie (1901), Del Bissonette (1928) and Bill Nicholson (1944) were three others in the 20th century who received that rare honor. The first to receive one was Abner Dalrymple in 1881. During {{a game against the}} Philadelphia Phillies on August 2, Bonds was hit by a pitch thrown by Ricky Bottalico, leading to Bonds charging the mound and triggering a bench-clearing brawl.|$|E
5|$|Brooklyn went hitless in {{the bottom}} of the eighth. They {{inserted}} Harry Taylor to pitch the top half of the ninth, in which, he held St. Louis hitless. With half an inning left to play, the Dodgers began to get hits off of Dickson. Galan doubled, and after Walker flied out, Ed Stevens tripled to score Galan and Furillo singled to score Stevens, after a wild pitch and a walk, Brecheen took over pitching duties for Dickson with St. Louis leading 8–3. Edwards singled off Brecheen and allowed Furillo to score, and after Cookie Lavagetto walked, the score was 8–4 with <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded.</b> The Cardinals kept the score from getting any closer, as Brecheen struck out the final two batters to end the game.|$|E
5|$|In an August 16 contest {{against the}} Marlins, Heyward hit {{two home runs}} for his first multi-home run game with the Cardinals. An {{important}} defensive play was on September 20 against the Cubs. With <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded</b> and no outs in the eighth inning, Addison Russell hit a fly ball that Heyward caught running and threw home to catcher Yadier Molina to tag out Anthony Rizzo by two steps, preserving a 4–3 win. In the second game of a doubleheader against Pittsburgh on September 30, Heyward hit his second career grand slam in an 11–1 win, giving the Cardinals their 100th victory of the season while clinching their third consecutive National League Central division title. He also robbed both Francisco Cervelli and Michael Morse of hits in this game.|$|E

30|$|Note that {{residential}} loads in RL during time-period 13 on regular weekdays (weekends) {{with their}} maximum temperatures being in [14, 27  °C] {{can be treated}} as <b>base</b> <b>loads</b> as there barely exist CSL and ACL. The average {{of them can be}} used as <b>the</b> actual <b>base</b> <b>load</b> that is included in the residential load in RL during time-period 13, as <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>loads</b> in <b>the</b> same time-period on regular weekdays (weekends) within a year are almost identical (which is discussed in Sect. 3.1). For the residential load in time-period 13 on a regular day with the maximum temperature being above 27  °C or below 14  °C (see Fig.  2 a), it can be treated as the summation of <b>the</b> CSL and <b>base</b> <b>load.</b> Subtract <b>the</b> identified (average) <b>base</b> <b>load</b> from this residential load, then one can obtain the CSL included in the residential load in RL during time-period 13.|$|R
5|$|To {{start the}} top of the fifth inning, Art Reinhart was put in as pitcher. Reinhart walked Combs and {{followed}} by giving up a run-scoring double to Koenig. He then walked Ruth and Meusel in succession to load the bases for Gehrig. Reinhart walked Gehrig, allowing Koenig to score and keeping <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded</b> with no outs. Hi Bell replaced Reinhart as pitcher, but {{he was not able to}} suppress the Yankees' offense. Lazzeri hit a sacrifice fly to right field, which scored Ruth and moved Meusel up to third base. Dugan then hit a weak groundball; he was thrown out at first by catcher O'Farrell, but Meusel scored and Gehrig went to second base. Bell then balked, moving Gehrig to third base. Severeid was walked, and pitcher Hoyt ended the inning by hitting into a force play at second base.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ninth}} inning, Sad Sam Jones, a 22-year veteran in the American League, {{replaced}} Dutch Ruether, who had replaced pitcher Shawkey. Jones gave up an inside-the-park home run to Thevenow. Thevenow {{had only two}} other home runs in his career, {{both of which were}} inside-the-park and during the 1926 regular season. Jones then walked Douthit and Hornsby and gave up a single to Southworth. With <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded</b> and two outs {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, Bottomley hit a fly ball to center fielder Earle Combs. The Yankees did not score in the bottom of the ninth inning, and lost the game to the Cardinals by a 6–2 score. Alexander pitched a complete game, allowed hits in only two of the nine innings and did not allow a Yankee hit after the third inning. He also had a series-high 10 strikeouts, allowing four hits, one earned run and one walk. Meanwhile, the Yankees' starter Shocker allowed ten hits and five earned runs, including a home run, in seven innings of work. Shawkey had a perfect inning with two strikeouts, while Jones gave up two hits and allowed two walks in the ninth inning.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2014 season, the Sounds, Metro Nashville, and the State of Tennessee {{finalized}} a plan {{to build}} a new ballpark to replace Greer Stadium {{at the beginning of the}} 2015 season. On August 27, 2014, the Sounds hosted the final game at Greer Stadium, an 8–5 loss to the Sacramento River Cats. In his only plate appearance, Nashville catcher Lucas May struck out swinging with a full count and <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded</b> to end the game. The announced attendance at the game was a standing-room-only crowd of 11,067, the first sellout since 2010, and the largest crowd since 2007. The team, led by veteran minor league manager Rick Sweet, finished the season with a 76–67 record, in second place, two-and-a-half games behind Memphis. Jimmy Nelson, the Brewers' top prospect at the start of the season, was elected PCL Pitcher of the Year; he received all but one of the votes. The Sounds severed ties with the Brewers, with whom they had had the longest affiliation in franchise history, after the 2014 season citing poor on-field performance from recent Brewers Triple-A teams.|$|E

30|$|The {{template}} pools can {{be generated}} via the dataset NRL. The generation procedures can be found Fig.  3. The dataset NRL is first divided into 2 sub-datasets. The residential load data on days with the maximum temperature being in [14, 27  °C] are gathered to form the 1 st sub-dataset and the other load data in NRL are collected to form the 2 nd sub-dataset. As indicated in Fig.  4, the load in the 1 st sub-dataset can be treated as <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>load.</b> And <b>the</b> load in the 2 nd sub-dataset is <b>the</b> summation of <b>base</b> <b>load</b> and CSL. Then, the 48 load values of each day in the 1 st sub-dataset are normalized to their maximum load value to obtain <b>the</b> corresponding per-unit <b>base</b> <b>load</b> profile.

5|$|Affeldt {{spent the}} entire 2007 season in the bullpen, where he {{was used as a}} lefty specialist. Affeldt had a 2.15 ERA through his first fiftysix games of the year. He did not give up a home run until Pete Laforest hit one off of him in an 119 loss to the San Diego Padres on August 16. He {{struggled}} {{at the end of the}} year, with a 7.30 ERA in his final nineteen games. He still finished the year 43, with a 3.51 ERA in seventy-five games, and the Rockies made the playoffs as the NL Wild Card. He made his postseason debut on October 4 in the Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies and gave up one run (on a home run by Ryan Howard) in one inning in a 105 win by Colorado. The Rockies swept the series to advance to the Championship Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks. In the first game, Affeldt entered with two outs and <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded</b> with the Rockies leading 51. He retired Stephen Drew to help the Rockies win 5–1. The Rockies swept the Diamondbacks to meet the Boston Red Sox in the World Series. Affeldt pitched in all four games of the World Series without giving up a run, but the Rockies were swept by the Red Sox. Affeldt became a free agent after the season.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} 12appearances of 2009, Rivera {{surrendered}} four {{home runs and}} had a 3.97ERA, leading to speculation about his cutter's effectiveness and his shoulder's health at age 39. As the season progressed, his numbers improved, and he reached a milestone on June28 by becoming the second pitcher with 500regular season saves. In the same game, while batting against fellow closer Francisco Rodríguez, he collected his first career run batted in by walking with <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded.</b> With 23saves in 24opportunities and a 2.43ERA in the season's first half, Rivera was named an All-Star for the tenth time. At the 2009 MLB All-Star Game, he set a record by saving his fourth career All-Star Game. In the season's second half, Rivera allowed earned runs in only two of his final 40appearances, while he set a new personal best for consecutive save opportunities converted with 36. He finished the regular season with a 1.76ERA, 44saves in 46opportunities, and a 0.90WHIP. In the postseason, he pitched 16innings, allowing one earned run and saving five games, and he clinched the Yankees' victory in the 2009 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies—his fifth championship. He was the only closer who did not record a loss or blown save that postseason. Rivera collected several awards at season's end, including his third Delivery Man Award, his fifth AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, and the 2009 Sporting News Pro Athlete of the Year Award. Reflecting on the decade's end, ESPN.com's Jerry Crasnick called Rivera the most valuable major league pitcher of the previous 10 years.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Phillies claimed Jerome Williams off waivers and {{designated}} O'Sullivan for assignment, Williams {{started in the}} opener of a two-game series with the Angels in Los Angeles. Williams threw five shutout innings before giving up two runs in the sixth; Bastardo then gave up five more, and the Angels won 7–2. The Phillies also lost the second game, 4–3, as A. J. Burnett's inconsistency continued. The second (and final) series of the road trip pitted the Phillies against the San Francisco Giants. Hamels started game one, allowing a three-run homer in the fourth inning to give the Giants a 3–0 lead. The Phillies rallied, with a Marlon Byrd {{home run in the}} fifth inning and a two-run homer by Cody Asche to tie the game in the eighth. In the tenth, Chase Utley was hit by a pitch with <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded</b> (scoring one run) and Howard added a sacrifice fly to give the Phillies a 5–3 victory and Papelbon a save. In the second game, the Phillies jumped to a 5–1 lead before a sixth-inning infield error fueled a Giants rally. When Sandberg came out to remove Kendrick from the game, the pitcher stormed off the field in disgust; the Giants won, 6–5. The Phillies also lost the series' rubber match, 5–2; despite a quality start from Buchanan and Asche's three hits, the Giants had strong hitting by Michael Morse and Brandon Crawford.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees {{immediately}} {{took advantage}} of Sherdel {{in the top of}} the tenth inning. Koenig led things off by singling into left field. Sherdel threw a wild pitch to Ruth, and Koenig advanced to second base. Ruth then walked, and Meusel followed with a sacrifice bunt straight to pitcher Sherdel. Meusel was out at first base, but Ruth and Koenig were safe at second and third base, respectively. Gehrig was intentionally walked, loading the bases. Lazzeri hit a fly ball to left field, and Koenig tagged up on the play to score a run and give the Yankees a one-run lead. Mike Gazella, in place of Joe Dugan at third base, was hit by a pitch from Sherdel. With <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded</b> again, Severeid popped up to second baseman Rogers Hornsby to end the Yankee rally. The Cardinals got a single from Thevenow in the bottom of the tenth inning, but they could not score any runs. The game ended with the Yankees winning by a score of 3–2. Both Pennock and Sherdel pitched ten-inning complete games. Sherdel gave up nine hits and two earned runs, while walking five and striking out two. Pennock finished the game giving up just seven hits and two runs, while striking out four batters.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's 2012 season {{would be}} short-lived. With the Giants leading the Colorado Rockies 4–1 {{entering}} {{the bottom of}} the ninth inning on April 12, he made his second appearance of the season to get the save for the Giants. He walked in a run to make it 4–2, but retired Marco Scutaro with <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>loaded</b> to earn the save. He injured his elbow during the game and underwent Tommy John surgery for the second time in his career on April 19, causing him to miss the remainder of the season. During his injury shortened season, Wilson made only 2 appearances with an ERA of 9.00 and 1 save. The Giants went on to win their second World Series in three years. Wilson expressed confidence in an interview on April 15 that he would return to the Giants in 2013. However, because he was coming off an injury and would be owed at least $6.8 million for 2013, he was non-tendered after the season, which made him a free agent for the first time in his career. As of the end of the 2012 season, he ranked third all-time in saves as a Giant with 171, behind only Robb Nen (206) and Rod Beck (199).|$|E
