30|$|Certain {{management}} practices help to maintain {{both economic and}} environmental sustainability in planted forests used for timber production. The rotation period is especially important in silvicultural management, as it determines logging intervals, and can dramatically affect stand conditions (Bettinger et al. 2009). For example, changes in the rotation period can alter the age distribution in a stand, potentially skewing it towards a population of younger trees. Previous studies have defined rotation periods in various terms, such as physical, technical and financial parameters, depending on the forest management objective (Bettinger et al. 2009; Hiley 1967). Numerous studies have also shown that the physical rotation age, {{which is based on}} the life span of a tree, varies greatly between species. For example, Sequoia sempervirens (D.Don) Endl. and Alnus rubra Bong. have physical rotation values of over 1000 and less than 100  years, respectively (Harrington 1990; Olson et al. 1990). Another definition, the <b>technical</b> <b>rotation</b> age, is based on the size of tree a particular economic market requires.|$|E

Brockley Abstract: The effects of factorial combinations of post-thinning density and fertilization on the growth and development of young lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) were investigated in central British Co-lumbia. The effects of density and fertilization (repeated every 5 years) on tree height were small relative to the effects on stem radial growth. Tree radial growth increased with thinning intensity, whereas per-hectare growth was greatest at the highest residual density. Fertilizer effects varied across the range of residual densities tested. Tree and stand volume gains following fertilization were less, in both relative and absolute terms, at 600 trees/ha than at 1100 or 1600 trees/ha. Vigorous response of understory vegetation to nutrient additions (and strong competition for water and nutri-ents) may have reduced the effectiveness of fertilization on tree growth at 600 trees/ha relative to higher stand densi-ties. Results indicate that the combined positive effects of thinning and fertilization on the growth of young lodgepole pine will accelerate stand development, thereby shortening <b>technical</b> <b>rotation</b> length. Results also indicate that signifi-cant growth gains following fertilization of thinned lodgepole pine will partially compensate for stand volume losses due to thinning. However, fertilization may be less effective at low stand densities, where negative effects of thinning on harvest volume are greatest.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with the plantations of Acacia niloticagrown for sawlog -to produce railway sleeper- production along the Blue Nile, South of Sennar dam, Sudan. The overall objective {{was to determine the}} best management strategy of the plantations that maximizes financial returns. Primary data was collected using standard work study techniques and inventory methods. Secondary data used included previousstudies on yield tables and volume estimations. The study used the criterion of net present value (NPV) for determination of financial rotation, and for evaluating different management strategies. The research applied comparative statistics to assess relative stocking of existing stands. The research revealed that the operations of seed sowing and singling were the most expensive forest operations involving 5. 8 and 7. 8 mandays per feddan, respectively. Log transport was the most expensive sawmilling-related operation involving 36 mandays and 3 machine days per feddan. With the current conversion factor of state sawmills of about 40 %, the <b>technical</b> <b>rotation</b> of stands of site index 22 to produce sawlogs large enough to yield the maximum of a single sleeper was estimated to be within a range of 25 - 36 years. That of stands of site index 25 to yield the maximum of two sleepers falls within the range 25 - 36 years. Stands of site index 28 are technically suitable to produce sawlogs large enough to yield the maximum of three sleepers within age range of 29 - 36 years. These results exclude stands of site index 16 and 19 from producing saw logs for sleeper production. A. nilotica stands under present management show low relative stocking and yield per feddan, low millable percentage of final cut (47 %) and rotation age dropped to 25 - 27 years...|$|E
40|$|What are the {{performances}} of different stockless organic crops systems? And more specifically, are there rotations more efficient than other for economic, technical and / or environmental criteria? This work aims to present the method of co-construction of simulated cases for an evaluation of economic, environmental and <b>technical</b> performances, at <b>rotation</b> and production system scale. Fifteen «test cases» have been defined in the partner regions of CASDAR projects ROTAB and ProtéAB and evaluated {{with a set of}} quantitative and non-aggregated indicators (tool Systerre ®). The results provided many references at different scales. In the current context, profitability was ensured for all cases studied, but the production environment had a major impact on the overall performance. Long rotations with multiannual crop rotation (often alfalfa), sometimes less economically efficient, had strong advantages regarding agricultural sustainability. They also seemed to be less sensitive to changes in economic conditions and provided that the crop harvest was performed by a company, (it requires less work time). The typical cases are upgradeable tools to be adapted to different simulations or prospective studies...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims at measuring carbon (C) {{stock of}} gmelina (Gmelina arborea Roxb.) agroforestry {{system and its}} carbon diynamics due to several harvesting rotations. Observation was conducted during March – October 2014, on 17 plots in private forest, located in Tasikmalaya and Banjar District, West Java Province. The C-stock measurement followed Rapid Carbon Stock Appraisal Method (RaCSA) with some additional analysis. The dynamic of C-stock was measured based on biological <b>rotation,</b> <b>technical</b> rotation- 1 (harvesting at tree diameter of 15 cm) and technical rotation- 2 (harvesting at tree diameter of 20 cm). The result of the study shows that average of C-stock in gmelina agroforest stand is 170 ton/ha, consisted of 64 ton/ha above ground C and 106 ton/ha below ground C. Biological rotation (8 years) results in maximum C-stock of 15 ton/ha at harvesting time, while the time averaged-C stock is 7 ton/ha/year. Technical rotation- 1 (14 years) and technical rotation- 2 (24 years) result in maximum C-stock of 23 ton/ha and 28 ton/ha respectively, while the time averaged-C-stock are 12 ton/ha/year and 18 ton/ha/year respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the seismic {{behavior}} of existing RC precast buildings. This structural typology has been characterized by a very quick development since the time of the First World War, due to the reduction of construction time and to the possibility of a better check on each structural element produced in the factories through industrial processes. The main activities carried out in RC precast facilities are certainly associated to the industrial sector, thanks to large spans and high usable height. Therefore, the concept of loss for these buildings is not only related to human lives or to the repair costs, but also to the costs due to the interruption of the activities carried out in them. Emilia earthquake, occurred in May 2012, has sadly demonstrated the inadequacy of industrial facilities in absorbing horizontal seismic forces, causing deaths and injuries, as well as a huge economic loss. The earthquake consequences on industrial buildings are presented {{in the first part of}} the thesis, through the description of the reported damage of some facilities inspected after the earthquake. For each industrial building, the main geometrical issues are analyzed, along with the description of the principal structural elements. Among the investigated buildings, two industrial facilities located in Mirandola (MO), a few kilometers away each other, are considered as case-study buildings. The first structure reported the partial collapse due to the breaking of two central columns, with the fall of beams and tiles. The second facility reported only minor damages, such as the fall of a corner cladding element. A tridimensional numerical model has been implemented in order to first verify the seismic performance of the first building, according to the Italian code. Thus, nonlinear static and dynamic analyses have been performed. The N 2 method by Fajfar was used, taking into account the flexibility of the roof. Therefore, two different methods for the definition of the displacement control point are followed: one is based on geometrical considerations (proposed method); the other is based on the procedure proposed by Casarotti in its Adaptive Capacity Spectrum Method. At the end of each analysis, both fragile and ductile mechanisms have been checked. The most suitable capacity models have been then selected. In particular, columns shear capacity evaluation have been conducted through the study of the models available in the <b>technical</b> literature. Then, <b>rotations</b> at the columns base have been investigated, as well as the frictional behavior of the tiles-to-beams and beams-to-columns connections. Nonlinear dynamic analysis gave less conservative results than the nonlinear static analysis. In both cases, the obtained results show the frictional connections to be inadequate to adsorb the seismic forces. Comparison between the nonlinear static analysis results obtained following both formulations for the control point definition demonstrated the validity of the proposed method. In order to validate the model, nonlinear dynamic analyses have been carried on using as input signals the acceleration components recorded by one of the Italian RAN stations. The comparison between experimental and theoretical results have been conducted in order to verify the numerical model capability to predict the real damages suffered by the building. For this reason, the model has been completed taking into account the crane, positioned as evidenced by the photos taken shortly after the earthquake. The numerical model has proven to be capable to predict the real damages reported by the building, showing the shear failure of the most stressed columns. In particular, the crane presence has proved to be fundamental in order to justify the columns shear failure. Furthermore, the theoretical-experimental comparison has corroborated the validity of the adopted models. The same modeling issues have been adopted implementing a tridimensional model of the second case-study building. Corresponding columns belonging to both structures have been considered in order to study the different behavior of the facilities. From the comparison it is shown that the first building is subjected to higher shear forces due to larger masses. Furthermore, the vertical component of the earthquake has significantly affected the columns shear capacity, reducing it in correspondence with the minimum axial load values. Finally, a tridimensional model of the second facility taking into account the horizontal cladding panels have been implemented, in order to study their influence on the vibration periods, comparing the seismic response with the bare model one. Results show that the choice, in the numerical model, of the panels constraint typology affects decisively the vibration periods values. In particular, the choice of rigid constraints reduces significantly all the vibration periods; the use of semi rigid constraints results in a reduction of the higher modes vibration periods...|$|R
