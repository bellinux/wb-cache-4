500|$|Reviewing {{the episode}} for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen said that Timicin {{served as an}} [...] "excellent foil" [...] for Lwaxana and made her [...] "seem less ridiculous". [...] The {{relationship}} between Lwaxana and Timicin [...] "has a believable core", {{even if it is}} [...] "broad and arguably rushed", writes Handlen. [...] "There are some powerful moments... and it's pleasant for once to see Lwaxana adding, rather than subtracting, from a storyline." [...] Handlen, however, criticizes the setup of Timicin's situation, as it reduced the characterization available to some of the Enterprise crew. In spite of its flaw, Handlen decides that [...] "the episode largely redeems itself by staying true to its main point: No matter how much <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> left, it's never enough." ...|$|E
500|$|Observing Wenger's {{transfer}} policy in 2009, Sir Alex Ferguson commented that it lacked balance and needed defensive players to solidfy the Arsenal team. The players Wenger recruits {{have often been}} criticised for their character and leadership capabilities; footballer Joey Barton suggested {{it was because the}} manager discouraged them from commanding: [...] "Sometimes you need someone to galvanise and that might be a shouter and bawler. It may not be Arsene's way, but I think they lack that". Wenger is perceived as frugal given his inactivity in transfer windows, but he has denied the stereotype: [...] "Of course people say always to buy but you cannot make careers [...] buy every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> an injured player. You know I have the wrong reputation. I'm not scared to spend money. The job of a manager is not to spend as much money".|$|E
500|$|The group {{purposely}} {{cut short}} {{the amount of}} time set aside for recording the album, and did not notify its label before beginning work on the record. The members hoped that these steps would bring them back to the days when they were a young, broke band who had to finish an album before the money ran out. [...] "There was something really interesting about that creative process when we were starting out," [...] explained Stump. [...] "The more <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> the more potential you have for excess." [...] He felt that the process was reminiscent of the making of Take This to Your Grave because both albums were created using a [...] "first-thought, best-thought" [...] mentality: [...] "I think we were trying to find what making a record that way would sound like now, but with four adult Fall Out Boys." [...] Trohman called the recording process [...] "fun because [...] was so collaborative," [...] but difficult because it was rushed.|$|E

500|$|That's {{really hard}} {{because you have}} to gauge the weather each <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to make a decision. As for what {{happened}} last night, I can't comment. I don't have that information. But in general, our people take great care in making decisions based on the information that they have at the time. Premier Shawn Graham said [...] "I just want to extend sympathies to the affected families. This is a tragic situation for the community of Bathurst and our province." [...] Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper said the incident had [...] "shocked the nation" [...] and called for a day of mourning. Valery Vienneau, Bishop of Bathurst, read a message on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI stating: [...] " [...] expresses sentiments of deep sympathy and spiritual closeness to the members of their families and to all staff and students who have been touched by this tragedy. The Pope assures all concerned of his prayers for those who died and for their families." ...|$|E
500|$|Zaillian {{discussed}} many of {{the themes}} in Larsson's Millennium series with Fincher, taking the pair deeper into the novel's darker subjects, such as the psychological dissimilarities between rapists and murderers. Fincher {{was familiar with the}} concept, from projects such as Seven (1995) and Zodiac (2007). Zaillian commented, [...] "A rapist, or at least our rapist, is about exercising his power over somebody. A serial killer is about destruction; they get off on destroying something. It's not about having power over something, it's about eliminating it. What thrills them is slightly different." [...] The duo wanted to expose the novels' pivotal themes, particularly misogyny. [...] "We were committed to the tack that this is a movie about violence against women about specific kinds of degradation, and you can't shy away from that. But at the same <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to walk a razor thin line so that the audience can viscerally feel the need for revenge but also see the power of the ideas being expressed." [...] Instead of the typical three-act structure, they reluctantly chose a five-act structure, which Fincher pointed out is [...] "very similar to a lot of TV cop dramas." ...|$|E
500|$|NPR writer Linda Holmes {{challenged}} the show's assertions of female empowerment. Finding the episode itself [...] "silly {{and full of}} bad dialogue" [...] and [...] "cheesy more than offensive", Holmes questioned how a series about women whose conduct and appearance were micromanaged could simultaneously claim that those regimented women were uniformly empowered by the experience. She opined that [...] "you can shake a Bunny tail and be empowered, no argument. It depends on what's {{going on in the}} rest of your life. But shaking a Bunny tail isn't enough to demonstrate empowerment if {{you have to go to}} Eddie Cibrian or Hugh Hefner for help every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a problem, and having the right not to be slapped on the behind when you deliver a cocktail isn't exactly a societal advance on the order of universal suffrage." [...] The series, she concluded, might have been better served had those involved positioned it as a camp soap opera and not tried to make a feminist statement. In concurrence, Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker criticized Hefner's narration, deeming it as delusional and stupid, and criticize the series for its stance on feminism. She wrote, [...] "The show wants things both ways: to glamorize the Playboy 'lifestyle' from a male point of view and also to try to persuade us that, although Bunnydom had its hardships and rigors—no gum chewing, constant smiling—wearing an uncomfortable skimpy uniform and putting a poufy fake tail on your butt meant you held the keys to the universe." [...] Television Blend's Kelly West was much more optimistic about the episode, and asserted that [...] "The Playboy Club offers a lot of shiny things to look at, but beyond that, there is a story beginning to develop and characters that, while not quite as original as they are nice to look at, are interesting and charismatic enough to carry the series." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said the Playboy brand and the lifestyle portrayed in the series was dated and uninterestingm calling it a [...] "bad show, period. The writing was weak, the acting spotty and the sexism too ridiculous and obvious to comment on more than once." [...] Alan Pergament, former critic for The Buffalo News, said of the show that [...] "the truth is [...] should have been a pay-cable series because without the sex it is pretty boring and tame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course they}} do," [...] {{returned}} the man. [...] "Sometimes <b>you</b> <b>have</b> it quite chilly after a hot day. Other <b>times</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> it suffocatin'--like the Black Hole of Calcutta--as it'll be to-night." ...|$|R

2500|$|You {{need more}} than just nudge ... Behavioural change {{interventions}} appear to work best when they're part of a package of regulation and fiscal measures ... all politicians love quick fixes ... {{one of the problems}} with all of this is if you really want to change people's behaviour it takes a very long <b>time</b> ... <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to look at a 20- to 25-year span before you get a full change of behaviour.|$|E
2500|$|His {{leadership}} style of consensual government, {{acting as a}} chairman rather than a president, won him much praise from historians and politicians alike. Christopher Soames, the British Ambassador to France during the Conservative government of Edward Heath and Cabinet Minister under Margaret Thatcher, remarked that [...] "Mrs. Thatcher was not really running a team. Every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a Prime Minister who wants {{to make all the}} decisions, it mainly leads to bad results. Attlee didn't. That's why he was so damn good." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the book's publication, Jackson {{wrote to}} Dickinson, [...] "I suppose by this <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen the Masque of Poets. I {{hope you have}} not regretted giving me that choice bit of verse for it." [...] Jackson also {{published}} {{a review of the}} book, singling out [...] "Success" [...] as [...] "undoubtedly one of the strongest and finest wrought things in the book", before noting conjecture on the poem's authorship would be worthless. Dickinson thanked the publisher Thomas Niles for including her poem, to which he responded somewhat apologetically: [...] "you have doubtless perceived [...] was slightly changed in phraseology." ...|$|E

2500|$|For example, Saint-Exupéry {{tells of}} a fox meeting the young prince during his travels on Earth. The story's essence is {{contained}} in the fox saying that [...] "One sees clearly only with the heart. The essential is invisible to the eye." [...] Other key morals articulated by the fox are: [...] "You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed," [...] and [...] "It is the <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> lost for your rose that makes your rose so important." [...] The fox's messages are arguably the book's most famous quotations because they deal with human relationships.|$|E
2500|$|After Challenger, Greene {{chose to}} retire as a flight director. In October 1987, {{after a short}} period working with a study group on lunar exploration, he was {{appointed}} head of NASA's safety division. The division had been created after the Challenger accident at {{the recommendation of the}} Rogers Commission, which saw its establishment as key in creating a new, more vigorous [...] "safety culture" [...] at NASA. However, Greene feared that too much introspection by NASA engineers could lead to a damaging loss of confidence. In an interview a year later, he said that NASA had been on [...] "a fantastic guilt trip," [...] adding that [...] "I believe NASA has been overly eager to defend itself against all critics. Any <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> an independent panel, you {{ought to be able to}} name a defense attorney for the status quo." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fifty {{to sixty}} actresses auditioned {{for the role}} of Anna. Baccarin was {{initially}} rejected following her audition, as Peters did not believe she had the right look for the role. He reconsidered, however, and believes that Baccarin brings a seriousness and [...] "commanding presence" [...] to the part. Baccarin has said of her role: [...] "being, I guess, the face of what people want to see... I think there's an aspect of politicians: You need to embody what everybody wants to see, and at the same <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> your own agenda." [...] Laura Vandervoort plays the Visitor Lisa. Vandervoort is unaware of Lisa's ultimate agenda, which she believes makes the creative process more exciting. She explained: [...] "My direction is to play her as honestly as possible, so I'm playing her as a human with a secret. I'm playing a young 17-year-old who is possibly in love." ...|$|E

2500|$|Barry Commoner {{has criticized}} Ehrlich's 1970 {{statement}} that [...] "When {{you reach a}} point where you realize further efforts will be futile, you may as well look after yourself and your friends and enjoy what little <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> left. That point for me is 1972." [...] Gardner has criticized Ehrlich for endorsing the strategies proposed by William and Paul Paddock in their book Famine 1975!. They had proposed a system of [...] "triage" [...] that would end food aid to [...] "hopeless" [...] countries such as India and Egypt. In Population Bomb, Ehrlich suggests that [...] "there is no rational choice except to adopt some form of the Paddocks' strategy as far as food distribution is concerned." [...] Had this strategy been implemented for countries such as India and Egypt, which were reliant on food aid at that time, they would almost certainly have suffered famines. Instead, both Egypt and India have greatly increased their food production and now feed much larger populations without reliance on food aid.|$|E
2500|$|UNESCO's Director-General Irina Bokova {{has warned}} that ISIL is {{destroying}} Iraq's cultural heritage, {{in what she}} has called [...] "cultural cleansing". [...] "We don't have time to lose because extremists are trying to erase the identity, {{because they know that}} if there is no identity, there is no memory, there is no history", she said. Referring to the ancient cultures of Christians, Yazidis and other minorities, she said, [...] "This is a way to destroy identity. You deprive them of their culture, you deprive them of their history, their heritage, and that is why it {{goes hand in hand with}} genocide. Along with the physical persecution they want to eliminate – to delete – the memory of these different cultures ... we think this is appalling, and this is not acceptable." [...] Saad Eskander, head of Iraq's National Archives said, [...] "For the first <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> cultural cleansing... For the Yazidis, religion is oral, nothing is written. By destroying their places of worship... you are killing cultural memory. It is the same with the Christians – it really is a threat beyond belief." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{they were}} signed to BBC Two, {{they became the}} hosts and fashion advisors for five series of the BBC style series What Not to Wear in 2001, where they used their {{knowledge}} on fashion and harsh comments to reform the appearances and style of the participants on the show. The duo became instantly renowned for their poking and prodding of the contestants, their straight-talking advice, and frequently referring to breasts as tits. The editor of ELLE, Sarah Bailey, has stated [...] "You just don't expect posh girls to grab your tits, call your trousers 'too clitty' and use words like 'pussy pelmet' but they do. You are so shocked by {{what they are saying}} that by the <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> recovered and thought of something to say they have whipped you out of your jeans and eased you into a Lycra cat suit." [...] They have stated that their relationship is more like a marriage and that being total opposites, they balance each other out. They cannot imagine working without each other and have even considered taking insurance out on their television partnership should something unforeseen happen. Woodall and Constantine have been accused of being patronising, but reject these claims.|$|E

2500|$|During the 2012 {{presidential primary}} campaign, {{when asked what}} the federal government’s role should be in {{responding}} to natural disasters, Romney suggested that responsibility for handling disasters should be taken from FEMA, the federal agency dedicated to disaster relief, and given to the states, or outsourced to the private sector: [...] "Every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> an occasion to take something {{from the federal government}} and send it back to the states, that's the right direction. And if you can go even further, and send it back to the private sector, that's even better. Instead of thinking in the federal budget, what we should cut -- we should ask ourselves the opposite question. What should we keep? We should take all of what we're doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we're doing that we don't have to do? And those things we've got to stop doing, because we're borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we're taking in." [...] Asked whether by that he specifically meant disaster relief, he replied, “we cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids. It is simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids, knowing full well that we'll all be dead and gone before it's paid off. It makes no sense at all.” ...|$|E
