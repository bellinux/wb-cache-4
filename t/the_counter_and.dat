5|$|In 1992, {{during its}} time under the {{ownership}} of Britain-based Grand Metropolitan, Burger King experimented with table service. After 4pm, customers would place their order at <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> <b>and</b> their order would be brought to them at their table. Customers were given complimentary popcorn to eat while waiting for their meal. To coincide with the offering, a series of meals called the Dinner baskets were introduced. The dinner baskets included the Whopper Dinner Basket, Steak Sandwich Dinner Basket, Fried Chicken Dinner Basket, and Shrimp Dinner Basket. In the New England region of the United States, BK sold a Fried clam Basket. The dinner came with two sides, including a choice of a side salad, cole slaw, French fries, or baked potato. Lasting approximately a year, the sit-down restaurant concept was abandoned in 1994 {{in favor of the}} original quick-service formula.|$|E

Twelve years after its inception, 3M developed its first exclusive product: Three-M-ite cloth. Other innovations in this era included masking tape, waterproof sandpaper, and Scotch brand tapes. By 1929, 3M had made its first moves toward international expansion by forming Durex to conduct business in Europe. The same year, the company's stock was first traded over <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>and</b> in 1946 listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

25|$|During {{his time}} at Glemham, Crabbe {{composed}} several novels, none of which were published. After Glemham, Crabbe moved {{to the village of}} Rendham in Suffolk, where he stayed until 1805. His poem The Parish Register was all but completed while at Rendham, and The Borough was also begun. 1805 was the last year of Crabbe's stay in Suffolk, and it was made memorable in literature by the appearance of the Lay of the Last Minstrel by Walter Scott. Crabbe first saw it in a bookseller's shop in Ipswich, read it nearly through while standing at <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> <b>and</b> pronounced that a new and great poet had appeared. In October 1805, Crabbe returned {{with his wife and two}} sons to the parsonage at Muston. He had been absent for nearly 13 years, of which four had been spent at Parham, five at Great Glemham, and four at Rendham.|$|E
500|$|Libby's {{method was}} soon {{superseded}} by gas proportional counters, which were less affected by bomb carbon (the additional [...] created by nuclear weapons testing). These counters record bursts of ionization {{caused by the}} beta particles emitted by the decaying [...] atoms; the bursts are proportional to {{the energy of the}} particle, so other sources of ionization, such as background radiation, can be identified and ignored. The counters are surrounded by lead or steel shielding, to eliminate background radiation and to reduce the incidence of cosmic rays. In addition, anticoincidence detectors are used; these record events outside <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> <b>and</b> any event recorded simultaneously {{both inside and outside the}} counter is regarded as an extraneous event and ignored.|$|E

500|$|The time per game, {{despite the}} counter always {{starting}} at 78, is by default 105 seconds and is adjustable by the game operator; changing the time adjusts both {{the speed of}} <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>and</b> how long a player spends crashed after hitting a pylon. A switch on the internal circuit board can turn off crashes entirely, while another allows for two games to be played for a quarter rather than one. A placard {{on the front of}} the game gives suggested ratings for the score in a given game, from [...] "License Revoked" [...] for 10 or fewer points to [...] "Real Pro" [...] for greater than 40; the operator's manual suggests changing or removing this card if the time per game is adjusted.|$|E

[...] However, he accidentally drenches Lois with boiling oil. While she is recovering, Child Protection Services take away Peter's custody of Meg, Chris, and Stewie {{on the grounds that}} Peter is mentally unfit to look after them. The three are placed in the care of Cleveland. When Brian tells Peter that he just has to show that he is a good parent, Peter thinks {{that the best way to}} do that is to show what a bad parent Cleveland is, so he brings seven prostitutes into Clevelandâ€™s house. This does not work as Agent Jessup sees through the plot and Cleveland orders Peter and five of the prostitutes out. In a last attempt, he appeals to the court for custody of the children, but he is denied and avoids imprisonment only because the judge forgets that prisons exist.|$|E

The man orders a BLT sandwich [...] "dripping with melted cheese" [...] and just when Ora is about to order he interrupts her by saying [...] "she's gonna have the same damn thing", which causes Ora {{to look at him}} somewhat upset. As Azalea arrives with the order, the man starts complaining about the sandwich and refuses to eat it. Then, the owner of the diner, Big Wanda, jumps over <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>and</b> asks if there's a problem. After hearing the man's complaint, Azalea tries to explain but to no avail when the owner says [...] "What did the Fox say? Nothing!" [...] and she is told to make another sandwich with more cheese. Ora is shocked when the owner begins to flirt with her boyfriend in front of her, and her boyfriend ignores her because the owner promises him a [...] "big, juicy BLT sandwich" [...] that is the menu's special. When Ora tries to speak up, she is verbally put down by the owner, who says her special order is [...] "nothing like the little sandwich" [...] Ora has. Ora continues to show disapproval towards the situation.|$|E

40|$|The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) is {{the latest}} {{generation}} of solar neutrino experiments designed to investigate the Solar Neutrino Problem (SNP). Through detection of all flavors of neutrinos, SNO will be capable of testing the neutrino oscillation hypothesis {{as a solution to}} the SNP. This unique capability stems from the flavor independent Î½x (2 H, n Î½x) 1 H reaction (Î½x = Î½e or Î½ Âµ or Î½Ï„). Observation of this Neutral Current (NC) reaction is through detection of the free neutron. One method of detection utilizes an array of 3 He-filled proportional <b>counters,</b> <b>and</b> is called <b>the</b> Neutral Current Detector array (NCD array). This thesis describes the preliminary testing and characterization of <b>the</b> individual <b>counter</b> components of <b>the</b> array during an underground storage period at the SNO site. These tests were performed to verify the operational characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>counters,</b> assess <b>the</b> long-term stability of <b>the</b> <b>counters,</b> <b>and</b> measure potential backgrounds to the NC measurement in SNO.
