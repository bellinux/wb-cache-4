5|$|Discussions on {{improving}} the UN's effectiveness and responsiveness to international security threats often include {{reform of the}} UNSC veto. Proposals include: limiting the use of <b>the</b> <b>veto</b> to vital national security issues; requiring agreement from multiple states before exercising the veto; abolishing <b>the</b> <b>veto</b> entirely; and embarking on the transition stipulated in Article 106 of the Charter, which requires the consensus principle to stay in place. Any reform of <b>the</b> <b>veto</b> will be very difficult. Articles 108 and 109 of the United Nations Charter grant the P5 veto over any amendments to the Charter, requiring them to approve of any modifications to the UNSC veto power that they themselves hold.|$|E
5|$|Any {{reform of}} the Security Council would require the {{agreement}} of at least two-thirds of UN member states, and {{that of all the}} permanent members of the UNSC enjoying <b>the</b> <b>veto</b> right.|$|E
5|$|For example, the Security Council passed no resolutions on {{most major}} Cold War conflicts, {{including}} the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–Afghan War. Resolutions addressing more current problems, {{such as the}} conflict between Israel and Palestine and Iran's suspected development of nuclear weapons, are also heavily influenced by <b>the</b> <b>veto,</b> actual or threatened. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>veto</b> applies to {{the selection of the}} UN's Secretary-General, as well as any amendments to the UN Charter, giving the P5 great influence over these processes. Recently China also exercised its VETO on India's Resolution to put Masood Azhar on list of Global terrorist list. He is proclaimed head of Jaish E Mohammad a terror Outfit which is already designated as Global terrorist group by UNSC.|$|E
40|$|This paper explores <b>the</b> {{financial}} <b>veto</b> procedure {{established in}} the Standing Orders of the House of Representatives of New Zealand. The paper historically situates <b>the</b> financial <b>veto</b> by considering <b>the</b> traditional division of authorising power in public finance. It then sketches an outline of <b>the</b> financial <b>veto,</b> while noting that the scope of <b>the</b> financial <b>veto</b> is not entirely clear. The paper finds that <b>the</b> financial <b>veto</b> runs contrary to democratic principles; a proportionality analysis is used to determine that the procedure is an unjustified limitation on those principles. The abolition of <b>the</b> financial <b>veto</b> procedure is recommended, but alternative options for reform are also briefly considered...|$|R
5000|$|His term in Congress was {{notable for}} his censure on May 14, 1866 for {{an insult to}} the House of Representatives. The censure stemmed from a {{resolution}} he introduced expressing support for <b>the</b> <b>vetoes</b> of President Andrew Johnson, in which Chanler called acts of Congress vetoed by Johnson [...] "wicked and revolutionary," [...] and called House members who overruled <b>the</b> <b>vetoes</b> [...] "malignant and mischievous." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the history}} of the Security Council, almost half <b>the</b> <b>vetoes</b> were cast by the Soviet Union, with the vast {{majority}} of those being before 1965.|$|R
5|$|The {{winner of}} the Power of Veto {{competition}} {{won the right to}} save one of the nominated HouseGuests from eviction. If <b>the</b> <b>Veto</b> winner exercised the power, the Head of Household then had to nominate another HouseGuest for eviction.|$|E
5|$|A {{major issue}} in her initial {{election}} was whether the two candidates would vote to override President George W. Bush's veto of {{an expansion of the}} State Children's Health Insurance Program. Tsongas said she would vote to override, and it was reported Ogonowski would uphold <b>the</b> <b>veto.</b> Hours after being sworn into office on October 18, Tsongas voted to override, but the vote failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{brought his}} {{opposition}} to needless spending to the governor's office; he promptly sent the legislature eight vetos {{in his first two}} months in office. The first to attract attention was his veto of a bill to reduce the fares on New York City elevated trains to five cents. The bill had broad support because the trains' owner, Jay Gould, was unpopular, and his fare increases were widely denounced. Cleveland, however, saw the bill as unjust—Gould had taken over the railroads when they were failing and had made the system solvent again. Moreover, Cleveland believed that altering Gould's franchise would violate the Contract Clause of the federal Constitution. Despite the initial popularity of the fare-reduction bill, the newspapers praised Cleveland's veto. Theodore Roosevelt, then a member of the Assembly, had reluctantly voted for the bill to which Cleveland objected, in a desire to punish the unscrupulous railroad barons. After <b>the</b> <b>veto,</b> Roosevelt reversed himself, as did many legislators, and <b>the</b> <b>veto</b> was sustained.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> President <b>vetoed</b> {{only one}} bill, his first <b>veto,</b> <b>the</b> Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005.|$|R
2500|$|On the {{question}} of <b>the</b> royal <b>veto,</b> Mirabeau took a practical view and, seeing that the royal power was already considerably weakened, declared for <b>the</b> king's absolute <b>veto</b> and against <b>the</b> suspensive <b>veto.</b> He knew from his British experience that such a veto would be impractical unless the king knew the people were on his side, and {{that if it were}} used unjustifiably, the power of the purse possessed by the representatives of the people could bring about a bloodless revolution. The difference between <b>the</b> suspensive <b>veto</b> and <b>the</b> absolute was simple: <b>the</b> absolute <b>veto</b> gave <b>the</b> king the power to stop any law for an indefinite period of time. <b>The</b> suspensive <b>veto,</b> on <b>the</b> other hand, put limitations on the powers of the king. The final compromise was to allow the king a suspensive veto for a period of two years.|$|R
2500|$|For five years, the Commons and the Lords {{fought over}} one bill after another. The Liberals pushed through {{parts of their}} programme, but <b>the</b> Conservatives <b>vetoed</b> or {{modified}} others. When <b>the</b> Lords <b>vetoed</b> <b>the</b> [...] "People's Budget" [...] in 1909, the controversy moved almost inevitably toward a constitutional crisis.|$|R
5|$|In February 2013, the Philippine Senate {{passed a}} bill declaring waling-waling (Vanda sanderiana) as the {{national}} flower alongside Sampaguita. A similar bill in the House of Representatives had already been passed in 2012. Normally, the bill would become law after being signed by the President. However, it was vetoed by President Benigno Aquino III. <b>The</b> <b>veto</b> did not grant the waling-waling as the second national flower due to the confusion that it would create.|$|E
5|$|In the 1941 {{legislative}} session, Johnson vetoed {{a measure}} allowing {{the sale of}} alcoholic beverages to surrounding states, even those with laws forbidding alcohol sales. The bill was very popular, and was supported {{by many of the}} state's powerful special interests. It had passed the Kentucky House of Representatives by a vote of 84–0 and the Kentucky Senate by a vote of 31–3. After Johnson's veto, the House reversed itself, voting 86–3 to sustain <b>the</b> <b>veto.</b>|$|E
5|$|Reform of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) {{encompasses}} five key issues: {{categories of}} membership, {{the question of}} <b>the</b> <b>veto</b> held by the five permanent members, regional representation, {{the size of an}} enlarged Council and its working methods, and the Security Council-General Assembly relationship. Member States, regional groups and other Member State interest groupings developed different positions and proposals on how to move forward on this contested issue.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{theological}} <b>veto</b> is futile: One way {{to reject}} <b>the</b> theological <b>veto</b> is {{to assert that}} one cannot isolate reason from faith. Intelligible use of language is claimed to commit one to consistency, so to reject reason is to refuse to make sense. This argument asserts that even <b>the</b> theological <b>veto</b> itself must be consistent with itself and inconsistent with reason.|$|R

50|$|In United States government, <b>the</b> line-item <b>veto,</b> {{or partial}} <b>veto,</b> is <b>the</b> power of an {{executive}} authority to nullify or cancel specific provisions of a bill, usually a budget appropriations bill, without <b>vetoing</b> <b>the</b> entire legislative package. <b>The</b> line-item <b>vetoes</b> are usually {{subject to the}} possibility of legislative override as are traditional vetoes.|$|R
5|$|Sources {{from the}} time of the March 1605 {{conclave}} listed up to twenty-one possible candidates considered by the cardinals, but the only ones that were seriously discussed during the conclave were Cesare Baronius and Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici. That conclave saw Spain veto Cesare Baronius after the first ballot. Medici, the candidate who was finally elected, was also vetoed by the cardinal representing Spain but this occurred after the election of Leo XI, and the cardinals did not view <b>the</b> <b>veto</b> as valid.|$|E
5|$|The network {{largely ignored}} the {{standard}} business model of 1950s TV, {{in which one}} advertiser sponsored an entire show, enabling it to have complete control over its content. Instead, DuMont sold commercials to many different advertisers, freeing producers of its shows from <b>the</b> <b>veto</b> power held by sole sponsors. This eventually became the standard model for US television. Some commercial time was sold regionally on a co-op basis, while other spots were sold network-wide.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{exercised}} {{his presidential}} veto {{power for the}} first time on April 5, 1792 to stop an apportionment act from becoming law. The legislation introduced a new plan for distributed seats in the House of Representatives among the various states in a way that the president deemed unconstitutional. After attempting but failing to override <b>the</b> <b>veto,</b> Congress swiftly crafted new legislation, the Apportionment Act of 1792, which Washington signed into law on April 14.|$|E
50|$|Senators Russ Feingold (D-WI) and John McCain {{introduced}} legislation {{of a limited}} version of <b>the</b> line-item <b>veto.</b> This bill would give the president the power to withdraw earmarks in new bills by sending the bill back to Congress minus <b>the</b> line-item <b>vetoed</b> earmark. Congress would then vote on <b>the</b> line-item <b>vetoed</b> bill with a majority vote under fast track rules to make any deadlines the bill had.|$|R
50|$|Alabama {{is one of}} {{the states}} in which the {{governor}} has the power to accept or reject any particular item of an appropriation bill without <b>vetoing</b> <b>the</b> entire bill. In this event, only <b>the</b> <b>vetoed</b> item of <b>the</b> appropriation bill is returned to the house of origin for reconsideration by the Legislature. The remainder of the bill becomes law.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1990, the Illinois {{legislature}} assembled for a veto session to primarily discuss major state finance controversies. The funding for {{an expansion of the}} McCormick Place convention center in Chicago, restoring previous budget cuts as well as extending an expiring income tax surcharge were all topics of debate. None of <b>the</b> <b>vetoed</b> bills however were able to rally the votes necessary to override <b>the</b> governor's <b>veto.</b>|$|R
5|$|As the House of Councillors can veto a {{decision}} made by the House of Representatives, the House of Councillors can cause the House of Representatives to reconsider its decision. The House of Representatives however, can still insist on its decision by overwriting <b>the</b> <b>veto</b> by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority of its members present. Each year, and when required, the National Diet is convoked at the House of Councillors, {{on the advice of}} the Cabinet, for an extra or an ordinary session, by the Emperor. A short speech is, however, usually first made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives before the Emperor proceeds to convoke the Diet with his Speech from the throne.|$|E
5|$|Democrats in the General Assembly were outraged. When the 1930 {{legislative}} session convened, they immediately {{passed a bill}} that stripped Sampson of his power to appoint a highway commissioner, giving it to a three-person commission composed of the governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general. The Republican Sampson would be outnumbered and outvoted in this group. Confident that the Democrats would not lose another gubernatorial election, Democratic legislators stipulated in the bill that the appointment power {{would return to the}} governor in 1931, the end of Sampson's term. The law passed the House by a vote of 53—42 and the Senate by a vote of 22—15. Sampson vetoed the bill, but <b>the</b> <b>veto</b> was overridden, and Johnson was returned to his former position.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, Dow spoke {{before the}} {{legislature}} {{in favor of}} statewide prohibition. The bill passed, but lacked the enforcement mechanisms necessary to give it effect. The following year, {{he ran for the}} state legislature in a special election, but was narrowly defeated. In 1850, now a member of the new Free Soil Party, he encouraged like-minded legislators to pass a stronger prohibition law. They did so, but saw it vetoed by Democratic governor John W. Dana. The legislature fell one vote short of overriding <b>the</b> <b>veto.</b>|$|E
50|$|When the Legislature reconvened in 1919 {{with a new}} {{governor}} in office, <b>the</b> <b>vetoed</b> institutions were given appropriations and reopened. The Legislature then created another institution, the Miami School of Mines (now Northeastern Oklahoma A&M College).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> line-item <b>veto,</b> {{or partial}} veto, {{is a special}} form of veto that authorizes a chief {{executive}} to reject particular provisions of a bill enacted by a legislature without <b>vetoing</b> <b>the</b> entire bill. Many countries have different standards for invoking <b>the</b> line-item <b>veto,</b> if it exists at all. Each country or state has its own particular requirement for overriding a line-item veto.|$|R
50|$|Moakley was {{prominent}} in the opposition to <b>the</b> legislative <b>veto,</b> which became an increasingly popular device in the 1970s. He held up in committee a controversial bill proposed by Rep. Elliott Levitas that proposed to institute <b>the</b> legislative <b>veto</b> as a general feature of legislation. His position was vindicated when the Supreme Court held in INS v. Chadha (1983) that <b>the</b> legislative <b>veto</b> violated <b>the</b> bicameralism and presentment clauses of the U.S. Constitution.|$|R
5|$|In 2005, Romney {{revealed}} {{a change of}} view regarding abortion, moving from the pro-choice positions expressed during his 1994 and 2002 campaigns to a pro-life one in opposition to Roe v. Wade. Romney attributed his conversion to an interaction with Harvard University biologist Douglas Melton, an expert on embryonic stem cell biology, although Melton vehemently disputed Romney's recollection of their conversation. Romney subsequently vetoed a bill on pro-life grounds that expanded access to emergency contraception in hospitals and pharmacies (the legislature overrode <b>the</b> <b>veto).</b> He also amended his position on {{embryonic stem cell research}} itself.|$|E
5|$|In some matters Tyler was on {{good terms}} with Jackson. He defended Jackson for vetoing the Maysville Road funding project, which Jackson {{considered}} unconstitutional. He voted to confirm several of the president's appointments, including Jackson's future running mate Martin Van Buren as United States Minister to Britain. The leading issue in the 1832 presidential election was the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States, which both Tyler and Jackson opposed. Congress voted to recharter the bank in July 1832, and Jackson vetoed the bill for both constitutional and practical reasons. Tyler voted to sustain <b>the</b> <b>veto</b> and endorsed the president in his successful bid for re-election.|$|E
5|$|Outside of the Western hemisphere, Hayes's biggest {{foreign policy}} concern dealt with China. In 1868, the Senate had {{ratified}} the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing an unrestricted flow of Chinese immigrants into the country. As the economy soured after the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing workmen's wages. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, anti-Chinese riots {{broke out in}} San Francisco, and a third party, the Workingman's Party, was formed {{with an emphasis on}} stopping Chinese immigration. In response, Congress passed a Chinese Exclusion Act in 1879, abrogating the 1868 treaty. Hayes vetoed the bill, believing that the United States should not abrogate treaties without negotiation. <b>The</b> <b>veto</b> drew praise among eastern liberals, but Hayes was bitterly denounced in the West. In the subsequent furor, Democrats in the House of Representatives attempted to impeach him, but narrowly failed when Republicans prevented a quorum by refusing to vote. After <b>the</b> <b>veto,</b> Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W. Seward suggested that both countries work together to reduce immigration, and he and James Burrill Angell negotiated with the Chinese to do so. Congress passed a new law to that effect, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, after Hayes left office.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{theological}} <b>veto</b> is self-defeating: Another way <b>the</b> theological <b>veto</b> {{is rejected}} is {{to assert that}} rejection of critical control over one's beliefs, as for instance by the requirement of evidence, lowers the barrier against bigotry, fanaticism, and persecution.|$|R
50|$|Governor Pete Ricketts, {{serving his}} first year in office, <b>vetoed</b> <b>the</b> {{legislation}} on May 26, but the legislature voted 30-19 to override <b>the</b> governor's <b>veto</b> on May 27.|$|R
5000|$|The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007 (...) , was {{proposed}} federal {{legislation that would}} have amended the Public Health Service Act to provide for human embryonic stem cell research.
