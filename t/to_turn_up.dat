The basic idea was to create songs with sing-along choruses. Rundgren did not pre-plan who would play on the sessions, but simply wanted anyone who happened to be in or near the studio <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> and learn the material.|$|E

5|$|Kemper {{then put}} {{both of the}} women's bodies {{in the trunk of}} his Ford Galaxie and {{returned}} to his apartment, being stopped on the way by a police officer for a broken taillight but managing not to be detected for his more serious offences. His roommate was not at home, so he took the bodies into his apartment, where he took pornographic photographs of, and had sex with, the naked corpses before dismembering them. He then put the body parts into plastic bags, which he later abandoned near Loma Prieta Mountain. Before disposing of Pesce's and Luchessa's severed heads in a ravine, Kemper engaged in irrumatio with both of them. In August, Pesce's skull was found up on Loma Prieta Mountain. An extensive search failed <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> the rest of her remains or a trace of her companion.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{was born}} in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, and {{brought up in the}} working-class area of Tinsley. The family later moved to the village of Catcliffe after his father set up a (then-illegal) betting shop. This brought greater {{prosperity}} but also misery; one day Banks's disabled brother was mugged for the shop's daily takings, and died of his injuries some weeks later. Banks left school in December 1952 and took up employment as a bagger with a local coal merchant, which helped to build up his upper body strength. He spent a season playing for amateur side Millspaugh F.C. after their regular goalkeeper failed <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> for a match; the club's trainer spotted Banks amongst the spectators and invited him to play in goal as he was aware that Banks had previously played for Sheffield Schoolboys. His performances there earned him a game in the Yorkshire League for Rawmarsh Welfare, however a 12–2 defeat to Stocksbridge Works on his debut was followed by a 3–1 home defeat, and he was dropped by Rawmarsh and returned to Millspaugh. Still aged 15, he then switched jobs to become a hod carrier.|$|E
5|$|The {{video is}} set at night and opens with Brown, {{dressed in a black}} suit, {{drinking}} alcohol in the streets, before hailing a futuristic hover-cab. Brown asks the cab driver {{to take him to the}} best spot in town. He then asks the driver <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> the air conditioner because he's hot, but the driver turns up the music instead, while wearing a horse mask on his head. As the song begins, Brown exits the cab and arrives at a street party filled with people wearing animal heads. He then enters a club, where he performs the first dance sequence in the video with his male backup dancers. During the first chorus, Brown arrives inside the main room of the club filled with flashing lights and people dancing while wearing animal heads. After a hat gets tossed to him by one of his dancers in the crowd, Brown and his backup dancers perform another dance sequence as the queen of the party watches them from her perch. These party scenes are intercut with scenes of Brown dancing alone in another room surrounded by flashing lights and speakers in the background.|$|E

5|$|Abel Starkey was {{a native}} of Roxbury, Massachusetts. The story of Starkey's capture was {{published}} by George Hubbard in The New England Magazine. Starkey was part of a gang of counterfeiters, including Stephen Burroughs, Samuel Corson and James Smith. Pursued by the authorities, Abel Starkey disappeared in the vicinity of a lightning splitter home that was owned by the Shephardson family. A thorough search of the house was conducted and the authorities found nothing. According to Hubbard, the house was the refuge of the counterfeiters for a number of years. After a time the public and authorities continued to track members of the gang to the location and investigations were performed only <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> empty. Sheriff Johnson of Worcester tracked the counterfeiters to the house one day and set up a team of men outside and inside the house to uncover and arrest the counterfeiters. A careful search turned up nothing, so measurements of the house were taken to make sure no secret rooms or areas existed. With the inaccessible third attic all but ruled out, the discovery of its access through the chimney was by chance when an officer emptied out his trash into the fireplace. Contained in the trash was some snuff and a sneeze came from above, alerting the officers of hidden occupants in the chimney. After the fire had been extinguished and raked out, Sheriff Johnson attempted to climb up into the chimney. A brick was dropped from above and wounded him. The authorities capped the chimney and smoked the counterfeiters until they fell unconscious. Starkey was amongst the three arrested counterfeiters.|$|E
