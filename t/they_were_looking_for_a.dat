5|$|A casting {{call was}} {{announced}} by Suresh Productions for {{the roles of}} Venkatesh's daughters in the film. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> girl aged 14–17 years {{to play the role}} of the elder daughter named Anjali, and another aged 8–12 years to play her younger sibling, Anu. Esther Anil was confirmed to reprise her role as the younger sister. Kruthika Jayakumar, a 17-year-old science student from Bangalore, was selected {{to play the role of}} elder sister in the film. This happened when a Malayalam filmmaker visited her dance performance in Thiruvananthapuram, and was struck by her expressions and photogenic features. He suggested that she pursue a career in the film industry. She referred to her character as a simple and vulnerable girl, who gets exploited. Her family is her world and she is particularly attached to her father. Kalabhavan Shajon was initially reported to reprise his role of a corrupt police officer from the original, but Ravi Kale was chosen instead.|$|E

Joining siblings Milika and Mataika Koyamainavure after Fiji Basketball development officer Laisiasa Puamau confirmed the news. He then was brought into the Otago Nuggets to participate in their 2014 campaign after a respectable showing at the Oceania Championships in New Zealand. Player-coach, Mark Dickel decided to give Sowakula a call once <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> replacement for fellow Fijian, Marques Whippy. He made his debut starting from the bench during their match against the Taranaki Mountain Airs once he arrived in Dunedin from the previous week. Unfortunately his performances didn't live quite up to Dickel's standards after he believed Sowakula was not ready for the NBL, and instead called in former representative Tom Rowe as cover.|$|E

5|$|Gardstein's {{body was}} removed {{to a local}} {{mortuary}} where his face was cleaned, his hair brushed, his eyes opened and his photograph taken. The picture, and descriptions {{of those who had}} helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b> <b>A</b> local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassilleva, after she had told him she {{had been one of the}} people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information began to come in from the public and the group's associates: on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured.|$|E
5|$|International {{recognition}} {{of the new government}} did not prove to be difficult. The Western powers were not pleased with the Third Seimas when it ratified the non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union in September. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> government that would change the priorities of Lithuanian foreign policy. It was therefore not surprising that the British Daily Telegraph, the French Le Matin, and the United States' New York Times wrote that the coup was expected to curtail the move towards friendly relations with the Soviet Union and normalize relations with Poland; the anti-democratic and unconstitutional nature of the coup was not emphasized. The Western press reported the news calmly, or assessed it as a positive development in the Lithuanian struggle against Bolshevism. International diplomatic opinion held that a strong authoritarian leader would provide internal stability, and that even during the earlier years of the republic Lithuania had not been genuinely democratic, since many essential freedoms were curtailed under martial law.|$|E

25|$|Originally, Bandai never {{intended}} to develop a system with Internet connectivity in mind. However, Apple and Bandai received feedback from customers, indicating that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> system that could connect to the Internet. To make Internet connectivity possible, Apple had to incorporate a modem into the Pippin design. Two years earlier (1992), Apple had already {{moved away from the}} older serial interface with an external Hayes-compatible modem on its Macintosh systems, and switched to a serial interface which included GeoPort – a serial data technology that allowed software to emulate a modem. Implementing GeoPort into the Pippin platform required Apple to make a major change in its design – moving away from the 68030 footprint and to a PowerPC footprint. Apple chose the PowerPC 603 32-bit processor, as it was designed to be a low-cost, low-end processor for embedded use.|$|E

25|$|In fall of 1823, Jedediah Smith and Thomas Fitzpatrick led their {{trapping}} crew {{south from}} the Yellowstone River to the Sweetwater River. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> safe location {{to spend the}} winter. Smith reasoned since the Sweetwater flowed east it must eventually run into the Missouri River. Trying to transport their extensive fur collection down the Sweetwater and North Platte River, they found after a near disastrous canoe crash that the rivers were too swift and rough for water passage. On July 4, 1824, they cached their furs under a dome of rock they named Independence Rock and started their long trek on foot to the Missouri River. Upon arriving back in a settled area they bought pack horses (on credit) and retrieved their furs. They had re-discovered the route that Robert Stuart had taken in 1813—eleven years before. Thomas Fitzpatrick was often hired as a guide when the fur trade dwindled in 1840. Jedediah Smith was killed by Indians around 1831.|$|E

He regarded the story, its historical and social context, and collaborating again with Blanchett as motivating factors for his involvement. [...] "What was so interesting to me when I first read this script", Haynes said, [...] "is how it basically links that hothouse mentality of the desiring subject ... to that of the criminal subject, in that both are these over-productive minds that are conjuring narratives constantly ... this crazy state of this furtive hyperactivity in the mind."
