MTV Overdrive {{streamed}} a tour diary featuring the band's experiences with footage recorded at various concerts. MTV2 filmed a special of the Welcome <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> Tour depicting Thirty Seconds to Mars, Head Automatica and Cobra Starship, which aired on November 4, 2006. It also recorded a television special featuring the bands touring alongside Thirty Seconds to Mars. Footage recorded during the Welcome <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> Tour was released on the deluxe edition of the band's album A Beautiful Lie on December 5, 2006.|$|E
5|$|The Welcome <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> Tour was {{a concert}} tour by American rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars, {{in support of}} their second studio album A Beautiful Lie (2005). Presenting a series of {{inexpensive}} concerts for music fans, the concert tour was announced in August 2006 {{as a part of}} the MTV2 $2Bill tour. The Welcome <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> Tour began on October 17, 2006 in Minneapolis, Minnesota and ended on November 25, 2006 in Los Angeles, California. The setlist encompassed songs from their first two studio albums, 30 Seconds to Mars and A Beautiful Lie.|$|E
5|$|Fez (stylized as FEZ) is an indie puzzle-platform {{video game}} {{developed}} by Polytron Corporation {{and published by}} Trapdoor. The player-character Gomez receives a fez that reveals his two-dimensional (2D) world {{to be one of}} four sides of a three-dimensional (3D) world. The player rotates between these four 2D views to realign platforms and solve the game's puzzles. The object of the game is to collect cubes and cube fragments to restore order <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b>|$|E

5|$|Labelled as a green tour, Thirty Seconds to Mars {{developed}} {{strategies that}} minimized fuel consumption of all touring vehicles.

5|$|Allen and {{his family}} moved to Burlington in 1787, which was no longer a small {{frontier}} settlement but a small town, and much more to Allen's liking than the larger community that Bennington had become. He frequented the tavern there, and began work on An Essay on the Universal Plenitude of Being, which he characterized as an appendix to Reason. This essay was less polemic than many of his earlier writings. He affirmed the perfection of God and His creation, and credited intuition as well as reason as a way to bring Man closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> The work was not published until long after his death, and is primarily of interest to students of Transcendentalism, a movement the work foreshadows.|$|E
5|$|Fez is a {{two-dimensional}} (2D) puzzle platform game {{set in a}} three-dimensional (3D) world. The player-character Gomez lives peacefully on a 2D plane until he receives a red fez and witnesses the breakup of a giant, golden hexahedron that tears the fabric of spacetime and reveals a third dimension. After the game appears to glitch, reset, and reboot, the player can rotate between four 2D views of the 3D world, as four sides around a cube-like space. This rotation mechanic reveals new paths through the levels by connecting otherwise inaccessible platforms, and {{is the basis of}} Fez puzzles. For example, floating platforms become a solid road, discontinuous ladders become whole, and platforms that move along a track stay on course. The object of the game is to collect cubes and cube fragments, which accrete to restore order <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> In search of these cubes, Gomez traverses the game environment by jumping between ledges. Other platforming elements change with the level themes, including crates that activate switches, bombs that reveal passages, and pistons that launch Gomez airborne.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of general relativity is that it can be applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> as a whole. A key point is that, on large scales, our universe appears to be constructed along very simple lines: all current observations suggest that, on average, the structure of the cosmos should be approximately the same, regardless of an observer's location or direction of observation: the universe is approximately homogeneous and isotropic. Such comparatively simple universes can be described by simple solutions of Einstein's equations. The current cosmological models of the universe are obtained by combining these simple solutions to general relativity with theories describing the properties of the universe's matter content, namely thermodynamics, nuclear- and particle physics. According to these models, our present universe emerged from an extremely dense high-temperature state –the Big Bang– roughly 14 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since.|$|E
5|$|The Einstein field {{equations}} are nonlinear {{and very}} difficult to solve. Einstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory. But as early as 1916, the astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild found the first non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the Schwarzschild metric. This solution {{laid the groundwork for}} the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes. In the same year, the first steps towards generalizing Schwarzschild's solution to electrically charged objects were taken, which eventually resulted in the Reissner–Nordström solution, now associated with electrically charged black holes. In 1917, Einstein applied his theory <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> as a whole, initiating the field of relativistic cosmology. In line with contemporary thinking, he assumed a static universe, adding a new parameter to his original field equations—the cosmological constant—to match that observational presumption. By 1929, however, the work of Hubble and others had shown that our universe is expanding. This is readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by Friedmann in 1922, which do not require a cosmological constant. Lemaître used these solutions to formulate the earliest version of the Big Bang models, in which our universe has evolved from an extremely hot and dense earlier state. Einstein later declared the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life.|$|E
