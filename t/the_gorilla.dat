5|$|Donkey Kong 64 is a 1999 {{adventure}} platform {{video game}} for the Nintendo 64 console, and {{the first in the}} Donkey Kong series to feature 3D gameplay. As <b>the</b> <b>gorilla</b> Donkey Kong, the player explores the themed levels of an island to collect items and rescue his kidnapped friends from K. Rool. The player completes minigames and puzzles as five playable Kong characters—each with its own special abilities—to receive bananas and other collectibles. In a separate multiplayer mode, up to four players can compete in deathmatch and last man standing games.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{took place}} over several days at Music Bank, the famous {{rehearsal}} studios in London. Actor Michael spent forty hours practising the drumming beforehand, but with vision inside the suit limited to a camera feed piped to a small screen inside the head, precision was almost impossible. Many takes ended with the wooden drum sticks broken against the rims, sending shards of wood flying off-camera. This, combined with the difficulty of choreographing the delicate movements of <b>the</b> <b>gorilla</b> head with Michael's acting, meant that 35takes were required to produce the final 90-second scene.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> eastern <b>gorilla</b> is more darkly {{coloured}} than <b>the</b> western <b>gorilla,</b> with <b>the</b> mountain <b>gorilla</b> being <b>the</b> darkest of all. <b>The</b> mountain <b>gorilla</b> {{also has}} <b>the</b> thickest hair. <b>The</b> western lowland <b>gorilla</b> can be brown or grayish with a reddish forehead. In addition, gorillas {{that live in}} lowland forests are more slender and agile than the more bulky mountain <b>gorillas.</b> <b>The</b> eastern <b>gorilla</b> also has a longer face and broader chest than <b>the</b> western <b>gorilla.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> western lowland <b>gorilla</b> {{belongs to}} <b>the</b> family Pongidae, which {{includes}} <b>the</b> great apes: <b>gorillas,</b> chimpanzees, bonobos (pygmy chimpanzees) and orangutans. There are two recognized species of <b>gorilla,</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>gorilla</b> (<b>Gorilla</b> <b>gorilla),</b> and <b>the</b> Eastern <b>gorilla</b> (G. beringei).

5|$|The idea of Ranko brought {{together}} two popular fictional {{creatures of the}} 1930s; the giant ape King Kong, who had been introduced in the film King Kong (1933), and the Loch Ness Monster, a cryptid who was to have lived in Loch Ness. Gaston Leroux's character of Balaoo <b>the</b> <b>gorilla,</b> who had appeared in a 1911 book and a 1913 film, might also have been an influence on Ranko. The plot and themes of the story were also influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 film The 39 Steps, itself an adaptation of John Buchan's 1915 adventure novel.|$|E
5|$|Waxworks {{impressed}} Carl Laemmle, the German-born {{president of}} Universal Pictures. Laemmle {{was struck by}} Leni's departure from expressionism by the inclusion of humor and playfulness during grotesque scenes. Meanwhile, in the United States, D. W. Griffith's One Exciting Night (1922) began a Gothic horror film trend that Laemmle wanted to capitalize on; subsequent films in the genre like Alfred E. Green's now lost The Ghost Breaker (1922), Frank Tuttle's Puritan Passions (1923), Roland West's The Monster (1925) and The Bat (1926), and Alfred Santell's <b>The</b> <b>Gorilla</b> (1927)—all comedy horror film adaptations of Broadway stage plays—proved successful.|$|E
5|$|During that time, Shapiro {{instructed}} ex-captive orangutans in {{the acquisition}} {{and use of}} signs following the techniques of psychologists R. Allen Gardner and Beatrix Gardner, who taught the chimpanzee, Washoe, in the late 1960s. In the only signing study ever conducted in a great ape's natural environment, Shapiro home-reared Princess, a juvenile female, which learned nearly 40 signs (according to the criteria of sign acquisition used by psychologist Francine Patterson with Koko, <b>the</b> <b>gorilla)</b> and trained Rinnie, a free-ranging adult female orangutan, which learned nearly 30 signs over a two-year period. For his dissertation study, Shapiro examined the factors influencing sign learning by four juvenile orangutans over a 15-month period.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} a study {{examining}} the ability of western lowland gorillas to give to and exchange with humans. This involved humans holding objects such as fruit, leaves or peanuts in one hand. Once <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> had given twigs to the humans, they would receive one of these objects. If <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> did not give them a twig, they would not get their desired object. <b>The</b> <b>gorillas</b> were shown to quickly learn about receiving rewards as mistakes made by <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> in <b>the</b> beginning of the experiments gradually decreased.|$|R
50|$|When day breaks, {{they return}} to the city, {{discovering}} hieroglyphs that say that the people had taught <b>the</b> grey <b>gorillas,</b> a unique species due to the volcanic environment, to guard the mine and kill anyone that approached it. The group suspects that <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> turned on their masters but still protect the mine now. They find the diamond mine and Homolka starts to collect large diamonds, but a pack of gorillas appear and kill him. Munro, Karen, and Peter fight off <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> and flee deeper into the mine, where they discover Charles' body, holding a giant blue diamond. As Amy helps to fend off <b>the</b> <b>gorillas,</b> Karen is able to fit the diamond into a portable laser, using it to fire and ward off <b>the</b> <b>gorillas.</b> <b>The</b> volcano begins to erupt, and Munro, Karen, Peter, and Amy escape as the city is flooded with lava, killing <b>the</b> <b>gorillas.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Cross River <b>gorilla</b> at <b>the</b> Kagwene Mountain in Cameroon {{has been}} {{observed}} using tools {{and it seems to}} be unique to the population in this region. They have been observed in three separate cases, in which they threw grass at the researchers, a detached branch and in a third case, in which an encounter with a man, who threw rocks at them led them to throw back fistfuls of grass. All the encounter had <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> in <b>the</b> group observe the researchers and react to their presence with vocalizations then led to calm behavior in the parts of <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> and finally an approach by <b>the</b> male <b>gorillas</b> and <b>the</b> throwing of grass at the researcher. The researchers have stated that this throwing behavior might have arisen due to human contact in the field and farms surrounding the mountain and the ambivalent nature of <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> is due to the surrounding people not hunting <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> due to <b>the</b> folklore about <b>the</b> <b>gorillas.</b>|$|R
5|$|Mulder {{contacts}} Frohike and Byers, who {{say that}} Fairfield {{is known for its}} animal disappearances and UFO sightings. They also mention Ambrose's gorilla, who is known to communicate using American Sign Language. Meanwhile, Scully follows one of Lang's activists as he sneaks into the zoo, running into Meecham inside. The activist attempts to free a tiger, but after a flash of light, the tiger seemingly disappears. The activist is promptly mauled to death, with the killing captured on his night vision camera. When questioned, Lang denies any responsibility for the death. Ambrose introduces the agents to <b>the</b> <b>gorilla,</b> Sophie, who has been cowering in her cage and expresses an apparent fear of light.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong is {{the first}} example of a {{complete}} narrative told in video game form, and like 1980's Pac-Man, it employs cutscenes to advance its plot. The game opens with <b>the</b> <b>gorilla</b> climbing a pair of ladders {{to the top of}} a construction site. He sets Pauline down and stomps his feet, causing the steel beams to change shape. He then moves to his final perch and sneers. This brief animation sets the scene and adds background to the gameplay, a first for video games. Upon reaching the end of the stage, another cutscene begins. A heart appears between Mario and Pauline, but Donkey Kong grabs the woman and climbs higher, causing the heart to break. The narrative concludes when Mario reaches the end of the rivet stage. He and Pauline are reunited, and a short intermission plays. The gameplay then loops from the beginning at a higher level of difficulty, without any formal ending.|$|E
25|$|The next {{entry in}} the series is {{considered}} curious: <b>The</b> <b>Gorilla</b> Mystery (October 1, 1930). The short starts with Beppo <b>the</b> <b>Gorilla</b> escaping from a zoo. Mickey learns of it and panics. He phones Minnie to warn her about the dangerous gorilla wandering about. Minnie is unconcerned and plays tunes on her piano for Mickey to hear over the phone and know she is not afraid. Her tunes are interrupted by her scream and Mickey rushes to her house to save her. Meanwhile, Beppo has wrapped up Minnie in rope and holds her hostage. Mickey confronts <b>the</b> <b>gorilla</b> and once again rescues the damsel in distress. The short ends with Minnie and Mickey jointly wrapping up <b>the</b> <b>gorilla</b> in rope. Modern audiences have commented on elements of bondage apparent in the short and the mysterious motivation of Beppo. Note that the theme of kidnapping by a gorilla is present here three {{years prior to the}} King Kong film of 1933.|$|E
50|$|Bugs Bunny, fed up {{with the}} unfair game and <b>the</b> Gas-House <b>Gorillas</b> playing dirty, talks trash against <b>the</b> <b>Gorillas,</b> {{claiming}} that he could win the game single-handed with an endless barrage of home runs. He loses a bit of his bravado when he suddenly gets surrounded by <b>the</b> <b>Gorillas.</b> His challenge is forced on him by <b>the</b> <b>Gorillas</b> and, as a result, Bugs now has to play all the positions on the opposing team, including speeding from the mound to behind the plate to catch his own pitches.|$|R
2500|$|Animals {{have also}} felt the impact, with 200 of the world's 700 {{mountain}} gorillas {{living in a}} rebel-held park. A spokeswoman for the Virunga National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, stated that <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> were [...] "threatened" [...] due to the gorillas' tendencies not to avoid gunfire or loud sounds, putting the nearly extinct animals at risk. Also, the inability of park rangers to get to <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> due to <b>the</b> rebel occupation was cited as dangerous, as <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> could not receive aid. On November 25, park rangers were allowed back into the park due to terms of the peace treaty, and plan to spend a month surveying <b>the</b> <b>gorillas</b> to assess their condition.|$|R
50|$|In the {{alternate}} timeline of the Flashpoint event, Changeling was member of <b>the</b> hyper-intelligent <b>gorillas</b> attacking in Namibe. When Traci Thirteen freed the citizens, Changeling betrays <b>the</b> <b>gorillas.</b> He turns into an insect and flies inside a Gorilla's head, before turning {{back into a}} human, tearing <b>the</b> <b>Gorilla's</b> head apart. He is told by Traci Thirteen {{to take care of}} the citizens.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> Amarillo <b>Gorillas</b> were a {{minor league}} hockey team based in Amarillo, Texas. The team was most {{recently}} affiliated with the now defunct Central Hockey League (CHL) from 2001-10. <b>The</b> <b>Gorillas</b> began play in 1996 as the Amarillo Rattlers in the Western Professional Hockey League (WPHL) until the WPHL was bought by the CHL in 2001. They would continue to use the Rattlers name until an ownership change in 2002. As the Rattlers, the team frequently finished {{at the bottom of}} the WPHL and CHL divisions, but made the playoffs four straight years after becoming <b>the</b> <b>Gorillas</b> until <b>the</b> 2006-2007 season. <b>The</b> <b>Gorillas</b> played in <b>the</b> Amarillo Civic Center.
