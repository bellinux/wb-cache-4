6000|$|... 'Don't {{stand there}} {{chattering}} to yourself like that,' Humpty Dumpty said, {{looking at her}} for the first time, 'but <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name</b> and your business.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must be a}} brave man {{to venture}} into the country again after such an experience. Won't you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name?</b> We may meet on the Inside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Will you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name,</b> my dear?' said Honora, {{feeling the}} {{children}} {{the easiest to}} talk to; but the little girl's pretty lips pouted, and she nestled nearer to her father.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{reminds me}} of a crow I have to pluck with you, Mr. Marmaduke Lind. What did you mean by <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name</b> was Sharp?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing of the sort!" [...] {{cried the}} captain, fiercely. [...] "How dare you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name's</b> Matilda? <b>Your</b> <b>name</b> is Julia. Who am I?--Hold that basket of {{sandwiches}} straight, or I'll pitch {{it into the}} sea!--Who am I?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir, {{you speak}} well," [...] she answered. [...] "Be pleased ere we separate, to meet no more perchance, to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>names</b> that I may {{remember}} them and hand them down among my people {{from generation to}} generation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd best go on alone now. But I'm very {{grateful}} to you! Please <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name.</b> I'd love to know who my friend is, though I never shall forget his kindness." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Sir Tristram said: [...] "Sir Knight, I pray you for to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name</b> and degree, for {{it seems}} to me that you are someone very high in order of knighthood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{forth from}} behind that big shield of yours," [...] he said. [...] "Come out and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name</b> and lineage--you {{who would do}} battle with the Unconquered for the ancient axe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a noble spirit!" [...] Mrs. Pomfret exclaimed {{aside to}} Mrs. Chillingham. Then she added, in a louder tone, [...] "Ladies, {{if you will}} kindly <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>names,</b> I shall be happy to {{introduce}} you to the candidate. Well, Victoria, I didn't expect to see you here." ...|$|R
50|$|And said kind Sir {{be civil}} and <b>tell</b> to <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "That is generous of you, Lady," [...] {{the officer}} {{answered}} {{in the midst}} of the laughter which followed. [...] "Now will you add to <b>your</b> goodness by <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name?</b> You refuse? Then shall I help you? In the late Coptic war it was my happy fortune twice to see a certain noble maiden, the daughter of Magas the Prince, whom the Emir Musa afterwards took for himself, but who fled from him. <b>Tell</b> <b>me,</b> Lady, have you a twin sister?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Morgante, [...] "thanks to you, your God shall {{henceforth}} be my God. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name,</b> {{and afterwards}} dispose {{of me as}} you will." [...] And he {{told him that he}} was Orlando.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on, sonny! Nobody's hit you. Come, I ain't goin' to eat yeh." [...] He took a bit {{of money}} from his pocket. [...] "Come here and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name.</b> I {{want to talk with}} you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Messire," [...] quoth {{the white}} knight, [...] "I struck upon your shield so that I might summon you hither for to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name,</b> for I have asked it of your esquire {{and he will}} not tell me." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{thought of}} the weapon, and guessed that the letter he had just {{received}} had effected this change in his mood, but made no observation till {{he went on to}} say, 'What did you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> was <b>your</b> <b>name,</b> dear girl?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Madame Marillac gently {{signed to}} Stella {{to close the}} pocketbook again. [...] "That kind heart of yours must not be distressed about trifles," [...] she said. [...] "The baker will trust us until we get the money for our work--and my {{daughter}} knows it. If you can <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> nothing else, my dear, will you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> Christian <b>name?</b> It is painful to me {{to speak to you}} quite as a stranger." ...|$|R
6000|$|So Sir Launcelot {{prepared}} to depart, and whilst {{he was in}} his chamber making ready there came in unto him Sir Ector de Maris. And Sir Ector said unto him: [...] "Sir, I prithee tell me--is it true that you bear upon your right shoulder a mark like unto a golden star?" [...] And Sir Launcelot made reply: [...] "Yea, that is true." [...] Then Sir Ector said: [...] "I beseech you to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> if <b>your</b> <b>name</b> is Launcelot." [...] And Sir Launcelot said: [...] "Yea, that is my name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll do it," [...] cried Eddie. [...] "The {{minute they}} get {{money for the}} pay I'll hike. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name.</b> I'll ask her ef she remembers you when I get home. Gee! but I wish I was walkin' {{in the front door}} now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Messire," [...] said King Angus, [...] "I {{perceive}} {{that you are}} no ordinary knight, but somebody of high nobility and estate, so it shall be as you desire." [...] And then King Angus said: [...] "I pray you, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name</b> and whence you come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Messire," [...] {{said the}} white knight, [...] "since {{you ask me}} that upon my knighthood, I cannot refuse to tell you my name. And so I will do, {{provided}} you, upon your part, will do me a like courtesy and will first <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name</b> and degree." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then the damsel said, [...] "Sir Knight, I pray you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what is <b>your</b> <b>name</b> and <b>your</b> degree?" [...] To the which Sir Ewaine made reply: [...] "My name is Sir Ewaine and I am King Uriens' son of Gore, and {{my mother}} is Queen Morgana, surnamed Le Fay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, if I {{intended}} to do you harm, little lad, the readiest way were to leave you here. What! you do not fear to sit beneath the gallows on a new-made grave, and yet you tremble at a friend's touch. Take heart, child, and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what is <b>your</b> <b>name</b> and where is your home?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Freddy," [...] {{his host}} says, with a cheerful air of lifelong {{friendship}} and confidence, [...] "you know {{that everybody has}} got two <b>names.</b> Of course <b>your</b> first <b>name</b> is Freddy, and it's a very pretty name. Well, I {{want you to think}} real hard, and then <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what <b>your</b> other <b>name</b> is, so I can take you back to your mamma." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Sir Launcelot {{turned to}} that knight {{to whom he}} had brought aid in that matter, and he said: [...] "Sir Knight, these knights yield {{themselves}} unto you to do as you command them. Now I pray you of your courtesy to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name</b> and who you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now King Bagdemagus {{had never}} before seen Sir Launcelot, so he knew not who that knight was. Wherefore he said to him: [...] "Messire, I am much beholden to you for coming to my aid in this battle. Now I pray you that you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name</b> and what knight you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Sidenote: Sir Percival bespeaketh {{the strange}} knight] Meantime that knight came riding up with great haughtiness of bearing to where Sir Percival was, {{and when he}} had come nigh enough he bespake Sir Percival, saying: [...] "Sir Knight, I pray you to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name</b> and whither you go, and upon what quest?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because of {{that fight}} and that leap," [...] Ayesha went on, [...] "as for other deeds {{that you have}} done and will do, my Spirit <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> that <b>your</b> <b>name</b> will live in story for many generations. Yet of what use is fame to the dead? Therefore I make you an offer. Bide here with me and you shall rule these Amahagger, and with them the remnant of the People of Rezu. Your cattle shall be countless and your wives the fairest in the land, and your {{children}} many, for I will lift a certain curse from off you so that no more shall you be childless. Do you accept, O Holder of the Axe?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Croft {{had noticed}} on the {{preceding}} day that her coolness towards him still continued, {{but it did}} not suit him to let her know that he perceived it. He went up to her, and in a very friendly way remarked: [...] "There is something I wish very much you would <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> What is <b>your</b> <b>name?</b> It is very odd that during all the time I have been acquainted with you I have never known your name." ...|$|R
6000|$|She started up. [...] "Are you an English gentleman?" [...] she said. [...] "Ah, I {{have always}} longed {{to see an}} English gentleman. I have never seen but one Englishman since we lived here, and he {{certainly}} was not a gentleman--no white people at all, indeed, except a few wandering Boers. We live among black people and baboons--only I have read about English people--lots of books--poetry and novels. But <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what is <b>your</b> <b>name?</b> Macumazahn the black man called you, but {{you must have a}} white name, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who is it? Who is it?" [...] muttered Higgs. [...] "The face is {{the face}} of--of--I have it--of old Adams, only he's been dead these ten years. The Khalifa got him, they said. Antique shade of the long-lost Adams, please be so good as to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name,</b> for we waste time over a useless mystery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Has {{she been}} teasing you?" [...] said the lady. [...] "Well, never mind, don't think {{any more about}} it. She's an impudent hussy, I know--they all are, and one has {{to put up with}} them. Now sit down here and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name,</b> and where you live, and all about yourself, and why you go out {{cleaning}} steps for a living." ...|$|E
6000|$|And the White Champion also leaned {{upon his}} sword and panted, and anon he said, [...] "Sir, I pray you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> <b>name.</b> For I make my vow to you that never have I met any knight who hath fought a greater battle than you have fought this day--and yet I may tell you that I have fought with {{a great many of}} the very best knights of this realm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Explanations are needless, young man," [...] he said, in a {{measured}} and melodious voice, [...] "for my {{studies of the}} matter have already informed me of {{more than you can}} <b>tell.</b> Let <b>me</b> see; <b>your</b> <b>name</b> is Adrian van Goorl--no, called Van Goorl; the lady you desire to win is Elsa Brant, the daughter of Hendrik Brant, a heretic and well-known goldsmith, who was recently executed at The Hague. She is a girl of much beauty, but one unnaturally insensible to the influence of love, and who does not at present recognise your worth. There are, also, unless I am mistaken, other important circumstances connected with the case.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Look up here, {{my little}} prickler, and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what <b>your</b> <b>name</b> is.--My <b>name</b> is pin.--Ah, <b>your</b> <b>name</b> is pin, is it? How bright you are! How came {{you to be}} so bright?--Oh, they brightened me when they made me.--Indeed! And how did they make you?--They made me in a machine.--In a machine? That's very curious! How did they make you in the machine? Tell us all about it!--They made me out of wire. First the machine cut {{off a piece of}} the wire long enough to make me, and then I was carried around to {{different}} parts of the machine to have different things done to me. I went first to one part to get straightened. Don't you see how straight I am?--Yes, you are very straight indeed.--Then I went {{to another part of the}} machine and had my head put on; and then I went to another part and had my point sharpened; and then I was polished, and covered all over with a beautiful silvering, to make me bright and white.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked over}} her {{shoulder}} toward the house. [...] "Not here! I've run away from a she-devil; I want to be out of sight. Further away, Mister--I don't know <b>your</b> <b>name.</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> name; I won't trust you, unless you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> name!" ...|$|R
