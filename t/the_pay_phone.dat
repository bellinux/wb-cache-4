2500|$|A {{payphone}} or {{pay phone}} {{is a public}} telephone, usually located in a stand-alone upright container such as a phone booth, with payment done by inserting money (usually coins), a credit or debit card, or a telephone card before the call is made. Pay telephone stations preceded the invention of <b>the</b> <b>pay</b> <b>phone</b> and existed as early as 1878. These stations were supervised by telephone company attendants or agents who collected the money due after people made their calls. In 1889, the first coin-operated telephone was installed by inventor William Gray at a bank in Hartford, Connecticut. However, it was a [...] "postpay" [...] machine that only accepted coins deposited after the call was placed.|$|E
2500|$|Edgartown Police Chief James Arena {{arrived at}} the scene about 10 or 15 minutes later. After {{attempting}} unsuccessfully to examine {{the interior of the}} submerged vehicle, Arena summoned a commercial diver along with equipment capable of towing or winching the vehicle out of the water. Diver John Farrar arrived at 8:45 equipped with scuba gear and discovered Kopechne's body; he extricated it from the vehicle within 10 minutes. Police checked the car's license plate {{and saw that it was}} registered to Kennedy. Kennedy was still at <b>the</b> <b>pay</b> <b>phone</b> by the ferry crossing and heard that his car and Kopechne's body had been discovered; he crossed back to Edgartown and went to the police station. Gargan simultaneously went to the hotel where the [...] "boiler room girls" [...] were staying to inform them about the incident.|$|E
2500|$|Two acquaintances of Markhasev, Sara Peters and Michael Chang, {{testified against}} {{him at the}} grand jury. Peters and her boyfriend, Eli Zakaria (who refused to testify, invoking his Fifth Amendment right to not {{incriminate}} himself), were with Markhasev {{on the night of}} the murder and were high on cocaine and heroin. She testified they had stopped to use <b>the</b> <b>pay</b> <b>phone</b> at a park-and-ride lot about [...] from where Cosby had pulled over to fix his flat tire. Peters testified that while Zakaria was on the phone, Markhasev walked off without saying where he was going. Within a few minutes, Peters heard a loud noise like a car backfiring, and Markhasev ran back to the car, saying, [...] "Let's go. We've got to get out of here. Let's go." [...] Markhasev refused to tell them what had happened, but they stopped at a wooded area that matched the description of where the murder weapon was later discovered.|$|E

2500|$|Chrétien's key {{campaign}} man was Jim Karygiannis {{who became}} a living legend within the Liberal Party due to his ruthlessness. Chrétien told Lavelle that what he wanted was [...] "A tough guy. A guy who could go on a search-and-destroy mission, who could do a kamikaze raid for our side", and decided that Karygiannis was that man. At a meeting to select Liberal delegates for the Kitchener-Waterloo riding, Martin's supporters attempted to call on the pay phones as many potential Martin supporters as possible {{to come to the}} meeting, which led Karygiannis to put chewed gum into all of <b>the</b> <b>pay</b> <b>phone</b> coin slots, and thereby won Kitchener-Waterloo for Chrétien. At another delegate selection meeting, Karygiannis verbally attacked a pro-Martin Liberal official with such rage that the man was hospitalized for angina. Karygiannis specialised in signing up immigrants to serve as delegates for Chrétien, and personally signed 9,500 immigrants as Chrétien delegates between January and June 1990, leading one pro-Martin official to lament that [...] "We were getting Greeked. And if we weren't getting Greeked, we were getting Sikhed". Karygiannis later boasted in an interview that [...] "I signed up anything that moved". Chrétien is said to have praised Karygiannis with the remark [...] "Whatever it takes to win, Jimmy, whatever it takes to win". In large part because of Karygiannis and his team, by late April 1990 Chrétien had signed up 1,500 delegates to Martin's 500 delegates, making him the clear front-runner.|$|E

They’re having a collective experience in which they literally bring different pieces, one to the next, swap them back and forth, gossip about them. They have an element of cocreation and a collaborative nature that doesn’t really have an analog that I’ve been able to think of in the arts.|$|R

40|$|Many times {{technological}} developments add to and improve {{what we already}} have, thereby increasing the welfare of society. There are also examples, both historic and present, where {{technological developments}} imply negative welfare consequences {{for at least some}} part of society. The relative size of that part differs from case to case, as does the relative harm in each situation. This paper outlines some of the historic examples of decreased welfare due to technological improvements, and discusses the concept in relation to the case of <b>the</b> disappearing <b>pay</b> <b>phone,</b> or public telephone. <b>Pay</b> <b>phones</b> have been in use since the late nineteenth century (Oslin, 1992). Inevitably with the invention of cellular <b>phones,</b> <b>the</b> demand for <b>pay</b> <b>phones</b> decreased. In turn, profits decreased, leading phone companies to eradicate millions of <b>pay</b> <b>phones</b> throughout <b>the</b> United States. Many people prefer to use <b>pay</b> <b>phones,</b> but this is becoming increasingly inconvenient and impractical. The second half of this paper presents an economic model that may be useful in evaluating these welfare consequences...|$|R
5000|$|A clear box is an {{amplifier}} used by phreaks to use post-pay {{pay phones}} without paying. In some locations, especially rural {{areas in the}} United States and Canada, pay phones were configured for [...] "post-pay" [...] operation. In this mode, the handset microphone is muted until payment is made. The user of a post-pay pay phone would dial first, wait until the called party answered, {{and at that point}} the user would be prompted to insert the coins. Upon receiving the correct payment for the call, <b>the</b> <b>pay</b> <b>phone</b> would then connect the microphone and allow the caller to speak. An artifact of this scheme was that the called party usually heard the ACTS tones produced by <b>the</b> <b>pay</b> <b>phone</b> upon coin deposit.|$|E

5000|$|In Brazil, The prefix is [...] "0800" [...] - {{although}} {{phone numbers}} are 8 digits - it {{is followed by}} 7 digits - 6 digits are being phased out. Toll-free numbers in Brazil can be accessed from any telephone (by default) in Brazil, with many exceptions. They can be accessed from outside Brazil only with a calling service (such as voice-over-Internet services or MCI Worldcom calling service) that accesses numbers from within the called country. Many toll-free numbers are not available from cell phones (usually blocked by the cell phone provider rather than the provider of the toll-free number {{in an effort to}} prevent low-price competition from calling card providers). Some toll-free numbers are not available from phones listed by the owner of the number, including many payphones. For example, the MCI Worldphone calling service blocks usage from <b>the</b> <b>pay</b> <b>phones</b> in international airports (Rio and São Paulo) and many downtown <b>pay</b> <b>phones</b> due to [...] "excessive fraud" [...] from those phones (July 2003). In addition, Brazil has a system of regular and international <b>pay</b> <b>phones</b> (designated with <b>the</b> symbol [...] "DDD").

50|$|Two tapping {{patterns}} {{are used in}} order to distinguish the type of assistance requested: a steady tapping pattern indicates a request for Police assistance, while a repeated two-tap pattern indicates a request for Fire and Emergency Medical Service (“EMS”) response.

For example, in central London the percentage of mobile emergency calls grew from 5 % in 1999 to 29 % in 2004. After implementation of automated location collection, typically referred to as emergency mobile location, the average ambulance vehicle response time dropped from 469 to 444 s [11].|$|R
