5|$|Lumumba's {{appeal for}} Soviet support split the {{government}} and led to mounting pressure from Western countries <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from power. In addition, both Tshombe and Kalonji appealed to Kasa-Vubu, who they believed to be both a moderate and federalist, to move against Lumumba's centralism and resolve the secession issue. Meanwhile, Mobutu took effective control of the army, routing foreign aid and promotions to specific units and officers to secure their allegiance.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{establishment}} of the revolutionary committee, however, a faction opposing Pan emerged and sought <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from power. Pan became involved in factional violence. He jailed people from the rival faction, including party members and ordinary people. His supporters and opponents fought each other in major armed conflicts, and Pan had serious disagreements with the local military leadership. In June 1971, the central government dismissed him from his posts and put him under investigation.|$|E
5|$|The Pros almost scored twice, {{but failed}} once because of ineligible {{receiver}} penalties. On the other hand, Pollard made a touchdown-saving tackle against Sternment {{in the third}} quarter. On the same drive, the Staleys missed a 30-yard field goal. The Staleys' Chamberlin attempted to injure Pollard twice in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from the game. The final score ended in a 0–0 tie; however, the Chicago Defender reported that the refereeing was biased towards Decatur.|$|E

50|$|Christian was {{considered}} one of the best Irish lawyers of his time but as a judge regularly courted controversy. His bitter and sarcastic temper and open contempt for most of his colleagues led to frequent clashes both in Court and in the Press. Though he was rebuked several times by the House of Commons, no serious thought seems to have been given <b>to</b> <b>removing</b> <b>him</b> from office.|$|R

5|$|Ant Island is {{a colony}} of ants led by the Queen and her daughter, Princess Atta. Every season, {{they are forced to}} give food to a gang of marauding {{grasshoppers}} led by Hopper. One day, when Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, inadvertently knocks the offering into a stream with his latest invention, a grain harvesting device, Hopper demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik suggests in earnest that they seek help from other stronger bugs, the other ants see it as an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> and send him off.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge and Minnesota Territory's Henry Mower Rice {{were among}} the speculators who {{invested}} in land near present-day Superior, Wisconsin. Rice disliked Minnesota's territorial governor, Willis A. Gorman, and petitioned Pierce to replace him with Breckinridge. Pierce twice investigated Gorman, but found no grounds <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from office. Breckinridge fell ill when traveling to view his investments in mid-1855 {{and was unable to}} campaign in the state elections. Know Nothings captured every state office and six congressional districts—including the Eighth District—and Breckinridge sent regrets to friends in Washington, D.C., promising to take {{a more active role in}} the 1856 campaigns.|$|E
5|$|During the Red Scare, {{psychology}} professor Harry C. Steinmetz {{was accused of}} being a Communist. San Diego representatives persuaded the California legislature along with Governor Earl Warren to attempt <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from his teaching position. After the State Board of Education was unable to get an answer from Steinmetz about {{whether or not he was}} a Communist, he was dismissed on February 5, 1954. He attempted to be reinstated but never was even after the legislation that had been developed during the Red Scare was later deemed unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|Clark's ruling drew a {{resolution}} of condemnation from the Kentucky General Assembly. He was summoned {{to appear before the}} legislature, but opted to respond to their charges in writing instead. Incensed, the legislature attempted <b>to</b> <b>removed</b> <b>him</b> from office, but the vote of 5935 fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. In October 1823, Clark's decision was upheld by the Kentucky Court of Appeals; that decision touched off the Old Court-New Court controversy, wherein the legislature attempted to abolish the Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} more sympathetic court.|$|R
50|$|On October 13, 2009, Burns was optioned <b>to</b> Triple-A Nashville, <b>removing</b> <b>him</b> {{from the}} Brewers 40-man roster. He was {{released}} on March 31, 2010.|$|R
50|$|On November 5, 2010, Marte was outrighted <b>to</b> Triple-A Columbus, <b>removing</b> <b>him</b> {{from the}} 40-man roster, thus making him {{eligible}} {{to become a}} free agent.|$|R
5|$|Forced {{to choose}} between {{accepting}} depreciated money in payment for outstanding debts or waiting long times to collect debts, creditors turned to the courts for relief. In 1822, Bourbon County circuit court judge James Clark ruled {{in the case of}} Williams v. Blair that the replevin law violated the state and federal constitutions. This ruling was so unpopular with the Relief Party that they attempted <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from office, but the 5935 vote fell just short of the needed two-thirds majority. Fayette County circuit court judge Francis P. Blair issued a similar ruling in the case of Lapsley v. Brashear.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 Fleming {{enrolled}} at Eton College. Although not a high achiever academically, he excelled at athletics {{and held the}} title of Victor Ludorum ("Winner of the Games") for two years between 1925 and 1927. He also edited a school magazine, The Wyvern. His lifestyle at Eton brought him into conflict with his housemaster, E. V. Slater, who disapproved of Fleming's attitude, his hair oil, his ownership of a car and his relations with women. Slater persuaded Fleming's mother <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from Eton a term early for a crammer course to gain entry to the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. He spent {{less than a year}} there, leaving in 1927 without gaining a commission, after contracting gonorrhea.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the ACLU {{board of}} {{directors}} asked executive director Baldwin to resign, feeling that he lacked the organizational skills to lead the 9,000 (and growing) member organization. Baldwin objected, but {{a majority of the}} board elected <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from the position, and he was replaced by Patrick Murphy Malin. Under Malin's guidance, membership tripled to 30,000 by 1955the start of a 24-year period of continual growth leading to 275,000 members in 1974. Malin also presided over an expansion of local ACLU affiliates.|$|E
50|$|A train engineer, 36-year-old Marcello Raneri, {{was trapped}} in the crushed cabin. When the rescuers arrived the scene, he shouted and called for help but could not be recovered.

5000|$|There {{has been}} {{controversy}} over Ashraf's influence on appointments and dismissals at the university, and over alleged financial irregularities. [...] A three membered committee {{formed by the}} Higher Education Commission (HEC) [...] "unearthed gross administrative and financial irregularities" [...] and recommended the President of Pakistan <b>to</b> immediately <b>remove</b> <b>him.</b> The decision was still pending in February 2017.|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{suspension}} of the Liberian Constitution {{as a result of}} a military coup in April 1980, Gbalazeh was appointed Chief Justice of the newly formed People's Supreme Court by the ruling People's Redemption Council. Gbalazeh swore in the newly elected President Samuel Doe on 6 January 1986 and stepped down on 15 January during the transition from military to civilian rule. [...] Gbalazeh became the focus of a nationwide controversy after revoking the law license of Jenkins K.Z.B. Scott. Because Scott was at that point the Minister of Justice, the Head of State Samuel Doe ordered the Chief Justice to reverse himself, claiming that debarring the Minister of Justice amounted <b>to</b> <b>removing</b> <b>him</b> from office and that only the Head of State might remove government ministers.|$|R
5|$|In {{the absence}} of the King or {{government}} in occupied Belgium, Mercier became the predominant figure in the country and a symbol of resilience. Because of his status, he could not be arrested without an outcry and, although lured back to the Vatican in 1915 <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from the country, he soon returned. His writings were banned, however, and copies of their work confiscated. In 1916, Mercier was officially prohibited from publishing pamphlets but continued to campaign against the deportation of workers and various other German policies. Initially opposed by Pope Benedict XV, who was anxious to remain neutral, the Pope was supportive of the Belgian church but encouraged it to moderate its stance to avoid confrontation.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} month leading up the coup, Khánh's leadership had become increasingly troubled. He {{had tried to}} augment his powers by declaring a state of emergency, but this only provoked large-scale protests and riots calling {{for an end to}} military rule, with Buddhist activists at the forefront. Fearful of losing power, Khánh began making concessions to the protesters and promised democracy in the near future. He also removed several military officials closely linked to the discriminatory Catholic rule of the slain former President Ngô Đình Diệm; this response to Buddhist pressure dismayed several Catholic officers, who made a few abortive moves <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from power.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Enterprise {{is fired}} upon by a cloaked attacker, with each {{subsequent}} attack {{stronger than the}} last, straining the ship's shields. Chief Engineer Lt. Logan (Vyto Ruginis) goes to the bridge to demand that the Enterprise flee the planet and attempts to take command, as he outranks La Forge, but La Forge refuses, pointing out that Logan lacks the authority <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>him,</b> and orders {{him to return to}} Engineering. As the attacks continue, La Forge recalls Logan to the bridge and orders a saucer separation, leaving Logan in charge of the saucer, and taking command of the star-drive section from the battle bridge himself to return to Minos.|$|E

5|$|There were {{calls for}} Diefenbaker's retirement, {{especially}} from the Bay Street {{wing of the party}} as early as 1964. Diefenbaker initially beat back attempts <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> without trouble. When Pearson called an election in 1965 in the expectation of receiving a majority, Diefenbaker ran an aggressive campaign. The Liberals fell two seats short of a majority, and the Tories improved their position slightly {{at the expense of the}} smaller parties. After the election, some Tories, led by party president Dalton Camp, began a quiet campaign to oust Diefenbaker.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in April 1934, and at Hitler's request, Heydrich and Himmler began {{building}} a dossier on Sturmabteilung (SA) leader Ernst Röhm {{in an effort}} <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> as a rival for party leadership. At this point, the SS was still part of the SA, the early Nazi paramilitary organisation which now numbered over 3 million men. At Hitler's direction, Heydrich, Himmler, Göring, and Viktor Lutze drew up lists of those who should be liquidated, starting with seven top SA officials and including many more. On 30 June 1934 the SS and Gestapo acted in coordinated mass arrests that continued for two days. Röhm was shot without trial, along with {{the leadership of the}} SA. The purge became known as the Night of the Long Knives. Up to 200 people were killed in the action. Lutze was appointed SA's new head and it was converted into a sports and training organisation.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{accepted}} {{an appointment to}} the circuit court of Bourbon and Clark counties in 1817. It was in this capacity that the most defining event of his career occurred. In 1822, he struck down a debt relief law {{in the case of}} Williams v. Blair on the basis that it impeded the obligation of contracts. His decision was unpopular with the legislature, who condemned the ruling and summoned Clark to appear before them and defend it. An attempt by the legislature <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from office fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. The following year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark's ruling. In retaliation, the legislature attempted to abolish the court and create a new one more sympathetic to their views. This event and its aftermath became known as the Old Court-New Court controversy.|$|E

50|$|During his overthrow, Pedro I {{managed to}} seek asylum {{in one of}} the churches of M'banza-Kongo. King Diogo I was {{reluctant}} <b>to</b> attempt <b>removing</b> <b>him,</b> allowing Pedro <b>to</b> plot Diogo's overthrow from within the church. The details of his plot are well known because Diogo launched an inquest into them in 1550. A copy of the inquest has survived in the Portuguese archives and was published in 1877 by Paiva Manso.|$|R
50|$|Having {{acquired}} Portuguese citizenship, Abubakar {{chose to}} represent that country. On 16 June 2016, {{he was selected}} for a 23-man preliminary list for the 2016 UEFA European Under-19 Championship and also made the final squad, scoring in a 4-3 group stage win over the hosts Germany. Shortly after, however, after doubts arose regarding his eligibilty, the Portuguese Football Federation opted <b>to</b> immediately <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from the competition pending further approval.|$|R
5|$|Following {{months of}} Euromaidan street protests that began {{because of his}} refusal to sign an Association Agreement with the European Union in favor of deals from Russia, President Yanukovych fled Kiev in February 2014, {{ultimately}} to Russia, and parliament voted <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from his post. This brought another change in direction of Ukraine's association with Europe and by extension NATO. In 2014, pro-Russian unrest occurred in eastern Ukraine and Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation in March. As {{part of an effort}} to assuage concerned groups, newly installed Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk addressed the topic in a Russian language speech on 18 March 2014, emphasizing that Ukraine was not seeking NATO membership. US President Barack Obama echoed this position the following week, while calling for greater NATO presence in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1897, Clark {{attempted}} to secure protection for his holdings from the British South Africa Company. The Company took little notice of him. A local chief, Chintanda, {{complained to the}} Company in 1899 that Clark had secured his concessions while passing himself off as a Company official and had been collecting hut tax {{for at least two}} years under this pretence. The Company resolved <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from power, and did so in 1902. Clark then farmed for about two decades, with some success, and moved in the late 1910s to Broken Hill. There he became a prominent local figure, and a partner in the first licensed brewery in Northern Rhodesia. Remaining in Broken Hill for the rest of his life, he died there in 1927.|$|E
5|$|With hostility towards reform growing, {{the poor}} results, and Kosygin's reformist stance, {{led to a}} popular {{backlash}} against him. Kosygin lost most of the privileges he had enjoyed before the reform, but Brezhnev was never able <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> {{from the office of}} Chairman of the Council of Ministers, despite his weakened position. In the aftermath of his failed reform, Kosygin spent {{the rest of his life}} improving the economic administration through the modification of targets; he implemented various programmes to improve food security and ensure the future intensification of production. There is no proof to back up the claim that the reform itself contributed to the high growth seen in the late-1960s, and that its cancellation had anything to do with the stagnating growth of the economy which began in the 1970s.|$|E
