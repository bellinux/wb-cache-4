40|$|The Triangle Orientation Discrimination (<b>TOD)</b> <b>test</b> {{method was}} applied to {{characterize}} thermal and visual range performance of the Gatekeeper Electro Optical Security System. Gatekeeper developed by Thales Nederland BV, is currently in use with the Royal Netherlands Navy. The system houses uncooled infrared and colour TV cameras providing up to 360 Â° view in azimuth. The images displayed to the operator are automatically optimized based on the scene intensity distribution. Because of this built-in scene-based optimization, proper measurement of the system requires careful surround illumination of the TOD setup over {{a large part of}} the camera Field Of View. The tests provided very accurate threshold estimates with relatively small observer differences. The resulting TOD curves that characterize the sensor system in terms of acuity and contrast sensitivity can be used as input to a Target Acquisition model to predict range performance for operational scenarios...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} simple and {{powerful}} method to assess the quality of imaging systems with a human-in-the-loop: the triangle orientation discrimination or TOD method. Basically, a human observer judges the orientation of equilateral triangle test patterns of various degrees of difficulty using the sensor system under test. The sensor system degrades {{the image of the}} test pattern, and the method evaluates the combined effect of all image transformations within the sensor system including the observer. The results are shown to have a close relationship to real object recognition performance. The method has a wide application area and is suitable to characterize sensors from different spectral ranges (eg visual, infrared, X-ray), image enhancement techniques and image artifacts (eg due to compression). In addition to the <b>TOD</b> <b>test</b> method, we propose a vision model that simulates the human observer performing the TOD task. Here we will describe the method, its advantages over existing methods, the validation, the model, and some applications...|$|E
40|$|The MRTD and MRC {{end-to-end}} EO/IR {{system tests}} and corresponding models, described in NATO STANAGs 4347 - 4351, lead to incorrect Target Acquisition (TA) range predictions for modern imaging {{systems that are}} 1) usually under-sampled and/or 2) contain complex signal processing. Considerable efforts {{have been made to}} develop tests and models that can cope with these highly non-linear properties. This has led to new candidates for inclusion in the standards: the TTP (Targeting Task Performance) range prediction metric (US), the TOD (Triangle Orientation Discrimination) test method (NL), and the MTDP test with the TRM 4 model (GE). In the present study, we directly compare TOD, TTP and US tactical vehicle identification performance data for a variety of sensors. The data show that the <b>TOD</b> <b>test</b> pattern is a good representative of the US tactical vehicle set and that the two approaches can be integrated into a single methodology for modelling and testin...|$|E
40|$|End-to-end Electro-Optical system {{performance}} <b>tests</b> such as <b>TOD,</b> MRTD and MTDP require {{the effort of}} several trained human observers, each performing a series of visual judgments on the displayed output of the system. This significantly contributes to the costs of sensor testing. Currently, several synthetic human observer models exist that can replace real human observers in the <b>TOD</b> sensor performance <b>test</b> {{and can be used}} in a TOD based Target Acquisition (TA) model. The reliability that may be expected with such a model is of key importance. In order to systematically test HVS (Human Vision System) models for automated <b>TOD</b> sensor performance <b>testing,</b> two general sets of human observer TOD threshold data were collected. The first set contains TOD data for the unaided human eye. The second set was collected on imagery processed with sensor effects, systematically varying primary sensor parameters such as diffraction blur, pixel pitch, and spatial noise. The set can easily be extended to other sensor effects including dynamic noise, boost, E-zoom, or fused sensor imagery and may serve as a benchmark for competing human vision and sensor performance models...|$|R
40|$|Individuals {{diagnosed}} with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) exhibit patterns of cognitive deficits in (1) attention (Lees-Roitman, Cornblatt, Bergman, Obuchowski, Mitropoulou, Keefe, Silverman, & Siever, 1997), (2) memory (Bergman, Harvey, Lees-Roitman, Mohs, Margerm, Silverman, & Siever, 1998), (3) executive functioning (Cadenhead, Perry, Shafer, & Braff, 1999), and recently (4) neuromotor functioning (Neumann & Walker, 1999), similar to {{individuals with a}} diagnosis of schizophrenia. Furthermore, recent research suggests a link between neuromotor and cognitive functioning in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) (Neumann & Walker, 2003). The current study {{is an extension of}} research on non-drug-induced neuromotor disturbances in individuals with SPD and examines how such disturbances covary with neurocognitive measures. Approximately thirty-three adults (18 - 65) were rated for SPD symptoms. Motor assessments included a computerized motor task and finger tapping test. Cognitive assessments included measures of attention, verbal and visual memory, and executive functioning. Consistent with previous research, the SPD group displayed significant right hand (left hemisphere) motor disturbances (i. e., increased force and force variability) compared to healthy controls after excluding all cases reporting a history of head injury. In addition, results indicate significant associations between motor, cognitive, and symptom variables. Consistent with previous research, neuromotor functioning and the relationships between motor and cognitive functioning varied as a function of Time of Day (<b>TOD)</b> of <b>testing.</b> Understanding the relationship between neuromotor and neurocognitive functioning may help elucidate the neural systems that contribute the symptoms characteristic of SSDs...|$|R
40|$|The cosmic {{microwave}} background (CMB) temperature and polarisation anisotropies contain a wealth of cosmological information concerning the formation and evolution of the universe. Upcoming CMB experiments targeting measurements of the B-mode polarisation pattern of the CMB face a major challenge {{both in terms of}} experimental design and data analysis due to the small amplitude of the signal and the presence of experimental systematic effects and polarised foregrounds. This thesis focuses on aspects of preparation for the Spider experiment. Spider is a balloon-borne polarimeter targeting CMB polarisation, it will launch in the Austral summer of 2013 for a long duration flight from Antarctica. It consists of large arrays of 512 detectors in each receiver, creating a large volume of data that is a challenge to analyse, especially when taking into account noise correlations between detectors. We develop SPIMPI, a mapmaking algorithm for estimating temperature and polarisation maps from Time Ordered Data (<b>TOD).</b> To <b>test</b> the mapmaker, realistic TOD containing signal and noise components are generated from the simulated Spider scan strategy. We use an iterative scheme for solving linear systems (the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method) to produce optimal estimates of temperature and polarisation. We present templates of the intensity and polarisation of emission from two of the main polarised Galactic foregrounds, interstellar dust and synchrotron radiation. We present estimates of the level of polarised foregrounds expected, focusing on high galactic latitudes and patches that will be targeted by upcoming experiments. We describe details of a model for the 3 D Galactic magnetic field, examining both large and small scales. We include details of the dust and cosmic ray electron density distributions, grain alignment, the intrinsic polarisation of the emission from an individual grain and details of synchrotron emission mechanisms. We compare the templates with WMAP MCMC best-fit templates for these foreground components. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Video of Visual Acuity (VA) and Contrast Sensitivity (CS) test {{charts in}} a complex {{background}} was recorded using a CCD camera mounted on a computer-controlled tripod and fed into real-time MPEG 2 compression/decompression equipment. The test charts {{were based on the}} Triangle Orientation Discrimination (<b>TOD)</b> <b>test</b> method and contained triangle test patterns of different sizes and contrasts in four possible orientations. In a perception experiment, VA and CS thresholds at the 75 % correct level were obtained for three camera velocities (0, 1. 0 and 2. 0 deg/s or 0, 4. 1 and 8. 1 pix/frame) and four compression rates (no compression, 4 Mb/s, 2 Mb/s and 1 Mb/s). VA is shown to be rather robust to any combination of motion and compression. CS however dramatically decreases when motion is combined with high compression ratios. The data suggest that with the MPEG 2 algorithm the emphasis is on the preservation of image detail at the cost of contrast loss.

40|$|Night vision {{equipment}} {{is crucial in}} order to accomplish supremacy and safety of the troops on the battlefield. Evidently, system integrators, ministry of defenses and end-users need access to reliable quantitative characterization of the expected field performance when using night vision equipment. The image intensifier tube {{is one of the most}} important engines driving the performance for night vision equipment. As a major tube manufacturer, Photonis investigates the link between its products physical design parameters and the actual end-user field performance. The developments include (1) an end-to-end performance measurement method and test facility, (2) an image-based night vision simulation, and (3) a range estimation model. The purpose is twofold: (1) being able to support the need of the integrators and end-users and (2) further systematic improvement of night vision equipment design. For the end-to-end test, Photonis and TNO cooperated in the implementation of the triangle orientation discrimination (<b>TOD)</b> <b>test</b> for night vision equipment. This test provides a clear and rigorous ranking of the products with respect to their target acquisition performance level. We present the Photonis night vision test laboratory, provide TOD results for a set of night vision devices, and show range prediction examples...|$|E
40|$|Video {{of visual}} acuity (VA) and {{contrast}} sensitivity (CS) test charts {{in a complex}} background was recorded using a CCD color camera mounted on a computer-controlled tripod and was fed into real-time MPEG- 2 compression/decompression equipment. The test charts {{were based on the}} triangle orientation discrimination (<b>TOD)</b> <b>test</b> method and contained triangle test patterns of different sizes and contrasts in four possible orientations. In a perception experiment, observers judged the orientation of the triangles in order to determine VA and CS thresholds at the 75 % correct level. Three camera velocities (0, 1. 0, and 2. 0 deg/s, or 0, 4. 1, and 8. 1 pixels/frame) and four compression rates (no compression, 4 Mb/s, 2 Mb/s, and 1 Mb/s) were used. VA is shown to be rather robust to any combination of motion and compression. CS, however, dramatically decreases when motion is combined with high compression ratios. The measured thresholds were fed into the TOD target acquisition model to predict the effect of motion and compression on acquisition ranges for tactical military vehicles. The effect of compression on static performance is limited but strong with motion video. The data suggest that with the MPEG 2 algorithm, the emphasis is on the preservation of image detail at the cost of contrast loss...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that the optimal time of day (TOD) for cognitive function for young adults occurs in the afternoon and evening times (Allen, et al. 2008; May, et al. 1993). The implication is college students may be more successful if they schedule classes and tests in the afternoon and evening times, but in asynchronous learning environments, âclassâ and tests take place at any TOD (or night) a student might choose. The problem is {{that there may be a}} disadvantage for students choosing to take <b>tests</b> at certain <b>TOD.</b> As educators, we need to be aware of potential barriers to student success and be prepared to offer guidance to students. This research study found a significant negative correlation between TOD and assessment scores on tests taken between 16 : 01 and 22 : 00 hours as measured in military time. While this study shows that academic performance on asynchronous assessments was high at 16 : 00 hours, student performance diminished significantly by 22 : 00 hours. When efforts were taken to mitigate the extraneous variables related to test complexity and individual academic achievement, the effect TOD had on assessment achievement during this time period was comparable to the effect of test complexity on that achievement. However, when analyzed using a small sub-set of the data neither GPA nor TOD could be used to predict student scores on tests taken between 16 : 01 and 22 : 00 hours. Finally, individual circadian arousal types (evening, morning and neutral) (Horne 2 Ì 6 Ostberg, 1976) and actual <b>TOD</b> students took <b>tests</b> were analyzed to determine if synchrony, the match between circadian arousal type and peak cognitive performance, existed. The synchrony effect could not be confirmed among morning type students taking this asynchronous online course, but evidence suggests that synchrony could have contributed to student success for evening types taking this asynchronous online courses. The implication of this study is that online instructors, instructional designers and students should consider TOD as a factor affecting achievement in asynchronous online courses. Results of this research are intended to propose further research into TOD effects in asynchronous online settings, and to offer guidance to online students as well as online instructors and instructional designers faced with setting deadlines and advising students on how to be successful when learning online...|$|R
40|$|Moving imagery from {{a static}} scene was {{recorded}} with an un-cooled thermal imager at nine different angular velocities ranging from 0 (static) to 1 pixel/frame (3. 75 deg/s) using a tilted rotating mirror. The scene contained a thermal acuity test chart with triangular test patterns {{based on the}} Triangle Orientation Discrimination (<b>TOD)</b> <b>test</b> method. The imagery was processed with different types of image enhancement: DSR (Dynamic Super Resolution), LACE (Local Adaptive Contrast Enhancement) and combinations. DSR shows a significant performance improvement at low velocities, a moderate improvement at medium velocities where smear becomes apparent and no benefit at high speed. Performance with LACE is close to optimized gain and level setting by hand. Static performance and dynamic performance at 0. 57 pixel/frame containing significant smear were compared with earlier published identification performance data for twohand held systems collected {{under a variety of}} signal processing conditions. It shows that the ratio M 75 between the 75 % correct threshold size for the two-hand held objects and the TOD triangle is preserved under all conditions measured. Thus, TA range prediction based on the TOD is robust against a complex combination of conditions, including motion, smear and the types of image enhancement applied.

40|$|The Triangle Orientation Discrimination (TOD) {{methodology}} includes i) {{a widely}} applicable, accurate end-to-end EO/IR sensor test, ii) an image-based sensor system model and iii) a Target Acquisition (TA) range model. The method {{has been extensively}} validated against TA field performance {{for a wide variety}} of well- and under-sampled imagers, systems with advanced image processing techniques such as dynamic super resolution and local adaptive contrast enhancement, and sensors showing smear or noise drift, for both static and dynamic test stimuli and as a function of target contrast. Recently, significant progress has been made in various directions. Dedicated visual and NIR test charts for lab and field testing are available and thermal test benches are on the market. Automated sensor testing using an objective synthetic human observer is within reach. Both an analytical and an image-based TOD model have recently been developed and are being implemented in the European Target Acquisition model ECOMOS and in the EOSTAR TDA. Further, the methodology is being applied for design optimization of high-end security camera systems. Finally, results from a recent perception study suggest that DRI ranges for real targets can be predicted by replacing the relevant distinctive target features by <b>TOD</b> <b>test</b> patterns of the same characteristic size and contrast, enabling a new TA modeling approach.

40|$|The TTP (Targeting Task Performance) metric, {{developed}} at NVESD, {{is the current}} standard US Army model to predict EO/IR Target Acquisition performance. This model however {{does not have a}} corresponding lab or field test to empirically assess the performance of a camera system. The TOD (Triangle Orientation Discrimination) method, {{developed at}} TNO in The Netherlands, provides such a measurement. In this study, we make a direct comparison between TOD performance for a range of sensors and the extensive historical US observer performance database built to develop and calibrate the TTP metric. The US perception data were collected doing an identification task by military personnel on a standard 12 target, 12 aspect tactical vehicle image set that was processed through simulated sensors for which the most fundamental sensor parameters such as blur, sampling, spatial and temporal noise were varied. In the present study, we measured TOD sensor performance using exactly the same sensors processing a set of TOD triangle test patterns. The study shows that good overall agreement is obtained when the ratio between target characteristic size and <b>TOD</b> <b>test</b> pattern size at threshold equals 6. 3. Note that this number is purely based on empirical data without any intermediate modeling. The calibration of the TOD to the TTP is highly beneficial to the sensor modeling and testing community for a variety of reasons. These include: i) a connection between requirement specification and acceptance testing, and ii) a very efficient method to quickly validate or extend the TTP range prediction model to new systems and tasks.
