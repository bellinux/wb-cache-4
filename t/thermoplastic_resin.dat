25|$|B-72 is a <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>resin</b> {{that was}} created by Rohm and Haas {{for use as a}} surface coating and as a vehicle for Flexographic ink. However B-72 is now being used more as an {{adhesive}} specifically for ceramic and glass. One of the major advantages of B-72 as a consolidate is that it is stronger and harder than polyvinyl acetate without being extremely brittle. This adhesive is more flexible than many of the other typically-used adhesives and tolerates stress and strain on a join that most others can not. One major drawback to using B-72 is the difficulty of applying the acrylic resin as an adhesive, as is difficulty in manipulating the substance as a workable agent. The most suitable solvent for B-72 is acetone.|$|E
