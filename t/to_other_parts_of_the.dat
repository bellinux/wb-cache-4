5|$|Brachytherapy can be {{used with}} the aim of curing the cancer in cases of small or locally {{advanced}} tumours, provided the cancer has not metastasized (spread <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body). In appropriately selected cases, brachytherapy for primary tumours often represents a comparable approach to surgery, achieving the same probability of cure and with similar side effects.|$|E
5|$|During {{the colonial}} period, present-day Argentina offered fewer {{economic}} advantages compared <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Empire such as Mexico or Peru, which {{caused it to}} assume a peripheral position within the Spanish colonial economy. It lacked deposits of gold or other precious metals, nor did it have established native civilizations to subject to the encomienda.|$|E

5|$|A general {{hospital}} {{is located in}} {{the eastern side of the}} city. Modern health care facilities exist only in Bangui but are poor, providing only minimal care. Wealthier citizens make use of private clinics. The risk of catching HIV in the city is reportedly high, and many truck drivers stopping in the city for sexual services pose a major risk of spreading the disease <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country. The risk of catching malaria in Bangui and pygmy camps is also much higher than in the rest of the country.|$|E

5|$|A soccer kick is {{performed}} when a fighter is standing {{to the side}} or {{in front of an}} opponent on the ground and kicks the grounded opponent's head. This is done in a style similar to an association football player kicking a football. Most practitioners aim to use their shins for the point of impact rather than the foot. While soccer kicks are usually delivered to the head, kicks <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body in a similar style are also referred to as soccer kicks.|$|E
5|$|American {{black bears}} were a common {{attraction}} by the 1930s, but in 1929 alone 81people required treatment for bear-related injuries. Troublesome bears were marked with white paint before being relocated <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park, and repeat offenders were killed. Bear feeding shows were stopped in 1940, but the Park Service continued to kill bears that habitually raided camps; 200 were put down between 1960 and 1972. Park visitors are now educated about proper food storage.|$|E
5|$|Despite closer {{co-operation}} {{and improvements}} {{made to the}} Bakerloo stations and <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network, the Underground railways continued to struggle financially. The UERL's ownership of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group, through the pooling of revenue, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways. However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had {{a negative impact on}} the profitability of the whole UERL group.|$|E

5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (the lining of the uterus or womb). It {{is the result of}} the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain.

Of the 146Party secretaries of cities and districts outside Moscow city in the province, only 10 survived the purges. In his memoirs, Khrushchev noted that almost everyone {{who worked with him}} was arrested. By Party protocol, Khrushchev was required to approve these arrests, and did little or nothing to save his friends and colleagues.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the key}} {{contributors}} to globalization was the Triangular Trade and how it connected the world. The Triangular Trade or Triangle Trade was a system used to connect three {{areas of the world}} through trade.

The Triangle Trade system was run by Europeans, increasing their global power.|$|E
