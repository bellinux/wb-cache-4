5|$|As {{with other}} welding {{processes}} such as gas metal arc welding, shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E
5|$|These {{processes}} use a welding {{power supply}} to create and maintain an electric arc between an electrode and the base material to melt metals at <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> point. They can use either direct (DC) or alternating (AC) current, and consumable or non-consumable electrodes. <b>The</b> <b>welding</b> region is sometimes protected by some type of inert or semi-inert gas, known as a shielding gas, and filler material is sometimes used as well.|$|E
5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} step-down transformer and for direct current models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> machine is high-voltage alternating current, <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of turns in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Hat cracks {{get their}} {{name from the}} shape of the {{cross-section}} of <b>the</b> <b>weld,</b> because <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> flares out at the face of <b>the</b> <b>weld.</b> <b>The</b> crack starts at the fusion line and extends up through <b>the</b> <b>weld.</b> They are usually caused by too much voltage or not enough speed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Detecting <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> {{position}} is <b>the</b> precondition of seam tracking during an arc welding process, and {{is crucial to}} achieve high-quality welds. Visual sensing {{is one of the}} most attractive approaches to detect <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> position, which provides valuable information to control the arc following the expected path. <b>The</b> <b>weld</b> edge is main characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> position image, here the visual technique for detecting <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> position based on Hough transformation is proposed. <b>The</b> <b>weld</b> position can be detected and recognized through Hough transformation, while <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> edge image is detected using the Canny operators. And Hough transformation is modified based on <b>the</b> actual <b>weld</b> situation. Therefore, <b>the</b> precision of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> detection can be improved.

40|$|Tensile {{properties}} and microhardness of electron beam welded thick damage-tolerant Ti- 6 Al- 4 V joints with <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> cross-section of parallel shaped and taper shaped configurations were examined.

The {{results indicate that}} for both the shaped joints, <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> metal exhibits increased strength and microhardness, while decreased ductility and toughness {{as compared with the}} base metal. The mechanical properties of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> metal are heterogeneous along <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> depth.

5|$|However, when Collins {{returned}} to the ASC facility in April 2001 for a year-long maintenance docking, multiple welding defects {{were found in the}} bow and escape tower sections of the submarine (the two sections constructed by Kockums), while almost no problems were found in <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> of the four Australian-built sections.

5|$|Shielding gases are {{necessary}} for {{gas metal arc welding}} to protect <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they come in contact with the electrode, the arc, or <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> metal. This problem is common to all arc welding processes; for example, in the older Shielded-Metal Arc Welding process (SMAW), the electrode is coated with a solid flux which evolves a protective cloud of carbon dioxide when melted by the arc. In GMAW, however, the electrode wire does not have a flux coating, and a separate shielding gas is employed to protect the weld. This eliminates slag, the hard residue from the flux that builds up after welding and must be chipped off to reveal the completed weld.|$|E

5|$|The actual welding {{technique}} utilized {{depends on the}} electrode, {{the composition of the}} workpiece, and the position of the joint being welded. The choice of electrode and welding position also determine <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> speed. Flat welds require the least operator skill, and can be done with electrodes that melt quickly but solidify slowly. This permits higher welding speeds.|$|E
5|$|To {{identify}} different electrodes, the American Welding Society {{established a}} system that assigns electrodes with a four- or five-digit number. Covered electrodes made of mild or low alloy steel carry the prefix E, followed by their number. The first two or three digits of the number specify the tensile strength of the weld metal, in thousand {{pounds per square inch}} (ksi). The penultimate digit generally identifies <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> positions permissible with the electrode, typically using the values 1 (normally fast-freeze electrodes, implying all position welding) and 2 (normally fast-fill electrodes, implying horizontal welding only). <b>The</b> <b>welding</b> current and type of electrode covering are specified by the last two digits together. When applicable, a suffix is used to denote the alloying element being contributed by the electrode.|$|E
5|$|While the {{aerospace}} industry {{is one of the}} primary users of gas tungsten arc welding, the process is used {{in a number of other}} areas. Many industries use GTAW for welding thin workpieces, especially nonferrous metals. It is used extensively in the manufacture of space vehicles, and is also frequently employed to weld small-diameter, thin-wall tubing such as those used in the bicycle industry. In addition, GTAW is often used to make root or first-pass welds for piping of various sizes. In maintenance and repair work, the process is commonly used to repair tools and dies, especially components made of aluminum and magnesium. Because the weld metal is not transferred directly across the electric arc like most open arc welding processes, a vast assortment of welding filler metal is available to <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> engineer. In fact, no other welding process permits <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> of so many alloys in so many product configurations. Filler metal alloys, such as elemental aluminum and chromium, can be lost through the electric arc from volatilization. This loss does not occur with the GTAW process. Because the resulting welds have the same chemical integrity as the original base metal or match the base metals more closely, GTAW welds are highly resistant to corrosion and cracking over long time periods, making GTAW <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> procedure of choice for critical operations like sealing spent nuclear fuel canisters before burial.|$|E
50|$|There are 5 {{pieces to}} each Fillet <b>weld</b> known as <b>the</b> Root, Toe, Face, Leg and Throat. The root of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> is <b>the</b> part of deepest {{penetration}} {{which is the}} opposite angle of the Hypotenuse. The toes of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> are essentially <b>the</b> edges or the points of the hypotenuse.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{formability}} of aluminum– 3 % magnesium laser-welded blanks {{manufactured by}} 3 kW YAG laser welding process is investigated in this paper. Previous experimental {{results showed that}} shear failure occurs in <b>the</b> <b>welds</b> of these blanks during tensile testing with <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> line perpendicular to the tensile axis. In order to further understand the failure in these blanks under uniaxial and biaxial straining conditions, finite element computations under generalized plane strain conditions are conducted to understand <b>the</b> effects of <b>weld</b> geometry and strength on the shear failure. The {{results indicate that the}} average plastic stress–strain behavior of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> should be softer than that in the base metal in the direction perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> line. <b>The</b> results also show that <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> geometry has significant effects on strain localization in <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> under <b>the</b> tensile loading perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> line. <b>The</b> stress–strain histories of the material elements of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> metal in tensile specimens obtained from the finite element computation are used for a failure/ localization analysis.

5|$|Along {{with the}} wire electrode, a {{shielding}} gas feeds through <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> gun, which shields the process from contaminants in the air. The {{process can be}} semi-automatic or automatic. A constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current systems, as well as alternating current, can be used. There are four primary methods of metal transfer in GMAW, called globular, short-circuiting, spray, and pulsed-spray, {{each of which has}} distinct properties and corresponding advantages and limitations.|$|E
5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only {{a limited amount of}} heat is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, such as <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic welding, high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|E
5|$|Filler metals {{are also}} used in nearly all {{applications}} of GTAW, the major exception being <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> of thin materials. Filler metals are available with different diameters and are made {{of a variety of}} materials.

40|$|The {{superstructures}} {{developed in}} <b>the</b> <b>welds</b> between injection molded plates made from alpha-nucleated and non-nucleated isotactic polypropylene (iPP) {{were analyzed by}} infrared (IR) microscopy, polarized light microscopy (PLM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

Deformation of spherulites occurred in <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> seams due to the sheared melt flow. The orientation of the polymer chains in <b>the</b> <b>welds,</b> which is <b>the</b> result of melting and reaystallization, was quantified by IR microscopy for the first time: In the injection molded plates the chains were oriented along machine direction (MD), whereas this pattern changed to normal direction (ND) at <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> seams.

5|$|If {{the amount}} of current used exceeds the {{capability}} of the electrode, tungsten inclusions in the weld may result. Known as tungsten spitting, this can be identified with radiography and can be prevented by changing the type of electrode or increasing the electrode diameter. In addition, if the electrode is not well protected by the gas shield or the operator accidentally allows it to contact the molten metal, it can become dirty or contaminated. This often causes <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> arc to become unstable, requiring that the electrode be ground with a diamond abrasive to remove the impurity.|$|E
5|$|Many welding {{processes}} {{require the use}} of a particular joint design; for example, resistance spot welding, laser beam welding, and electron beam welding are most frequently performed on lap joints. Other welding methods, like shielded metal arc welding, are extremely versatile and can weld virtually any type of joint. Some processes {{can also be used to}} make multipass welds, in which one weld is allowed to cool, and then another weld is performed on top of it. This allows for <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> of thick sections arranged in a single-V preparation joint, for example.|$|E
5|$|On March 8, 2013, the {{engineering}} firm NORR, {{commissioned by the}} Ontario Provincial Police, released {{the results of their}} forensic engineering investigation to the Elliot Lake Inquiry. The investigation found that the collapse was caused by a two-stage failure of <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> on a connection, due to extensive corrosion. The corrosion was caused by improper waterproofing and the placement of a parking lot on the roof, which allowed water, contaminated with road salt (which accelerated the corrosion) to corrode the structure.|$|E
40|$|Non-destructive {{classical}} techniques, such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) {{and open}} circuit potential (OCP) measurement, were complemented with advanced techniques, including the scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET) and localised electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (LEIS) to examine galvanic effects at welds on carbon steel. The classical techniques indicated that corrosion processes are accelerated in <b>the</b> <b>weld.</b> <b>The</b> advanced techniques revealed admittance values related to more severe corrosion along <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> than in <b>the</b> base metal and higher corrosion currents in <b>the</b> <b>weld.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> and base metal are electrically connected, <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> {{serves as a}} cathodic protector for the base metal...|$|R
5|$|Welders often {{develop a}} {{technique}} of rapidly alternating between moving the torch forward (to advance <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> pool) and adding filler metal. The filler rod is withdrawn from <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> pool {{each time the}} electrode advances, but it is always kept inside the gas shield to prevent oxidation of its surface and contamination of <b>the</b> <b>weld.</b> Filler rods composed of metals with a low melting temperature, such as aluminum, require that the operator maintain {{some distance from the}} arc while staying inside the gas shield. If held too close to the arc, the filler rod can melt before it makes contact with <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> puddle. As <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> nears completion, <b>the</b> arc current is often gradually reduced to allow <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> crater to solidify and prevent the formation of crater cracks at the end of <b>the</b> <b>weld.</b>|$|R
40|$|Breakdowns of welded {{structures}} are usually {{a consequence of}} fatigue loading. Fatigue fractures are commonly initiated in the region close to <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> toe but can also initiate from <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> root and from discontinuities inside <b>the</b> <b>weld.</b> <b>The</b> purpose {{of this investigation was}} to examine <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> quality of welded joints produced at Volvo Wheel Loaders factory in Arvika. The goal of the investigation is to give a clearer insight regarding factors influencing the fatigue strength of <b>the</b> <b>welded</b> joints and thereby give a better foundation for fatigue strength calculations. The investigation is including examination of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> geometry, <b>weld</b> discontinuities and <b>the</b> effects of shot peening. Mainly three different methods for collecting test data have been used: Plastic replicas cast on <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> profile, weld specimens from a rear frame belonging to a wheel loader of model L 110 E/ 120 E and Almen testing of the shot peening.

5|$|One of {{the most}} common types of arc welding is {{shielded}} metal arc welding (SMAW); it is also known as manual metal arc welding (MMA) or stick welding. Electric current is used to strike an arc between the base material and consumable electrode rod, which is made of filler material (typically steel) and is covered with a flux that protects the weld area from oxidation and contamination by producing carbon dioxide (CO2) gas during <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> process. The electrode core itself acts as filler material, making a separate filler unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|The {{equipment}} is relatively inexpensive and simple, generally employing the combustion of acetylene in oxygen {{to produce a}} welding flame temperature of about 3100°C. The flame, since it is less concentrated than an electric arc, causes slower weld cooling, {{which can lead to}} greater residual stresses and weld distortion, though it eases <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> of high alloy steels. A similar process, generally called oxyfuel cutting, is used to cut metals.|$|E
5|$|The {{process is}} {{versatile}} {{and can be}} performed with relatively inexpensive equipment, making it well suited to shop jobs and field work. An operator can become reasonably proficient with a modest amount of training and can achieve mastery with experience. Weld times are rather slow, since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag, the residue from the flux, must be chipped away after welding. Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials, though special electrodes have made possible <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> of cast iron, nickel, aluminum, copper, and other metals.|$|E
50|$|Another {{potential}} danger is {{the emergence of}} cracks in <b>the</b> <b>weld.</b> If both parts are rigid, the shrinkage of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> produces high stress in <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> which may lead to cracks if the material is brittle (even if only after remelting by <b>welding).</b> <b>The</b> consequences of <b>weld</b> contraction should always be considered when constructing the parts to be welded.|$|R
40|$|In this work, API X- 65 {{pipeline}} steel non-conventionally heat treated, {{to enhance}} its mechanical resistance, was <b>welded</b> using <b>the</b> Metal Inert Gas (MIG) process {{with and without}} the application of low intensity axial magnetic fields (6 mT).

Failure of <b>the</b> <b>welds</b> occurred far from <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> beads. <b>The</b> electromagnetic stirring of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> pool significantly reduced the levels of porosity in <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> beads and favored columnar grain growth due to the ferromagnetic nature of the base metal and filler wire.

40|$|The {{safety factor}} for joints was investigated, {{which is at}} <b>the</b> <b>welded</b> joint of <b>the</b> steel {{structure}} in consideration of Column-Overdesign-Factor (COF).
