5|$|When an Indian American {{passenger}} reveals {{himself as}} an American, one of <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> murders him and throws his body off the aircraft {{in front of the}} Pakistani negotiators. <b>The</b> <b>terrorists</b> try to locate a radio engineer among the passengers by ordering Neerja to make an announcement over the intercom. When Emran Ali (Shashi Bhushan), a Pakistani radio engineer, begins to stand up, Neerja signals for him to sit down. <b>The</b> <b>terrorists</b> have the flight attendants collect all passports to identify the American passengers and hold them hostage; Neerja and her colleagues collect the passports, disposing of any American passports by throwing them down trash chutes or hiding them under seats. Dejected over not finding any American passports, the hijackers locate a British passenger and hold him hostage.|$|E

40|$|I nthis paperwe study a two-period {{game between}} a {{government}} and a <b>terrorist,</b> where <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> decides whether to stockpile attack resources from the first to the second period. Our results show that <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> chooses stockpiling when: (a) the following parameters are in intermediate ranges: the government’s asset valuation, <b>the</b> <b>terrorist’s</b> first-period resource, <b>the</b> govern-ment’s unit defense cost, and <b>the</b> <b>terrorist’s</b> unit attack cost; (b) <b>the</b> <b>terrorist’s</b> second-period resource is small; and (c) <b>the</b> <b>terrorist’s</b> resource growth factor or discount factor is large.

40|$|We analyze how a {{government}} allocates its resources between attacking to downgrade a terrorist’s resources and defending against a <b>terrorist</b> attack. Analogously, <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> allocates its resources between attacking {{a government}}’s asset and defending its own resources. A two-stage game is considered {{where the government}} moves first and <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> moves second. We show that (a) when <b>the</b> <b>terrorist’s</b> resources are low, the government attacks <b>the</b> <b>terrorist’s</b> resources sufficiently to deter <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> from attacking and does not defend; (b) when <b>the</b> <b>terrorist’s</b> resources are high, both <b>the</b> government and <b>terrorist</b> defend and attack. We analyze T periods of the two-stage game between two myopic players. First we assume no linkages between periods. We show that after an attack the government may enjoy incoming resources, which deter <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> for some periods. Between periods <b>the</b> <b>terrorist’s</b> resources may change because of arithmetically and geometrically changing incoming funds.

The government defends an asset and attacks <b>the</b> <b>terrorist’s</b> resources. <b>The</b> <b>terrorist</b> defends its resources and attacks the government. We find four possible equilibrium solutions: (1) the government attacks only, deterring the terrorist; (2) both players defend and attack; (3) the government defends but does not attack, and <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> attacks only; and (4) <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> attacks a passive government. Understanding which factors impact the four cases is important in order to combat terrorism. <b>The</b> <b>terrorist</b> allocates its resources over T periods according to a geometric series with a stockpiling parameter. This article analyzes how <b>the</b> government and <b>terrorist</b> prefer low versus high stockpiling parameters and how these preferences interact with the other parameters such as <b>the</b> <b>terrorist’s</b> resources and <b>the</b> players’ asset valuations, unit defense and attack costs, and discount factors. If <b>the</b> <b>terrorist’s</b> resources are small, it can be deterred in each period. If <b>the</b> <b>terrorist’s</b> resources are extremely large, it allocates its resources equally across the T periods, whereas the government prefers a single attack. If <b>the</b> <b>terrorist’s</b> resources are intermediate, <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> would be deterred in each period if it allocated its resources equally across the T periods.

40|$|Terrorism, {{like other}} forms of {{political}} violence, has an organizational context. Few studies, however, have considered the influence of organizational life upon the outward behavior of <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> group. This thesis explores the possibility that terrorism, {{in addition to its}} political context, reflects the internal dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> group. Assuming that action is what binds <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> group together, <b>the</b> use of violence may oftentimes be dictated more by the need to satisfy the internal goal of group survival than to directly further the group's external political agenda. Focusing upon internal cohesion as the critical mediating variable for group survival, this paper examines how <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> group's efforts to maintain itself drives violent behavior that transcends political considerations and operational prudence. When external and internal requirements become contradictory, <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> group faces a dilemma. Caught in a vicious cycle of reacting to strategic failure with more violent action in order to maintain itself, <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> group generates a negative dynamic of violence that not only undermines its chances of achieving stated long-term goals but also accelerates its decline.
