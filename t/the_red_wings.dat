5|$|In the {{following}} season, {{in the last}} regular season meeting between the Avalanche and <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> on March 26, 1997, a brawl known as the Brawl in Hockeytown broke out. The game ended with nine fights, 11 goals, 39 penalties, 148 penalty minutes, one hat-trick (by Valeri Kamensky) and a goalie fight between Stanley Cup champion goalies Patrick Roy and Mike Vernon. Claude Lemieux {{was one of the}} players singled out by <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> players. <b>The</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> ended up winning the game in overtime 6–5.

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} the Avalanche and <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> was most intense from 1996 to 2002. During those seven seasons {{the two teams}} played five postseason series {{against each other in}} the Stanley Cup playoffs, with the Avalanche winning three of the series (1995–96, 4–2; 1998–99, 4–2; 1999–2000, 4–1) and <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> winning two of them (1996–97, 4–2; 2001–02, 4–3). During this time frame, these two teams {{combined}} for a total of five Stanley Cup championships in seven years, the Avalanche winning twice (1995–96 and 2000–01) and <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> winning three times (1996–97, 1997–98 and 2001–02). After 2002, the rivalry between the two teams began to cool down, and the two teams would not meet again in the playoffs until 2008, when <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> swept the Avalanche in the Western Conference Semi-finals and {{went on to win the}} Stanley Cup. <b>The</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> moved to the Eastern Conference in 2013–14 season as part of the realignment which makes the two rivals only see each other twice a year.|$|E
5|$|Due to pancreatitis, Crozier {{played only}} 58 out of 70 games for <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> in 1966–67. His numbers were {{down as he}} won only 22 games and {{recorded}} a 3.35 GAA. <b>The</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> missed the playoffs. After another bout of pancreatitis {{at the beginning of}} the 1967–68 season, Crozier announced his retirement due to stress and depression. His announcement was short-lived as after six weeks, he returned to hockey. Before re-joining <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Wings,</b> Crozier played five games with the Fort Worth Wings of the Central Professional Hockey League (CPHL) as conditioning. Crozier spent two more seasons on a mediocre Red Wings team before being traded to the newly formed Buffalo Sabres in 1970.|$|E

But in February, Hašek decided to call it quits for the season, which once again solidified Joseph's position as <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> starting goaltender.

5|$|During {{his rookie}} season, Crozier started {{all of his}} team's games, the last goalie {{to do so in}} the NHL. He also led the league in both wins and shutouts with 40 and 6 respectively. His 2.42 GAA was the second lowest in the league. At the end of the season, Crozier was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL's top rookie and he was also named to the NHL First All-Star Team. During his sophomore season, Crozier missed the team's first couple of games due to pancreatitis. He would return and play the team's {{remaining}} 64 games, posting 27 wins and leading the league with seven shutouts. <b>The</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> were also able to clinch a spot in the playoffs. Benefiting from Crozier's strong play in the playoffs, <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals. After eliminating the Black Hawks in the semi-finals, <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> squared off against the Montreal Canadiens in the 1966 Stanley Cup Finals. <b>The</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> won the first two games, but the Canadiens came back and won the next two. During the game four loss, Crozier suffered a leg injury. Although Crozier returned for game five, the injury limited his mobility. In the end, the Canadiens won the Stanley Cup in game six. Even though <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> lost the Stanley Cup, Crozier was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy, which is awarded to the most valuable player in the playoffs. He became the first goaltender to win the award and also the first player to win it in a losing effort.|$|E

When Hašek recovered and got back into his stride, Detroit chose to alternate goaltenders in tandem instead of designating either as the backup. Detroit coach Mike Babcock announced Hašek to start in the 2008 playoffs. Through the first two games against the Nashville Predators, <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> were victorious, but after a lackluster performance in the next two, Osgood was in goal {{for the remainder of the}} playoffs. Despite expressing disappointment at losing his starting position, Hašek maintained his professionalism in practice and continued to support his teammates, with Darren McCarty citing a close relationship between Hašek and Osgood. Eventually <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> beat the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games for the Stanley Cup.|$|E

40|$|If high-{{redshift}} QSOs are {{ejected from}} the nuclei of low-redshift galaxies, as some have claimed, {{a large portion of}} their redshift must be intrinsic (non-Doppler). If these intrinsic components have preferred values, redshifts will tend to cluster around these preferred values and produce peaks in the redshift distribution. Doppler ejection and Hubble flow components will broaden each peak. Because ejection velocities are randomly directed and Hubble flow components are always positive, in this model all peaks are expected to show an asymmetry, extending further out in <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>wing.</b> If peaks are present showing this predicted asymmetry, it can lead directly to an estimate of quasar distances. Using two quasar samples, one with high redshifts and one with low, it is shown here that not only do all peaks in these two redshift distributions occur at previously predicted preferred values, they also all show the predicted extra extension in <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>wing.</b> For <b>the</b> low and high redshift samples the mean cosmological components are found to be z_c∼ 0. 024 and ∼ 0. 066, respectively.
