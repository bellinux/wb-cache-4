[...] Smith credited Swiss theologian Karl Barth for helping him eventually decide to fight apartheid. [...] In 1963, Barth {{asked him if he}} was really free to preach the Gospel in South Africa. [...] Barth asked him the question three times, concluding with [...] "Will you be free to preach the Gospel even if the government in your country tells you that you are preaching against the whole system?" [...] Smith found that [...] "I could not really answer the question truthfully. I thought I was free, and yet I was not sure." [...] Smith later said that he realized he [...] "would have to decide <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>my</b> theology but not apply it, or apply it and take the consequences." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{importance}} of international coöperation outside {{the sphere of}} politics has been brought home {{to me by my}} own experience. Until lately I was engaged in teaching a new science which few men in the world were able <b>to</b> <b>teach.</b> <b>My</b> own work in this science was based chiefly upon the work of a German and an Italian. My pupils came from all over the civilized world: France, Germany, Austria, Russia, Greece, Japan, China, India, and America. None of us was conscious of any sense of national divisions. We felt ourselves an outpost of civilization, building a new road into the virgin forest of the unknown. All coöperated in the common task, and in the interest of such a work the political enmities of nations seemed trivial, temporary, and futile.|$|E
60|$|As I wrote these {{remarkable}} words, I {{was called}} down to eight o'clock prayers, and have just worked through {{a chapter of}} Joshua and five verses, with five treble choruses, of a Samoan hymn; but the music was good, our boys and precentress ('tis always a woman that leads) did better than I ever heard them, and to my great pleasure I understood it all except one verse.

40|$|My {{objective}} was to interpret {{who we are as}} teachers - how a life is also a teaching life. Auto-ethnography is ‘used’ as the facilitator of reflexive disclosure. I adopt a poly-vocal position within a diachronic structure <b>to</b> discuss <b>teaching.</b> <b>My</b> experiences provide a multi-layered perspective in exploring the self, as a locus inquirer. Emerging themes highlight implications for teacher development, pre-service study, public consideration and the self in the context of collective meaning...|$|R

Knights, you are brave men whom I prefer to kill in war. Good horses stand without; take them as my gift, and ride with these foolish citizens of Jerusalem. We may meet again within its streets.

I can see why the ancients demanded a sign of divinity as it were. But for us it has ceased even to be that. It can't be proved. You ask me, {{in the face of}} overwhelming evidence against it, <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>my</b> children that the Incarnation depends on it, but when they grow up and go to college and find it discredited they run the risk of losing everything else with it. And for my part, I fail utterly to see why, if with God all things are possible, it isn't quite as believable, as we gather from St. Mark's Gospel, that he incarnated himself in one naturally born. If you reach the conclusion that Jesus was not a mere individual human person, you reach it through the contemplation of his life and death." ...|$|E
