5|$|Private flying is most {{associated}} with the traditional form of factory-produced two and four-seater, single piston-engine training and <b>touring</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Examples of these are the Cessna 152, Cessna 172, and Piper PA28 Cherokee, all with their origins in the 1950s, and the more modern designs of Cirrus. The average cost per hour to fly such aircraft has been estimated to be £133, compared to an estimated £77 per hour for gliders, and a reported £35 per hour for microlights. Recent trends have seen {{an increase in the}} use of microlights, and also in recreational helicopter flying following the introduction of smaller and cheaper machines such as the Robinson R22 and R44. Another growth area in private flying {{in recent years has been}} in the use of amateur built aircraft, such as the Van's Aircraft RV-4 and the Europa.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, Hanno Fischer, Technical Director of Rhein-Flugzeugbau (RFB), {{developed}} {{an interest in}} aircraft powered by ducted fans integrated into the aircraft structure, flying two modified gliders as testbeds, a VFW-Fokker FK-3 fitted with an eight-bladed ducted fan in the rear fuselage, which flew as the Sirius I in 1969, and a Caproni Vizzola Calif A-21, which flew as the Sirius II on 16 December 1971. Based on the successful results of testing of these aircraft, RFB decided to start work on a two-seat ducted-fan military trainer, intended to offer jet-like handling at low cost, which became the RFB Fantrainer, while in 1972, RFB began studies on a two-seat light <b>touring</b> <b>aircraft</b> with side-by-side seating.|$|E
