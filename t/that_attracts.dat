Pests aggregated on the trap crop can be more easily controlled using pesticides or other methods.

Dying with zero lives gives the player a game over. The levels also include power-ups in television monitors that, when hit, grant the character an extra life, temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of rings, a shield that allows them to breathe underwater, a shield that allows them to withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or a shield <b>that</b> <b>attracts</b> nearby rings.|$|E

5|$|Sol quickly {{falls for}} Naz when they meet, but his anger threatens their relationship. Sol {{has never met}} a girl like Naz before, and Cole said Naz {{probably}} has not met boys like Sol before either. Hussen said {{that there is something}} about Sol <b>that</b> <b>attracts</b> Naz. She is stronger than he is so Naz likes to take him in and teach him things. Cole explained that Sol is attracted to Naz because she is different from other girls and they are complete opposites. and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. One of Cole's first scenes to film was a kiss between Sol and Naz. Cole found it tough and awkward as the actors had only just met, and would have preferred it to be filmed later on, but said that the scene was awkward anyway so {{he did not have to}} act much for it. Sol has also been described as shy, caring, sweet, thoughtful, soft, easily hurt and reserved.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{behaviour}} {{depends on}} the type of termite. For example, certain species feed on the wood structures they inhabit, and others harvest food that is near the nest. Most workers are rarely found out in the open, and do not forage unprotected; they rely on sheeting and runways to protect them from predators. Subterranean termites construct tunnels and galleries to look for food, and workers who manage to find food sources recruit additional nestmates by depositing a phagostimulant pheromone <b>that</b> <b>attracts</b> workers. Foraging workers use semiochemicals to communicate with each other, and workers who begin to forage outside of their nest release trail pheromones from their sternal glands. In one species, Nasutitermes costalis, there are three phases in a foraging expedition: first, soldiers scout an area. When they find a food source, they communicate to other soldiers and a small force of workers starts to emerge. In the second phase, workers appear in large numbers at the site. The third phase is marked by a {{decrease in the number of}} soldiers present and an increase in the number of workers. Isolated termite workers may engage in Lévy flight behaviour as an optimised strategy for finding their nestmates or foraging for food.|$|E

5|$|That praises {{are without}} reason lavished on the dead, {{and that the}} honours due only to {{excellence}} are paid to antiquity, is a complaint likely to be always continued by those, who, being able to add nothing to truth, hope for eminence from the heresies of paradox; or those, who, being forced by disappointment upon consolatory expedients, are willing to hope from posterity what the present age refuses, and flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy, will be at last bestowed by time. Antiquity, like every other quality <b>that</b> <b>attracts</b> the notice of mankind, has undoubtedly votaries that reverence it, not from reason, but from prejudice. Some seem to admire indiscriminately whatever has been long preserved, without considering that time has sometimes co-operated with chance; all perhaps {{are more willing to}} honour past than present excellence; and the mind contemplates genius through the shades of age, as the eye surveys the sun through artificial opacity. The great contention of criticism is to find the faults of the moderns, and the beauties of the ancients. While an authour is yet living we estimate his powers by his worst performance, and when he is dead we rate them by his best.|$|E
