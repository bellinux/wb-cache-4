5000|$|At {{the end of}} 1958, Kartsev {{decided to}} {{modernize}} the Ob'yekt 140 turret. He fitted it with a cartridge-case ejector and mounted it onto a stretched T-55 chassis with a new suspension. He also considered that designs based on already produced vehicles had a higher chance of acceptance. The Ob'yekt 140 <b>turret</b> <b>diameter,</b> bigger than the T-55 turret by 249 mm, made redesigning {{the central part of}} the hull necessary. Kartsev changed the arrangement of the torsion beams, which was necessary to keep the tank's weight balanced. The tank received the designation [...] "Ob'yekt 165" [...] and in November 1958 three prototypes were built. In January 1962, the Ob'yekt 165 was accepted for service under the name T-62A. In the same year, Factory #183 produced five tanks that were put into experimental service.|$|E
50|$|In July 1939 ARL was {{developing}} prototypes {{of both a}} turret, the 5.7 tonne ARL 3 fitted with a turret-basket and having a <b>turret</b> ring <b>diameter</b> of 188 cm, and a gun, also {{in the context of}} the FCM F1 project. FCM was considering use of a revised 7.5 tonne version of the welded octagonal auxiliary turret of the heavy FCM F1, to be equipped with an advanced semi-automatic loader and having a <b>turret</b> ring <b>diameter</b> of 185 cm. As a fallback plan, FCM also was considering the use of the similarly octagonal and welded F4 turret, developed from that of the Char 2C and equipped with the standard 75 mm field gun.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} major advantages: high gun {{placement}}, smaller turret size and simpler fitment of an autoloader. High gun placement allows for better depression angles, reduces the exposed {{part of the}} tank when using hull down positions, and reduces the vertical gap between line of sights and line of the gun. The fact that fully elevated gun does not cross the turret ring allows to reduce <b>turret</b> ring <b>diameter</b> hence width of the vehicles hull and/or mounting the more powerful gun. Autoloader mechanism is simpler and works more reliably when the gun is not moving relative to it.|$|R
5000|$|Both the A13 Mk III Covenanter and the A15 Crusader designs {{used the}} same main turret. The turret was polygonal—with sides that sloped out then in again—to give maximum space on the limited <b>turret</b> ring <b>diameter.</b> Early {{production}} vehicles had a [...] "semi-internal" [...] cast gun mantlet, which was quickly replaced in production by a better protected larger cast mantlet with three vertical slits for the main gun, a coaxial Besa machine gun and for the sighting telescope. There was no cupola for the commander who instead had a flat hatch with the periscope mounted through it.|$|R
2500|$|The White Tower {{takes the}} form of a {{cylindrical}} drum [...] in diameter with a height of [...] above ground level, on top of which is a <b>turret</b> [...] in <b>diameter</b> and [...] high. Some of the embrasures in the outer wall of the tower are reached by a spiral ramp; others are accessed from a central room on each of the six floors.|$|R
5000|$|A leather punch is a {{hole punch}} {{specifically}} for making holes in leather. The working {{tip of the}} punch is a hollow steel cylinder with a sharp circular knife-like edge. The leather piece is placed on a hard surface, which may {{be a part of}} the tool set, and the punch is forced through it, cutting out a small circular piece which is discarded. The punch may be a simple metal tool struck with a hammer; or several such punches may be mounted on a rotary turret on a pliers-like tool with an anvil, with the desired size selected by rotating the <b>turret.</b> Hole <b>diameters</b> typically range from about 1mm to 6mm.|$|R
50|$|In British practice, {{the main}} {{armament}} of the infantry tank went in three phases. The pre-Dunkirk British Army Matilda I {{had only a}} single heavy Vickers machine gun, a compromise forced by the lightness of its chassis and the price it was built to. The Matilda II gained a capable anti-tank capacity for its time, with the 2-pounder, but these were only issued with solid-shot (i.e. non-explosive) for anti-tank use and had little effect as artillery when providing close support for the infantry. The ultimate evolution of the British infantry tank concept began with the Churchill Mk I, where a hull-mounted 3-inch howitzer could support infantry assaults with HE shells while the turret had a 2-pdr for use against other tanks. As the increasing size of tanks, and their <b>turret</b> ring <b>diameters,</b> allowed such a howitzer to be turret-mounted in vehicles such as the Crusader Close Support (CS) and Centaur CS cruiser tanks.|$|R
5000|$|Consisting {{of three}} stylized fins that join mid-height, the {{concrete}} monument {{built by the}} Canadian company Lavalin, based on a model produced in the Fine Art Institute of Algiers, {{under the leadership of}} Bashir Yelles, reaches a height of 92 m. Above the three supporting fins, at 47 ft from the ground, is an Islamic style <b>turret</b> with a <b>diameter</b> of 10 m and a height of 25 ft, topped by a dome of 6 m. It rests on an esplanade that burns an [...] "eternal flame" [...] and includes a crypt, an amphitheater and the Museum of El Mujahid (underground).|$|R
500|$|Measuring , the narthex is {{the part}} of the Round Church which has survived in best shape, as some of its walls reach [...] Its two <b>turrets</b> have a <b>diameter</b> of each has an {{entrance}} facing the interior of the narthex and three windows. The higher reaches of the towers were reached via spiral stairways, archaeological remains of which have been unearthed in the north turret. There are two pairs of columns inside the narthex, supporting its second floor, which is accessible from the north tower. The columns divide the narthex into three naves and mark the way from the narthex entrance to the gates of the rotunda.|$|R
50|$|Measuring 5 x 9.50 m, the narthex is {{the part}} of the Round Church which has survived in best shape, as some of its walls reach 3 m. Its two <b>turrets</b> have a <b>diameter</b> of 3.20 m; each has an {{entrance}} facing the interior of the narthex and three windows. The higher reaches of the towers were reached via spiral stairways, archaeological remains of which have been unearthed in the north turret. There are two pairs of columns inside the narthex, supporting its second floor, which is accessible from the north tower. The columns divide the narthex into three naves and mark the way from the narthex entrance to the gates of the rotunda.|$|R
5000|$|A turret {{was built}} and mounted {{on one of}} the earlier {{development}} vehicles to assess the vehicle's ability to mount the foremost Allied anti-tank gun of the day - the British 17 pounder (76 mm, 3 in). This was achieved by mounting two 25 pounder gun-howitzers which when fired together would significantly exceed the recoil of a 17 pounder. In this configuration the tank was tested on 2 November 1942. It fitted with a 17 pounder and after successful gunnery trials on 17 November 1942 the 17 pounder was selected for the AC4 design. For the AC4 the 17 pounder was to be mounted in a new and larger turret, attached by a 70-inch (1778 mm) <b>diameter</b> <b>turret</b> ring, the space for which was accommodated by changes to the upper hull permitted by the compact nature of the [...] "Perrier-Cadillac".|$|R
50|$|The tank {{had almost}} the same hull and drive train as the T-44A. Differences {{included}} thickened front armour (120 mm on the upper section and 90 mm on the lower section) and a different hatch and vision slot for the driver. The <b>turret</b> had increased <b>diameter</b> to 1800 mm. The armament included the 100 mm D-10TK tank gun {{as well as two}} 7.62 mm GWT machine guns. The tank was powered by a new V-54 12-cylinder 38.88-litre water-cooled diesel engine developing 520 hp (388 kW) at 2,000 rpm. The fuel capacity was increased (530 litres in the internal fuel tank and 165 litres in the external fuel tank). The weight was increased to 35.5 tonnes, which reduced the maximal road speed to 43.5 km/h. Further development of the T-44 was cancelled and all the attention was directed towards the development of the new T-54 main battle tank.|$|R
50|$|Behind {{the driver}} was a {{bulkhead}} that formed another hull cross-member and separated him from the fighting compartment. The first tanks had a two-man turret, the gunner on {{the left of the}} gun and the commander acting also as the loader on the right. When three-man turrets were introduced, the commander sat {{to the rear of the}} turret. The turret was made up of a cast front and a cast rear riveted to the side plates which were of rolled steel. All tanks carried the radio in the turret rear. Early tanks used the Wireless set No. 11 with tannoy for the crew; later tanks had Wireless Set No. 19, which included crew communications with long and short range networks. Turret rotation was by electric motor controlled by the gunner, with a hand-wheel for manual backup. The restrictions that the two-man turret placed on the commander, made more so if they were a troop commander and responsible for directing the actions of two other tanks besides their own, were addressed by enlarging the turret for the Mark III so that a loader for the main armament could be carried. The <b>turret</b> ring <b>diameter</b> was not changed, so the extra space was found by moving the gun mounting forward in an extended front plate and increasing the bulge in the rear of the turret. This increased weight by half a ton on the 2.5 LT two-man turret.|$|R
2500|$|In {{an effort}} to improve further still the {{firepower}} of the Australian produced tanks, a new turret was built and placed {{on the first of}} the earlier development vehicles to assess the vehicle's ability to mount the foremost Allied anti-tank gun of the day – the British 17 pounder (76mm, 3 in). This was achieved by mounting two 25 pounder gun-howitzers which when fired together would significantly exceed the recoil of a 17 pounder. It was later fitted with a 17 pounder and after successful gunnery trials the 17 pounder was selected for the AC4. On the AC4 the 17 pounder was to be mounted in a new and larger turret, attached by a 70inch (1778mm) <b>diameter</b> <b>turret</b> ring, the space for which was accommodated by changes to the upper hull permitted by the compact nature of the [...] "Perrier-Cadillac". The design for the AC4 was not finalised before the programme ended.|$|R
500|$|Ericsson's Monitor, {{which was}} built at Ericsson's yard on the East River in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, {{incorporated}} new and striking design features, the most significant of which were her armor and armament. Instead of {{the large numbers of}} guns of rather small bore that had characterized warships in the past, Ericsson opted for only two guns of large caliber; he wanted to use [...] guns, but had to settle for [...] Dahlgren guns when the larger size were unavailable. These were mounted in a cylindrical <b>turret,</b> [...] in <b>diameter,</b> [...] high, covered with iron [...] thick. The whole rotated on a central spindle, and was moved by a steam engine that could be controlled by one man. [...] Ericsson was afraid that using the full 30 pounds of black powder to fire the huge cannon would raise the risk of an explosion in the turret. [...] He demanded that a charge of 15 pounds be used to lessen this possibility. [...] As with Virginia, trials found that a full charge would pierce armor plate, a finding that would have affected the outcome of the battle. A serious flaw in the design was the pilot house from which the ship would be , a small structure forward of the turret on the main deck. Its presence meant that the guns could not fire directly forward, and it was isolated from other activities on the ship. Despite the late start and the novelty of construction, Monitor was actually completed a few days before her counterpart Virginia, but the Confederates activated Virginia first.|$|R
50|$|Even {{with its}} {{innovative}} technology and better armor protection, the T-44A still used an 85 mm ZiS-S-53 tank gun, {{the same as}} the one fitted on the T-34-85 medium tank. The army needed a new tank armed with a more powerful 100 mm gun. At the end of 1944 the designers had three types of 100 mm guns at their disposal which could considerably increase the firepower of the tank. These included the D-10 (which already proved itself in combat as it was used in SU-100 tank destroyer) as well as prototype ZiS-100 and LB-1 (LB stands for Lavrenty Beria). The T-44 tank armed with the 100 mm tank gun originally received the designation T-44B. Two projects were started, both based on the T-44A. The development of the first one started in October 1944 at the design bureau of the Stalin Ural Tank Factory No. 183, located in Nizhny Tagil. The designing stage was completed in December. The prototype was ready in February 1945. The trials conducted between March and April gave positive results and the vehicle entered service with the Red Army as T-54. The tank had almost the same hull and drive train as the T-44A. Differences included thickened front armour (120 mm on the upper section and 90 mm on the lower section) and a different hatch and vision slot for the driver. The <b>turret</b> had increased <b>diameter</b> to 1800 mm. There was thicker armour (180 mm on the front, between 90 mm and 150 mm on the sides and 30 mm on the roof). The armament included the 100 mm D-10TK tank gun as well as two 7.62 mm GWT machine guns. The tank was powered by a new V-54 12-cylinder 38.88 liter water-cooled diesel engine developing 520 hp (388 kW) at 2,000 rpm. The fuel capacity was increased (530 liters in the internal fuel tank and 165 liters in the external fuel tank). The external fuel tanks were connected to the fuel system. The rubber rollers on the roadwheels were widened. The weight was increased to 35.5 tonnes, which reduced the maximal road speed to 43.5 km/h. The maximal road operational range increased to 360 km. Because of positive results seen in trials, it was decided to modernize the tank before starting production (for more details about it see the T-54/55 article) as well as to put the new tank's turret onto two modified serial T-44A tanks. This was done in 1945 and the two prototype tanks received the designation T-44-100. One of the prototypes was armed with a D-10TK tank gun while the other one was armed with a LB-1 tank gun. Like the second generation T-44-85 prototypes, the two T-44-100 prototypes had differences between each other. One prototype had a splashboard on the glacis plate while the other did not. They both had the 12.7 mm DShK anti-aircraft heavy machine gun fitted to the loader's hatch, 6 mm thick anti-HEAT sideskirts protecting the sides and two cylindrical fuel tanks in the back which increased the fuel capacity to 1035 liters. These cylindrical fuel tanks were later used on Soviet main battle tanks as additional fuel tanks. Further development of the T-44 was canceled and all the attention was directed towards {{the development of a new}} T-54 main battle tank.|$|R
