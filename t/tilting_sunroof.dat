50|$|The 2WD and 4WD sport truck package {{came with}} factory {{air-conditioning}} {{as well as}} the clock and tachometer in the cluster as standard with exclusive gradient-patterned bucket seats for both drivetrains (with the 4WD versions offering the center console and gauges of the DX model, and the 2WD having center console storage in place of the transfer case lever), as well as King-Cab variants. It had similar radio, back-glass, cruise control, and roll-bar/brush guard options as the DX trim. The sport truck package also was the only package with standard power windows and locks (all other packages only received manual locks and windows), as well as a <b>tilting</b> <b>sunroof.</b> ST stickers were placed {{on the end of the}} rear quarter panels. Ironically, the ST package had no performance modifications, however in the 1986 model year it had an optional Z24i single-port fuel injected engine.|$|E

5000|$|A special Ford of Britain-only {{marketing}} pack {{edition of}} the Ghia X model was later introduced as the [...] "Ford Granada Ghia X Executive" [...] which standardised luxury appointments such as the high-grade Connolly Leather interior {{that had previously been}} an optional fitment. Further refinements such an electric slide and <b>tilt</b> <b>sunroof,</b> electric boot release on saloons, electric seat adjustment, heated seats, trip computer, and air conditioning set the Granada Ghia X above most other cost-comparable executive cars available in the UK in the early '80s. The special [...] "Taxi" [...] edition was available only in black, which included a foot-operated [...] "panic button" [...] in the driver's footwell which would operate the alarm system. In addition to these two models, the range was complemented by estate models which reflected the same appointment levels as the entire saloon range, including the Ghia X, but not the Ghia X Executive model.|$|R

2500|$|The base {{two-seater}} {{model was}} discontinued, having sold 3,017 units in 18 months. Gremlins also switched from non-synchronized 1st gear manual transmissions to full synchromesh, and the Borg-Warner-sourced automatic transmission {{was replaced by}} the Chrysler-designed TorqueFlite. Other more minor technical upgrades improved the car's reliability and durability. The Gremlin X package continued to be popular, while optional features now included an AM/FM radio, fabric <b>sunroof,</b> <b>tilt</b> steering wheel, inside hood release, trailer towing package for up to [...] with a Class 1 hitch, as well as manual or power assisted front disk brakes.|$|R

5000|$|The Eclipse was {{available}} in 7 trim levels: RS, GS, GS Spyder, GT, GT Spyder, GTS, and GTS Spyder. All trim levels (besides Spyder) came with an automatic <b>tilt</b> and retracting <b>sunroof.</b> All models were FWD. The GTS trims were introduced for the 2003 model year.

5000|$|The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the US {{base model}} 1992 SVX-L was $24,445, {{with the top}} of the line model with touring package (leather trim, 8 way {{electronic}} seat adjustment, <b>tilt</b> and slide <b>sunroof),</b> the LS-L, listing at $28,000. This was $8,000-$11,000 higher than any previous Subaru. A rear spoiler was optional on the 1992 L and LS-L models and was included as standard equipment beginning in 1993. There was a brief XR model in 1992 that was made on the first production run that included the spoiler standard but put the vehicle over the import weight limit. As a result, the spoiler was shipped separately. On the other hand, it was almost $5,000 lower than a comparable four wheel drive Dodge Stealth R/T/Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4, though with almost 100 additional horsepower, the Stealth/3000GT twins were much faster and more technologically advanced. By the end of its production run in 1996, the price had risen to $36,740 for the top-of-the-line LSi, which was the same trim level as the 1992 LS-L ...|$|R
