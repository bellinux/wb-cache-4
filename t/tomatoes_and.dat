40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{sustainable}} fertilizers because common mineral fertilizers are increasingly costly and often induce water and air pollution. For instance, seagrass compost could be used as fertilizer in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean, thus also solving the issue of beached residues. Here, we studied organic fertilization by application of seagrass-based compost in a <b>tomato</b> <b>and</b> lettuce crop succession. Composts were made of posidonia and yard wastes at 1 / 4 w/w fresh weight ratio. Compost was applied at two concentrations: 10 and 20 Mg/ha fresh weight. Fresh leaves of posidonia were also tested directly as organic mulch in plots treated with conventional fertilizers. A control treatment involved mineral fertilization without mulching soil. Herbicide applications were performed in non-mulched plots immediately before transplanting of <b>tomato</b> <b>and</b> lettuce for controlling the weeds, while mulched treatments did not receive any herbicide application. Results show that 20 Mg ha− 1 of posidonia-based compost is equivalent to the inorganic fertilization because the nutritional status <b>and</b> yield of <b>tomato</b> <b>and</b> lettuce were statistically similar. No phytotoxicity symptoms were observed in any of the <b>tomato</b> <b>and</b> lettuce plants mulched with posidonia. The same growth rate was observed for <b>tomato</b> <b>and</b> lettuce growing under conventional management practices: mineral fertilizer and herbicide applications. Overall, our findings show that seagrass-based compost is a promising, sustainable fertilizer for <b>tomato</b> <b>and</b> lettuce...|$|R

5|$|As {{the home}} country of {{beetroot}} borscht, Ukraine boasts great {{diversity of the}} soup's regional variants, with virtually every province having its own recipe. Differences between particular varieties may regard the type of stock used (meat, bone, or both), the kind of meat (beef, pork, poultry, etc.), the choice of vegetables and the method of cutting and cooking them. For example, although the typical recipe calls for beef and pork, the Kiev variant uses mutton or lamb as well as beef, while in the Poltava region, the stock for borscht is cooked on poultry meat, that is, chicken, duck or goose. The use of zucchini, beans and apples is characteristic of the Chernihiv borscht; in this variant, beetroots are sautéed in vegetable oil rather than lard, and the sour taste comes solely from <b>tomatoes</b> <b>and</b> tart apples. The Lviv borscht is based on bone stock and is served with chunks of Vienna sausages.|$|E
