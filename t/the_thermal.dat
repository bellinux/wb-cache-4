5|$|The {{theoretical}} {{thermal conductivity}} of hexagonal Boron nitride nanoribbons (BNNRs) can approach 1700–2000 W/(m·K), {{which has the}} same order of magnitude as the experimental measured value for graphene, and can be comparable to the theoretical calculations for graphene nanoribbons. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>thermal</b> transport in the BNNRs is anisotropic. <b>The</b> <b>thermal</b> conductivity of zigzag-edged BNNRs is about 20% larger than that of armchair-edged nanoribbons at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>thermal</b> {{analysis}} {{was the first}} done for any casting process. This was done by creating an electrical analog of <b>the</b> <b>thermal</b> system. A cross-section of the dies were drawn on Teledeltos paper and then thermal loads and cooling patterns were drawn onto the paper. Water lines were represented by magnets of various sizes. <b>The</b> <b>thermal</b> conductivity was represented by the reciprocal of the resistivity of the paper.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is thought}} to have a body-centered cubic crystal {{structure}} from absolute zero to its melting point, high-resolution measurements of <b>the</b> <b>thermal</b> expansion along the three crystallographic axes reveal anisotropies which are inconsistent with a cubic structure. Therefore, further research and discovery in this area is expected.|$|E
5000|$|Harris {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} <b>the</b> first <b>Thermals</b> record, More Parts per Million, {{in the kitchen}} of his one-bedroom house in Southeast Portland in early 2002.

[...] The original live line-up of <b>The</b> <b>Thermals</b> consisted of Kathy Foster on bass, Jordan Hudson on drums, Ben Barnett on guitar, and Harris on lead vocals. Barnett departed <b>The</b> <b>Thermals</b> soon after More Parts per Million was released, and <b>The</b> <b>Thermals</b> became a three-piece.

5|$|In 1962, Kestin and Persen {{published}} a paper describing solutions for heat transfer when <b>the</b> <b>thermal</b> boundary layer is contained entirely within the momentum layer and for various wall temperature distributions.

5|$|Metals make {{relatively}} good conductors of heat, primarily because the delocalized electrons {{are free to}} transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical conductivity, <b>the</b> <b>thermal</b> conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann–Franz law, which states that the ratio of thermal conductivity to the electrical conductivity {{is proportional to the}} temperature. <b>The</b> <b>thermal</b> disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical resistivity of the material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.|$|E

25|$|The term {{thermal wind}} is often {{considered}} a misnomer, since it really describes {{the change in}} wind with height, rather the wind itself. However, one can view <b>the</b> <b>thermal</b> wind as a geostrophic wind that varies with height, so that the term wind seems appropriate. In {{the early years of}} meteorology, when data was scarce, the wind field could be estimated using <b>the</b> <b>thermal</b> wind relation and knowledge of a surface wind speed and direction as well as thermodynamic soundings aloft. In this way, <b>the</b> <b>thermal</b> wind relation acts to define the wind itself, rather than just its shear. Many authors retain <b>the</b> <b>thermal</b> wind moniker, even though it describes a wind gradient, sometimes offering a clarification to that effect.|$|E
25|$|Mathematically, <b>the</b> <b>thermal</b> wind {{relation}} {{defines a}} vertical wind shear--a variation in wind speed or direction with height. The wind shear {{in this case}} is a function of a horizontal temperature gradient, which is a variation in temperature over some horizontal distance. Also called baroclinic flow, <b>the</b> <b>thermal</b> wind varies with height in proportion to the horizontal temperature gradient. <b>The</b> <b>thermal</b> wind relation results from hydrostatic balance and geostrophic balance {{in the presence of a}} temperature gradient along constant pressure surfaces, or isobars.|$|E
