25|$|Patients with MDR-TB {{should be}} {{isolated}} in negative-pressure rooms, if possible. Patients with MDR-TB {{should not be}} accommodated on the same ward as immunosuppressed patients (HIV infected patients, or patients on immunosuppressive drugs). Careful monitoring of compliance with treatment {{is crucial to the}} management of MDR-TB (and some physicians insist on hospitalisation if only for this reason). Some physicians will insist that these patients are isolated until their sputum is smear negative, or even culture negative (which may take many months, or even years). Keeping these patients in hospital for weeks (or months) on end may be a practical or physical impossibility and the final decision depends on the clinical judgement of the physician treating that patient. The attending physician should make full use of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>drug</b> monitoring (particularly of the aminoglycosides) both to monitor compliance and to avoid toxic effects.|$|E
500|$|Saffron {{played a}} {{significant}} role in the Greco-Roman pre-classical period bracketed by the 8th century BC and the 3rd century AD. The first known image of saffron in pre-Greek culture is much older and stems from the Bronze Age. A saffron harvest is shown in the Knossos palace frescoes of Minoan Crete, which depict the flowers being picked by young girls and monkeys. One of these fresco sites is located in the [...] "Xeste 3" [...] building at Akrotiri, on the Aegean island of Santorinithe ancient Greeks knew it as [...] "Thera". These frescoes likely date from the 16th or 17th century BC but may have been produced anywhere between 30001100BC. They portray a Minoan goddess supervising the plucking of flowers and the gleaning of stigmas for use in the manufacture of what is possibly a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>drug.</b> A fresco from the same site also depicts a woman using saffron to treat her bleeding foot. These [...] "Theran" [...] frescoes are the first botanically accurate visual representations of saffron's use as an herbal remedy. This saffron-growing Minoan settlement was ultimately destroyed by a powerful earthquake and subsequent volcanic eruption sometime between 1645 and 1500 BC. The volcanic ash from the destruction entombed and helped preserve these key herbal frescoes.|$|E

2500|$|Attempts to {{establish}} rates of vancomycin-induced ototoxicity {{are even more}} difficult due to the scarcity of quality evidence. The current consensus is that clearly related cases of vancomycin ototoxicity are rare. The association between vancomycin serum levels and ototoxicity is also uncertain. While cases of ototoxicity {{have been reported in}} patients whose vancomycin serum level exceeded 80nbsp&µg/ml, cases have been reported in patients with therapeutic levels, as well. Thus, whether <b>therapeutic</b> <b>drug</b> monitoring of vancomycin for the purpose of maintaining [...] "therapeutic" [...] levels will prevent ototoxicity also remains unproven.|$|E
2500|$|Plasma level {{monitoring}} of vancomycin is necessary {{due to the}} drug's biexponential distribution, intermediate hydrophilicity, and potential for ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, especially in populations with poor renal function and/or increased propensity to bacterial infection.

Thus, peak serum levels have not been shown to correlate with efficacy or toxicity; indeed, concentration monitoring is unnecessary in most cases. Circumstances in which <b>therapeutic</b> <b>drug</b> monitoring [...] is warranted include: patients receiving concomitant aminoglycoside therapy, patients with (potentially) altered pharmacokinetic parameters, patients on haemodialysis, patients administered high-dose or prolonged treatment, and patients with impaired renal function.

Estudos de Utilização de Medicamentos, atividade da Farmacoepidemiologia, fornecem importantes informações sobre todas as fases do uso dos fármacos em uma sociedade e suas conseqüências, evidenciando como é feita a gestão saúde/doença. Neste estudo objetivou-se avaliar o uso de medicamentos na rede pública {{municipal}} de saúde de Campo Grande/MS, empregando a metodologia preconizada pela OMS, através dos Indicadores Selecionados de Uso de Medicamentos. Para o cálculo dos indicadores foram coletados dados em 12 unidades sanitárias no período de Julho/ 98 a Junho/ 99. Foram analisadas 1480 prescrições, acompanhadas 1456 consultas e 1498 dispensações e foram entrevistados 735 usuários. Os resultados encontrados são compatíveis com os de outros estudos análogos realizados em diversas regiões do país. No entanto, importantes diferenças entre as equipes no uso de antibióticos e injetáveis sugerem a necessidade de pesquisas mais aprofundadas.
