5|$|Apart {{from its}} long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back {{differentiate}} the hartebeest from other antelopes. The hartebeest shares several physical traits with the sassabies (genus Damaliscus), {{such as an}} elongated and narrow face, {{the shape of the}} horns, the pelage texture and colour, and the terminal tuft of the tail. The wildebeest have more specialised skull and horn features than the hartebeest. The hartebeest exhibits sexual dimorphism, but only slightly, as both sexes bear horns and have similar body masses. The degree of sexual dimorphism varies by subspecies. Males are 8% heavier than females in Swayne's and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, and 23% heavier in the red hartebeest. In one study, the highest dimorphism was found in skull weight. Another study concluded that the length of the breeding season is a good predictor of dimorphism in pedicle (the bony structures from which the horns grow) height and skull weight, and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>predictor</b> of the horn circumference.|$|E
5|$|Motor symptoms, if not treated, advance aggressively in {{the early}} stages of the disease and more slowly later. Untreated, {{individuals}} are expected to lose independent ambulation after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten years. However, it is uncommon to find untreated people nowadays. Medication has improved the prognosis of motor symptoms, while at the same time it is a new source of disability, because of the undesired effects of levodopa after years of use. In people taking levodopa, the progression time of symptoms to a stage of high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years. However, it is hard to predict what course the disease will take for a given individual. Age is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>predictor</b> of disease progression. The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis, while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset.|$|E

High cohesion and morale enhance adaptive stress reactions.|$|E
25|$|According to {{a popular}} science book by the {{journalist}} Daniel Goleman, emotional intelligence accounts for more career success than IQ. Similarly, other studies argued that employees high on EI perform substantially better than employees low in EI. This measured by self-reports and different work performance indicators, such as wages, promotions and salary increase. According to Lopes and his colleagues (2006), EI contributes to develop strong and positive relationships with co-workers and perform efficiently in work teams. This benefits performance of workers by providing emotional support and instrumental resources needed to succeed in their roles. Also, emotional intelligent employees have better resources to cope with stressing situations and demanding tasks, which enable them to outperform in those situations. For instance, Law et al. (2004) found that EI was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>predictor</b> of job performance beyond general cognitive ability among IT scientist in computer company in China. Similarly, Sy, Tram, and O’Hara (2006) found that EI was associated positively with job performance in employees from a food service company.|$|E
25|$|As earlier stated, extraverts {{are often}} {{found to have}} higher levels of {{happiness}} and positive affect than introverts. An influential review article concluded that personality, specifically extraversion and emotional stability, was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>predictor</b> of subjective well-being. As examples, Argyle and Lu (1990) found that the trait of extraversion, as measured by Extraversion Scale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), was positively and significantly correlated with happiness, as measured by the Oxford Happiness Inventory. Using the same happiness and extraversion scales, Hills and Argyle (2001) found that happiness was again significantly correlated with extraversion. Also, the study by Emmons and Diener (1986) showed that extraversion correlates positively and significantly with positive affect but not with negative affect. Similar results were found in a large longitudinal study by Diener, Sandvik, Pavot, and Fujita (1992), which assessed 14,407 participants from 100 areas of continental United States. Using the abbreviated General Well-Being Schedule, which tapped positive and negative affects, and Costa and McCrae's (1986) short version of the NEO's Extraversion scale, the authors reported that extraverts experienced greater well-being at two points in time, during which data were collected: first between 1971 and 1975, and later between 1981 and 1984. Furthermore, Larsen and Ketelaar (1991) showed that extraverts respond more to positive affect than to negative affect, since they exhibit more positive-affect reactivity to the positive-affect induction, yet they do not react more negatively to the negative-affect induction.|$|E

The neurological score at the initial evaluation done 72 hours after injury is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>predictor</b> of how much function will return. Most people with ASIA scores of A (complete injuries) do not have functional motor recovery, but improvement can occur. Most patients with incomplete injuries recover at least some function. Chances of recovering the ability to walk improve with each AIS grade found at the initial examination; e.g. an ASIA D score confers a better chance of walking than a score of C. The symptoms of incomplete injuries can vary {{and it is difficult to}} make an accurate prediction of the outcome. [...] A person with a mild, incomplete injury at the T5 vertebra will have a much better chance of using his or her legs than a person with a severe, complete injury at exactly the same place.

40|$|In {{regression}} models involving economic {{variables such as}} income, log transformation is typically taken to achieve approximate normality and stabilize the variance. However, often the interest is predicting individual values or means of the variable in the original scale. Back transformation of predicted values introduces a non-negligible bias. Moreover, assessing {{the uncertainty of the}} actual predictor is not straightforward. In this paper, a nested error model for the log transformation of the target variable is considered. Nested error models are widely used for estimation of means in subpopulations with small sample sizes (small areas), by linking all the areas through common parameters. These common parameters are estimated using the overall set of sample data, which leads to much more efficient small area estimators. Analytical expressions for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>predictors</b> of individual values of the original variable and of small area means are obtained under the nested error model with log transformation of the target variable. Empirical <b>best</b> <b>predictors</b> are defined by estimating the unknown model parameters in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>predictors.</b> Exact mean squared errors of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>predictors</b> and second order approximations to the mean squared errors of <b>the</b> empirical <b>best</b> <b>predictors</b> are derived.
