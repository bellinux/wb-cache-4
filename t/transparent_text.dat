40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{software}} tools are available to assist researchers {{with the process of}} qualitative data analysis. These include tools that emphasise manual handling of data, (e. g. NVivo, Atlas. ti) and tools that provide some automated analysis based on statistical properties of texts (e. g. Leximancer). These tools are enhancing research, making research activities less complex and tedious, and rendering the process more transparent and portable (Dohan et al. 1998; Welsh 2002; Andrew et al. 2007; Jones 2007). The use of these tools in published works over the last five to ten years has become increasingly more evident. However, in many cases, this increase in frequency of use is also masking the actual method of research. Many researchers who use terms like “Data were analysed using NVivo” are using their chosen analytical package as a proxy for actual embedded methods of analysis. It is possible therefore that Computer-Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis (CAQDA) tools are becoming a substitute for actual, and perhaps valid, techniques for research, analysis and discovery. This paper investigates the extent of this problem, examining CAQDA based papers which have been published {{over the last five years}} and reporting on their use, or misuse, of methodology. Further, this paper proposes a solution to the problem by adopting a CAQDA technique which utilises a generic style of methodology. A tool used by Quantitative researchers, known as ‘R’, is available which is a free, open source statistical programming language. Within the last five years R has become the lingua franca for statisticians and applied workers to publish reference implementations for novel quantitative techniques. No such tool with sufficient flexibility exists for qualitative researchers. We describe the initial development of a transparent file format and research process which keeps the researcher close to the data and provides strong safeguards against accidental data alteration. This has two main effects. The transparency of the file format keeps the researcher close to the data, and ensures that the researcher keeps in mind the process used to analyse the data rather than the tool in use. The second effect, also related to the open source, <b>transparent</b> plain <b>text</b> basis of the tool, means that an environment for fostering innovation in qualitative data analysis can be easily provided and freely distributed among workers in the field...|$|R
40|$|Sections 1 and 2 {{constitute}} the {{critical component of}} this thesis, and they serve to contextualise the Hungarian translation of Book Three of Alasdair Gray’s Lanark, which follows them. Section 1 is a brief and selective exploration {{of the history of}} Hungarian literary translation, which draws on Lawrence Venuti’s concept of the translator’s invisibility to highlight influences that may affect the contemporary Hungarian translator’s work. In Venuti’s Western translation model a <b>transparent</b> target <b>text</b> masquerades as non-translation and creates the illusion of access to an unadulterated original. East European translation has not been shaped by the same historical forces as its Western counterpart, and therefore its theorisation requires a different critical vocabulary, but the notion of invisibility remains relevant. East European literary cultures have been influenced by Communist politics, a collective sense of inferiority in relation to the West, and the need to construct a national identity through art, all of which has {{led to the development of}} a cultural paradigm that accords great importance to translation, and views it as a creative, rather than derivative, process. This approach to translation was particularly strong in Hungary in the first half of the twentieth century, when literary translators enjoyed great prestige and freedom in their treatment of source texts. Translations published in the literary journal Nyugat [West], including Dezső Kosztolányi’s translation of Edgar Allan Poe’s ‘The Raven’, reveal assumptions about the nature and purpose of translation that are very different from contemporary Western attitudes. Section 2 examines the problem of translating simple language into Hungarian. It starts with a discussion of translating Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and the challenge the repetitive language poses for the translator. It then considers historical factors which may account for the place that the ‘plain style’ has come to occupy in English literary cultures, and contrasts it with the status conferred by linguistic complexity in Hungarian fiction. A close textual analysis of a passage from Lanark illustrates the problem of preserving the linguistically simple yet thematically complex nature of the source text without creating the impression of an oversimplified, unsophisticated and ‘un-literary’ translation. Further problems are explored in this section that emerged during the translation of Book Three of Lanark, and some choices regarding the translation of units of measurement and dialogue are explained. A Hungarian translation of Book Three of Lanark follows the analytical sections...|$|R

40|$|The central {{research}} issue {{addressed by}} this dissertation {{is how we}} can design systems where information on user interface tools is overlaid on the work product being developed with these tools. The interface tools typically appear in the display foreground while the data or work space being manipulated typically appear in the perceptual background. This represents a trade-off in focused foreground attention versus focused background attention. By better supporting human attention we hope to improve the fluency of work, where fluency is reflected in a more seamless integration between task goals, user interface tool manipulations to achieve these goals, and feedback from the data or work space being manipulated. This research specifically focuses on the design and evaluation of transparent user interface'layers'applied to graphical user interfaces. By allowing users to see through windows, menus, and tool palettes appearing in the perceptual foreground, an improved awareness of the underlying workspace and preservation of context are possible. However, transparent overlapping objects introduce visual interference which may degrade task performance, through reduced legibility. This dissertation explores a new interface technique (i. e., transparent layering) and, more importantly, undertakes a deeper investigation into the underlying issues that have implications for the design and use of this new technique. We have {{conducted a series of}} experiments, progressively more representative of the complex stimuli from real task domains. This enables us to systematically evaluate a variety of transparent user interfaces, while remaining confident of the applicability of the results to actual task contexts. We also describe prototypes and a case study evaluation of a working system using transparency based on our design parameters and experimental findings. Our findings indicate that similarity in both image color and in image content affect the levels of visual interference. Solid imagery in either the user interface tools (e. g., icons) or in the work space content (e. g., video, rendered models) are highly interference resistant and work well up to 75 % transparent (i. e., 25 % of foreground image and 75 % of background content). Text and wire frame images (or line drawings) perform equally poorly but are highly usable up to 50 % transparent, with no apparent performance penalty. Introducing contrasting outlining techniques improves the usability of <b>transparent</b> <b>text</b> menu interfaces up to 90 % transparency. These results suggest that transparency is a usable and promising interface alternative. We suggest several methods of overcoming today's technical challenges in order to integrate transparency into existing applications. ...|$|E

40|$|Pierre Schaeffer's Typo-Morphology of Sonic Objects’ {{proposes to}} present to the English-speaking reader the two {{accomplished}} stages of Schaeffer's 1966 solfège, namely typology and morphology, as expounded in Traité des objets musicaux, situating them in the larger context of Schaeffer's musicological work, and in the specific context of the solfège. This is done through translation of and commentary on Schaeffer's writing. Chapter I surveys the years 1948 – 57, exposing the shifts of priorities that define three phases: research into noises, concrete music, and experimental music. Particular attention is paid to Schaeffer's conception of experimental music, and through the analysis of ‘Vers une musique expérimentale’, what has generally been seen as an antagonism between the Paris and the Cologne studios emerges as the conflict between two opposing approaches to technology and tradition. Chapter II delineates three notions that underpin the fourth phase of Schaeffer's musicological work, musical research, of which the 1966 solfège is the programme: acousmatic listening, four listening functions, and sonic object. Chapter III elaborates on the premisses of typology and morphology. Chapter IV expounds typology proper, whilst chapter V presents morphology and the sketch of the subsequent operations of solfège: characterology and analysis. From this study, it emerges that Traité des objets musicaux is first and foremost an inexhaustible repository of insights into sound perception. Typology, the first stage of the solfège, is doubtless a successfully accomplished project. However, as a method for discovering a universal musicality, the solfège enterprise needs to be viewed with caution. It suffers from the almost open-ended nature of its metaphorical vocabulary, the emphasis the text lays on reactive rhetoric, its reliance on ‘methods of approximation’, and from a gradual distancing from perceptual reality itself. This notwithstanding, Traité des objets musicaux appears as a fundamental text of twentieth-century musicology. It brings to the fore two crucial issues: technology and the ways it alters our manner of perceiving and expressing reality, and reality itself thereby; the friction between sounds and musical structures, <b>transparent</b> in the <b>text</b> as the friction between isolated words and the discourse, transparent in Schaeffer's life as the friction between the man and the social structures he has needed to fit in...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographies. As {{a feminist}} {{exploration}} of the problematic relationship between Afrikaans women and Afrikaner nationalism, this thesis is primarily concerned {{with the construction of}} the social identities of Afrikaans women between 1919 and 1931, the crucial formative years of Afrikaner nationalism. The relationship between women and Afrikaner nationalism is thus addressed by an investigation at the level of intellectual history. The emergence of Afrikaner nationalism {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century was accompanied by the articulation of a distinctive gender discourse, the study of which is central to this thesis. Within this discourse, which may be termed the "volksmoeder" discourse, a new identity and new roles were contrived for Afrikaner women. We first investigate the social and historical context in which the discourse was generated and then analyse the "volksmoeder" discourse itself by focusing on texts from Die Boerevrou, a women's magazine launched by Mabel Malherbe in 1919. Rather than taking the Die Boerevrou-texts for granted or seeing them as simple reflections of reality, they are investigated as constructions. The questions of why these particular constructions had appeared in that specific context and what ends they achieved are posed. Rather than simply taking the discursive constructions at face value they are construed as "answers" to certain underlying social and historical issues. On a theoretical level the problem of the construction of gender and ethnic identities is informed by recent work in the field of discourse analysis, while the imagining or invention of nation-communities is discussed with reference to the work of Benedict Anderson, Ernst Gellner, Eric Hobsbawm and Tom Nairn. The investigation of Die Boerevrou-texts as particular articulations of the volksmoeder discourse shows how the social identities of Afrikaans women were socially constructed in the volksmoeder discourse. It suggests that the social subjectivities of Afrikaans women were by no means simple or <b>transparent.</b> In the <b>texts</b> of Die Boerevrou it becomes clear that even while being shaped by Afrikaner nationalism, women themselves were active in the shaping of Afrikaner nationalism. While they were constituted as subjects in the anti-feminist discourse of Afrikaner nationalism, they remained mobile within this discourse: always negotiating, planning, creating and articulating new identities and roles for themselves. The image of women as passive victims of a male Afrikaner discourses is thus denied. However, it is asserted that the volksmoeder discourse as a gender discourse can and should be severely criticised from a feminist perspective...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} this paper is to present and discuss a project for {{in-service}} training of some teachers employed within advanced vocational education (AVE), part of higher education in Finland. The political visions of an increased proportion of people with higher education, not only in Finland but in the Western world as a whole, have contributed to teachers encountering with new groups of students with non-academic backgrounds. These students have been accepted for studies but an increasing proportion fail in examinations. Especially language teachers at this specific AVE, a small polytechnic institution, were concerned about how the situation had developed. According to their understanding, an increasing amount of the students had dyslexia. Therefore the had attended courses and lectures, which however did not provide them with the tools they needed. An expert was enrolled, in order to work with the students. Instead of working with remedial programmes, her work focused on students; reading and writing strategies, which became a success. As a result, the school wanted her to work with an increasing number of students. Instead an in-service training project that would provide the teachers with the competence of the expert was initiated. The project was designed based on socio-cultural perspectives on learning, drawing on the concepts distributed expertise (Palinscar & Brown, 1984), literacy practices (Street, 1984; Gee, 1996; Lea & Street, 1998) and cognitive apprenticeship (Rogoff, 1984, 1990). As a whole, the project consisted of two parts: firstly, the experts work with the students, and secondly, the in-service training for teachers. Here, the main focus is on in-service training for the teachers but as the content of this in-service training is students' reading and writing strategies, it is necessary to describe part of the project directed towards the students as well. The aim of the work directed to students at risk was on the one hand related to trying out and developing appropriate tools for identifying students at risk, and to explore their current reading and writing strategies and making the students aware of and other, more relevant strategies as well as helping them to change their current strategies on the other. The expert's findings about students' current strategies contribute to the picture of the characteristics of readers and writers inadequate strategies for reading and writing. Her work also included identifying what kind of reading and writing was expected from the students within each of the eight programmes included in the project. In all, 112 students were tested, 57 of these were offered the programme, 41 students accepted joining the programme and 29 finished it. The aim of the in-service training was to make it possible for the teachers to appropriate the competencies of the expert. Therefore the in-service project was designed on ideas of cognitive apprenticeship and distributed expertise. In other words, the expertise was to be distributed to the teachers attending the in-service programme. The programme started with only two teachers; a year later they were expected to take over some of the work and new teachers were accepted for the programme as newcomers, and after one more year further teachers were invited. As a complement to apprenticeship, seminars related to specific texts were offered. In manual work, apprenticeship is organised in relation to a production that involves material, tools, and techniques - in a way this work is transparent. When it comes to cognitive work, the material, tools and techniques are opaque rather than transparent, therefore the design of cognitive apprenticeship must involve possibilities for making the competence underlying planning, decision-making and reflection more <b>transparent.</b> The <b>text</b> seminars mentioned were one means offered in order to make the expert's competencies visible. In the paper these ideas are further developed. The results of the project are discussed on two levels. Firstly in relation to teachers' knowledge formation - that is their struggle with their strong contemporary conception of these students' as suffering from dyslexia on the one hand and with their emerging insights of the relational and contextual aspects of what it means to become literate within a specific AVE-programme. Secondly, the results are related to organisational conditions for these teachers to use the competence they have appropriated. Finally, we discuss the relation between the practice-concept in New Literacy Studies and that used in studies based on socio-cultural and activity theoretical studies...|$|R
40|$|In exile on the Côte d’Azur Charlotte Salomon (Berlin 1917 -Auschwitz 1943) painted Leben?oder Theater? (LT). The work, an {{impressive}} life-story, comprises {{more than a}} thousand pages: gouaches, painted text and <b>text</b> fragments on <b>transparent</b> paper. Since 1971 LT has been {{in the collection of the}} Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam. LT has been discussed from different perspectives. My accent will be on the use of three media – music, word, image – in interaction. LT springs from song, as Salomon tells in an introductory fragment. Music is present in quotes of melodies, from popular song to opera. This is undoubtedly connected with het stepmother, the opera singer Paula Lindberg and her singing teacher Alfred Wolfsohn. My text consists of three parts: the first part has a biographical character. Given the relationship between life and work of Charlotte Salomon, it is logical to go into both the autobiographical base and the work itself. The destinies of Charlotte Salomon and Charlotte Kann (alter ego in LT) are marked by suicide. In LT it is not the historical truth which comes first, but the experience as remembered and structured in a definite way. The political development was to be fatal to Charlotte Salomon, but not to her alter ego. In the second part musical quotes – mostly (part of) a line from an opera – are central. An intertextual interpretation shows that both the characters and the theme get more emphasis in that way, especially fate (Der Freischtz by Weber), love and jealousy (Carmen by Bizet), love, death and creativity (Orfeo ed Eurydice by Gluck). Characters as Franziska (Charlotte’s mother), Paulinka Bimbam and Amadeus Daberlohn are detached from their biographical roots and embedded in European culture. The relationship between word and image is the subject of part three, in the first place concentrated on text and subsequently on the motif of the window. The design of the text fragments is adapted to image, though a difference has to be made between <b>text</b> on <b>transparent</b> paper and <b>text</b> integrated in the image. Analysis of comics produces useful clues for LT, such as form, function and depth. In LT dialogues often appear in an undulating pattern, presented as a visual-spatial sign. The wave evokes associations with movement and water (suicide, happiness), and music (counterpart of suicide). Te window as gateway to another world is hardly surprising, but it does not explain why this motif occurs so often. From an analysis of motif and text emerges the association between (breaking) glass and a fragile Jewish identity. The window, however, can also function as a refuge for the imagination or dream world. The end of LT fits in with the beginning: Charlotte Salomon converges with her alter ego. The frame of Charlotte Kann’s transparent sketchbook functions as window to the past and as a gateway to her imagination. The pages will, just as LT, be evidence of creativity and as a victory over fate...|$|R

Imsen has sought to re-implement Tartini’s patterns of embellishments, {{as well as other}} stylistic features, as found in the historical material – primarily in Tartini’s obscure treatise of ornamentation. The final result of the project, “The Tartini Style”, has been presented as a recording of violin sonatas by Giuseppe Tartini, along with a critical reflection that accounts for the historical sources, methods and development of Imsen's performance. The recorded material that has been assessed consists of sonata in F, B. F 4, sonata in g, B. g 5 (“The Devil’s Sonata”) and the pastorale in scordatura B. A 16, the latter performed on the Hardanger fiddle. These three sonatas were released on Pure Audio Blu-Ray by Lindberg Lyd in 2015. " - - - The present text is an account of my work as an artistic research fellow at the Norwegian Academy of Music during the years 2006 to 2009. Naturally, as many years have passed since the fellowship period ended, this account will also involve the continuation of my work since then. However, throughout these years, my work has developed along the same lines, ideas and sources of inspiration as it did from the very beginning. My years as a research fellow have offered the luxury to concentrate on one idea and pursue it in depth. As a violinist, I have had the opportunity and privilege to expand my skills as an artist in what has become my field of specification; my artistic home and my default point of departure when approaching music of the 18 thcentury. In my everyday life I work as a full-time tutti violinist in a modern symphony orchestra, and being granted three years of in-depth study has been of invaluable importance for my professional development. It has proven difficult to bring the project to an end. My previous efforts to finish failed, for different reasons. Presenting the results of my work is demanding on resources, not least financial, and I am grateful that the NMH and the Steering Committee have contributed sufficiently to this final presentation. I have now chosen an entirely different form of presentation:a Blu-ray disc multichannel recording rather than a live performance. Further, I have revised some central issues: The focus has shifted towards a more specific survey on Tartini’s works and style, and I will no longer attempt to make general conclusions regarding the performance practice of the 18 thcentury violin repertoire. A general remark about this text: The regulations of the programme allow, or rather require, the research fellows to make their own choices in terms of the form and medium used for their reflections. In the case of the present work, the obvious thing to do was to assemble a text that accounts for the methods, sources and historical information I have used, in addition to the critical reflection. I have made efforts to produce a clear, <b>transparent</b> and unambiguous <b>text.</b> Hence, I have avoided the dreaded “International Art English”, which has been so widespread in the language of art criticism over the last two decades. Ideally, I would have preferred to present my reflections in the style of Tartini and his contemporaries. It is my belief that the famous treatises of C. P. E. Bach, Quantz, L. Mozart, Mattheson and others are indeed reflections, written by artists who described and discussed what was in fact their own art and practice. Their style of writing is remarkably clear and concise, usually economic in words and held in a surprisingly direct and oral language. As they humbly bow their wigs in the dust in their prefaces, they equally boldly boast their highly subjective opinions about music and the practice of other musicians in the following chapters of their books. As tempting as it would be to try to follow suit, I have only used it as a source of inspiration to my writing. This is, after all, a work of music, not one of literature. I must compel the reader {{to keep in mind that}} this is not a work of science, but of art. Therefore, this text does not meet the standards demanded of a scientific paper. However, as a work of art, my practice rests on an investigation of historical sources that requires a certain academic attitude, and the reflection is intertwined with the discussion of historical information. But the bottom line is that this work is not intended to be based exclusively on empirical data, but rather on the interaction between theory and practice...|$|R
