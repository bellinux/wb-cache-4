25|$|Technological {{change is}} a {{combination}} of more and of better technology. A 2011 study in the journal Science showed that the peak of the rate of change of the world's capacity to compute information was in 1998, when the world's <b>technological</b> <b>capacity</b> to compute information on general-purpose computers grew at 88% per year. Since then, technological change clearly has slowed. In recent times, every new year allowed humans to carry out roughly 160% of the computations that possibly could have been executed by all existing general-purpose computers in the year before. This still is exponential, but shows the varying nature of technological change.|$|E
25|$|It {{is likely}} that Brazil has {{retained}} the <b>technological</b> <b>capacity</b> and knowhow to produce and deliver a nuclear weapon. Experts at the Los Alamos National Laboratory have concluded that in view of its previous nuclear activities, Brazil {{is in a position}} to produce nuclear weapons within three years. If Brazil decided to pursue a nuclear weapon, the centrifuges at the Resende enrichment plant could be reconfigured to produce highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons. Even a small enrichment plant like Resende could produce several nuclear weapons per year, but only if Brazil was willing to do so openly.|$|E

25|$|While high {{performing}} Asian {{economies and}} the six oldest ASEAN members have invested heavily in public education at the primary and secondary levels, tertiary education has been left largely to the private sector. Tertiary education in Southeast Asia is, in general, relatively weak in terms of <b>technological</b> <b>capacity</b> and integration such as in credit transfer schemes. Singapore is highly focused on innovation {{while the rest of}} the region lags behind. In most cases, universities are focused on teaching and service to government rather than academic research. Universities in Southeast Asia, both in terms of academic salaries and research infrastructure (libraries, laboratories), tend to be poorly supported financially. Moreover, regional academic journals cater to their local audiences and respond less to international standards which makes universal or regional benchmarking difficult.|$|E

50|$|The {{growth of}} technologically {{mediated}} {{information has been}} quantified in different ways, including society's <b>technological</b> <b>capacity</b> to store information, to communicate information, and to compute information.

This is the informational equivalent of 60 CD-ROM per person in 2007 and represents a sustained annual growth rate of some 25%.

One portion of his work focuses on television’s emergence as an idea and practice in the late 19th Century, where Uricchio argues for a genealogy rooted in the telegraph and telephone rather than photography and film. This work, among other things, locates early television within emergent digital and acoustic technologies, and explores the interplay of ideas regarding presence with the period’s <b>technological</b> <b>capacities.</b> He shows that television as a concept preceded film as a medium, establishing a horizon of expectations that helps to account for film’s obsession with liveness during its first decade.|$|R
