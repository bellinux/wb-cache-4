5|$|In June 1911, Charlotte {{attended}} {{her cousin}} George V's coronation in England, but the country's summer heat left her bed-ridden with a swollen face and {{pain in her}} limbs. On 25 June 1914, her husband inherited his father's dukedom and became Bernhard III, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. World War I broke out on 28 July; Bernhard left for the front while Charlotte remained behind to oversee the duchy, serving mainly as a figurehead. During the war, Charlotte increasingly experienced various pains including chronic aches, swollen legs, and kidney problems. The degree of the pain became so severe <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>took</b> opium as her only comfortable treatment.|$|E
5|$|After {{school is}} over, Yumi's classmate Tsutako Takeshima meets with Yumi {{to show her}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>took</b> a {{photograph}} of Yumi's meeting with Sachiko earlier that morning. Yumi asks if she can have the photo, but Tsutako says she will give her the snapshot under two conditions: one being that Tsutako can display it at the upcoming school festival, and two being that Yumi get Sachiko's permission to do so as well. Yumi agrees to this, which sets in motion {{a series of events}} involving the entire Yamayuri Council. A few weeks after first meeting Sachiko, Yumi accepts Sachiko's rosary and therefore agrees to become her petite sœur. This officially inducts Yumi into the Yamayuri Council where she assists them in school matters alongside Yoshino Shimazu and Shimako Tōdō—the petite sœurs of Rei Hasekura and Sei Satō, respectively. Through her activities in the Yamayuri Council, Yumi becomes closer to the other members and generally finds her experiences with the group to be enjoyable.|$|E

Fromme {{is a member of the}} Manson Family, and was sentenced to life {{imprisonment}} for attempting to assassinate United States President Gerald Ford in 1975. Jenna and Danny begin arguing after the two are forced to share a dressing room. She takes down Danny's poster of the Montreal Alouettes, a Canadian Football League team based in Montreal, Quebec, which was signed by Marc Trestman, the head coach of the Alouettes. Jenna says <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>took</b> down the poster because it was tacky, as are his mother's chain e-mails (a message that attempts to induce the recipient to make a number of copies of the letter and then pass them on to as many recipients as possible).|$|E
5|$|Saint Kitts and Nevis sent seven {{athletes to}} the 2012 Summer Olympics. One athlete, the {{sprinter}} Tameka Williams, admitted prior to {{competing in the}} London Games <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>took</b> Blast Off Red, which is typically used to increase the performance of horses and greyhounds. It was announced on July 29 {{that she would not}} compete. Kim Collins, who has competed in every Olympics that Saint Kitts and Nevis has participated in, was not allowed to compete by his Olympic committee. Collins was required to stay in the Olympic village, but instead stayed with his wife (who was also his coach), closer to the track. The committee said he had violated team rules, and did not allow him to compete.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, George thinks Liz {{is breaking}} the rules by taking a personal call; he gets angry and wrestles the handset from her. Later, Andy is upset that he listened to Chloe in her final moments, and Liz, {{who has made a}} complaint about George's conduct, tells him <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>took</b> a call from an ex-soldier, in tears because his mother committed suicide following the death of her cat. Andy realises that the man's mother is the caller from the previous night. George advises that Andy will not face any repercussions, and asks Andy to help Michael, new to the centre, with his first call.

5|$|As Shaw grew older, his {{reputation}} as a dramatic actor grew stronger, and he became known for a sharp intelligence and dignified style. Although his good looks diminished, reviewers felt that he used his florid and weatherbeaten face well in evoking grandeur and self-assuredness in such roles as generals, priests and his familiar Shakespearean parts. In 1956, his wife Margaret Delamere died; she was survived by their daughter Drusilla. Shaw began a romantic relationship in the mid-1950s with Joan Ingpen, the well-known classical music and opera talent agent who had previously represented him. The two were romantically involved, to the point <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>took</b> his surname, until Shaw's death. During the 1980s, however, Shaw also had a brief relationship with Harriet Ravenscroft, the mother of the disc jockey John Peel, whom he met while performing at Ludlow Castle at Ludlow. He split his time between Ingpen and Ravenscroft on a four-day rotating basis to which both women consented. Although Peel got along with Shaw and said he made his mother happy, {{he said he did not}} feel comfortable with the arrangement. He felt it disrupted his mother's friendships and prospects for a more stable relationship.|$|E
5|$|From then on, Isabella used Castle Rising {{as one of}} {{her main}} residences until her death in 1358. Isabella was a wealthy woman, as the King granted her a yearly income of £3,000, which by 1337 had {{increased}} to £4,000. She enjoyed a regal lifestyle in Norfolk, maintaining minstrels, huntsmen and grooms, and received visits from Edward and the royal household on at least four occasions. Despite her large income, Isabella ran up long-standing debts with the local merchants near the castle. Around the time <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>took</b> over the castle, a new set of buildings were constructed in the central bailey, including a west range containing a residential suite, a new private chapel, and a south range linking to various service buildings; the existing kitchen was reused. The great hall was reroofed, although Isabella lived in the west range, using the keep only for formal occasions or as accommodation for very senior guests. A brick wall around the outside of the inner bailey may have been built around this time to provide additional security.|$|E

25|$|Mangammal was the {{daughter}} of Tupakula Lingama Nayaka, a general of Madurai ruler Chokkanatha Nayak (1659–1682). Although Chokkanatha married Mangammal early, she became the principal queen only later on after his efforts to wed {{the daughter}} of the Thanjavur ruler Vijayaraghava Nayaka had failed. Chokkanatha died in 1682, after <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>took</b> over the crown.|$|E

25|$|On 9 May 1976, Ulrike Meinhof {{was found}} dead in her prison cell, hanging from a rope made from jail towels. An {{investigation}} concluded that she had hanged herself, a result hotly contested at the time, triggering a plethora of so-called conspiracy theories. Other theories suggest <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>took</b> her life because she was being ostracized {{by the rest of the}} group. There is, however, evidence to the contrary of this hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|From May 24–26, 1960, Cobb {{met with}} Hermsdorf, who {{evaluated}} {{her at her}} hotel. Without mentioning the CIA, he offered her a long-term employment opportunity and invited her to meet him somewhere outside of Cuba. They arranged to meet at the Drake Hotel in New York on June 3. Cobb traveled to the United States in early June 1960. She also stopped in Washington, D.C., where she stayed at the Raleigh Hotel.

25|$|Jon Courtenay Grimwood's novel End of the World Blues {{features}} an Irish Bar in Tokyo called Pirate Mary's, named after O'Malley's (supposed) daughter Máirín Ni Mhaille.

25|$|The {{abduction}} {{episode of}} 1152 has been variously interpreted. It seems that Derbforgaill went willingly, and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>took</b> her cattle and chattels with her, {{all at the}} persuasion of her younger brother Maeleachlainn. It {{has been suggested that}} this was an attempt on the part of her paternal family, the royal family of Meath, to forge a new alliance through marriage, with Diarmait Mac Murchada. Formalising treaties through marriage seems to have been standard practice in twelfth-century Ireland, witness Diarmait Mac Murchada's betrothal of his daughter Aoife to Strongbow, while in 1165 the king of Uladh's daughter was taken hostage by the high king presumably just to prevent her father from using her to cement a new alliance.|$|E
25|$|Eliot {{arranged}} for a formal separation in February 1933, and thereafter shunned her entirely, hiding from her and instructing his friends– including members of the Bloomsbury Group and the publisher Faber & Faber, {{where he was a}} director– not to tell her where he was. Her brother had her committed to an asylum in 1938, after she was found wandering the streets of London at five o'clock in the morning, apparently asking whether Eliot had been beheaded. Apart from one escape attempt, she remained there until she died nine years later at the age of 58; she was said to have suffered a heart attack, although there is a suspicion <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>took</b> an overdose. Eliot won the Nobel Prize for Literature the following year.|$|E
