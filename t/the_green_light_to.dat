5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, all the cars lined up on the grid per FIA race procedure. As Charlie Whiting signalled <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> start the {{formation}} lap, a full field of twenty cars set off as normal for a single lap before forming the starting grid. At the banked Turn 13, the entrance to the pit lane (and the turn that was the centre of the controversy), all teams that ran Michelin tyres returned to their pits, leaving just six cars from the three Bridgestone teams (Ferrari, Jordan, and Minardi) to start the race.|$|E

The 30 Rock pilot {{focused on the}} boss of a variety show who must manage her relationships with the show's volatile star and its charismatic executive producer. The storyline evolved into one that dealt with a head writer of a variety show who dealt with both of the stars, {{as well as the}} show's new network executive. 30 Rock was officially given <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> air May 15, 2006, along with a 13-episode order.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) {{acquired}} the land containing the spring {{for the expansion}} of the nearby Sembawang Air Base, leaving F with less than 4 hectares (10 acres) of land. Its water-bottling plant survived until the early 1990s however. In January 2002, locals' interest to the hot spring, which had caught the attention of Singaporeans after the surrounding land had been cleared to begin the RSAF air base extension. Sembawang community leaders gathered signatures to petition Mindef, which was going to fence off the area, to preserve and develop the hot spring for the general public. Mindef gave <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> the appeals and opened a small side gate pavement for the public to access the spring.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A new {{approach}} for {{design and implementation}} of urban vehicle control system is proposed. The vehicle streams on lanes are considered similar with the streams of instructions in multitask programs. Real-time scheduling algorithms are used <b>to</b> allocate <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> phases. An adaptive component {{is used to calculate}} new vehicle flow parameters when a failure appears as a consequence of an accident. The real-time schedulers use the parameters to obtain new feasible resource allocations. ...|$|R

5|$|In January 2016, City Council Member Eric Ulrich, a Republican {{representing}} Ozone Park, {{came out}} against the plan as among other things, it prohibited left turns at Jamaica Avenue. He had been in favor of bus rapid transit along Woodhaven Boulevard, as he stated in a 2014 opinion editorial. The plan was modified in May 2016 {{in an effort to}} accommodate Ulrich's objections. It included restrictions on left-turns at only five intersections, including none at Jamaica Avenue. The left-turn restrictions were put into the plan to speed up travel times by eliminating the signal time allocated to split phasing—a traffic-signal setup where traffic in one direction has a green light, while the other directions of traffic have a red light, in order to allow drivers at <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> turn left without conflicts from oncoming traffic. The restrictions also reduce conflicts between turning vehicles and pedestrians. Instead of banning left turns at Jamaica Avenue, the left turn bays would be re-engineered around the BMT Jamaica Line subway columns to decrease blind spots and collisions. Local community members were also opposed to the plan due to the reduction of traffic lanes along the boulevard's service roads from two lanes to a single lane.|$|E

6000|$|... "Then {{there were}} other matters of untruth. That, for instance, of the ermine collar {{embroidered}} with emeralds. If an understandable reason be required for this, {{it would be to}} draw attention away from <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>lights</b> which were seen in the room, and especially in the well-hole. Any unprejudiced person would accept <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> eyes of a great snake, such as tradition pointed to living in the well-hole. In fine, therefore, Lady Arabella wanted the general belief to be that there was no snake of the kind in Diana's Grove. For my own part, I don't believe in a partial liar--this art does not deal in veneer; a liar is a liar right through. Self-interest may prompt falsity of the tongue; but if one prove to be a liar, nothing that he says can ever be believed. This leads us to the conclusion that because she said or inferred that there was no snake, we should look for one--and expect to find it, too.|$|R

25|$|After {{waging a}} {{tremendous}} qualifying battle with Schumacher on Saturday and securing a front-row starting position, Häkkinen dug himself a hole {{on a cool}} but sunny race day: first, he slid off the track into the guardrail {{at the end of}} the infield straight in the morning warm-up, damaging his McLaren's suspension and requiring a heroic job by his crew to get the car ready to race. Three hours later, he learned that his failure to wait for <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> begin the warm-up session had caused his best qualifying lap to be taken away, dropping him from second to fourth position on the grid.|$|E

5000|$|When {{using the}} Apple Watch, some users have {{reported}} issues using the heart monitoring feature due to permanent skin conditions including tattoos. The Watch uses photoplethysmography technology (PPG) which utilizes <b>the</b> <b>green</b> LED <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> measure heart rates. To gauge a user's heart rate, <b>the</b> watch flashes <b>green</b> <b>light</b> from <b>the</b> LEDs at {{the skin and}} records the amount of this light that is absorbed by the red pigment of the blood. However, under certain circumstances the skin may not allow for the <b>light</b> absorption <b>to</b> be read properly and thus provide inaccurate results.|$|R

25|$|Before Luas was launched, it was {{feared that}} the tram system {{would lead to a}} high number of fatal accidents. So far, however, there have been only four fatalities. There have been many occurrences of cars {{striking}} trams, mainly caused by motorists breaking red lights. On 16 September 2009, a Luas collided with a Dublin Bus on the O'Connell Street-Abbey Street Junction. 22 people were injured in the collision, 3 seriously, including the tram driver. Early investigations suggested that the bus had <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> move, and that the Luas must have had technical problems. The Luas driver was later charged with dangerous driving causing harm and operating a tram in a manner which posed risk to others. He was subsequently acquitted of dangerous conduct by the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court.|$|E
25|$|In Game 1 neither team scored {{until the}} 5th inning when Jed Lowrie of the Red Sox hit a {{sacrifice}} fly that scored a run from 3rd base. Red Sox starter Daisuke Matsuzaka held a no-hitter through six innings until a hit by Carl Crawford ended that bid with a leadoff hit in the 7th inning. Following Crawford's base hit, Cliff Floyd would single, advancing Crawford to a scoring position. The Rays however, could not capitalize as the next three batters were retired to end the inning. In the 8th inning, Kevin Youkilis hit a fly ball to left field for the Red Sox, which went {{off the end of}} Carl Crawford's glove, scoring Dustin Pedroia from 1st base and giving the Red Sox a 2–0 lead. The 8th inning for the Rays saw the first two batter reach base to send Carlos Peña to the plate with none out. With three balls and no strikes, Rays manager Joe Maddon gave Pena <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> swing away, a move which would backfire as Peña flew out to Right Field. Evan Longoria then grounded into an inning ending double play. The Red Sox would hold on to their lead and shut out the Rays by a score of 2–0, taking {{the first game of the}} series.|$|E

50|$|The {{success of}} Line 1 as a turnkey project {{acquired}} from Siemens with 100% imported electromechanical equipment prompted {{a wave of}} similar proposals from twelve other cities in mainland China {{toward the end of}} the 1990s. The fever for import-centric rapid transit caused the State Planning Committee to temporarily halt approval of rapid transit projects nationwide and regulate the localisation rates of rolling stock suppliers. Amid tightened regulation, only Line 2 of Guangzhou Metro received <b>the</b> immediate <b>green</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> proceed in June 1998 on the condition that at least 60% of its electromechanical equipment must be sourced domestically.|$|R
