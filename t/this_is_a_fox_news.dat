50|$|The {{archipelago}} {{had only}} one terrestrial mammal upon the arrival of Europeans, the Falkland Islands wolf (also known as warrah). <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> kind of <b>fox,</b> and was found on both major islands. It was traditionally thought that Patagonian Indians once brought the warrah to the islands as a hunting dog. However, a 2009 DNA study by scientists at UCLA suggested that the warrah arrived on the islands long before humans migrated to the New World, possibly {{during one of the}} particularly intense cold intervals 340,000 years ago, 150,000 years ago or 25,000 years ago. Its nearest relative was the maned wolf, an extant South American canid. It became extinct in the mid-19th century as human settlement spread. 14 species of marine mammals including killer whales, Peale's dolphins, Commerson's dolphins, leopard seals, southern elephant seals, and southern sea lions frequent the surrounding waters. The elephant seal, the fur seal, and the sea lions all breed on the islands, and the largest elephant seal breeding site has over 500 animals in it. Other species, especially cetaceans, are also sometimes seen. Populations of large whales, drastically reduced by illegal whaling carried out by the Soviet Union until the late 1970s, are now recovering. These include southern right whales, humpback whales, blue whales, fin whales, sei whales, and sperm whales.|$|R
