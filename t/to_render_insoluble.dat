Studies with mined clays and single adsorbates have shown that polar compounds and non–ionic compounds are adsorbed on clay, particularly on the basal surfaces of expanding clays. Polyuronide is usually negatively adsorbed by sodium montmorillonite, but quite strongly adsorbed when aluminum ions were present on the exchange complex. The Harmattan dust and humin sample in which most of the organic material were removed by extraction with NaOH solutions were examined by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). Samples heated to 300 °C and 1000 °C were also used believing that heating would be expected to remove organic material. Surface studies of the dust have shown that much of the surface of the particles is covered by an organic layer...|$|R

40|$|Direct and {{indirect}} effects of microorganisms on technetium insolubilization in water covering waterlogged soils were studied. Seven soils were waterlogged {{and then the}} water covering the soils were collected for further tracer experiments. The samples in contact with air were incubated with 95 mTcO 4 [...] at 25 C for 4 to 5 days. After incubation, the samples were sequentially separated into four fractions: one insoluble fraction (> 0. 2 {micro}m) and three soluble fractions (TcO 4 -, cationic, and other forms). The radioactivity of 95 mTc in each fraction was measured with a NaI (Tl) scintillation counter. The insolubility of Tc was observed in the untreated samples. The maximum insolubilization radioactivity was 37 % of the total radioactivity in P 38, which was collected from a paddy field, gray lowland soil. Microscopic observations revealed that bacteria were the dominant species in the insoluble fraction of P 38. For the other samples, less than 9 % of the Tc was found in insoluble form. In order to clarify biological and nonbiological factor affecting the insolubility, a reducing agent or nutrients {{were added to the}} P 38 sample. The amount of insoluble Tc was enhanced by the addition of nutrients, while the addition of the reducing agent resulted in a dramatic decrease in the amount of the insoluble Tc. Most of the 95 mTcO 4 - added to the filtered or autoclaved samples was present {{in the form of the}} pertechnetate anion, even in P 38. The filtered and autoclaved samples contained metabolites and dead cell particles, respectively. These materials, therefore, did not affect the physicochemical changes in Tc. These results suggest that specific bacteria having the ability <b>to</b> <b>render</b> Tc <b>insoluble</b> even under not strictly anaerobic conditions directly contribute to the insolubility of Tc...|$|R

"December 2011 "Includes bibliographical references. Osteoporosis is a worldwide burden affecting over 200 million people. There are many risk factors associated with osteoporosis, but they all lead to decreased bone strength and an increased chance of bone fracture. The field of tissue engineering could be used to create bone substitute materials that can increase bone strength or promote new bone growth. Collagen and hyaluronic acid (HA) are particularly interesting due to their roles in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of humans and their ability to stimulate bone forming cells. These materials can be processed into nanofiber scaffolds using a technique called electrospinning; a process that applies high voltage to a polymer solution to draw out nanofibers that are collected on a ground plate. An electrospinning solution of collagen/HA was synthesized, and the electrospinning apparatus was adjusted to generate uniform nanofiber meshes with consistent nanofiber diameter. The meshes were then crosslinked <b>to</b> <b>render</b> them <b>insoluble</b> in aqueous solutions, and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were conjugated to the surface to promote cellular in-growth. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was utilized to image the nanofiber mesh surface and electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was used to quantify the charged particles on the mesh as gold. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to find the absorption spectrum and bonding changes after each step. A WST- 1 assay was also performed to determine the potential biocompatibility. The results show {{that it was possible to}} develop scaffolds that were insoluble in aqueous solutions and promoted cellular attachment and proliferation. In conclusion, nanofiber meshes made from collagen/HA could be utilized as a tissue engineered scaffold to promote bone growth...|$|R

40|$|The {{polysaccharide}} ulvan, {{composed of}} sulphated rhamnose, glucoronic and iduronic acids {{was used to}} produce polymeric membranes by solvent casting. As ulvan is soluble in water, a cross-linking step was necessary <b>to</b> <b>render</b> the membrane <b>insoluble</b> in water and stable at physiological conditions. Crosslinked ulvan membranes were characterized by FTIR, SEM, swelling behaviour was investigated and the mechanical performance assessed by quasi-static tensile testing. Furthermore, the ability and mechanism of sustained release of a model drug from ulvan membranes was investigated. Produced membranes revealed remarkable ability to uptake water (up to ∼ 1800 % of its initial dry weight) and increased mechanical performance (1. 76 MPa) related with cross-linking. On the other hand, medicated ulvan dressings demonstrate the potential as drug delivery devices. Using a model drug we have observed an initial steady release of the drug – of nearly 49 % – followed by slower and sustained release up to 14 days. The properties of ulvan membranes herein revealed suggest a great potential of this natural sulphated polysaccharide as a wound dressing.

40|$|Cellulose acetate and {{cellulose}} nitrate are the important constituents of airplane dopes in {{use at the}} present time, but planes were treated with other materials in the experimental stages of flying. The above compounds belong to the class of colloids and are of value because they produce a shrinking action on the fabric when drying out of solution, rendering it drum tight. Other colloids possessing the same property have been proposed and tried. In the first stages {{of the development of}} dope, however, shrinkage was not considered. The fabric was treated merely <b>to</b> <b>render</b> it waterproof. The first airplanes constructed were covered with cotton fabric stretched as tightly as possible over the winds, fuselage, etc., and flying was possible only in fine weather. The necessity of an airplane which would fly under all weather conditions at once became apparent. Then followed experiments with rubberized fabrics, fabrics treated with glue <b>rendered</b> <b>insoluble</b> by formaldehyde or bichromate, fabrics treated with drying and nondrying oils, shellac, casein, etc. It was found that fabrics treated as above lost their tension in damp weather, and the oil from the motor penetrated the proofing material and weakened the fabric. For the most part the film of material lacked durability. Cellulose nitrate lacquers, however were found to be more satisfactory under varying weather conditions, added less weight to the planes, and were easily applied.

5000|$|A United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{environmental}} impact statement finds that streams near some valley fills from mountaintop removal contain higher levels of minerals {{in the water and}} decreased aquatic biodiversity. Mine-affected streams also have high selenium concentrations, which can bioaccumulate and produce toxic effects (e.g., reproductive failure, physical deformity, mortality), and these effects have been documented in reservoirs below streams. Because of higher pH balances in mine-affected streams, metals such as selenium and iron hydroxide are <b>rendered</b> <b>insoluble,</b> bringing attendant chemical changes to the stream. [...] The statement also estimates that 724 mi of Appalachian streams were buried by valley fills between 1985 and 2001. On September 28, 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) independent Science Advisory Board (SAB) released their first draft review of EPA’s research into the water quality impacts of valley fills associated with mountaintop mining, agreeing with EPA’s conclusion that valley fills are associated with increased levels of conductivity threatening aquatic life in surface waters.|$|R

40|$|The {{translocation}} of {{a unique}} facilitative glucose transporter isoform (GLUT 4) from an intracellular site to the plasma membrane accounts for the large insulin-dependent increase in glucose transport observed in muscle and adipose tissue. The intracellular location of GLUT 4 in the basal state and the pathway by which it reaches the cell surface upon insulin stimulation are unclear. Here, we have examined the colocalization of GLUT 4 with the transferrin receptor, a protein which is known to recycle through the endosomal system. Using an anti-GLUT 4 monoclonal antibody we immunoisolated a vesicular fraction from an intracellular membrane fraction of 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes that contained > 90 % of the immunoreactive GLUT 4 found in this fraction, but only 40 % of the transferrin receptor (TfR). These results suggest only a limited degree of colocalization of these proteins. Using a technique <b>to</b> cross-link and <b>render</b> <b>insoluble</b> ("ablate') intracellular compartments containing the TfR {{by means of a}} transferrin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Tf-HRP), we further examined the relationship between the endosomal recycling pathway and the intracellular compartment containing GLUT 4 in these cells. Incubation of non-stimulated cells with Tf-HRP for 3 h at 37 degrees C resulted in quantitative ablation of the intracellular TfR, GLUT 1 and mannose- 6 -phosphate receptor and a shift in the density of Rab 5 -positive membranes. In contrast, only 40 % of intracellular GLUT 4 was ablated under the same conditions. Ablation was specific for the endosomal system as there was no significant ablation of either TGN 38 or lgp 120, which are markers for the trans Golgi reticulum and lysosomes respectively. Subcellular fractionation analysis revealed that most of the ablated pools of GLUT 4 and TfR were found in the intracellular membrane fraction. The extent of ablation of GLUT 4 from the intracellular fraction was unchanged in cells which were insulin-stimulated prior to ablation, whereas GLUT 1 exhibited increased ablation in insulin-stimulated cells. Pretreatment of adipocytes with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of Type-I and -IIa phosphatases, increased GLUT 4 ablation in the presence of insulin, consistent with okadaic acid increasing the internalization of GLUT 4 from the plasma membrane under these conditions. Using a combination of subcellular fractionation, vesicle immunoadsorption and compartment ablation using the Tf-HRP conjugate {{we have been able to}} resolve overlapping but distinct intracellular distributions of the TfR and GLUT 4 in adipocytes. At least three separate compartments were identified: TfR-positive/GLUT 4 -negative. TfR-negative/GLUT 4 -positive, and TfR-positive/GLUT 4 -positive, as defined by the relative abundance of these two markers. We propose that the TfR-negative/GLUT 4 -positive compartment, which contains approximately 60 % of the intracellular GLUT 4, represents a specialized intracellular compartment that is withdrawn from the endosomal system. The biosynthesis and characteristics of this compartment may be fundamental to the unique insulin regulation of GLUT 4...|$|R

40|$|Thymocytes {{incubated}} {{with either}} ATP or GTP exhibit {{a brief period}} of enhanced DNA synthesis in contrast to the prolonged period of enhanced synthesis observed when thymocytes were incubated with concanavalin A. The cells responding to nucleotides represent a sub-population of theta antigen-bearing T cells comprising approximately 2 % of the total thymocyte population as judged by a combined immunofluorescent/autoradiographic analysis. Thymocytes responsive to ATP and GTP are sensitive to cortisone suggesting that they are relatively immature T cells. ATP-responsive cells also preferentially aggregate with immature T cells when incubated with peanut agglutinin. GTP-responsive cells, on the other hand, do not. Nucleotides <b>rendered</b> <b>insoluble</b> by linkage <b>to</b> agarose via the ribose moiety are more active mitogenically at lower concentrations than either soluble nucleotides or even nucleotides linked to agarose via the nucleic acid base.
