40|$|Abstract: Material {{electromagnetic}} muldistribution {{of large}} rotors poses a potential hazard {{to the operation}} of rotary machine and interferes the vibration monitoring. These variations of electromagnetic property of material are scaled as electrical runout, which is necessary to be controlled in manufacturing process. A method of offsetting transducer difference for detecting electrical runout online is {{presented in this paper}} through finite element analysis, and the corresponding measurement system is developed for large air compressor rotors. A beam of laser with triangulation method is used to measure the surface position of the revolving rotor, which can be transformed as the non-contact distance. In the condition of static sensor probe, rotating centerline and rotary measured points on surface, actual runout of rotor is calculated through signal obtained from laser triangulation measurement. In this way, eddy current sensor, which is posed in the same plane of measuring cross profile with laser device, detects both actual runout and electrical runout as output of <b>total</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>runout.</b> Analyzing two signals through adjusting the phases of cross profile and offsetting the actual runout, electrical runout can be indicated in the process of lathe working. This measurement capability is useful in predicting the vibration level in the slow roll testing before product delivery. At last, the measuring experiment is performed to verify the accuracy of the system. Copyright © 2013 IFSA...|$|E

Wrather was acquired in late September 1987 by a new company formed as an equal partnership between the Walt Disney Company and Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd. of Hong Kong (IEP). IEP itself was controlled by Ronald Brierley and had already amassed 28% of the approximately 10.1 million publicly-traded shares of Wrather Corporation.

40|$|Abstract—Rotating {{stages in}} semiconductor, display {{industry}} {{and many other}} fields require challenging accuracy to perform their functions properly. Especially, Axis of rotation error on rotary system is significant; such as the spindle error motion of the aligner, wire bonder and inspector machine which result in the poor state of manufactured goods. To evaluate and improve the performance of such precision rotary stage, unessential movements on the other 5 degrees of freedom of the rotary stage must be measured and analyzed. In this paper, we have measured the three translations and two tilt motions of a rotating stage with high precision capacitive sensors. To obtain the radial error motion from T. I. R (<b>Total</b> <b>Indicated</b> Reading) of radial direction, we have used Donaldson’s reversal technique. And the axial components of the spindle tilt error motion can be obtained accurately from the axial direction outputs of sensors by Estler face motion reversal technique. Further more we have defined and measured the sensitivity of positioning error to the five error motions.
