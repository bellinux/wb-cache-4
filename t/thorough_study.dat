They distributed questionnaires to program participants, reviewed the White Stag literature, and observed {{the program in}} action. They also conducted a statistical analysis of troops taking part in White Stag and compared them to non-participating units. In December 1965, Chief Scout Executive Joseph Brunton received the White Stag Report. It stated that offering leadership development to youth was a unique opportunity for Scouting to provide a practical benefit to youth and would add substantial support to Scouting's character development goals. It recommended that Wood Badge {{should be used to}} experiment with the leadership development principles of White Stag. The program had until this time taught the adults the same Scoutcraft skills a boy was required to learn to become a First Class Scout along with concepts of the patrol method.|$|E
5|$|Prussian {{losses are}} more controversial: Frederick boasted of {{negligible}} casualties. In his <b>thorough</b> <b>study</b> of regimental histories, Bodart counted 169–170 Prussian dead (including seven officers), and 430 wounded (including Prince Henry, Seydlitz {{and two other}} generals, and 19 officers), or about 2.4% of the total Prussian force; these casualties amount to less than 10% of the engaged Prussian force. Other recent sources agree that the Prussians lost as few as 300 {{and as many as}} 500 among the wounded. In an assessment of surviving regimental records, modern sources place Prussian losses at even fewer than Bodart did: one colonel was killed, plus two other officers, and 67 soldiers.|$|E

25|$|Virginia and Truckee Railway Motor Car 22, {{also called}} McKeen Motor Car 70, is a {{gasoline-powered}} railcar at the Nevada State Railroad Museum in Carson City in the U.S. state of Nevada. It {{was built for}} the Virginia and Truckee Railroad in 1910 by the McKeen Motor Car Company. Motor Car 22 was operated by the Virginia and Truckee until 1945, when it was sold off and became a diner until 1955. It eventually became the office and storage space for a plumbing business before it was donated to the Nevada State Railroad Museum in 1995. After a <b>thorough</b> <b>study,</b> the Museum undertook a restoration of the McKeen car in 1997. The restored motor car was unveiled in 2010, a century after it was originally delivered to the Virginia and Truckee.

25|$|In the mid-1930s, Pauling, {{strongly}} influenced by the biologically oriented funding priorities of the Rockefeller Foundation's Warren Weaver, decided to strike out into new areas of interest. Although Pauling's early interest had focused almost exclusively on inorganic molecular structures, he had occasionally thought about molecules of biological importance, {{in part because of}} Caltech's growing strength in biology. Pauling interacted with such great biologists as Thomas Hunt Morgan, Theodosius Dobzhanski, Calvin Bridges and Alfred Sturtevant. His early work in this area included studies of the structure of hemoglobin with his student Charles D. Coryell. He demonstrated that the hemoglobin molecule changes structure when it gains or loses an oxygen atom. As a result of this observation, he decided to conduct a more <b>thorough</b> <b>study</b> of protein structure in general. He returned to his earlier use of X-ray diffraction analysis. But protein structures were far less amenable to this technique than the crystalline minerals of his former work. The best X-ray pictures of proteins in the 1930s had been made by the British crystallographer William Astbury, but when Pauling tried, in 1937, to account for Astbury's observations quantum mechanically, he could not.|$|E

25|$|A {{few years}} later he formed part of a politico-commercial {{expedition}} to Constantinople to establish business relations with Turkey, Poland, and Russia. After a quick trip to Cuba in 1787, he was chosen by Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra {{to go to the}} Pacific Coast of Mexico and the naval base of San Blas, the headquarters for the exploration of the Pacific Northwest. He was a Frigate Lieutenant (Teniente de Fragata) at the time. Alongside went his brother-in-law, Francisco de Eliza, who would distinguish himself as Governor of Fort San Miguel on Vancouver Island's Nootka Sound. On their ship to Mexico was the recently named Viceroy of New Spain, Don Juan Vicente de Güemes Padilla Horcasitas y Aguayo, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo. On February 3, 1790, Caamaño took part on an expedition to the Pacific Northwest. He was commanding the Nuestra Señora del Rosario (also known as the La Princesa), a 189-ton frigate built in San Blas for the exploration of the North. He did not go beyond Nootka on this voyage, but on his next one, in 1792, came as far as Bucareli Bay commanding the frigate Aránzazu, a corvette built at Cavite in the Philippines. By this time he had been promoted to Ship Lieutenant (Teniente de Navío). This expedition did a <b>thorough</b> <b>study</b> of the coast from Bucareli to Nootka, marking the map of Alaska and British Columbia with many names which are there today. Sailing from Nootka on June 13, 1792, Caamaño explored Bucareli Bay, off Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, and anchored in Dixon Entrance on July 20. Then he explored southward, passing through Principe Channel, Nepean Sound, Whale Sound, near the Estevan Group archipelago, then into Caamaño Sound and south through Laredo Channel, between Aristazabal Island and Princess Royal Island, returning to Nootka on September 7, 1792. He named Principe Channel, Laredo Channel, Campania Island, Campania Sound, Aristazabal Island, and Gil Island. George Vancouver adopted these names for his chart.|$|E
