5|$|Kogălniceanu was a {{democratic}} and nationalist politician who combined liberalism {{with the conservative}} principles acquired during his education, taking inspiration from {{the policies of the}} Prussian statesmen Baron vom und zum Stein and Karl August von Hardenberg. German statesmen were however disinclined to consider him one of their own: Bernhard von Bülow <b>took</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> rumors that he was an agent of the Russians, and further alleged that the Romanian land reform was a sham.|$|E
5|$|The restorers <b>took</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> {{that all}} of the layers of grease and soot on the ceiling were the result of candle smoke. Contrary to this view, James Beck and {{numerous}} artists have suggested that Michelangelo used carbon black in a wash of glue to lay on shadows and crisp dark definition, a secco. If this is the case, then the greater part was removed in the restoration.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{hold that}} the Roman satirises native Scottish society. Soumilloit is wealthy enough {{to own a}} fortress, but he is low-born and the fortress is made only of wood. Moreover, his son Fergus works on the farm. Fergus' character is stumbling. Although valiant, he frequently transgresses the etiquette that the Francophone aristocratic society <b>took</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted.</b>|$|E

25|$|Calvin sees Dr. Berger as {{the events}} of the recent past have caused him to begin to doubt many things he once <b>took</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted,</b> leading to a midlife crisis. This leads to strain in his {{marriage}} as he finds Beth increasingly cold and distant, while she in turn believes he is overly concerned about Conrad {{to the point of being}} manipulated. Finally the friction becomes enough that Beth decides to leave him at the novel's conclusion. Father and son, however, have closed the gap between them.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, R.A. Zimbardo {{viewed the}} play {{as full of}} symbols. The Moon and its phases alluded to in the play, in his view, stand for {{permanence}} in mutability. The play uses the principle of discordia concors in several of its key scenes. Theseus and Hippolyta represent marriage and, symbolically, the reconciliation of the natural seasons or the phases of time. Hippolyta's story arc is that she must submit to Theseus and become a matron. Titania has {{to give up her}} motherly obsession with the changeling boy and passes through a symbolic death, and Oberon has to once again woo and win his wife. Kehler notes that Zimbardo <b>took</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> the female subordination within the obligatory marriage, social views that were already challenged in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The Rumford {{fireplace}} {{created a}} sensation in 1796 when Benjamin Thompson Rumford introduced {{the idea of}} restricting the chimney opening to increase the updraught. Rumford fireplaces were common from 1796, when Benjamin Rumford first wrote about them, until about 1850. Thomas Jefferson had them built at Monticello, and Henry David Thoreau listed them among the modern conveniences that everyone <b>took</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted.</b> Rumford and his workers changed fireplaces by inserting bricks into the hearth to make the side walls angled and added a choke to the chimney {{to increase the speed}} of air going up the flue. It produced a streamlined air flow, reducing turbulence so the smoke would go up into the chimney rather than choking the residents. Rumford fireplaces are appreciated for their tall classic elegance and heating efficiency. This simple alteration in the design of fireplaces were copied everywhere in an age when fires were the principal source of heat. The Rumford fireplace is still used in the 21st century.|$|E

25|$|Asquith led {{a deeply}} divided Liberal Party as Prime Minister, not least on {{questions}} of foreign relations and defence spending. Under Balfour, Britain and France had agreed upon the Entente Cordiale. In 1906, {{at the time the}} Liberals took office, there was an ongoing crisis between France and Germany over Morocco, and the French asked for British help in the event of conflict. Grey, the Foreign Secretary, refused any formal arrangement, but gave it as his personal opinion that in the event of war Britain would aid France. France then asked for military conversations aimed at co-ordination in such an event. Grey agreed, and these went on in the following years, without cabinet knowledge—Asquith most likely did not know of them until 1911. When he learned of them, Asquith was concerned that the French <b>took</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> British aid in the event of war, but Grey persuaded him the talks must continue.|$|E
500|$|Warner's {{decision}} to sell {{came at a}} time when he was losing the formidable power that he once <b>took</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted.</b> [...] He had already survived the dislocations of the 1950s, when other studio heads – including Louis B. Mayer, David O. Selznick, and Samuel Goldwyn – were pushed out by stockholders who [...] "sought scapegoats for dwindling profits". [...] Structural changes that occurred in the industry during this period ensured that studios would become [...] "more important as backers of independent producers than as creators of their own films", a situation that left little room for the traditional movie mogul. By the mid-1960s, most of the film moguls from the Golden Age of Hollywood had died, and Warner was regarded as one of the last of a dying breed. Evidence of Warner's eroding control at Warner Bros. included his failure to block production of the controversial but highly influential film, Bonnie and Clyde, a film project he initially [...] "hated". [...] Similarly, as producer of the film adaptation of Camelot, Warner was unable to persuade director Joshua Logan to cast Richard Burton and Julie Andrews in the leading roles. [...] Instead, Logan selected Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave, a move that contributed to the project's critical – [...] and commercial – failure. Another factor was that Logan was able to manipulate Warner's ego to persuade him from cutting the screenplay's length, despite the fact that the studio executive had already agreed with the film's unofficial producer, Joel Freeman, that it was overlong. [...] Warner officially retired from his studio in 1969.|$|E

For Bion, thoughts exist prior {{to the development of}} an apparatus for thinking. The apparatus for thinking, the capacity to have thoughts [...] "has to be called into existence to cope with thoughts" [...] (1967, p.111). Thoughts exist prior to their realization. Thinking, the capacity to think the thoughts which already exist, develops through another mind providing α-function (1962, p.83)—through the [...] "container" [...] role of maternal reverie.|$|E

2500|$|This {{does not}} reject {{the claim that}} Russia played an {{aggressive}} role in the East, which it did; rather, it means that Russia unwisely calculated that Japan would not go to war against its far larger and seemingly superior navy and army. Nicholas held the Japanese in contempt as [...] "yellow monkeys", and he <b>took</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that the Japanese would simply yield {{in the face of}} Russia's superior power, which thus explains his unwillingness to compromise. Evidence of Russia's false sense of security and superiority to Japan is seen by Russian reference to Japan choosing war as a big mistake.|$|E
2500|$|Diamandy {{also had}} a meeting with Raymond Poincaré, the President of France. He may have {{informed}} him about Radoslavov's promises, which Diamandy still <b>took</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted,</b> and which may explain Poincaré's overly confident support for Romania in later Entente conferences. However, the talk also covered the issue of Romania's grievances toward Russia, which still prevented her for entering the war. He introduced this enigma to Poincaré: [...] "Romania looks forward to France's victory and to Russia's defeat" [...] (see Franco-Russian Alliance). At one of the banquets in his honor, Diamandy divulged the existence of a parallel Franco–Romanian alliance, and stressed [...] "that Rmania's entry into the war would result in the conflict's end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Criticism of {{the play}} in {{the first decades of}} the 18th century {{continued}} to be dominated by the neoclassical conception of plot and character. Even the many critics who defended Hamlet <b>took</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> the necessity of the classical canon in principle. Voltaire's attack on the play is perhaps the most famous neoclassical treatment {{of the play}}; it inspired numerous defenses in England, but these defenses did not at first weaken the neoclassical orthodoxy. Thus Lewis Theobald explained the seeming absurdity of Hamlet's calling death an [...] "undiscovered country" [...] not long after he has encountered the Ghost by hypothesizing that the Ghost describes Purgatory, not death. Thus William Popple (in 1735) praises the verisimilitude of Polonius's character, deploring the actors' tradition of playing him only as a fool. Both Joseph Addison and Richard Steele praised particular scenes: Steele the psychological insight of the first soliloquy, and Addison the ghost scene.|$|E

2500|$|Hermannus Contractus (1013–1054) {{was among}} the {{earliest}} Christian scholars to estimate the circumference of Earth with Eratosthenes' method. Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), {{the most important and}} widely taught theologian of the Middle Ages, believed in a spherical Earth; and he even <b>took</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> his readers also knew the Earth is round. In his Summa Theologica he wrote, [...] "The physicist proves the earth to be round by one means, the astronomer by another: for the latter proves this by means of mathematics, e.g. by the shapes of eclipses, or something of the sort; while the former proves it by means of physics, e.g. by the movement of heavy bodies towards the center, and so forth." [...] Lectures in the medieval universities commonly advanced evidence in favor of the idea that the Earth was a sphere. Also, [...] "On the Sphere of the World", the most influential astronomy textbook of the 13th century and required reading by students in all Western European universities, described the world as a sphere.|$|E
2500|$|On {{his return}} to Germany in 1895 Goltz became a lieutenant-general and {{commander}} of the 5th Division, and in 1898, head of the Engineer and Pioneer Corps and Inspector-General of Fortifications. In 1900 he was made General of Infantry and in 1902 commander of the I. Army Corps. After returning to Germany in 1895, Goltz was {{in close contact with}} his students, and offered them his advice. In a 1899 letter to Colonel Pertev Beyone, one of his protégés, Goltz wrote: [...] "All the hopes of Turkey rest on her youth, the generation to which you belong, and which can save the country, once it reaches the top." [...] Goltz often expressed admiration for the ordinary Turkish soldier, whom he regarded as immensely tough, brave and willing to suffer without complaint. By contrast, Goltz had nothing but contempt for the young people in Germany, who he charged were being [...] "corrupted" [...] by hedonism, urbanization, industrialization, prosperity, liberalism and Social Democracy, something that he believed was rendering the next generation of Germans increasing unfit for the test of war. In articles he published in Germany on the Macedonian Question in the early 20th century, Goltz was very pro-Ottoman, saying that the Ottomans had every right to remain in Macedonia. In his letters to his Ottoman protégés, he often urged them to invade Bulgaria to punish the Bulgarian government for its support of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization. An Anglophobe, Goltz believed that the great coming war of the new 20th century would be an inevitable Anglo-German war for world domination. Goltz <b>took</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that the world was too small for the British and German empires to share, and one or the other would have to go. Starting in 1899, Goltz wrote to his Ottoman protégés, asking them to start preparing plans for invading Egypt to take the Suez Canal and for invading Persia as the prelude for an invasion of India. Goltz also believed that the European era of dominance would come to a close in the 20th century, pointing to the rise of new powers like the United States, Japan and eventually China. Goltz was greatly impressed with Japan’s victory in the Russian-Japanese war, and saw it as confirming his theory that in war, it is ultimately the will to win that makes the difference with the side with the stronger will always prevailing. In contrast to the anti-Asian racist [...] "Yellow Peril" [...] propaganda being offered by his own government, Goltz had considerable respect for Asian peoples, and wrote in 1905 to Pertev: [...] "The East is beginning to awake; once it is awakened, it will not go to sleep again." [...] Stressing that these were his own views, not those of the German government, Goltz speculated that sometime in the future a war would begin between the [...] "yellow race" [...] of the Japanese, Chinese and Mongols against the [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] powers, the United States and Great Britain. Goltz argued that neither Germany nor the Ottoman Empire could remain indifferent to this war, and it was necessary that Germany learn to understand [...] "the rising peoples of East Asia." [...] Goltz concluded his letter to Pertev: [...] "Since we will engage much more in the East in the future, it would be sensible to learn the special power…given to them by nature." ...|$|E
