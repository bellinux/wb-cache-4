25|$|Vytautas {{remained}} in prison until fall 1382. He {{managed to escape}} with help from his wife Anna, who received permission to visit her husband. According to different sources Vytautas exchanged clothes with either Anna or one of her female servants and sneaked out undetected. First he sought help from his sister Danutė and her husband Janusz I of Warsaw, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia. Eventually he came to his enemies, the Teutonic Knights, asking for protection and military aid against Jogaila. According to Wigand of Marburg, Birutė, mother of Vytautas, was drowned in Brest, likely {{in response to his}} escape. Two of her relatives, Vidimantas and Butrimas, were also murdered.|$|E
25|$|In the {{afternoon}} Ribault crossed over with eight gentlemen and was entertained by Menéndez. The French accepted some wine and preserves; {{but would not}} take more, knowing the fate of their companions. Then Ribault, pointing to the bodies of his comrades, which were visible from where he stood, said {{that they might have}} been tricked into the belief that Fort Caroline was taken, referring to a story he had heard from a barber who had survived the first massacre by feigning death when he was struck down, and had then escaped. But Ribault was soon convinced of his mistake, for he was allowed to converse privately with two Frenchmen captured at Fort Caroline. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Menéndez and asked again for ships with which to return to France. The Spaniard was unyielding, and Ribault returned to his companions to acquaint them with the results of the interview.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, the Afghans {{specifically}} {{identified two}} Al-Qaeda safe houses in Manshera, a town just miles from Abbottabad, {{leading them to}} believe that Bin Laden was possibly hiding there. But Amrullah Saleh says that Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf angrily smashed his fist on a table when Saleh presented the information to him during a meeting in which Afghan President Hamid Karzai also took part.

500|$|On September 27, 1979, Yankovic {{received}} a type-written note from Dr. Demento informing him that [...] "My Bologna" [...] was a smash hit {{on his radio}} show, and that Capitol Records had contacted the station, requesting {{a copy of the}} spoof for The Knack themselves. Later, The Knack performed at Cal Poly, and Yankovic managed to approach the band and Rupert Perry (then-vice president of Capitol Records) backstage. He informed them of who he was, and, according to Yankovic, [...] " [...] Doug Fieger [...] said 'Oh, [...] a really a great song!' and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Rupert Perry and said 'You guys oughta put this song out on Capitol Records' and Rupert said 'OK, let's do it!'" [...] Yankovic was paid $500 for the song's master, as well as the master for the soon-to-be b-side track [...] "School Cafeteria".

2500|$|With iron-like tenacity, {{he managed}} to gain his room, where {{he sat down and}} said: [...] "Now all organs are destroyed.

As he spoke, a great spasm of pain shook his body and blood gushed from an ear. Bennett thought: [...] "He has a {{cerebral}} haemorrhage. He will kill himself if he continues to force his body to move". But then he reflected: [...] "He has to do all this. If he allows his body to stop moving, he will die. He has power over his body".|$|E
2500|$|Finding these teachings to be {{insufficient}} to attain his goal, {{he turned to}} the practice of asceticism. This too fell short of attaining his goal, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the practice of dhyana, meditation, which he had already discovered in his youth. He famously sat in meditation under a Ficus religiosa tree now called the Bodhi Tree in the town of Bodh Gaya in the Gangetic plains region of South Asia. He gained insight into the workings of karma and his former lives, and attained enlightenment, certainty about the Middle Way (Skt. madhyamā-pratipad) as the right path of spiritual practice to end suffering (dukkha) from rebirths in Saṃsāra.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{hypotheses}} of {{extraterrestrial intelligence}} (ETI) and extradimensional intelligence (EDI), Hynek continued, [...] "There is sufficient evidence to defend both". As {{evidence for the}} ETI hypothesis, he mentioned the cases involving radar as good evidence of something solid, {{as well as the}} cases of physical evidence. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> defending the EDI hypothesis: in addition to the observations of materialization and dematerialization, he cited the [...] "poltergeist" [...] phenomenon experienced by some people after a close encounter; the photographs of UFOs, sometimes in only one frame, and not seen by witnesses; the changing of form in front of witnesses; the puzzling question of telepathic communication; that in close encounters of the third kind, the creatures seem to be at home in Earth's gravity and atmosphere; the sudden stillness {{in the presence of the}} craft; levitation of cars or people; and the development by some of psychic abilities after an encounter. [...] "Do we have two aspects of one phenomenon or two different sets of phenomena?" [...] Hynek asked.|$|E

Then Durdles bolts the something, as if desperately resigning himself to indigestion.|$|R
