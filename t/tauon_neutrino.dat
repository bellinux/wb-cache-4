5000|$|The tau {{neutrino}} or <b>tauon</b> <b>neutrino</b> is a subatomic elementary particle {{which has the}} symbol [...] and no net electric charge. Together with the tau, it forms the third generation of leptons, hence the name {{tau neutrino}}. Its existence was immediately implied after the tau particle was detected {{in a series of}} experiments between 1974 and 1977 by Martin Lewis Perl with his colleagues at the SLAC-LBL group. The discovery of the tau neutrino was announced in July 2000 by the DONUT collaboration (Direct Observation of the Nu Tau).|$|E

40|$|Since the 3 + 1 {{neutrino}} {{models with}} one light sterile neutrino {{turn out to}} be not very effective, at least two light sterile neutrinos may be needed to reconcile the solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments with the LSND result, {\it if} this is confirmed by the ongoing MiniBooNE experiment (and when the CPT invariance is assumed to hold for neutrino oscillations). We present an attractive 3 + 2 neutrino model, where two light sterile neutrinos mix maximally with each other, in analogy to the observed maximal mixing of muon and <b>tauon</b> active <b>neutrinos.</b> But, while the mixing of $\nu_e$ and $(\nu_\mu-\nu_\tau) /\sqrt 2 $ is observed as large (though not maximal), the mixing of $\nu_e$ with the corresponding combination of two light sterile neutrinos is expected to be only moderate because of the reported smallness of LSND oscillation amplitude. The presented model turns out, however, not to be {\it more} effective in explaining the hypothetic LSND result than the simplest 3 + 1 neutrino model. On the other hand, in the considered 3 + 2 model, the deviations from conventional oscillations of three active neutrinos appear to be {\it minimal} within a larger class of 3 + 2 models.

40|$|The {{search for}} UHE neutrinos {{is one of}} the most {{promising}} fields in astroparticle physics. The experimental techniques proposed to identify cosmic neutrino signatures are mainly three: the detection of Cherenkov blue light originated by charged leptons (electrons, positrons, muons and <b>tauons)</b> from <b>neutrino</b> interaction in water or ice; the detection of acoustic waves produced by neutrino energy deposition in water, ice or salt; the detection of radio pulses following neutrino interaction in ice or salt. Due to the expected neutrino fluxes (approximate to 10 (- 8) E(2) Gev/cm(2) s sr) and due to their extremely low interaction cross-section (approximate to 10 (- 32) cm(2) at 10 (20) eV). huge target volumes (approximate to km(3)) are required to detect them. Acoustic detection of neutrino is a very suitable technique since the sound attenuation length, at the frequency of interest, is of the order of km. Due to the small amplitude of the expected neutrino bipolar signal (approximate to 10 mPa), it is mandatory to develop an effective algorithm that increases the signal to noise ratio (SNR). In the present work a combination of matched filter, applied to each single hydrophone, and a beam-forming technique applied to a small array of hydrophones is proposed. The matched filter is a well-known technique of signal processing that maximizes the SNR in the presence of white noise. Beam forming is a signal-processing technique used in sensor arrays for directional analysis; the signals from different sensors are combined in such a way that pressure waves arriving from a specific direction are coherently summed. Preliminary results on simulated data will be shown. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

As this signal is not flavor specific, it is not immediately clear whether a convincing neutrino oscillation signal can be extracted from such experiments. To address this issue we examine the responses {{of a series of}} possible light and heavy mass targets, 9 Be, 23 Na, 35 Cl, and 208 Pb. We find that strategies for detecting oscillations which use only neutron count rates are problematic at best, even if cross sections are determined by ancillary experiments. Plausible uncertainties in supernova neutrino spectra tend to obscure rate enhancements due to oscillations. However, in the case of 208 Pb, a signal emerges that is largely flavor specific and extraordinarily sensitive to the nu_e temperature, the emission of two neutrons. This signal and its flavor specificity are associated with the strength and location of the first-forbidden responses for neutral and charge current reactions, aspects of the 208 Pb neutrino cross section that have not been discussed previously. Hadronic spin transfer experiments might be helpful in confirming some of the nuclear structure physics underlying our conclusions. Comment: 27 pages, RevTeX, 2 figure...|$|E
40|$|Neutrino physics {{has assumed}} greater {{importance}} in the active research since many years and is influencing many sciences like the particle physics, astrophysics, cosmology, nuclear physics and Geo- physics. In 1930, Wolfgang Pauli in his pioneering studies on neutrino proposed {{the necessity of a}} new particle to retain the law of conservation of energy and momentum during the β-decay process, which was conceived to be both chargeless and massless. Later, Fermi adopted the concept of new particle of Puali in developing a path-breaking β-decay theory and designated it as neutrino which means a tiny neutral one in Italian language. However, experimentally the neutrino was first discovered in 1959 by Clyde Cowan and Fred Reines from the nuclear reactor at the Savannah River in South Carolina which fetched them a Noble prize in 995. Interestingly, subsequent to the discovery of the neutrino in β-decay process two other types of neutrino were discovered associated with muon and tauon particles respectively. The muon type neutrino came into light in Pion decay process observed during collaborative studies by the national Laboratory and CERN led by Leon Lederman, Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger at Brookhaven. This discovery was applauded with a noble prize in 1988. The <b>tauon</b> type <b>neutrinos</b> existence was proven in July 2000 by the DONUT experiment launched to study the Direct Observations of the ντ in Fermilab. These three subatomic particles are divided into three generations that are analogous to the quark generations. The neutrinos are super abundantly available in nature unlike the other particles and possess fascinating properties like they are electrically neutral and colorless.

40|$|We study a {{model for}} the mass {{matrices}} of the leptons. We are able to relate the mass eigenvalues of the charged leptons and of the neutrinos to the mixing angles and can predict the masses of the neutrinos. We find a normal hierarchy- the masses are 0. 004 eV, 0. 01 eV and 0. 05 eV. The atmospheric mixing angle is given by the mass ratios of the charged leptons and the neutrinos. We find 38 degrees, consistent with the experiments. The mixing element, connecting the first neutrino with the electron, is found to be 0. 05. We observe three lepton-quark families in nature. The first family consists of the electron, its neutrino and the u- and d-quarks. The members of the second family are the muon, its neutrino and the c- and s-quarks. The third family consists of the <b>tauon,</b> its <b>neutrino</b> and the t- and b-quarks. It is unknown, whether there is a connection between the number of families and the number of colors in quantum chromodynamics. In the Standard Model 28 fundamental constants have to be introduced.
