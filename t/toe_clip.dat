40|$|<b>Toe</b> <b>clipping</b> {{is used as}} {{a method}} of {{identifying}} small rodents by using a predetermined numbering code 1 and may simultaneously be used as a method to obtain biopsy tissue for genotyping. <b>Toe</b> <b>clipping</b> should only be used in altricial pre-weaning rodents (e. g. mice and rats, NOT guinea pigs) after the toes are no longer webbed and before they reach eight days of age. Every reasonable effort should be made to minimize pain or distress, including limiting the number of digits clipped to one digit per rodent. If possible, it is preferable to remove toes from a hind paw rather than a forepaw. If the forepaw must be used, it is preferable to not cut the hallux (“dew claw ” or “little toe ” of the forepaw) as this may decrease the rodent’s grasping ability. To ensure pain and distress is minimized, sharp clippers or instruments should be used and personnel performing the procedure should be trained. Although the <b>toe</b> <b>clipping</b> method of animal identification has been considered to be a painful procedure, recently it was reported 2, 3 that <b>toe</b> <b>clipping</b> produces no more acute pain or distress than other commonly used rodent identification procedures when performed on mice from five to seven days of age. These studies also reported no long-term effects of this procedure in test batteries evaluating physical and behavioral development. It may be the preferred metho...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{total of}} 7, 428 turkey poults {{were used in}} two {{experiments}} designed to evaluate the interrelated effects of stocking density, lighting, <b>toe</b> <b>clipping,</b> and intermingling the sexes. Mor-tality was unaffected by stocking density. Although high stocking density {{had the effect of}} reduc-ing body weight and percent Grade A carcasses, monetary returns were highest per unit of floor area for birds grown under high stocking density conditions. There was no apparent monetary ad-vantage in extending the slaughter age from 98 to 119 days for males or by rearing the sexes sepa-rately to 14 weeks of age. Body weights of birds grown under low intensity, green light were heaviest but this was not reflected in higher monetary returns. There was no beneficial effect on the biological traits resulting from <b>toe</b> <b>clipping.</b> Body weight was adversely affected by <b>toe</b> <b>clipping</b> but this was not reflected in reduced monetary returns. In a windowless building, adequately venti-lated, with the capability of maintaining low internal temperatures (not exceeding 21 C), high stocking density and low light intensity may be useful in the conservation of both heat and light energy...|$|R

5000|$|To {{improve the}} {{performance}} of the quill pedal toe clips were added. The <b>toe</b> <b>clip</b> is a thin metal or plastic attachment to the front cage of the pedal. The <b>toe</b> <b>clip</b> is shaped like the toe of a shoe and its function is to prevent a cyclist's shoe from slipping off the pedal during the forward pedaling motion. A further enhancement of the quill pedal was modifying the <b>toe</b> <b>clip</b> to allow a strap and buckle to go around or through both the pedal and the <b>toe</b> <b>clip</b> to encircle the cyclist's foot {{on the top of the}} pedal. This strap is generally made of leather or nylon.To further improve the quill pedal's efficiency a [...] "cleat" [...] was developed. This cleat consists of a small metal or plastic attachment to the cyclist's shoe. The cleat is slotted and is adapted to engage a quill section of the bicycle pedal. The use of the slotted cleat enhances a cyclist's ability over that provided by toe clips and strap, enabling for greater pedaling efficiency. Although quill pedals can be used with smoothed-soled cycling shoes or ordinary shoes, they were designed to be used with cycling shoes which had a slotted shoeplate attached to its sole. The disadvantage with this system is that to remove the shoe from the pedal a rider had to reach down and loosen the strap by hand or leave the toe strap loose and thus give up some efficiency. This type of pedal and pedal setup was common for racing cyclists until the mid to late 1980s.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we have {{investigated}} the short- and long-term impact of <b>toe</b> <b>clipping,</b> a commonly used method for marking and simultaneously taking biopsies of pups, which is controversially discussed because of its potentially negative impact on animals. Furthermore, we have analysed animal welfare aspects such as health, behaviour, development, stress and detrimental effects in young animals and in adults after <b>toe</b> <b>clipping</b> at postnatal days 3 (P 3) and 7 (P 7). Our findings indicate that for both P 3 and P 7 pups amputations at the second phalange of one toe of each paw {{do not have any}} negative effects on growth and physical development and that the clipped pups do not suffer from rejection by their mother. Our data indicate that even though at both ages no abnormalities have been detected in histology, clipping at P 7 is the preferable age for an adequate marking mostly because of the small size of the toes at P 3. This was also confirmed by grip tests at the age of 12 weeks where P 3 animals had lower grip strength than control animals, whereas P 7 pups did not show any impairment. Hotplate tests indicated that <b>toe</b> <b>clipping</b> performed at P 3 and P 7 did not cause hyperalgesia at the amputation stump. Serum corticosterone analysis directly performed on P 7 pups after clipping indicated that major stress was provoked mainly through the handling and not because of the clipping itself. Taken together, these data lead to the conclusion that <b>toe</b> <b>clipping</b> is from a morphological, physiological and welfare point of view an acceptable method for marking and genotyping newborn mice...|$|R
40|$|<b>Toe</b> <b>clipping</b> {{is widely}} used to {{permanently}} mark many species of small vertebrates including marsupials, particularly didelphids and dasyurids. Small marsupials are marked as juveniles, by removing the tip of developing toe buds. It has recently been shown that survival and/or recapture probability decreases with increasing number of <b>toes</b> <b>clipped</b> in frogs. Because of this and other animal welfare concerns, <b>toe</b> <b>clipping</b> of adult vertebrates is increasingly being discouraged. The short- and long-term effects of toe-bud clipping have not been evaluated in marsupials. We used an experiment to test if marking more toes results in slower growth or higher mortality in the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii, Dasyuridae) in the short or long term. We found no harmful effects of toe-bud clipping. There were no infections associated with <b>clipping,</b> marking more <b>toes</b> did not reduce growth in young or adults, and did not affect survival of young in captivity, survival of independent animals in the wild, or recapture probability. Toe-bud clipping is done at an extremely immature stage, when the area cut is tiny and perception and memory of pain {{is unlikely to be}} a problem. We suggest that toe-bud clipping is a humane and benign method of permanently marking antechinuses, and probably also the young of other morphologically similar small marsupials...|$|R
40|$|Effective marking {{techniques}} {{are required for}} both laboratory and field studies of adult amphibians, especially when individuals cannot be identified based on color or pattern. We compared the efficacy of four marking techniques: <b>toe</b> <b>clipping,</b> visual implant elastomer (VIE) tags, and passive integrative transponder (PIT) tags injected into two locations (the body cavity and subcutaneously) in the endangered Alpine Tree Frog, Litoria verreauxii alpina. The most effective marking method was <b>toe</b> <b>clipping,</b> with 96. 1 % correct identifications. The second best marking method was PIT tags injected subcutaneously, where tags were retained in 73. 3 % of animals after six weeks, but tag retention might decrease over time due to tag expulsion. PIT tags injected into the body cavity were poorly retained (33. 3 %). The least successful marking method was VIE tags, as individuals were correctly identified only 18. 4 % of the time. We conclude that <b>toe</b> <b>clipping</b> may remain the most effective marking method for some amphibian species, where modern tagging {{techniques are}} unreliable due to low tag retention and high tag movement. Researchers should conduct marking trials before implementing large scale marking schemes in unstudied species, and they should publish negative results as well as desired outcomes...|$|R
5000|$|Quill pedals are {{sometimes}} {{said to be}} named for the quill or [...] "pick up tab" [...] on {{the rear of the}} pedal. The weight of the <b>toe</b> <b>clip</b> and strap would make the pedal hang upside down, and the rider would tap the quill with their shoe to flip the pedal over so the shoe could be inserted into the pedal.|$|E
50|$|Studying the problem, Spademan {{found three}} problems; {{bindings}} didn't release in the directions that caused problems, they didn't release under straight-line deceleration, and the adjustments were too complex. In particular, {{he noted that}} any forward fall, even to the sides, would jam the boot into the toe clips. This meant that a forward twisting fall would work against the fundamental action of the binding. Spademan desired a binding that had no toe piece, allowing the boot to slide forward unimpeded. His first attempt to solve these problems clipped {{to the sides of}} a plate at the heel, with no <b>toe</b> <b>clip</b> at all. However, this allowed the toe to move about too much, so a new <b>toe</b> <b>clip</b> was added to address this. He then noticed that the key to reducing injury would be to mount the ski over the tribal axis of the leg, below the calf. This would reduce torque on the knee and ankle when the ski rotated under the boot. This led to a new design with the binding mounted under the boot, and from there to the final Spademan design.|$|E
50|$|The cable binding {{attaches}} firmly at the toe only, {{normally in}} a trapezoidal metal cup {{roughly the same}} as the toe of a boot. A strap is fastened over the toe to stop it from rising out of the cup vertically. Another cable holds the boot forward into the cup, and under the tow strap. If the heel is lifted, causing the boot to rotate in the <b>toe</b> <b>clip,</b> a spring keeps tension on the cable to keep the boot pressed forward.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} cycling tourist usually used <b>toe</b> <b>clips</b> and straps, but touring shoes {{designed for}} use with clipless pedals are now also common, usually with a recessed cleat so that the rider can both walk and cycle effectively.

50|$|Attaching {{the shoes}} to the pedals gives the user {{more control over}} the pedal movements. There are two methods for {{attaching}} a cyclist's shoes to their pedals: <b>toe</b> <b>clips,</b> a basket-and-strap device which hold the foot in place; and so-called clipless pedals, where specialized shoes with built-in bindings attach to compatible pedals.|$|R
50|$|His {{first year}} at Team CSC wasn't entirely successful, as a crash into a car just before the Milan-San Remo ruined {{the first four months}} of his season, though he still managed a few minor results. 2001 was a better season for Piil, as he won the Peace Race and, perhaps most {{importantly}} for his later career, finished a merriting 2nd at stage 17 in the 2001 Tour de France. After a 16-man break-away was established after only five kilometres, Piil was one of three riders in the 16-man group who were able to keep the peloton behind them, but Piil found himself beaten by Serge Baguet at the finish line. In 2002 Piil won Paris-Tours and Danmark Rundt, and once again tried his luck at winning a stage in the 2002 Tour de France. At the 18th stage, Piil was lined up in a favourable position to sprint for the stage win, when his foot jumped out of the <b>toe</b> <b>clip</b> with 250 meters to go, and Piil came in third.|$|E
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of dedicated ski lifts in 1908 {{led to an}} evolution of skiing as a sport. In the past, skiers would have to ski or walk up the hills they intended to ski down. With the lift, the skiers could leave their skis on, and would be skiing downhill all the time. The need to unclip the heel for cross-country use was eliminated, at least at resorts with lifts. The cable binding became a must-have. Cable bindings were almost universal by the late-1930s, and used famously by the US 10th Mountain Division during World War II. For pure downhill skiing, the Kandahar was a problem. In particular, the metal <b>toe</b> <b>clip</b> so tightly clamped {{the front of the}} boot that even small sideways motions of the tip of the ski could twist the lower leg, and spiral fractures of the calf were common. The death grip led to the nickname [...] "bear trap bindings", and it was estimated that 1% of skiers suffered an injury on any given day.|$|E
50|$|An older {{system is}} the {{toe-clip}} and toestrap. A toeclip is a metal cage attached {{to the front of}} the pedal into which the rider inserts the shoe. There are two methods for using pedals with toeclips. The first is a cycling shoe with a slotted shoeplate. Before the introduction of the clipless pedal, most racing shoes had a hard leather or plastic sole to which a metal or plastic shoe plate or cleat was attached. The shoeplate had a slot that fitted into the pedal. The shoeplate along with <b>toe</b> <b>clip</b> and strap keep the rider's feet firmly attached to the pedals. The drawback is that a rider had to reach down and loosen the toestrap by hand to take his foot out of the pedal and for this reason toeclips have been made largely obsolete by clipless pedals. The second is to use a cycling shoe with a smooth sole or a non-cycling shoe. This had the disadvantage of the rider's feet not being firmly attached to the pedals but had the advantage of being able to release from the pedals without having to loosen the strap by hand, and also any shoe can be used.|$|E

5000|$|Clipless pedals (also clip-in or step-in) {{require a}} special cycling shoe with a cleat fitted to the sole, which locks into a {{mechanism}} in the pedal and thus holds the shoe firmly to the pedal. Most clipless pedals lock onto the cleat when stepped on firmly and unlock when the heel is twisted outward, although {{in some cases}} the locking mechanism is built into the cleat instead of the pedal. Clipless refers to the <b>toe</b> <b>clip</b> (cage) having been replaced by a locking mechanism and not to platform pedals which would normally not have toe clips.The clipless pedal was invented by Charles Hanson in 1895. It allowed the rider to twist the shoe to lock and unlock and had rotational float (the freedom to rotate the shoe slightly to prevent joint strain).The M71 was a clipless pedal designed by Cino Cinelli and produced by his company in 1971. It used a plastic shoe cleat which slid into grooves in the pedal and locked in place with a small lever located on {{the back side of the}} pedal body. To release the shoe a rider had to reach down and operate the lever, similar to the way a racing cyclist had to reach down and loosen the toestrap. The lever was placed on the outside edge of the pedal so that in the event of a fall the lever hitting the ground would release the foot. The pedal was designed for racing, in particular track racing, and because of the need to reach them to unclip they have been referred to as [...] "death cleats".In 1984, the French company Look applied downhill snow skiing binding or cleat technology to pedals producing the first widely used clipless pedals. Initially used by triathletes in order to facilitate faster [...] "transitions", Bernard Hinault's victory in Tour de France in 1985 then helped secure the acceptance of quick-release clipless pedal systems by cyclists. Those pedals, and compatible models by other manufacturers, remain in widespread use today. The cleat is engaged by simply pushing down and forward on the pedal, or, with some designs, by twisting the cleat in sideways. Then, instead of loosening a toestrap or pulling a lever, the cyclist releases a foot from the pedal by twisting the heel outward.The next major development in clipless pedals was Shimano's SPD (Shimano Pedaling Dynamics) pedal system. Whereas Look cleats are large and protrude from the sole of the shoe, SPD cleats are small and could be fitted in a recess in the sole, making it possible to walk (although comfort will vary, as the soles of different cycling shoes vary in their rigidity depending on design). Cycling shoes have rigid soles to maximize power transfer and efficiency. They may be specific to road or mountain biking, or usable for both. Shoes designed for mountain biking typically have recessed cleats that do not protrude beyond the sole of the shoe, and have treads for walking on trails, as walking or carrying the bike is often required. Road cycling shoes are typically lighter than their mountain bike counterparts, and feature a protruding cleat and less weather proofing. The protruding cleat makes these shoes impractical for walking, as doing so can damage the cleat. Mountain bike cleats can generally be mounted without difficulty to road shoes although sometimes an adapter is required. Such attachment is not usually possible for road pedals, as the cleats are normally too large to be mounted on mountain shoes. The smaller mountain bike cleats are attached to the sole of the shoe by two bolts; larger road-specific cleats are attached by three. Various manufacturers have produced their own designs of clipless pedal systems over the years.Platform adapters are designed to temporarily convert clipless pedals into more traditional platform pedals which have a larger and flatter area for the foot to rest on. Clipless pedals can have advantages over flat ones, especially in mountain biking and racing. They keep the foot from slipping in wet and muddy conditions and provide better transfer of power. Since the pedal platform adapters temporarily converts these into platform pedals, this allows riders to wear normal shoes without switching to another bike with a different pedal setup. They can be fastened by using bolts but as they are normally in temporary use, it is also common for them to be mounted using different snap-on techniques. Although it's possible to use clipless pedals with regular footwear, they will be much less comfortable than platform pedals, as the shoe sole is more likely to bend or slip.|$|E
40|$|Ranavirus (Iridoviridae) {{infection}} {{is a significant}} cause of mortality in amphibians. Detection of infected individuals, particularly carriers, is necessary to prevent and control outbreaks. Recently, the use of toe clips to detect ranavirus infection through PCR was proposed {{as an alternative to}} the more frequently used lethal liver sampling in green frogs (Rana Lithobates] clamitans). We attempted reevaluate the use of toe clips, evaluate the potential use of blood onto filter paper and hepatic fine needle aspirates (FNAs) as further alternatives, and explore the adequacy of using green frogs as a target-sampling species when searching for ranavirus infection in the wild. Samples were obtained from 190 postmetamorphic (= 1 -yr-old) green frogs from five ponds on Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada. Three of the ponds had contemporary or recent tadpole mortalities due to Frog Virus 3 (FV 3) ranavirus. PCR testing for ranavirus DNA was performed on 190 toe clips, 188 blood samples, 72 hepatic FNAs, and 72 liver tissue samples. Only two frogs were ranavirus-positive: liver and <b>toe</b> <b>clip</b> were positive in one, liver only was positive in the other; all blood and FNAs, including those from the two positive frogs, were negative. Results did not yield a definitive answer on the efficacy of testing each type of sample, but resemble what is found in salamanders infected with Ambystoma tigrinum (rana) virus. Findings indicate a low prevalence of FV 3 in postmetamorphic green frogs on PEI (= 2. 78 %) and suggest that green frogs are poor reservoirs (carriers) for the virus...|$|E
40|$|Amphibians are {{the most}} {{endangered}} groups of vertebrates, and there is currently an urgent need to implement efficient monitoring schemes based on insights from DNA. However, largely due to their unprotected skin which lacks dead keratinised tissue, current standard techniques for DNA sampling of endangered amphibians are either destructive (sacrifice of entire animals) or can involve distinctly invasive techniques such as tissue sampling based on toe or tail tip clips. The present MSc by Research {{for the first time}} quantitatively investigates whether skin swabs with commercially available Whatman FTA cards, a relatively uninvasive technique, can yield DNA samples of sufficient quality and quantity for PCR amplification. In total, swabs from 22 individual great crested newts (Triturus cristatus, the most endangered newt in the UK and an important flagship species for conservation) were analysed, and partly directly compared with <b>toe</b> <b>clip</b> samples. For amplification tests, 7 nuclear microsatellite loci and one mitochondrial locus (ND 4) were used; the success rates of PCRs were quantified by replicate PCRs based on DNA extractions using different protocols. While PCR success rates differed across genetic markers, the study showed that, with sufficient replicates, it is possible to efficiently retrieve amplifiable amphibian DNA based on FTA-card skin swabs. The most successful protocol was based on the merging of eight punches from different areas of the FTA card for DNA extraction using the commercially available Qiagen kit, leading to PCR amplification rates which were largely indiscernible from PCRs based on tissue samples. The established new protocol for DNA collection should aid in reducing the invasiveness of DNA collection in future amphibian studies...|$|E
