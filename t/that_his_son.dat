5|$|Art Houtteman {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan, on August 7, 1927. He was a second-generation American citizen; his {{grandfather}} Joseph had emigrated from Belgium. The only son born to the Houtteman family, Art's father, also named Arthur, vowed <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> would become a major league player {{by the time he}} turned 17.|$|E
5|$|Blythe also {{alleged that}} after {{learning}} about Nosek's death, {{he had written}} {{a letter to the}} Nosek family, in which he offered help and a meeting in-person. Daniel Nosek's father, however, testified that the family has not been contacted by anyone from the band nor by the defense team. Nosek's father confirmed <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> had been healthy up until the day of the incident. The Nosek family's representative brought a claim for damages in the amount of CZK 10,000,000 (approx. US$530,000).|$|E
5|$|During his labors {{to sustain}} the {{provisional}} government, Johnson's lack of hearing from his family weighed heavily upon him. The only family member {{with whom he had}} contact was his son Madison ("Matty"), who had joined John Hunt Morgan's cavalry. Johnson admired and respected Morgan, and was pleased <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> had chosen to serve under him. In 1862, he requested by letter that his wife send their fifteen-year-old son Junius to serve in the Confederate Army. Despite Johnson's protestations that he would ensure his son's safety, his wife refused this request.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of the {{execution}} of a commission for the Hospital de Tavera, El Greco fell seriously ill, and a month later, on 7 April 1614, he died. A few days earlier, on 31 March, he had directed <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> should have the power to make his will. Two Greeks, friends of the painter, witnessed this last will and testament (El Greco never lost touch with his Greek origins). He was buried in the Church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, aged 73.|$|E
5|$|He was {{succeeded by}} his brother, Ceolwulf; a post-Conquest legend claims <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> Cynehelm was murdered {{to gain the}} succession. Within two years Ceolwulf had been deposed, and the kingship passed {{permanently}} out of Coenwulf's family. Coenwulf was the last king of Mercia to exercise substantial dominance over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Within a decade of his death, the rise of Wessex had begun under King Egbert, and Mercia never recovered its former position of power.|$|E
5|$|In 1810, Hogg {{went up to}} University College, Oxford, his father's alma mater. There he met {{and became}} friends with Percy Bysshe Shelley in October 1810. Hogg and Shelley often {{discussed}} literature and metaphysics, had a shared disdain for religion and Oxford society, and were united in their belief in free love and free thinking. Although Shelley's father initially feared <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> was being corrupted by Hogg's ideas, he was reassured {{when he learned that}} Hogg was from a respectable family.|$|E

50|$|John II died in 1424 and {{was buried}} in the church of the Dominicans in Ratibor. It was not until 1427 <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons</b> agreed to divide <b>his</b> possessions: <b>his</b> <b>son</b> Wenceslaus {{received}} the City and Duchy of Racibórz, Nicholas received Krnov, Bruntál, Pszczyna, Rybnik and Baborów.|$|R
50|$|The kingdom {{started after}} king Jayayakshya Malla divided <b>his</b> kingdom so <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons</b> {{could be the}} rulers of their own kingdom. After its formation, the kingdom {{replaced}} Bhaktapur as the main trading center.|$|R
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, Chris alerts his parents of a failing grade he {{received}} at school on a science test, causing his mother to suggest he receive help on his homework. Chris then asks his father, Peter, for help who ends up rejecting him, leading Chris to blame his bad grades on the Evil Monkey, and announces that he will prove the monkey is real. Peter then suggests <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> {{would have to do}} a better job than God when he created actresses Ellen Barkin and Kelly McGillis.|$|E
5|$|John Jervis {{was born}} in Meaford, Staffordshire, on 9 January 1735, the second son of Swynfen and Elizabeth Jervis. His father was a barrister, {{counsellor}} to the Admiralty Board and auditor of Greenwich Hospital. Swynfen Jervis intended <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> should follow him to the bar. The young Jervis was educated at Burton-upon-Trent Grammar School and subsequently at Reverend Swinden's Academy in Greenwich, London.|$|E
5|$|Julius Delius assumed <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> {{would play}} a part in the family wool business, and {{for the next three years}} he tried hard to persuade him to do so. Delius's first job was as the firm's {{representative}} in Stroud in Gloucestershire, where he did moderately well. After being sent in a similar capacity to Chemnitz, he neglected his duties in favour of trips to the major musical centres of Germany, and musical studies with Hans Sitt. His father sent him to Sweden, where he again put his artistic interests ahead of commerce, coming under the influence of the Norwegian dramatists Henrik Ibsen and Gunnar Heiberg. Ibsen's denunciations of social conventions further alienated Delius from his commercial background. Delius was then sent to represent the firm in France, but he frequently absented himself from business for excursions to the French Riviera. After this, Julius Delius recognised that there was no prospect <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> would succeed in the family business, but he remained opposed to music as a profession, and instead sent him to America to manage an orange plantation.|$|E
50|$|Ragnar was {{not happy}} <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons</b> had taken revenge without his help, and decided to conquer England with only two knarrs. King Ælla of Northumbria {{defeated}} Ragnar and threw him into a snake pit where he died.|$|R

2500|$|About this time, Walker {{retired from}} RRLC which <b>his</b> <b>sons</b> Gilbert, Fletcher, Willis, and Archie then ran. Walker grew [...] "increasingly frustrated" [...] that he couldn't control the {{business}} by himself. The Minnesota Historical Society notes <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons</b> didn't always see [...] "eye to eye" [...] {{with each other}} or with Walker.|$|R
5|$|Offa's {{diplomatic}} relations with Europe are well documented, but appear to belong only to the last dozen years of his reign. In letters dating from the late 780s or early 790s, Alcuin congratulates Offa for encouraging education and greets Offa's wife and son, Cynethryth and Ecgfrith. In about 789, or shortly before, Charlemagne proposed <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> Charles marry one of Offa's daughters, most likely Ælfflæd. Offa countered with a request <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> Ecgfrith should also marry Charlemagne's daughter Bertha: Charlemagne was outraged by the request, and broke off contact with Britain, forbidding English ships from landing in his ports. Alcuin's letters {{make it clear that}} by the end of 790 the dispute was still not resolved, and that Alcuin was hoping to be sent to help make peace. In the end {{diplomatic relations}} were restored, at least partly by the agency of Gervold, the abbot of St Wandrille.|$|E
5|$|Ross Goodall {{subsequently}} {{communicated with}} Capaldi through the actor's agent, to inform him that Thomas's grandmother had died. (Helen, aged 72, died in early October 2014.) He told Capaldi <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> was not dealing {{well with the}} grief from his grandmother's death. The family received the subsequent video message to Thomas from Capaldi {{three weeks after the}} death of the child's grandmother.|$|E
5|$|Six of {{the dead}} were not wearing seat belts, while a seventh was not {{properly}} restrained. Greg Sypher, a collision analyst and principal Transport Canada investigator, later suggested that seat belts most likely would not have saved all the victims' lives. Randy Arseneau credits the fact <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>son,</b> Bradd Arseneau, was not wearing his seatbelt for Bradd's survival, saying that if Bradd had not been thrown to the floor just before the collision he may also have died.|$|E
50|$|He {{was also}} an early member of the Royal Aero Club of the United Kingdom, serving on its {{committees}} as early as 1909. It may be from here <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons</b> got their impetus to join the Royal Flying Corps.|$|R
5000|$|However he {{was accused}} by NKGB (the name of the Soviet secter police at the time) <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons</b> were with the [...] "Forest Brothers". He could not stand interrogations, and on November 10, 1944, he {{committed}} suicide at Kaunas.|$|R
60|$|Dr. May {{took the}} {{management}} of himself into his own hands, and paid so little attention to Mr. Ward's recommendations <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons</b> and daughters were in continual dread of his choosing {{to do something that}} might cause injurious agitation.|$|R
5|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that Labyrinth had {{a budget of}} $25 million. The film was a box office disappointment, grossing $12.9 million during its U.S. theatrical run. The commercial failure demoralized Henson to the extent <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> Brian remembered {{the time of the}} film's release {{as one of the most}} difficult periods of his father's career. It would be the last feature film directed by Henson before his death in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} preceded by 27 panels showing various preparations, {{in the heavens}} and on the earth, to welcome the final {{incarnation}} of the Bodhisattva. Before descending from Tushita heaven, the Bodhisattva entrusted his crown to his successor, the future Buddha Maitreya. He descended on earth {{in the shape of}} white elephants with six tusks, penetrated to Queen Maya's right womb. Queen Maya had a dream of this event, which was interpreted <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> would become either a sovereign or a Buddha.|$|E
5|$|This Lime-Tree Bower and Frost at Midnight also {{deal with}} a similar {{understanding}} of nature, and the ideas within This Lime-Tree Bower {{form the basis for}} a natural education. Coleridge hoped <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> Hartley would be able to learn through nature in an innocent way. Unlike Wordsworth's nature, Coleridge's has a strong Christian presence and nature is a physical presence of God's word. There is also a connection between Dejection and Frost at Midnight with its emphasis on Coleridge's private life.|$|E
50|$|The Guru {{emphasised}} how he {{was proud}} <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons</b> had died fighting in battle, {{and that he had}} 'thousands of sons - the Singhs'. He also said that he would never trust Aurengzeb again due to his broken promises and lies.|$|R
50|$|In 1815, {{the year}} after his marriage, Chambers left London for Worcester, where he {{remained}} for nearly eight years. He moved to his wife's home at Wymondham, and after about two years, settled at Norwich, so <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons</b> could attend the grammar school there.|$|R
50|$|Ma Yin died in 930. He left {{instructions}} <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons</b> were to {{pass the}} throne to their younger brothers, and further ordered that anyone who spoke against this succession principle be put to death. Ma Xisheng thereafter took {{over control of the}} state.|$|R
5|$|Although the Charter of 1215 was {{a failure}} as a peace treaty, it was resurrected under the new {{government}} of the young Henry III {{as a way of}} drawing support away from the rebel faction. On his deathbed, King John appointed a council of thirteen executors to help Henry reclaim the kingdom, and requested <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> be placed into the guardianship of William Marshal, {{one of the most famous}} knights in England. William knighted the boy, and Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, the papal legate to England, then oversaw his coronation at Gloucester Cathedral on 28 October.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Smetana {{completed}} his schooling, his father's fortunes had declined. Although František now agreed <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> should follow a musical career, {{he could not}} provide financial support. In August 1843 Smetana departed for Prague with twenty gulden, and no immediate prospects. Lacking any formal musical training, he needed a teacher, and was introduced by Kateřina Kolářová's mother to Josef Proksch, head of the Prague Music Institute—where Kateřina was now studying. Proksch used the most modern teaching methods, drawing on Beethoven, Chopin, Berlioz and the Leipzig circle of Liszt. In January 1844 Proksch agreed to take Smetana as a pupil, {{and at the same}} time the young musician's financial difficulties were eased when he secured an appointment as music teacher to the family of a nobleman, Count Thun.|$|E

In an angry panic, he kills both Gino and Johnnie, and Gino's bodyguard Roy. He tells Violet {{that they have to}} find the money, dispose of the bodies, and pretend Gino and Johnnie never arrived, lest their Mafia pals find the money or men missing. Unable to find the money at Johnnie's apartment, Caesar telephones Mickey (John P. Ryan), a Mafia friend, telling him that Gino has yet to arrive.|$|E
