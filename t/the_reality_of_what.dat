5|$|After {{seeing how}} well the first film was made, {{the cast and crew}} signed for two sequels to be shot back-to-back, a {{practical}} decision on Disney's part to allow more time with the same cast and crew. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio knew that with an ensemble cast, they weren't free to invent totally different situations and characters, as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, and so had to retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the first of a trilogy. They wanted to explore <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace {{at the end of the}} first film, and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device. They settled on introducing Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken, a mythology mentioned twice in the first film. They introduced the historical East India Trading Company (also mentioned in the first film), which for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates.|$|E

25|$|The {{calculation}} of $24 also fails {{to recognize that}} the concepts of property trading and ownership held by the 17th-century Dutch and East Coast natives were both different from modern conceptions. Comparisons to modern land dealing distort <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Minuit was trying to do. Both the Dutch and the Indians undoubtedly included intangibles along with any hard goods in their concept of the total transactional value. For Indians and Minuit alike, both sides felt they were getting far more than a mere 60 guilders. For instance, the natives most certainly would have thought the trade included the value of the Dutch as potential military allies against rival Indian nations—a 'good' that could not be valued in currency alone. In addition, the value of the sale to Dutch and Indians alike would have included the prospect of future trade.|$|E

500|$|Percy {{took the}} land route across Boston Neck {{and over the}} Great Bridge, which some quick-thinking colonists had {{stripped}} of its planking to delay the British. [...] His men then came upon an absent-minded tutor at Harvard College and asked him which road would take them to Lexington. [...] The Harvard man, apparently oblivious to <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was happening around him, showed him the proper road without thinking. [...] (He was later compelled {{to leave the country}} for inadvertently supporting the enemy.) [...] Percy's troops arrived in Lexington at about 2:00 p.m. [...] They could hear gunfire in the distance as they set up their cannon and deployed lines of regulars on high ground with commanding views of the town. [...] Colonel Smith's men approached like a fleeing mob with the full complement of colonial militia in close formation pursuing them. [...] Percy ordered his artillery to open fire at extreme range, dispersing the colonial militiamen. [...] Smith's men collapsed with exhaustion once they reached the safety of Percy's lines.|$|E

The {{black-and-white}} video opens with a warning message: [...] "The following contains graphic content that may be emotionally unsettling but reflects <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is happening daily on college campuses." [...] It then shows a girl walking through an empty corridor, followed by young people in various activities in a college campus: reading (portrayed by actress Nikki Reed), a trans man adjusting his chest binder in the bathroom, attending a party (one of the partygoers being portrayed by actress Kiersey Clemons). However they are all sexually assaulted, {{with one of the}} scenes showing a couple of young girls being drugged and raped at the party. The heartbroken girls and the trans man cry, while alternate images show them expressing their emotions by inscribing words on themselves. Ultimately they find solace and hope in friendship, and leave the college with their friends, as the words inscribed on their bodies change to positive messages. Near its ending, the music video displays the message: [...] "One in five college women will be sexually assaulted this year unless something changes", following which the message points the audience to the Facebook page for The Hunting Ground and Itsonus.org, the White House support website for people who have endured a sexual crime. A portion of the earnings from the song's digital sales will be donated to organizations supporting victims of sexual assault.|$|E

[...] Choudary wrote that the proposed march was to [...] "engage the British public's minds on the real reasons why their soldiers are returning home in body bags and the real cost of the war." [...] In an interview with Sky News, he stated that the location was chosen to effect a level of media attention which [...] "it would not have gained anywhere else". [...] The proposal was condemned by the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, who said that to offend the families of dead or wounded troops would be [...] "completely inappropriate". [...] The Minhaj-ul-Quran International UK centre in Forest Gate also condemned the proposal, as did the Muslim Council of Britain, which stated that it [...] "condemns the call by the fringe extremist group Islam4UK for their proposed march in Wootton Bassett." [...] The planned march was cancelled by the group, on 10 January 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{films have}} magical realist {{narrative}} {{and events that}} contrast between real and magical elements, or different modes of production. This device explores <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> exists. Fredrick Jameson, in [...] "On Magic Realism in Film", advances a hypothesis that magical realism in film is a formal mode that is constitutionally dependent on a type of historical raw material in which disjunction is structurally present. Like Water for Chocolate (1992) begins and ends with the first person narrative to establishing the magical realism storytelling frame. Telling a story from a child's point of view, the historical gaps and holes perspective, and with cinematic color heightening the presence, are magical realist tools in films. Some other films that convey elements of magic realism are The Green Mile (1999), Amélie (2001), The Mistress of Spices (2005), Undertow (2009), Biutiful (2010), Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012), Birdman (2014), a number of films by Woody Allen (including The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985), Alice (1990), Midnight in Paris (2011), and To Rome With Love (2012)). Additionally, most of the films directed by Terry Gilliam are strongly influenced by magic realism, the animated films of Hayao Miyazaki often utilize magic realism, {{and some of the}} films of Emir Kusturica contain elements of magical realism, the most famous of which is Time of the Gypsies (1988).|$|E

In October 2014, the ANU Council announced that it would divest from seven companies, two of which, Santos and Oil Search, performed poorly in an independent review undertaken by the Centre for Australian Ethical Research. This decision provoked a month-long controversy with the Australian Financial Review publishing over 53 stories criticising the decision including 12 front pages attacking the ANU, with its editor-in-chief, Michael Stutchbury, prouncing the decision to be as [...] "disingenuous" [...] as banning the burqa. These attacks, which The Canberra Times editorial described as [...] "verging on hysterical" [...] was joined by members of the cabinet of the Abbott Government, with the Treasurer Joe Hockey stating that the ANU Council is [...] "removed from <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is helping to drive the Australian economy and create more employment," [...] Education Minister Christopher Pyne calling it [...] "bizarre" [...] and Prime Minister Tony Abbott calling it [...] "stupid."
