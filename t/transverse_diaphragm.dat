The article also reviews and analyzes previously performed works and methods for accounting for deviations {{in the design of}} metal structures. Research objectives: analysis of deviation values and mounting stress-strain state (MSSS) of the <b>transverse</b> <b>diaphragm</b> of a single-chord hinge-rod metal shell. A comparative calculation of deviations and calculation results analysis was made on the example of a <b>transverse</b> <b>diaphragm</b> of a single-chord hinge-rod metal shell of the roof structure for different technological assembly-mounting schemes: from the supports to the arch center, and vice versa, from the arch center to its supports. Materials and methods: geometrical method for determining deviations is implemented in the the author’s computer program - computing complex of dimensional analysis (CP CCDA); method of finite elements (FEM) is used for determining mounting stress-strain state and is implemented in SCAD 11. 5. Results: The calculation and analysis of the mounting stress-strain state (MSSS) of the diaphragm was performed. Out of two assembly schemes considered in the paper we recommend the second technological scheme of assembly-mounting and also possible ways of compensation for the assembly deviations in the end diaphragm of the cylindrical roof structure of the hangar. We suggest possible options for modeling deviations of individual members of rod systems for several types of profiles and we propose possible cross sections of diaphragms of arched roof structures. Conclusions: the methodology for determining the installation deviations and the method for determining the MSSS, proposed in this article, can be used to determine deviations in a variety of large-span hinge-rod metal structures...|$|E
40|$|The Utah Transportation Center, in {{conjunction}} with the Mountain Plains Consortium, sponsored a study that investigated the distribution factors and load ratings of a continuous, steel I-girder bridge. The SH- 52 Bridge over the Snake River is located on the Idaho-Oregon border near Payette, Idaho. The bridge was built in the 1950 ’s and presently supports two lanes of traffic. A finite-element model of the bridge was calibrated with the results from a liveload test. For the live-load test, the bridge was instrumented at nine longitudinal cross section locations with 62 strain gauges attached on the girders, stringers, and intermediate diaphragms. The live-load was applied with two heavy trucks that were driven along three predetermined load paths. The calibrated finite-element model was used to quantify moment distribution factors and load ratings for the bridge. The finite-element distribution factors were compared to those calculated according to the AASHTO Standard and AASHTO LRFD Specifications. The distribution factors from both AASHTO codes were found to be unconservative for the girders and overly conservative for the stringers. The model was also used to quantify the effect of the <b>transverse</b> <b>diaphragm</b> members on the live-load distribution. Distribution factors were calculated with and without the diaphragm members. The diaphragms were found to increase the distribution of moments by over 20 % for both positive and negative moments...|$|E
40|$|Infra-red {{thermography}} {{systems that}} have been developed {{over the last few years}} offer great potential to locate and discover flaws in steel highway bridge structures at a relatively early stage in their development. Under ideal conditions, the use of infra-red instrumentation should allow bridge inspection personnel to rapidly scan the structure and determine if a potential structural problem has developed. If a problem spot is located by the infra-red camera, then the trouble spot can be examined carefully to determine the need for corrective maintenance. The primary purpose of this research study is to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of sensitive infra-red equipment for detecting fatigue cracks in steel highway bridge structures and components. The performance and sensitivity of one particular infra-red system was explored by conducting tests on two different specimen types in the laboratory, followed by a check of the equipment under field conditions. Crack detection sensitivity in the laboratory was evaluated using a center-hole test coupon geometry as well as a welded attachment plate detail. The test samples were subjected to cyclic loading to initiate and propagate a fatigue crack. Control variables for the infra-red system were then varied to evaluate the optimal conditions. The field tests were conducted to assess the equipment limitations and performance under field conditions. The detail inspected involved a vertical plate that was welded to the web of a beam member and used to attach <b>transverse</b> <b>diaphragm</b> cross-frame members; the diaphragm connection plate was selected for inspection because it was known that fatigue cracks had developed at the end of a number of the vertical plates. It was found that infra-red inspection could be used successfully to detect fatigue cracks in steel bridge members and components if the crack had propagated through the thickness. Consequently, the crack size that could be reliably and consistently detected was not significantly different from that which could be detected from a careful visual inspection. Moreover, a number of difficulties were encountered when using infra-red inspection in the field. Limitations were encountered in the field related to mobility of the equipment, calibration requirements, operator skill level required, and the variable effects of environmental factors that influence the detection capabilities...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the dynamic behavior of twin-box girder bridges under high-speed railway traffic. On {{the basis of}} several representative examples derived from recently built high-speed bridges, this contribution examines the effects of transverse bending in the upper slab of these structures and evaluates the bending moments in resonance conditions. The analysis was carried out {{according to one of}} the reference norms for the assessment of dynamic effects in high-speed bridges (Eurocode). The results demonstrate that the predicted dynamic response for shorter-span bridges can be unexpectedly higher than the static effects caused by the design loads as a result of transverse resonances induced by the absence of <b>transverse</b> <b>diaphragms</b> between the box girders and the movement of the sliding supports. Moreover, these strong impact coefficients may occur even when the maximum level of vertical vibrations in the deck is not severe.

40|$|In {{the design}} of {{composite}} bridges, the North American practice either ignores or minimizes the contribution of <b>transverse</b> <b>diaphragms</b> to the <b>transverse</b> load distribution; this results, among other disadvantages, in heavier longitudinal steel girders than necessary {{as well as in}} the loss of headroom. In this thesis, parametric and experimental studies were carried out to investigate the influence of simply and rigidly connected diaphragms on the structural response of composite bridges. In the analyses, both the yield line theory and the finite element method were used. Formulae based on yield line theory are developed to predict the ultimate load capacity of composite bridges. These formulae were based on both the parametric study as well as on laboratory test results on composite bridges. The developed formulae can be used to predict the ultimate load capacity or the required ultimate moment of resistance for {{the design of}} simple span and continuous span composite bridges. On the other hand, the finite element method is used to conduct a parametric study of the response of composite bridges under elastic and post-elastic loading ranges. The experimental study was conducted on four composite bridge models in two groups. Group A consists of two simply-supported single span bridge models and Group B consists of two continuous two-span bridge models. The test results were used to verify the assumption made in the theoretical analyses and to substantiate the results from such analyses. Good correspondence between the theoretical and experimental results is found. Both the analytical and experimental results demonstrated that the response of rigidly connected diaphragm composite bridges is superior to that of the simply connected diaphragm bridges. Rigidly connected diaphragm composite bridges are stiffer and stronger than simply connected diaphragm bridges. Furthermore, they have a better ability to distribute the load over the bridge under both service and ultimate loadings. The concrete deck slab also plays an important role in the transverse load distribution over the bridge. The results also revealed that there is an optimum number of the rigidly connected diaphragms in composite bridges beyond which no improvement in the load distribution should be expected. Connection types, load locations, aspect ratio of the bridge, sectional moment capacities, and the number of <b>transverse</b> <b>diaphragms</b> used influence the ultimate load capacity and the load distribution characteristics of composite bridges under service and ultimate loads. Comparison of the load distribution factors obtained from the finite element results and those of the Ontario Highway Bridge Design Code showed the code factors to be overly conservative.

40|$|The load {{distribution}} factor concept allows the design engineer {{to consider the}} longitudinal and transverse effects of wheel loads as two separate phenomena and thus simplifying the analysis and design of the bridge. North American codes of practice do not provide the design engineer with sufficient guidance regarding elastic {{load distribution}} factors for skew composite bridges. These codes of practice also require a check {{to be made on}} the strength of the sections of the bridge at the ultimate limit state, but they specify the use of elastic load distribution factors for the evaluation of the design forces at the ultimate limit state. Such specifications could lead to an extremely conservative design in some cases and to unsafe design in other cases, since these factors do not represent the actual behaviour of the bridge at that state. Under a moving truck, the bridge exhibits forces which are significantly greater than those under a static truck load. The Ontario Highway Bridge Design Code specifies the dynamic load allowance as a factor of the first flexural frequency of the bridge based on the beam theory. This latter theory is reliable in the case of right bridges without <b>transverse</b> <b>diaphragms.</b> However, in the case of skew bridges or bridges with <b>transverse</b> <b>diaphragms</b> the use of the beam theory leads to substantial errors in the determination of the first flexural frequency and hence the dynamic load allowance. In this dissertation, the predictions of the elastic and the ultimate behaviours of single span simply supported and continuous two-span skew composite steel-concrete bridges are presented. The dynamic response of such bridges is also investigated. A finite element analytical model based on the ABAQUS program, is used for the analyses. The analytical model was verified and substantiated by results from tests on six single span simply supported and three continuous skew composite steel-concrete bridge models. The finite element model is employed to conduct six extensive parametric studies on prototype skew composite bridges, including more than 2500 bridge cases. A statistical package for best fit is used to generate empirical formulas for the following: (i) elastic shear and moment distribution factors for simply supported and continuous skew composite bridges; (ii) ultimate span and support moment distribution factors for continuous skew composite bridges; and, (iii) first flexural frequency of such bridges. The following design parameters were considered when appropriate: angle of skew; bridge aspect ratio; girder spacing; number of lanes; number of girders; the effect of transverse intermediate diaphragms; longitudinal and transverse flexural rigidities; longitudinal and transverse ultimate moments of resistance of the bridge sections; eccentric and concentric truck loading cases; effect of dead load; and, the span ratio. From the results of this design oriented dissertation, the engineer would be able to design skew composite bridges more reliably and economically. Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} using piezoelectric {{material is}} not a new concept, but its generation capability has not been attractive for mass energy generation. For this reason, little research has been done on the topic. Recently, concepts such as wearable computers, as well as small portable electrical devices have re-ignited the study of piezoelectric energy harvesting. The theory behind cantilever type piezoelectric elements is well known, but <b>transverse</b> moving <b>diaphragm</b> elements, which can be used in pressure type energy generation have not been yet fully developed. Power generation in a diaphragm depends on several factors. Among them, the thickness of each layer, the poling direction, and stress distribution are most important. In this thesis, unimorph and triple-morph diaphragm structures with various poling configurations were considered. Their energy generation was calculated with varying thickness ratios and poling directions at various locations using piezoelectric constitutive equations. The results of this analysis are presented, along with experimental results that indicate that an optimal electrode pattern will result in maximum electrical energy generation...|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{analytical and}} experimental investigation was undertaken {{to study the}} load distribution characteristics of simply supported and two-equal-span continuous skew composite concrete slab on compact steel girder bridges. Detailed parametric studies were conducted to find the effect of several parameters upon the load distribution characteristics in skew bridges {{at different stages of}} loading. In this work, both the nonlinear finite element method and the yield-line theory were employed in the theoretical analyses. The finite element method was used to study the behaviour and response of skew composite bridges in the elastic and post-elastic ranges of loading. The nonlinear finite element analysis was also used to conduct a parametric study and to evaluate the ultimate-load capacity of skew bridges. Moreover, the analysis through yield-line theory was utilized to yield different general formulae to predict the failure load of skew composite bridges. The most probable failure patterns were based on both the experimental and parametric studies. Five small-scale models of four-girder and five-girder skew composite bridges were constructed and tested to failure in order to verify the analytical approaches and to study the load distribution characteristics of skew bridges with varying parameters. The tested models were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of three simply supported single span skew composite bridge models with an angle of skew of 45 ∘ while the second group consisted of two two-equal-span continuous skew composite bridge models with the same angle of skew as the first group. Good comparisons between the theoretical and experimental results for all five models were shown. The analysis of the results from the parametric study revealed that the ultimate-load capacity and the load distribution characteristics of skew composite bridges are influenced by several factors such as: angle of skew, aspect ratio of the bridge, load position, type of interconnection of different elements of the bridge, continuity, presence of <b>transverse</b> <b>diaphragms,</b> and the sectional moment capacities.

40|$|A new {{boundary}} residual mode-matching {{method is}} developed to find scattering solutions for an infinitely thin <b>transverse</b> iris (<b>diaphragm)</b> mounted in a waveguide (i. e., junction discontinuities). Differing dielectric constants are {{allowed on the}} two sides of the iris, and an optional transverse short placed behind the iris is also treated, allowing solutions useful in understanding planar grids used in microwave/millimeter wave power combining. The new method treats the edge-singularity of the iris (edge-condition) in both the electric and magnetic fields, and at each edge of a multi-edge iris, all simultaneously. This results in a rapidly-converging numerical solution, and oscillation-free transverse (electromagnetic) field plots (not available with methods that ignore singularity extraction). The solution is also free from relative convergence problems. Furthermore, the method when used without singularity extraction results in a formulation that is up to eight times faster than the standard boundary residual method, yet requires only one-fourth the memory, and is simpler to program. Singularity extraction further improves the speed and reduces memory requirements. In addition, extensions are made to Schwinger's variational formulas, resulting in formulas that produce highly-accurate answers for certain problems, even with multi-moding. A new type of problem is introduced, that of a triangular shaped iris, and the complicated inner product integrals are solved analytically in closed rational form. Theory and experiment are compared. A group of computer programs are developed to apply this new method, and the source code is listed and declared as "public domain. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{demonstrates}} {{the fact that}} in valuating the actual heat efficiency from utilizing the vortical heat-release intensification it is necessary to account for the increase of heatreleasing area of the tube with the corresponding lacunae (hollows, lunules). It may vary from 4 to 280 % as a function of their geometrical parameters which causes heat-release increasing with its simultaneous growth from vortex formation in the boundary-layer flow by the swirls generated by lunule turbulizers. For the tube of axial flow-around with hollows applied on the outer surface the vortex intensification enhances the thermal effectiveness up to 1, 39 times, {{and in the case of}} the transversal flow-around tube banks with lunuled tube outer surface it does not exceed 29 % at Re = 5000. With Re number growing to 14000 the energy effect tangibly declines to 6 %. The thermal effectiveness of the vortex intensification with spherical lunules on the tube inside surface and the air moving inside does not exceed 13 % in the interval Re = (1 − 2) ⋅ 104, which is distinctive for air the preheaters of steam-boilers. However, a greater energy effect (up to 33 %) for the axial flowing is attained from emerging saliences on the tube inside surface beneath the spherical lacunae on the outside.
