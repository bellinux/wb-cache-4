5|$|Another common {{disorder}} in male Pomeranians is cryptorchidism. This is when either {{one or both}} of the testicles do not descend into the scrotum. It is treated through surgical removal of the retained <b>testicle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Abnormal genitalia: usually {{cryptorchidism}} (retention of testicles in body) or monorchism (single <b>testicle).</b> In female patients, this presents {{as missing}} or single ovaries, much harder by nature to detect. Ultrasound imaging is performed at regular intervals, {{from the age}} of 1 year, to determine if ovaries are present.|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} been {{believed}} that a male black-throated blue warbler achieves reproductive maturation well into its first breeding season. A yearling participates in extra-pair mating and cuckoldry as much as or even more than older males. However, research by Graves has found opposing evidence in terms of testicular size and sperm production. Directional asymmetry is present in many passerine birds. The left <b>testicle</b> is often larger in size than the right one, and this holds true for both yearling and older male warblers. However, the <b>testicle</b> to body mass ratio nonetheless is much lower in yearlings than in older males. Moreover, older males have {{a greater degree of}} directional asymmetry than do yearlings. Because the size of testes in birds is correlated to the ejaculate quality, it is likely that females employ age-dependent choice in favor of older males who can be distinguished by their definitive age-specific plumage.|$|E

25|$|Both beaver <b>testicles</b> and castoreum, a bitter-tasting {{secretion}} with {{a slightly}} fetid odor contained in the castor sacs of male or female beaver, have been articles of trade for use in traditional medicine. Yupik medicine used dried beaver <b>testicles</b> like willow bark to relieve pain. Dried beaver <b>testicles</b> were also used as contraception. Beaver <b>testicles</b> were used as medicine in Iraq and Iran during the tenth to nineteenth century. Aesop's Fables comically describes beavers chewing off their <b>testicles</b> to preserve themselves from hunters, which is not possible because the beaver's <b>testicles</b> are inside its body. This belief, also recorded by Pliny the Elder, persisted in medieval bestiaries.|$|R
5000|$|Geoplanidae: non-expanded {{head and}} {{multiple}} eyes. It included three subfamilies: Geoplaninae, with dorsal <b>testicles</b> and strong subepithelial longitudinal muscles, Caenoplaninae, with ventral <b>testicles</b> and strong subepithelial longitudinal muscles, and Pelmatoplaninae, with ventral <b>testicles</b> and weak subepithelial longitudinal muscles.|$|R
5|$|In game five of {{the second}} round of the 2010 playoffs, Salo was hit in the groin by a slapshot from Chicago Blackhawks defenceman Duncan Keith. Needing to be helped off the ice, he was taken to {{hospital}} with what was falsely believed to be a ruptured <b>testicle.</b> He played through an undisclosed injury the following game, as the Canucks were eliminated by the Blackhawks by a 5–1 score. He completed the playoffs with a goal and six points in 12 post-season games.|$|E
5|$|In some North Indian images, {{the male}} half may be nude and also be ithyphallic (urdhavlinga or urdhavreta: with an erect phallus), {{or with a}} full or half phallus and one <b>testicle.</b> However, such imagery is never found in South Indian images; the loins are usually covered in a garment (sometimes a dhoti) of silk or cotton, or {{the skin of a}} tiger or deer), {{typically}} down to the knee, and held in place by a sarpa-mekhala, serpent girdle or jewellery. The right leg may be somewhat bent or straight and often rests on a lotus pedestal (padma-pitha). The whole right half is described as smeared with ashes and as terrible and red-coloured or gold or coral in appearance; however, these features are rarely depicted.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{are about}} three times larger than mouse lemurs, {{weighing}} approximately , and have a long, bushy tail. They are most closely related to mouse lemurs within Cheirogaleidae, a family of small, nocturnal lemurs. Giant mouse lemurs sleep in nests {{during the day and}} forage alone at night for fruit, tree gum, insects, and small vertebrates. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they do not enter a state of torpor during the dry season. The northern species is generally more social than the southern species, particularly when nesting, though males and females may form pair bonds. The northern species also has the largest <b>testicle</b> size relative to its body size among all primates and is atypical among lemurs for breeding year-round instead of seasonally. Home ranges often overlap, with related females living closely together while males disperse. Giant mouse lemurs are vocal, although they also scent mark using saliva, urine, and secretions from the anogenital scent gland.|$|E
5000|$|A triple crown is {{a special}} cock-ring that has {{additional}} rings for restraining the <b>testicles.</b> In orgasm, the <b>testicles</b> usually retract toward the body before ejaculation. A triple crown changes and intensifies the sensation of orgasm by forcing the <b>testicles</b> {{to stay away from}} the body.|$|R
40|$|The <b>testicles</b> of prostatics cancer (10 cases), p rostatic {{hypertrophy}} (18 cases), and {{the control}} cases of none prostatic disease (above 40 years) were examined histologically and histochemically by the needle biopsies or autopsies. In the <b>testicles</b> of prostatic cancer ard hypertrophy, the decrease or disappearance of germ cells, the thickening of basement membrane of seminiferous tubules, the proliferation of connective tissue of stroma were observed. Above changes of these <b>testicles</b> were nonspecific one and detected commonly in aged <b>testicles.</b> However these changes of <b>testicles</b> were generally more mild {{than that of the}} control cases. According to these findings, it was presumed these <b>testicles</b> in prostatic cancer and hypertrophy had a relatively good function. In the cancer <b>testicles</b> of 5 out 10 cases treated with high dosis of estrogen administration, more marked decrease of germ cells, thickening of basement membrane of seminiferous tubules, proliferation of stroma, atrophy and decreasing tendency in number of interstitial cells of Leydig, increase of large lipid granules in the seminiferous tubules and stroma, decrease of alkaline phosphatase reaction in semis iferous tubules were observed...|$|R

25|$|The initial {{treatment}} for testicular cancer is {{surgery to remove}} the affected <b>testicle</b> (orchiectomy). While it may be possible, in some cases, to remove testicular cancer tumors from a testis while leaving the testis functional, this is almost never done, as the affected <b>testicle</b> usually contains pre-cancerous cells spread throughout the entire <b>testicle.</b> Thus removing the tumor alone without additional treatment greatly increases the risk that another cancer will form in that <b>testicle.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} common {{surgical}} approaches are retroperitoneal (abdominal using laparoscopic surgery), infrainguinal/subinguinal (below the groin) and inguinal (groin using percutaneous embolization). Possible complications {{of this procedure}} include hematoma (bleeding into tissues), hydrocele (accumulation of fluid around the affected <b>testicle),</b> infection, or injury to the scrotal tissue or structures. In addition, injury to the artery that supplies the <b>testicle</b> may occur, resulting {{in a loss of}} a <b>testicle.</b>|$|E
25|$|On July 23, 1988, Rick Gibson ate {{the flesh}} of another person in public. Because England {{does not have a}} {{specific}} law against cannibalism, he legally ate a canapé of donated human tonsils in Walthamstow High Street, London. A year later, on April 15, 1989, he publicly ate a slice of human <b>testicle</b> in Lewisham High Street, London. When he tried to eat another slice of human <b>testicle</b> at the Pitt International Galleries in Vancouver on July 14, 1989, the Vancouver police confiscated the <b>testicle</b> hors d'œuvre. However, the charge of publicly exhibiting a disgusting object was dropped and he finally ate the piece of human <b>testicle</b> {{on the steps of the}} Vancouver court house on September 22, 1989.|$|E
50|$|The <b>testicles</b> are {{the male}} gonads where sperm and male hormones are {{produced}}. Millions of sperm are produced daily in several hundred seminiferous tubules. Cells called the Leydig cells lie between the tubules; these produce hormones called androgens; these consist of testosterone and inhibin. The <b>testicles</b> {{are held by}} the spermatic cord, which is a tubelike structure containing blood vessels, nerves, the vas deferens, and a muscle that helps to raise and lower the <b>testicles</b> in response to temperature changes and sexual arousal, in which the <b>testicles</b> are drawn closer to the body.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe highest CK 2 {{activity}} {{was found in}} mouse <b>testicles</b> and brain, followed by spleen, liver, lung, kidney and heart. The activity values were directly correlated with the protein expression level of the CK 2 subunits α (catalytic) and β (regulatory). The α′ subunit was only detected in brain and <b>testicles.</b> By contrast, Northern blot analyses of the CK 2 α mRNA revealed a somewhat different picture. Here, the strongest signals were obtained for brain, liver, heart and lung. In kidney, spleen and <b>testicles</b> mRNAs were only weakly detectable. For CK 2 α′ mRNA distribution strong signals were observed for lung, liver and <b>testicles.</b> In the case of CK 2 β mRNA the highest signals were found for <b>testicles,</b> kidney, brain and liver. The amount of CK 2 β mRNA in <b>testicles</b> {{was estimated to be}} about 6 -fold higher than in brain. The strongest CK 2 β signals in the Western blot were found for <b>testicles</b> and brain. The amount of CK 2 β protein in brain in comparison to the other organs (except <b>testicles)</b> was estimated to be ca. 2 – 3 -fold higher whereas the ratio of CK 2 β between <b>testicles</b> and brain was estimated to be 3 – 4 -fold. Results from the immunoprecipitation experiments support the notion for the existence of free CK 2 β population and/or CK 2 β in complex with other protein(s) present in brain and <b>testicles.</b> In all other mouse organs investigated, i. e. heart, lung, liver, kidney and spleen, no comparable amount of free CK 2 β was observed. This is the first physiological evidence for the existence of a ‘free CK 2 β’ (or in complex with proteins other than CK 2 α) in normal animal tissue apart from the hitherto dogmatic association with CK 2 α in a tetrameric holoenzyme complex...|$|R
50|$|The only adult tissue Rex1 {{has been}} {{identified}} in are the <b>testicles.</b> Using in situ hybridization {{it was determined that}} the spermatocytes in the more inner layers of the <b>testicles</b> are expressing Rex1. Thus, the male germ cells undergoing meiosis are the specific cells in the <b>testicles</b> that express Rex1. It has not been observed, however, that Rex1 is expressed in the female germ cells.|$|R

25|$|The {{testicles}} are well-known to be {{very sensitive}} to impact and injury. The pain involved travels up from each <b>testicle</b> into the abdominal cavity, via the spermatic plexus, which is the primary nerve of each <b>testicle.</b> This will cause pain in the hip and the back. The pain usually goes away in a few minutes.|$|E

50|$|Orchiectomy (also named orchidectomy, and {{sometimes}} shortened as orchi) is a surgical procedure {{in which one}} or both <b>testicles</b> are removed. The removal of both <b>testicles</b> (bilateral orchiectomy) is the surgical form of male castration.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the possible development of histological abnormalities such as fibrosis and microcalcifications after sperm retrieval in a ram model. Fourteen <b>testicles</b> in nine rams were exposed to open biopsy, multiple TESAs, or TESE, and the remaining four <b>testicles</b> were left unoperated on as controls. Three months after sperm retrieval, the <b>testicles</b> were removed, fixed, and cut into 1 / 2 [*]cm thick slices and systematically put onto a glass plate exposing macroscopic abnormalities. Tissue from abnormal areas was cut into 3 [*]μm sections and stained for histological evaluation. Pathological abnormalities were observed in <b>testicles</b> exposed to sperm retrieval (≥ 11 of 14) compared to 0 of 4 control <b>testicles.</b> Testicular damage was found independently of the kind of intervention used. Therefore, cryopreservation of excess sperm should be considered while retrieving sperm...|$|R
50|$|Like the penis, sperm {{competition}} {{has caused the}} human <b>testicles</b> to evolve in size through sexual selection. This means that large <b>testicles</b> are {{an example of a}} sexually selected adaptation. The human <b>testicles</b> are moderately sized when compared to other animals such as gorillas and chimpanzees, placing somewhere midway. Large <b>testicles</b> are advantageous in {{sperm competition}} due to their ability to produce a bigger ejaculation. Research has shown that a positive correlation exists between the number of sperm ejaculated and testis size. Larger testes have also been shown to predict higher sperm quality, including a larger number of motile sperm and higher sperm motility.|$|R

50|$|One {{potential}} roadblock to injecting a woman's {{cells into}} a man's <b>testicles</b> {{is that the}} man's immune system might attack and destroy the woman's cells. In usual circumstances, when foreign cells (such as cells/organs from other people, or infectious bacteria) are injected into the human body, the immune system will reject such cells. However, a special property of a man's <b>testicles</b> {{is that they are}} immune-privileged, that is, a man's immune system will not attack foreign cells (such as a woman's cells) injected into the sperm-producing part of the <b>testicles.</b> Thus, a woman's cells will remain in the man's <b>testicles</b> long enough to be converted into sperm.|$|R
50|$|The Burdizzo is a {{castration}} device {{which employs}} a large clamp designed {{to break the}} blood vessels leading into the <b>testicles.</b> Once the blood supply to the <b>testicles</b> is lost, testicular necrosis occurs, and the <b>testicles</b> shrink, soften, and eventually deteriorate completely. When the device is used, the operator crushes the spermatic cords one at a time, leaving a space in between {{in order to maintain}} an interruption of blood-flow to the scrotum.|$|R
50|$|The {{ring and}} cage are usually secured {{together}} with a lock. When the device is locked, the <b>testicles</b> are trapped in {{the gap between the}} ring and the penis cage which is narrow enough to prevent the <b>testicles</b> and penis from being pulled out. The <b>testicles</b> are usually held in a fixed position, exposed beneath the cage although some designs have an additional cup that prevents easy access to the entire genital area.|$|R

25|$|The cremasteric {{muscle is}} part of the spermatic cord. When this muscle contracts, the cord is {{shortened}} and the <b>testicle</b> is moved closer up toward the body, which provides slightly more warmth to maintain optimal testicular temperature. When cooling is required, the cremasteric muscle relaxes and the <b>testicle</b> is lowered away from the warm body and is able to cool. Contraction also occurs in response to stress (the testicles rise up toward the body in an effort to protect them in a fight). There are persistent reports that relaxation indicates approach of orgasm. There is a noticeable tendency to also retract during orgasm.|$|E
25|$|Former Indiana {{basketball}} player Todd Jadlow {{has written a}} book alleging that from 1985 to 1989 former IU coach Bob Knight punched him, broke a clipboard over his head, and squeezed his <b>testicles</b> and the <b>testicles</b> of other Hoosiers, among other abuses.|$|R
40|$|The <b>testicles</b> {{of white}} male rabbits which w e ight about 2 kg {{administrated}} for 3 weeks synthetic estrogen (Robal 1 - 2 mg daily. Suron 1 - 2. 5 mg daily), androgen (Enarmon : 2. 5 mg daily), corticoids (Cortisone : 12. 5 mg daily) were examined histologically and histochemically. The {{weight of the}} rabbit <b>testicles</b> decreased markedly when synthetic estrogen or androgen was administrated. The more marked histological and histochemical changes of <b>testicles</b> were observed {{in the group of}} the administration of high dosis of estrogen than in the group of small dosis of estrogen. Also, the changes of <b>testicles</b> were almost identical in both group of androgen administration and estrogen. In the cortisone administration, the changes of <b>testicles</b> were almost similar, but relatively slight. In the interstitial cells of Leydig in these rabbits administrated estrogen, androgen and cortisone, any changes were not observed. However, interstitial cell lipids and alkaline phosphatase reaction decreased after the estrogen and androgen administration, but no changes after the cortisone. The 17 ketosteroids in urine decreased after estrogen administration and increased after androgen and cortisone administration. According to the above results, it was presumed that high dosis of the estrogen administration temporarily repressed the androgen secretion from <b>testicles</b> but could not be used in place of castration...|$|R
