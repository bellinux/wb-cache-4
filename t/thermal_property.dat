Affective haptic devices produce different senses of touch including kinesthetic and coetaneous channels. Kinesthetic stimulations, which are produced by forces exerted on the body, are sensed by mechanoreceptors in the tendons and muscles. On the other hand, mechanoreceptors in the skin layers are responsible for the perception of cutaneous stimulation. Different types of tactile corpuscles allow us sensing <b>thermal</b> <b>property</b> of the object, pressure, vibration frequency, and stimuli location.|$|E
50|$|This {{large amount}} of {{reinforcement}} surface area means that a relatively small amount of nanoscale reinforcement can have an observable effect on the macroscale properties of the composite. For example, adding carbon nanotubes improves the electrical and thermal conductivity. Other kinds of nanoparticulates may result in enhanced optical properties, dielectric properties, heat resistance or mechanical properties such as stiffness, strength and resistance to wear and damage. In general, the nano reinforcement is dispersed into the matrix during processing. The percentage by weight (called mass fraction) of the nanoparticulates introduced can remain very low (on the order of 0.5% to 5%) due to the low filler percolation threshold, especially for {{the most commonly used}} non-spherical, high aspect ratio fillers (e.g. nanometer-thin platelets, such as clays, or nanometer-diameter cylinders, such as carbon nanotubes). The orientation and arrangement of asymmetric nanoparticles, <b>thermal</b> <b>property</b> mismatch at the interface, interface density per unit volume of nanocomposite, and polydispersity of nanoparticles significantly affect the effective thermal conductivity of nanocomposites.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFrozen soils cover {{about 40}} % {{of the land}} surface on the earth and are {{responsible}} for the global energy balances affecting the climate. Measurement of the <b>thermal</b> <b>properties</b> of frozen soils during phase transition is important for analyzing the thermal transport process. Due to the involvement of phase transition, the <b>thermal</b> <b>properties</b> of frozen soils are rather complex. This paper introduces the uses of a multifunctional instrument that integrates time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensor and thermal pulse technology (TPT) to measure the <b>thermal</b> <b>properties</b> of soil during phase transition. With this method, the extent of phase transition (freezing/thawing) was measured with the TDR module; and the corresponding <b>thermal</b> <b>properties</b> were measured with the TPT module. Therefore, the variation of <b>thermal</b> <b>properties</b> with the extent of freezing/thawing can be obtained. Wet soils were used to demonstrate the performance of this measurement method. The performance of individual modules was first validated with designed experiments. The new sensor was then used to monitor the properties of soils during freezing–thawing process, from which the freezing/thawing degree and <b>thermal</b> <b>properties</b> were simultaneously measured. The results are consistent with documented trends of <b>thermal</b> <b>properties</b> variations...|$|R
