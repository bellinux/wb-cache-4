40|$|A {{financial}} institution involved in commercial lending makes a short-term loan (for example, 90 days) to a borrower under a long-term credit commitment (for example, 5 years). The {{financial institution}} transfers the short-term loan, without recourse, to a <b>third-party</b> <b>purchaser</b> {{for the remaining}} term of the loan. The risk of loss relating to the short-term loan is legally transferred to the purchaser, and the financial institution has no contractual obligation to repurchase the shortterm loan. Under the long-term credit commitment, the financial institution may, at the maturity of the short-term loan, relend to the borrower. However, the financial institution may refuse to relend to the borrower based on a current credit evaluation or if any covenant under the long-term commitment is not satisfied. The issue is whether {{the transfer of the}} short-term loan should be accounted for as a sale or as a financing. Copyright © 2010, Financial Accounting Standards Board Not for redistributio...|$|E
40|$|In {{connection}} with a troubled debt restructuring, a debtor, with the creditor's approval, sells the collateral (real estate) on a contract for deed for a purchase price, the present value {{is less than the}} creditor's net investment in the related loan. The creditor does not release its lien on the property. The seller-debtor provides 100 percent financing for the <b>third-party</b> <b>purchaser,</b> with payment terms identical to the seller-debtor's obligation under the restructured terms. The thirdparty purchaser must make the monthly payments directly to the creditor and not to the sellerdebtor. The issue is whether the sale of collateral and related requirement for the purchaser to make payments directly to the creditor warrant the creditor's recognition of a loss related to the amount by which the net investment in the loan exceeds the fair value of the payments to be received from the purchaser. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that the creditor should recognize a loss on the disposition of the original loan and record an asset for the fair value of the payments to be received from the purchaser. Under paragraph 28 of Statement 15, the loss would be measured as the amount by which the creditor's net investment in the loan exceeds the fair value of the assets received in full Copyright © 1987, Financial Accounting Standards Board Not for redistribution age 1 satisfaction of the debt. Some Task Force members considered the transaction to be an insubstance foreclosure or settlement of the loan pursuant to paragraph 34 of Statement 15. Others viewed it as the addition or substitution of a debtor pursuant to paragraph 42 of Statement 15. Some Task Force members commented that the creditor should not be able to avoid loss recognition by refraining from legal foreclosure even though the creditor has effectively repossessed the original collateral by approving its sale and requiring the purchaser's payments to be made directly to the creditor...|$|E
40|$|A great {{proportion}} of inefficiencies the health systems {{need to deal}} with arise from the behaviour of the health sector actors. This thesis will focus on the behaviour of health care providers and some of the existing tools which might help to eliminate inefficiencies their behaviour causes. The crucial hypothesis this paper was built upon concerns the imperfect agency problem of the health care providers. The attention is paid to a particular sort of tools represented by various payment mechanisms implemented in the health systems within the relationship between the health care providers and the <b>third-party</b> <b>purchasers.</b> The paper revises some of the most common payment methods, their diversity, advantages and limitations. This thesis presents a simple theoretical model which provides a comparison of some payment mechanisms focusing on their enhancement of cost-efficiency, prevention, creation of waiting lists and production of health care. The analysis is based on utility functions of three important actors of the health systems; health care providers, <b>third-party</b> <b>purchasers</b> and patients...|$|R

Cases such as ER Ives Investments Ltd v High and Crabb v Arun District Council have been offered in support of their existence; however, some commentators prefer to analyse these cases as giving rise to a right distinct from an easement or a legal easement respectively. This makes an important difference {{when it comes to}} binding <b>third-party</b> <b>purchasers.</b>|$|R
40|$|In many (predominantly) {{publicly}} financed {{health care}} systems market-oriented health care reforms are being implemented or have been proposed. The purpose of these reforms is to make resource allocation in health care more efficient, more innovative and more responsive to consumers preferences while maintaining equity. At the same time, the advances in technology result in a divergence of consumers' preferences with respect to health care and urge society to (re) think {{about the meaning of}} the solidarity principle in health care. In this paper we indicate some international trends in health care reforms and explore some potential future options. From an international perspective we can observe a trend towards universal mandatory health insurance, contracts between <b>third-party</b> <b>purchasers</b> and the providers of care, competition among providers of care and a strengthening of primary care. These trends can be expected to continue. A more controversial issue is whether there should also be competition among the <b>third-party</b> <b>purchasers</b> and whether in the long run there will occur a convergence towards some "ideal" model. Although regulated competition in health care can be expected to yield more value for money, it might yield both more efficiency and higher total costs. It has been argued that equity can be maintained in a competitive health care system if we interpret equity as "equal access to cost-effective care within a reasonable period of time". Because the effectiveness of care has to be considered in relation to the medical indication and the condition of the patient, the responsibility for cost-effective care rests primarily with the providers of care. Guidelines and protocols should be developed by the profession and sustained by financial incentives embedded in contracts. It has been argued that the <b>third-party</b> <b>purchasers</b> could start to concentrate on the contracts with the primary care physicians. Contracts with other providers could then be a natural complement to these contracts. Coordinated-care contracts between the <b>third-party</b> <b>purchasers</b> and the consumer of care could provide the consumer with monetary incentives to go to efficient providers. A consumer choice of insurance contract could give the consumer an opportunity to make important choices in health care. However, each society has to make its own choices about what care should be available to everybody independent of an individual's purchasing power. health care reforms regulated competition cost-effectiveness choices in health care...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine how}} public sector <b>third-party</b> <b>purchasers</b> and {{hospitals}} negotiate quality targets when a fixed proportion of hospital revenue {{is required to}} be linked to quality. We develop a bargaining model linking the number of quality targets to purchaser and hospital characteristics. Using data extracted from 153 contracts for acute hospital services in England in 2010 / 11, we find that the number of quality targets is associated with the purchaser’s population health and its budget, the hospital type, whether the purchaser delegated negotiation to an agency, and the quality targets imposed by the supervising regional health authority...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} some of {{the difficulties}} arising from how English law conceptualises certain types of security interests over IPRs, and the problems arising from dual registration systems. This analysis is informed by a critical comparison of the current English doctrine, alongside the US system and the proposals from UNCITRAL. It is argued that attempts to regulate a world of integrated goods (whereby goods and software are inextricably interconnected), through unintegrated regimes of legal governance of security interests over goods and IPRs, is unsustainable. It will thus be argued that reform of security interest law generally (to bring about a functional system of security) and a single register for security interests whether over goods or IPRs is necessary. Specific recommendations to deal with problems concerning purchase money security interests, and <b>third-party</b> <b>purchasers,</b> are put forward...|$|R
40|$|Objectives China's {{government}} {{has decided to}} increase government funding by 1 - 1. 5 % of the Gross Domestic Products {{in the health care}} sector. However, it is still a question how to turn the new funding into efficient health care. Methods To help to answer this question we analyze three prototype models of organizing the health care system that may be relevant for China, namely the "Government provision model", the "regulated market with non-competing third-party purchasers", and the "regulated market with competing third-party purchasers". The pre- and post-reform English health care system and the present Dutch health care system are used as examples of the three models. During the last 20 years these countries had, just as China, major health care reforms from a national centrally planned system to a market-based system. Based on the experiences in these countries we analyze {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these three prototype models and discuss their relevance for China. Results and conclusions We conclude that the creation of prudent <b>third-party</b> <b>purchasers,</b> who have the incentive and ability to act on behalf of individual consumers, is a critical success factor, whatever model China chooses to implement.

5000|$|The State Commission for Regulating Social Policy {{was set up}} {{as part of the}} 2000-2009 Strategic Health Plan of Georgia. It reports {{directly}} to the President and provides guidance to the Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs, the National Health Management Center, regional health departments, and other health-related sectors. In 1999, the Ministry of Health joined with the Ministry of Social Welfare to become the Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs. It is responsible for {{the development and implementation of}} government policy on health care and medical research. In 1995, the Ministry changed its emphasis from tertiary healthcare to support for preventative activities, as well as regulation and accreditation of health services and training. The MoLHSA manages the public health services provided to the poorest population, but the role of government in regulating healthcare and financial transactions has been greatly reduced since 2003. Its approach has been to allow market mechanisms to regulate the relationships between patients, providers, and <b>third-party</b> <b>purchasers.</b> The role of the National Health Management Center is to provide scientific and technical input into the process of health sector reform, and it works directly with both international and local nongovernmental organizations. There are twelve regional health departments, along with twelve Regional Commissions for Regulating Social Processes. In each region, there are also health committees made up of people who represent different sectors that influence health within that region.There are 65 municipalities in Georgia. Each municipality administers a municipal health fund, from which money is channeled to the regional health fund on a per person basis.Georgia also receives substantial external health financing from sources such as the United Nations, the World Bank, nongovernmental organizations, and other countries, including Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{decades of}} {{intervention}} to promote equal pay, the gender wage gap in Australia persists. A key {{explanation is that}} equal pay strategies have had limited capacity to address the subtle, historical undervaluation that keep wages low in highly feminized areas of employment, especially where care work is performed. In this article, we examine a recent attempt to address the undervaluation of care work through a test case of the expanded equal remuneration clause in the Fair Work Act 2009. A highly feminized area of employment, the social and community services industry proved a strategic context for the case. We discuss three significant aspects of the case: the recognition given to the undervaluation of care work; the divergent interests of non-government sector employers and business associations; and strong contestation over who should pay, arising from the government's <b>third-party</b> role as <b>purchaser</b> of social and community services. 9 page(s...|$|R
