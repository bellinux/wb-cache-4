5|$|The K'iche' rebuilt over earlier Classic period {{structures}} in a distinctively K'iche' style. The basic K'iche layout {{consists of a}} westward-facing temple with a steep talud-tablero facade, flanked by two unequally sized wings.

This K'iche' layout was somewhat distorted by the reuse of the earlier architecture, because the typical Mam settlement layout was built along an axis running from southeast to northwest. As the K'iche' did not completely redesign the entire site along a K'iche' pattern, the juxtaposition of Mam- and K'iche'-style complexes demonstrates the fusing of <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>and</b> intrusive elite lineages.|$|E
