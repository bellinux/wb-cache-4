Lundy has cool, wet winters and mild, wet summers. It is often windy. Fog is a continual experience. The record high {{temperature}} is 28.8°C (83.8°F) on 2 August 1990, and the record low temperature is -4.5°C (23.9°F) recorded just six months later on 7 February 1991.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} {{her mother had}} died, and Bryher had {{divorced}} her husband, only to marry H.D.'s new male lover, Kenneth Macpherson. H.D., Bryher, and Macpherson lived together and traveled through Europe as what the poet and critic Barbara Guest termed in her biography of H.D. as a 'menagerie of three.' Bryher and Macpherson adopted H.D.'s daughter, Perdita. In 1928, H.D. became pregnant but chose to abort the pregnancy in November. Bryher and Macpherson set up the magazine Close Up (to which H.D. regularly contributed) as a medium for intellectual discussion of cinema. In 1927, the small independent film cinema group POOL or Pool Group was established (largely funded with Bryher's inheritance) and was managed by all three. Only one POOL film survives in its entirety, Borderline (1930), which featured H.D. and Paul Robeson in the lead roles. In common with <b>the</b> <b>Borderline</b> novellas, the film explores extreme psychic states {{and their relationship to}} surface reality. As well as acting in this film, H.D. wrote an explanatory pamphlet to accompany it, a piece later published in Close Up.|$|E
5|$|Jim Thompson {{was hired}} by Foster and McQueen to adapt his novel. He worked on the {{screenplay}} for four months, changing some of the scenes and episodes in his novel. Thompson's script included <b>the</b> <b>borderline</b> surrealistic ending from his novel featuring El Rey, an imaginary Mexican town filled with criminals. McQueen objected to the depressing ending and Thompson was replaced by screenwriter Walter Hill. Hill had been recommended by Polly Platt, Bogdanovich's wife, who was then still attached to direct; Platt had been impressed by Hill's work on Hickey & Boggs (1972). Hill said Bogdanovich wanted to turn the material into a more Hitchcock-type thriller, but he had only gotten twenty-five pages in when McQueen fired the director. Hill finished the script in six weeks, then Peckinpah came on board.|$|E

5|$|The National Hurricane Center began issuing {{hurricane}} warnings {{early on}} August 14, anticipating that Beryl would reach hurricane strength. The warnings were issued along the Texas coast from Baffin Bay to the United StatesMexico border. The Government of Mexico issued hurricane warnings from <b>the</b> <b>borderline</b> south to La Pesca. The hurricane warnings issued stretched for 230miles (370km) along the coast. Mexico also issued {{a tropical storm}} warning south of La Pesca to Tampico. A storm surge of 2 to 5feet (0.6m to 1.5m) was expected along the coast near and {{to the north of}} Beryl’s center. Rainfall between 5 and 10inches (125 to 250mm) were also expected. Thousands of residents in coastal areas of southern Texas and northern Mexico were asked {{to pay attention to the}} hurricane warnings and to move towards higher ground. The National Weather Service warned the cities of Cameron and Kenedy, and Willacy County in southern Texas that severe flooding is the deadliest threat associated with the storm. In low-lying rural areas near the mouth of the Rio Grande, an estimated 20,000 residents were urged to seek shelter, as the inadequate drainage in these areas make them in danger to severe flooding. The National Weather Service also warned of possible tornadoes forming when associated with thunderstorms and tropical storm generated winds. Authorities in southern Texas filled 20,000 sandbags along the shores, and closed government offices. Residents nailed plywood on windows, parks were temporarily closed, and documents were transferred to waterproof storage areas.|$|E

25|$|One curiosity on the Canada–U.S. {{border is}} the {{presence}} of six airports that straddle <b>the</b> <b>borderline.</b> The airports were built prior to the U.S. entry into World War II as a way to legally transfer U.S.-built aircraft such as the Lockheed Hudson to Canada under the provisions of the Lend-Lease Act. In the interest of maintaining neutrality, U.S. military pilots were forbidden to deliver combat aircraft to Canada. The aircraft were flown to the border, landed, and then at night towed on their wheels over the border by tractors or horses. The next day the planes were crewed by RCAF pilots and flown to other locations, typically airbases in Eastern Canada, from where they were often flown to the United Kingdom and deployed in the Battle of the Atlantic.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, James F. Masterson {{proposed}} {{two categories}} for pathological narcissism, exhibitionist and closet. Both fail to adequately develop an age- and phase- appropriate self because of defects {{in the quality}} of psychological nurturing provided, usually by the mother. The exhibitionist narcissist is the one described in DSM-IV and differs from the closet narcissist in several important ways. The closet narcissist {{is more likely to be}} described as having a deflated, inadequate self-perception and greater awareness of emptiness within. The exhibitionist narcissist would be described as having an inflated, grandiose self-perception with little or no conscious awareness of the emptiness within. Such a person would assume that this condition was normal and that others were just like him. The closet narcissist seeks constant approval from others and appears similar to <b>the</b> <b>borderline</b> in the need to please others. The exhibitionist narcissist seeks perfect admiration all the time from others.|$|E
25|$|The first men {{to travel}} this {{route to the}} summit were the Chinese in 1960, along the Northeast Ridge. The British since 1922 had made their ascent {{attempts}} significantly down the ridge, crossed the giant north face to the Great Couloir (later called the “Norton couloir”), climbed along <b>the</b> <b>borderline</b> of the couloir, and then attempted to reach the summit pyramid. This route was unsuccessful until Reinhold Messner followed it for his solo ascent in 1980. The exact route of the Mallory and Irvine ascent is not known. They either used the natural Norton/Harris route—cutting diagonally through the Yellow Band ledges to the Northeast Ridge or, possibly, following the North Ridge straight up to the Northeast Ridge. It is unknown whether either of them reached the summit. The diagonal traverse of the northern face to breach the Second Step strata through {{the beginning of the}} Great (Norton) Couloir was a potential alternative to the ridge route, but it is rarely used.|$|E

40|$|In this globalised {{world where}} people of {{different}} cultures are interspersing at an increasing rate, many individuals of mixed cultural heritage are searching {{for a sense of}} belonging. While some are content to move from one culture to another, others find themselves on <b>the</b> <b>borderlines</b> or in-between cultures. Through visual art, some of these individuals have expressed their identity through a mix of cultural and other influences. As one of these individuals, I concentrate on these borderline or in-between cultural spaces in trying to understand this position of uncertainty. This research project investigates multiple identity constructions of Australians with Chinese heritage, in particular, those born in Australia. My investigation is motivated by the following questions: How do influences on the diverse cultural identity constructions of Australian-born Chinese affect their sense of belonging, particularly in <b>the</b> <b>borderlines</b> between cultures? How can printmaking be used in innovative ways to express this diversity and represent the persistent search for a sense of place? The central premise is that many individuals oscillate amongst a variety of identity spaces, searching for balance on <b>the</b> <b>borderlines</b> of various cultures. Through my studio practice I have created ‘hybrid’ or fusion artworks, merging different imagery of the Australian and Chinese landscapes through various media, exploring multiple roles of printmaking as a traditional as well as modern art-form. These works are informed by other contemporary Chinese- Australian visual artists. The results of this studio practice are realised in an installation exhibition entitled Balancing on <b>Borderlines.</b> <b>The</b> exegesis encompasses an interdisciplinary approach including history, cultural studies and visual arts. The historical and cultural studies frameworks provide a theoretical background for my studio practice. An explanation of the creative process and progression of studio work connects the theoretical background and conceptual framework with the body of artwork to explore ‘oscillation’ of identity...|$|R
