40|$|We analyse {{the noise}} of the edge current of a generic {{fractional}} quantum Hall state in a tunnelling point contact system. We show that the non-symmetrized noise in the edge current for the system out-of-equilibrium is completely determined by the noise in the <b>tunnelling</b> <b>current</b> and the Nyquist- Johnson (equilibrium) noise of the edge current.

This can be applied to STM by making the electrodes the tip and sample, assigning ψ and χ as sample and tip wave functions, respectively, and evaluating M at some surface S between the metal electrodes, where z=0 at the sample surface and z=W at the tip surface.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The filling {{fraction}} 1 /k double layered quantum Hall {{state has}} been shown to exhibit many superfluid properties including the appearance of an alternating <b>tunnelling</b> <b>current</b> in response to an external voltage V. Here we propose the notion of “sideways tunnelling”, in which a <b>current</b> <b>tunnels</b> between two such 1 /k states through an incompressible fractional quantum Hall state of filling fraction 2 /m. We predict an alter-nating <b>tunnelling</b> <b>current</b> or a narrow band noise at a frequency ω = eVh̄m, {{as a consequence of the}} tunnelling of e/m fractional charges. We also discuss singularities in the <b>tunnelling</b> <b>current</b> noise spectrum and the non-linear I-V curve. * Published in Europhys. Lett. 35, 227 (1996) In Ref. 1 we predicted within the semiclassical approximation and in the weak tun-nelling limit, that a DC voltage V applied across a double-layered quantum Hall system 2 in certain special states (to be characterized below) would produce a <b>tunnelling</b> <b>current</b> alternating with frequency ω = eV/h̄. While our effect is reminiscent of the Josephson effect 3 there are some important differences. Here the frequency is half of the Josephson frequency: the charge carrier is not a pair of electrons as in a superconductor. 4 We claimed that there is a superfluid lurking in certain states of double-layered quantum Hall systems. In this paper, we propose and discuss a novel notion of “sideways tunnelling ” involving the juxtaposition of three double layered quantum Hall systems.
