40|$|Abstract― ― Timing jitter in M-PAM, M-ASK and M 2 -QAM with AWGN is {{calculated}} for a cosine roll-off bandlimiting scheme applying a closed form {{representation in the}} frequency domain of the jitter power spectral density (jitter PSD) which the authors derived. Jitter PSD consists of SS, SN and NN components. Each component of jitter variance is obtained by integrating the corresponding jitter PSD over a finite frequency domain in a bandlimiting scheme. <b>The</b> <b>total</b> jitter <b>variance</b> is obtained as the sum of three components. The dependencies of calculated jitter variance on the system parameters: SNR, ρ, alphabet size, M, transmission scheme, PLL normalized noise bandwidth, bL, and roll-off factor, α, are evaluated. Particularly, the SS component increases with increasing M. However, this increase is limited within a finite range. Since the SN and NN components are independent of M, the dependence of <b>the</b> <b>total</b> jitter <b>variance</b> on M is small. At low and medium SNRs, <b>the</b> <b>total</b> jitter <b>variance</b> is independent of M. At high SNRs, <b>the</b> <b>total</b> jitter <b>variance</b> increases with increasing M, but the increase is rather small when M is greater than 4.

40|$|The {{tropical}} Atlantic Ocean exhibits several {{modes of}} interannual variability {{such as the}} equatorial (or Atlantic Niño) mode, and meridional (or Atlantic dipole) mode. Nonlinear principal component analysis (NLPCA) is applied on detrended monthly Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly (SSTA) data from the tropical Atlantic Ocean (30 °W - 20 °E, 26 °S - 22 °N) for the period 1950 to 2005. The objective is to compare the modes extracted through this statistical analysis to those previously extracted through simpler principal component analysis (PCA). It is shown that the first NLPCA mode explains 38 % of <b>the</b> <b>total</b> SST <b>variance</b> compared to 36 % by the first PCA while the second NLPCA mode explains 22 % of <b>the</b> <b>total</b> SST <b>variance</b> compared to 16 % by the second PCA.

40|$|Wind {{waves in}} the {{vicinity}} of Cape Town, South Africa, were measured by means of an N. I. O. (England) ship-borne wave recorder, in water depths varying from 12 - 140 metres. One dimensional frequency spectra were computed from the records, by power spectrum analysis, based on the method of Blackman and Tukey, using an I. B. M. 1130 Computer. Assumptions of normality and stationarity were tested. The Gaussian assumption of the waves was found to be acceptable for the waters off Cape Town. At the 5 % critical level, using the chi-square test, 3 out of 23 records tested were found to be non-Gaussian. No significant difference between the Gaussian properties of the deep and the shallow stations was found. Tests for stationarity applied to 3 selected records showed 1 record as clearly non-stationary. However, this recording was obtained under fluctuating wind conditions. Comparison of <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>variances</b> of <b>the</b> power spectra obtained in shoaling water showed a systematic decrease of variance with depth. Normalised spectra did not show a systematic selective attenuation of the variances with frequency.
