5|$|Many reticle {{illumination}} {{and pattern}} options are available. Common light sources used in firearm reflector sights include battery powered lights, fiber optic light collectors, and even tritium capsules. Some sights {{are specifically designed}} to be visible when viewed through night vision devices. <b>The</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sight reticle is often red or amber for visibility against most backgrounds. Some sights use a chevron or triangular pattern instead, to aid precision aiming and range estimation, and still others provide selectable patterns.|$|E
5|$|The {{twentieth century}} saw {{increasingly}} rapid {{advances in the}} scientific study of stars. The photograph became a valuable astronomical tool. Karl Schwarzschild discovered that <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> star and, hence, its temperature, could be determined by comparing the visual magnitude against the photographic magnitude. The development of the photoelectric photometer allowed precise measurements of magnitude at multiple wavelength intervals. In 1921 Albert A. Michelson made the first measurements of a stellar diameter using an interferometer on the Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory.|$|E

5|$|Dishonored {{features}} role-playing game elements, such as {{the ability}} to upgrade powers and to make moral choices with a focus on non-linear consequences. The game is designed to allow the player to complete it without killing any non-player characters (NPC), including boss characters and mission targets. An example of a non-lethal situation given by co-creative designer Harvey Smith involved the player completing a side mission for a character, and in return that character had two of Corvo's targets kidnapped and enslaved. Each mission contains multiple ways to explore and reach targets. Movement through and exploration of levels is designed to support the player character's abilities, rather than specific paths that are aimed at a particular gameplay style, such as hacking or sneaking. Specific elements of missions, such as changes to <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> target's clothing and mask in one mission are randomized, requiring the player to explore the game area to find the target each time the mission is played.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s green became <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} new European {{political}} parties organized around an agenda of environmentalism. Green was chosen for its association with nature, health, and growth. The largest green party in Europe is Alliance '90/The Greens (German: Bündnis 90/Die Grünen) in Germany, which was formed in 1993 from the merger of the German Green Party, founded in West Germany in 1980, and Alliance 90, founded during the Revolution of 1989–1990 in East Germany. In the 2009 federal elections, the party won 11% of the votes and 68 out of 622 seats in the Bundestag.|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} was {{remembered in}} 1858 in a celebration organized by William Cooper Nell, an African American abolitionist {{who saw the}} death of Crispus Attucks {{as an opportunity to}} demonstrate the role of African Americans in the Revolutionary War. Partly because of this activism, artwork commemorating the massacre was produced that changed <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> victim's skin to black (which in Revere's original engraving was white) to emphasize Attucks' claimed martyrdom. In 1888, a monument was erected on the Boston Common to the men killed in the massacre, and the five victims, along with Christopher Seider, were reinterred in a prominent grave in the Granary Burying Ground.|$|E

5|$|Without {{ultrasound}} {{or other}} special tools, determining if a sheep is pregnant is difficult. Ewes only begin to visibly show a pregnancy {{about six weeks}} before giving birth, so shepherds often rely {{on the assumption that}} a ram will impregnate all the ewes in a flock. However, by fitting a ram with a chest harness called a marking harness that holds a special crayon (or raddle, sometimes spelled reddle), ewes that have been mounted are marked with a color. Dye may also be directly applied to the ram's brisket. This measure is not used in flocks where wool is important, since <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> raddle contaminates it.|$|E

This is {{especially}} important when considering fancy colored diamonds, where the slightest shift in color could vastly affect {{the price of the}} diamond. Most fancy colored diamonds are not cut in to round brilliants, because whereas the round brilliant is prized for its ability to reflect white light, the most important characteristic in a fancy colored diamond is its color, not its ability to reflect white light.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{there are}} three major methods to artificially alter <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diamond: {{irradiation}} with high-energy subatomic particles; the application of thin films or coatings; and the combined application of high pressure and high temperature (HPHT). However, there is recent evidence that fracture filling is not only used to improve clarity, but {{that it can be}} used for the sole purpose to change the color into a more desirable color as well.|$|E

This is supported by the fact that grapheme-color synesthetes are able to identify <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> grapheme in their peripheral vision even when they cannot consciously identify the shape of the grapheme.|$|E

25|$|The {{study and}} {{observation}} of plants {{has been of}} high importance to the Maya for centuries. However, the study of medicinal plants {{was limited to the}} priestly class. Plants and herbal remedies were often used in collaboration with other techniques to cure disease. Knowledge of the effects of certain plants on human beings was often used to prescribe an antidote to a particular ailment, but {{it is also important to}} note that medicine men also frequently relied on <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plant or other remedy in certain situations. For instance, yellow plants and fruits were used in curing jaundice; red for problems characterized by blood; and burned feathers of red birds in curing yellow fever.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{sedimentary}} rock is often mostly determined by iron, an element with two major oxides: iron(II) oxide and iron(III) oxide. Iron(II) oxide (FeO) only forms under low oxygen (anoxic) circumstances {{and gives the}} rock a grey or greenish colour. Iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) in a richer iron environment is often found {{in the form of}} the mineral hematite and gives the rock a reddish to brownish colour. In arid continental climates rocks are in direct contact with the atmosphere, and oxidation is an important process, giving the rock a red or orange colour. Thick sequences of red {{sedimentary rock}}s formed in arid climates are called red beds. However, a red colour does not necessarily mean the rock formed in a continental environment or arid climate.|$|E
25|$|A {{chemically}} pure and structurally perfect diamond is perfectly transparent with no hue, or color. However, in reality almost no gem-sized natural diamonds are absolutely perfect. <b>The</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diamond {{may be affected}} by chemical impurities and/or structural defects in the crystal lattice. Depending on the hue and intensity of a diamond's coloration, a diamond's color can either detract from or enhance its value. For example, most white diamonds are discounted in price when more yellow hue is detectable, while intense pink diamonds or blue diamonds (such as the Hope Diamond) can be dramatically more valuable. Of all colored diamonds, red diamonds are the rarest. The Aurora Pyramid of Hope displays a spectacular array of naturally colored diamonds, including red diamonds.|$|E

25|$|Birds {{in roughly}} 30 {{families}} have tomia lined with tight bunches of very short bristles along their entire length. Most {{of these species}} are either insectivores (preferring hard-shelled prey) or snail eaters, and the brush-like projections may help to increase the coefficient of friction between the mandibles, thereby improving the bird's ability to hold hard prey items. Serrations on hummingbird bills, found in 23% of all hummingbird genera, may perform a similar function, allowing the birds to effectively hold insect prey. They may also allow shorter-billed hummingbirds to function as nectar thieves, as they can more effectively hold and cut through long or waxy flower corollas. In some cases, <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bird's tomia can help to distinguish between similar species. The snow goose, for example, has a reddish-pink bill with black tomia, while the whole beak of the similar Ross's goose is pinkish-red, without darker tomia.|$|E
