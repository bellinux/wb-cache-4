The final version of record is available at: [URL] podcast of Aymeric Goyer discussing his work with Andrew Hanson and colleagues on the function of a group of Nudix enzymes from fungi and plants, showing that they hydrolyse oxidized forms of the enzyme cofactor thiamin diphosphate is available from the publisher at: [URL] specifying the <b>thiamin</b> <b>monophosphate</b> phosphatase and adenylated thiazole diphosphatase steps in fungal and plant thiamin biosynthesis remain unknown, as do genes for thiamin diphosphate (ThDP) hydrolysis in thiamin metabolism. A distinctive Nudix domain fused to thiamin diphosphokinase (Tnr 3) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe was evaluated as a candidate for these functions. Comparative genomic analysis predicted a role in thiamin metabolism, not biosynthesis, because freestanding homologues of this Nudix domain occur not only in fungi and plants, but also in proteobacteria (whose thiamin biosynthesis pathway has no adenylated thiazole or <b>thiamin</b> <b>monophosphate</b> hydrolysis steps) and animals (which do not make thiamin). Supporting this prediction, recombinant Tnr 3 and its Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis, and maize Nudix homologues lacked <b>thiamin</b> <b>monophosphate</b> phosphatase activity but were active against ThDP, and up to 60 -fold more active against diphosphates of the toxic thiamin degradation products oxy- and oxothiamin. Deleting the S. cerevisiae Nudix gene (YJR 142 W) lowered oxythiamin resistance, overexpressing it raised resistance, and expressing its plant or bacterial counterparts restored resistance to the YJR 142 W deletant. By hydrolysing the diphosphates of damaged forms of thiamin, the Tnr 3 Nudix domain and its homologues can pre-empt the misincorporation of these damaged forms into ThDP-dependent enzymes, and the resulting toxicity...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to compare surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) methods for the analysis of N(epsilon) -(carboxymethyplysine (CML) in glucose bovine serum albumin (BSA) model systems and to investigate the possible inhibitory effect of selected compounds (a-tocopherol, ferulic acid, rutin, thiamin, <b>thiamin</b> <b>monophosphate,</b> and thiamin pyrophosphate) on CML formation. The reported levels of CML detected were dependent upon the method of analysis employed. The highest reported concentrations were obtained with the SPA biosensor, whereas the lowest were found by ELISA. However, a high correlation was observed between these two immunochemical procedures. CML concentrations were dependent upon the type and concentration of the candidate CML inhibitor. All inhibitory compounds investigated, with the exception of a-tocopherol, decreased the level of CML formation in the glucose BSA system...|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} {{the activity of the}} thiamin phosphate pyrophosphorylase in Arabidopsis thaliana wild type and in a mutant (th- 1) which requires exogenous thiamin for growth. Mutant and wild-type plants grown in 1 × 10 − 7 molar thiamin were used for the examination of the production of thiamin and <b>thiamin</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (TMP) using 4 -methyl- 5 -hydroxyethylthiazole phosphate and 2 -methyl- 4 -amino- 5 -hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate as substrates. While the wild-type strain formed both thiamin and TMP, the th- 1 mutant did not. When TMP was added to the extracts, the th- 1 mutant, as well as wild type, produced thiamin. Accordingly, it was concluded that the th- 1 mutant was defective in the activity of TMP pyrophosphorylase. Some of the characteristics of the enzyme from the wild-type plant were examined. The optimum temperature for the reaction is 45 °C, and the Km values for the substrates are 2. 7 × 10 − 6 molar for 4 -methyl- 5 -hydroxyethylthiazole phosphate and 1. 8 × 10 − 6 molar for 2 -methyl- 4 -amino- 5 -hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate...|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} {{adverse effects}} on health of diet-derived advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) and advanced lipoxidation endproducts (ALEs) is of current interest. This study had the objective of determining {{the effects of the}} addition of AGE/ALE inhibitors and different types of sugar and cooking oil on Nε-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) and Nε-(carboxyethyl) lysine (CEL) formation in model foods (sponge cakes). The cake baked using glucose produced the highest level of CML (2. 07 ± 0. 24 mmol/mol lysine), whereas the cake baked using fructose produced the highest concentration of CEL (25. 1 ± 0. 15 mmol/mol lysine). There {{were no significant differences between}} CML concentrations formed in the cakes prepared using different types of cooking oil, but significant differences (P < 0. 001) were observed between the cakes prepared using different proportions of cooking oil. The cakes containing oil generated greater concentrations of CML than sucrose. α-Tocopherol and rutin did not inhibit CML and CEL formation. In contrast, ferulic acid and thiamin, <b>thiamin</b> <b>monophosphate,</b> and thiamin pyrophosphate reduced CML and CEL formation...|$|E

40|$|Vitamin B 1, which {{consists}} of the vitamers thiamin and its phosphorylated derivatives, is an essential micronutrient for all living organisms because it is required as a metabolic cofactor in several enzymatic reactions. Genetic diversity of vitamin B 1 biosynthesis and accumulation has not been investigated in major crop species other than rice and potato. We analyzed cassava germplasm for accumulation of B 1 vitamers. Vitamin B 1 content in leaves and roots of 41 cassava accessions showed significant variation between accessions. HPLC analyses of B 1 vitamers revealed distinct profiles in cassava leaves and storage roots, with nearly equal relative levels of thiamin pyrophosphate and <b>thiamin</b> <b>monophosphate</b> in leaves, but mostly thiamin pyrophosphate in storage roots. Unusually, the cassava genome has two genes encoding the 4 -amino- 2 -methyl- 5 -hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate synthase, THIC (MeTHIC 1 and MeTHIC 2), both of which carry a riboswitch in the 3 '-UTR, {{as well as the}} adenylated thiazole synthase, THI 1 (MeTHI 1 a and MeTHI 1 b). The THIC and THI 1 genes are expressed at very low levels in storage roots compared with the accumulation of vitamin B 1, indicating only limited biosynthesis de novo therein. In leaves, vitamin B 1 content is negatively correlated with THIC and THI 1 expression levels, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation of THIC by the riboswitch present in the 3 '-UTR of the THIC mRNA and regulation of THI 1 by promoter activity or alternative post-transcriptional mechanisms.

40|$|Thiamin (vitamin B 1) {{is made by}} {{plants and}} {{microorganisms}} but is an essential micronutrient in the human diet. All organisms require it as a cofactor in its form as thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) for the activity of key enzymes of central metabolism. In humans, deficiency is widespread particularly in populations where polished rice is {{a major component of}} the diet. Considerable progress has been made on the elucidation of the biosynthesis pathway within the last few years enabling concrete strategies for biofortification purposes to be devised, with a particular focus here on genetic engineering. Furthermore, the vitamin has been shown {{to play a role in}} both abiotic and biotic stress responses. The precursors for de novo biosynthesis of thiamin differ between microorganisms and plants. Bacteria use intermediates derived from purine and isoprenoid biosynthesis, whereas the pathway in yeast involves the use of compounds from the vitamin B 3 and B 6 groups. Plants on the other hand use a combination of the bacterial and yeast pathways and there is subcellular partitioning of the biosynthesis steps. Specifically, thiamin biosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast of plants through the separate formation of the pyrimidine and thiazole moieties, which are then coupled to form <b>thiamin</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (TMP). Phosphorylation of thiamin to form TPP occurs in the cytosol. Therefore, thiamin (or TMP) must be exported from the chloroplast to the cytosol for the latter step to be executed. The regulation of biosynthesis is mediated through riboswitches, where binding of the product TPP to the pre-mRNA of a biosynthetic gene modulates expression. Here we examine and hypothesize on genetic engineering approaches attempting to increase the thiamin content employing knowledge gained with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We will discuss the regulatory steps that need to be taken into consideration and can be used a prerequisite for devising such strategies in crop plants...|$|E
40|$|The kinetic {{behavior}} of pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) containing bound endogenous thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) {{was affected by}} exogenous TPP. In the absence of exogenous TPP, a lag phase of the PDC reaction was observed. TPP added to the PDC reaction medium containing Mg 2 � led to a disappearance of the lag phase, inducing strong reduction of the Km value for pyruvate (from 76. 7 to 19. 0 �M) but a more moderate decrease of Km for CoA (from 12. 2 to 4. 3 �M) and Km for NAD � (from 70. 2 to 33. 6 �M), with no considerable change in the maximum reaction rate. Likewise, <b>thiamin</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (TMP) decreased the Km value of PDC for pyruvate, but {{to a lesser extent}} (from 76. 7 to 57. 9 �M) than TPP. At the unsaturating level of pyruvate, the A 50 values for TPP and TMP were 0. 2 �M and 0. 3 mM, respectively. This could mean that the effect of TPP on PDC was more specific. In addition, exogenous TPP changed the UV spectrum and lowered the fluorescence emission of the PDC containing bound endogenous TPP in its active sites. The data obtained suggest that TPP plays, in addition to its catalytic function, the important role of positive regulatory effector of pig heart PDC. © 1999 Academic Press The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is a multicomponent enzyme system that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate, CoA and NAD � into acetyl-CoA, NADH and CO 2 [1]. The structural core of mammalian PDC is composed of 60 identical subunits of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E 2) arranged in a pentagonal dodecahedron [2, 3]. Associated with E 2 are approximately 6 molecules of protein X, 30 heterotetramers of pyruvate dehydrogenase (E 1) and 6 homodimers of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E 3). In addition each molecule of PDC tightly binds 1 – 3 heterodimers of E 1 -kinase and reversibly one heterodimer of E 1 - phosphatase [2 – 4]. For the initial reaction step of th...|$|E
40|$|Macromolecular {{crystallography}} {{allows for}} the structures of biologically interesting molecules to be determined to atomic resolutions. The enzymes involved in metabolic pathways often catalyze interesting and novel chemical reactions, and understanding the structure of these enzymes can offer insight into the function and mechanism of the enzyme. In the thiamin biosynthetic pathway, the two moieties of thiamin are biosynthesized separately and then stitched together by thiamin phosphate synthase. Recent work has shown {{that one of the}} heterocyclic moieties is carboxylated; the crystal structure and kinetic characterization of Bacillus subtilis thiamin phosphate synthase with carboxylated thiazole phosphate and the pyrimidine moiety demonstrate the activity of this enzyme with this substrate. Additionally, thiamin phosphate synthase is an ideal drug target in some pathogens as thiamin is an essential cofactor and humans do not have this enzyme. The crystal structure of thiamin phosphate synthase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was determined and used for identifying potential drug compounds. The final step in thiamin biosynthesis is the phosphorylation of thiamin phosphate to produce the biologically active thiamin pyrophosphate and the crystal structure of Aquifex aeolicus <b>thiamin</b> <b>monophosphate</b> kinase has shown that this reaction proceeds via an in-line phosphate transfer. While much work has been devoted {{to the study of the}} biosynthesis of cofactors, the degradation pathways can also contain interesting chemistry. The degradation of PLP occurs over seven steps in Mesorhizobium loti MAFF 303099 and the final three steps have been structurally characterized. 2 -Methryl- 3 hydroxypyridine- 4, 5 -dicarboxylate decarboxylase shows significant similarity to class II aldolases and uses a retro-Aldol type reaction to catalyze its decarboxylation reaction. The following enzyme, 2 -methyl- 3 -hydroxypyridine- 5 -carboxylic acid oxygenase, catalyzes an oxidative ring opening and incorporates two atoms of oxygen to produce E- 2 -(acetamidomethylene) succinate. The structure of this enzyme demonstrates its similarity to flavin monooxygenases and offers clues to catalytically important residues. The final enzyme, E- 2 -(acetamidomethylene) succinate hydrolase, is an alpha/beta hydrolase and catalyzes the production of succinic semialdehyde, ammonia, acetate, and carbon dioxide using a modified catalytic triad consisting of a serine, histidine, and aspartic acid...|$|E
40|$|Our {{laboratory}} {{has previously}} invented and characterized a technique for studying ligand-receptor interactions on supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) without fluorescently labeled analytes. This technique utilizes a pH-sensitive dye labeled phospholipid, ortho-rhodamine B conjugated POPE (1 -hexadecanoyl- 2 -(9 Z-octa-decenoyl) -sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoethanolamine), as a membrane imbedded reporter molecule to monitor ligand-receptor interactions on SLBs {{by measuring the}} fluorescence intensity change. Also, this technique has been demonstrated to operate as either a ?turn-on? or a ?turn-off? sensor depending on the analytes to be detected. Based on these preliminary studies, {{it is necessary to}} give further development and application for this new technique. Firstly, as a potential application of this sensing technique, we utilized this sensing platform to detect the interactions between tetracaine, a positively charged small molecule used as a local anesthetic drug, and planar supported lipid bilayers (SLBs). Studies with membranes composed of POPC (1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine) yielded an equilibrium dissociation constant value of Kd = 180 ? 47 ?m for this small molecule-membrane interaction. And the influences of cholesterol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and three negatively charged lipids on the interaction between tetracaine and the bilayers have been studied. Secondly, in order to fully develop the power of this local pH modulation technique, it has been extended to a homogeneous platform from an SLB based heterogeneous platform. Specifically, a pH sensitive dye, 5 -(and- 6) -carboxyfluorescein, was conjugated to free lysine residues on the surfaces of designated capture proteins. The fluorescein intensity was found to change upon target molecule binding. The assay was used to follow the binding of immunoglobulin G (IgG) to streptavidin, <b>thiamin</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (ThMP) to thiamin binding protein A (TbpA), and Ca^(2 +) to calmodulin (CaM). Finally, as an instrumental development for this sensing platform, an inexpensive fluorescence detector has been built as a cheap substitute for the epi-fluorescence microscope. This device is composed of a compact camera, a schott glass color filter, and a green (532 nm) laser pointer. This device has been tested to be able to obtain fluorescence images with decent signal to noise ratio. And this device has been demonstrated in measuring tetracaine-POPC SLB interaction using local pH modulation method...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report the cloning and {{sequence}} analysis of four genes, located on plasmid pb, which {{are involved in}} the synthesis of thiamin in Rhizobium etli (thiC, thiO, thiG, and thiE). Two precursors, 4 -methyl- 5 -(beta-hydroxyethyl) thiazole monophosphate and 4 -amino- 5 -hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate, are coupled to form <b>thiamin</b> <b>monophosphate,</b> which is then phosphorylated to make thiamin pyrophosphate. The first open reading frame (ORF) product, of 610 residues, has significant homology (69 % identity) with the product of thiC from Escherichia coli, which is involved in the synthesis of hydroxymethylpyrimidine. The second ORF product, of 327 residues, {{is the product of a}} novel gene denoted thiO. A protein motif involved in flavin adenine dinucleotide binding was found in the amino-terminal part of ThiO; also, residues involved in the catalytic site of D-amino acid oxidases are conserved in ThiO, suggesting that it catalyzes the oxidative deamination of some intermediate of thiamin biosynthesis. The third ORF product, of 323 residues, has significant homology (38 % identity) with ThiG from E. coli, which is involved in the synthesis of the thiazole. The fourth ORF product, of 204 residues, has significant homology (47 % identity) with the product of thiE from E. coli, which is involved in the condensation of hydroxymethylpyrimidine and thiazole. Strain CFN 037 is an R. etli mutant induced by a single Tn 5 mob insertion in the promoter region of the thiCOGE gene cluster. The Tn 5 mob insertion in CFN 037 occurred within a 39 -bp region which is highly conserved in all of the thiC promoters analyzed and promotes constitutive expression of thiC. Primer extension analysis showed that thiC transcription in strain CFN 037 originates within the Tn 5 element. Analysis of c-type protein content and expression of the fixNOQP operon, which codes for the symbiotic terminal oxidase cbb 3, revealed that CFN 037 produces the cbb 3 terminal oxidase. These data show a direct relationship between expression of thiC and production of the cbb 3 terminal oxidase. This is consistent with the proposition that a purine-related metabolite, 5 -aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide ribonucleotide, is a negative effector of the production of the symbiotic terminal oxidase cbb 3 in R. etli...|$|E
