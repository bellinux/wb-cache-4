5|$|Implementation of {{the plan}} will reduce waste and consumerism. In fact, {{according}} <b>to</b> <b>official</b> data, the higher income strata {{of the population has}} enjoyed the same subsidies as the poor until now. On the other side, subsidies reduction will reduce air pollution by reducing car traffic in Tehran. Finally, the subsidy plan will increase social justice through targeted social assistance. According <b>to</b> <b>official</b> data, the richest decile of households benefits 12 times more from gasoline subsidies than the poorest decile. Overall, implementation {{of the plan}} will increase productivity, efficiency, competitiveness of Iran's economy, economic growth, oil exports and per capita income (all other things being equal).|$|E

According to Ashley Jackson's work The British Empire and the Second World War, the Rhodesian Air Training Group instructed 8,235 Allied pilots, navigators, gunners, ground crew and others—about 5% of overall EATS output.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crisis}} eased, New Jersey was {{released}} {{to continue her}} interrupted voyage. She anchored at Long Beach 5 May 1969, her first visit to her home port in eight months. Through the summer months, New Jerseys crew toiled to make her ready for another deployment, and deficiencies discovered on the gun line were remedied. According <b>to</b> <b>official</b> reports, though, reasons of economy were to dictate otherwise: on 22 August 1969 the United States Secretary of Defense released {{a list of names}} of ships to be inactivated; {{at the top of the}} list was New Jersey. Five days later, Captain Snyder was relieved of command by Captain Robert C. Peniston.|$|E

5|$|At the Council of Hieria in 754, Constantine V had {{declared}} the adoration of icons to be a heresy, and had thereby elevated iconoclasm <b>to</b> <b>official</b> imperial policy. No persecution of iconophiles was launched at first, but iconophile resistance grew, until from 765 on, Constantine began persecuting iconophiles, and especially monks. The {{discovery of a}} wide-ranging iconophile plot against him involving {{some of the highest}} civil and military officials of the state in 766 provoked an extreme reaction. Patriarch Constantine II and other officials were deposed, jailed, publicly humiliated, and finally executed, replaced by new, uncompromisingly iconoclast officials. In addition, the veneration of sacred relics and prayers to the saints and the Virgin Mary were condemned.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, more recent work has {{suggested}} that the regular army of the 2nd century was considerably larger than the c. 300,000 traditionally assumed. This is because the 2nd-century auxilia were not just equal in numbers to the legions as in the early 1st century, but some 50% larger. The army of the Principate probably reached a peak of nearly 450,000 (excluding fleets and foederati) {{at the end of the}} 2nd century. Furthermore, the evidence is that the actual strength of 2nd-century units was typically much closer <b>to</b> <b>official</b> (c. 85%) than 4th century units.|$|E

These gains were achieved through the persistent organizing and advocacy by Indigenous communities {{to draw attention to the}} residential school system's legacy of abuse, including their participation in hearings of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.|$|E

5|$|In 2001 {{there were}} about 1,700 hospitals, of which about 40% were government-run and 60% private. Cardiovascular {{diseases}} {{account for more than}} 25% of all deaths.
