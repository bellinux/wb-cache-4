At first they were unable <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> to happen, but later noticed that the container was being removed to replace the object within. During one such event they {{took the opportunity to}} roll up a small ball of metal foil and drop it into the circular ring cut into the surface of the table that held the globe. This introduced a small gap under one edge, which they could blow into to cause the paper to move.|$|E
25|$|He {{wanted to}} be an artist or illustrator, but he was often {{discouraged}} by societal norms of Japan which favored finding safe, well-paying jobs. He was discouraged because his uncle was an artist who suffered from financial difficulties. Another reason was his father's death which left his family more financially tight. He eventually started writing short stories and began to send them to Japanese magazines but was not able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> published. He cites that his stories were often 400 pages long while most magazines wanted their short stories to be around 100 pages. Eventually, he shifted his focus to making films with his friend who had an 8mm camera.|$|E

25|$|Early in 1913, Deakin {{resigned}} as Leader of the Opposition. Forrest and Joseph Cook contested the leadership, with Cook winning {{by a single}} vote. Forrest was very disappointed, especially since Deakin, whom he considered a friend, had voted against him. Five months later, in the May 1913 federal election, the Liberal Party returned to power, with Cook as Prime Minister. Forrest was appointed treasurer for the third time. However, the government's majority of just one seat in the House of Representatives, along with Labor's large majority in the Senate, made it difficult <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> done. In June 1914, Cook asked the Governor-General for a double dissolution, and Australia {{was sent back to}} the polls. Forrest retained his seat, but the Liberal Party was soundly defeated and Forrest was again relegated to the crossbenches.|$|E
25|$|March {{started with}} the newly crowned League Cup winners visiting St Andrew's. It {{was not to be}} Tottenham's day, however, as the Blues emphatically won 4–1. A Forssell hat-trick and a free kick from Larsson saw the Blues lead 4–0 before a late Jermaine Jenas goal in second half injury time saw Maik Taylor fail to get his clean sheet. Next up for the Blues was a tricky away tie to another team going well in a {{domestic}} cup. Portsmouth, who had just qualified for the semi-final of the FA Cup, went into an early two-goal lead thanks to Jermain Defoe, before goals from Fabrice Muamba and another Larsson free kick saw Blues complete a first-half comeback. Second-half goals from Hermann Hreiðarsson and Nwankwo Kanu saw the Blues fail <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> from the south coast.|$|E
25|$|The Eagles offense {{took the}} field for the first time, with the ball spotted at their own 29-yard line. After an {{incomplete}} pass, QB Michael Vick threw a pass intended for WR DeSean Jackson, but it was picked off by CB Corey Webster who returned it to the Philadelphia 42-yard line. The Giants were unable to capitalize on the turnover, as LB Moise Fokou sacked QB Eli Manning putting them out of field goal range and forcing them to punt. After the Eagles failed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> going on the ensuing drive, the Giants put together a 71-yard scoring drive that ended with Manning finding WR Mario Manningham for a 35-yard touchdown pass to put the Giants on the board, leading 7–0. Near the end of the quarter S Quintin Mikell picked off Manning's pass to WR Derek Hagan and ran it back to the Giants 45-yard line. The final play of the first quarter resulted in a run by Vick for 11 yards and a personal foul called on T Jonathan Goff which moved the ball to the Giants' 19-yard line.|$|E

25|$|Bristol {{races are}} often {{the scene of the}} highest number of yellow-flag caution laps in the NASCAR season; with so many cars in such a small space, contact is almost inevitable. Until the Beneficiary Rule was instituted in 2004 (the rule was instituted after the races at Bristol in 2003), the short lap length and the {{unpredictable}} nature of the racing meant that {{this was one of the}} few remaining NASCAR tracks at which it was feasible for a driver to come back to win a race from several laps down; at most modern tracks, especially superspeedways, that was almost impossible. The short lap length also cuts the other way; any unscheduled pit stop for reasons such as a cut tire will result in the driver going two or more laps down as it is almost impossible <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> done to a car during the time taken to complete one circuit, especially under green-flag conditions (approximately 15seconds). Thus, the disadvantage of losing laps means the chances of earning a free pass under the Beneficiary Rule is harder, since a driver losing two laps under a green-flag pit stop would have to race their way past the leader before the caution waved to regain one of their laps back, unless there are no cars one lap behind.|$|E
500|$|Northern {{and central}} Sudan had been {{nominally}} under Egyptian suzerainty since an Ottoman force had conquered and occupied {{the region in}} 1821. The primary motive was not territorial conquest but to secure a source of slaves {{to serve in the}} Egyptian army. The slaves, paid in lieu of taxes, were brought from the formerly inaccessible regions of south Sudan. When the British explorer Samuel Baker visited Khartoum in 1862, he found that everyone in the town was involved in the slave trade, including the Governor-General. The Egyptian and Nubian garrison lived on the land like an army of occupation. Bribery was the only way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> done. Torture and floggings were routine in the prisons. Baker said of Khartoum [...] "a more miserable and unhealthy place can hardly be imagined". He described the Governor General Musa Pasha as combining [...] "the worst of Oriental failings with the brutality of a wild animal".|$|E

Danny Higginbotham put Sunderland into the lead shortly after half time, but James Milner drew Newcastle level on the 68th minute after his cross beat goalkeeper Craig Gordon into the far post.

Sunderland ended the month on a low as they were beaten 7–1 away to Everton on 24 November. Dwight Yorke scored Sunderland's only goal just before half time.

She visualized the character Twilight Sparkle whenever she [...] "found herself in a bad-mood rut". The story misidentified Twilight Sparkle as Fluttershy on initial publication and the paper issued a correction, which some journalists have jokingly considered as [...] "the best New York Times correction ever", though others saw it {{as a sign of the}} journalistic integrity of the Times. Harmon was contacted by fans about the mistake, and said, [...] "I hate <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> wrong, but I confess to some enjoyment in finding the right way to phrase this one." [...] In 2015, the New York Times reported that Dylann Roof, the suspect in the Charleston church shooting, was a fan of My Little Pony, but later corrected itself after recognizing it had been duped in a experiment run by a blogger, who had faked the claim but made it as credible as possible as to test how much fact checking major news sources were doing on a high-interest topic.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Hideaki Sorachi was an up-and-coming manga {{artist who}} had already created two one-shots for the Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine. Although he was {{preparing}} to write his first serialized series, his editor suggested he create a manga series based on the Shinsengumi, mostly inspired by an upcoming TV-drama about the 1860s troupe as depicted by idol actors. Sorachi attempted to create this series since he admitted to liking the Shinsengumi, but ultimately failed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> off the ground. Instead of abandoning the idea completely, he remained focused on the historical Japanese era but began to create his own story, adding in elements of science fiction and fictionalizing many of the figures from the era to create a story more to his own liking. The original title of the series {{was meant to be}} , but it did not have any impact on Sorachi. After great debate, he decided to go with the name Gin Tama after discussing it with his family, deciding on a name that sounded close to the edge without being completely off it. Although Sorachi considered the one-shot [...] "Samuraider" [...] to be very poor, the setting of such one-shot served as the base for Gin Tama such as the addition of alien characters. Sorachi liked the Bakumatsu and Sengoku periods due to how both were eras of change and thus presented the positive and negative points of humanity. The series was then set in an alternate Bakumatsu to give a bigger significance to the characters' bushido as in that time samurais were at the low point of their lives.|$|E
