5000|$|The sample <b>Taylor</b> <b>diagram</b> {{shown in}} Figure 1 {{provides}} {{a summary of}} the relative skill with which several global climate models simulate the spatial pattern of annual mean precipitation. Eight models, each represented by a different letter on the diagram, are compared, and the distance between each model and the point labeled “observed” is a measure of how realistically each model reproduces observations. For each model, three statistics are plotted: the Pearson correlation coefficient (gauging similarity in pattern between the simulated and observed fields) is related to the azimuthal angle (blue contours); the centered RMS error in the simulated field is proportional to the distance from the point on the x-axis identified as “observed” (green contours); and the standard deviation of the simulated pattern is proportional to the radial distance from the origin (black contours). It is evident from this diagram, for example, that for Model F the correlation coefficient is about 0.65, the RMS error is about 2.6 mm/day and the standard deviation is about 3.3 mm/day. Model F’s standard deviation is clearly greater than the standard deviation of the observed field (indicated by the dashed contour at radial distance 2.9 mm/day).|$|E

40|$|Vector quantities, e. g., vector winds, play an {{extremely}} important role in climate systems. The energy and water exchanges between different regions are strongly dominated by wind, which in turn shapes the regional climate. Thus, how well climate models can simulate vector fields directly affects model performance in reproducing {{the nature of a}} regional climate. This paper devises a new diagram, termed the vector field evaluation (VFE) diagram, which is a generalized <b>Taylor</b> <b>diagram</b> and able to provide a concise evaluation of model performance in simulating vector fields. The diagram can measure how well two vector fields match each other in terms of three statistical variables, i. e., the vector similarity coefficient, root mean square length (RMSL), and root mean square vector difference (RMSVD). Similar to the <b>Taylor</b> <b>diagram,</b> the VFE diagram is especially useful for evaluating climate models. The pattern similarity of two vector fields is measured by a vector similarity coefficient (VSC) that is defined by the arithmetic mean of the inner product of normalized vector pairs. Examples are provided, showing that VSC can identify how close one vector field resembles another. Note that VSC can only describe the pattern similarity, and it does not reflect the systematic difference in the mean vector length between two vector fields. To measure the vector length, RMSL is included in the diagram. The third variable, RMSVD, is used to identify the magnitude of the overall difference between two vector fields. Examples show that the VFE diagram can clearly illustrate {{the extent to which the}} overall RMSVD is attributed to the systematic difference in RMSL and how much is due to the poor pattern similarity...|$|E

Seasonal maxima of daily mean temperature and precipitation are analyzed using the generalized extreme value method. RCMs show systematic bias patterns in both seasonal means and extremes. A cold bias is located along the coast, whereas a warm bias occurs in northern China. Overall, wet bias occurs in East Asia, but with a substantial dry bias centered in South Korea. This dry bias appears {{to be related to the}} colder ocean surface around South Korea, positioning the monsoonal front further south compared to observations. <b>Taylor</b> <b>diagram</b> analyses reveal that the models simulate temperature means more accurately compared to extremes because of the higher spatial correlation, whereas precipitation extremes are simulated better than their means because of the higher spatial variability. The latter implies that extreme rainfall events can be captured more accurately by RCMs compared to the driving GCM despite poorer simulation of mean rainfall. Inter-RCM analysis indicates a close relationship between the means and extremes in terms of model skills, but it does not show a clear relationship between temperature and precipitation. Sub-regional analysis largely supports the mean&# 8211;extreme skill relationship.

We evaluate data from two contrasting locations in the first detailed evaluation of the IMOS HF radar surface velocities. HF radar measurements are generally robust but demand quality-control procedures to eliminate obvious errors and outliers that appear temporarily or systematically in the data. A number of different quality control procedures and filters are applied and assessed including Taylor diagrams, Hampel and Savitzky-Golay filters. In addition the need for and effect of averaging are discussed. The radar measurements of surface current agreed better with the near-surface drifter currents than with the subsurface ADCP currents. Nonetheless the ADCP comparisons are consistent with those previously reported in other regions. The value of the <b>Taylor</b> <b>Diagram</b> for comparing different surface current data sets and processing approaches is demonstrated. Noise levels in the radar current spectra are used to estimate the error in the measurements and in some cases, these errors were found to approach the precision of the radar estimates. Our results give guidance on the most useful temporal sampling resolution. In particular we show that, at these sites and these operating frequencies, using 10 -minute sampling without further averaging does not provide additional information because the higher frequencies are dominated by noise. Averaging the radials over 30 -minutes may be sufficient for many applications. ...|$|E

The skill of each global climate model over Asia was tested separately in detail {{for the period}} of 21 years (1983 – 2003), and simulated Asian summer monsoon rainfall (ASMR) has been verified using various statistical measures for Indian and East Asian land masses separately. The analysis found a large variation in spatial ASMR simulated with uncoupled model compared to coupled models (like Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia, National Centers for Environmental Prediction and Japan Meteorological Agency). The simulated ASMR in coupled model was closer to Climate Prediction Centre Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) compared to uncoupled models although the amount of ASMR was underestimated in both models. Analysis also found a high spread in simulated ASMR among the ensemble members (suggesting that the model’s performance is highly dependent on its initial conditions). The correlation analysis between sea surface temperature (SST) and ASMR shows that that the coupled models are strongly associated with ASMR compared to the uncoupled models (suggesting that air-sea interaction is well cared in coupled models). The analysis of rainfall using various statistical measures suggests that the multi-model ensemble (MME) performed better compared to individual model and also separate study indicate that Indian and East Asian land masses are more useful compared to Asia monsoon rainfall as a whole.

The main feature of the mission is that the glider measurements are almost synchronous with the altimeter pass. The HF radar system operated by the Balearic Islands Coastal Observing and Forecasting System (SOCIB) constitutes a complementary tool to describe the circulation in the study area. The work is focused on the data processing step (interpolation, filtering, corrections) applied to the measurements and on the comparison of the geostrophic velocity across the satellite track. The absolute dynamic topography, computed by adding filtered 1 Hz and 40 Hz along-track sea-level anomalies Mediterranean Sea Mean Dynamic Topography, and the dynamic height, computed from glider temperature and salinity, both exhibited a signal characterized by weak gradients and amplitudes (2 cm), close to the expected accuracy of the AltiKa instrument. The corresponding geostrophic velocities and the HF radar velocities projected on the SARAL/AltiKa track all depicted a northwestward coastal current with a maximal velocity larger than 20 cm/s. The lack of synopticity due to the time interval between the satellite pass (August 1, 2013, 18 : 26 : 12 UTC) {{and the end of the}} glider transect (August 5, 2013, 04 : 17 : 22 UTC) resulted in a spatial shift between the glider and the altimeter along-track signal, around 5 km. The time evolution of the HF radar currents during the mission duration confirmed the plausibility of such a shift. After the application of a 5 km lag to the glider dynamic height, the correlation and RMS difference between the different platforms were computed. The agreement between the altimetry, glider and HF radar cross-track velocities was synthesized in a <b>Taylor</b> <b>diagram</b> that evidenced the lowest root mean square difference (9. 72 cm/s) and the highest correlation (0. 64) between the velocities obtained from the glider dynamic height and those from the filtered 40 Hz sea-level anomalies.

Long-term measurement data from three HELCOM monitoring stations representing western, central and eastern parts of the Gulf were used. In this study we focus on <b>Taylor</b> <b>diagram</b> that provides quick summary of the degree of patterns correspondence and allows seeing how well model simulates natural pattern. For statistical analysis the surface temperature and salinity have been given the values at a depth of 5 m, and the bottom salinity and temperature are the corresponding values at the lowest depth (about 60 m) at which measurements were carried out. The validation results were grouped similarly for both models. Modeled surface temperature showed good agreement with observed data in all three stations. Root mean square error (RMSE) was between 0. 2 and 0. 4, correlation coefficients between 0. 94 and 0. 98 and normalized standard deviations between 0. 9 and 1. 1 for the both models. Thus, seasonal cycles in the upper layer were reproduced well. Bottom temperatures and surface and bottom salinities were reproduced with lower quality. Bottom temperatures were better reproduced in the western and central Gulf than in the eastern Gulf. Surface salinity was simulated with the same quality in all stations by GETM, while MOM reproduced salinity better in the central Gulf compared to the eastern and western part.
