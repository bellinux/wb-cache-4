25|$|Former US President Bill Clinton, {{giving a}} speech at a Freedom House breakfast, said: I'm honored <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>with</b> all of you and to be here at Freedom House. For more than 50 years, Freedom House has been a voice for {{tolerance}} for human dignity. People {{all over the world}} are better off because of your work. And I'm very grateful that Freedom House has rallied this diverse and dynamic group. It's not every day that the Carnegie Endowment, the Progressive Policy Institute, The Heritage Foundation, and the American Foreign Policy Council share the same masthead.|$|E

Every once and awhile you need to get out on the streets and get a little bloody when necessary". Following criticism, Capuano expressed regret for his [...] "choice of words." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson has had {{multiple}} injuries. In 2008, after the Olympics, she had surgery to fix her ankle. In 2009, {{she had two}} stress fractures in her back. In December 2010, she had an Achilles injury. [...] She sustained the injury playing in Australia. Between January 2011 and February 2012, she had surgeries to assist with Achilles and hip injuries. She had surgery on her left hip acetabular labrum in June 2011 in Vail, Colorado at the Richard Steadman Clinic. [...] She said of the surgery: [...] "This is a really, really tough decision, but after talking with my doctors and my family, we felt that immediate surgery is {{the best course of}} action. With something painful like this hip injury, I want to be especially proactive. I plan to stay in Seattle <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>with</b> my team and try my best to be back on the court as soon as possible. My goal is to be at full strength {{by the end of the}} season." [...] She did rehab twice a day in an attempt to speed recovery. Afterwards, Jackson injured her right knee, requiring surgery in 2012. Another knee injury while playing in China in 2014 degraded into arthritis and required many surgical intervention in the following years, including a hospitalization in January 2016 once the operated knee joint got infected. All the consequences of this knee problem lead to Jackson's retirement in March. Jackson has expressed interest in undergoing a knee reconstruction, as [...] "I don't want to walk with a limp for the rest of my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Richards' {{keynote address}} to the 1988 Democratic National Convention {{put her in the}} {{national}} spotlight. The speech was highly critical of the Reagan Administration and then-Vice President George H. W. Bush. Her address was notable for including several humorous remarks displaying her down-home Texas charm such as: [...] "I'm delighted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>with</b> you this evening, because after listening to George Bush all these years, I figured you needed to know what a real Texas accent sounds like", [...] "Poor George, he can't help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth", [...] "…two women in 160 years is about par for the course. But if you give us a chance, we can perform. After all, Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels." [...] and [...] "When we pay billions for planes that won't fly, billions for tanks that won't fire, and billions for systems that won't work, that old dog won't hunt. And you don't have to be from Waco to know that when the Pentagon makes crooks rich and doesn't make America strong, that it's a bum deal." [...] Richards' convention address has been cited by rhetorical experts as a historically significant speech.|$|E
