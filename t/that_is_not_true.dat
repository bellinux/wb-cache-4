25|$|In Canada and Greenland, {{the term}} Eskimo {{has largely been}} supplanted by the term Inuit. While Inuit can be {{accurately}} applied {{to all of the}} Eskimo peoples in Canada and Greenland, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> in Alaska and Siberia. In Alaska the term Eskimo is commonly used, because it includes both Yupik and Iñupiat. Inuit is not accepted as a collective term and it is not used specifically for Iñupiat (although they are related to the Canadian Inuit peoples).|$|E
25|$|DES gained notoriety when it {{was shown}} to cause a rare vaginal tumor in girls and young {{women who had been}} exposed to this drug in utero. In 1971, the New England Journal of Medicine {{published}} a report showing that seven of eight girls and young women (ages 14 to 22) who had been diagnosed with vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma had been exposed prenatally to DES. Subsequent studies have shown an approximate 40-fold increased risk of vaginal/cervical clear cell adenocarcinoma in women exposed in utero to DES. As a consequence of this evidence, DES is considered an established human carcinogen. DES {{was one of the first}} transplacental carcinogens discovered in humans, meaning a toxin could cross the placenta and harm the fetus. It had originally been believed that the placenta protected the developing fetus but it is now known <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true.</b> Daughters exposed to DES in utero may also have an increased risk of moderate to severe cervical squamous cell dysplasia and an increased risk of breast cancer.|$|E

25|$|The main {{distinction}} between the La Lagunila baratillo and others is that a section of it has developed into an antiques market. This section is centered on Comonfort Street and attracts collectors and tourists from both Mexico and abroad. It is {{the best known of}} a number of antiques markets including Mercardo Cuauhtemoc, Mercado de Alvaro Obregon and Plaza del Angel in Mexico City along with Callejón del Sapo in Puebla and El Baratillo in Guadalajara. The antiques market {{is one of the most}} traditional in Mexico City as interaction between seller and buyer is intense and personal. Good bargainers can get discounts of as much as thirty percent. As part of selling, many vendors will relate stories about the pieces, which may or may not be true. The market has attracted some foreign buyers and sellers and with the Internet and other sources of information, most sellers are more aware of the prices their items can fetch. In the past, this antiques market was known as cheap, but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> anymore.|$|E

One is that whereas we might expect in our everyday life {{that there would be}} some constraints on the points to which a particle can move, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> in full quantum electrodynamics. There is a possibility of an electron at A, or a photon at B, moving as a basic action to any other place and time in the universe. That includes places that could only be reached at speeds greater than that of light and also earlier times.

[...] "One prominent university president stated that three atomic bombs could destroy the United States. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true.</b> It has been said that radioactivity will kill everyone in a city not killed by the blast of a bomb. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true.</b> The effect of atomic radiation need not be fatal at all.

2500|$|The base {{had been}} a target for {{frequent}} mortar and rocket barrages since being set up in 2003, but Burbridge dismissed suggestions the British had been forced out of Amara while acknowledging the attacks had been {{one reason for the}} decision to withdraw, the second being that a static base did not fit with the new operation. [...] "Abu Naji was a bulls-eye {{in the middle of a}} dartboard. The attacks were a nuisance and were a contributing factor in our planning", to quit the base, he said, adding [...] "By no longer presenting a static target, we reduce the ability of the militias to strike us..We understand the militias in Maysan province are using this as an example that we have been pushed out of Abu Naji, but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true.</b> It was very rare for us to take casualties."

2500|$|In {{a rather}} {{different}} notice written in 1350, Ludolph of Sudheim, a parish priest from Westphalia, correctly {{refers to the}} Pyramids as sepulchers, and says [...] "these tombs are called by the natives Pharaoh's granaries." [...] Some twenty years earlier the German Dominican William of Boldensele had traveled about Egypt and left (1336) a very critical account of the notion: [...] "the simple people of the country say that these were Pharaoh's barns and granaries in which Joseph had the wheat kept {{in the time of}} the great famine mentioned in the Bible ... But this cannot be true at all, for no place for putting in the wheat can be found there, and there is in inside these columns no empty space where anything can be placed. [...] For from top to bottom they are closed and made entirely of huge stones well joined to one another—except that there is a very small door quite high above the ground and a very narrow and very dark little passage through which one descends there for a certain distance, but it is not all wide enough to put grain in, as those of the country say and believe." [...] The German knight's memoir would provide the framework, and many of the details, {{for one of the most}} popular books of the late Middle Ages, the Travels of John Mandeville (1356). [...] The supposed author most likely did not visit the locales in his narrative, and in the case of his account of the Pyramids, he actually reverses the conclusions and reasoning of William: [...] "these are Joseph’s Granaries, which he had made to store the wheat for hard times ... Some say that they are tombs of the great lords of antiquity, but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true,</b> for the common word through the whole country near and far is that they are Joseph's Granaries, and they have it written thus in their chronicles. [...] On the other hand, if they were tombs, they would not be empty inside, nor would they have entrances for going inside, nor are tombs ever made of such a large size and such a height—which is why it is not to be believed that they are tombs." ...|$|E
