40|$|The family Mactridae is {{composed}} of {{a diverse group of}} marine organisms, commonly known as <b>trough</b> <b>shells</b> or surf clams, which illustrate a global distribution. Although this family includes some of the most fished and cultured bivalve species, their chromosomes are poorly studied. In this work, we analyzed the chromosomes of Spisula solida, Spisula subtruncata and Mactra stultorum by means of fluorochrome staining, C-banding and fluorescent in situ hybridization using 28 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), 5 S rDNA, H 3 histone gene and telomeric probes. All three <b>trough</b> <b>shells</b> presented 2 n = 38 chromosomes but different karyotype compositions. As happens in most bivalves, GC-rich regions were limited to the nucleolus organizing regions in Spisula solida. In contrast, many GC-rich heterochromatic bands were detected in both Spisula subtruncata and Mactra stultorum. Although the three <b>trough</b> <b>shells</b> presented single 5 S rDNA and H 3 histone gene clusters, their chromosomal locations differed. Regarding major rDNA clusters, while Spisula subtruncata presented a single cluster, both Spisula solida and Mactra stultorum showed two. No evidence of intercalary telomeric signals was detected in these species. The molecular cytogenetic characterization of these taxa will contribute to understanding the role played by chromosome changes in the evolution of <b>trough</b> <b>shells...</b>|$|R

Calculations of time trends indicated {{that on the}} whole concentrations of trace metals had significantly decreased since 1981, also on dredged material dumping sites.

40|$|Stratification and {{estimated}} paleoflow conditions for valley-fill deposits suggest that Ogallala Group streams in western Nebraska {{were similar to}} modern streams of south-central Alberta. Ogallala stratification includes medium-scale (0. 5 to 2. 0 m <b>thick)</b> <b>trough</b> crossbedded sand and gravel, tabular indistinctly horizontally bedded and imbricated gravel, and horizontally bedded sand and pebbly sand. Valley fills are 15 to 55 m thick and 800 to 1800 m wide at the top. Some are in bedrock-floored channels resembling the “inner channels” of Shepherd and Schumm (1974). Gradients for three well exposed paleovalley floors range from 0. 0014 to 0. 0020 (m/m) after tectonic correction. This compares with 0. 00135 for the modem North Platte River Valley in Nebraska. The average intermediate diameters of the 10 largest clasts from tabular gravel beds found at 17 sites varied between 0. 077 and 0. 15 m. The average median intermediate diameter for gravel from four well exposed tabular gravel beds is 0. 024 m. Consistent paleodepth estimates of about 2 m correlate well with the scale of cross-stratification observed in the valley fills. Paleovelocities are estimated at about 2 m/sec, and Froude numbers of about 0. 4 are consistent with a lower flow regime in the stability field of dunes. Two-dimensional specific in-channel paleodischarges were 3 to 4 m 2 /sec. Total paleodischarge estimates based on slope-discharge relationships for gravel-bed rivers range from 340 to 1240 m 3 /sec and are comparable to average annual peak discharges on the North Platte River reported 80 to 90 years ago. Ogallala streams were probably dominated by macroforms similar to the “crescent-shaped bars” of the North Saskatchewan River. Deposition also took place on longitudinal bars in deeper channels. Shallow upper-flow regime transport and deposition is recorded by horizontally bedded sand and pebbly sand...|$|R
40|$|During {{the period}} of investigation, two {{stations}} in the dumping site and six reference stations were monitored. In water and sediments only the iron content, a key parameter, was determined. In benthos, Fe, Cr, Ni, Zn, Pb, Cu and Cd were assessed. The iron content was very similar in both the dumping area and in five reference stations (0. 06 - 0. 08 mg/ 1). In the station nearest to the coast however, the concentrations were 2 to 3 times higher, showing the influence of river inputs. There was no temporal trend. A lack of dissolved oxygen was never observed and no marked differences between the eight areas were noted indicating that the oxidation of Fe++, {{the main component of}} the waste stream, had no measurable consequences in the water column. Abnormally low pH-values were not observed. In the sediments, no temporal trend in iron concentrations could be detected. No higher amounts were noted in the dumping area. The concentration of iron {{did not appear to be}} linked directly to the disposal of titanium dioxide waste but to input sources in general. The distance to the coast seems to play an important role. The iron content in the total mud fraction (< 63 µm) decreased seawards (from ca 4. 2 to 0. 12 g/kg) up to about 20 nautical miles. In sea star (Asterias rubens), hermit crab (Pagurus bernhardus), swimming crab (Macropipus holsatus) brittle star (Ophiura texturata) and cut <b>trough</b> <b>shell</b> (Spisula subtruncata), there was neither a clear temporal trend nor evidence of accumulation of metals due to the dumping of titanium dioxide waste. Nevertheless, large amounts of heavy metals associated with particulate matter can be carried over long distances before being deposited. For this reason, all dumpings were banned since 1990...|$|R
40|$|Virions of mouse leukemia virus {{spread on}} glass {{substrates}} were visualized by atomic force microscopy. The size distribution mode was 145 nm, significantly {{larger than that}} for human immunodeficiency virus particles. The distribution of particle sizes is broad, indicating that no two particles are likely identical in content or surface features. Virions possess knoblike protrusions, which may represent vestiges of budding from cell membranes. Particles which split open allowed imaging of intact cores with diameters of 65 nm. They also permitted estimation of viral shell thickness (35 to 40 nm) and showed {{the presence of a}} distinct <b>trough</b> between the <b>shell</b> and the core surface.

40|$|The {{bivalves}} of the Noordzeekanaal (Mollusca: Bivalvia) In recent years, the macrobenthos of the Noordzeekanaal area, west of Amsterdam, {{has been}} surveyed intensively. The area {{consists of a}} main, brackish channel {{and a set of}} deep sea harbours. It was discovered that several bivalve species were present in large numbers. Many findings came as a surprise. Especially noteworthy is the presence of a (formerly unknown) sizeable population of lagoon cockle Cerastoderma glaucum. This species has only a sparce distribution in the Netherlands (and surrounding countries). Also, the sand gaper Mya arenaria was found to be remarkably common in many places. The false dark mussel Mytilopsis leucophaeata was already known to be abundant on stony substrate alongside the canal, but was found to be locally abundant on the channel bottom as well. The findings of the marine common basket shell Corbula gibba and peppershell Abra nitida were remarkable. Both species seem to have become more common since the late 1990 s in deep, man-made waters like channels and inland brackish harbours. Several other marine species were found in small numbers: cut <b>trough</b> <b>shell</b> Spisula subtruncata, razor clam Ensis directus, American piddock Petricola pholadiformis, edible cockle Cerastoderma edule and Baltic tellin Macoma balthica. These have probably reached the area through the IJmuiden-sluices. Also, some fresh water species were found: zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, painter’s mussel Unio pictorum as well as both Asian clams Corbicula fluminea and C. fluminalis. Towards the end of the 19 th century the Noordzeekanaal was constructed. The former IJ was largely reclaimed, reducing the habitat of the sand gaper and lagoon cockle to just a narrow channel of 25 km long and several km wide, in total less than 10 % of the original distribution area of these species. When the Zuiderzee was closed in 1932, the water of the Noordzeekanaal turned fresher. On top of this, the Second World War had the IJmuiden sluices closed, reducing the inlet of seawater into the Noordzeekanaal. However, we assume that both the lagoon cockle and sand gaper have not disappeared from the Noordzeekanaal. A sufficient amount of brackish water remained over the bottom of Noordzeekanaal, sufficient to sustain a small population of both sand gaper and lagoon cockle. The stratification of the Noordzeekanaal-water has surely played a role in this, as the salt water was forced down (halocline). A completely fresh water situation on the bottom was never reached. Thus, we suggest that the populations of sand gaper and lagoon cockle have survived as relics from the Zuiderzee-era...|$|R
50|$|Small sonar systems {{attached}} to floating buoys, called sonobuoys {{have been used}} by geologists to shoot seismic transects across the Adare Basin in order to establish 2D velocity models of the subsurface stratigraphy beneath the seafloor down to a depth of 5.5 km. The deeper deposited sediment has been compacted under heavier pressures for longer time periods, causing the sediment to become denser and the velocity of the seismic waves to increase with depth. Velocities from beneath the Adare Trough tend to be slightly higher than the average, indicating that the lithosphere is slightly <b>thicker</b> underneath the <b>trough</b> than the surrounding basin. Within the depth capable of measurement 6 distinct stratigraphic units have been established with characteristic velocities. The first unit begins at the seafloor with a velocity of 2000 m/s. The second unit lies 0.6 km beneath the seafloor and waves propagate with a velocity of 3000 m/s. The third layer begins at 1.8 km beneath the seafloor and has a velocity of 4200 m/s. The next layer begins at 2.3 km and has a velocity of 4900 m/s, followed by a layer at 3.1 km with 5700 m/s wave velocity. The final layer lies 3.3 km beneath the surface and displays velocities of 6000 m/s.|$|R

40|$|The major stratigraphic {{units of}} the Fort Cooper Coal Measures (FCCM) have been reviewed, and an {{internal}} coal seam architecture using 500 wireline logs in the Bowen Basin, southeast Queensland has been developed. The subdivisions of the coal measures include the Burngrove Formation, Middle Main Seam and Fair Hill Formation in the northern Bowen Basin. To {{the south of the}} basin, the Middle Main Seam is interpreted as the stratigraphic equivalent of Black Alley Shale Formation. The Yarrabee Tuff forms the top boundary of the coal measures and is distributed basin-wide except over the southern Denison and southern Taroom troughs. Accessory tuffs beneath the Yarrabee Tuff aided seam level correlation. The geometries of coal seams have been analysed for each morphotectonic zone of the Bowen Basin using gravity data, which highlight high and low topographic sites. The Collinsville Shelf in northwest of the Bowen Basin comprises thick and merged Burngrove and Fair Hill formation coals that split towards northeast in the Nebo Synclinorium and southeast in Taroom Trough. Coal seams split into daughter seams from north to south and are named as first, second or third order, {{based on the number of}} splits that occurred. First- and second-order splitting occurs at the boundary of the Nebo Synclinorium and Collinsville Shelf, at the Narrows of Nebo Synclinorium and Comet Ridge. Further, third- and fourth-order splitting occurs at the boundary of the Comet Ridge and Taroom Trough. Splitting zones found at the junction of morphotectonic zones are related to a change in subsidence. In addition, the association of split seams with coarse grain-dominated interburden reflects increased accommodation in low-lying areas such as the Nebo Synclinorium and the <b>troughs.</b> <b>Thick</b> and coalesced coal seams are associated with shelves and ridges of the basin reflecting low accommodation sites. Hence, the variation in the coal seam architecture of FCCM responds to the subsidence associated with different morphotectonic zones of the basin...|$|R
40|$|In {{the western}} Sirt Basin, {{sedimentation}} during the Late Paleocene was characterized broadly by shallow-marine carbonates, local build-ups and deeper-water shales and marls on the Dahra Platform {{and in the}} Dor al Abid/Zallah Troughs. Seven lithofacies and eleven associated microfacies have been recognised within the Selandian/Thanetian carbonate succession in the study area, and these range from mud-supported carbonates to grain-dominated facies. The Dahra Formation on the Dahra Platform was deposited on a homoclinal carbonate ramp with inner, mid and probably outer ramp facies, each with distinctive sub-facies and microfacies. The similarity of facies and associated microfacies throughout the Dahra Formation suggest deposition under similar conditions throughout {{the east and west}} Dahra Fields on the Dahra Platform, and these persisted during deposition of the Zelten and Harash Formations. The Mabruk Member, which consists mainly of shallow-water carbonates bounded above and below by deeper-marine shale and marl, accumulated in lagoonal and reefal environments, probably in a rimmed-shelf setting. Different types of diagenetic alteration occurred at various stages in the Paleocene sedimentʼs history including dissolution, cementation and compaction. Primary and secondary types of porosity were developed within the studied rocks, particularly in the Dahra Formation, where the depositional facies, diagenesis and the pattern of carbonate cycles {{played an important role in}} porosity creation and preservation. The Selandian/Thanetian succession is dominated by a regressive trend, especially on the Dahra Platform, which resulted in the development of shallowing-up cycles. Numerous key surfaces have been documented with characteristic funnel-shaped and bell-shaped log patterns, based on which a number of depositional sequences have been recognized. These sequences comprise both transgressive systems tract and highstand systems tract and are commonly defined by transgressive surfaces, particularly on the Dahra Platform. The possible lack of reef-building organisms along with tectonic subsidence and/or significant sea-level rise resulted in the development of a drowning unconformity on the top of the Mabruk Member. The thickness of the entire Paleocene succession is generally <b>thicker</b> in the <b>trough</b> areas and thinner over the platform. The latter is dominated by uniform and monotonous strata with a significant thickness of shallow-marine carbonates, suggesting relative stability in tectonics, sea-level and climate. The high temperature recorded from the aqueous inclusions in the Thanetian section is possibly due to the passage of hydrothermal fluids from deeper parts of the area; the high thermal conductivity of carbonates, along with the Mid-Late Tertiary uplift and erosion may also have been involved. The overall similarity of the Paleocene palaeotopography suggests that differential subsidence and sea-level fluctuation were the dominant process that controlled the spatial and temporal variation of the Paleocene facies. ...|$|R
