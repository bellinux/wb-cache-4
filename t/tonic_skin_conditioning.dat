The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effects of the suggestions of analgesia on the responses to cpt in healthy highs (n = 22) and in low hypnotisable participants (lows, n = 22) out of hypnosis. Cpt was administered without (CPT) and with suggestions for analgesia (CPT+AN). Psychophysical (pain intensity, pain threshold, cpt duration (time of immersion) and pain tolerance, defined as the difference between cpt duration and pain threshold), respiratory (amplitude and frequency) and autonomic variables (<b>tonic</b> <b>skin</b> conductance, mean RR interval (RR = 1 /heart rate), blood pressure, skin blood flow) were studied. The suggestions for analgesia increased cpt duration and RR in both groups, but decreased pain intensity and enhanced pain threshold only in highs; in both groups they did not modulate systolic blood pressure, <b>tonic</b> <b>skin</b> conductance and skin blood flow; thus, increased parasympathetic activity appears responsible for the heart rate reduction induced by suggestions in both groups. In conclusion, our findings show that suggestions modulate pain experience differentially in highs and lows, and are partially effective also in lows.

Results indicated that children had significantly higher coordination indices across all speaking tasks, indicating more variable speech motor coordination. Increases in syntactic complexity and utterance length were associated with increases in the speech motor coordination variability in both speaker groups.

The numbing suggestion reduced fear-related emotional experience and autonomic responses; if No-Threat preceded Threat, the heart rate, heart rate variability and blood pressure were also reduced during Threat, in spite of self reports of high negative emotion. Thus, 1) the subjective experience and the autonomic response to fear can be dissociated; 2) the efficacy of numbing suggestion is extended to a subsequent Threat stimulation; 3) habituation does not contribute to the numbing effect.

Microfilm. ix, 175 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmAlthough it {{has been}} {{frequently}} claimed that regular physical exercise possesses stress-reducing properties, the actual scientific evidence which exists to support this claim is sparse. In addition, the relevant literature has almost exclusively emphasized endurance forms of exercise which contribute to an enhancement of cardiovascular fitness levels. When assessing the effects of cardiovascular fitness alone, the variables of fitness and exercise are by definition confounded, since {{it is difficult to}} enhance cardiovascular fitness without regular exercise. It is possible however, to regularly engage in some forms of exercise without significantly increasing cardiovascular fitness. The present study was designed {{to examine the effects of}} stress induction on several psychophysiological measures as a function of both cardiovascular fitness and exercise. Fifty-five male subjects were exposed to four psychological stressors, and effects on heart rate, <b>tonic</b> <b>skin</b> conductance levels, digital skin temperature, and forearm electromyogram were assessed. General linear model analyses revealed three major findings: 1. While quantity of exercise made no difference for Ss with high fitness levels, for Ss with low fitness levels high quantities of exercise resulted in a potentiation of the stress response. This was interpreted to mean that when an individual's fitness level is low. the act of engaging in high quantities of exercise may actually serve as a stressor itself. 2. When differences in stressor levels were controlled. Ss high in cardiovascular fitness demonstrated lower heart rate levels white recovering from exposure to the stressors. These results suggest that there may be a limited reduction in physiological reactivity to psychological stressors as a function of cardiovascular fitness. 3. When frequency of exercise was held constant, Ss who spent less time per session of exercise showed lower recovery skin conductance levels than those who spent more time per exercise session. suggesting there may be some optimal relationship between frequency and amount of exercise for reducing reactivity to psychological stressors. The results of this study clearly challenge the simple notion that "exercise reduces stress", and indicate that at the least this relationship is mediated by interrelationships between cardiovascular fitness, amount of exercise, and frequency of exercise...|$|R
40|$|Most brain related {{databases}} {{bring together}} specialized information, {{with a growing}} number that include neuroimaging measures. This article outlines the potential use and insights from the first entirely standardized and centralized database, which integrates information from neuroimaging measures (EEG, event related potential (ERP), structural/functional MRI), arousal (skin conductance responses (SCR) s, heart rate, respiration), neuropsychological and personality tests, genomics and demographics: The Brain Resource International Database. It comprises data from over 2, 000 “normative” subjects {{and a growing number}} of patients with neurological and psychiatric illnesses, acquired from over 50 laboratories (in the USA, United Kingdom, Holland, South Africa, Israel and Australia), all with identical equipment and experimental procedures. Three primary goals of this database are to quantify individual differences in normative brain function, to compare an individual's performance to their database peers, and to provide a robust normative framework for clinical assessment and treatment prediction. We present three example demonstrations in relation to these goals. First, we show how consistent age differences may be quantified when large subject numbers are available, using EEG and ERP data from nearly 2, 000 stringently screened normative subjects. Second, the use of a normalization technique provides a means to compare clinical subjects (50 ADHD subjects in this study) to the normative database with the effects of age and gender taken into account. Third, we show how a profile of EEG/ERP and autonomic measures potentially provides a means to predict treatment response in ADHD subjects. The example data consists of EEG under eyes open and eyes closed and ERP data for auditory oddball, working memory and Go-NoGo paradigms. Autonomic measures of <b>skin</b> conductance (<b>tonic</b> <b>skin</b> conductance level, SCL, and phasic skin conductance responses, SCRs) were acquired simultaneously with central EEG/ERP measures. The findings show that the power of large samples, tested using standardized protocols, allows for the quantification of individual differences that can subsequently be used to control such variation and to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of comparisons between normative and clinical groups. In terms of broader significance, the combination of size and multidimensional measures tapping the brain's core cognitive competencies, may provide a normative and evidence-based framework for individually-based assessments in “Personalized Medicine. ”. © 2005, EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society.

Denna studie undersökte fenotypiska och genetiska relationer mellan komponenter i the <b>skin</b> {{conductance}} fear <b>conditioning</b> task och i psykopatiska personlighetsdrag. Data hämtades från den longitudinella studien; Tvillingstudie om riskfaktorer för antisocialt beteende (RFAB) vid University of Southern California och data från pågående tillfälle 5 inkluderades i studien. Resultatet visade på betydelsen av både genetiska och icke-gemensamma miljö influenser förklarade variansen i obetingad respons. I överensstämmelse med tidigare forskning visade resultaten att individer som visade på högre nivåer av manipulativt och svekfullt beteende också uppvisade större brister i rädslobetingelser. Previous {{studies have}} shown a relationship among fearlessness, psychopathy, aggression and antisocial behavior. This study examined the phenotypic and genetic relationships among components of the <b>skin</b> conductance fear <b>conditioning</b> task and psychopathic personality traits. Data were retrieved from a longitudinal study; the Twin Study of Risk Factor for Antisocial Behavior at the University of Southern California. The present study included data from the ongoing Wave 5. Results indicated the importance of both genetic and non-shared environmental influences in explaining {{the variance in the}} unconditioned response. Consistent with previous research, the results showed that individuals who displayed higher levels of manipulative and deceitful traits also showed deficits in fear conditioning...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study patients' electrodermal {{response}} (1) to an interviewer's empathic statements vs. inattention to emotional concerns and (2) {{to the emotional}} content in clinical interviews. METHODS: Patients with fibromyalgia (n= 48) were given a clinical interview in a randomized 2 × 2 design, in which interviewer empathic or inattentive behavior (scenario A) and the emotional or neutral content of the interview (scenario B) were manipulated. Electrodermal activity (EDA) was measured during the interview. The patients' affective state (PANAS) and patient satisfaction were also assessed. RESULTS: In scenario A {{a significant main effect}} of empathy was found, indicating an increased <b>tonic</b> EDA (<b>skin</b> conduction level, SCL) during the empathy condition (p<. 05). In scenario B there was a main effect of empathy (p<. 01) and a significant empathy×content interaction effect (p<. 01). There was a strong positive association between empathy and patient satisfaction (p<. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: Empathic statements by the interviewer were associated with increased SCL in patients, most so in interviews with emotional content. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Psychophysiological variables such as EDA may be applied in clinical communication research on emotional communication, but the limitations of such measures should also be recognized.
