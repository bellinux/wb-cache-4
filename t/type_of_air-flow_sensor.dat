This paper addresses the latest developments in fabrication and array interfacing <b>of</b> biomimetic artificial <b>air-flow</b> <b>sensors.</b> Hair flow sensors in wafer level arrays have been successfully fabricated using SOI wafers with deep trench isolation structures. Using a Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) technique, we were able to simultaneously measure flow signals at multiple sensor positions.

40|$|Self-validation {{of sensors}} is {{often based on}} model {{parameters}} estimation by calibration. In order to “repair ” the sensor’s behavior by correction of the model parameters, {{it is important to}} identify which properties are the reasons for losses of accuracies failures. In this contribution a general method for the investigation of classical and so-called non-classical calibration schemes (with a number of reference points of the measuring value being fewer than parameters to estimate) is presented. Based on evaluation of the functional determinant, i. e. the determinant of the Jacobi matrix, it is examined whether variations of working points at reference conditions instead of reference points of the measurement value could be used for the parameter estimation. In principle, with the presented method all kinds of automatic self-calibration of sensors can be analyzed. As examples, the calibration of two different distance sensors as well as the zero-point calibration of semiconductor gas sensors and the self-calibration <b>of</b> an <b>air-flow</b> <b>sensor</b> are discussed...|$|R

Supplementary tests were made {{to determine the effect}} of lubricating-oil temperature, cooling-water temperature, and compression ratio on the friction mean {{effective pressure}} of the single-cylinder test engine. Friction curves are included for two 9 -cylinder, radial, compression-ignition aircraft engines.

High compression ratio accounts for approximately 5 pounds per square inch mean effective pressure of the friction of these single-cylinder compression-ignition engines.

Among many possibilities of utilizing biomass for energy generation, combustion is the most common. With the aim of improving and optimizing the combustion process of crop residues, an experimental rig for straw combustion in a fixed bed was constructed. This paper gives a brief review of working characteristics of the experimental rig, as well as the results for three different measuring regimes, with the purpose to investigate the effect <b>of</b> <b>air-flow</b> rate on the wheat straw combustion in a fixed bed. For all three regimes analysed in this paper bulk density of the bed was the same, 60 kg/m 3, combustion air was without preheating and air-flow rates were: 1152, 1872, and 2124 kg/m 2 h.

These arguments are strongly supported by flow visualization and pressure measurements carried out in a laboratory wind-wave flume.

A minimum outdoor air exchange to ensure acceptable moisture and indoor air quality levels must be maintained. A model is introduced, that couples hygrothermal whole building simulation with a multi-zone air-flow simulation. This coupling allows assessing the combined effects <b>of</b> <b>air-flow</b> on building energy use, comfort conditions, air quality and possible hygric issues. An application example shows {{the use of the}} software for a low rise residential building. In a first step the parameterization <b>of</b> the <b>air-flow</b> network is checked by computing the resulting infiltration air-flow with closed windows. The maximum achievable natural air exchange for different window types and openings, like pivothung windows, windows opened with a small parallel gap around and side-hung windows is assessed. Based on these numbers it is assessed if any of the above mentioned opening options alone with a certain opening duration is able to achieve good indoor air quality and acceptable indoor moisture levels to avoid any hygric problems or if a combination of some of the measures is required. The presented dynamic hygrothermal whole building simulation coupled with a multi-zone air-flow model is capable of simulating the effects of different window opening options and strategies on building energy demand, indoor comfort conditions and air quality and on the hygrothermal building component performance.
