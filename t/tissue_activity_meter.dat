40|$|The {{technical}} performance of <b>activity</b> <b>meters</b> for automated detection of estrus in dairy farming has been studied, and such meters are already used in practice. However, {{information on the}} economic consequences of using <b>activity</b> <b>meters</b> is lacking. The current study analyzes the economic benefits of a sensor system for detection of estrus and appraises the feasibility of an investment in such a system. A stochastic dynamic simulation model was used to simulate reproductive performance of a dairy herd. The number of cow places in this herd was fixed at 130. The model started with 130 randomly drawn cows (in a Monte Carlo process) and simulated calvings and replacement of these cows in subsequent years. Default herd characteristics were a conception rate of 50 %, an 8 -wk dry-off period, and an average milk production level of 8, 310 kg per cow per 305 d. Model inputs were derived from real farm data and expertise. For the analysis, visual detection by the farmer (“without” situation) was compared with automated detection with <b>activity</b> <b>meters</b> (“with” situation). For visual estrus detection, an estrus detection rate of 50 % and a specificity of 100 % were assumed. For automated estrus detection, an estrus detection rate of 80 % and a specificity of 95 % were assumed. The results of the cow simulation model were used to estimate {{the difference between the}} annual net cash flows in the “with” and “without” situations (marginal financial effect) and the internal rate of return (IRR) as profitability indicators. The use of <b>activity</b> <b>meters</b> led to improved estrus detection and, therefore, to a decrease in the average calving interval and subsequent increase in annual milk production. For visual estrus detection, the average calving interval was 419 d and average annual milk production was 1, 032, 278 kg. For <b>activity</b> <b>meters,</b> the average calving interval was 403 d and the average annual milk production was 1, 043, 398 kg. It was estimated that the initial investment in <b>activity</b> <b>meters</b> would cost € 17, 728 for a herd of 130 cows, with an additional cost of € 90 per year for the replacement of malfunctioning <b>activity</b> <b>meters.</b> Changes in annual net cash flows arising from using an <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> included extra revenues from increased milk production and number of calves sold, increased costs from more inseminations, calvings, and feed consumption, and reduced costs from fewer culled cows and less labor for estrus detection. These changes in cash flows were caused mainly by changes in the technical results of the simulated dairy herds, which arose from differences in the estrus detection rate and specificity between the “with” and “without” situations. The average marginal financial effect in the “with” and “without” situations was € 2, 827 for the baseline scenario, with an average IRR of 11 %. The IRR {{is a measure of the}} return on invested capital. Investment in <b>activity</b> <b>meters</b> was generally profitable. The most influential assumptions on the profitability of this investment were the assumed culling rules and the increase in sensitivity of estrus detection between the “without” and the “with” situation...|$|R

The radionuclide <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> was originally calibrated by the manufacturer. A constancy test for this calibrator was performed every morning as part of routine quality control using a 57 Co source where the read activity value was compared to the predicted value calculated by accounting for radioactive decay. From 2007 to 2011, three 57 Co sources, each from a different vendor, {{were used for the}} test. The initial activities of these sources (185, 185, and 370  MBq) were provided by the vendors and were traceable to NIST standards. Note that {{the results of this study}} would not be affected by the accuracy of the <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> calibration as only the variability of the calibration factor was studied. In addition, only the constancy, the difference between the indicated and true activity of the calibration source, was used in the statistical analysis. Records of the accuracy of the activity of the sources used for the constancy test are not available. However, current sources were purchased from Eckert & Ziegler (Berlin, Germany) and have an accuracy of ± 5 %. A plot of the constancy values over time showed no discontinuities due to source changes. A reproducibility test (ten successive measurements [15]) performed with the same 57 Co source showed a variability of 0.1 % of the calibration source activity measurement for this radionuclide <b>activity</b> <b>meter.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{calibration}} factors {{calculated as}} part of 131 I-tositumomab patient dosimetry scans used in treatment planning performed over a 4 -year period were retrospectively analyzed. Raw data included total counts in whole-body images of a radioactive calibration source, {{the activity of the}} source measured in a radionuclide <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> (often referred to as a dose calibrator), and the background count rate obtained at three time points for each patient. The count rate from extrinsic flood source acquisitions and radionuclide <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> constancy obtained on the same day as each image were also used. The data were analyzed statistically using a mixed-effects model to determine the factors affecting variations in the measured calibration factors.|$|R
30|$|Averaging the {{calibration}} source activity over measurements made {{on different}} days resulted in reduced {{importance of the}} intra-source variance. The most important variance components for the calibration factor CFdA, which used {{the average of the}} measured calibration source activity over the three time points, were the inter-calibration source (77 %), intra-calibration source (14 %), and background count rate components (9 %). Approximately 54 % of this intra-calibration source variation was explained by variance due to Poisson noise, which could be reduced by longer calibration source image acquisition times or higher calibration source activities. The use of the average of the calibration source activity decreased the standard deviation of the calibration factor to 1.8 %, a 23 % reduction, and decreased the effect of radionuclide <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> variability on the calibration factor estimate. This indicates that the radionuclide <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> should not be considered as a simple fixed effect but as a combination of fixed and random effects. A part of the random component {{may be due to the}} variable positioning of the calibration source inside the radionuclide <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> leading to variability of the calibration source activity measurement [15]. The remaining variance in the intra-calibration source component may be due to the variability of the bed speed during the whole-body acquisition, the calibration source position in the camera field of view, the calibration source position on the bed, or variations in the distance between the calibration source and the detectors. Imprecision or inaccuracy in the manually recorded time of the calibration source activity measurement or unsynchronized clocks between the radionuclide <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> and the camera may also explain some of this intra-calibration source variance component.|$|R

30|$|The {{development}} of SPECT reconstruction methods including advanced corrections for physical interactions {{in the patient}} and detectors has provided the ability to obtain images with absolute activity quantification using SPECT/CT imaging. However, the conversion of voxel values to activity units, which is performed {{with the use of}} a calibration factor, is not well standardized and methods to reliably estimate this factor are needed. In this work, we focused on a calibration factor obtained from a planar acquisition of a small calibration source imaged in air due to its relative simplicity. We evaluated the repeatability of this method and studied the factors that affect the variability of the resulting calibration factor. The calibration factor estimate was obtained based on acquisition of an image of a vial containing a measured quantity of the radionuclide of interest before each patient image acquisition. The process of filling a new vial for each patient and the use of a radionuclide <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> to measure the calibration source activity for each acquisition were potential sources of variability. The constancy test performed as part of daily radionuclide <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> quality control was used as an indicator of radionuclide <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> instrumentation variability. The background count rate, another potential source of variability, was measured by a planar acquisition without any calibration source in the field of view and was subtracted from the calibration source count rate. Finally, the calibration factor repeatability could be affected by variations in camera sensitivity or table speed over time. A sensitivity factor calculated from a daily 57 Co extrinsic flood acquisition, also acquired as part of routine quality control, was used to evaluate the impact of the camera sensitivity variations that are independent of radionuclide and collimator on the calibration factor measurement. In order to estimate the components of the total variance of the calibration factor and to determine the parameters that affect the variability of the calibration factor, a mixed-effects model was used to analyze the data.|$|R
