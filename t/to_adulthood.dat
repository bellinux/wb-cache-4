5|$|Henry was by now fully {{determined}} {{to take the}} throne, but presenting a rationale for this action proved a dilemma. It was argued that Richard, through his tyranny and misgovernment, had rendered himself unworthy of being king. However, Henry was not next in line to the throne; the heir presumptive was Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, who was descended from Edward III's third son, the second to survive <b>to</b> <b>adulthood,</b> Lionel of Antwerp. Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt, was Edward's fourth son, the third to survive <b>to</b> <b>adulthood.</b> The problem was solved by emphasising Henry's descent in a direct male line, whereas March's descent was through his grandmother.|$|E

40|$|Leisure is an {{important}} context in which human development occurs. Changes in leisure behavior patterns may indicate changing developmental needs or reflect contextual changes that impact leisure behavior. The transition from adolescence <b>to</b> young <b>adulthood</b> provides an excellent opportunity {{for the study of}} the stability of leisure behavior as individuals' contexts are changed with the adoption of adult roles and the potential for disruption of leisure patterns exists. Previous studies investigating leisure and the transition from adolescence <b>to</b> young <b>adulthood</b> have tended <b>to</b> be cross-sectional and focus on specific leisure behaviors rather than identifying patterns of leisure behavior. The present study involved a longitudinal investigation of leisure behavior patterns over a three-year period during the transition from adolescence <b>to</b> young <b>adulthood,</b> and determined the nature of leisure pattern stability and instability during this period. In general, leisure pattern stability was the most common pathway into young adulthood. The patterns of leisure behavior and the nature of the changes that occurred with the transition from adolescence <b>to</b> young <b>adulthood</b> differed <b>to</b> some degree for males and females, although similarities in patterns and transitions were also found...|$|R

5|$|Although Clinch {{believed}} that the evidence pointed to the twins having genuinely existed but that they {{had lived in the}} 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally claimed, they are not mentioned in any journals or books from the period. This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617– after1646) had prompted great interest in conjoined twins, and conjoined sisters surviving <b>to</b> <b>adulthood</b> in south east England would have been widely noted.|$|E
5|$|Arundel was {{considered}} a great soldier by his contemporaries. He had been a successful commander in France, {{in a period of}} decline for the English, and his death was a great loss to his country. He was succeeded by his son Humphrey, who did not live <b>to</b> <b>adulthood.</b> The title of Earl of Arundel then went to John's younger brother William.|$|E

The family was Lutheran. He had two half-siblings (Else and Walter Bormann) from his father's earlier {{marriage}} to Louise Grobler, who died in 1898. Antonie Bormann gave birth to three sons, one of whom died in infancy.

5|$|In general, {{researchers}} in the field focus on development of cognitive flexibility {{between the ages of}} three and five. However, cognitive flexibility {{has been shown to be}} a broad concept that can be studied with all different ages and situations. Thus, with tasks ranging from simple to more complex, research suggests that there is a developmental continuum that spans from infancy <b>to</b> <b>adulthood.</b>|$|E
5|$|Invisible Circles is {{a concept}} album about the {{dynamics}} of quarrelsome families and psychological child abuse.

There are allegations that Marx also fathered a son, Freddy, out of wedlock by his housekeeper, Helene Demuth.|$|E
