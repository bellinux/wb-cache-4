5|$|The Parliament {{challenged}} {{this decision}} splitting their working arrangements, {{declaring that the}} division of its activities between three states was against <b>the</b> <b>treaties</b> and the natural prerogatives of a Parliament elected by direct universal suffrage, claiming {{the right to decide}} its own workings to its own efficiency. In response, leaders annexed the decision to the Treaty of Amsterdam, including it in <b>the</b> <b>treaties.</b>|$|E
5|$|The United States Attorney for Washington then filed a suit {{to enforce}} the treaty rights of the tribe. The trial {{court held that the}} {{property}} rights of the Winans allowed them to exclude others from the property, including the Indians. In 1905, the United States Supreme Court reversed that decision, holding that the tribe had reserved fishing rights when they ceded the property to the United States. Since the tribes had the right to fish reserved in <b>the</b> <b>treaties,</b> the federal government and subsequent owners had no greater property rights than were granted by <b>the</b> <b>treaties.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the signing}} of <b>the</b> <b>Treaties</b> of Versailles brought {{an end to the}} Anglo-French War, Agamemnon {{returned}} from the West Indies to Chatham, where she was paid off and docked on 29 October 1783 for repairs and to have her copper sheathing replaced. She came out of dock on 4 June 1784, and was subsequently laid up in ordinary.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Lisbon (initially {{known as}} <b>the</b> Reform <b>Treaty)</b> is an {{international}} agreement which amends <b>the</b> two <b>treaties</b> which form <b>the</b> constitutional basis of the European Union (EU). <b>The</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Lisbon was signed by the EU member states on 13 December 2007, and entered into force on 1 December 2009.

5|$|Brandenburg changed {{sides in}} return for Polish {{withdrawal}} of claims to Ducal Prussia, declaring Frederick William the sole sovereign in the Duchy with <b>the</b> <b>treaties</b> of Wehlau on 19 September and Bromberg on 6 November. In addition, the aforementioned treaties secured Brandenburg the Lands of Lauenburg and Bütow at the border of Brandenburgian Pomerania, while the Bishopric of Ermeland was returned to Poland.|$|E
5|$|Hughes, in {{his speech}} at the opening session of the conference on November 12, 1921, made the American proposal—the U.S would {{decommission}} or not build 30 warships if Great Britain did the same for 19 vessels, and Japan 17 ships. The secretary was generally successful, and agreements were reached on this and other points, including settlements to disputes over islands in the Pacific, and limitations {{on the use of}} poison gas. The naval agreement was limited to battleships and to some extent aircraft carriers, and in the end did not prevent rearmament. Nevertheless, Harding and Hughes were widely applauded in the press for their work. Harding had appointed Senator Lodge and the Senate Minority Leader, Alabama's Oscar Underwood, to the U.S. delegation; they helped ensure that <b>the</b> <b>treaties</b> made it through the Senate mostly unscathed, though that body added reservations to some of <b>the</b> <b>treaties.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 15 April, the first troops of the Italian Army entered Split, {{signifying}} the start of their occupation. On 21 April, civil control of Split passed from the NDH to Italian authorities, followed by the raising of the Italian flag over the city. On 18 May, Italy and the NDH signed <b>the</b> <b>Treaties</b> of Rome, confirming Italian rule of Dalmatia, including Split.|$|E

25|$|After Poltava, Peter the Great and Augustus the Strong allied {{again in}} <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Thorn (1709); Frederick IV of Denmark-Norway with Augustus the Strong in <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Dresden (1709); and Russia with Denmark–Norway in <b>the</b> {{subsequent}} <b>Treaty</b> of Copenhagen. In <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Hanover (1710), Brunswick-Lüneburg (Hanover) whose elector {{was to become}} George I of Great Britain allied with Russia. In 1713, Brandenburg-Prussia allied with Russia in <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Schwedt. George I of Great Britain and Hanover concluded three alliances in 1715: <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Berlin with Denmark–Norway, <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Stettin with Brandenburg-Prussia, and <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Greifswald with Russia.|$|R
50|$|In 1842, the Daoguang Emperor {{entrusted}} Keying {{to conclude}} a peace <b>treaty</b> with <b>the</b> Britain following the First Opium War, {{and he was}} chiefly responsible for negotiating and signing <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Nanking. <b>The</b> following year, he signed <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of <b>the</b> Bogue to supplement <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Nanking. He also concluded <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Wanghia (1844) with the United States, <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Whampoa (1844) with France, and <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Canton (1847) with Sweden-Norway.

5|$|Russian {{interest}} in the Caucasus soon waned after Peter's death in 1725 as its leaders pulled their forces back across the Terek River. and the gained territories in the North and South Caucasus were ceded back to Iran (now led by Nader Shah) per <b>the</b> <b>treaties</b> of Resht and Ganja of 1732 and 1735, respeticely.|$|E
5|$|The ECSC {{was founded}} by the Treaty of Paris in 1951; however, there was no {{decision}} on where to base {{the institutions of the}} new community. <b>The</b> <b>treaties</b> allowed for the seat(s) to be decided by common accord of governments, and at a conference of the ECSC members on 23 July 1952 no permanent seat was decided.|$|E
5|$|The European Commission (EC) is an {{institution}} of the European Union, responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the EU treaties and managing the day-to-day business of the EU.

25|$|The text of <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> {{itself is}} {{included}} in <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Waitangi Act 1975, an act which established the Waitangi Tribunal to determine issues of breaches of <b>the</b> <b>Treaty.</b> <b>The</b> Act was initially prospective, but was later amended in 1985 so that claims dating from the signing of <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> could be investigated. The 1985 amendment also included the Māori text of <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> for <b>the</b> first time.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Sèvres was {{superseded}} by the Turkish-Armenian War of 1920. <b>The</b> following <b>Treaty</b> of Alexandropol stipulated that Armenia renounce {{the terms of}} <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Sèvres and its associated promises of awarding land from the region of [...] "Western Armenia" [...] to the Republic of Armenia, and declared <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Sèvres to be null and void. Because of the Soviet invasion of Armenia before the signing of <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Alexandropol, <b>the</b> Armenian parliament never {{had the chance to}} ratify it. <b>The</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Kars replaced <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Alexandropol in 1921; the newly formed Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic affirmed all of the terms of <b>the</b> previous <b>Treaty</b> of Alexandropol in <b>the</b> new <b>treaty.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Kars was ratified in Yerevan in fall 1922 by the unrecognized Soviet and Turkish governments.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Oliva, <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Copenhagen <b>the</b> {{same year}} and <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Cardis {{following}} year marked {{the high point}} of the Swedish Empire.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Treaties</b> of 1823 and 1826, {{although}} fraudulent {{at their}} roots, {{were allowed to}} stand. The legal obstacles to Indian land suits at the time made {{it almost impossible to}} obtain redress until monetary compensation was awarded the Senecas under the Indian Claims Commission in the late 1960s and early 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{meetings}} of the European Council, still {{commonly referred to as}} EU summits, are chaired by its president and take place at least twice every six months; usually in the Europa building in Brussels. Decisions of the European Council are taken by consensus, except where <b>the</b> <b>Treaties</b> provide otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Under Protocol 3, Jersey {{is part of}} the European Union Customs Union of the European Community. The common customs tariff, levies {{and other}} {{agricultural}} import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is free movement of goods and trade between the island and Member States. EU rules on freedom of movement for workers do not apply in Jersey. However, Article 4 of the Protocol requires the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that {{the scope of this article}} included any matter governed by <b>the</b> <b>Treaties</b> in a territory where <b>the</b> <b>Treaties</b> are fully applicable. The island is therefore within the scope of <b>the</b> <b>Treaties</b> to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister have attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The French blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey is not part of the single market in financial services. It is not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as movement of capital, company law or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135km south) and its close association with the financial sector of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., The Wall Street Journal) labelling the island a tax haven.|$|E
5000|$|The Crown’s expert {{historian}} Patterson dismantled {{the validity}} of <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of 1752 {{that was used to}} support Marshall’s case. Dr. Patterson indicated that <b>the</b> <b>treaty</b> did not apply to Mi’kmaq people outside of Shubenacadie and that <b>the</b> <b>treaty</b> was terminated by subsequent hostilities. (Chief Cope renounced and destroyed <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> himself six months after signing it.) [...] Marshall’s lawyers abandoned his reliance upon <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of 1752, and switched his focus to <b>the</b> Halifax <b>Treaties</b> of 1760-61.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>treaty</b> was {{patterned}} after <b>the</b> 1824 Anderson-Gual <b>Treaty</b> between <b>the</b> U.S. and Gran Colombia. Like <b>the</b> Anderson-Gual <b>Treaty,</b> <b>the</b> 1825 <b>treaty</b> granted reciprocal most-favored-nation trading status. The articles of <b>the</b> <b>treaty</b> that addressed commercial and navigation matters expired after 12 years. When the Federal Republic of Central America formally {{ceased to exist}} in 1847, <b>the</b> <b>treaty</b> lost its legal force.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Treaty</b> {{superseded}} <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Darin (1915).|$|R
5|$|Despite this, the European Economic Community and Euratom were {{established}} in 1958 by <b>the</b> <b>Treaties</b> of Rome. The Common Assembly was shared by all three communities (which had separate executives) and it renamed itself the European Parliamentary Assembly. The first meeting was held on 19 March 1958 having been set up in Luxembourg, it elected Schuman as its president and on 13 May it rearranged itself to sit according to political ideology rather than nationality. This {{is seen as the}} birth of the modern European Parliament, with Parliament's 50 years celebrations being held in March 2008 rather than 2002.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, {{the seat}} of the European Parliament remains controversial. The work of Parliament is divided between Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, which is seen as a problem due to the large number of MEPs, staff, and {{documents}} which need to be moved. As the locations of the major seats have been enshrined in <b>the</b> <b>treaties</b> of the European Union, Parliament has no right to decide its own seat, unlike other national parliaments.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, Alsace {{was one of}} {{the main}} battlefields of the Thirty Years War. Sélestat was seized by the Swedes in 1632 after a month-long siege. They {{surrendered}} the town to their French allies two years later. The local population long remained predominantly faithful to the House of Habsburg. The Peace of Westphalia (1648) formalised the annexation of the Decapolis by France. Sélestat was briefly occupied by the Germans during the Franco-Dutch War in 1674. <b>The</b> <b>Treaties</b> of Nijmegen (1679) that ended the war also abolished the Decapolis.|$|E
25|$|These {{changes were}} {{recognized}} in, but not caused by, <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Versailles. They were subsequently further elaborated in <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Saint-Germain and <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Trianon.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Treaty</b> {{was agreed}} {{three years after}} the Battle of Largs in 1263. Michael Lynch has {{compared}} <b>the</b> <b>treaty's</b> importance with that of <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of York of 1237. <b>The</b> <b>Treaty</b> of York defined a border between Scotland and England which is almost identical to the modern border.|$|R
50|$|In 1919, Romania's {{territorial}} cessions to Germany were renounced in <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Versailles. Romania's cessions to Austria-Hungary were renounced in <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Saint-Germain in 1919 and <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Trianon in 1920, {{while the}} cessions to Bulgaria were renounced in <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Neuilly in 1919.|$|R
5|$|Edwards' actions alienated those Native Americans {{friendly}} to the U.S. in the region. Ninian Edwards, having lost {{the confidence of the}} Madison administration, waited out the war in Kentucky. However, he was reappointed to a second and then a third term as territorial governor in 1812 and 1815, and he was also named one of the three U.S. negotiators of <b>the</b> <b>Treaties</b> of Portage des Sioux in 1815.|$|E
5|$|Grant's {{success with}} Britain was {{undermined}} by {{his attempt to}} annex the Dominican Republic, an independent nation unable to pay its debt. Many Americans believed a Caribbean naval base would establish naval dominance and be useful in protecting shipping from piracy in a potential isthmian canal. Anti-imperialist Republicans had previously rejected a Johnson administration treaty to establish a Samaná Bay naval base. Grant took interest in Dominican annexation and sent his secretary, Orville E. Babcock, there to consult with Buenaventura Báez, the pro-annexation Dominican president. Babcock returned in September 1869 with a draft treaty of annexation, although Fish had not given him any diplomatic authority. Given such authority by Fish, Babcock visited the island nation a second time making a treaty for Dominican annexation and the lease of Samaná Bay. The cabinet discussed <b>the</b> <b>treaties</b> at a meeting on December 21. Fish dismissed annexation, seeing the island as politically unstable. Grant supported it, believing acquisition of the majority-black nation would increase commerce, create a refuge for African Americans, and help to exploit the island's natural resources. He lobbied Sumner in hopes of influencing him to help with passage of <b>the</b> <b>treaties.</b> Fish added to the effort out of loyalty to Grant, but to no avail; Sumner was set against annexation and on June 30, 1870, the Senate rejected <b>the</b> <b>treaties.</b> A congressional investigation headed by Senator Carl Schurz revealed speculators had promoted the treaties' passage. Unwilling to admit defeat, Grant convinced Congress to send a commission to investigate. Although the commission approved Grant's call for annexation in its findings, the Senate remained opposed and Grant was forced to abandon further efforts. Grant retaliated by firing Sumner's friend and Minister to Great Britain, John Lothrop Motley, while he pressured the Senate to depose Sumner of his chairmanship.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 <b>the</b> <b>Treaties</b> of Rome {{established}} two, similar, communities {{creating a}} common market (European Economic Community) and promoting atomic energy co-operation (Euratom). The three institutions shared the Court of Justice and the Parliament, however {{they had a}} separate Council and High Authority, which was called the Commission in these Communities. The {{reason for this is}} the different relationship between the Commission and Council. At the time the French government was suspicious of the supranationalism and wanted to limit the powers of the High Authority in the new Communities, giving the Council a greater role in checking the executive.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Alexandropol (December 2, 1920) was <b>the</b> first <b>treaty</b> {{signed by}} <b>the</b> Turkish revolutionaries. It nullified the Armenian {{activities}} on the eastern border, which was reflected in <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Sèvres as a succession of regions named Wilsonian Armenia. The 10th item in <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Alexandropol stated that Armenia renounced <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Sèvres, which stipulated Wilsonian Armenia.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Rome, <b>the</b> {{original}} {{full name}} {{of which was}} <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> establishing <b>the</b> European Economic Community has been amended by successive treaties significantly changing its content. <b>The</b> 1992 <b>Treaty</b> of Maastricht established the European Union, the EEC becoming one of its three pillars, the European Community. Hence, <b>the</b> <b>treaty</b> was renamed <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> establishing <b>the</b> European Community (TEC).|$|R
2500|$|The realities on the ground, however, were different. This {{idea was}} blocked in both <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Alexandropol and <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Kars. <b>The</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Sèvres was {{superseded}} by <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Lausanne, {{and the fight}} for the [...] "Administration for Western Armenia" [...] was dropped from the table.|$|R
