They carry the risk of eroding penile tissue (breaking through the skin). Although satisfaction among men who use them is high, if <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> to be removed implants make other methods such as injections and vacuum devices unusable due to tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>need</b> to be incredibly maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and {{be capable of}} escaping larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their maneuverability, from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by high lift and thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three times their weight and horizontal thrust forces up to five times their weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, and {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages – just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism does not mean they are less able fliers; they are, in certain ways, more agile than anything that has evolved afterward.|$|E
500|$|Spiderlings hatch {{from their}} eggs after about 8 days and can {{emerge from the}} egg sac as early as 11 days after being laid, {{although}} cooler temperatures can significantly slow their development so that emergence does not occur for months. After hatching they spend about a week inside the egg sac, feeding on the yolk and molting once. [...] Baby spiders appear from September to January (spring to early summer). Male spiders mature through five instars in about 45–90 days. Females mature through seven–eight instars in about 75–120 days. Males live {{for up to six}} or seven months, while females may live between two and three years. Laboratory tests have shown that redbacks may survive for an average of 100 days, and sometimes over 300 days without any food, those starved at 10°C faring better than those kept without food at 25°C. Spiders are known to reduce their metabolic rates in response to starvation, and can distend their abdomens to store large amounts of food. Redbacks can survive temperatures from below freezing point to 40°C, though <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> relatively warm summers, with temperatures of 15 to 25°C for two to three months, to survive and breed.|$|E

2500|$|The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog {{is happy}} with an {{enthusiastic}} nature and strong affinity to people and children.

The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is confident in nature; the breed is gentle with children. They can be stubborn and determined. The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is an intelligent breed and is a quick learner. They can be difficult to housebreak, taking up to 6 months or more; and tend to try to eat just about anything, edible or not.|$|E

60|$|We observe finally, that Count Mirabeau has {{actually}} arrived. He descends from Berlin, {{on the scene}} of action; glares into it with flashing sun-glance; discerns that it will do nothing for him. He had hoped these Notables might need a Secretary. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> one; but have fixed on Dupont de Nemours; a man of smaller fame, but then of better;--who indeed, as his friends often hear, labours under this complaint, surely not a universal one, of having 'five kings to correspond with.' (Dumont, Souvenirs sur Mirabeau (Paris, 1832), p. 20.) The pen of a Mirabeau cannot become an official one; nevertheless it remains a pen. In defect of Secretaryship, he sets to denouncing Stock-brokerage (Denonciation de l'Agiotage); testifying, as his wont is, by loud bruit, that he is present and busy;--till, warned by friend Talleyrand, and even by Calonne himself underhand, that 'a seventeenth Lettre-de-Cachet may be launched against him,' he timefully flits over the marches.|$|E
