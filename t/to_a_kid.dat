500|$|... "Beside You", {{the second}} {{song on the}} album, has been {{described}} as [...] "expressionistic poetry and a scattershot collection of images and scenarios". [...] It begins with the classical guitar of Jay Berliner and Morrison's voice circling each other. Morrison described it as [...] "the kind of song that you'd sing <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> or somebody that you love. [...] It's basically a love song. It's just a song about being spiritually beside somebody." [...] It was originally recorded for Bang Records in December 1967. That first recording shows the pop music intentions of Bert Berns which give it a different sound from the Astral Weeks recording.|$|E
500|$|Chuck E. Cheese’s Pizza Time Theatre {{was founded}} by Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, who was seeking to expand the purview of video game arcades beyond more adult {{locations}} like pool halls <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> and family friendly venue. Bushnell’s experience in the amusement park industry, {{as well as his}} fondness of The Walt Disney Company, was influential in the conceptualization of the Pizza Time Theatre concept. The first location opened in San Jose, California in 1977, and was labeled as the first family restaurant to integrate food, cheap animated entertainment, and an indoor arcade. In 1978, Bushnell purchased the Pizza Time Theatre concept from Atari's then-corporate parent, Warner Communications. Gene Landrum then resigned from Atari and was made President and Chief Operating Officer of Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre.|$|E

500|$|The Nightfly was {{met with}} almost universally {{positive}} reviews. Billboard labeled it their top album pick {{in the first month}} of its release, calling it a [...] "stunning debut" [...] and praising its [...] "typically blue chip crew of crack players and crisp digital production." [...] David Fricke wrote in Rolling Stone that [...] "Donald Fagen conjures a world where all things are possible, even <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> locked in his bedroom." [...] Robert Christgau, writing for The Village Voice, gave the album an A and commented, [...] "these songs are among Fagen's finest [...] his acutely shaded lyrics puts the jazziest music he's ever committed to vinyl into a context that like everything here is loving but very clear-eyed." [...] Robert Palmer of The New York Times called The Nightfly a [...] "vivid and frequently ingenious look back at a world that is gone forever. Its sound is glossy and contemporary, but references to both the spirit and the music of the years when Mr. Fagen was growing up can be found in almost every song." ...|$|E
500|$|The Satanic Bible {{has also}} {{received}} {{a large amount of}} criticism from people and organizations who find its content to be dangerous. Much of this criticism came during the period of [...] "Satanic panic," [...] when Satanic ritual abuse was feared to be epidemic. Much of this media coverage, however, has been denounced as [...] "uncritical and sensationalized." [...] Tom Harpur condemns the book as [...] "blasphemous" [...] and [...] "socially seditious," [...] and blames it for causing an increase in gruesome violence, ritual abuse, and other obscene acts. Critics have also accused The Satanic Bible of encouraging violence and murder, particularly in young people considered to be impressionable. Dawn Perlmutter criticizes it for providing adolescents with bad messages and messages that can be easily misinterpreted. Possession of The Satanic Bible has been used by some studies to identify adolescents who are antisocial, and some warn that possession of the book is a warning sign of emotional issues. The Council on Mind Abuse took a very negative view of The Satanic Bible. Former Executive Director Rob Tucker warned parents to look for The Satanic Bible in their children's bedrooms, saying, [...] "You have to help the child fight this obsession like any other addiction" [...] and [...] "It's like giving drugs <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> who is already on the edge." [...] Attempts to ban the book from schools and public libraries have been made in various places around the world, and bans or limitations on the book in prisons have been repeatedly challenged in court. However, opposition to The Satanic Bible has rarely led to its removal; these bans are rare. The book was banned in South Africa from 1973 to 1993.|$|E

Bertschy also criticizes the character design of {{the girls in the}} show as [...] "ridiculously-endowed heroines" [...] with [...] "cartoon bombshell bodies" [...] that are [...] "tiresome and feels like it was written by a 13-year old." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tropical Gangsters is {{the third}} album by Kid Creole and the Coconuts, {{released}} on May 10, 1982. Originally conceived as a solo album by band leader August Darnell and titled Wise Guy, his label ZE Records pressured him to change it <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Kid</b> Creole and the Coconuts record {{and to make it}} more commercial sounding in order to relieve the label's financial problems. Despite the tensions this caused within the band and Darnell's complaint that the subsequent record was a [...] "cop-out", the more dance-pop oriented sound helped it reached #145 in the Billboard 200 album chart, representing the group's commercial breakthrough in their home country (the album kept the title of Wise Guy in the US and Canada, with a different cover). However, to the surprise of Darnell and his record company Tropical Gangsters was a huge success in Australia and New Zealand, Europe, and in particular the UK, where the album peaked at #3 in the UK albums chart and yielded three top ten singles. Tropical Gangsters made Darnell a worldwide star, and the album remains both his and the ZE label's most successful record by far.|$|E

6000|$|MY DEAR PEOPLE,--A week in Paris reduced {{me to the}} {{limpness}} {{and lack}} of appetite peculiar <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> glove, and gave Fanny a jumping sore throat. It's my belief there is death in the kettle there; a pestilence or the like. We came out here, pitched on the Star and Garter (they call it Somebody's pavilion), found the place a bed of lilacs and nightingales (first time I ever heard one), and also of a bird called the piasseur, cheerfulest of sylvan creatures, an ideal comic opera in itself. [...] "Come along, what fun, here's Pan in the next glade at picnic, and this-yer's Arcadia, and it's awful fun, and I've had a glass, I will not deny, but not to see it on me," [...] that is his meaning as near as I can gather. Well, the place (forest of beeches all new-fledged, grass like velvet, fleets of hyacinth) pleased us and did us good. We tried all ways to find a cheaper place, but could find nothing safe; cold, damp, brick-floored rooms and sich; we could not leave Paris till your seven days' sight on draft expired; we dared {{not go back to}} be miasmatised in these homes of putridity; so here we are till Tuesday in the Star and Garter. My throat is quite cured, appetite and strength on the mend. Fanny seems also picking up.|$|E
