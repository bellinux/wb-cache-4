5|$|I {{realized}} {{that for a}} long <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion... But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E
25|$|I didn't {{have the}} luxury - and I {{consider}} it a luxury - of being a protester because my focus was concentrated on getting information. I knew I wasn't {{going to be in}} that position for very long. I wanted to participate in gathering whatever information I could in the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had,</b> and I wanted to bring it all together, really to see what would happen. I needed time to work by myself.|$|E
25|$|Why did {{the date}} of Benjamin Britten's death – 4 December 1976 – touch such a chord in me? During this time I was {{obviously}} {{at the point where}} I could recognise the magnitude of such a loss. Inexplicable feelings of guilt, more than that even, arose in me. I had just discovered Britten for myself. Just before his death I began to appreciate the unusual purity of his music – I had had the impression of the same kind of purity in the ballads of Guillaume de Machaut. And besides, for a long <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> wanted to meet Britten personally – and now it would not come to that.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I really can't say,' replied Eugene, {{shaking his}} head blankly, after pausing again to reconsider. 'At <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> thought yes; at other <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> thought no. Now, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been {{inclined}} to pursue such a subject; now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{felt that it was}} absurd, and that it tired and embarrassed me. Absolutely, I can't say. Frankly and faithfully, I would if I could.' ...|$|R
25|$|If I {{knew what}} I know now I {{probably}} would have switched. At the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> already been playing two or three years, {{and it seemed like}} I had been playing a long time. I thought I’d never be able to change the way I played. The reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E
500|$|Balfour met Weizmann at the Foreign Office on 22 March 1917; {{two days}} later, Weizmann {{described}} the meeting as being [...] "the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a real business talk with him". Weizmann explained {{at the meeting}} that the Zionists had a preference for a British protectorate over Palestine, {{as opposed to an}} American, French or international arrangement; Balfour agreed, but warned that [...] "there may be difficulties with France and Italy".|$|E
500|$|Reflections from {{athletes and}} {{officials}} provide {{an insight into}} {{the value of this}} inaugural event. Bill Mather-Brown, an Australian athlete, said [...] "The 1962 Games was the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been asked for an autograph. We regarded it as a compliment. We were mobbed, especially at the swimming pool. Sometimes we [...] were not sure people really wanted our signature or were just being polite and wanted us to feel good".|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{say another}} word I’ll knock yer ugly little head off!" [...] said Dick wrathfully. [...] "If I hadn’t been modest <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> come home by daylight. Oh, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a <b>time!</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had a time!" ...|$|R

500|$|Peeler {{resumed his}} duties as {{custodian}} of the Shrine of Remembrance on his discharge, guiding visitors around the memorial. In the 1961 Queen's Birthday Honours, his [...] "long and dedicated service" [...] at the Shrine was recognised with the award of the British Empire Medal. He retired {{three years later}} {{at the age of}} 76, stating: [...] "It's <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a rest." [...] In 1966, Peeler was interviewed for a newspaper article; when queried on his Victoria Cross exploit, he recalled: ...|$|E
500|$|Gittings {{appeared}} in the documentary films Gay Pioneers, Before Stonewall, After Stonewall, Out of the Past, and Pride Divide. In 1991 she remembered her decisions to be as open as she was throughout her life when she said, [...] "Every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{to make a decision}} to put myself forward or to stay back, to use my real name or not, to go on television or decline, to get out on some of the earliest picket lines or remain behind. I usually took the public position because there weren't many of us yet that could afford the risk." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{the release}} {{date for the}} film had been pre-determined and filming had {{finished}} close to that date, John Barry received some edits directly from the cutting-room floor, {{rather than as a}} finished edit, and scored some sequences from the rough initial prints. Barry described his work in Goldfinger as a favourite of his, saying it was [...] "the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> complete control, writing the score and the song". The musical tracks, in keeping with the film's theme of gold and metal, make heavy use of brass, and also metallic chimes. The film's score is described as [...] "brassy and raunchy" [...] with [...] "a sassy sexiness to it".|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{for once}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had good luck. Hitherto <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always {{come out of}} a fight more or less damaged; this <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> escaped without a scratch." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "For {{a supply}} to my necessities, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> reigned {{eighteen}} years, [...] in which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> peace, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> received far less supply [...] than hath {{been given to}} any king since the Conquest. The last [...] queen had, one year with another, above a hundred thousand pounds [...] per annum in subsidies; and in all my <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had but four [...] subsidies and six fifteens[B]. It is ten years since <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a [...] subsidy, in all which <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been sparing to trouble you. <b>I</b> [...] <b>have</b> turned myself as nearly to save expenses as <b>I</b> may. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> [...] abated much in my household expenses, in my navies, and the [...] charge of my munition." ...|$|R
500|$|After {{defeating}} Nikolay Davydenko at Wimbledon 2012, Murray pointed upwards {{with both}} hands and wagged them back and forth while looking to the sky. Murray declined to reveal the reason, and ever since, he has continued to celebrate his victories with this gesture. Murray marked his first Wimbledon title in 2013 with the same victory salute. Then in his book 'Seventy-Seven; My Path to Wimbledon Glory', released in November 2013, Murray said: “The real reason is that around that <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a few friends and family who had various issues affecting them [...] [...] [...] I knew that they would be watching and I wanted to let them know I was thinking of them.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{challenge}} of coordinating these projects took an artistic toll on Pei. He found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising {{the plans for}} them. As a result, he felt disconnected from the actual creative work. [...] "Design is {{something you have to}} put your hand to," [...] he said. [...] "While my people had the luxury of doing one job at a <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{to keep track of the}} whole enterprise." [...] Pei's dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing Zeckendorf's firm. I.M. Pei and Associates officially broke from Webb and Knapp in 1960, which benefited Pei creatively but pained him personally. He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways.|$|E
500|$|Angus Young later recalled, [...] "I {{remember}} the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever heard Brian's (Johnson) name was from Bon. Bon had mentioned {{that he had been}} in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said 'Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard.' And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we said we should see if we can find him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am {{indeed a}} {{stranger}} here; at least <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not {{been at the}} post {{for a very long}} <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> just reached {{the end of a long}} voyage." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{the second}} season episode [...] "The One With The Lesbian Wedding", Rachel {{references}} the popularity of her haircut when she complains that her own overbearing mother is trying to reinvent her life after hers, lamenting, [...] "Couldn't she just copy my haircut?" [...] Despite her association with the cut, Aniston disliked the hairstyle. She found maintaining the hairstyle without McMillan's help difficult, stating [...] "I'd curse Chris every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to blowdry. It took three brushes—it was like doing surgery!" [...] {{and that she would}} rather shave her head than have to wear {{it for the rest of}} her life. Since Aniston, several other celebrities have worn variations of the [...] "Rachel", among them actresses Cameron Diaz, Rachel McAdams, Emma Watson, Reese Witherspoon, Julia Roberts, comedian Tina Fey, model Tyra Banks, and singer Lily Allen.|$|E
500|$|Various {{accounts}} of Hubbard's {{service in the}} North Atlantic have been put forward by the Church of Scientology and Hubbard himself. The Church of Scientology states in one publication that Hubbard [...] "took command of an antisubmarine escort vessel with Atlantic convoys". In a 1954 lecture, Hubbard asserted {{that he had been}} sent [...] "to Boston in the very early part of the war to take command of a corvette" [...] and had been given a crew made up of convicts from the Portsmouth Naval Prison. Hubbard stated in another lecture that he had been posted aboard [...] "corvettes, North Atlantic. And I went on fighting submarines in the North Atlantic and doing other things and so on. And I finally got a set of orders for the ship. By that <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the squadron." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band played}} its first gig in May 1967, and had its first major break at the 7th National Jazz and Blues Festival in Windsor on 13 August. Oldham {{had managed to}} secure a {{separate}} set for the group in a side tent away from also accompanying Arnold on the main stage, where they gained attention. The next week, Welch wrote in the Melody Maker that [...] "it was the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen a group actually {{in the act of}} winning its first following in quite dramatic circumstances". When Arnold went back to her family in the US shortly afterwards, Oldham offered the group a contract of their own. Hague was not interested in the [...] "progressive" [...] direction the group wanted to go in, so he was replaced by former Mark Leeman Five and Habits drummer Brian Davison.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Blake {{answered}} quietly, [...] "we'll {{go on as}} long as we are able. Though <b>I</b> haven't <b>had</b> a rosy <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{faith in}} my luck." ...|$|R

500|$|Following the match, referee Nicolae Rainea {{explained}} {{his decision to}} play the match despite heavy fog: [...] "When I went out there before kick-off I decided I could see well enough and so I decided to play. I am afraid many spectators would not get a very clear view {{but there was no}} <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> any thoughts of abandoning the game." [...] Liverpool manager Bob Paisley was critical of the decision to play the match: [...] "You can't play football in conditions like that, it's ridiculous." [...] Paisley suggested the competition should be played in April when the weather was better: [...] "I think a match like this, between two leading team should be played in better weather, say in April. I know it's difficult, but it's farcical when good players like these have to slither about in fog and can't see each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Milk drifted from California to Texas to New York, {{without a}} steady job or plan. In New York City he became {{involved}} with O'Horgan's theater company as a [...] "general aide", signing on as associate producer for Lenny and for Eve Merriam's Inner City. The time he had spent with the cast of flower children wore away much of Milk's conservatism. A contemporary New York Times story about O'Horgan described Milk as [...] "a sad eyed man—another aging hippie with long, long hair, wearing faded jeans and pretty beads". Craig Rodwell read {{the description of the}} formerly uptight man and wondered if it could be the same person. One of Milk's Wall Street friends worried that he seemed to have no plan or future, but remembered Milk's attitude: [...] "I think he was happier than at any <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever seen him in his entire life." ...|$|E
500|$|Carey {{confessed that}} she never tried to change the {{situation}} because [...] " [...] used to be insecure and cautious, and so [...] would {{listen to what the}} people said." [...] However, the control Mottola exerted over her career soon [...] "spilled into her personal life" [...] once they were married, increasing the amount of conflict between the two. Soon, it was obvious that their marriage was in shambles; as stated in a Vanity Fair article, [...] "the couple began to argue {{at the drop of a}} hat." [...] Carey was very involved in the project, more so than she had ever been on an album. [...] "I went into this phase of recording, recording, recording and doing it really fast," [...] she told Time. [...] "This <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> more time, and I focused more on what I wanted to do." [...] As Carey's career and work continued to reflect her views on how it should sound, her marriage to Mottola continued to [...] "deteriorate".|$|E
6000|$|Again Madame Munster hesitated. [...] "They should hate me! It 's {{a measure}} of the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been losing here that they don't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I, Mademoiselle?--impossible! Five <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> crossed {{him this}} day. Madame must really hire a gendarme for this service. Ouf! Je n'en puis plus!" ...|$|R
