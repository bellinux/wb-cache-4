5|$|Acid <b>Tongue</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} studio album by American singer-songwriter Jenny Lewis, {{released}} in September 2008 (see 2008 in music) through Warner Bros. and Rough Trade Records. Inspired by jam sessions, {{the album was}} recorded in January 2008 in Van Nuys, California {{with the intent of}} capturing a more live feeling than 2006's Rabbit Fur Coat. Lewis worked with a number of guest musicians and wrote the album with boyfriend Johnathan Rice. Lewis, Rice, Jason Lader, and Dave Scher produced the album. Acid Tongue features musical styles ranging from indie rock to alternative country and Americana.|$|E
5|$|Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve {{release of}} air {{flow through the}} nasal cavity, and these are called nasals or nasalized sounds. Other sounds are defined {{by the way the}} tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called laterals, because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called rhotics) that are {{characterized}} by how the <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> positioned relative to the air stream.|$|E
50|$|Much of what {{is known}} about this gift was {{recorded}} by St. Paul in 1 Corinthians 14. In this passage, guidelines for the proper use of the gift of <b>tongues</b> <b>were</b> given. In order for the gift of <b>tongues</b> to <b>be</b> beneficial the edification of the church, such supernatural utterances were to be interpreted into the language of the gathered Christians. If no one among the gathered Christians possessed the gift of interpretation, then the gift of <b>tongues</b> <b>was</b> not to be publicly exercised.

5|$|The {{rootlets}} of the {{hypoglossal nerve}} {{arise from the}} hypoglossal nucleus {{near the bottom of}} the brain stem. The hypoglossal nucleus receives input from both the motor cortices but the contralateral input is dominant; innervation of the <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> essentially lateralized. Signals from muscle spindles on the tongue travel through the hypoglossal nerve, moving onto the lingual nerve which synapses on the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|At metamorphosis, {{rapid changes}} in the body take place as the {{lifestyle}} of the frog changes completely. The spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut. The animal develops a large jaw, and its gills disappear along with its gill sac. Eyes and legs grow quickly, and a <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> formed. There are associated {{changes in the}} neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system. All this can happen in about a day. A few days later, the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place.|$|E
5|$|In {{all human}} {{cultures}} premastication/kiss-feeding or kissing {{between mother and}} infant has been observed in all with kissing {{believed to be a}} socially ritualized form of feeding premasticated food. There is high similarity in the execution of kiss-feeding and human kisses (e.g. French kiss); in the former, the <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> used to push food from mother to child with the child receiving both the mother's food and tongue in sucking movements, and the latter simply forgoes the premasticated food. In fact, observations across various species and cultures confirms that the act of kissing and premastication have most likely evolved from the similar relationship-based feeding behaviours.|$|E

5|$|Legends {{of female}} vampire-like beings who can detach {{parts of their}} upper body occur in the Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia and Indonesia. There are two main vampire-like creatures in the Philippines: the Tagalog Mandurugo ("blood-sucker") and the Visayan manananggal ("self-segmenter"). The mandurugo is a variety of the aswang that {{takes the form of}} an {{attractive}} girl by day, and develops wings and a long, hollow, thread-like tongue by night. They use an elongated proboscis-like tongue to suck fetuses off pregnant women. They also prefer to eat entrails (specifically the heart and the liver) and the phlegm of sick people. The manananggal is described as being an older, beautiful woman capable of severing its upper torso in order to fly into the night with huge bat-like wings and prey on unsuspecting, sleeping pregnant women in their homes. The <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> used to suck up blood from a sleeping victim.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis in {{the mouth}} is very rare, in {{contrast}} to lichen planus, another common papulosquamous disorder that commonly involves both the skin and mouth. When psoriasis involves the oral mucosa (the lining of the mouth), it may be asymptomatic, but it may appear as white or grey-yellow plaques. Fissured <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> the most common finding in those with oral psoriasis and {{has been reported to}} occur in 6.5–20% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin. The microscopic appearance of oral mucosa affected by geographic tongue (migratory stomatitis) is very similar to the appearance of psoriasis. However, modern studies have failed to demonstrate any link between the two conditions.|$|E
5|$|The distant {{vision of}} a frog is better than its near vision. Calling frogs will quickly become silent when they see an {{intruder}} or even a moving shadow but the closer an object is, the less well it is seen. When a frog shoots out its tongue to catch an insect it is reacting to a small moving object that it cannot see well and must line it up precisely beforehand because it shuts its eyes as the <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> extended. Whether a frog sees in colour is debatable {{but it has been}} shown that it responds positively to blue light, perhaps because that colour is associated with bodies of water that can provide refuge when the frog feels threatened.|$|E

5|$|Although it locates food by vision, {{the role}} smell has {{in how it}} {{specifically}} finds carrion has been debated. Consensus has been {{that it does not}} detect odours, and instead follows the smaller turkey and greater yellow-headed vultures, which do have a sense of smell, to a carcass, but a 1991 study demonstrated that the king vulture could find carrion in the forest without the aid of other vultures, suggesting that it locates food using an olfactory sense. The king vulture primarily eats carrion found in the forest, though it is known to venture onto nearby savannas in search of food. Once it has found a carcass, the king vulture displaces the other vultures because of its large size and strong bill. However, when it is at the same kill as the larger Andean condor, the king vulture always defers to it. Using its bill to tear, it makes the initial cut in a fresh carcass. This allows the smaller, weaker-beaked vultures, which can not open the hide of a carcass, access to the carcass after the king vulture has fed. The vulture’s <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> rasp-like, which allows it to pull flesh off of the carcass’s bones. Generally, it only eats the skin and harder parts of the tissue of its meal. The king vulture has also been recorded eating fallen fruit of the moriche palm when carrion is scarce in Bolívar state, Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{broken and}} {{incoherent}} radio messages between Lieber {{and the search}} party are intercepted by intelligence agents tracking their progress, and rumours begin to spread across the world of Hitler's capture. Debates flare up over his impending trial, {{where it will be}} held and under whose jurisdiction. Orosso is identified as the nearest airfield to the last known location of the search party, and aircraft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town. But when the search party loses radio contact with Lieber, they must make a decision to either wait out the storms and deliver their captive to Lieber later, or try Hitler in the jungle. They choose the latter, given that they would likely lose control of the situation if they attempted to transport their prisoner. Against Lieber's advice ("You must not let him speak... his <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> like no other") they prepare for a trial with a judge, prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members of the search party. Teku, a local Indian tracker, is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness.|$|E

25|$|The <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> {{skeletal}} muscle {{on the floor}} of the mouth that manipulates food for chewing (mastication) and swallowing (deglutition).

25|$|The <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} accessory organ in the digestive system.

Forty-six participants recited 20 vowel-consonant-vowel (VCV) combinations and swallowed 10 ccs of water.

Phonemic differentiation in vertical <b>tongue</b> motions <b>was</b> observed as coupling varied predictably across pellet pairs with place of articulation. Moreover, tongue displacements for speech and swallowing clustered into distinct groups based on their coupling profiles.
