500|$|According to Vanderbilt's All-Southern halfback and 1924 captain-elect Gil Reese, [...] "He {{would never}} let them jump on me. Whenever anyone would {{threaten}} me, Bomar was always right <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'Keep your hands off that boy'. They always did, too. Bomar always looked after me, and he always called back to me when we started on end runs. No one could run interference like Bomar." [...] Bomar and Reese were on an all-time Vanderbilt team in the school's 1934 yearbook, and Bomar was chosen for an Associated Press Southeast Area all-time football team for the era from 1920 to 1969.|$|E
500|$|In 1952, King George VI died, {{the third}} of Queen Mary's {{children}} to predecease her; her eldest granddaughter, Princess Elizabeth, ascended the throne as Queen Elizabeth II. The death of a third child profoundly affected her. Mary remarked to Princess Marie Louise: [...] "I have lost three sons through death, but I have never been privileged to be <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a last farewell to them." [...] Mary died the next year on 24 March 1953 {{at the age of}} 85, only ten weeks before her granddaughter's coronation. Mary let it be known that, in the event of her death, the coronation was not to be postponed. Her remains lay in state at Westminster Hall, where large numbers of mourners filed past her coffin. She is buried beside her husband in the nave of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.|$|E
500|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{has decided}} to boycott the Steamtown Mall after a shop owner refuses to serve him, {{going so far as}} to cancel orders to {{businesses}} there. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and the rest of the office convince Dwight to get revenge on the shop owner by making Dwight appear to be high-class, and then having him refuse to buy from the shop, a scheme the office references from the movie Pretty Woman. Using tips from the rest of the office to make himself appear more sophisticated, Dwight, with Jim and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), return to the shop. To their surprise, the shop owner immediately recognizes Dwight even in his new attire, and explains that they did not serve him before because they were intimidated by his blood-soaked hands (actually beet juice). Dwight, somewhat flustered from the truth of the situation being revealed to him, stumbles over his words before finally saying the line he had come all the way <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "You made a big mistake. Huge!", while waving his shopping bags. The group leaves somewhat embarrassed, but not before Dwight buys what he came for: a pewter wizard statuette holding a crystal ball.|$|E

The much-anticipated closer had everyone {{waiting to see}} if Tony was finally going to go from whacker to whackee. Instead, they got Journey, a greasy plate of onion rings and a black screen.

2500|$|David Mavorah, {{a curator}} of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, {{points out that the}} names on the ossuaries were {{extremely}} common. [...] "We know that Joseph, Jesus and Mariamne were all among the most common names of the period. To start with all these names being together in a single tomb and leap from <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this is the tomb of Jesus is a little far-fetched, to put it politely." [...] David Mavorah is an expert of Israeli Antiquity, and (presumably) not an expert of statistics. However, Dr. Andrey Feuerverger, the statistician cited by the makers of the documentary, has said that determination of the identity of those in the tomb was the purview of biblical historians, and not statisticians. For another interpretation of the statistics see the statistics section above.|$|E
