50|$|The terms true {{and false}} rib {{describe}} rib pairs that are {{directly or indirectly}} attached to the sternum. The phrase <b>true</b> <b>rib</b> (costae verae), or fixed rib, refers to the first seven, or vertebrosternal, rib pairs. The phrase false rib (costae spuriae), or vertebrochondral ribs refers to the eighth-to-twelfth pairs of ribs. The eighth-to-tenth pairs of ribs connect to the sternum indirectly via the costal cartilages of the ribs above them. Their elasticity allows ribcage movement for respiratory activity.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{chicken breast}} cuts and {{processed}} chicken breast products include the moniker [...] "with rib meat". This is a misnomer, {{as it is}} the small piece of white meat that overlays the scapula, and is removed with the breast meat. The breast is cut from the chicken and sold as a solid cut, while the leftover breast and <b>true</b> <b>rib</b> meat is stripped from the bone through mechanical separation for use in chicken franks, for example. Breast meat is often sliced thinly and marketed as chicken slices, an easy filling for sandwiches. Often, the tenderloin (pectoralis minor) is marketed separately from the breast (pectoralis major). In the US, [...] "tenders" [...] can be either tenderloins or strips cut from the breast. In the UK the strips of pectoralis minor are called [...] "chicken mini-fillets".|$|E
50|$|The second rib is {{the second}} {{uppermost}} rib in humans or second most frontal in animals that walk on four limbs. In humans the second rib {{is defined as a}} <b>true</b> <b>rib</b> since it connects with the sternum through the intervention of the costal cartilage anteriorly (at the front). Posteriorly, the second rib is connected with the vertebral column by the second thoracic vertebra. The second rib is much longer than the first rib, but has a very similar curvature. The non-articular portion of the tubercle is occasionally only feebly marked. The angle is slight, and situated close to the tubercle. The body is not twisted, so that both ends touch any plane surface upon which it may be laid; but there is a bend, with its convexity upward, similar to, though smaller than that found in the first rib. The body is not flattened horizontally like that of the first rib. Its external surface is convex, and looks upward and a little outward; near the middle of it is a rough eminence for the origin of {{the lower part of the}} first and the whole of the second digitation of the serratus anterior; behind and above this is attached the posterior scalene. The internal surface, smooth, and concave, is directed downward and a little inward: on its posterior part there is a short costal groove between the ridge of the internal surface of the rib and the inferior border. It contains the intercostal veins and arteries and intercostal nerve.|$|E

6000|$|The {{number of}} ribs varies in many animals. Mr. St. George Mivart says: [...] "In the highest {{forms of the}} Primates, the number of <b>true</b> <b>ribs</b> is seven, but in Hylobates there are {{sometimes}} eight pairs. In Semnopithecus and Colobus there are generally seven, but sometimes eight pairs of <b>true</b> <b>ribs.</b> In the Cebidae there are generally seven or eight pairs, but in Ateles sometimes nine" [...] (Proc. Zool. Soc., 1865, p. 568). In the same paper it is stated {{that the number of}} dorsal vertebrae in man is normally twelve, very rarely thirteen.

5000|$|It arises {{on either}} side from the lower third of the {{posterior}} {{surface of the body}} of the sternum, from the posterior surface of the xiphoid process, and from the sternal ends of the costal cartilages of the lower three or four <b>true</b> <b>ribs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{sternocostal joints}} {{also known as}} sternochondral joints (or costosternal articulations), are {{synovial}} plane joints of the cartilages of the <b>true</b> <b>ribs</b> with the sternum, {{with the exception of}} the first, which is a synarthrosis since the cartilage is directly united with the sternum.

50|$|From this {{extensive}} origin {{the fibers}} converge toward their insertion; those {{arising from the}} clavicle pass obliquely downward and outwards (laterally), and are usually separated from the rest by a slight interval; those from {{the lower part of}} the sternum, and the cartilages of the lower <b>true</b> <b>ribs,</b> run upward and laterally, while the middle fibers pass horizontally.|$|R
50|$|It {{arises from}} the {{anterior}} surface of the sternal half of the clavicle; from breadth of the half of the anterior surface of the sternum, as low down as the attachment of the cartilage of the sixth or seventh rib; from the cartilages of all the <b>true</b> <b>ribs,</b> with the exception, frequently, of the first or seventh and from the aponeurosis of the abdominal external oblique muscle.|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} {{intercostal muscles}} (intercostales interni) are {{a group of}} skeletal muscles located between the ribs. They are eleven in number on either side. They commence anteriorly at the sternum, in the intercostal spaces between the cartilages of the <b>true</b> <b>ribs,</b> and at the anterior extremities of the cartilages of the false ribs, and extend backward {{as far as the}} angles of the ribs, hence they are continued to the vertebral column by thin aponeuroses, the posterior intercostal membranes.|$|R

50|$|In birds, ribs {{are present}} as {{distinct}} bones {{only on the}} thoracic region, although small fused ribs are present on the cervical vertebrae.

The inferior angle has a small facet, which, with a corresponding one on the xiphoid process, forms a notch for the cartilage of the seventh rib. These articular depressions are separated {{by a series of}} curved interarticular intervals, which diminish in length from above downward, and correspond to the intercostal spaces.

40|$|BackgroundThe costovertebral joint {{complex is}} {{mechanically}} involved in both respiratory function and thoracic spine stability. The thorax {{has been studied}} {{for a long time}} to understand its involvement in the physiological mechanism leading to specific gas exchange. Few studies have focused on costovertebral joint complex kinematics, and most of them focused on experimental in vitro analysis related to loading tests or global thorax and/or lung volume change analysis. There is however a clinical need for new methods allowing to process in vivo clinical data. This paper presents results from in vivo analysis of the costovertebral joint complex kinematics from clinically-available retrospective data. MethodsIn this study, in vivo spiral computed tomography imaging data were obtained from 8 asymptomatic subjects at three different lung volumes (from total lung capacity to functional residual capacity) calibrated using a classical spirometer. Fusion methods including 3 D modelling and kinematic analysis were used to provide 3 D costovertebral joint complex visualisation for the <b>true</b> <b>ribs</b> (i. e. first seven pairs of ribs). FindingsThe 3 D models of the first seven pairs of costovertebral joint complexes were obtained. A continuous kinematics simulation was interpolated from the three discrete CT positions. Helical axis representation was also achieved. InterpretationPreliminary results show that the method leads to meaningful and relevant results for clinical and pedagogical applications. Research in progress compares data from a sample of healthy volunteers with data collected from patients with cystic fibrosis to obtain new insights about the costovertebral joint complex range of motion and helical axis assessment in different pathological conditions. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Received 12 June 2015; revised 26 October 2015; {{accepted}} 29 October 2015; Epub 2015 Nov 17 Objectives: Sagittal and axial rib orientation {{relative to}} the spine are two factors that modify rib cage morphology during ontogeny. Some studies suggest that these factors do not operate {{in the same way}} at the upper (ribs 1 – 5) and lower thorax (ribs 6 – 10) during postnatal growth, but it is unknown if the ontogenetic thoracic changes are produced by morphological changes of the ribs (intrinsic rib factors) or by external factors related to costal joints (extrinsic rib factors). Material and methods: To clarify these questions, we applied 3 D geometric morphometrics of landmarks and sliding semilandmarks (N[*]=[*] 20 /rib) to 280 individual ribs (1 – 10) of Homo sapiens comprising the entire human ontogeny and growth simulations were carried out. Results: PCA shows that intrinsic rib factors (rib torsion and axial rib curvature) are ontogenetic factors of variability that contribute to configuring the adult thorax shape. Moreover, growth simulations and regression slopes suggest that the upper thorax unit is comprised by ribs 1 – 7 and the lower unit at least by ribs 8 – 10. Discussion: These results suggest anatomical constraints for ontogenetic rib variation, since ribs 1 – 7 (<b>true</b> <b>ribs)</b> are directly linked to the sternum. Moreover, these results are supported by functional anatomy because pulmonary kinematics would influence the upper unit and diaphragmatic kinematics would influence the lower one. Our findings are relevant not only to understanding how changes at individual ribs contribute to the adult thorax morphology, but also to the development and evolution of the modern human rib cage.

60|$|Seven is {{the normal}} number of <b>true</b> <b>ribs,</b> but in two skeletons of the Sultan fowl (in which the fourteenth {{cervical}} vertebra was not furnished with little ribs) {{there were eight}} pairs; the eighth pair seemed to be developed on a vertebra corresponding with the first lumbar in G. bankiva; the sternal portion of both the seventh and eighth ribs did not reach the sternum. In four skeletons in which ribs were developed on the fourteenth cervical vertebra, there were, when these cervical ribs are included, eight pairs; but in one Game cock, in which the fourteenth cervical was furnished with ribs, there were only six pairs of true dorsal ribs; the sixth pair in this case did not have processes, and thus resembled the seventh pair in other skeletons; in this Game cock, as far as could be judged from {{the appearance of the}} lumbar vertebrae, a whole dorsal vertebra with its ribs was missing. We thus see that the ribs (whether or not the little pair attached to the fourteenth cervical vertebra be counted) vary from six to eight pair. The sixth pair is frequently not furnished with processes. The sternal portion of the seventh pair is extremely broad in Cochins, and is completely ossified. As previously stated, it is scarcely possible to count the lumbo-sacral vertebrae; but they certainly do not correspond in shape or number in the several skeletons. The caudal vertebrae are closely similar in all the skeletons, the only difference being whether or not the basal one is anchylosed to the pelvis; they hardly vary even in length, not being shorter in Cochins, with their short tail-feathers, than in other breeds; in a Spanish cock, however, the caudal vertebrae were a little elongated. In three rumpless fowls the caudal vertebrae were few in number, and anchylosed together into a misformed mass.|$|R
5000|$|The serratus ventralis muscle {{defines the}} area in the beef carcass from where short ribs come, and is the {{preferred}} muscle tissue for short ribs. This muscle originates near the second rib, and covers most of the rib cage. In the chuck area (second through fifth ribs), the muscle is much thicker. Moving toward the rump, the serratus ventralis becomes less dense, and may not cover the entire rib. Outside of the chuck, the serratus ventralis covers the entire rib with a degree of thickness only in the plate area. Over ribs nine through 12, the serratus ventralis is too thin to properly create a <b>true</b> short <b>rib,</b> and meat here is usually turned into a [...] "Royal short rib" [...] or else stripped from the bone and used for ground beef.|$|R
60|$|In G. bankiva {{there are}} {{fourteen}} cervical, seven dorsal with ribs, apparently fifteen lumbar and sacral, and six caudal vertebrae (7/71. It appears that I have not correctly designated the several groups of vertebrae, {{for a great}} authority, Mr. W.K. Parker ('Transact. Zoolog. Soc.' volume 5 page 198) specifies 16 cervical, 4 dorsal, 15 lumbar, and 6 caudal vertebrae in this genus. But I have used the same terms in all the following descriptions.); but the lumbar and sacral are so much anchylosed that I am not sure of their number, and this makes the comparison {{of the total number}} of vertebrae in the several breeds difficult. I have spoken of six caudal vertebrae, because the basal one is almost completely anchylosed with the pelvis; but if we consider the number as seven, the caudal vertebrae agree in all the skeletons. The cervical vertebrae are, as just stated, in appearance fourteen; but out of twenty-three skeletons in a fit state for examination, in five of them, namely, in two Games, in two pencilled Hamburghs, and in a Polish, the fourteenth vertebra bore ribs, which, though small, were perfectly developed with a double articulation. The presence of these little ribs cannot be considered as a fact of much importance, for all the cervical vertebrae bear representatives of ribs; but their development in the fourteenth vertebra reduces the size of the passages in the transverse processes, and makes this vertebra exactly like the first dorsal vertebra. The addition of these little ribs does not affect the fourteenth cervical alone, for properly the ribs of the first true dorsal vertebra are destitute of processes; but in some of the skeletons in which the fourteenth cervical bore little ribs the first pair of <b>true</b> <b>ribs</b> had well-developed processes. When we know that the sparrow has only nine, and the swan twenty-three cervical vertebrae (7/72. Macgillivray 'British Birds' volume 1 page 25.), we need feel no surprise at the number of the cervical vertebrae in the fowl being, as it appears, variable.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityIn the {{literature}} which is written on rodent myology {{there is not}} much reference made to the morphology of the golden hamster. Parsons (1896) reports on some hamsters that he dissected. Priddy and Brodie (1948) have published the only recent work on the morphology of the golden hamster. This study is concerned with the myology of the pectoral girdle of the golden hamster. The pectoral girdle is compared with that of the laboratory rat (Greene, 1935), the wood rat (Howell, 1926), the kangeroo rat (Howell, 1932), the pocket gopher (Hollinger, 1916) and the rabbit (Bensley, 1938). Parsons work on the comparative myology of the sciuromorphine, hystricomorphine and myomorphine rodents (1894 and 1896) is referred to extensively. The following muscles are included in this study: M. clavotrapezius, M. acromiotrapezius, M. spinotrapezius, M. sternomastoideus, M. cleidomastoideus, M. subclavius, M. atlantoscapularis, M. occipitoscapularis, M. levator scapulae, M. seratus magnus, M. rhomboideus anticus, M. rhomboideus posticus, M. acromiodeltoideus, M. spinodeltideus, M. suspraspinatus, M. infraspinatus, M. subscapularis, M. teres major, M. teres minor, M. coracobrachialis, M. pectoralis, M. latissimus dorsi, M. epitrochlearis, M. anconeus, M. triceps longus, M. triceps lateralis, M. triceps medialis, M. biceps brachii and M. brachialis. The origins and insertions or the following muscles had the normal relationships in the golden hamster: sternomastoideus, cleidomastoideus, subclavius, acromiodeltoideus, spinodeltoideus, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, teres major, latissimus dorsi, anconeus, triceps longus, triceps lateralis, triceps medialis and brachialis. The trapezius muscle in the hamster is clearly divided into three parts: clavotrapezius, acromiotrapezius and spinotrapezius. The origin of the spinotrapezius showed some variation in the animals that were dissected. The trapezius complex of muscles showed differences in the laboratory rat (Greene, 1935) and in the pocket gopher (Hollinger, 1916). The atlantoscapularis in the hamster arises from the atlas only, but in the rabbit the atlantoscapularis arises from the sphenoocipital synchondrosis. Parsons reports that in the sciuromorphine and hystricomorphine rodents (1894) the origin may be from either place mentioned above. The occipitoscapularis is a distinct muscle in the hamster, laboratory rat and the wood rat. Bensley (1938) treats this muscle {{as a part of the}} levator scapulae complex. Parsons (1894 and 1896) and Howell (1932) treat the occipitoscapularis as part of the rhomboideus complex. The levator scapulae in the hamster originates from the lateral processes of the last three cervical vertebrae and from the first three ribs. The other animals in this study vary considerably as to points of origin. The serratus magnus in the hamster originates from the third to the ninth rib. The other animals in this study vary considerably as to points of origin. Most of the authors in this study treated the levator scapulae as part of the serratus magnus complex and treat them both as one muscle. Greene (1935) treats them as separate muscles and so does Howell (1926). The rhomboideus complex in the hamster can be divided into a rhomboideus anticus and a rhomboideus posticus. Most of the authors consider them as one muscle consisting of two parts. Parsons (1896) considers the occipitoscapularis as a component of the rhomboideus complex and terms it the rhomboideus capitis. The teres minor is not distinguishable as a separate muscle in the golden hamster and is treated as part of the infraspinatus complex. Parsons (1896) reports that this is true in all the Myomorpha. The other authors treat the teres minor as a distinct muscle. In the hamster the coracobrachialis is treated as one muscle. Howell (1932) describes a pars profunda and a pars media in the kangeroo rat. Parsons (1894 and 1896) divides the coracobrachialis into three parts. The other authors included in this study treat the coracobrachialis as just one muscle. The pectoralis muscle in the golden hamster is divided into four parts. The first and second elements insert upon the deltoid crest of the humerus while the third and fourth elements are inserted slightly higher on the shaft, head and tuberosities of the humerus. The laboratory rat (Greene, 1935) has a xiphihumeralis that inserts upon the coracoid process of the scapula. The wood rat (Howell, 1926) is very similar to the hamster in the morphology of the pectoralis muscle. Parsons (1894 and 1896) describes a fourth part arising from some of the <b>true</b> <b>ribs</b> and inserting onto the shoulder capsule. Bensley (1938) reports that in the rabbit there is a pectoral element running from the sternum to the spine of the scapula. In the hamster and the wood rat the epitrochlearis runs between the latissimus dorsi and the inner elbow. In both animals it is a ribbon-like muscle and has a muscular origin and insertion. In the laboratory rat (Greene, 1935) the epitrochlearis is more compressed and has a tendinous origin and ins ertion. Bensley (1938) and Parsons (1894 and 1896) do not report this muscle. The biceps brachii in the golden hamster has two heads as is characteristic of the Myoraorpha (Parsons, 1896). The insertion of the biceps brachii varies slightly in the different animals of this study. In the pocket gopher (Hollinger, 1916) it inserts on the ulna. The insertion of the biceps brachii in the laboratory rat (Greene, 1935) is similar to that in the hamster, which is on the radius. The wood rat (Howell, 1926) is identical with the hamster. In the kangeroo rat (Howell, 1932) the two heads remain separate and the long head inserts upon the ulna while the short head inserts on the radius...|$|R
