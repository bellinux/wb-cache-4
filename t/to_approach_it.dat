5|$|At {{least three}} aspects of flowers {{appear to have}} coevolved between {{flowering}} plants and insects, because they involve communication between these organisms. Firstly, flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent; insects use this scent to determine how far away a flower is, <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>it,</b> and to identify where to land and finally to feed. Secondly, flowers attract insects with patterns of stripes leading to the rewards of nectar and pollen, and colours such as blue and ultraviolet, to which their eyes are sensitive; in contrast, bird-pollinated flowers tend to be red or orange. Thirdly, flowers such as some orchids mimic females of particular insects, deceiving males into pseudocopulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} also {{occasionally}} feeds on livestock or deer. It {{is the only}} species of New World vulture which preys on cattle. It occasionally harasses cows which are giving birth, but primarily preys on newborn calves. In its first few weeks, a calf will allow vultures <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>it.</b> The vultures swarm the calf in a group, then peck at the calf's eyes, or at the nose or the tongue. The calf then goes into shock and is killed by the vultures. Black vultures have sometimes been seen to pick ticks off resting capybaras.|$|E
5|$|Also {{noting the}} unachievable {{ambition}} {{of solving the}} conflict between naturalism and religion, Martin A Greenman, remarks that one must come to the book “with a certain mood”. Too critical a mood would blind the reader to its religious insights, while the sensitivity and depth of its philosophic insights would be lost if one were <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>it</b> in a too enthusiastically religious mood. Greenman finishes by justifying Stace’s philosophy to logical positivists by quoting from Wittgenstein's Tractatus: “My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them….He must surmount these propositions: then he sees the world rightly” (6. 54.) Dorothy M. Emmet found issue {{with the notion that}} the mystical experience is the point of intersection between the temporal and eternal orders. She writes that there are difficulties in Stace defining these orders as two distinct “orders of being”, rather than just as a way of speaking, because this then means some statements about the temporal order are relevant to what is said about the eternal order and vice versa. Indeed, the interrelation between these two orders is difficult to maintain. She also questioned Stace’s characterisation of mystical consciousness as being the same everywhere.|$|E

5|$|On 22 November Soviet forces {{began to}} cross the Don River and {{continued}} their advance towards the town of Kalach. German forces defending Kalach, mostly composed of maintenance and supply personnel, {{were not aware of}} the Soviet offensive until 21 November, and even then did not know in what strength the Red Army was approaching. The task of taking the bridge at Kalach was given to the Soviet 26th Tank Corps, which used two captured German tanks and a reconnaissance vehicle <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>it</b> and fire on the guards. Soviet forces broke into the town by mid-morning and drove the defenders out, allowing themselves and the 4th Tank Corps to link up with the Red Army's 4th Mechanized Corps approaching from the south. The encirclement of German forces in Stalingrad was completed on 22 November 1942. That day Soviet formations also continued to fight pockets of Romanian resistance, such as that put up by the Romanian 5th Corps.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman army did not {{march into}} Albania in one group. The first {{detachments}} to arrive were the Akıncı who marched through Dibra. Skanderbeg stalled this force's advance, but, once the main force arrived, the Albanians {{were not able}} to offer further resistance and withdrew. Realizing that both Ottoman commanders, Isak bey and Hamza, were familiar with the Albanian terrain and his tactics, Skanderbeg decided to adopt a new means of engagement. Normally, he would lure his enemy into a trap and then ambush them. His new tactic was very similar to his normal; however, he chose <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>it</b> in a different manner. To make it impossible to be followed, Skanderbeg split his forces into several groups and ordered their respective commanders to march through the forests and mountains in different directions and to never assemble or assault the Ottomans unless instructed to do so. The Albanian warriors were supplied by the locals and supply depots set throughout the mountains as they marched.|$|E

500|$|Not much {{is known}} about the species' behaviour, as it became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made. It is likely that the Choiseul pigeon was a largely terrestrial species, feeding and nesting near the forest floor. The indigenous people of the town of Vundutura said that the pigeon would roost in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs close to the ground. They claimed that the species was very tame, allowing local hunters <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>it</b> and pick it up off of its perch by hand. They reported that the species had stones in its gizzard. It laid a single dark, cream-coloured egg in an unlined depression on the ground. The egg was about [...] in size, which is considered small in proportion to the bird.|$|E

I know everyone's a little nervous and sceptical of 3-D these days, but the work has been done very, very well. We've done over 200 shots in 3-D and in the visual effects as well, because so much of it is CG, so the results are very, very good. I think everyone's going to be really {{impressed}} with it, actually." [...] Producer David Heyman spoke to SFX magazine about the 3-D conversion, saying that [...] "The way David Yates is approaching 3-D is he's trying <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>it</b> from a character and story point of view.

So I tried <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>it</b> in the most elegant, epic, big-movie way I could." [...] The director tried to design the shots with relative realism, inspired by footage of World War II Supermarine Spitfires in action.

Cheetahs hunt by vision rather than by scent. Prey is located from observation points or while roaming. Animals toward the edges of the herd are preferred. The cheetah will stalk their prey to within it will try <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>it</b> as closely as possible while concealing itself in cover, sometimes even up to [...] of the prey. The cheetah will crouch and move slowly while stalking, occasionally becoming motionless. The chase usually lasts less than a minute; if the cheetah fails to make a kill quickly, it will give up.

Ashman mailed a copy of his demo of [...] "Part of Your World" [...] to Benson, to which she listened in preparation for her audition. Benson then recorded a brief sample of the song on a reel-to-reel tape, which she mailed to Disney. All audition tapes were left unidentified so that the candidates would remain anonymous to Musker and Clements, delighting Ashman when the directors ultimately selected Benson's tape to be the voice of Ariel. Her first voice acting role, for which she had to be carefully trained on properly projecting into the studio microphone, Benson found the process of recording [...] "Part of Your World" [...] somewhat difficult after Ashman instructed her <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>it</b> as though she was reciting a monologue as opposed to singing a song, although she found Ashman telling her exactly how he wanted her to perform its lyrics helpful with benefiting her entire performance. Ashman remained in the recording booth with Benson during the entire recording process, advising her on performing the song with intensity as opposed to belting it and whispering lines to her as she sang them. It was rare for a filmmaker to direct a performer from within the booth, requiring Ashman to move carefully to prevent his gestures from being recorded by the microphone. Initially struggling to capture Ariel's [...] "tomboyish-ness and yearning", Benson requested that the studio's lights be dimmed to simulate the feeling of being underwater. Menken and Ashman deliberately selected segments from Benson's recording session that [...] "are not perfectly sung" [...] to include in the final version, ranging from unsustained, incorrect notes lacking in vibrato to spoken words, because the songwriters wanted her performance to sound as [...] "real" [...] as possible.|$|E
