50|$|The {{sequence}} of chapters in both books of The Shield of Achilles follows the {{sequence of}} the novel Nostromo by Joseph Conrad—present, past, future. Somewhat more prosaically, this is the order of Statement of Facts, Statement of Law, and Holding in an Anglo-American judicial opinion. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>parts</b> of Book I and Book II deal with 20th-century and contemporary events; the second parts of both books then flash back {{to the emergence of}} states in the 16th century and take the historical narrative up to the point where <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>parts</b> had begun; <b>the</b> third part of each book addresses the future, beginning where <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>parts</b> left off. This methodical if unorthodox sequencing allows the historian to avoid the tempting mechanics of foreshadowing, emphasizing the possibilities of different outcomes at each stage, and deepening the understanding of how the past can liberate the present.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>part</b> of {{the episode}} was written by Al Septien and Turi Meyer, whereas the second half was written by Peterson and Souders.

Souders later explained that the script had been finalized when Rosenbaum agreed to return to the series. As such, this forced the writers to redo parts of the episode to make room for his character.
