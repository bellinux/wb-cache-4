5|$|The Tevis novel {{had been}} optioned several times, {{including}} by Frank Sinatra, but attempts to adapt {{it for the}} screen were unsuccessful. Director Rossen's daughter Carol Rossen speculates that previous adaptations focused <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pool aspects {{of the story and}} not enough on the human interaction. Rossen, who had hustled pool himself as a youth and who had made an abortive attempt to write a pool-themed play called Corner Pocket, optioned the book and teamed with Sidney Carroll to produce the script.|$|E
5|$|Edward Duffy, an {{associate}} professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of Chamber of Secrets is a book, Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests that Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas. Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or chat room system, they agree about the dangers of relying <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Sarah-Jane and K9 {{returning}} to Doctor Who was {{an idea of}} Russell T Davies from pitching the show in 2003. Such a use would show what would happen after a companion left the Doctor, without dwelling <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> classic series. It was Davies' full intention for Sarah Jane {{to be used for}} this, and while Sladen originally declined a request, thinking her role would not be important, she changed her mind when she realised she would be {{the focal point of the}} adventure. After production of the episode was finished, Sladen was approached about a full spin-off series, The Sarah Jane Adventures, which was formally announced on 14 September 2006.|$|E

5|$|Viv wakes to find Bond gone, {{leaving a}} note in which he {{promises}} to send her police assistance and which he concludes by telling her not to dwell <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ugly events through which she has just lived. As Viv finishes reading the note, a large police detachment arrives. After taking her statement, the officer {{in charge of the}} detail reiterates Bond's advice, but also warns Viv that all men involved in violent crime and espionage, regardless of which side they are on—including Bond himself—are dangerous and that Viv should avoid them. Viv reflects on this as she motors off {{at the end of the}} book, continuing her tour of America, but despite the officer's warning still devoted to the memory of the spy who loved her.|$|E
5|$|Smyth sent {{an outline}} and rough {{draft of the}} report to Groves for {{approval}} in August 1944, followed in February 1945 by drafts of the first twelve chapters, leaving only the final chapter to be completed. Groves and Conant reviewed the drafts, and made several criticisms. They {{felt that it was}} too technical for general readers, did not mention the names of enough participants, and dwelt <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> activities at the Los Alamos Laboratory. Groves was particularly anxious that deserving people be mentioned, as he felt that this would lessen the danger of security breaches. After Smyth made a series of changes in response to this, Groves sent the manuscript to his scientific adviser, Richard Tolman. Tolman was assisted by two physicists who were working in his office at the National Defense Research Committee as technical aides, Paul C. Fine from the University of Texas, and William Shurcliff from Harvard University. They had the dual task of editing and censoring the manuscript.|$|E

Hot mix asphalt is applied at temperatures over 300°F (150°C) with a free floating screed. Warm mix asphalt is applied at temperatures of 200–250°F (95–120°C), resulting in reduced energy usage and emissions of volatile organic compounds. Cold mix asphalt is often used on lower-volume rural roads, where hot mix asphalt would cool <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> long trip from the asphalt plant to the construction site.|$|E
