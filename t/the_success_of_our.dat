2500|$|In the {{previous}} few years, SoftKey founder Kevin O'Leary had wanted the new The Learning Company {{to collaborate with}} developers to [...] "produce products to service that 40 {{percent of the market}} that hasn't bought educational software because of pricing issues." [...] This resulted in a new budget line of [...] "Platinum" [...] CD-ROM products; during this period The Learning Company would become known for aggressively driving down the development costs of products, and laying off employees in the companies it acquired. Post-1997 Madeline products were manufactured by BMG's manufacturing division, Sonopress, and order fulfillment was handled by BMG Distribution. These products were distributed {{to a wide range of}} retail outlets including: Best Buy, Circuit City, Computer City, Egghead Software, Office Depot, Price Club/Costco, Sam's Club, and Staples. [...] Robin Ray of the Boston Herald noted in 1998 that while new releases in kid's software used to be in the $50 range, they were now being released at $35, and with a rebate or a few months wait customers could often get them for half price; he deemed the repackaging of two separate games into Madeline's Thinking Games Deluxe as a [...] "bargain."

2500|$|On April 28, 1967, Westmoreland {{addressed}} {{a joint session}} of Congress. [...] "In evaluating the enemy strategy," [...] he said, [...] "it is evident to me that he believes our Achilles heel is our resolve. ... Your continued strong support is vital to <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> mission. ... Backed at home by resolve, confidence, patience, determination, and continued support, we will prevail in Vietnam over the communist aggressor!" [...] Westmoreland claimed that under his leadership, United States forces [...] "won every battle". The turning point of the war was the 1968 Tet Offensive, in which communist forces attacked cities and towns throughout South Vietnam. At the time, Westmoreland was focused on the Battle of Khe Sanh and considered the Tet Offensive to be a diversionary attack. It is not clear if Khe Sanh was meant to be distraction for the Tet Offensive or vice versa; sometimes this is called the Riddle of Khe Sanh. Regardless, U.S. and South Vietnamese troops successfully fought off the attacks during the Tet Offensive, and the communist forces took heavy losses, but the ferocity of the assault shook public confidence in Westmoreland's previous assurances {{about the state of the}} war. Political debate and public opinion led the Johnson administration to limit further increases in U.S. troop numbers in Vietnam. Nine months afterward, when the My Lai Massacre reports started to break, Westmoreland resisted pressure from the incoming Nixon administration for a cover-up, and pressed for a full and impartial investigation by Lieutenant General William R. Peers. However, a few days after the tragedy, he had praised the same involved unit on the [...] "outstanding job", for the [...] "U.S. infantrymen had killed 128 Communists [...] in a bloody day-long battle". Post 1969 Westmoreland also made efforts to investigate the Phong Nhị and Phong Nhất massacre a year after the event occurred.|$|E
