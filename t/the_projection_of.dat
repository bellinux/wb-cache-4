5|$|The known {{expansion}} {{rate of the}} Homunculus Nebula provides an unusual geometric method for measuring its distance. Assuming that the two lobes of the nebula are symmetrical, <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> the nebula onto the sky depends on its distance. Values of 2,300, 2,250 and 2,300parsecs have been derived for the Homunculus, and Eta Carinae is clearly at the same distance.|$|E
5|$|The pinnae have {{an effect}} on facial appearance. In Western societies, {{protruding}} ears (present in about 5% of ethnic Europeans) have been considered unattractive, particularly if asymmetric. The first surgery to reduce <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> prominent ears was published in the medical literature by Ernst Dieffenbach in 1845, and the first case report in 1881.|$|E
5|$|In {{approximately}} 1200 a north aisle was added, {{with its}} width being determined by <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> the north transept chapel, {{with the west}} and east walls taken down at the time. The different thickness of the walls in the present church suggests that the wall {{for the length of}} the first three bays of the arcade was taken down and rebuilt in the 13th century. The church underwent a restoration in 1839, with £370 being spent, and in 1875 at a cost of £2,377.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> a disk of stars in an eccentric orbit around the central black hole. The eccentricity is such that stars linger at the orbital apocenter, creating a concentration of stars. P2 also contains a compact disk of hot, spectral class A stars. The A stars are not evident in redder filters, but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus, causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1.|$|E
5|$|The museum's {{first floor}} main gallery space houses the {{permanent}} exhibitions. These {{consist of a}} chronological display which runs around the gallery's 200m perimeter and six thematic displays in 'silos' within the space. The walls of the gallery space are used as screens for <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> an hourly audiovisual presentation, the Big Picture. The main gallery, described as cavernous and dramatic, includes objects such as a Russian T-34 tank, a United States Marine Corps AV-8A Harrier jet, and a British 13-pounder field gun which fired the British Army's first shot of the First World War. The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions, mounted in a separate gallery.|$|E
25|$|In {{regards to}} mutual length contraction, Fig.nbsp&2‑9 {{illustrates}} that the primed and unprimed frames are mutually rotated by a hyperbolic angle (analogous to ordinary angles in Euclidean geometry). Because of this rotation, <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> a primed meter-stick onto the unprimed x-axis is foreshortened, while <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> an unprimed meter-stick onto the primed x′-axis is likewise foreshortened.|$|E
50|$|A {{commutative}} C*-algebra is an AW*-algebra if {{and only}} if its spectrum is a Stonean space.

25|$|A {{technique}} to eliminate mechanical scanning of the grating and still retain the maximum spatial resolution is electronic phase stepping. It scans the source spot of the x-ray tube with an electro-magnetic field. This causes <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> the object {{to move in}} the opposite direction, and also causes a relative movement between the projection and the Moiré fringes. The images are digitally shifted to realign the projections. The end result is that <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> the object is stationary, while the Moiré fringes move over it. This technique effectively synthesizes the phase stepping process, but without the costs and delays associated with mechanical movements.|$|E
25|$|Most modern historians {{regard the}} treaty, {{together}} with other French military alliances of the period, as failures, because they failed to create a strong alliance network that was capable of preventing <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> German power in the late 1930s.|$|E
