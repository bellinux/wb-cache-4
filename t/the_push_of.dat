5|$|The Spanish vanguard {{was driven}} {{off by the}} English at the first charge, but the Spanish pikemen under Captains Pedro Manrique and Manuel de Vega, from Francisco Arias de Bobadilla's and Juan del Águila's tercios, formed the {{defenders}} into squadron formation and kept the way open for the wagons. As the carters fled {{at the beginning of}} the fight, the Spanish arquebusiers had to take their places and brought the wagons towards Zutphen. Stanley's pikemen charged upon the Spanish squadron, but they were repelled at <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>of</b> pike. As the fight approached Zutphen and Francisco Verdugo noticed the musketry fire, he ordered a wagon to be loaded with powder and bullets and sent it to the Spanish arquebusiers. The English cavalry, in the meantime, charged over the Spanish pikes on one of its flanks. Though they succeeded in breaking the two or three foremost ranks, Essex's men could not penetrate further. Twice more the English charged upon the squadron, but they were as well repelled.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens to}} music {{composed}} by Johann Sebastian Bach. Its tiled maze contains 256 screens and is drawn in a 16 by 16 grid. The maze's paths are bordered by tropical flora, populated with attacking enemies and, on its outskirts, surrounded by mountains. Apart from the jungle, the game's maze also includes several lakes. The player swings Sabreman's sabre with <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>of</b> the joystick's fire button to defeat enemies that spawn in random on-screen locations. When the player idles {{too long in}} the same screen, an indestructible bushfire appears to pursue Sabreman. Enemies include spiders, scorpions, snakes, bats, indigenous people, sleeping hippos, and a fast wolf (the titular Sabre Wulf). Some enemies are killed, others flee when hit, while the wolf, cave guardian, and bushfire are unaffected by the sabre.|$|E

On February 11, 1959, water was diverted through the tunnels so dam construction could begin. Later that year, the bridge was completed, allowing trucks to deliver equipment and materials for the dam, and also for the new town of Page, Arizona.|$|E

Before 1830, the spinner would operate a partially powered mule with a maximum of 400 spindles after, self-acting mules with up to 1,300 spindles could be built.|$|E
25|$|The western {{defenses}} were {{pierced by}} two gates: the Lenba (the main gate) and a secondary one, {{closer to the}} beach. By that stage there were scarcely 300 Spaniards left, most of which had no fireams. Carleill ordered Sergeant-Major Powell to assault the secondary gate with a storming party, while the lieutenant-general led {{the rest of his}} men towards the Lenba. Both English columns broke into a run and charged at <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>of</b> pike. Following a mingled fierce hand-to-hand fight, the Spanish were swept on through both gates and then melted away, after which neither column met with any serious opposition. The stormers did not stop until the two English columns met in the Plaza.|$|E

25|$|Bandai {{released}} {{a number of}} action figures related to the film; these toys including {{a number of different}} Baymax figures. One is a soft plastic 10-inch version that includes a series of projected stills from the film on his stomach, which can be changed when the figure's arm is moved, and which emits accompanying sounds. Deluxe Flying Baymax, which retails for $39.99, depicts the armored version of the character and features lights and sounds that activate at <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>of</b> a button. Placing the Hiro figurine on his back changes the sounds into speech and when the figure is tilted, the sounds are those of flying. The Armor-Up Baymax (original retail cost $19.99) comes with 20 pieces of armor that can be assembled onto the robot by the owner. The other characters from the film, including the other members of team and Professor Callaghan (who is called Yokai) are issued in 4-inch action figures, each of which have eight points of articulation.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, the {{negotiations}} involve {{a large number}} of other people working behind the scenes.

Therefore, a special pneumatic tube conveyor needs to be designed to shoot Au grains. The shooting subdevice that we developed satisfies the requirement for shooting Au grains.|$|R
500|$|Light gun {{shooters}} typically feature [...] "on-rails" [...] movement, {{which gives}} the player no control over the direction the protagonist moves in; the player only has control over aiming and shooting. Some games, however, may allow the protagonist to take cover at <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>of</b> a button. Other games may eschew on-rails movement altogether and allow the player to move the protagonist freely around the game's environment; still others may feature a static environment. Light gun shooters utilise a first person perspective for aiming, though some games may allow the player {{to switch to a}} third person perspective in order to maneuver the protagonist.|$|E
500|$|Mass Effect has an {{optional}} subplot where the player {{can develop a}} romantic relationship with a non-player character. If the relationship becomes more intimate, a cutscene containing partial nudity and sexual activity is shown. The scene first came under scrutiny in an article by neoconservative blogger Kevin McCullough, who employed statements such as [...] "Mass Effect can be customized to sodomise whatever, whomever, however, the game player wishes", and [...] "with its over the net capabilities virtual orgasmic rape is just <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>of</b> a button away." [...] The article was criticized by the gaming community and long-time anti-obscenity campaigner Jack Thompson, who said that [...] "this contrived controversy is absolutely ridiculous."

500|$|Jagnow {{commented on}} several changes the {{developers}} {{would have made}} in hindsight {{after the completion of}} the ARG. One aspect he considered was the weak part of the fiction of the ARG, something he believed they would have integrated more in the game from the start. The release of the Potato Sack on April 1 may have been a bad decision according to Jagnow, as they did not get the press exposure they thought they would in conjunction with the other April Fool's events occurring that day, with some media outlets hesitant to report on potential pranks for fear of having to retract these later. In the third phase, where certain players were [...] "taken over" [...] by GLaDOS, Jagnow felt they extracted these players from the game too early as they were influential in coordinating the chat rooms and wiki, leaving the remaining players confused. Instead, Jagnow suggested they should {{have found a way to}} allow these players to continue participating until near the end. Jagnow considered <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>of</b> the crescendo of the ARG, the [...] "appearance" [...] of GLaDOS@Home, to have been the biggest failing. Originally scheduled for April 16 or 17, it was pushed to April 15 to allow more players, including international ones, to participate in the effort to release Portal 2 early, and to gain media attention. [...] Instead, the developers found that existing players of the ARG were frustrated with no new puzzles to solves, while new players brought to the site by the media were skeptical and saw the event as [...] "a cheap media ploy to get players to buy the Potato Sack in the hope of an early Portal 2 release".|$|E

500|$|Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. It {{was called a}} [...] "masterpiece" [...] by several reviewers who viewed it as {{a departure from the}} mainstream, hip hop-oriented R of the time. Maxwell was also compared to soul singers of the 1960s and 1970s. Writing for Vibe, OJ Lima said the record was a [...] "refreshing detour from hump-bouncin' '90s R", while Dimitri Ehrlich from Entertainment Weekly wrote that Maxwell [...] "smooths hip-hop's and soul's edges, proving that black dance music doesn't automatically mean ghetto culture." [...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News called it [...] "one of the few modern sex albums to offer a sense of succor", and Urban Latino hailed it as [...] "one of the most soulful releases of the year", writing that Maxwell exhibited [...] "the soul of Curtis Mayfield, the poetics of Beni More and the stage presence of Michael Jackson, pre-Thriller". In American Visions, Michael George wrote, [...] "In an age where young, black artists are criticized (often rightly so) for misogynistic lyrics, Maxwell's focus on commitment is refreshing. But more important, he can flat-out sing." [...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Arion Berger later said, [...] " [...] laid-back romanticism has heat at its core and a powerful groove that grounds the music: By varying <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>of</b> the beat but retaining the central mellow vibe, Maxwell creates a sound as felicitous on headphones {{as it is in the}} bedroom." [...] Peter Shapiro was more critical, panning Maxwell's lyrics and calling the album an [...] "overly mannered pastiche of early 70s soul ... all style and no substance". In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau jokingly accused Maxwell of [...] "expiring of Afrocentric texturitis", while rating the album a [...] "dud", which indicated [...] "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought".|$|E
