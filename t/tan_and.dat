5|$|Due to the English Water Spaniel's colours {{of liver}} (<b>tan)</b> <b>and</b> white, {{it has been}} {{suggested}} that the breed may have been the source of the colours now found in the modern English Springer Spaniel and Welsh Springer Spaniel breeds.|$|E

5|$|After its founding, {{the school}} offered {{comprehensive}} secondary level Chinese education. It remained funded {{and supported by}} Tan Kah Kee until shortly before World War II. In 1934, Lee Kong Chian, son-in-law of Tan Kah Kee, became {{the chairman of the}} school's board and remained in his post until 1955. During his tenure, the school faced the threat of closure several times due to financial difficulties, but managed to survive due to strong financial support from both <b>Tan</b> <b>and</b> Lee. Together they built a legacy, which the current school body commemorates them for.|$|E

Nguyen Thien Thuat, who had {{been active in the}} northern provinces of Hưng Yên and Hải Dương, fled to Guangxi in China. The supporters of <b>Tan</b> <b>and</b> Tuat moved south and integrated into Phan's force.|$|E
5|$|Mars is {{approximately}} half {{the diameter of}} Earth with a surface area only slightly less than the total area of Earth's dry land. Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity. The red-orange appearance of the Martian surface is caused by iron(III) oxide, or rust. It can look like butterscotch; other common surface colors include golden, brown, <b>tan,</b> <b>and</b> greenish, depending on the minerals present.|$|E

5|$|The mass of spores is blackish brown, {{or brown}} if viewed under polarised light. The surface texture ranges from almost smooth to warty, and the spores measure 7–9µm in diameter. Material {{collected}} from Oregon, however, varies from European material in several ways: the fruit body is brown; the branching of the capillitium from the columella differs (having {{primary and secondary}} branches instead of radiating branches from an expanded tip); the spore mass is <b>tan,</b> <b>and</b> individual spores measure 10–12µm.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of 1967 the Viet Cong seemed to have melted away in Phuoc Tuy province, abandoning many of their bunker systems and {{avoiding}} the main roads and towns. The Battle of Long <b>Tan</b> <b>and</b> Operation Bribie had weakened the communist forces in the province, while further operations had restricted their movement and logistics. This prompted the commander of the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF)—Brigadier Stuart Graham—to speculate that the Viet Cong may have fled to the border, perhaps leaving the province altogether. Graham reasoned that a succession of operations in the south-east of the province and the completion of the barrier minefield at Dat Do meant that no single, sizable threat remained to the populated areas of Phuoc Tuy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tan</b> <b>and</b> four blind friends {{auditioned for}} the inaugural season of Project SuperStar, but only he was {{accepted}} as a contestant. Throughout the competition, there was extensive debate over whether viewers were voting for him out of sympathy and whether a blind man who could not dance deserved the title. Further controversy arose when his home address was posted online and fans offered him sex services. Nevertheless, he emerged as the male champion and entered the grand final against female champion Kelly Poon. The judges gave Poon more favourable reviews, but Tan garnered 64% of the 533,000 telephone votes. Both finalists also released limited edition singles; Tan's cover of 童话 (Fairytale) by Michael Wong sold 12,239 copies, while Poon's cover of 遗失的美好 (Lost Goodness) by Angela Chang sold 11,319 copies. Thus Tan became the grand champion and was awarded a recording contract with Play Music (later acquired by Warner Music).|$|E

5|$|Two-color {{varieties}} {{always have}} a white base color with areas of the second color. <b>Tan</b> <b>and</b> white {{is the most common}} two-color variety, but there is a wide range of other colors including lemon, a very light tan; red, a reddish, almost orange, brown; and liver, a darker brown, and black. Liver is not common and is not permitted in some standards; it tends to occur with yellow eyes. Ticked or mottled varieties may be either white or black with different colored flecks (ticking), such as the blue-mottled or bluetick beagle, which has spots that appear to be a midnight-blue color, similar to the coloring of the Bluetick Coonhound. Some tricolor beagles also have ticking of various colors in their white areas.|$|E
5|$|On October 11, 1964, the National Liberation Front in South Vietnam {{was ordered}} {{to carry out a}} series of {{military}} operations as part of the Communist winter-spring offensive. The NLF Nam Bo (Mekong Delta) Regional Command established a sub-command under the leadership of Trần Đình Xu, with Nguyễn Hòa as the deputy commander, and Lê Trọng Tấn as the political commissar. Their mission was to inflict damage on the regular units of the ARVN and destroy the strategic hamlets constructed by the former Ngô Đình Diệm regime. The Viet Cong identified the regions of Bình Long-Phước Long and Bà Rịa-Long Khánh, along Route 14, as the main targets for their offensive. Meanwhile, the Central Military Commission in Hanoi appointed General Nguyen Chi Thanh as the commander of North Vietnamese military operations in southern Vietnam. Other high-ranking officers such as Major Generals Lê Trọng <b>Tấn</b> <b>and</b> Trần Độ, and Colonel Hoàng Cầm were sent to South Vietnam to supervise the military build-up which would commence in November 1964.|$|E
5|$|Yet such flaws {{were not}} {{immediately}} obvious {{and by the}} second half of 1967 the Viet Cong in Phuoc Tuy Province seemed to have melted away, abandoning many of their bunker systems and avoiding the main roads and towns. The Battle of Long <b>Tan</b> <b>and</b> Operation Bribie had weakened the communist forces in the province, while further operations had restricted their movement and logistics. This prompted Graham to speculate that the Viet Cong may have fled to the border, perhaps leaving the province altogether. He reasoned that a succession of operations in the south-east of the province and the completion of the barrier minefield at Dat Do meant that no single, sizable threat remained to the populated areas of Phuoc Tuy. Meanwhile, despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by the ruling military junta, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful, with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent. Graham believed that the large public turnout in Phuoc Tuy had been due to the long-term effects of Australian operations in the province which had increased the population's sense of security. During his tour of duty the task force had conducted 32 operations before he handed over command in October 1967. He was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).|$|E

5|$|In February 1967 1 ATF {{focused on}} the Dat Do area and the {{south-east}} of Phuoc Tuy province, initiating a program of conventional operations and pacification, with 5 RAR concentrating on cordon and search and civic action against Viet Cong cadres in the villages, while 6 RAR was tasked with search and destroy missions targeting the Viet Cong D445 Battalion. During the first week 6 RAR conducted ambushes along Route 23 between Dat Do and the Suoi Tre river, pre-empting Viet Cong attacks in the area during the Tet holiday. The results of this operation were modest, and the Australians suffered a number of casualties from a misplaced fire mission from the 161st Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery which killed four and wounded 13, including Warrant Officer Class Two Jack Kirby, who had earlier received the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions at Long <b>Tan,</b> <b>and</b> was among the dead. Meanwhile, 5 RAR continued its cordon and search operations. On 13–14 February the battalion completed a cordon and search of An Nhut, just west of Dat Do, with South Vietnamese forces, apprehending 14 Viet Cong suspects, five communist sympathisers, two South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) deserters and a draft dodger. The Australians again suffered heavy casualties after the officer commanding C Company, his second-in-command, and a New Zealand artillery forward observer were killed by an unrecorded ARVN mine. Regardless, these operations met with some success, and over a six-day period the battalion captured 40 Viet Cong. Yet even as Graham continued to refine his strategy the Viet Cong struck, and this sudden initiative would force the Australians into the type of conventional engagement that Westmoreland had been advocating.|$|E

On 15 July 2009, <b>Tan</b> <b>and</b> Selangor state {{government}} aide Teoh Beng Hock were {{brought by the}} Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) to their Selangor headquarters for questioning in connection with allegations of graft against the Selangor government. Both <b>Tan</b> <b>and</b> Teoh were interrogated late into the night. After Tan's interrogation concluded {{in the early hours}} of 16 July, the MACC told him to go home and return for further questioning at 11 in the morning. Tan decided to stay overnight at the MACC office. Teoh, who was also sleeping there, later fell to his death from the MACC office block; his death is the subject of an ongoing inquest. Teoh's case prompted the announcement of a Royal Commission of inquiry into the MACC's investigation procedures, to be formed after the conclusion of the inquest.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurposeExposure to {{ultraviolet}} radiation (UVR) from indoor tanning devices {{is thought to}} cause melanoma and other negative health consequences. Despite these findings, the practice of indoor tanning in the United States remains prevalent. In this paper we aim to present a clear discussion {{of the relationship between}} indoor <b>tanning</b> <b>and</b> melanoma risk, and to identify potential strategies for effective melanoma prevention by addressing indoor tanning device use. Basic proceduresWe reviewed relevant literature on the risks of indoor tanning, current indoor <b>tanning</b> legislation, <b>and</b> trends in indoor <b>tanning</b> <b>and</b> melanoma incidence. Study was conducted at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA between the years of 2014 and 2015. Main findingsOur findings reaffirm the relationship between indoor <b>tanning</b> <b>and</b> melanoma risk, and suggest a widespread public misunderstanding of the negative effects of indoor tanning. Principal conclusionsThis review argues for an aggressive initiative to reduce indoor tanning in the United States, to design prevention efforts tailored towards specific high risk groups, and the need to better inform the public of the risks of indoor tanning...|$|R
