40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the effect of}} biofertilizers (PolyFunKur and Agromik) on agronomically valuable groups of microorganisms {{in order to determine}} their quantity depending on the phenol phases of maize. Methods: phenological, agrochemical, microbiological. Studies were carried out on sod–podzolic light–clay soil. The studies of the quantity of agronomically valuable groups of microorganisms with PolyFunKur in the <b>tillering</b> <b>phase</b> revealed that eight of nine groups had increased their quantity from 0. 3 to 1. 8 times over the control; only cellulose–destroying aerobic microorganisms had decreased their quantity in 3. 5 times under the control. Most of the groups of microorganisms increased their quantity over the control in case of Agromik as well. The total amount of microorganisms assimilating mineral nitrogen was almost equal in both tests. As in the <b>tillering</b> <b>phase,</b> in the beginning of flowering phase, eight of nine groups had increased their quantity over the control in case PolyFunKur test. In the case of Agromik, the quantity of micromycetes and spore ammonifiers in the control was higher while the quantity of cellulose–destroying aerobic bacteria was almost the same in the tillering phase; and was higher by more than 27 times than in PolyFunKur test {{in the beginning of the}} flowering phase. The quantity of all the studied agronomically valuable groups of microorganisms in PolyFunKur test was higher than in the control and in the Agromik test in the cob-forming phase...|$|E

40|$|In fresh moist meadows, double-cut, {{located in}} the Bydgoszcz Canal Valley, you can find Ostericum palustre, a species of {{priority}} importance, which requires protection {{in the form of}} designation of Natura 2000 sites. The aim of the present research was to define the effect of the cutting date on blooming and fruit-bearing of O. palustre in meadows covered by the PO 1 b agro-environmental programme. Phenological observations included three populations of O. palustre. The first one occurs in a traditionally used meadow, not covered by the agro-environmental programme (2) where the date of the first cut falls in mid June. The second one is located in a meadow covered by the agro-environmental programme (1) where the first cutting date is possible from July 1, and the third population located in a natural meadow is not agriculturally used (0). The present research showed that individuals of O. palustre in the traditionally used meadows (2), prior to the first cut, reach the leaf rosette phase, while individuals which occur in the meadow covered by the agro-environmental programme (1), prior to the first cut, reach the generative <b>tiller</b> <b>phase.</b> Full bloom of O. palustre in the traditionally used meadows occurs after July 20, while individuals of O. palustre in the agro-environmental programme reach that phase only at the beginning of August. At the same time, about August 6, the first inflorescence in 70 % of individuals in the agriculturally unused meadow (0) has ripe fruit, and in mid August all fruits are ripe. In mid August 70 % of individuals in the meadow used for traditional cutting have ripe fruits of the first inflorescence, and right before the second cut, on August 27, almost 90 % of fruits were ripe. Most O. palustre individuals in the meadows covered by the agro-environmental programme do not finish blooming of the first inflorescence before mid August. By the end of August, about 60 % of individuals reach the phase of young fruits. The first ripe fruits occur as late as September 12. About September 20 most fruits are ripe. To sum up, delayed PO 1 b agro-environmental programme meadow cutting, after July 1, does not facilitate the production of ripe fruit in O. palustre individuals...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{a study of}} the relationship between biophysical parameters of the rice fields and radar backscattering coefficients from SAR images. It also studies the images of cultivated rice fields using multi-temporal SAR images. The GlobeSAR program (a joint project between CCRS and MACRES) was carried out in Malaysia from November 1993 to October 1996. In November 1993, the airborne scatterometer CV- 580 SAR was used to collect multi polarized C-band images from the rice paddy in Kedah, Malaysia. From the images it is shown that the HH polarization provides distinct differences in backscattering coefficients from paddy fields at different growth stages. Then we continue to study the capability of monitoring of wetland paddy fields by using the satellite borne RADARSAT SAR images. The approach includes using the RADARSAT Data Standard Mode 7, C- band HH polarized data. Four field measurements were conducted in conjunction with the satellite acquisition which fell on 12 th May, 5 th June, 29 th June and 23 rd July 1997. Those dates correspond to different stages of paddy growth, I. e. vegetative <b>phase</b> (1 st <b>tillering),</b> vegetative <b>phase</b> (2 nd and 3 rd <b>tillering),</b> reproductive <b>phase</b> and ripening phase. There are no distinct row and column effects because the farmers practiced random broadcasting method. Ground measurements were colected which consisted of paddy parameters and moisture, water and soil condition. Two sites were selected: Kampung Tanah Seratus and Kampung Teluk Jawa. Two sets of graphs have been plotted showing the backscatter returns, paddy height above water and plant moisture at diffent growth stages. In {{the last part of the}} thesis, the production of the rice mapping for the early rice and late rice is done based on the SAR images. The average difference value of 3 dB is observed between the vegetative stage and reproductive stage. This is chosen as the threshold value in the change detection module in the PCI Easi Pace software. The Kuan Filter (extended Kuan minimum-mean-square-error filter) is used to reduce the speckle, and ratioing technique is applied in the multi temporal image. The result of rice mapping from the change detection method is compared with the rice map obtained from the Department of Agriculture. The strong match shows that the SAR images have a great potential as a monitoring tool for the paddy field growth stage study...|$|R
30|$|Growth of {{the rice}} plant {{is divided into}} three phases: the {{vegetative}} (from germination to panicle initiation), reproductive (from panicle initiation to heading) and grain filling or ripening phase (from heading to maturity) (Li, 1979). Yield components are progressively determined along the rice cycle, first during the vegetative <b>phase</b> (<b>tiller</b> number), second during the reproductive phase (number of fertile tillers and size of panicle sinks) and finally during the grain filling phase (spikelet filling rate). Sink-based yield potential is thus fixed by the flowering stage (Xiong et al. 2011) and depends mostly on the dimensioning of crucial organs that occurs during the reproductive phase. This is the time when the morphological structure of the panicle bearing the sinks, but also the size of internodes that store C reserves, become effective.|$|R
40|$|Rice has {{generally}} been reported to yield less in aerobic soil conditions than in flooded soil conditions, in association with delayed anthesis {{and a reduction in}} height. Agreenhouse experiment was conducted and repeated twice with four rice varieties grown in either flooded or nearly-saturated aerobic soil, in either large or small pots. The rate of leaf appearance was recorded weekly until heading time, when plants were harvested for shoot and root biomass. The kinetics of leaf appearance was generally trilinear with longer phyllochrons in the May sowing. Pot size had only a small effect whereas aerobic soil conditions sloweddownthe rate of leaf initiation, which consequently delayed panicle initiation and heading date and thus increased the duration of the <b>tillering</b> <b>phase</b> and finally the number of tillers. Surprisingly, the four varieties showed a significant response to sowing date, especially IR 72, which headed 21 days later and after the expansion of two more leaves in theMaysowing. The aerobic soil conditions and sowing date have thus changed the rate of development of rice plants and this trait has appeared to be the initial link of a chain of consequences in a series of traits known to be affected by these factors.

40|$|Wheat is {{the most}} {{important}} cereal crop in the semi-arid eastern Mediterranean region that includes northern Syria. Knowledge of wheat root depth and the vertical distribution during the winter growing season is needed for sound scheduling of irrigation and efficient use of water. This article reports evaluation of root development for three winter-grown bread (Triticum aestivum L.) and durum (Triticum turgidum L.) wheat under four soil water regimes (rainfed and full irrigation with two intermediate levels of 33 and 66 % of full irrigation). Roots were sampled by soil coring to a depth of 0. 75 m at four occasions during 2005 - 2006 growing season. Two distinct phases of root development were identified, a rapid downward penetration from emergence to end <b>tillering</b> <b>phase,</b> followed by a substantial root mass growth along the profile from tillering to mid-stem-elongation phase. Roots were detected as deep as 0. 75 m during the initial rapid penetration, yet only 29 % of the total seasonal root mass was developed. This downward penetration rate averaged 7 mm d- 1 and produced 10. 8 kg ha- 1 d- 1 of root dry-biomass. The bulging of root mass from tillering to mid-stem-elongation coincided with vigorous shoot growth, doubling root dry-biomass at a rate of 52 kg ha- 1 d- 1, compared to the seasonal root growth rate of 18. 3 kg ha- 1 d- 1. A second-degree equation described the total root dry-biomass as a function of days after emergence (r 2 =  0. 85), whereas a simpler equation predicted it as a function of cumulative growing degree days (r 2 =  0. 85). The final grain yield was a strong function of irrigation regimes, varying from 3. 0 to 6. 5 t ha- 1, but showed no correlation with root biomass which remained similar as soil water regimes changed. This observation must be viewed with care as it lacks statistical evidence. Results showed 90 % of root mass at first irrigation (15 April) confined in the top 0. 60 - 0. 75 m soil in bread wheat. Presence of shallow restricting soil layers limited root depth of durum wheat to 0. 45 m, yet total seasonal root mass and grain yield were comparable with non-restricted bread wheat. Most root growth occurred during the cool rainy season and prior to the late irrigation season. The root sampling is short of rigorous, but results complement the limited field data in literature collectively suggesting that irrigation following the rainy season may best be scheduled assuming a well developed root zone as deep as the effective soil depth within the top meter of soil. ...|$|E

There {{are many}} herbicide application options for sugarcane pre-emergence but, currently, post-emergence control {{is the great}} challenge. The objective of this work was to evaluate {{the efficiency of the}} herbicide mesotrione in mixture with ametryn and metribuzin in the post-emergence control of ten weeds sown in sugarcane, variety RB 86 - 7515. The weeds used in the experiment were: Brachiaria decumbens, Brachiaria plantaginea, Cenchrus echinatus, Digitaria horizontalis, Panicum maximum, Amaranthus deflexus, Bidens pilosa, Euphorbia heterophylla, Ipomoea nil and Sida glaziovii, sown in between the rows after crop emergence. The herbicides were applied on the 45 th day after sugarcane planting when the monocotyledon weeds reached the third <b>tiller</b> <b>phase</b> and the dicotyledon weeds completed three to four leaves. The following treatments were carried out: mesotrione (120 g ha- 1); ametryn (2, 000 g ha- 1); metribuzin (1, 920 g ha- 1); mesotrione + ametryn (120 g + 2, 000 g ha- 1); mesotrione + metribuzin (120 g + 1, 920 g ha- 1) and control with and without weeds.

Measured traits included: time to terminal spikelet, flag leaf and anthesis, final leaf number and phyllochron, number of spikelets per spike, rate and duration of tillering, maximum tiller number.

40|$|Grain yield {{in spring}} wheat, Triticum aestivum L., {{is in part}} {{determined}} {{by the number of}} spikes per unit area. With the exception of high plant density crops, spike numbers are in turn the end-product of the tillering process common to all grass species. A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the tillering patterns of diverse spring wheat genotypes under the short growing season conditions of central Saskatchewan. In addition, experiments were carried out to determine how consistently tillering patterns were expressed in different years, locations, seeding rates, seeding dates, seeding depths and temperatures. Significant genotypic variation was detected for the following tillering pattern components: time to tiller emergence, maximum tiller number, tiller mortality and spike number. Maximum tiller number consistently exhibited the greatest variability among genotypes with a five and 2. 5 -fold range at 5 and 100 % of the commercial seeding rate (230 seeds/m 2), respectively. Genotypes which produced large tiller populations did so by producing more secondary tillers as a result of higher individual tiller emergence and survival frequencies. Cultivars in which tillers emerged when the main stem was less developed had higher tiller grain yields but were late maturing. Lower tillering cultivars were characterized by a lower synchronization of tiller emergence and a greater phytomass differential between the main stem and its second leaf tiller at the mid- to late-tillering phase. On a crop basis there was no relationship between a genotype's yielding ability and either its tillering capacity or tiller mortality. Cultivars with diverse tillering habits (free-tillering, low-tillering and oligoculm) responded differently to changing environments as illustrated by cultivar x seeding rate and cultivar x year interactions for tillering characteristics and yield components. The genotype x environment (G x E) interactions for tillering did not involve changes in cultivar rank while those for a number of yield components did. The G x E interactions for yield components were ascribed to a pronounced reduction in the means of the low-tillering and oligoculm cultivars at higher seeding rates under extended pre-anthesis drought conditions. Several years of testing led to the conclusion that oligoculm cultivars are not suited to the erratic precipitation distributions common to central Saskatchewan. Under field and/or controlled environment conditions increases in seeding depth (1 to 3 cm) had a slight effect on tillering, reducing the rate of tillering, shortening the <b>tillering</b> <b>phase,</b> and reducing maximum tiller number, tiller mortality and spike number. Under controlled environment conditions temperature was shown to have a pronounced effect on the rate of tillering but little impact on maximum tiller number. Similarly, under field conditions delayed seeding had little effect on maximum tiller number. Heritability estimates for maximum tiller numbers based on the variance component method were high and G x E effects negligible, indicating that genotypic tillering characteristics are expressed consistently across environments. A lack of heterosis combined with few deviations from normality in F 2 population distributions suggests that tillering capacity is controlled by genes with largely additive effects. It is suggested that selection for maximum tiller number could be carried out during early generations in solid seeded plots. However, the fact that grain yields were not associated with a particular tillering capacity leads {{to the conclusion that the}} manipulation of this trait would not be a productive breeding venture...|$|E

The weed density was 300 and 1800 plants m- 2 respectively. Pig slurry was applied by hand in microplots by four methods:broadcasting followed by incorporation,or injected in bands to depths of 5, 10 or 15 cm. Spring barley and weeds were sampled separately six times during the <b>tillering</b> and elongation <b>phase</b> of the spring barley. The effect of application method on dry-matter (d. m.) production, nitrogen uptake and recovery of applied nitrogen in the spring barley and the weeds is reported. Slurry banding halved the weed d. m. and weed N uptake compared with broadcasting,irrespective of weed density. Weeds recovered up to 12 %of the applied nitrogen, which made them a signi ﬁcant competitor when the slurry was broadcast and incorporated. Banding by direct injection reduced the slurry:soil contact and the weed:crop competition balance for applied nitrogen moved in favour of the crop. Thus, the crop recovery of applied nitrogen {{at the end of the}} sampling period was increased from approximately 45 % for broadcast and incorporated to approximately 50 % for injected slurry, and coincidental weed recovery was reduced to a maximum of 5 %. As the nitrogen supply normally affects plant d. m. production, banding of slurry might well improve crop competitiveness and its tolerance to mechanical weed control...|$|R

A field experiment consisting of a plant and first ratoon crop of cultivar N 49 was conducted near Komatipoort. For the three water stress treatments, available soil water (ASW) was maintained between 30 and 60 % of capacity during the <b>tillering</b> <b>phase</b> (TP), stalk elongation phase (SEP) and through both phases. ASW was maintained above 60 % of capacity in the well-watered control and during periods when stress was not intended. Rainfall prevented water stress from developing in the TP of the plant crop. In the ratoon crop, 72 % less irrigation was applied in the TP, resulting in 50 days of stress (ASW< 50 %). This did not affect stalk population but reduced CWU by 13 %, shortened stalks by 21 % and affected the canopy by reducing green leaf number (GLN) and green leaf area index (GLAI). Relieving the stress during SEP allowed the crop to re-establish its canopy, capture adequate photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and restore rates of photo-assimilation (as suggested by CWU) and stalk elongation to support rapid biomass production. This restoration of plant processes allowed the ratoon crop to attain a cane and stalk dry biomass (SDM) yield that was only 9 and 11 % lower (statistically insignificant), respectively, than the well-watered control at lodging (crop age of 286 days). During the SEP of the plant and ratoon crop, 42 and 85 % less irrigation was applied, resulting in the crops experiencing 74 and 39 days of stress and using 7 and 8 % less water, respectively. This did not affect stalk population or the crop canopy, but reduced stalk height by about 6 and 14 % in the plant and ratoon crops, respectively. In both crops, shorter stalks and a negatively affected CWU which reduced photo-assimilate production, reduced cane yield by 14 and 10 % (statically insignificant) and SDM yield by 15 and 5 % (statistically insignificant), in the plant and ratoon crops respectively. © University of Pretoria iv Deficit irrigation throughout the TP and SEP of the ratoon crop reduced irrigation amount by 74 %, resulting in 110 days of stress and reducing CWU by 16 % and stalk height by 14 %. PAR capture was reduced through reduced GLAI. This resulted in a significant reduction of 15 % in cane yield. SDM yield was reduced by 17 %, although this was not statistically significant. Stalk sucrose content was not influenced by deficit irrigation but was rather dependent on the duration of the drying-off period prior to harvest. Sucrose yields were therefore largely determined by SDM. Results suggest that the soil water potential (SWP) measured at 0. 25 and 0. 40 m depths, halfway between drip emitters within a plant or ratoon crop, can drop to about - 40 kPa before irrigation is applied, without sacrificing cane or sucrose yield. Lastly, a ratoon crop can rapidly recover from stress during the TP, provided that the SWP during SEP is maintained above - 40 kPa.
