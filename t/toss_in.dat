5|$|The 1978 American League East tie-breaker {{game was}} a one-game {{extension}} to Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1978 regular season, played between the rival New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox {{to determine the}} winner of the American League's (AL) East Division. The game was played at Fenway Park in Boston, on October 2, 1978. The tie-breaker was necessitated after the Yankees and Red Sox finished the season tied for first place in the AL East with identical 99–63 records. The Red Sox were the home team by virtue of a coin <b>toss.</b> <b>In</b> baseball statistics, the tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular season game for both teams, with all events in the game added to regular season statistics.|$|E

On the opening day of the 2016 season, four captains opted to bowl first with the choice of batting or bowling being decided by a <b>toss</b> <b>in</b> just one match.|$|E
25|$|Super Bowl XL was {{dedicated}} to King and Rosa Parks. Both were memorialized with {{a moment of silence}} during the pregame ceremonies. The children of both Parks and King then helped Tom Brady with the ceremonial coin <b>toss.</b> <b>In</b> addition two choirs representing the states of Georgia (King's home state) and Alabama (Park's home state) accompanied Dr. John, Aretha Franklin and Aaron Neville in the singing of the National Anthem.|$|E
25|$|Philadelphia won {{the coin}} <b>toss</b> <b>in</b> overtime, {{but they were}} forced to punt after three plays and Chatman {{returned}} the ball 15 yards to the 42-yard line. However, Dawkins intercepted Favre's first pass of the ensuing drive and returned it 35 yards to the Packers 34-yard line. An 11-yard run by Staley and an 8-yard reception by Pinkston then set up a 31-yard field goal from Akers to win the game.|$|E

Staubach played at the United States Naval Academy and was the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl VI, which was played 30 years prior at New Orleans' Tulane Stadium.|$|E
25|$|Sri Lanka won the <b>toss</b> <b>in</b> {{the final}} and sent Australia in to bat despite the team batting first having won all five {{previous}} World Cup finals. Mark Taylor top scored with 74 in Australia's total of 241 for 7. Sri Lanka won the match in the 47th over with Aravinda de Silva following his 3 for 42 with an unbeaten 107 {{to win the}} Player of the Match award.

25|$|The Dolphins won the <b>toss</b> <b>in</b> overtime, {{but after}} a holding penalty {{they were forced to}} punt, and the Colts {{advanced}} into Miami territory. Faced with third down and 12 from the Dolphins 42-yard line, Manning completed an 11-yard pass to Marvin Harrison. The Dolphins were offside on the play, but the Colts elected to decline the penalty and attempt a 49-yard field goal to win the game. However, Vanderjagt's kick was wide right. The Dolphins then marched 61 yards in 11 plays, ending with Smith's game-winning touchdown.|$|E
25|$|Nepal won the <b>toss</b> <b>in</b> Kathmandu and batted first. After losing {{two quick}} wickets they {{consolidated}} and finished a rain-affected {{first day on}} 246 for 5. On day two they declared on 287 for 7. Nepal's bowlers then performed well, dismissing the United Arab Emirates for 164, with Arshad Ali carrying his bat for 81. In reply, Nepal proceeded to 45 for 2 by stumps on the second day. On {{the third and final}} day, Nepal declared on 125 for 6. Binod Das then took 5 for 27 to help dismiss the Emiratis for 76.|$|E
25|$|The {{second test}} started {{in much the}} same way as the first, with Daniel Vettori winning his ninth <b>toss</b> <b>in</b> a row and again asking Bangladesh to bat first. Their batting {{collapsed}} {{in much the same}} way as the first innings of the Dunedin test as they went to lunch at 86 for five. Chris Martin and Iain O'Brien were the main wicket-takers with five and three wickets respectively as Bangladesh were dismissed for 143. Martin's five wicket haul was his eighth in tests and moved him up to sixth on New Zealand's all-time wicket taking list, equal with Ewen Chatfield on 123 wickets.|$|E

25|$|In One Day International cricket, {{the time}} of day is also a crucial factor in {{determining}} the captain's decision at the <b>toss.</b> <b>In</b> some parts of the world, dew on the ground can be significant. In a day-night game, grounds in some countries like India or South Africa become wet due to dew, which makes it difficult for a spinner to grip the ball. The captain must balance this against a consideration for bowling becoming more effective under lights, since the ball might skid off any dew on the pitch or get assistance in swing from the cooler night-time air. Even for a day game, the captain might be inclined to exploit early morning dew on the pitch.|$|E
25|$|This {{continued}} as Australia lost the First Test by nine wickets, drew the Second Test, then won the <b>toss</b> <b>in</b> the Third Test at Manchester. Gambling on batting first on green pitch, Australia slumped to 3/42 {{in the first}} hour when Waugh came out to bat. He made 108. Similarly, he began his second innings with Australia on 3/39 and scored 116. These two centuries in a low-scoring match won the game. Australia levelled the series and regained the initiative, retaining the Ashes with a 3–2 result. Waugh's only other notable score was 75, scored in the Fifth Test win at Nottingham, and he finished with 390 runs at 39 average for the series.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} home of {{the more}} vocal fans is considered the Gallowgate End, {{in the same vein}} as The Kop for Liverpool FC. The Gallowgate End was the end that the team attacked in the second half if they win the coin <b>toss.</b> <b>In</b> recent years there has been unofficial fan movement to create a singing section in the Leazes End upper tier, partly to counter the away fans, and partly to recreate some atmosphere lost since the recent expansion over 36,000. This group of fans call themselves the 'Toon Ultras'. Level 7 of the Milburn Stand houses the official Family Enclosure. Due to the expansion of the Family Enclosure, many fans from the singing section have relocated to the Strawberry Corner.|$|E

25|$|Bangladesh won the <b>toss</b> <b>in</b> {{the first}} of three matches, and under cloudy skies they chose to bowl first, putting faith in his newly {{composed}} seam bowling attack of Tapash Baisya and Syed Rasel with the new ball. However, the pair leaked runs during the first eight overs, and the score was 51 for 0 when Baisya ran in to bowl his fifth over of the day and Bangladesh's ninth. However, Sanath Jayasuriya was bowled by an inswinging delivery from Baisya for 25, and that slowed Sri Lanka down. Baisya even bowled a maiden over as the Sri Lankans chose to wait out the middle overs and set the platform for big hitting at the end - which worked perfectly.|$|E
25|$|The 1941–42 {{season was}} Basel's third {{season in the}} 1st League (second flight of Swiss football) after relegation. Eugen Rupf was player-coach for his second year. Basel {{finished}} their season as winners of group East. In the play-offs against group West winners Bern, the away tie ending with a goalless draw and Basel won their home tie 3–1 to achieve Promotion. In the Swiss Cup five home games, a coin <b>toss</b> <b>in</b> the quarter-final and a replay in the semi-final was needed {{to qualify for the}} final. The final against Grasshoppers ended goalless after extra time and a replay was required here too. In the replay – played at the Wankdorf Stadion against the Nationalliga champions – Basel led at half-time through two goals by Fritz Schmidlin, but two goals from Grubenmann a third from Neukom gave Grasshoppers a 3–2 victory.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan toured India {{during the}} 1960–61 season but with little reward as all 15 matches on their tour, {{including}} five Tests, were drawn. Just as seven years previous, the series contained dour and defensive cricket as both sides appeared intent on avoiding defeat rather than attempting to win. Fazal won the <b>toss</b> <b>in</b> {{the first four}} Tests {{but only in the}} third Test at Eden Gardens did Pakistan gain a first innings lead. In that match Fazal took 5/26 off 25.3 overs, but he failed to take a wicket in India's second innings as they batted out time comfortably. Apart from that five-for, his 13th and last in Test cricket, Fazal took only four other wickets in the series. Fazal's captaincy received severe criticism with accusations of favouritism, and following the final Test he was sacked as captain.|$|E
