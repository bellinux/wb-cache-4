5|$|Gunboat {{diplomacy}} {{was typically}} conducted by cruisers or smaller warships. A British squadron of three protected cruisers and two gunboats {{brought about the}} capitulation of Zanzibar in 1896; and while battleships participated in the combined fleet Western powers deployed during <b>the</b> <b>Boxer</b> rebellion, the naval part of the action was performed by gunboats, destroyers and sloops.|$|E
50|$|In 1900, <b>the</b> anti-colonial <b>Boxer</b> Rebellion (August 1899 - September 1901) {{reinforced}} the racist stereotypes of Asian {{people as a}} Yellow Peril to white people. The Society of the Righteous and Harmonious Fists (<b>the</b> <b>Boxers)</b> was a xenophobic martial-arts organization who blamed the problems of China {{on the presence of}} Western colonies in China proper. <b>The</b> <b>Boxers</b> sought to save China by killing every Western colonist and Chinese Christian - Westernized Chinese people. In early summer of 1900, Prince Zaiyi allowed <b>the</b> <b>Boxers</b> into Beijing, to kill Western colonists and Chinese Christians, in siege to the foreign legations. Afterwards, Ronglu, Qing Commander-in-Chief, and Yikuang, Prince Qing, resisted and expelled <b>the</b> <b>Boxers</b> from Beijing after days of fighting.|$|R
50|$|The Chinese Imperial Tenacious Army under General Nie Shicheng was {{waging a}} brutal {{campaign}} to suppress <b>the</b> <b>Boxers</b> under orders from Commander in Chief Ronglu. At {{the same time}} General Nie was fighting <b>the</b> <b>Boxers</b> (Militia United in Righteousness, Yihetuan), the foreign Eight-Nation Alliance launched an invasion of China to reach the Legations at Beijing. The Imperial Court then decided to change its tack and halt the suppression campaign against <b>the</b> <b>Boxers</b> and fight <b>the</b> foreigners instead. There was too much bad blood between General Nie and <b>the</b> <b>Boxers</b> for them to cooperate with each other against the foreigners, so in response, the Imperial Court sent another Chinese Army, the Muslim Kansu Braves under the anti-foreign General Dong Fuxiang fight alongside <b>the</b> <b>Boxers</b> against <b>the</b> foreign Eight-Nation Alliance forces.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Boxers</b> were an anti-Christian, anti-foreign rural mass movement. Their {{objective}} was to rid China of foreign (Western) influence. In May and early June 1900, they advanced on Beijing. The Qing government of China was equivocal about <b>the</b> <b>Boxers,</b> fearing that they might become anti-Qing. <b>The</b> <b>Boxers</b> were {{a serious threat to}} Western and Japanese citizens and Chinese Christians living in Beijing, Tianjin, and other areas of northern China.|$|R
5|$|Hispanics in the United States Marine Corps, such as Private France Silva who during <b>the</b> <b>Boxer</b> Rebellion {{became the}} first Marine of the {{thirteen}} Marines of Hispanic descent to be awarded the Medal of Honor, and Private First Class Guy Gabaldon who is credited with capturing over 1,000 enemy soldiers and civilians during World War II, have distinguished themselves in combat.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Boxer</b> Movement, or Boxer Rebellion, was a Chinese {{uprising}} from November 1899 to September 7, 1901, {{against foreign}} influence {{in areas such}} as trade, politics, religion and technology that occurred in China during the final years of the Manchu rule (Qing Dynasty).|$|E

5000|$|In mid-June 1900 the Chinese {{government}} was still indecisive about <b>the</b> <b>Boxers.</b> Some officials—Ronglu, for example—counseled the Empress Dowager that <b>the</b> <b>Boxers</b> were [...] "rabble" [...] {{who would be}} easily defeated by foreign soldiers. On {{the other side of}} the question were anti-foreign officials who advised cooperation with <b>the</b> <b>Boxers.</b> [...] "The Court appears to be in a dilemma," [...] said Sir Robert Hart. [...] "If <b>the</b> <b>Boxers</b> are not suppressed, the Legations threaten to take action—if the attempt to suppress them is made, this intensely patriotic organization will be converted into an anti-dynastic movement." [...] The event that irrevocably pushed the Chinese government to the side of <b>the</b> <b>Boxers</b> was <b>the</b> attack by foreign warships on the Dagu forts on June 17. The attack was made to try to maintain communications with Tianjin and aid an army under the command of Adm. Edward Seymour in its attempt to march to Beijing during the Seymour Expedition and reinforce the Legations.|$|R

5|$|All six ships served {{abroad for}} the {{majority}} of their careers, primarily in Africa and the south Pacific, where they assissted in the suppression of uprisings such as <b>the</b> <b>Boxer</b> Rebellion in China and the Sokehs Rebellion in the Caroline Islands. Cormoran participated in the seizure of the Kiautschou Bay concession in China in 1897, and Falke was involved in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–03. Bussard and Falke were broken up for scrap in 1912, but the remaining four ships were still in service following the outbreak of World War I in August 1914.|$|E
5|$|Brandenburg and {{her three}} sisters served {{in a wide range}} of roles. In 1900, the four ships were {{deployed}} to China during <b>the</b> <b>Boxer</b> Rebellion, after which they were substantially modernized. In 1910, two of the ships, Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and Weissenburg, were sold to the Ottoman Navy. Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm was sunk in 1915 by a British submarine while Weissenburg survived the war, only to be broken up in 1938. Brandenburg and Wörth saw limited service during World War I as coastal defense ships before they were withdrawn for auxiliary duties. Both ships were sold for scrapping in May 1919.|$|E
50|$|Yuan Shikai and Zhang Zhidong ignored Empress Dowager Cixi's {{declaration}} of war against the foreign powers and continued to suppress <b>the</b> <b>Boxers.</b> In addition to not fighting the Eight-Nation Alliance and suppressing <b>the</b> <b>Boxers</b> in Shandong, Yuan and his army (the Right Division) also helped the Eight-Nation Alliance suppress <b>the</b> <b>Boxers</b> after <b>the</b> Alliance captured Beijing in August 1900.

5000|$|Authorities differ as to {{the origin}} of <b>the</b> <b>Boxers,</b> but they became {{prominent}} in Shandong in 1898 and spread northward toward Peking. They were an indigenous peasant movement, related to the secret societies that had flourished in China for centuries—and which, on occasion, had threatened Chinese central governments. <b>The</b> <b>Boxers</b> were named—probably by American missionary Arthur H. Smith—for their acrobatic rituals which included martial arts, twirling swords, prayers and incantations. Similar to other anti-Western millenarianism movements around the world, such as the Ghost Dance in <b>the</b> US, <b>the</b> <b>Boxers</b> believed that with the proper ritual they would become invulnerable to Western bullets. The religious and magical practices of <b>the</b> <b>Boxers</b> had [...] "as a paramount goal the affording of protection and emotional security {{in the face of}} a future... that was fraught with danger and risk." [...] <b>The</b> <b>Boxers</b> had no central organization but appear to have been organized on the village level. They were anti-foreign and anti-missionary. Their slogan was [...] "Support the Qing! Destroy the Foreigner!". [...] Initially feared as a possible threat by the Chinese government, they slowly gained the support of influential politicians in Peking, who saw <b>the</b> <b>Boxers</b> as a movement that could be used to eliminate foreign influence in China.|$|R
50|$|Ronglu {{also kept}} Nie Shicheng from {{finding out about}} an {{imperial}} decree that ordered him to stop fighting <b>the</b> <b>Boxers.</b> Nie Shicheng continued to fight <b>the</b> <b>Boxers</b> and killed many of them. Ronglu also ordered Nie Shicheng to protect foreigners and protect the railway from attacks by <b>the</b> <b>Boxers.</b> Ronglu had effectively derailed Prince Duan's efforts to capture the legations, and as a result, saved the foreigners inside. He was shocked {{that he was not}} welcome after the war; however, the foreign powers did not demand that he, unlike Dong Fuxiang, be punished.|$|R

40|$|When we {{consider}} <b>the</b> <b>Boxers</b> Uprising, which developed without any "Preestablished Harmony" in the rebellion itself, {{it is necessary}} to focus not only on what was peculiar to <b>the</b> <b>Boxers</b> Uprising but also on the universality observed in popular movements of all ages and places in general, tracing the actual developments of each mass insurrection. In other words, for the better understandings of <b>the</b> <b>Boxers</b> Uprising, it may be required to start not from the analysis of "the Boxers" but from that of "the Uprising". <b>The</b> <b>Boxers</b> Uprisings should be juxtaposed with Commune de Paris as a movement which embraced "reproduction" and "endlessness".
