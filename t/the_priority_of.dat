5|$|Emergency {{ambulances}} {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a road traffic collision, as these emergencies create people who are likely to be in need of treatment. They are required to gain access to patients as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws. For instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or stop sign as a yield sign ('give way'), or be permitted to break the speed limit. Generally, <b>the</b> <b>priority</b> <b>of</b> the response to the call will be assigned by the dispatcher, but <b>the</b> <b>priority</b> <b>of</b> the return will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in significant danger to life and limb (as determined by triage) require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel, and because of this need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with passive and active visual and/or audible warnings to alert road users.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, the {{interpretation}} of Magna Carta and the First Barons' War shifted.

40|$|Former {{studies have}} focused on issue {{prioritization}} in parliaments and compared <b>the</b> <b>priorities</b> <b>of</b> both political elites and citizens to measure their level of responsiveness to the general public. To date, this topic was examined in more than twenty countries, which are exclusively democratic systems. This paper aims to contribute to the comparative agendas' politics literature by testing issue-congruency under competitive authoritarian regimes. Analyzing more than 10, 000 legislative texts, mainly parliamentary draft bills and questions, and matching them with public opinion data on citizen priorities in Morocco, we found a substantial level of issue congruence between <b>the</b> <b>priorities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elites and citizens. The level of congruency is particularly higher for parliamentary questions compared to draft bills. The results also demonstrate that contrary to the earlier theories on clientelism and citizen-politician linkages in the Middle East, <b>the</b> <b>priorities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major political parties largely reflect <b>the</b> <b>priorities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general public rather than <b>the</b> <b>priorities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party supporters...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: General {{practitioners}} (GPs) {{are expected}} to be responsive to patients' expectations, but patients and doctors may have different views on what constitutes good general practice care. AIM: To elicit areas of controversy as well as areas of mutual agreement between the opinions of patients and GPs with regard to good general practice care. METHOD: A questionnaire, distributed to 850 patients and 400 GPs, measured which of 40 aspects of general practice care were given priority. A second questionnaire, distributed to 400 different GPs, measured the GPs' perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>priorities</b> <b>of</b> patients. RESULTS: <b>The</b> <b>priority</b> rank order <b>of</b> all 40 aspects was highly correlated for patients and GPs (0. 72), as was the rank order of aspects for patients and the perception of them by GPs (0. 71). Nevertheless, when comparing <b>the</b> <b>priorities</b> <b>of</b> patients and GPs, 23 out of 40 aspects differed significantly (P = 0. 00125) in their rank number. Similarly, when comparing <b>the</b> <b>priorities</b> <b>of</b> patients with <b>the</b> perception of them by GPs, 23 aspects differed significantly. CONCLUSIONS: There is great similarity between <b>the</b> <b>priorities</b> <b>of</b> patients and those of GPs. GPs are quite capable of assessing most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>priorities</b> <b>of</b> patients. However, potentially controversial areas of general practice care do exist...|$|R

5|$|However, {{by the end}} of the year, the United States {{had failed}} to achieve the {{objectives}} of Rolling Thunder, because North Vietnam continued to send its troops and military supplies down the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which demonstrated that the North Vietnamese Government was not ready to quit the war. In response to domestic political pressure to do more, President Johnson shifted priority of the campaign to interdiction. From summer 1965 to the winter period of 1966–67, the campaign was aimed at degrading North Vietnam’s capability to infiltrate and send men into South Vietnam. Again, America’s shift towards interdiction also failed, and the Johnson administration was forced to change <b>the</b> <b>priority</b> <b>of</b> the bombing campaign. For the third phase of Rolling Thunder, which occurred from spring 1967 to early 1968, bombing operations were focused on industrial and transportation targets in and around Hanoi, Hai Phong and the buffer zone near the Chinese border.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, the Joint Working Party of {{international}} scientific bodies International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) recognized the element's discovery and assigned <b>the</b> <b>priority</b> <b>of</b> the discovery to the Dubna–Livermore collaboration.

The goal of that experiment had been the synthesis of 294Ts via the reaction 249Bk(48Ca,3n), but the short half-life of 249Bk resulted in a significant quantity of the target having decayed to 249Cf, resulting in the synthesis of oganesson instead of tennessine.|$|E
5|$|Lutetium was {{independently}} {{discovered in}} 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James. All of these researchers found lutetium as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia, which was previously thought to consist entirely of ytterbium. The dispute on <b>the</b> <b>priority</b> <b>of</b> the discovery occurred shortly after, with Urbain and Welsbach accusing each other of publishing results {{influenced by the}} published research of the other; the naming honor went to Urbain, as he had published his results earlier. He chose the name lutecium for the new element, but in 1949 the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium. In 1909, the priority was finally granted to Urbain and his names were adopted as official ones; however, the name cassiopeium (or later cassiopium) for element 71 proposed by Welsbach was used by many German scientists until the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|During {{the design}} process, {{it was decided}} that the utmost concern was that the ships could be built quickly and placed into service. The ships were to discard the use of {{broadside}} belt armor below the waterline, the attachment of which was an extremely long process. It was believed that the higher speed of the class——would make up for the vulnerability to torpedo attack and make the armor unnecessary.The initial designs called for three main battery turrets, each mounting a pair of new 42cm guns, though this was later increased to four twin turrets. However, the work that would have been necessary to design and test the new turret clashed with U-boat construction, which had become <b>the</b> <b>priority</b> <b>of</b> the Navy. Krupp, the firm that had been awarded the contract to conduct the testing, informed the Reichsmarineamt (RMA—the Imperial Navy Office) that design work on the new turret would have to wait. Capelle accepted the news without much objection. Nevertheless, the ships were never built. The RMA filed a report dated 1 February 1918, which stated that capital ship construction had ground to a halt, primarily due to the shifting priorities to the U-boat war.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{works of}} art that exhibit traces {{of the influence of}} the Parthenon frieze belong to the media of vase painting and grave stelae where we may find some echo not just of motifs, themes, poses, but tenor, as well. Direct imitation, and indeed quotation, of the frieze begins to be pronounced around 430 BC. One example, an explicit copy, is a pelike attributed to the Wedding Painter of a youth “parking up” a horse exactly in the manner of figure W25 on the frieze. While those vase paintings that resemble the frieze cluster around 430, the vases that quote the pediments are datable nearer {{to the end of the}} century, giving further evidence of <b>the</b> <b>priority</b> <b>of</b> the sculptural program. More accomplished painters also found inspiration in the sculpture, namely Polygnotos I and his group, especially the Peleus Painter, the Kleophon Painter and the late work of the Achilles Painter. Later painters of talent also managed to capture the mood of eusebeia, or thoughtful piety of the procession, as, for example, on the volute krater of the Kleophon Painter of a sacrifice to Apollo, which shares the quiet dignity of the best of High Classical sculpture.|$|E
