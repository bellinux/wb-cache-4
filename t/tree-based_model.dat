This paper focuses on optimizing the runtime performance of applying such models to make predictions, given an already-trained model. Although exceedingly simple conceptually, most implementations of <b>tree-based</b> <b>models</b> do not efficiently utilize modern superscalar processor architectures. By lay-ing out data structures in memory in a more cache-conscious fashion, removing branches from the execution flow using a technique called predication, and micro-batching predictions using a technique called vectorization, we are able to bet-ter exploit modern processor architectures and significantly improve the speed of <b>tree-based</b> <b>models</b> over hard-coded if-else blocks.

40|$|Flood is a {{frequent}} natural hazard that has significant financial consequences for Australia. In Australia, physical losses caused by floods are commonly estimated by stage-damage functions. These methods usually consider only {{the depth of the}} water and the type of buildings at risk. However, flood damage is a complicated process, and it is dependent on a variety of factors which are rarely taken into account. This study explores the interaction, importance, and influence of water depth, flow velocity, water contamination, precautionary measures, emergency measures, flood experience, floor area, building value, building quality, and socioeconomic status. The study uses <b>tree-based</b> <b>models</b> (regression trees and bagging decision trees) and a dataset collected from 2012 to 2013 flood events in Queensland, which includes information on structural damages, impact parameters, and resistance variables. The tree-based approaches show water depth, floor area, precautionary measures, building value, and building quality to be important damage-influencing parameters. Furthermore, the performance of the <b>tree-based</b> <b>models</b> is validated and contrasted with the outcomes of a multi-parameter loss function (FLFArs) from Australia. The <b>tree-based</b> <b>models</b> are shown to be more accurate than the stage-damage function. Consequently, considering more parameters and taking advantage of <b>tree-based</b> <b>models</b> is recommended. The outcome is important for improving established Australian flood loss models and assisting decision-makers and insurance companies dealing with flood risk assessment...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{the design and}} {{analysis}} of revenue sharing schemes for viral marketing over social networks. The increasing need for monetizing social networks more effectively is causing social network platforms to look for alternatives to online behavioral targeting. Specifically, we turn to cooperative game theory and the Shapley value to design revenue sharing schemes to incentivize users to help the social network platform for more effective viral marketing. Our goal is to identify mechanisms that achieve desirable objectives in terms of computability, individual rationality, and potential reach. In particular, we propose multi-level revenue sharing for referral-based and viral marketing over online social networks. We show via simulations that users have more incentive to collaborate with the social network platform in implementing the campaign when the revenue or discount is shared across multiple levels rather than the commonly used single-level model. For this purpose, we design the graph-based model, for which we show that computing the Shapley value is #P-hard. However, we show that in a variation of that model, which we call the <b>tree-based</b> <b>model,</b> computing the Shapley value becomes polynomial time. We also show that the revenue function is supermodular only in the <b>tree-based</b> <b>model.</b> Supermodularity of the revenue function entails desirable corollaries. 1...|$|E

The main observation of this study indicates that the difference between the testing and training error from a cross-validated tree classifier and an oracle classifier empirically has a linear regression relation. The “slope ” and the “R 2 ” of regression models are employed as the performance measures of a cross-validated tree classifier. Moreover, simulation reveals that the performance of a cross-validated tree classifier depends on the geometry, the parameters of the underlying distributions, and sample size.
