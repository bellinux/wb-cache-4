The empirical portion of this study segments the air freight market of Taiwanese high-tech industry. Five segmentation variables are identified and examined using 511 air shipment contracts collected from 151 high-tech manufacturers. The study results conclude that market classification between forwarder and express is less clearly defined due to carriers' service enlargements and customers' changing needs. Shipment destination and size may still serve as effective market classifications to divide air freight market into twelve segments, whereas time in transit, shipment frequency, and product status, have lost their validation in segmenting the market.

40|$|This chapter explores a way {{stoichiometry}} {{is introduced}} to {{secondary school students}} that aims at fostering a conceptual understanding and a relational understanding of the chemistry triplet (i. e. macro, submicro and symbolic). We start by discussing students’ difficulties in understanding macro phenomena, submicro and symbolic representations {{that are relevant to}} the learning of stoichiometry. Then we argue that a teaching sequence starting with macro phenomena, then a submicro representation of the corresponding macro phenomena, and finally deriving a chemical equation based on the submicro representation, should be likely to facilitate students’ understanding of stoichiometry. Strategies that guide the selection of a particular macro phenomenon and diagrammatic representation of submicro interactions are proposed. We then analyze a lesson that was conducted based on the design. Particularly, we focus on good practice of teaching with diagrammatic representation of submicro phenomena that served <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>macro</b> phenomena and chemical equations as symbolic representations...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE - This paper aims {{to explain}} through a {{statistical}} model {{the link between}} innovation and performance. The data taken into consideration is from Unicredit Group survey for the period 2004 - 2006 on Italian manufacturing firms. METHODOLOGY - We consider a broad concept of innovation: investments in R&D and technology, new processes, new products, innovation in terms of marketing and organization, investments in training of human resources. Performance is {{measured in terms of}} ROA without considering extraordinary items and taxes, to eliminate exceptional events and fiscal aspects. FINDINGS - With respect to innovation strategies, we find a weak, but significant, relationship between ROA and innovation. In addition, the influence of innovation on ROA does depend on innovation types and industry structures. Conversely, the amount of innovation expenditures does not have an influence on performance. LIMITATIONS - The main limitations of our analysis are represented by the missing values coming from the financial reporting in short form and by the consideration of a short time period (the year 2006), with reference to the innovation expenditures and the measurement of performance. IMPLICATIONS - From a managerial point of view, our model describing the relationship between innovation drivers and financial performance might represent a useful tool for managers aiming to introduce or implement innovation strategies in their organization. ORIGINALITY - Innovation is a common topic in econometric studies but not so much in managerial and accounting literature. The goal of the paper is <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>macro</b> and micro perspectives in a combined framework based on managerial and financial accounting...|$|R
40|$|Concerns {{over the}} effects of {{globalisation}} and liberalisation have intensified the debates over the trajectories and underlying sources of regional inequality. This paper attempts <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>macro</b> studies of regional inequality to micro studies of local development and to expand the research on intraprovincial inequality in China to Guangdong Province. First, substantial evidence has been provided to illustrate the extent of polarisation between the Pearl River Delta (PRD) and the periphery, especially since the early 1990 s. Second, {{it has been found}} that new economic spaces centred on exoproduction centres, high-tech zones, university clusters, and entrepreneurial spaces driven by the domestication of globalisation and the growth of the knowledge economy have emerged as new engines of regional growth. The orthodox notion of the PRD development as externally driven has become obsolete, and a new conceptualisation centred on the knowledge economy and integrated development better explains regional development and polarisation in Guangdong. Finally, the theoretical and policy implications of the research are discussed. The emerging form of regional development in the PRD represents an effort to make the knowledge economy the new engine of regional development and indicates that developing countries such as China are attempting to move beyond being a manufacturing assembler. The emergence of the knowledge economy in the PRD also has important implications for the recent efforts to develop the Greater Pearl River Delta, which needs {{to pay more attention to}} global networks for innovation and creativity. Moreover, the emergence of the knowledge economy makes the development of the periphery even more challenging due to {{the effects of}} self-reinforcing agglomeration and the constraints of geographical barriers.

40|$|A {{computational}} homogenization {{procedure for}} a material layer that possesses an underlying heterogeneous microstructure is introduced {{within the framework}} of finite deformations. The macroscopic material properties of the material layer are obtained from multiscale considerations. At the macro level, the layer is resolved as a cohesive interface situated within a continuum, and its underlying microstructure along the interface is treated as a continuous representative volume element of given height. The scales are linked via homogenization with customized hybrid boundary conditions on this representative volume element, which account for the deformation modes along the interface. A nested numerical solution scheme is adopted <b>to</b> <b>link</b> the <b>macro</b> and micro scales. Numerical examples successfully display the capability of the proposed approach to solve macroscopic boundary value problems with an evaluation of the constitutive properties of the material layer based on its micro-constitution. ...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} academic {{criticism of the}} international news coverage of Africa, but little or no first-hand research on the forces that create this news. This thesis draws on 51 semi-structured interviews and ethnographic work with practicing foreign correspondents in Sudan, Kenya and Uganda to explore the question: how can we explain and theorise the production of international news on East Africa? The thesis argues that Pierre Bourdieu’s Field Theory, and its analytical toolbox of ‘field’, ‘capital’ and ‘habitus’, can be meaningfully used to examine international journalistic practice. Field theory has been widely and productively used to understand domestic news production, {{but it has not}} yet been employed to empirically investigate journalistic production in the global sphere. The analysis is presented in three sections, each of which focuses on a different ‘layer’ of the international news system: the global field, where newswires compete for clients and capital; the national field ‘back home’ where traditional, nation based news outlets are based; and, finally, the local and immediate site where foreign correspondents work. Each of these layers is explored through an in depth case study of a major news producer/group of producers working in East Africa. The first and most substantial section examines the global journalistic field, and the position and practices of the Reuters newswire within this field. The second examines the foreign correspondents who report on Africa for print outlets in the UK. The final section presents two case studies of correspondents at work, negotiating a local news ecology: the election violence in Kenyan (2007 - 8), and the international coverage of the Darfur crisis. The discussion explores the fluidity between these three layers. Each analysis section stands alone as an investigations of major news producers in Africa today, and the forces that influence their work. Together, they build the argument that field theory is a useful approach to conceptualising the contemporary global news system, and examining journalistic practices within this. The main strengths of the theory lie in its notion of habitus; {{the extent to which it}} can incorporate and explain change; and its ability <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>macro</b> level phenomenon with micro level practice. The theory is ideally suited to capture and study the way in which foreign correspondents negotiate a complex and fluid global news system. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R

Communication technology and the international role for English suggest the integrating global communication reality is simplifying. Experience indicates integration produces complex heterogeneous dialogue and asymmetrical relationships with no shared interpretative systems. The global/national/local nexus presents management with universal and particular paradoxes mediated through diverse contextual micro communication practices and behaviours. This thesis derives from a professional service (environmental engineering) TNC request for help to address the business communication and performance concerns implicated {{in the production of}} professional bi-lingual English and Indonesian reports for clients. At the heart of this corporate concern lie the multicultural nature of interactions between the individuals, organizations and wider stakeholders involved in the Jakarta, Indonesian branch office operations. A developing nation adds further complexity. This thesis contends that these micro organizational concerns <b>link</b> <b>to</b> critical <b>macro</b> economic, political, and cultural societal concerns for the development of more responsive ethical and sustainable management and governance.

The maps {{can be used for}} regional policy analysis as they help in identifying areas where the rural poor live and where rural poverty is determined by the endowment and quality of natural resources and by population pressure. Natural resource endowment was assessed in the study by calculating an Agricultural Resource Index based on the availability of different major agricultural resources. Income per-capita was calculated by using census data, adjusted by the rural population density. The results show that the better income areas of Syria are located in the irrigated or higher-rainfall areas, but lower-income pockets exist due to the presence of various ecological and topographic factors. The study provides the elements of a 'top-down' approach for poverty mapping to disaggregate income from census sources to the pixel level based on agroecological data.

40|$|Municipal {{social policy}} has an {{important}} role in dealing with social problems of citizens. On micro level, municipalities spend a substantial amount of their budget solving such problems. However, increasing the amount of money spent on solving problems of each individual at micro level does not provide efficient fulfilment of the tasks defined for municipal social policy making. Thus new, complementary solutions should be looked into, as new ways of development of social work in municipalities should be designed with the aim to increase the level of citizen participation and joint responsibility, especially of socially vulnerable groups. Research results let the author conclude that social activity of socially vulnerable groups should be promoted by creating a series of prerequisites, among which citizen participation, need for organisational support, activities that would foster politician and municipality officials’ attitude towards citizen participation and their social capital increase, two-way relationship between citizens and officials, and the worker that would promote citizen participation, among which is social policy making, are considered to be very important.

40|$|During {{the unit}} event of {{material}} interaction in grinding, three phenomena are involved, namely, rubbing, ploughing and cutting, where ploughing and rubbing essentially mean the energy is being applied less efficiently {{in terms of}} material removal. Such phenomenon usually occurs before or after cutting. Based on this distinction, {{it is important to}} identify the effects of these different phenomena experienced during grinding. Acoustic emission (AE) of the material grit interaction is considered as the most sensitive monitoring process to investigate such miniscule material interactions. For this reason, two AE sensors were used to pick up energy signatures (one verifying the other) correlated to material measurements of the horizontal scratch groove profiles. Such material measurements would display both the material plastic deformation and material removal mechanisms. Previous work has only partially displayed the link in terms of micro and macro phenomena (unit event to normal MG events).
