5|$|After his death, Boniface's tomb was {{the center}} of a cult, and when the tomb was opened in 1580, his body was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> preserved. The tomb and effigy was {{destroyed}} in the French Revolution, his remains were reburied and a new tomb built in 1839. He was beatified by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839, and his feast day is 14 July.|$|E
5|$|Look, I'm sorry you're dead OK? I do care. But <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> {{honest with}} you, I don't care a lot. You had a choice, {{you took the}} drugs, you died. Are you seriously {{claiming}} no one warned you it was dangerous?... I mean, {{have you had a}} look at the world lately?... There's plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E
5|$|Regular Democrats {{were forced}} to call for {{annexation}} of Texas in their platform, {{but there was a}} bitter battle for the presidential nomination. Ballot after ballot, Van Buren failed to win the necessary super-majority of Democratic votes, and slowly fell in the rankings. It was not until the ninth ballot that the Democrats turned their sights to James K. Polk, a less prominent candidate who supported annexation. They found him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> suited for their platform, and he was nominated with two-thirds of the vote. Tyler considered his work vindicated, and implied in an acceptance letter that annexation was his true priority rather than election.|$|E

5|$|The writer Ratazyayev, who {{jokes about}} using Devushkin as a {{character}} {{in one of his}} stories offends him, but genuinely seems to like him. Eventually Devushkin's pride is assuaged and their friendship is restored. The Gorshkovs come into money because the father's case is won in court. With the generous settlement they seem to be destined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> happy, but the father dies, leaving his family in a shambles despite the money. Soon after this, Dobroselova announces that a rich man, Mr. Bykov who had dealings with Anna Fyodorovna and Pokrovsky's father, has proposed to her. She decides to leave with him, and the last few letters attest to her slowly becoming accustomed to her new money.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a meeting}} with {{attorneys}} on May 10, 1961 intended to resolve the dispute, Dave Guard resigned from the Kingston Trio, though pledging to fulfill group commitments through November of that year. Shane, Reynolds, and Werber bought out Guard's interest in the partnership for $300,000 to be paid {{over a number of}} years and moved to replace him immediately. The remaining Trio partners settled quickly on John Stewart, a 21-year-old member of the Cumberland Three, one of the myriad of groups that sprang up hoping to imitate the Kingston Trio's success. Stewart was already well-acquainted with Reynolds and Shane, having sold two of his early songwriting efforts to the Trio, and he was a proficient guitarist, banjoist, and singer who seemed to the partners <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> positioned to replace Guard. Stewart began rehearsing and recording with the group nearly immediately, commencing public appearances with the Trio in September 1961.|$|E
5|$|Ladas {{was then}} matched against Isinglass, the Triple Crown winner of 1893, in the £10,000 Princess of Wales's Stakes over one mile at Newmarket on 5 July. The race {{attracted}} {{a large crowd}} including the Prince of Wales (who supported Isinglass) and the Queen's cousin George, Duke of Cambridge (who favoured Ladas). The field also included Raeburn, the only horse to have beaten Isinglass, Ravensbury, who had won impressively at Royal Ascot, and Bullingdon, who had recovered from the bout of coughing that had reportedly affected him at Epsom. The early pace was slow, and Watts held Ladas up behind the leaders before moving into the lead just over a furlong out. He was immediately challenged, however, and overtaken inside the final furlong by both Isinglass and Bullingdon. Isinglass prevailed by a short head with Ladas, who was eased in the closing stages, finishing a well-beaten third. Ladas appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> sound after the race, and the only explanation offered (by The Sportsman) was that the slow pace (the winning time was 1:48.4) had produced a false result.|$|E

25|$|Promoted to captain on 30 June 1903, Oliver {{became the}} first {{commanding}} officer of his proposed new navigation school HMS Mercury in late 1903.

25|$|The {{following}} day, a {{young woman}} (Perkins) shoots her horse to death immediately outside of the camp. The sound of the gunshot temporarily sends the frightened Coley into hiding. Gashade examines the dead horse and notes that it appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> healthy. The woman offers Gashade a thousand dollars to lead her to a place called Kingsley. Although openly distrustful of her, he grudgingly accepts the offer. Coley, apparently smitten by the woman, accompanies them.|$|E
25|$|Distortions {{in visual}} {{perception}} during a temporal lobe seizure may include size distortion (micropsia or macropsia), distorted perception of movement (where moving objects {{may appear to}} be moving very slowly or <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> still), a sense that surfaces such as ceilings and even entire horizons are moving farther away in a fashion similar to the dolly zoom effect, and other illusions. Even when consciousness is impaired, insight into the hallucination or illusion is typically preserved.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the same}} logic, the new right/new left {{considers}} {{the killing of}} Chinese who were suspected of guerrilla activity <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> legal and valid, including some of those killed at Nanjing, for example. They also take the view that many Chinese civilian casualties resulted from the scorched earth tactics of the Chinese nationalists. Though such tactics are arguably legal, the new right/new left takes the position {{that some of the}} civilian deaths caused by these scorched earth tactics are wrongly attributed to the Japanese military.|$|E
25|$|Flashbulb memory {{occurs when}} a very vivid memory of a traumatic, emotional, or {{significant}} event is recalled. Researchers typically use public {{events such as the}} John F. Kennedy assassination and 9/11 as cues when studying flashbulb memories. Participants are asked to recall very specific information such as where they were, how they felt, and what they were doing when the event was taking place. Memories of these events are easily recalled and the individual believes their account of the event <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> accurate.|$|E
25|$|In 1907, Bishop Francis Silas Chatard, {{the first}} {{bishop of the}} Diocese of Indianapolis, {{requested}} that the body of Mother Theodore be exhumed and examined. Chatard, a medical doctor before becoming a priest, was hearing much about her heroic life and service {{to the people of}} the area. When the body was exhumed the brain was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> intact after 51 years in the grave. This phenomenon encouraged Chatard to introduce the Cause for Canonization, the long and thorough process of declaring saints in the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E

25|$|Perceptual priming {{is based}} on the form of the {{stimulus}} and is enhanced by the match between the early and later stimuli. Perceptual priming is sensitive to the modality and exact format of the stimulus. An example of perceptual priming is the identification of an incomplete word in a word-stem completion test. The presentation of the visual prime does not have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> consistent with later testing presentations in order to work. Studies have shown that, for example, the absolute size of the stimuli can vary and still provide significant evidence of priming.|$|E
25|$|Quebec French and European French {{tend to have}} entirely {{different}} Anglicisms for historical reasons. Quebec French acquired its Anglicisms in a gradual process of linguistic borrowing resulting from linguistic contact with English speakers {{for two and a}} half centuries since the Battle of the Plains of Abraham of 1759. European French, on the other hand, mostly adopted its Anglicisms in recent decades due to the post-Second World War international dominance of English, or the rise of English as a lingua franca. Due to the differences between in English borrowings in Canada and France, the people of Quebec and France often consider each other's anglicisms to be incorrect or humorous while considering their own <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> normal.|$|E
25|$|John's brother James was {{actively}} {{involved with the}} American side of Fraser's plant export-import business, and from at least 1791 they jointly leased some land in Charleston until May 1800. In 1796, the brothers additionally mortgaged 406 acres on Johns Island along the marshy edge of Stono River, originally {{a part of the}} Fenwick Hall estate. The brothers had difficulties with their land deals though, and in 1798 they fell behind in their payment obligations to the extent that their creditors instituted litigation to collect past due sums. Despite their problems with lawsuits, leases, mortgages, and land too marshy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> suited to their enterprise, in 1810, the year prior to Fraser's death, large numbers of rhododendrons, magnolias, and other native plants were still being shipped from the Fraser brothers' Charleston nursery by their agents there.|$|E
