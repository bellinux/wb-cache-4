5|$|The USCG cited topside damage as a {{reasonable}} alternative reason for Fitzgerald sinking and surmised that {{damage to the}} fence rail and vents was possibly caused by a heavy floating object such as a log. Historian and mariner Mark Thompson believes that something broke loose from Fitzgeralds deck. He theorized {{that the loss of}} the vents resulted in flooding of two ballast tanks or a ballast tank and a walking tunnel that caused the ship to list. Thompson further conjectured that damage more extensive than Captain McSorley could detect in the pilothouse let water flood the cargo hold. He concluded that <b>the</b> <b>topside</b> damage Fitzgerald experienced at 3:30p.m. on November 10, compounded by the heavy seas, was the most obvious explanation for why she sank.|$|E

5000|$|The {{floating}} platform was towed to Murmansk in Russia where <b>the</b> <b>topsides</b> facilities and main hull were de-mated. Subsequently <b>the</b> <b>topsides</b> were transported by barge to the Sevmash fabrication yard at Severodvinsk, {{where they were}} temporarily stored while undergoing refurbishment and refitting.|$|R
5000|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>topsides</b> modules were {{constructed}} locally, with some sourced internationally. The 550,000-ton slipform concrete GBS was built inside a drydock and mated with <b>the</b> <b>topsides</b> in <b>the</b> nearby deepwater construction site.

25|$|The {{origins of}} the Canadian upper {{atmosphere}} and space program {{can be traced back}} to the end of the Second World War. Between 1945 and 1960, Canada undertook a number of small launcher and satellite related projects under the aegis of defence research, including the development of the Black Brant rocket as well as series of advanced studies examining both orbital rendezvous and re-entry. In 1957, scientists and engineers at the Canadian Defence Research Telecommunications Establishment (DRTE) under the leadership of John H. Chapman embarked on a project initially known simply as S-27 or <b>the</b> <b>Topside</b> Sounder Project. This work would soon lead to the development of Canada's first satellite known as Alouette 1.|$|E
25|$|In June, 2012, Wison Offshore & Marine, a {{subsidiary}} to Wison Group, {{was awarded the}} contract to build the 'world's first floating LNG Liquefaction, Regasification, and Storage unit.' Referred to as a FLRSU, the production unit will be delivered to Exmar under a contract with Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. to start operation in Q4 2014 {{off the coast of}} Colombia. It will be a non-propelled barge, and will have a capacity of converting 69.5 MMcf/d of natural gas into LNG. It will be built in the Wison Offshore & Marine fabrication facility in Nantong, China.

25|$|The hull {{had been}} {{sheathed}} in three layers of lead sheeting {{to protect the}} timbers from shipworms; as there are none in fresh water lakes, this design feature was not only costly but useless. It {{is evidence that the}} ships hulls were constructed following standardized Roman shipbuilding techniques rather than being purpose-built. <b>The</b> <b>topside</b> timbers were protected by paint and tarred wool with many surfaces decorated with marble, mosaics and gilded copper roof tiles. There was a lack of coordination between the structure of the hull and that of the superstructures, which suggests that naval architects designed the hulls, while civil architects then designed the superstructure to use the space available after the hulls were completed. After their recovery, the ships hulls were found to be completely empty and unadorned.|$|E
25|$|On USS Atlanta, {{over 500}} {{high-speed}} cameras {{on the ship}} recorded {{the effects of the}} blast. During the tests, the ship was manned by a 169-man navy crew and 60 scientific personnel who remained below deck. In spite of <b>the</b> <b>topside</b> damage, the crew below deck experienced only a shock equivalent to a nine gun 16-inch salvo from an Iowa-class battleship. Had there been personnel in the superstructures, they would have been violently thrown about. Topside, the SPS-37 and SPS-10 antennas as well as the URD-4 radio direction finder were torn off by the blast, while other structures were severely deformed. The AN/SPG-51 Tartar guided missile radar was put out of operation for one hour. While the anti-submarine ASROC launcher and Mark 32 torpedo tubes were damaged, the rockets and Mark 44 and Mark 46 torpedoes inside were intact. The Mark 25 torpedo tube was severely damaged, aluminum casting cracked, hold down bolts elongated, the insulating blanket destroyed and the muzzle door sprung, but surprisingly, the tube remained operational. The tripod mast carrying electronics gear was destroyed and fell to the deck. On the blast side, components of the hardened deck house sustained a permanent 2 inch deflection. The entire DLG 16 deck-house between two levels was blown in after welds were ruptured.|$|E
500|$|The Type IXA {{submarines}} had six torpedo tubes (four {{in the bow}} and two in the stern) {{and carried}} a total of twenty-two [...] torpedoes. The torpedo warhead was between [...] and [...] These torpedoes could travel up to [...] and as fast as 44 knots (81km/h). Twelve torpedoes were stowed internally and ten were in <b>the</b> <b>topside</b> deck containers. In {{order to get the}} torpedoes into the forward or bow torpedo room, the torpedoes were lifted over the U-boat by a crane. The crew would then pull the torpedo inside the vessel using a cradle that was set at an angle to allow the torpedo to slide into position inside the torpedo room. To reload a torpedo tube with a torpedo from one of the above-deck canisters, the submarine would have to surface in calm water. Then the torpedo would be pulled out of the compartment with winches and lowered into the forward or bow torpedo room. This process could take several hours for just one torpedo, during which the U-boat was unable to dive, making it an easy target for Allied aircraft.|$|E

500|$|Between 13:20 and 14:15, {{the second}} and third waves of U.S. {{aircraft}} attacked, concentrating on Yamato. During this time, Yamato was hit by at least eight torpedoes and up to 15 bombs. The bombs did extensive damage to <b>the</b> <b>topside</b> of the ship, including knocking out power to the gun directors and forcing the anti-aircraft guns to be individually and manually aimed and fired, greatly reducing their effectiveness. The torpedo hits—almost all on the port side—caused Yamato to list enough that capsizing was now an imminent danger. The water damage-control station had been destroyed by a bomb hit making it impossible to counter-flood the specially designed spaces within the ship's hull to counteract hull damage. At 13:33, {{in a desperate attempt to}} keep the ship from capsizing, Yamatos damage control team counter-flooded both starboard engine and boiler rooms. This mitigated the danger but also drowned the several hundred crewmen manning those stations, who were given no notice that their compartments were about to fill with water. The loss of the starboard engines—plus the weight of the water—caused Yamato to slow to about [...] At that same moment, the Americans launched another 110 aircraft from Task Group 58. Twenty Avengers made a new torpedo run from 60 degrees to port. Yamato started a sharp turn to port but three torpedoes ripped into her port side amidships, jamming her auxiliary rudder in position hard port.|$|E

The drilling mast and substructure have a rated capacity of 1,300,000lbs {{and can be}} skidded to drill a well to the maximum depth of [...] through {{any of the four}} moon pools. Internally, the drilling unit can hold enough supplies to drill three to five wells depending on the well depth. In addition to drilling equipment, <b>the</b> <b>topside</b> includes two cranes, a helicopter platform, and accommodation for 90 workers.|$|E
