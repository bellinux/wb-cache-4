50|$|Extended {{biochemical}} {{tests have}} characterized P. penneri as being uniformly salicin negative. The inability to produce ornithine decarboxylase differentiates P. penneri from another indole-negative Proteus species, P.mirabilis. P. penneri isolates are not fermenters of salicin and not users of citrate, but acidify sucrose and maltose. Other chief characteristics {{of this species}} that enable its differentiation from other Proteus species include failure to acidify esculin, failure to produce hydrogen sulfide on <b>triple</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>iron</b> <b>agar,</b> and resistance to chloramphenicol. The resistance of P. penneri to cefuroxime and the marked inhibitory activity of cefoxitin against this species also distinguishes P. penneri from the other Proteus. Similar to other Proteus species, P. penneri has a cell-bound hemolytic factor, which {{has been shown to}} facilitate penetration of the organism into cultured Vero cells without any cytotoxic effects. It also has a filterable cytotoxic alpha-hemolysin rarely found in other Proteus species. A highly active urease produced by P. penneri may also have a role in the establishment of an infectious process.|$|E

40|$|Bile-esculin agar {{has been}} used for several years for the {{presumptive}} identification of group D streptococci. All members of the Enterobacteriaceae family will also grow on this medium, but only certain ones can hydrolyze esculin to 6, 7 -dihydroxycoumarin, which reacts with iron to produce a characteristic blackening of the medium. One thousand and six cultures from clinical specimens representing 20 genera were isolated and identified. Heavy inocula from fresh pure culture isolates on heart infusion agar were placed on bile-esculin agar slants and incubated at 35 C. The slants were examined at 4 h and again at 18 h for esculin hydrolysis. Shigella, Salmonella, Arizona, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Providencia alcalifaciens, and Providencia stuartii all produced negative results. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Serratia rubidaea produced a positive reaction in 4 h. The other remaining eight genera exhibited varying results.

40|$|To {{know the}} {{relation}} between NaCl concentration and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) production by MY Phenomenon of Salmonella, we developed a method to control H 2 S production by Salmonella in this study. Desoxycholate-hydrogen sulfide-lactose (DHL) agar {{was used as the}} selective medium for Salmonella. <b>Triple</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>iron</b> (TSI) <b>agar</b> was used as the screening medium. Citric acid disks were placed on DHL agar. NaCl was added to both media. After 24 hours incubation, H 2 S produc-tion on DHL agar was stimulated by citric acid, whereas production was suppressed by adding NaCl. The color change {{in the bottom of the}} TSI medium was due to the low production of black FeS. The production of FeS was reduced by lower H 2 S production by Salmonella with an increasing concentration of NaCl from 0. 5 % to 3 %. The inhibition of the black color meant that the color change due to glucose fermentation could be seen clearly in the bottom of the agar. The current method cannot detect glucose fermentation but the addition of more NaCl to the TSI medium al-lowed the visualization of glucose fermentation by Salmonella.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{honeybee}} colonies has consistently been declining since {{the winter of}} 2006. The reason for this loss, which has been coined Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), is not known. In this experiment, the culturable bacterial flora of the honeybee gut was examined to provide {{more information on the}} natural microbial populations of the honeybee. Since little data exists on the normal flora of the honeybee gut, being able to identify the normal flora could aid in identifying microbes associated with CCD. Honeybee gut content was extracted and cultured on standard microbiological media. Once bacteria were isolated, the microbe types were isolated for further analysis and characterization by biochemical and biophysical tests. Biochemical reactions were done on MacConkey and <b>Triple</b> <b>Sugar</b> <b>Iron</b> (TSI) <b>agar</b> and while spectral profiles were collected using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF). All bacteria were found to have a rod morphology, with five being Gram-positive and two Gram-negative. One organism was found to be a yeast. MALDI-TOF displayed that four colony types had similar but unique mass spectrometry profiles.

Five of these seven were not stimulated by arginine and are designated “phenotypically similar organisms. ” Thin-layer chromatography of extracted spent bacterial medium of four representative strains from each group grown in the presence of cholate revealed the presence of (A) 12 -oxo product, (B) 12 -oxo and 3 -oxo products, (C) 3 -oxo product, and (D) the absence of any of these products. The 12 α-HSDHase of category B organisms was unstable unless 10 − 3 M dithioerythritol was added to the buffer.
