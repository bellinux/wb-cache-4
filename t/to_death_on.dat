5|$|A man, Cutter (Pablo Coffey), visits an {{open house}} viewing, where he is given a tour by the estate agent, and seems to take an {{interest}} in the bedroom of a young girl. That night, the owners have returned home, and are settling down for the evening when their daughter, Patricia, begins screaming. Later, a security guard for the family's alarm company finds the bodies of the parents hacked <b>to</b> <b>death</b> <b>on</b> the first floor, but Patricia is nowhere to be seen.|$|E
5|$|As he {{was closely}} {{associated}} with the court of Charles I, Hare's fortunes went into decline during the English Civil War. His castle at Longford and his house in Totteridge were seized by Parliamentary forces, and returned upon the Restoration in a severe state of disrepair. Records of Tottenham from the period are now lost, and the ownership and condition of the Lordship House during the Commonwealth of England are unknown. Hugh Hare died at his home in Totteridge in 1667, having choked <b>to</b> <b>death</b> <b>on</b> a bone eating turkey while laughing and drinking, and was succeeded by his son Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine.|$|E

5|$|Chandler {{was found}} guilty of the murders, and was sentenced <b>to</b> <b>death</b> <b>on</b> November 4, 1994. He {{maintained}} his innocence, and continued to pursue legal appeals while on Florida's Death Row. He admitted to the Madeira Beach incident but said the sex was consensual, and that the victim changed her mind during the act. Since Chandler had already been sentenced to death for the Rogers family murders, and prosecutors did not want to subject Blair to the emotional trauma of a rape trial, he was never prosecuted for Blair's rape.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer's role in {{politics}} was diminishing when on 16 October 1551 Seymour {{was arrested on}} charges of treason. In December he was put on trial and although acquitted of treason, he was judged guilty of felony and put <b>to</b> <b>death</b> <b>on</b> 22 January 1552. This {{was the beginning of}} the breach between Cranmer and Dudley. It was aggravated during the year by the gradual appropriation of ecclesiastical property by the regency. However, even throughout this political turmoil, Cranmer worked simultaneously on three major projects in his reform programme: the revision of canon law, the revision of the Prayer Book, and the formation of a statement of doctrine.|$|E
5|$|Every few weeks, the Nazis {{staged a}} roundup in the Lvov ghetto of people unable to work. These roundups {{typically}} took place while the able-bodied were absent doing forced labour. In one such deportation, Wiesenthal's mother and other elderly Jewish women were transported by freight train to Belzec extermination camp {{and killed in}} August 1942. Around the same time, a Ukrainian policeman shot Cyla's mother <b>to</b> <b>death</b> <b>on</b> {{the front porch of}} her home in Buczacz while she was being evicted. Cyla and Simon Wiesenthal lost 89 relatives during the Holocaust.|$|E

5|$|The British {{held two}} major trials against the top German war criminals who had perpetrated crimes during the Italian campaign. For {{political}} reasons {{it was decided}} to hold the trials in Italy, but a request by Italy to allow an Italian judge to participate was denied on the grounds that Italy was not an Allied country. The trials were held under the Royal Warrant of 18 June 1945, thus under British Military Law. The decision put the trials on a shaky legal basis, as foreign nationals were being tried for crimes against foreigners in a foreign country. The first trial, held in Rome, was of Mackensen and Mälzer for their part in the Ardeatine massacre. Both were sentenced <b>to</b> <b>death</b> <b>on</b> 30 November 1946.|$|E
5|$|The French {{started their}} rule by {{sentencing}} 21 nationalist leaders, including Quwatli, <b>to</b> <b>death</b> <b>on</b> 1 August 1920. Quwatli managed to flee only hours before {{a warrant for}} his arrest was issued. From Damascus he fled by car to Haifa in British-mandated Palestine, and soon after to Cairo in Egypt. From there, Quwatli spent {{the bulk of his}} time traveling throughout the Arab world and Europe serving as the virtual ambassador of the Syrian-Palestinian Congress. He became the chief link between Arab nationalist activists in Europe and in the Arab world.|$|E
5|$|The Russian army withdrew {{and retreated}} past Moscow. Napoleon entered the city, {{assuming}} its fall {{would end the}} war and Alexander would negotiate peace. However, on orders of the city's governor Feodor Rostopchin, rather than capitulation, Moscow was burned. After five weeks, Napoleon and his army left. In early November Napoleon got concerned about loss of control back in France after the Malet coup of 1812. His army walked through snow up to their knees and nearly 10,000 men and horses froze <b>to</b> <b>death</b> <b>on</b> the night of 8/9 November alone. After the Battle of Berezina Napoleon managed to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train. On 5 December, shortly before arriving in Vilnius, Napoleon left the army in a sledge.|$|E

5|$|Unable {{to remain}} in one place long enough to receive provisions, Black Hawk's group were in poor health {{and some of them}} starved <b>to</b> <b>death</b> <b>on</b> the road. Black Hawk stated in his account of the battle that {{at this point in the}} war he had every {{intention}} of escaping with his people back across the Mississippi River, but on encountering the large U.S. force at Wisconsin Heights he was left with no choice but to fight. His intention was to allow the non-combatants in his band to escape across the Wisconsin River.|$|E
5|$|Between July 1 and July 12, 1916, {{five people}} were {{attacked}} {{along the coast}} of New Jersey by sharks; only one of the victims survived. The first major attack occurred on Saturday, July 1 at Beach Haven, a resort town established on Long Beach Island off the southern coast of New Jersey. Charles Epting Vansant, 25, of Philadelphia was on vacation at the Engleside Hotel with his family. Before dinner, Vansant decided to take a quick swim in the Atlantic with a Chesapeake Bay Retriever that was playing on the beach. Shortly after entering the water, Vansant began shouting. Bathers believed he was calling to the dog, but a shark was actually biting Vansant's legs. He was rescued by lifeguard Alexander Ott and bystander Sheridan Taylor, who claimed the shark followed him to shore as they pulled the bleeding Vansant from the water. Vansant's left thigh was stripped of its flesh; he bled <b>to</b> <b>death</b> <b>on</b> the manager's desk of the Engleside Hotel at 6:45p.m.|$|E
5|$|In May 1965, a {{military}} tribunal under Kỳ sentenced both Thảo and Phát, {{who were still}} on the run, to death in absentia. As a result, Thảo {{had little choice but to}} move around indefinitely or attempt to seize power in order to save himself. He chose the latter. On May 20, a few officers and around 40 civilians, predominantly Catholic, were arrested on charges of attempting to assassinate Quát and kidnap Kỳ among others. Several of the arrested were known supporters of Thảo and believed to be abetting him in evading the authorities. In July 1965, he was reported dead in unclear circumstances after being hunted down; an official report claimed he died of injuries while on a helicopter taking him to Saigon, after being captured north of the city. It was generally assumed he was murdered or tortured <b>to</b> <b>death</b> <b>on</b> the orders of some junta members. Phát remained on the run for three years. During that time, Kỳ's power was eclipsed by Thiệu in a continuing power struggle, and the latter removed Kỳ supporters in the military from positions of high power. In June 1968, Phát came out of hiding and surrendered himself to the authorities. He was pardoned by {{a military}} court in August and released.|$|E

5|$|In {{the present}} day, Walt's partner Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) has just shot Gale <b>to</b> <b>death</b> <b>on</b> orders from Walt to foil Gus' plot {{to kill and}} replace them. Gus' henchman Victor (Jeremiah Bitsui) arrives at Gale's {{apartment}} and finds him dead, surrounded by neighbors who have just called the police. Victor finds a stunned Jesse sitting in his car outside and forces him at gunpoint {{to return to the}} meth lab, where Gus' employee Mike (Jonathan Banks) is holding Walt hostage. Mike, who is concerned that Victor was seen by bystanders at the murder scene, calls to inform Gus of the events. Victor, who has often watched Walt work, starts cooking meth himself to prove they do not need him or Jesse. Walt grows concerned when Victor proves better at the process than he expected.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Munch and Kellerman {{investigate}} a murder at Oriole Park at Camden Yards during a late-season baseball game, leaving 48,000 possible suspects. The Long Island man, presumably a Yankees fan, is found beaten <b>to</b> <b>death</b> <b>on</b> {{the stairs of}} the stadium, and the governor of Maryland pressures the police department to solve the murder before the game ends so that millions in tourism dollars and ticket revenues will not be jeopardized. After several fruitless interviews, Munch and Kellerman question Scott Russell (Brian Tarantina), a New Yorker who attended the game with the victim. Russell admits he killed the victim because he said the Baltimore Orioles were a better team than the Yankees. He agrees to confess to the murder if they let him watch {{the rest of the}} game. Back at the police department, Falsone continues questioning detectives about the Luther Mahoney shooting. Stivers expresses concern to Lewis that their covering for Kellerman's role in the shooting could bring both of them down if Falsone continues his questioning.|$|E
5|$|One of Frederick III's bodyguards, Statius, {{traveled}} to Scania {{to organize the}} peasants into Snapphane units and instigate anti-Swedish sentiment. In Malmö, a cabal of rich bourgeoisie, led by Bartholomaeus Mikkelsen, planned a revolt. The conspiracy tried to recruit one of Malmös two mayors, Efvert Wiltfang, {{but he would not}} commit himself to the uprising, even though he said he would support Frederick III. At the end of December, the Danes embarked on a foray into Scania, but were foiled by bad weather and poor navigation. Meanwhile, the Swedish authorities had become aware of the plot and the main leaders were arrested, among them Mikkelsen and Wildfang, and the conspirators were sentenced <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> <b>On</b> December 22, 1659 Mikkelsen and two others were beheaded, but in an attempt to placate the Scanian people the execution of Wiltfang and 10 others was stayed. The uprising had been averted, but rebels and insurgents continued to operate in the countryside.|$|E
