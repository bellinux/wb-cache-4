5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} had it {{that the}} Persian king (who at the time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty in <b>the</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the Eurymedon.

The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted {{as if he had}} made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful of engaging in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in <b>the</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> Eurymedon.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 65 - 68). This paper {{explores the}} {{varying degrees of}} trauma, and its aftermath, within literature in the British modern period. Utilizing the works of Katherine Mansfield, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, and D. H.

Despite <b>the</b> inclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aftermaths</b> <b>of</b> trauma within these texts, the authors are unable to successfully communicate the point of trauma within their works, which indicates an inability to recognize or cope with the trauma itself...|$|R
