5|$|For Browne and the Associated Press (AP), <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> a {{marketing}} success. Ray Herndon, the United Press International (UPI) correspondent who {{had forgotten to}} take his camera on the day, was harshly criticized in private by his employer. UPI estimated that 5,000 readers in Sydney, then a city of around 1.5–2 million, had switched to AP news sources.|$|E
5|$|Another aspect {{that the}} GAO {{investigation}} revealed {{was that the}} training F-15 pilots received for identifying helicopters was not adequate. Visual ID training was accomplished by reviewing slides on a 35mm projector. Helicopters only made up about 5% of the training slides and nearly all the pictures depicted helicopters from the ground looking up because <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> provided by the U.S. Army. Investigators also learned from interviewing other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not regarded as an important skill within the F-15 pilot community because helicopters are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.|$|E

5|$|John F. Kennedy and {{his running}} mate, Lyndon B. Johnson, {{were close to}} {{securing}} their spots on the Democrats' ticket when they took a two-day swing through the Dallas–Fort Worth area in September 1960. Landing at Meacham Airport, the candidates rode in a motorcade through Dallas to the Chance Vought Aircraft factory, where Kennedy made an address. Grant accompanied Kennedy and Johnson, making numerous photographs of the trip; <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> developed, but kept in storage until their publication in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Kapoor's {{personal}} {{life is the}} subject of fervent tabloid reporting in India. During the filming of Fida in 2004, he began dating Kareena Kapoor and they both publicly spoke of the relationship. They were involved in a well-publicised scandal when Mid Day published a set of pictures of them kissing in public. Despite claims by the couple that <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> fabricated, the newspaper denied any wrongdoing. The couple separated in 2007 during the filming of Jab We Met. Since their split, Kapoor decided to keep his {{personal life}} away from media attention. However, tabloids speculated on his relationship with several other actresses, including Vidya Balan and Priyanka Chopra.|$|E

50|$|The rest of {{the book}} {{consists}} of Basil Pao's photographs, each with a short text indicating what <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> about and where it was taken. Some of <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> displayed as impressive two-page spreads. A majority of <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> show <b>the</b> local people, some as informal portraits, some showing people engaged in various activities. The rest of <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> beautiful landscapes, many depicting the harsh yet fascinating desert.|$|R

25|$|The Japanese {{government}} used fumi-e {{to reveal}} practicing Catholics and sympathizers. Fumi-e were {{pictures of the}} Virgin Mary or Christ.

If they refused to renounce their religion, they were tortured; those who still refused were executed.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} edition cover depicts Shishido with crow feathers in her hair, {{while the}} limited edition version features a crow with a long, black wig {{in the style}} of Shishido's hair. <b>The</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> shot by photographer , and the photo shoot was intended as a self-introduction, due to Shishido being associated with crows.|$|E
25|$|While {{on holiday}} in Las Vegas in August 2012, Harry and an unknown young woman were photographed naked in a Wynn Las Vegas hotel room, {{reportedly}} {{during a game}} of strip billiards. <b>The</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> leaked by American celebrity website TMZ on 21 August 2012, and reported worldwide by mainstream media on 22 August 2012. The photographs were shown by the American media but British media were reluctant to publish them – royal aides suggested that Clarence House would contact the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) if <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> used by British publications. St James's Palace confirmed that Harry was in the photographs, {{saying that he was}} essentially a victim whose privacy had been invaded, and contacted the Press Complaints Commission upon hearing that a number of British newspapers were considering publishing the photographs. On 24 August 2012, The Sun newspaper published the photographs.|$|E
50|$|One way a zograscope enhances depth {{perception}} is by minimizing other depth cues that specify the flatness and pictorial nature of <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> <b>The</b> image <b>is</b> magnified, perhaps {{giving it a}} visual angle similar to the real scene <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> depicting. <b>The</b> edges of <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>are</b> blocked by <b>the</b> frame of the lens. The light coming from the lens to the eye is collimated, preventing accommodation.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> {{painted in}} tempera on an oak panel covered with {{stretched}} canvas.

25|$|At a friend's suggestion, Price had {{professional}} {{photographs taken}} {{and decided to}} pursue a modelling career. <b>The</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> sent to a modelling agency in London, and in 1996 she appeared in Page 3, a topless female glamour model pictorial in British tabloid newspaper The Sun. She adopted the name Jordan in 1996 and made frequent appearances as a model on both Page Three and in men's lifestyle magazines.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> widely derided—"A pot {{of paint}} has been flung {{in the face}} of the public", {{declared}} the critic Camille Mauclair (1872–1945)—they also attracted some favorable attention. The painting that was singled out for the most attacks was Matisse's Woman with a Hat; the purchase of this work by Gertrude and Leo Stein had a very positive effect on Matisse, who was suffering demoralization from the bad reception of his work.|$|E
25|$|When {{we hear a}} car honk, {{we would}} {{determine}} which car triggers the honk by which car we see is the spatially closest to the honk. It's a spatial congruent example by combining visual and auditory stimuli. On the other hand, {{the sound and the}} pictures of a TV program would be integrated as structural congruent by combining visual and auditory stimuli. However, if the sound and <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> not meaningfully fit, we would segregate the two stimuli. Therefore, whether spatial or structural congruent should not only combine the stimuli but also be determined by understanding.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> {{painted in}} oil on canvas. It was {{inspired}} by the round shapes that marked the return of the artist to orphism and study of harmony in painting. Its dimensions are 145 x 113 cm. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> part of <b>the</b> collection of the Centre Georges Pompidou.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> {{taken at}} 4:06 pm local time in Washington (16:06 EST), which was 12:36 am local time in Afghanistan. President Obama later said he {{believed}} <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> taken about <b>the</b> time the room's occupants were informed or realized {{that one of the}} raid's helicopters had crashed.|$|R

25|$|The {{investigating}} teams seized erotic literature {{along with}} a laptop computer connected to a webcam, which immediately raised the apprehensions {{of the presence of}} an international child pornography racket. The police also recovered some photographs of Pandher with nude children and foreigners during his four international visits, which was later discovered to be untrue. It was alleged that Pandher supplied such pictures abroad and could link him to paedophilia. Later during the investigation it was found the nude children in <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> Pandher's grandchildren. There was no link found to child pornography. The laptop and the webcam were later returned to the family, and the story was classified as a media created rumour.|$|E
25|$|President of the Photography club. She is {{cheerful and}} {{energetic}} and is {{constantly on the}} lookout for any good photo opportunities which causes her to regularly come into contact with the disciplinary committee and/or the student council. She {{and the members of the}} photography club run an underground website that sells voyeuristic pictures of the school's female students online by using the club's all-female members to take candid pictures of other students or set up hidden cameras in the toilets and changing rooms but Honoka later reveals that some of <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> faked by using the club's members as models and then photo-shopping other students' faces. The site is taken down by the student council after Ui destroys the SD card that contains all their files.|$|E
25|$|Being an avid Francophile, of English ancestry, and {{strongly}} anti-Germany, Hassam enthusiastically backed the Allied cause {{and the protection}} of French culture. The Hassams joined with other artists in the war relief effort from nearly the beginning of the conflict in 1914, when most Americans as well as President Woodrow Wilson were decidedly isolationist. Hassam even considered volunteering to record the war in Europe, but the government would not approve the trip. He was even arrested (and quickly released) for innocently sketching naval maneuvers along the city's rivers. In addition to the time he gave to many committees, several of his flag pictures were contributed to the war relief in exchange for Liberty Bonds. Although he had great hopes that the entire series would sell as a war memorial set (for $100,000), <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> sold individually after several group exhibitions, the last at the Corcoran Gallery in 1922.|$|E
