25|$|The South {{has become}} solidly Republican in {{national}} elections since 1980, {{and has been}} trending Republican {{at the state level}} since then at a slower pace. In 2004, Bush led Kerry by 70%–30% among Southern whites, who made up 71% of the Southern electorate. Kerry had a 70–30 lead among the 29% of the voters who were black or Hispanic. One-third of these Southern voters said they were white evangelicals; <b>they</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> Bush by 80–20; but were only 72% Republican in 2006.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} days of Italian immigration, Boston Italians tended to vote Democratic.

From 1920 to 1940 they voted consistently, overwhelmingly, Democratic. In 1924, Democratic candidates for Congress and the Massachusetts senate received about 90% of the Italian vote. During this period there was a massive push by the Democratic party to mobilize new voters. Between 1924 and 1940, the number of male voters in the North End tripled, and the number of female voters increased eightfold.|$|E

25|$|The Germans {{operated}} {{parochial schools}} primarily {{to maintain their}} religious faith; often they offered only an hour of German language instruction a week, but they always had extensive coverage of religion. Most German Catholic children by 1910 attended schools taught entirely in English. In the 199x–1930 era, German Catholics generally voted for the Liberal ticket (rather than the Provincial Rights and Conservative tickets), seeing Liberals as more willing to protect religious minorities. Occasionally <b>they</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> Conservatives or independent candidates who offered greater support for public funding of parochial schools. Nazi Germany made a systematic effort to proselytize among Saskatchewan's Germans in the 1930s. Fewer that 1% endorsed their message, but some did migrate back to Germany before anti-Nazi sentiment became overwhelming in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Iris {{sailed to}} neutral Spain, {{arriving}} at Barcelona on the 28th.

Degé contacted the French Consul General, who was unable to assist them in procuring any more food and fuel (of which they were desperately short) or gaining any extension to the deadline. After contacting the French Naval Attaché at Madrid the crew of Iris was offered a simple choice; internment or scuttling. <b>They</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> internment. The crew were held at the prison camp at Miranda de Ebro, while a Spanish crew under the supervision of Degé and Enseigne de vaisseau Robert Lagane maintained the submarine.|$|E
25|$|The Republican administrations of President Richard Nixon (1969–74) and Gerald Ford (1974–77) were {{characterized}} by their emphasis on détente and on economic intervention through wage and price controls. Ford angered conservatives by continuing Henry Kissinger as Secretary of State and pushing his policy of détente with the Soviet Union. Conservatives finally found a new champion in Ronald Reagan, whose 8 years as governor of California had just ended in 1976, and supported his campaign for the Republican nomination. Ford narrowly won renomination but lost the White House. Following major gains by Democratic liberals in the 1974 midterm election, Jimmy Carter was elected as President. Carter proved too liberal for his fellow Southern Baptists, (as <b>they</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> him in 1976 but not 1980), too conservative for the mainstream of the Democratic Party, and many considered his foreign policy a failure. Carter realized {{there was a strong}} national sense of malaise, as inflation skyrocketed, interest rates soared, the economy stagnated, and prolonged humiliation resulted when Islamic militants in Tehran kept American diplomats hostage for 444 days in 1979–81.|$|E

[...] Although Ohio had voted for Lincoln in 1860, the Cincinnati voters turned against the Republican party after secession.

500|$|Gernsback's new magazine, Amazing Stories, was successful, but Gernsback {{lost control}} of the {{publisher}} when it went bankrupt in February 1929. By April he had formed a new company, Gernsback Publications Incorporated, and created two subsidiaries: Techni-Craft Publishing Corporation and Stellar Publishing Corporation. Gernsback sent out letters advertising his plans for new magazines; the mailing lists he used almost certainly were compiled from the subscription lists of Amazing Stories. This would have been illegal, as the lists were owned by Irving Trust, the receiver of the bankruptcy. Gernsback denied using the lists under oath, but historians have generally agreed that he must have done so. The letters also asked potential subscribers to decide the name of the new magazine; <b>they</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> [...] "Science Wonder Stories", which became the name of one of Gernsback's new magazines.|$|E

This victory again emboldened Republicans in the General Assembly, who nominated Bradley for {{a seat in the}} U.S. Senate in 1908. The Democrats {{countered by}} nominating outgoing Governor Beckham. Though the Democrats had a majority in the General Assembly, seven Democratic legislators refused to vote for Beckham because he favored Prohibition. Instead, <b>they</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> other candidates, leaving no one with a majority. As balloting continued over the course of two months with no winner, some Democrats urged Beckham to withdraw in favor of a more palatable candidate. He refused, and after twenty-nine ballots, four Democrats who favored Bradley's [...] "wet" [...] position defied allegiance to their party, electing him by a 64–60 margin.

500|$|After {{returning}} to Australia, Miller played against Bradman in a testimonial match in 1948–49. Miller bowled three consecutive bouncers at Bradman, dismissing {{him with the}} last of the short-pitched deliveries for 53. Bradman was angered by Miller's bowling. One week later, the squad to tour South Africa in the following season was announced, and Miller was omitted, despite being ranked as the best all rounder in the world. During the Australian season, which was a purely domestic one, he had scored 400runs at 33.33 and taken 11wickets at 24.09. He scored one century against Queensland during the season, as well as a 99 against Victoria at the SCG. The surprise omission led to much conjecturing about the reasoning. One was that Miller had stated during the season {{that he did not want}} to bowl, so the selectors only considered his batting performances. Another was that Miller's bouncing of Bradman had provoked his former captain into voting against him at the selection table. Rumours circulated that new captain Lindsay Hassett did not want Miller on the tour because he was undisciplined, which Hassett denied. Another was that Jack Ryder, the Victorian selector and former Australian captain, had voted against Miller in retaliation for his move to New South Wales. Both Bradman and Chappie Dwyer claimed <b>they</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> Miller, leading Miller to quip [...] "somebody's telling lies", as there were only three on the selection panel.|$|E
