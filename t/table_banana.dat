40|$|This {{experiment}} {{aimed to}} find out the effect of basal thickness of mulched materials on the growth and fruiting performance of <b>table</b> <b>banana</b> (Latundan var.). The experimental field was a portion of an existing <b>table</b> <b>banana</b> plantation. It was laid out using Randomized Complete Block Designwith three replications. The four treatments were designated as follows: T 0 (control - no mulch applied); T 1 (applied with 15 -cm thick mulch); T 2 (applied with 30 -cm thick mulch); and T 3 (applied with 45 -cm thick mulch). Results showed that <b>table</b> <b>banana</b> clumps mulched with organic materials at 30 -cm thick appeared most favorable with the highest increase in plant height (319 cm) and number of suckers produced (4. 25). The highest weight of fruit bunch and fruit hand were obtained by plants mulched at 45 -cm thick with weights of 6. 64 kg and 0. 87 kg, respectively. The above findings were statistically significant from the control treatment...|$|E
40|$|Shoot tips of a {{traditional}} <b>table</b> <b>banana</b> [Musa sp. cv. Kanthali (Genome AAB) ] of Bangladesh were evaluated for in vitro propagation. Initial surface sterilization (with 0. 1 % HgCl 2 for 12 min) of shoot tips was successful but microbial contamination (mostly bacteria) at the rhizomatous base of the explants were observed within 6 - 15 days after inoculation which eventually killed 85 % inoculated explants. So, for contamination free culture establishment explants were soaked in two broad spectrum antibiotics namely ampicillin and gentamicin. Cent percent contamination free cultures were established by soaking the explants in 400 mg L - 1 ampicillin or 200 mg L - 1 gentamicin for 1 h. Antibiotic treated explants {{were found to be}} full contamination free but failed to regenerate after 3 weeks of culture. But some of them absorbed media for up to 2 nd subculture and showed swelling of explants and some color changes from pale white to light/deep green. Finally, a few days after 3 rd subculture, no growth of explants was observed and all treated explants eventually started to die. Among the untreated alive explants the best medium for single shoot development was MS + 4. 0 mg L - 1 BA + 0. 5 mg L - 1 Kn + 15 % CW and average time required for shoot development was 18 - 21 days. But the regeneration percentage was very low (30 %). The best medium for shoot multiplication was MS + 4. 0 mg L - 1 BA + 2. 0 mg L - 1 IAA + 15 % CW and average time required for production of multiple shoots from single shoot was 40 - 45 days. Multiplication rate was also too low (40 %) and only average 3 - 4 shoots were formed. Finally, in vitro proliferated shoots produced roots with maximum frequency (90 %) in half strength of MS medium fortified with 0. 5 mg L - 1 IBA...|$|E

50|$|Kouklia {{receives}} {{average annual}} rainfall of about 420 mm. Grapes (wine-making and <b>table</b> varieties), <b>bananas,</b> various citrus fruits, avocados, apricots, kiwis, olives, locust beans, legumes, peanuts, {{and a large}} variety of vegetables are cultivated on the village's fertile land. The Randi Forest in the south-east as well {{as part of the}} Oriti Forest in the north-east fall within Kouklia's administrative boundaries. Animal husbandry is well developed in the community. Palm trees are planted in the main-street {{at the entrance to the}} village.|$|R
40|$|The best {{medium for}} single shoot {{development}} to obtain contamination free {{culture of the}} <b>table</b> <b>bananas</b> Musa sapientum cv. chini champa and sagar was MS + 4. 0 mg/l BAP + 1. 0 mg/l Kn. Average time required for shoot development was 15 - 21 days. The best medium for shoot multiplication was MS + 4. 0 mg/l BAP + 2. 0 mg/l IAA + 13 % CW and average time required for production of multiple shoots from single shoot was 40 - 45 days. Half strength MS + 2. 0 mg/l IBA was best for root induction in the regenerated shoots. Although initially surface sterilization was successful, microbial contamination {{at the base of}} the explant was observed within 7 - 15 days after inoculation which eventually killed the explants. Endogenous microorganisms, mostly bacteria, were observed under microscope. Altogether seven bacterial strains were isolated from the contaminated culture. Four of them were found to be gram positive and the rest were gram negative. The gram positive strains were Cellulomonas uda, C. flavigena, Corynebacterium paurometabolum and Bacillus megaterium. The gram negative strains were identified as Klebsiella sp., Erwinia cypripedii and Pseudomonas sp. All the strains were found to be susceptible to gentamicin. Cent per cent contamination free cultures were obtained by soaking the explants in 160 mg/l gentamicin for one hr and 40 min...|$|R
50|$|Since 2011, Costa {{has been}} {{undertaking}} a strategic transformation program focused on increasing its scale and vertical integration within its portfolio and reinvesting {{in the business}} to refresh core assets and fund growth. Expansion initiatives have included {{the development of the}} berry and sweet snacking tomato categories organically, the acquisition of Adelaide Mushrooms (a mushroom producer with operations in South Australia and Tasmania) and additions to its citrus footprint through the entry into long term leases of ex-Timbercorp orchards in 2011. In addition, the formation of the African Blue JV in Morocco in 2007 and the entry in 2014 into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Driscollâ€™s for the formation of a farming joint venture in China have enabled Costa to grow its international interests. In connection with this strategic transformation program, Costa has exited categories such as leafy vegetables, potatoes and stone fruit, as well as downsized non-core operations including <b>table</b> grapes, <b>bananas</b> and logistics.|$|R
