5|$|The Bristol and Exeter Railway amalgamated {{with the}} GWR on 1 January 1876. It {{had already made}} a start on mixing the gauge on its line, a task {{completed}} through to Exeter on 1 March 1876 by the GWR. The station here had been shared with the LSWR since 1862. This rival company had continued to push westwards over its Exeter and Crediton line and arrived in Plymouth later in 1876, which spurred the South Devon Railway to also amalgamate with the Great Western. The Cornwall Railway remained a nominally independent line until 1889, although the GWR held {{a large number of}} shares in the company. One final new broad-gauge route was opened on 1 June 1877, the St Ives branch in west Cornwall, although there was also a small extension at Sutton Harbour in Plymouth in 1879. Part of a mixed gauge point remains at Sutton Harbour, one of the few examples of broad gauge <b>trackwork</b> remaining in situ anywhere.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the next}} several months, <b>trackwork</b> {{proceeded}} south from Little pipe creek thru Bruceville (now known as Keymar), then on to Woodsboro, and then in August, 1872 <b>trackwork</b> had been completed through Woodsboro and onto towards Walkersville, then at a point 3 miles south of Woodsboro. On September 28, 1872 the track was finished {{as far as the}} north side of 8th or North Street at the head of Love Lane or East Street in Frederick city. Local citizens were offered rides on the newly completed line, noting the good substantial bridges over the Monocacy & Tuscorora built of iron.|$|E

25|$|The {{extensive}} <b>trackwork</b> at the Alice exchange sidings (near Crossgates) {{were all}} of mixed gauge. Trouble was experienced with the mixed gauge points, and some were converted to a type where the approach rails were shifted to meet the lead rails, so {{that there were no}} switch rails at all.|$|E
25|$|Further {{modifications}} {{were planned}} to waterfront <b>trackwork</b> in 1982 when the Department notified the Harbour Board that it intended to remove rail access to No. 1 Breastwork. In a missive from the Chief Civil Engineer to the District Engineer on 28 August 1984, {{it was noted}} that wharf no. 2 had been disconnected, and that only wharves 3 and 7 retained operable rail connections.|$|E
25|$|Modern track {{typically}} uses hot-rolled steel with {{a profile}} of an asymmetrical rounded I-beam. Unlike some other uses of iron and steel, railway rails are subject to very high stresses {{and have to be}} made of very high-quality steel alloy. It took many decades {{to improve the quality of}} the materials, including the change from iron to steel. The stronger the rails and the rest of the <b>trackwork,</b> the heavier and faster the trains the track can carry.|$|E

25|$|The tracks {{continue}} south (compass west) {{beyond the}} station to the 34th Street station. These tracks formerly led to an unused storage and layover area, but {{the extension of the}} Flushing Line, whose <b>trackwork</b> was completed in 2013, included the addition of third rails to the layover tracks, as well as the inspection and replacement of these tracks. The closed lower level platform at 42nd Street–Port Authority Bus Terminal on the IND Eighth Avenue Line was blocking the line but since removed. Currently, all Flushing-bound service is on the eastbound track, labeled Track 2, and 34th Street-bound service is on the westbound track, labeled Track 1.|$|E

25|$|One site {{considered}} was {{an island}} bounded by the River Derwent and the canal, called The Holmes, now Bass's Recreation Ground. The space was restricted and susceptible to flooding, and the <b>trackwork</b> would be complicated. The selected site was further {{south on the}} west bank, Borough's Fields, in Litchurch, at the southern side of the Castlefields estate. It was {{a mile from the}} town, but the Council built a carriageway to the town centre, along Siddals Lane, now Siddals Road. The station was built by the North Midland, with the other two companies renting spaces. The whole arrangement was confirmed by the North Midland Railway Act of 1839.|$|E
25|$|After {{extensive}} <b>trackwork</b> was planned, the Aurora Branch {{changed its}} name to the Chicago and Aurora Railroad in June 1852, and to Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad in 1856, and shortly reached its two other namesake cities, Burlington, Iowa and Quincy, Illinois. In 1868 CB completed bridges over the Mississippi River both at Burlington, Iowa, and Quincy, Illinois giving the railroad through connections with the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad (B) in Iowa and the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad (H) in Missouri. The first Railway Post Office was inaugurated on the H to sort mail on the trains way across Missouri, passing the mail to the Pony Express upon reaching the Missouri River at St. Joseph, Missouri.|$|E
25|$|At {{around the}} time the rail {{connection}} to wharf no. 2 was removed, the Railways Department decided to also rationalise their <b>trackwork</b> on the waterfront and informed the Harbour Board of their plans to disconnect wharves 4 and 7. The Harbour Board inspected wharf no. 4 and determined that rail access to it could continue for several more years provided repairs were made. They were also advised by the Traffic Manager that rail access to wharf no. 4 was still required, and it was therefore decided not to make any changes to this connection. However, the Department decided in October to proceed with its plans for wharf no. 7 and arrangements were made with the Inspector of the Permanent Way for this work to be carried out.|$|E

50|$|Before a steam {{locomotive}} was allowed onto the line, {{the crew had}} {{to carry out a}} large number of preparatory jobs. In accordance with the enginemen roster, the locomotive crew - engine driver and fireman - reported to the running foreman of the Betriebswerk in question. There they were given the key to their locomotive, a repair book, a route plan and timetable and a list of the <b>trackworks</b> en route. After completing all the formalities, the engine driver and fireman went to their engine, which was either berthed in the locomotive shed or stabled on a siding. After climbing into the driver's cab, the engine driver began with the most important checks: regulator, valve seals, water levels and a brake test. The fireman checked the equipment on board and the fuel supplies. Not until these checks had been carried out did the crew begin their actual work.|$|R
25|$|Illinois has an {{extensive}} passenger and freight rail transportation network. Chicago {{is a national}} Amtrak hub and in-state passengers are served by Amtrak's Illinois Service, featuring the Chicago to Carbondale Illini and Saluki, the Chicago to Quincy Carl Sandburg and Illinois Zephyr, and the Chicago to St. Louis Lincoln Service. Currently there is <b>trackwork</b> on the Chicago–St. Louis line to bring the maximum speed up to , which would reduce the trip time by {{an hour and a}} half. Nearly every North American railway meets at Chicago, making it the largest and most active rail hub in the country. Extensive commuter rail is provided in the city proper and some immediate suburbs by the Chicago Transit Authority's 'L' system. The largest suburban commuter rail system in the United States, operated by Metra, uses existing rail lines to provide direct commuter rail access for hundreds of suburbs to the city and beyond.|$|E
25|$|Concerned by {{the poor}} start in the Warwick, Waller decided to add ear muffs to Winx's racing {{equipment}} to help her relax – she had always worn them during <b>trackwork</b> but previously had them removed in the parade ring before racing. She made her next start on 2 September in the Chelmsford Stakes at Randwick. This time she broke well and settled {{near the front of}} the main pack. On the lead, Red Excitement set a quick pace and opened up a large lead of five lengths to the second place horse, who in turn was over five lengths in front of Winx. Turning into the stretch, Winx moved into second but still had five lengths to make up on Red Excitement with 450m remaining. At the 200m mark, she still had three lengths to make up when Bowman dropped the whip. Under a hand ride, Winx continued to close ground and pulled clear in the final strides to win by a length.|$|E

40|$|A {{focus of}} the railway {{industry}} over the past decades has been to research, find and develop methods to mitigate noise and vibration resulting from wheel/rail contact along track infrastructure. This resulted {{in a wide range}} of abatement measures that are available for today’s engineers. The suitability of each method must be analysed through budget and timeframe limitations, which includes building, maintenance and inspection costs and time allocation, while also aiming at delivering other benefits, such as environmental impact and durability of infrastructure. There are several situations that need noise and vibration mitigation methods, but each design allocates different priorities on a case-by-case basis. Traditionally, the disturbance caused by railways to the community are generated by wheel/rail contact sound radiation that is expressed in different ways, depending on the movement of the rolling stock and track alignment, such as rolling noise, impact noise and curve noise. More specifically, in special <b>trackworks</b> such as turnouts (or called “switches and crossings”), there are two types of noise that can often be observed: impact noise and screeching noise. With respect to the screeching (or flanging), its mitigation methods are usually associated with curve lubrications. In contrast, the impact noise emerges from the sound made by the rolling stock moving through joints and discontinuities (i. e., gaps), resulting in various noise abatement features to minimise such noise impact. Life cycle analysis is therefore vital for cost efficiency benchmarking of the mitigation methods. The evaluation is based on available data from open literature and the total costs were estimated from valid industry reports to maintain coherency. A 50 -year period for a life cycle analysis is chosen for this study. As for the general parameters, an area with a high density of people is considered to estimate the values for a community with very strict limits for noise and vibration...|$|R
500|$|Following the ride's {{opening it}} had several {{modifications}} and renovations, which included reprofiling {{parts of the}} ride, shortening the seven-car trains to six-car trains, and performing maintenance on the wooden track. Six Flags Over Texas performed over [...] of <b>trackwork</b> on the ride in the 2008–2009 offseason, with the ultimate aim of improving the ride's smoothness. Although the maintenance did improve the ride, park officials needed a more permanent solution. Initial speculation indicated the ride would be removed entirely from the park; however, Six Flags Over Texas denied any intention or consideration to do so. In March 2009, the park announced the closure of Texas Giant prior to a $10 million renovation. Following Fright Fest for that year, the ride closed on November 1, 2009.|$|E
