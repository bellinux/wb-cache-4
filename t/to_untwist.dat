2500|$|A yarn's {{usefulness}} for a knitting {{project is}} judged by several factors, {{such as its}} loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and of course its look, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features. [...] Other factors include allergenicity; speed of drying; resistance to chemicals, moths, and mildew; melting point and flammability; retention of static electricity; and the propensity to become stained and to accept dyes. [...] Different factors may be more significant than others for different knitting projects, {{so there is no}} one [...] "best" [...] yarn. [...] The resilience and propensity <b>to</b> (<b>un)twist</b> are general properties that affect the ease of hand-knitting. [...] More resilient yarns are more forgiving of irregularities in tension; highly twisted yarns are sometimes difficult to knit, whereas untwisting yarns can lead to split stitches, in which not all the yarn is knitted into a stitch. [...] A key factor in knitting is stitch definition, [...] corresponding to how well complicated stitch patterns can be seen when made from a given yarn. [...] Smooth, highly spun yarns are best for showing off stitch patterns; at the other extreme, very fuzzy yarns or eyelash yarns have poor stitch definition, and any complicated stitch pattern would be invisible.|$|E

6000|$|On a tiger-skin {{from the}} ice-clad {{regions of the}} sunless north recline the heroes of Ouida, rose-scented cigars in their mouths; {{themselves}} gloriously indolent and disdainful, but perhaps huddled a little too closely together {{on account of the}} limited accommodation. Strathmore is here. But I never felt sure of Strathmore. Was there not less in him than met the eye? His place, Whiteladies, was a home for kings and queens; but he was not the luxurious, magnanimous creature he feigned to be. A host may be known by the cigars he keeps; and, though it is perhaps a startling thing to say, we have good reason for believing that Strathmore did not buy good cigars. I question very much whether he had many Havanas, even of the second quality, at Whiteladies; if he had, he certainly kept them locked up. Only once does he so much as refer to them when at his own place, and then in the most general and suspicious way. [...] "Bah!" [...] he exclaims to a friend; [...] "there is Phil smoking these wretched musk-scented cigarettes again! they are only fit for Lady Georgie or Eulalie Papellori. What taste, when there are my Havanas and cheroots!" [...] The remark, in whatever way considered, is suggestive. In the first place, it is made late in the evening, after Strathmore and his friend have left the smoking-room. Thus it is a safe observation. I would not {{go so far as to}} say that he had no Havanas in the house; the likelihood is that he had a few in his cigar-case, kept there for show rather than use. These, if I understand the man, would be a good brand, but of small size--perhaps Reinas--and they would hardly be of a well-known crop. In color they would be dark--say maduro--and he would explain that he bought them because he liked full-flavored weeds. Possibly he had a Villar y Villar box with six or eight in the bottom of it; but boxes are not cigars. What he did provide his friends with was Manillas. He smoked them himself, and how careful he was of them is seen on every other page. He is constantly stopping in the middle of his conversation to [...] "curl a loose leaf round his Manilla;" [...] when one would have expected a hero like Strathmore to fling away a cigar when its leaves began <b>to</b> <b>untwist,</b> and light another. So thrifty is Strathmore that he even laboriously [...] "curls the leaves round his cigarettes"--he does not so much as pretend that they are Egyptian; nay, even when quarrelling with Errol, his beloved friend (whom he shoots through the heart), he takes a cigarette from his mouth and [...] "winds a loosened leaf" [...] round it.|$|E

However, suitable choices for the magnetic fields, corresponding to selfdual configurations in the internal space, can yield new chiral supersymmetric vacua with gauge groups of reduced rank, where the magnetic energy saturates, partly or fully, the negative tension of the O 5 + planes.
