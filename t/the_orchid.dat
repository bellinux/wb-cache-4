5|$|Adaptation {{had been}} in {{development}} {{as far back as}} 1994. Jonathan Demme brought the project to Columbia Pictures with Kaufman writing the script. Kaufman experienced writer's block and {{did not know what to}} think of <b>The</b> <b>Orchid</b> Thief. Finally he wrote a script based on his experience of adapting the book into a screenplay. Jonze signed to direct, and filming was finished in June 2001. Though the film is billed as an adaptation of <b>The</b> <b>Orchid</b> Thief, its primary narrative focus is Charlie Kaufman's struggle to adapt <b>The</b> <b>Orchid</b> Thief into a film, while dramatizing the events of the book in parallel. Adaptation also adds a number of fictitious elements, including Kaufman's twin brother (also credited as a writer for the film) and a romance between Orlean and Laroche, and culminates in completely invented events including fictional versions of Orlean and Laroche three years after the events related in <b>The</b> <b>Orchid</b> Thief.|$|E

At the helicopter, Kate, Sayid, and the Others free Ben by ambushing and killing the mercenaries, except Keamy, who feigns death. In return, the Others allow Kate, Sayid and the other survivors to leave the island on the helicopter. Ben returns to <b>the</b> <b>Orchid,</b> where he gets in a hidden elevator with Locke.|$|E

50|$|The park {{harbours}} {{many different}} biotopes and therefore possesses a very varied flora. Remarkable are <b>the</b> <b>orchids</b> with 25 different known species. Amongst <b>the</b> <b>orchids</b> one finds species like Anacamptis coriophora, bee orchid, Dactylorhiza maculata, fly orchid, frog orchid and pyramidal <b>orchid.</b> Besides <b>the</b> <b>orchids</b> grow chelidonium, common bluebell, cornflower, the carnivorous Drosera rotundifolia, equisetum, Gentiana pneumonanthe, geum, honeysuckle, mentha, Papaver rhoeas, Polygonatum multiflorum and Verbascum thapsus.|$|R

5000|$|Orchidales is a {{botanical name}} of an order of {{flowering}} plants. In taxonomical systems, this is a relatively recent name as early systems used descriptive botanical names for the order containing <b>the</b> <b>orchids.</b> <b>The</b> Bentham & Hooker and the Engler systems had <b>the</b> <b>orchids</b> in order Microspermae while the Wettstein system treats them as order Gynandrae. Circumscription of the order will vary with the taxonomic system being used. Although mostly the order will consist of <b>the</b> <b>orchids</b> only (usually in one family only, but sometimes divided into more families, as in the Dahlgren system, see below), sometimes other families are added: ...|$|R

5|$|A {{total of}} 57 genera of {{flowering}} plants contain at least 500 species, {{according to a}} 2004 analysis by the botanical taxonomist David Frodin. The actual numbers of species are imprecisely known, {{as many of the}} genera have not been the subject of recent monographs. For instance, {{estimates of the number of}} species in <b>the</b> <b>orchid</b> genus Pleurothallis range from 1,120 to 2,500. Genera from other groups of vascular plants, but which have similarly large numbers of species, include Selaginella, Asplenium and Cyathea.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophoropsis {{species have}} fruit bodies with concave caps that often have wavy margins and rolled-in edges. The {{texture of the}} cap surface ranges from {{somewhat}} tomentose to velvety. Typical fruit body colors are orange, brownish-yellow (fulvous) or paler, buff, and cream. The gills have a decurrent attachment to the stipe. They are narrow with blunt edges, often multiply forked, and readily detachable from the stipe. The flesh is soft and generally the same colour as the fruit body surface, or lighter. The taste and odour of the flesh is usually nondescript, or similar to cultivated mushrooms. In contrast, H.rufa can have a distinct ozone-like smell, reportedly reminiscent of <b>the</b> <b>orchid</b> Oncidium ornithorhynchum or a photocopier.|$|E

She later appeared in the unauthorized biography Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), part of an ensemble cast that included Sam Rockwell, Drew Barrymore, George Clooney, and Julia Roberts. The movie grossed US$33 million worldwide. That same year, she had a small role in the comedy 40 Days and 40 Nights.|$|E

5|$|The idea to do a film {{adaptation}} of Susan Orlean's <b>The</b> <b>Orchid</b> Thief {{dates back to}} 1994. Fox 2000 purchased the film rights in 1997, eventually selling them to Jonathan Demme, who set the project at Columbia Pictures. Charlie Kaufman was hired to write the script, but struggled with the adaptation and writer's block. Kaufman eventually created a script of his experience in adaptation, exaggerating events, and creating a fictional brother named Donald Kaufman. Kaufman put Donald Kaufman's name on the script and dedicated the film to the fictional character. By September 1999, Kaufman had written two drafts of the script; he turned in a third draft in November 2000.|$|E
5|$|According to Alexander H. Smith's {{organization}} of the genus Mycena, M.aurantiomarginata is classified in section Calodontes, subsection Granulatae, which contains species with roughened cheilocystidia (cystidia on gill edges), such as M.rosella, M.flavescens, M.elegans, and M.strobilinoides. In his 1992 study of Mycena, Dutch mycologist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus put M.aurantiomarginata in the section Luculentae, characterized by species with an olive to yellowish-olive and moist cap, pallid to gray-olive gills with bright orange margins, brownish to grayish-olive stipes, white spore deposit, and spiny cystidia. M.aurantiomarginata was included in a 2010 molecular analysis focused on clarifying the phylogenetic relationships between Northern European species in the section Calodontes. The results suggested that, based on the similarity of nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences, the fungus {{is closely related to}} M.crocata and M.leaiana. This conclusion was previously corroborated by research that used molecular analysis to demonstrate that several Mycena species can be mycorrhizal partners of <b>the</b> <b>orchid</b> Gastrodia confusa.|$|E
5|$|The player {{does not}} receive any {{explicit}} guidance {{on how to}} play and is left to decipher the game's objectives through trial and error. Sabre Wulf graphics fill the screen with a minimal user interface consisting of the current game score, number of lives left and a high score meter on the top row. Sabreman can eat orchid power-ups, which bloom {{for only a few}} seconds, to turn the colour of <b>the</b> <b>orchid</b> and receive a temporary character effect. Some effects empower (e.g. invulnerability, increased speed) while others impair (e.g. reversing the player's controls). Sabreman can also collect treasure and extra lives scattered throughout the maze. The Spectrum and Commodore 64 releases include a two-player mode in which players take turns controlling their own Sabreman.|$|E

Other notable plants include shrubs such as Rhodomyrtus tomentosa, Gaultheria fragrantissima, herbs, Exacum trinervium, E. walkeri, Drosera indica, and tree ferns Cyathea spp. Anzia, a foliose lichen genus belonging to Parmeliaceae family, which had not been recorded in Sri Lanka before, was discovered here in 2007. There are conflicting views on how the grasslands of the park came into being, whether man-made or natural. It is now believed that the grasslands on the dry slopes were created by forest clearance and fires while grasslands in low-lying areas were naturally created by wet conditions, frost and soil erosion.|$|E
5|$|While {{pollination}} by ants {{is somewhat}} rare, several Myrmecia {{species have been}} observed pollinating flowers. For example, <b>the</b> <b>orchid</b> Leporella fimbriata is a myrmecophyte {{which can only be}} pollinated by the winged male ant M. urens. Pollination of this orchid usually occurs between April and June during warm afternoons, and may take several days until the short-lived males all die. The flower mimics M. urens queens, so the males move from flower to flower in an attempt to copulate with it. M. nigrocincta workers have been recorded visiting flowers of Eucalyptus regnans and Senna acclinis, and are considered a potential pollination vector for E. regnans trees. Although Senna acclinis is self-compatible, the inability of M. nigrocincta to appropriately release pollen would restrict its capacity to effect pollination. Foraging M. pilosula workers are regularly observed on the inflorescences of Prasophyllum alpinum (mostly pollinated by wasps of the family Ichneumonidae). Although pollinia are often seen in the ants' jaw, they have a habit of cleaning their mandibles on the leaves and stems of nectar-rich plants before moving on, preventing pollen exchange. Whether M. pilosula contributes to pollination is unknown.|$|E
