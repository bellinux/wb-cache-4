Since it is known that wetlands have the ability to retain nutrients, and creation of wetlands have been suggested as an important control measure, it is of interest to focus on incentives for wetland creation, which is what this paper does. Since the national policy goals set the general framework but it is at the local level that they are translated into concrete actions, both national policy and the question of implementation are discussed. This paper also focuses on the design of grants for wetland creation since they play an important role for landowners desire to create wetlands. 2...|$|R

While earlier studies were often relatively segmented, focusing either on the hazard itself or on impact and vulnerability, more recent research programs on the topic have been much more integrated, simultaneously addressing hazards and vulnerability, as well as the population’s perception of risk – see for instance the French programs MISEEVA (2008 – 2011), JOHANNA (2010 – 2013), BARCASUB (2010 – 2013), COCORISCO (2011 – 2014), and European studies on the management of marine flooding and submersion risk (Samuels et al. 2008; Sorensen et al. 2017).|$|R
40|$|Writing correct {{parallel}} programs {{becomes more}} and more difficult as the complexity and heterogeneity of processors <b>increase.</b> <b>This</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> addressed by parallelising compilers. Various compiler directives can be used to tell these compilers where to parallelise. This paper addresses the correctness of such compiler directives for loop parallelisation. Specifically, we propose a technique based on separation logic to verify whether a loop can be parallelised. Our approach requires each loop iteration to be specified with the locations that are read and written in this iteration. If the specifications are correct, they can be used to draw conclusions about loop (in) dependences. Moreover, they also reveal where synchronisation is needed in the parallelised program. The loop iteration specifications can be verified using permission-based separation logic and seamlessly integrate with functional behaviour specifications. We formally prove the correctness of our approach and we discuss automated tool support for our technique. Additionally, we also discuss how the loop iteration contracts can be compiled into specifications for the code coming out of the parallelising compiler...|$|R
40|$|In optical {{communication}} systems, due to cost restriction and setup complexity issues, intensity modulation and direct detection (IMIDD) {{are the best}} options to be implemented compared to coherent system. In IMIDD technique, a modulator at the transmitter and a photo detector at the receiver are required, where the implementation of this technique, typically, employed line codes such as non return-to-zero (NRZ) or return-to-zero (RZ). This technique has been standardized in Optical Transport Network (OTN), Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) standard, and Ethernet. However, using the existing technique, the chromatic dispersion (CD) tolerance was reduces significantly as bit rate <b>increasing.</b> <b>This</b> <b>issue</b> will <b>be</b> more serious for RZ compared to NRZ even though RZ has high clock information. Therefore, a new multi-slot and multi-level coding technique, which {{is a combination of}} multiplexing and coding technique, known as Multi Slot Amplitude Coding (MSAC) is proposed.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{transistors}} {{that can be}} integrated on the same silicon die doubles every 2 years. As a consequence today {{it is possible to}} manufacture more and more complex System-on-Chip including several processing and storage elements. However, deep sub-micron (DSM) technologies imply also some physical issues, known as DSM effects, which force to introduce important architectural changes. The Network-on-Chip (NoC) paradigm has been proposed as a possible solution for designing scalable and flexible on-chip communication infrastructures in new generation technologies. While technology scales down, the interconnection delay becomes significant and in some cases <b>increases.</b> <b>This</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> known as wire-delay problem and {{it is one of the}} most limiting deep submicron effects. In order to allow the implementation of complex SoCs with reasonable time-to-market, NoCs have to rely on efficient Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS) architectures able to simplify the timing convergence and to efficiently allow the integration of deeply different IPs. Another challenge consists in finding solutions for designing high-performance and low-power on-chip memories suitable for the implementation of large level-two caches in single and multi-processor architectures. The Non Uniform Cache Architecture (NUCA) paradigm is the chosen solution to reduce the negative effects of the wire-delay on the memory access time. In this work an effective GALS Network-on-Chip architecture to reduce deep submicron effects in complex SoCs is proposed. Such architecture has been mainly developed for the Versatile-STNoC (VSTNoC) solution, the STMicroelectronics Network-on-Chip already used in a manufactured complex SoC for HDTV applications. It is expected that this approach will drastically simplify timing convergence, enabling the implementation of complex functionalities and introducing big benefits in terms of time-to-market and performance. An alternative NUCA design to implement large on-chip level-two caches is also proposed. This solution, known as TD-NUCA, is particularly suitable for application specific domains, in order to minimize silicon area, maximize performance and reduce power consumption...|$|R

40|$|The global {{installed}} capacity of wind power {{has shown a}} significant growth, from 24 GW in 2001 to 370 GW in 2014. The trend shows that an increasing capacity of wind power is being connected to the electric power system. Due to lower {{costs associated with the}} connection of wind power to distribution systems, their wind power hosting capacity needs to be fully exploited. The hosting capacity of distribution systems is limited due to a number of issues such as voltage flicker and harmonics, overvoltage and thermal overloading, and increased fault level. A further issue that deserves attention is that the effect of wind power on the frequency of tap changes (FTC) of the substation transformer due to highly fluctuating nature of wind power. Thus, the thesis investigates these integration issues of wind power and identifies the limiting factors. Then, the thesis proposes mitigation solutions so as to maximize the hosting capacity of a distribution system. Moreover, the thesis investigates the control and coordination of different mitigation solutions. The investigation of the effect of wind power on the FTC shows that the change on the FTC in a distribution system connected to an external grid with X/R ≥ 5 is negligible up to a significant level of wind power penetration. However, in a distribution system connected to an external grid with lower X/R ratio, {{a significant increase in the}} FTC has been observed as wind power penetration <b>increases.</b> <b>This</b> <b>issue</b> has <b>been</b> effectively mitigated by using reactive power from the wind turbines. Furthermore, the thesis identifies voltage rise and thermal overloading as the two main limiting factors of wind power integration into distribution systems. Thus, active management strategies (AMSs) [...] such as wind energy curtailment (WEC), reactive power compensation (RPC), and coordinated on load tap changer (OLTC) voltage control [...] have been investigated in the thesis to increase the wind power hosting capacity of distribution systems. To facilitate the investigation, an optimization model whose objective function is to maximize the profit gained by the distribution system operator (DSO) and the wind farm owner (WFO) is developed. The results of the analysis show that by using AMSs the wind power hosting capacity of a distribution system can be increased up to twice the capacity that would have been installed without AMSs. Further wind power installation calls for grid reinforcement as a preferred strategy. In order to implement these AMSs, the system states, i. e. bus voltages, need to be known. Thus, state estimation is proposed as a cost efficient way of obtaining information about the system states. The investigation of the state estimation (SE) algorithms for distribution system applications has identified that the node-voltage-based weighted least square SE algorithm is more appropriate in a system where only few real time measurements are available. Moreover, the analysis of measurement types and locations has shown that power injection and voltage measurements from wind turbine sites provide cost-effective solution with superior SE accuracy. Consequently, the control of the OLTC is carried out by relaxing the deadband of the automatic voltage control (AVC) relay so that the AVC relay acts on the network’s maximum or minimum voltage obtained through the SE. This is found to be simpler to realize than adjusting the set point of the AVC relay. Voltage control through RPC and WEC as well as overload mitigation through WEC is actualized by using integral controllers implemented locally at the wind turbine site. Furthermore, RPC from the local wind turbine is also used to mitigate an overvoltage at a remote bus on the same feeder when the remote wind turbine reaches its regulation limit. The coordination of voltage regulation between RPC and WEC is achieved by using slightly varying reference voltages for each controller and they are in turn coordinated to the SE-assisted OLTC voltage control by using time delays. The different control and coordination strategies proposed in the thesis are successfully demonstrated using an actual distribution network, measured load, and wind power data...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{increasing}} Greenhouse Gases {{in atmosphere}} {{is the main}} cause of climate and ecosystems changes. The most important greenhouse gas is CO 2 that causes global warming or the greenhouse effect. One of the known solutions that reduces atmospheric carbon and helps to improve the situation, is carbon sequestration in vegetation cover and soil. Carbon sequestration refers to the change in atmospheric CO 2 into organic carbon compounds by plants and capture it for a certain time. However, the ecosystems with different vegetation have Impressive Influence on soil carbon sequestration (SCS). Soil as the main component of these ecosystems is a world-wide indicator which has been known {{to play an important role}} in global balance of carbon sequestration. Furthermore, carbon sequestration can be a standard world trade and becomes guaranteed. Costs of transfer of CO 2 (carbon transfer From the atmosphere into the soil) based on the negative effects of increased CO 2 on Weather <b>is</b> always <b>increasing,</b> <b>This</b> <b>issue</b> can <b>be</b> faced by developing countries to create a new industry, especially when conservation and restoration of rangeland to follow. This research was regarded due to estimation of SCS in three land use types (orchard, paddy rice and forest) in a Part of Ramsar Lands, Northern Iran. Materials and Methods: Ramsar city with an area of about 729 / 7 km 2 is located in the western part of Mazandaran province. Its height above sea level is 20 meters. Ramsar city is situated in a temperate and humid climate. Land area covered by forest, orchard and paddy rice. After field inspection of the area, detailed topographic maps of the specified zone on the study were also tested. In each of the three land types, 500 hectares in the every growing and totally 1, 500 hectares as study area were selected. For evaluation the sequestration of carbon in different vegetation systems, 15 soil profile selected and sampling from depth of 0 to 100 centimetres of each profile was done by collecting 15 samples with the total number of 45 samples. Soil sampling (at the 0 - 100 cm depth) was carried out following determination of points on map. Some of soil features (i. e., Soil structure, Bulk density,Texture, Acidity, CEC, total Nitrogen and Organic Carbon) were measured in the laboratory. Then, the ANOVA and Duncan tests were employed due to statistical analysis using of SPSS software package. Also The map of carbon sequestration was prepared using of GIS approach. Results and Discussion :According to obtained results, the amounts of SCS were imposed by different land uses as non-significant. The amounts of SCS were found in forest (4532. 35 ton/ha), orchard (2997. 66 ton/ha) and paddy rice (2682. 55 ton/ha) land use, respectively. The differences may be resulted from the variation among the ecosystem types and plant species. Forests are located in wetlands in the high forest and agricultural land more organic carbon levels (0 to 20 cm), but non-significant difference was observed in the soil depth in these areas. The Increased amount of carbon sequestration in the Orchard of the Paddy Rice can be interpreted due to long-term use of fertilizer in the orchards. In Paddy Rice of study due to deep plowing, results showed more decline of organic matter and the loss of carbon from soils. In addition, the maximumtotal nitrogen, organic and sequestrated carbon in top soil (0 - 10 cm depth) were detected in forest (866. 968 ton/ha),whereas the least amount dedicated in paddy rice (393. 4 ton/ha) land uses. Four classes of detected soil in the study area were included AlfiSols, Inceptisols, Entisols and Mollisols Conclusions: We found no significant differences in terms of carbon sequestration in land use due to the impact of climate, annually high rainfall and washing clay seems logical. The plant communities in forest ecosystems can become more capable to absorb and retain carbon than other vegetation cover. Agriculture and farming operations are due to dispersion aggregates, reduce of organic matter and carbon sequestration compared to forest intact soils. Considering the vital role of soil carbon sequestration as one of the known values in terms of natural ecosystems and the importance of soil conservation programs, further research works are recommended on the effects of biotic factors such as grazing and land-use changes...|$|R
