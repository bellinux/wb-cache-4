40|$|We {{quantify}} agglomeration spillovers {{by comparing}} changes in {{total factor productivity}} (TFP) among incumbent plants in "winning" counties that attracted a large manufacturing plant and "losing" counties that were the new plant's runner-up choice. Winning and losing counties have similar trends in TFP prior to the new plant opening. Five years after the opening, incumbent plants' TFP is 12 percent higher in winning counties. This productivity spillover is larger for plants sharing similar labor and <b>technology</b> <b>pools</b> with the new plant. Consistent with spatial equilibrium models, labor costs increase in winning counties, indicating that profits ultimately increase less than productivity. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago.

40|$|We {{quantify}} agglomeration spillovers by {{estimating the}} impact of the opening of a large new manufacturing plant on the total factor productivity (TFP) of incumbent plants in the same county. Articles in the corporate real estate journal Site Selection reveal the county where the "Million Dollar Plant" ultimately chose to locate (the "winning county"), as well as the one or two runner-up counties (the "losing counties"). The incumbent plants in the losing counties are used as a counterfactual for the TFP of incumbent plants in winning counties {{in the absence of the}} plant opening. Incumbent plants in winning and losing counties have economically and statistically similar trends in TFP in the 7 years before the opening, which supports the validity of the identifying assumption. After the new plant opening, incumbent plants in winning counties experience a sharp relative increase in TFP. Five years after the opening, TFP of incumbent plants in winning counties is 12 % higher than TFP of incumbent plants in losing counties. Consistent with some theories of agglomeration, this effect is larger for incumbent plants that share similar labor and <b>technology</b> <b>pools</b> with the new plant. We also find evidence of a relative increase in skill-adjusted labor costs in winning counties, indicating that the ultimate effect on profits is smaller than the direct increase in productivity. ...|$|E

40|$|The first essay {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} the 1930 's American Dust Bowl and investigates how much the short-term costs from erosion were mitigated by long-term adjustments. Exploiting new data collected to identify low, medium, and high erosion counties, estimates indicate that the Dust Bowl led to substantial immediate decreases in agricultural land values and revenues. Until at least the 1950 's, however, there was limited reallocation of farmland away from activities that became relatively less productive due to erosion. Relative changes in agricultural land values and revenues indicate that the annualized long-term cost was 86 % of the short-term cost to agriculture. Substantial out-migration reflects the large cost of the Dust Bowl, and was an important channel through which short-term costs were partly mitigated. The second essay examines the impact on agricultural development from the introduction of barbed wire fencing to the American Plains in the late 19 th century. Farmers were required to construct fences to be entitled to compensation for damage by others' livestock. From 1880 to 1900, the introduction and universal adoption of barbed wire greatly reduced the cost of fences, relative to predominant wooden fences, most in counties with the least woodland. Over that period, counties with the least woodland experienced substantial relative increases in settlement, land improvement, land values, and the productivity and production share of crops most in need of protection. (cont.) This increase in agricultural development appears partly to reflect farmers' increased ability to protect their land from encroachment. States' inability to protect this full bundle of property rights on the frontier, beyond providing formal land titles, might have otherwise restricted agricultural development. The third essay quantifies agglomeration spillovers by comparing the growth of total factor productivity (TFP) among incumbent plants in "winning" counties that attracted a large manufacturing plant to "losing" counties that were the plant's second choice. Five years after the opening, incumbent plants' TFP is 12 % higher in winning counties. This effect is larger for plants with similar labor and <b>technology</b> <b>pools</b> as the new plant. We find evidence of increased wages in winning counties, indicating that profits increase by less than productivity. by Richard A. Hornbeck. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{framework}} {{of this research}} is competition law and IPRs. Competition law regulation concerning Block Exemption concerning the Transfer of Technology (TTBER) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) Articles 101 and 102 mean that companies have to take into consideration certain regulation {{in order to avoid the}} intervention of competition authorities. As the system of TTBER is based on a self-announcement system, companies may take more or less risk in their agreement praxis. The research questions were: What are the preconditions for a competition according to the new Block Exemption Regulation concerning the Transfer of Technology (TTBER) ? This research question can be divided into the following sub-questions: 1) 	How small and medium size companies (SMEs) fulfill the criteria of permitted competition after the changes in Block Exemption Regulation concerning the Transfer of Technology? – how SMEs try to achieve market shares 2) 	How small and medium size companies fulfill the criteria of Block Exemption according the new regulation? These questions were scrutinized by litterature reviews, case analysis and updated materials from experts e. g. corporate lawyers and attorneys. The main results of the research were as follows: The doctrine of the misuse of a dominant position has often been a core issue in case law of European Court of Justice (ECJ) and especially the essential facilities problem. It has a chain effect to TTBER regulation. A dominant company can decide how to promote innovations. To identify the market shares it is important to find the relevant markets. The strength and knowledge of the licensee effects to the possibilities to succeed in license negotiations. A powerful company having the resources can take into account the TTBER regulation to favour its goals and take advantage of the economic condition. Often a high royalty is agreed in order to avoid claims. In R&D projects the amount of innovations is relevant in contract negotiations. In some cases companies have agreed of royalties in relation to the amount of the IPRs. SMEs grow into large companies and form joint ventures: it is not easy to evaluate how and when they fulfil the conditions of permitted competition. <b>Technology</b> <b>pools</b> are nowadays allowed, if they are not aiming to restrict competition and there are grounds for them, which are related to the technology.

40|$|The {{process of}} European {{integration}} {{has introduced a}} valuable empirical example {{on the impact of}} economic integration on income convergence. Many empirical papers confirm the income convergence within the new member states and between the new and old members. At the same time it is found that the main contribution to economic growth in these catching-up countries comes from the total factor productivity growth (TFP), which motivates us to take a deeper look on the factors behind TFP developments. The objective {{of this paper is to}} shed light on the characteristics behind the productivity development in the new EU member countries. It may be generalised that the productivity development of a country, industry or firm is determined by two main factors: its own effort to develop new technologies and some external <b>technology</b> <b>pool.</b> The ability to internalize the latter into the own productivity growth depends again on many factors like: various technology diffusion channels as foreign direct investment (FDI); import and export; absorptive capacity and geographic proximity. There is a vast empirical literature on drivers of productivity and productivity spillovers, but up to our knowledge there is no comparative analysis on CEE countries. The CEE countries are typical middle income countries that do not devote many resources on own R&D, but due to the common market have presumably benefited a lot from the <b>technology</b> <b>pool</b> of the neighbouring high-income EU members. Our paper contributes to the literature by investigating comparatively the eight EU members with former Soviet background and controlling for geographical proximity. We compose a 2 -digit NACE industry-level data set over the time-span of 1995 - 2007 and employ a dynamic panel data analysis methods suggested by Arellano-Bover/Blundell-Bond. The preliminary results indicate that compared to studies on high-income countries CEE countries have benefited relatively more from foreign R&D stock and this effect is the strongest for small countries. Our analysis shows also that the geographical proximity to the high-income countries matters and within the EU geographic proximity is a better technology diffusion channel than trade flows...|$|R

40|$|Several {{papers have}} {{recently}} analyzed {{the theory and}} implementation of renewable energy support schemes. The case for a renewable electricity standard (RES) in tandem with a tradeable green certificate (TGC) market has been largely based on efficiency considerations. Case study evidence is inconclusive, {{in part due to}} the short track record, but is not generally favorable. Here we reconsider the efficiency case, both static and dynamic, in light of special characteristics of renewable energy projects. We find that when exclusively high fixed-cost technologies comprise the eligible <b>technology</b> <b>pool,</b> the equilibrium form of contracting obviates the principal efficiency advantages claimed for certificate markets. When low fixed-cost technologies compete alongside high fixed-cost technologies in the certificate market, we show that it is likely that long-term contracts will disappear, and the technological choice will be inefficiently shifted away from the high fixed-cost technology. We consider evidence from three well-developed certificate schemes [...] in Britain, Sweden, and Texas [...] and find that it is broadly consistent with the theory here. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSustainability {{requires}} that {{quality of life}} and resource consumption are harmonized. The use of sustainable technologies fosters their harmonization. A scenario based method has been developed for identifying sustainable technology systems on different levels of development and in different areas of human living. The developed method consists of four elements: the surrounding field scenarios, <b>technology</b> <b>pool,</b> sustainability assessment and system creation. They can be applied in various paths with different starting points. The two technology induced paths, emanating from either a system or a system element, enable the transformation of technological potentials into useful applications. The problem induced path, emanating from future framework conditions of an observed field, allows human needs to be satisfied trough technological potentials. The application shown in this paper illustrates the usage of the method's problem induced path in mobility as one area of human living. Based on three surrounding field scenarios for bicycle mobility in Berlin, technology systems for bicycle design, operation and their repair in self-help workshops are illustrated...|$|R

40|$|Latent class {{modelling}} (LC) {{has been}} advanced as a promising alternative for addressing heterogeneity in frontier analysis models, in particular those where the individual scores {{are used in}} regulatory settings. If the production possibility set contains multiple distinct <b>technologies,</b> <b>pooled</b> approaches would result in biased results. We revisit the fundamentals of production theory and formulate a set of criteria for identification of heterogeneity: completeness (the inclusion of all data in the analysis), stationarity (the temporal stability of the identified production technologies), and endogeneity (no ad hoc determination of the cardinality of the classes). We also distinguish between the identification of a sporadic idiosyncratic shock, an outlier observation, and the identification of a time-persistent technology. Using a representative data set for regulation (a panel for Swedish electricity distributors 2000 - 2006), we test LC modelling for a Cobb-Douglas production function using the defined criteria. The LC results are compared to the pooled stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) model as a benchmark. Outliers are detected using an adjusted DEA super-efficiency procedure. Our results show that about 78 % of the distributors are assigned to a single class, the remaining 22 % split into two smaller classes that are non-stationary and largely composed of outliers. It is hardly conceivable that a production technology could change over this short horizon, implying that LC should be seen more as an enhanced outlier analysis than as a solid identification method for heterogeneity in the production set. More generally, we argue that the claim for heterogeneity in reference set deserves a more rigorous investigation to control for the multiple effects of sample size bias, specification error and the impact on functional form assumptions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the research done on providing interactive 2 D and 3 D content for micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). MEMS is a multidisciplinary field, which uses exclusive lab equipment and high-end design/analysis software adopted from different fields, such as electrical, mechanical, chemical engineering and solid state physics. This multidisciplinary nature, {{in addition to}} the highly customized design software, makes it a challenging topic to deliver over the web. Many MEMS software programs lack modern presentation tools which makes it difficult for designers in industry and academics to communicate their designs with their colleagues and students. Authors of this paper have made an effort {{to bridge the gap between}} the design/analysis and presentation by introducing interactive tools that can mimic the behavior of the real MEMS devices and their outputs. By using the tools provided, students can learn about different fabrication methods and basic MEMS elements. They can also design their own device and analyze it using the free tools provided. Video of the real experiments are also at the website. Students can play with a simulator of the experiment remotely and obtain the simulated results that follow the behavior of the real experiment.
