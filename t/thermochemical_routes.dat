Soybean oil is the main raw material for biodiesel production in Brazil, although there are many other vegetable oils with potential for this purpose. Related to the production costs, the soybean biodiesel has higher costs than diesel. Then, this biofuel is only produced due to Brazilian regulatory rules and public subsidies.

40|$|The {{stagnant}} {{development of}} microalgae-based industries suggests {{a need for}} a broader assessment of its commercial potential, particularly given its ability to utilize industrial waste effluents in cultivation and produce multiple outputs from the biomass, including an environmentally superior biofuel. This study assessed the financial feasibility of producing microalgae biodiesel from transesterification, together with feed and fertilizer in a multi-output production system, integrated with a complementary waste-producing industry. The multi-output system allowed for the price of biodiesel to be sold at the competitive market price of US$ 1. 50 /L rather than US$ 24. 18 /L, if it were produced as the only primary output. The high-value feed and fertilizer offset the low revenues of biodiesel to ensure the financial feasibility of the production system. Sensitivity analyses of these estimates indicated where improvements could further increase the financial appeal of this multi-output microalgae production system. In particular, a 20 % improvement in the cost-efficiency of lipid extraction and transesterification processes was found to have a 17 -fold increase in the net present value. The results suggest that multi-output systems have several benefits for the potential of a microalgae-based industry, namely the synergistic benefits of integrating microalgae production with complementary industries and the investment appeal of microalgae-based biofuels that can be priced competitively while still being financial feasible.

Theoretical demonstration was performed using thermodynamic equilibrium simulations, revealing that the syngas composition is dependent on the reactant ratios. Experimental proof of concept was determined by executing a factorial experimental design in an allothermal, high temperature entrained flow reactor and revealed that temperature is the dominant factor on the major performance indicators. Reaction pathways were explored further through tests with three different biomass types and isolation of the two major heterogeneous reaction steps: pyrolysis and char gasification. Atomic balances showed hydrogen is easily evolved from both biomass and methane whereas carbon is bound in intermediate gaseous and solid species such that CO formation is the overall rate-limiting process. Biomass pyrolysis was probed in a series of drop-tube and entrained flow experiments followed by characterization of the product char morphology and reactivity. Pyrolysis was determined to be heat transfer-limited, taking place on the order of 10 - 2 - 100 seconds. The rate and reaction time were investigated through development and implementation of an integral, infinite-rate kinetic model. The char gasification rate was shown to be highly dependent on particle thermal history and biomass type based on factors such as surface area, pore size distribution, and degree of graphitization.

The process design is based on an extensive literature survey and analysis for the potentials of variable feedstocks including energy crops as well as residual and waste materials of biomass, possible production routes and the state of corresponding technologies. The designed process is simulated using Aspen Plus and consists of the following 5 major steps: biomass drying, autothermal gasification with entrained flow gasifier, gas cleanup and conditioning, higher alcohol synthesis over a modified methanol catalyst and alcohol separation. To enhance the product yields, a portion of the generated methane and other hydrocarbons is reformed through autothermal reforming to produce additional syngas and recycled together with unreacted syngas. Through the process optimization, a final product yield of 6232. 5 kg/h of butanol fuel is obtained, which contains 88. 2 wt. % of isobutanol and 10. 7 wt. % of propanol. A heat integration based on pinch analysis is carried out and an optimized heat exchanger network has been developed, resulting in an energy-efficient process which requires no external hot utilities and only small part of power from grid. An overall plant efficiency of 60. 9 % is achieved. Based on the simulation results from Aspen Plus, an economic evaluation is carried out to estimate the net production costs of butanol fuel, which turns out to have a specific net production cost of 2. 25 €/L.

In our research, South Africa {{is used as a}} case study to demonstrate the sustainable design for the future biorefineries annexed to existing sugar industry. Detailed techno-economic evaluation and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) were applied to model alternative routes for converting sugarcane residues (bagasse and trash) to selected biofuel and/or biochemicals (ethanol, ethanol and lactic acid, ethanol and furfural, butanol, methanol and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, with co-production of surplus electricity) in an energy self-sufficient biorefinery system. Results Economic assessment indicated that methanol synthesis with an internal rate of return (IRR) of 16. 7 % and ethanol–lactic acid co-production (20. 5 %) met the minimum investment criteria of 15 %, while the latter had the lowest sensitivity to market price amongst all the scenarios.

40|$|Biomass has {{received}} considerable attention as a sustainable feedstock that can replace diminishing fossil fuels {{for the production}} of energy, especially for the transportation sector. The overall strategy in the production of hydrocarbon fuels from biomass is (i) to reduce the substantial oxygen content of the parent feedstock to improve energy density and (ii) to create C–C bonds between biomass-derived intermediates to increase the molecular weight of the final hydrocarbon product. We begin this review with a brief overview of first-generation biofuels, specifically bioethanol and biodiesel. We consider the implications of utilizing starchy and triglyceride feedstocks from traditional food crops, and we provide an overview of second-generation technologies to process the major constituents of more abundant lignocellulosic biomass, such as <b>thermochemical</b> <b>routes</b> (gasification, pyrolysis, liquefaction) which directly process whole lignocellulose to upgradeable platforms (e. g., synthesis gas and bio-oil). The primary focus of this review is an overview of catalytic strategies to produce biofuels from aqueous solutions of carbohydrates, which are isolated through biomass pretreatment and hydrolysis. Although hydrolysis-based platforms are associated with higher upstream costs arising from pretreatment and hydrolysis, the aqueous solutions of biomass-derived compounds can be processed selectively to yield hydrocarbons with targeted molecular weights and structures. For example, sugars can be used as reforming feedstocks {{for the production of}} renewable hydrogen, or they can be dehydrated to yield furfurals or levulinic acid. For each of the platforms discussed, we have suggested relevant strategies for the formation of C–C bonds, such as aldol condensation of ketones and oligomerization of alkenes, to enable the production of gasoline, jet, and Diesel fuel range hydrocarbons.

Current methods for biomass utilization include biological conversion to produce ethanol and various <b>thermochemical</b> <b>routes</b> (gasification, pyrolysis, liquefaction, hydrothermal treatment, etc.). Furfural is one particular chemical that can be obtained from lignocellulosic biomass in good yields through the dehydration of sugar residues. It {{can be used as a}} feedstock for chemicals such as furan and THF, or as a platform molecule for making liquid fuels. The objective of this research is to investigate new pathways for the utilization of furfural in value-added products. In addition, heterogeneous oxorhenium catalysts were studied for deoxydehydration of vicinal diols, a reaction relevant to the conversion of biomass derived sugars. A cationic oxorhenium(V) oxazoline was studied for the catalytic condensation of diols or epoxides with aldehydes. Here, reactions were done under neat conditions and mild temperatures, achieving good to excellent yields of the 1, 3 -dioxolane products. The reaction conditions were then applied to the biorenewables furfural and glycerol, providing the first reported solvent-free condensation of these materials. Investigation into the stereoselectivity of the reaction reveals divergent pathways for the reaction of epoxides versus the analogous diol. The coupling of furfural with glycerol is further investigated. Neat conditions are developed to provide the cyclic acetal products, using simple Lewis acid salts and heterogeneous acid catalysts. Since the reaction is performed under neat conditions, novel reaction methods are studied in order to remove the water byproduct and drive the reaction forward. We found these reaction conditions to be applicable to crude glycerol. The resultant acetals were isolated and modified via hydrogenation and acetylation. These materials were then studied as blending agents with biodiesel, aiming to improve the low temperature properties. While no benefit was observed, the data does not preclude the use of these materials as additives in biodiesel. The homocoupling of furfural is then studied using the N-heterocyclic carbene catalyzed benzoin condensation. Here, green methods are focused on with the ultimate goal of realizing the two-step process of producing furfural and subsequently performing the homocoupling. The C 10 product, furoin, serves as a good platform for the production of alkane fuels, and several processes are investigated to reach this goal. Finally, the deoxydehydration of vicinal diols using oxorhenium catalysts is known using several methods with various reductants. A number of known heterogenous oxorhenium catalysts have been described and studied for oxidation type reactions. We prepared several of these catalysts and studied them for the known diol reduction reactions. However, good results were not obtained, with the rhenium either being inactive or exhibiting significant leaching from the support, hence limiting the recyclability of the catalyst material. ...|$|E

40|$|Summary The {{combined}} {{problems of}} too little fossil fuels {{to supply the}} world’s future energy needs and the possible negative environmental effects of carbon dioxide emissions which are coupled to their usage {{has led to the}} development of fuels based on solar energy. This research aimed at investigating the possibility of sustainably producing solar fuels from CO 2 on a large scale, as a way of meeting part of the global fuel demand and mitigating CO 2 -related climate change during the period 2010 - 2050. In this report, the CO 2 for the solar fuels was assumed to be derived from carbon capture at large point sources. A short review of carbon capture technology and a comparison with projected transport fuel emissions leads to the conclusion that the carbon capture potential relative to the fuel need was suffi-cient to make solar fuels a relevant option. A literature search of solar fuels resulted in 50 articles on CO 2 based solar fuels. The three main methods of producing solar fuels are through thermochemical, electrochemical and photochemical routes. All three methods use catalysts to drive the reaction of carbon dioxide (and water) to fuel or fuel precursors like syngas. Although catalysts are theoretically not consumed in the reaction, in practice they have a limited lifetime. Because some of the catalyst materials used are relatively scarce, the energy output per gram of the least available catalyst metal was determined. Using the production volume of the metal, the fuel production potential of the different routes based on metal availability could be determined. After estimating the cost of the fuel for each route (based on the cost of raw material), eight routes were selected for further analysis. The eight remaining routes, together with three alternative carbon mitigation options, namely carbon capture and storage, biofuels and electric vehicles, and a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario were com-pared on their impacts upon scaling up. For land use, the thermochemical and electrochemical solar fuel routes performed well compared to the alternatives. For CO 2 emissions, the solar fuels performed about the same as the alternative schemes, but showed an improvement over the BAU scenario. For material impact, cost and ease of implementation the solar fuels generally performed worse than the alternatives. Overall, some of the <b>thermochemical</b> <b>routes</b> and one electrochemical route performed better than carbon capture and storage and it was concluded that they were approaching commercialization. For further development of solar fuels it is necessary to reduce the cost of the best performing routes, to determine in more detail the material impacts of those routes and to ensure that carbon capture becomes a common practice. A carbon tax would benefit the implementation of solar fuels, as this would increase the cost of fossil fuels and make carbon capture more attractive. Air travel is an attractive sector for solar fuels in the future, because the sector needs a high quality fuel, which solar fuel technology should be able to provide in sufficient volume. ...|$|E

Hydrogen's share in the energy market is increasing {{with the implementation of}} fuel cell systems and the growing demand for zero-emission fuels. Hydrogen production will need to keep pace with this growing market. In the near term, increased production will likely be met by conventional technologies, such as natural gas reforming. In these processes, the carbon is converted to CO 2 and released to the atmosphere. However, with the growing concern about global climate change, alternatives to the atmospheric release of CO 2 are being investigated. Sequestration of the CO 2 is an option that could provide a viable near-term solution. Reducing the demand on fossil resources remains a significant concern for many nations. Renewable-based processes like solar- or wind-driven electrolysis and photobiological water splitting hold great promise for clean hydrogen production; however, advances must still be made before these technologies can be economically competitive. For the near-and mid-term, generating hydrogen from biomass may be the more practical and viable, renewable and potentially carbon-neutral (or even carbon-negative in conjunction with sequestration) option. Recently, the IEA Hydrogen Agreement launched a new task to bring together international experts to investigate some of these near- and mid-term options for producing hydrogen with reduced environmental impacts. This review {{of the state of the}} art of hydrogen production from biomass was prepared to facilitate in the planning of work that should be done to achieve the goal of near-term hydrogen energy systems. The relevant technologies that convert biomass to hydrogen, with emphasis on <b>thermochemical</b> <b>routes</b> are described. In evaluating the viability of the conversion routes, each must be put in the context of the availability of appropriate feedstocks and deployment scenarios that match hydrogen to the local markets. Co-production opportunities are of particular interest for near-term deployment since multiple products improve the economics; however, co-product development is not covered in this report. Biomass has the potential to accelerate the realization of hydrogen as a major fuel of the future. Since biomass is renewable and consumes atmospheric CO 2 during growth, it can have a small net CO 2 impact compared to fossil fuels. However, hydrogen from biomass has major challenges. There are no completed technology demonstrations. The yield of hydrogen is low from biomass since the hydrogen content in biomass is low to being with (approximately 6 % versus 25 % for methane) and the energy content is low due to the 40 % oxygen content of biomass. Since over half of the hydrogen from biomass comes from splitting water in the steam reforming reaction, the energy content of the feedstock is an inherent limitation of the process. The low yield of hydrogen on a weight basis is misleading since the energy conversion efficiency is high. However, the cost for growing, harvesting, and transporting biomass is high. Thus even with reasonable energy efficiencies, it is not presently economically competitive with natural gas steam reforming for stand-alone hydrogen without the advantage of high-value co-products. Additionally, as with all sources of hydrogen, production from biomass will require appropriate hydrogen storage and utilization systems to be developed and deployed. The report also looked at promising areas for further research and development. The major areas for R,D and D are: feedstock preparation and feeding; gasification gas conditioning; system integration; modular systems development; valuable co-product integration; and larger-scale demonstrations. These are in addition to the challenges for any hydrogen process in storage and utilization technologies...|$|E
40|$|Research in {{renewable}} energy is essential {{because of the}} limited supply of fossil fuel, particularly liquids, and the problem resulting from emissions of greenhouse gases, NOx and H₂S. For aviation/jet fuel, organic liquids cannot yet be replaced by electricity, solar cells, or gas. Currently, CO₂ emission from aviation fuels {{appears to be a}} small problem compared to that from road transport, but CO₂ emissions per passenger from fossil derived aviation fuel is actually higher than that from any other mode of transport. Therefore, it is important to look for a renewable substitute which will lead to less net CO₂ emission. The aim of this study has been to investigate and to develop <b>thermochemical</b> <b>routes</b> for the production of sustainable aviation fuels from various biomass sources. The work was focused on liquefaction under CO/H₂O with experiments under N₂ and H₂ for comparison and studied, mainly, the liquid fraction of the product. Widely different types of biomass were investigated to explore which biomass types gave high yield, high quality products as potential precursors to jet fuels. The feedstocks studied were poly-strain microalgae, single-strain microalgae (Chlorococcum sp.), grape marc, soft-wood (radiata pine), hard-wood (blue gum), and fossil wood (or woody coal) for comparison. The biomass types were analyzed by ultimate and proximate analyses, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), and by solid state 13 C NMR and, {{in the case of the}} algae, by hexane extraction. The biomass types were reacted in 27 mL, 70 mL and 100 mL autoclaves under N₂, H₂, N₂/H₂O, H₂/H₂O and CO/H₂O under a range of pressures (1, 3, 5 MPa (cold)) and temperatures (285 - 425 °C) and, in the case of reactions under CO, with a range of water to biomass ratios (1 : 1, 3 : 1). Catalysts (Na₂CO₃, NaAlO₂, Fe) impregnated into the biomass were added in the case of CO/H₂O reactions. Most experiments were carried out in a batch autoclave system but for comparison some were conducted in a semi-continuous or flow-through configuration. High yields of material soluble in dichloromethane (DCM) and in hexane were obtained under suitable conditions. Thermo-chemical reactions of algae produced significantly higher dichloromethane solubles and generally higher yields of oil and asphaltene than other feedstocks under the reaction conditions used. CO/H₂O tended to give higher yields than N₂, or H₂. CO/H₂O was only effective in improving product yields for biomass or feedstock containing a reasonable amount of carbonyl (-C=O) or free –OH groups. Catalysts added generally did not greatly increase the yield of DCM solubles but did increase the amount of oil (hexane solubles) and thus improved the quality of the products. Different types of biomass behaved differently in different reaction systems. In batch autoclaves, algae gave higher yields of DCM solubles than grape marc or radiata pine, but in the flow-through system, radiata pine gave the highest yields. Thus, the results from the batch autoclave system have to be treated with caution to predict what would happen in more realistic conditions. The DCM solubles and in the case of flow-through products, the condensate, were analysed by elemental analysis, ¹H and 13 C NMR, GC-MS and Py-GC/MS. The high heating value (HHV) of the DCM solubles and, in the case of flow-through reactions, of the organic phase of the condensate was always much higher than that of the original biomass. The DCM solubles always contained much less oxygen than the original biomass, but, in the case of algae and grape marc, which have a high nitrogen content, the DCM solubles and the organic phase of the condensate from flow-through reactions were always high in nitrogen, which would have to be removed in an upgrading step to obtain a useful fuel. The alkaline catalysts increased the atomic H/C ratio of the algal products and, at low temperatures, the proportion of product boiling in the jet fuel range. For grape marc, blue gum, radiata pine, and fossil wood catalysts reduced the oxygen content, at least partly by promoting decomposition of the fatty acids to hydrocarbons. The algal DCM solubles obtained at higher temperatures contained a large concentration of aliphatic hydrocarbons and also contained some indoles, phenols, aromatics, nitriles and amides. The grape marc products were intermediate between those from algae and radiata pine or blue gum. The radiata pine, blue gum and fossil wood products were more aromatic and contained few nitrogen compounds. Analysis of the DCM solubles using Py-GC/MS gave more representative results than ordinary GC-MS because some high boiling point, highly polar materials were not detectable by GC-MS. It also gave insight into the chemical transformations of the nitrogen compounds and some of the oxygen compounds in the original biomass during CO/H₂O reactions. The high product yields from algae liquefaction and the large concentration of aliphatic carbons in algal bio-oil indicated algae as the most promising sources of jet fuel, so that the oils derived from algae were subjected to hydrotreating to improve the quality of the products. Upgrading of the bio-oil derived from algae was attempted by hydrogenation in the presence of NiMo/Al-SBA- 15 catalysts. To obtain a uniform sample for upgrading, a large quantity of DCM solubles was prepared by multiple reactions in 100 mL autoclaves under N₂ at 355 ⁰C. Attempted upgrading by catalytic hydrogenation resulted in severe coking, particularly with less acidic supports (higher Si/Al ratio). Incorporation of NiMo reduced coking and increased the product yields to up to 65 wt. %. Non-catalytic hydrogenation reduced the nitrogen and oxygen content of the bio-oil significantly and adding catalysts had little effect on either. However, adding supports gave an increased fraction boiling in the jet fuel range (C₁₂ -C₁₇) consisting mainly of hydrocarbons. NiMo catalysts enhanced cracking and eliminated nitriles. The fraction boiling in the jet fuel range of the upgraded product was increased much more by adding NiMo to the supports, particularly when NiMo was deposited on more acidic Al-SBA- 15 and when the hydrogen pressure was increased. Under suitable conditions, up to 45 % of the upgraded product boiled in the jet fuel range. The main findings are that, of the biomass types reacted, algae are the most suitable starting point for jet fuel and under suitable conditions a high yield of oil can be obtained which can then be upgraded to a product with a reasonable proportion boiling in the jet fuel range. The NiMo catalysts greatly increased the proportion of product in the lower boiling point jet fuel range, by stabilizing products against repolymerization and by promoting cracking and decarboxylation of fatty acids. Thus the catalyst synthesized as described is useful. However, the extent of coking and the nitrogen content of the upgraded oil remained too high, so that improvement in experimental method, by e. g. altering the reactor design and/or by carrying out upgrading in several stages, would be required to obtain a practically useful fuel...|$|E
40|$|The {{projected}} {{decline in}} fossil fuel availability, environmental concerns, {{and security of}} supply attract increased interest in renewable energy derived from biomass. Fast pyrolysis is a possible <b>thermochemical</b> conversion <b>route</b> {{for the production of}} bio-oil, with promising advantages. The purpose of the experiments reported in this thesis was to extend our understanding of the fast pyrolysis process for straw, perennial grasses and hardwoods, and the implications of selective pyrolysis, crop harvest and storage on the thermal decomposition products. To this end, characterisation and laboratory-scale fast pyrolysis were conducted on the available feedstocks, and their products were compared. The variation in light and medium volatile decomposition products was investigated at different pyrolysis temperatures and heating rates, and a comparison of fast and slow pyrolysis products was conducted. Feedstocks from different harvests, storage durations and locations were characterised and compared in terms of their fuel and chemical properties. A range of analytical (e. g. Py-GC-MS and TGA) and processing equipment (0. 3 kg/h and 1. 0 kg/h fast pyrolysis reactors and 0. 15 kg slow pyrolysis reactor) was used. Findings show that the high bio-oil and char heating value, and low water content of willow short rotation coppice (SRC) make this crop attractive for fast pyrolysis processing compared to the other investigated feedstocks in this project. From the analytical sequential investigation of willow SRC, {{it was found that the}} volatile product distribution can be tailored to achieve a better final product, by a variation of the heating rate and temperature. Time of harvest was most influential on the fuel properties of miscanthus; overall the late harvest produced the best fuel properties (high HHV, low moisture content, high volatile content, low ash content), and storage of the feedstock reduced the moisture and acid content...|$|R
40|$|Biomass is very {{promising}} as a sustainable alternative to fossil resources {{because it is}} a renewable source that contains carbon, an essential building block for gaseous and liquid fuels. Methane is the main component of natural gas, which is a fuel used for heating, power generation and transportation. In The Netherlands, the contribution of natural gas to the primary energy consumption is almost 50 % (Source: Energy Research Centre of The Netherlands [ECN]) and it is a fuel with a well-developed pipeline distribution network and infrastructure. There are different biomass conversion routes to methane depending on the water content of the biomass feed. The <b>thermochemical</b> conversion <b>route</b> to convert relatively dry biomass into methane is conventionally envisaged in a two-step process: In the first step, biomass is gasified (with heat demand, high T / low P) and in the second step methane is formed (with heat release, low T / high P) in a separate reactor. In this configuration there is no heat integration possible between the two process stages. In this thesis, a new gasification concept is investigated, termed self-gasification, that overcomes, inter alia, the issue of heat integration. The concept entails an intermediate temperature (700 - 800 °C) and pressure (25 - 35 bar) steam gasifier, where recycled ash components -contained in the biomass itself- serve as potential “catalysts” for char (from biomass pyrolysis) gasification, methane formation, gas conditioning and tar cracking. The focus of the present research lies on process evaluation and study of the influence of biomass ashes on the aforementioned reactions. Ashes are present in different concentrations in targeted biomass feeds for gasification; ranging from ~ 0. 5 wt. % in “clean wood” to ~ 15 wt. % in chicken litter. For that reason alone, results presented in this thesis are not limited to the self-gasification concept where methane is the final product, but give valuable information for other biomass gasification processes as well. Subjects such as gasification under pressure, methane formation and the effect of naturally occurring ash in biomass are dealt with in this thesis. The concept is now ready to be studied in an integrated bench-scale unit for further evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Biomass as a {{renewable}} energy resource and a carbon neutral feedstock has a big potential to replace fossil fuel. Gasification as one of <b>thermochemical</b> process <b>routes</b> in biomass utilization draws attention with regards to its broad product range. The circulating fluidized bed with the advantages of higher and rapid conversion performs as the favorable type of reactor for the gasification process. Research of either model development or experimental study has been extensively carried out in characterizing the circulating fluidized bed biomass gasification to obtain an optimum set up. The two most commonly known classes of models for the circulating fluidized bed biomass gasification are equilibrium model and kinetic model. Despite its well-known advantage in providing the accuracy by the mechanistic approach, the model complexity should be paid off to compensate the proper result. Certain strategies are commonly elaborated in simplifying the model by introducing the empirical relation for certain conversion step or neglecting the less affecting phenomena of the model. Such simplification unavoidably limits the model flexibility into the certain application only. Regardless of its accuracy, the equilibrium modeling approach is famous with its flexibility application and is considered simpler than the kinetic one. Making use of the Gibbs free energy minimization as the thermodynamic equilibrium condition the model predicts the product compounds {{in response to the}} operating conditions. The global equilibrium consideration causes the poor accuracy of the model since there is a limitation in achieving such condition for the actual conversion process conditions. Introducing the experimentally based constraints is noticed in several published papers as an improvement in correcting the model global equilibrium condition for the better representation of the actual process. The improvement opens the possibility to upgrade the model accuracy. In this master thesis, the extent of the constrained equilibrium model is examined among developed models and experimental data by developing the most robust constraint cases in predicting the product compounds. Several methods were performed in determining such constraints in representing the actual process. The carbon conversion together with the CH 4 amount from related gasification and devolatilization experiment were chosen to be the constraints for the major gasses prediction. Meanwhile, carbon conversion and 4 major gasses amount (H 2, CH 4, CO, CO 2) were selected to correct the model global equilibrium in predicting the formed tar species. The selected constraint cases were introduced in the equilibrium model in performing the prediction for the case study on torrefied and non-torrefied circulating fluidized bed biomass gasification campaign 100 kWth test rig at TU Delft. The major gasses prediction among cases varies from the good agreement of H 2 /CO ratio and Lower Heating Value of the product gas to the roughly approximated 30 % mole fraction average difference to the experimental data. The model predicted 13 species of tar from 25 considered species. From the 15 species analyzed in the experimental data, 10 predicted species are in qualitatively good agreement. The total tar and BTX tar prediction are in quantitative agreement with the experimental data. Mechanical, Maritime and Materials EngineeringProcess and Energ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Process Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: A techno-economic {{feasibility}} study {{was performed to}} compare biological and <b>thermochemical</b> process <b>routes</b> for production of liquid biofuels from sugarcane bagasse in South Africa using process modelling. Processing of sugarcane bagasse {{for the production of}} bioethanol, pyrolysis oil or Fischer-Tropsch liquid fuels were identified as relevant for this case study. For each main process route, various modes or configurations were evaluated, and in total eleven process scenarios were modelled, for which fourteen economic models were developed to include different scales of biomass input. Although detailed process modelling of various biofuels processes has been performed for other (mainly first world) countries, comparative studies have been very limited and mainly focused on mature technology. This is the first techno-economic case study performed for South Africa to compare these process routes using data for sugarcane bagasse. The technical and economic performance of each process route was investigated using the following approach: Obtain reliable data sets from literature for processing of sugarcane bagasse via biological pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation, fast and vacuum pyrolysis, and equilibrium gasification to be sufficient for process modelling. Develop process models for eleven process scenarios to compare their energy efficiencies and product yields. In order to reflect currently available technology, conservative assumptions were made where necessary and the measured data collected from literature was used. The modelling was performed to reflect energy-self-sufficient processes by using the thermal energy available as a source of heat and electricity for the process. Develop economic models using cost data available in literature and price data and economic parameters applicable to South Africa. Compare the three process routes using technical and economic results obtained from the process and economic models and identify the most promising scenarios. For bioethanol production, experimental data was collected for three pretreatment methods, namely steam explosion, dilute acid and liquid hot water pretreatment performed at pretreatment solids concentrations of 50 wt%, 10 wt% and 5 wt%, respectively. This was followed by enzymatic hydrolysis and separate co-fermentation. Pyrolysis data for production of bio-oil via fast and vacuum pyrolysis was also collected. For gasification, data was generated via equilibrium modelling based on literature that validated the method against experimental data for sugarcane bagasse gasification. The equilibrium model was used to determine optimum gasification conditions for either gasification efficiency or syngas composition, using sugarcane bagasse, fast pyrolysis slurry or vacuum pyrolysis slurry as feedstock. These results were integrated with a downstream process model for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to evaluate the effect of upstream optimisation on the process energy efficiency and economics, and the inclusion of a shift reactor was also evaluated. The effect of process heat integration and boilers with steam turbine cycles to produce process heat and electricity, and possibly electricity by-product, was included for each process. This analysis assumed that certain process units could be successfully scaled to commercial scales at the same yields and efficiencies determined by experimental and equilibrium modelling data. The most important process units that need to be proven on an industrial scale are pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation for bioethanol production, the fast pyrolysis and vacuum pyrolysis reactors, and the operation of a twostage gasifier with nickel catalyst at near equilibrium conditions. All of these process units have already been proven on a bench scale with sugarcane bagasse as feedstock. The economic models were based on a critical evaluation of equipment cost data available in literature, and a conservative approach was taken to reflect 1 st plant technology. Data for the cost and availability of raw materials was obtained from the local industry and all price data and economic parameters (debt ratio, interest and tax rates) were applicable to the current situation in South Africa. A sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the effects of likely market fluctuations on the process economics. A summary of the technical and economic performances of the most promising scenarios is shown in the table below. The bioethanol process models showed that the liquid hot water and dilute acid pretreatment scenarios are not energy self-sufficient and require additional fossil energy input to supply process energy needs. This is attributed to the excessive process steam requirements for pretreatment and conditioning due to the low pretreatment solid concentrations of 5 wt% and 10 wt%, respectively. The critical solids concentration during dilute acid pretreatment for an energy selfsufficient process was found to be 35 %, although this was a theoretical scenario and the data needs to be verified experimentally. At a pretreatment level of 50 % solids, steam explosion achieved the highest process thermal energy efficiency for bioethanol of 55. 8 %, and a liquid fuel energy efficiency of 40. 9 %. Both pyrolysis processes are energy self-sufficient, although some of the char produced by fast pyrolysis is used to supplement the higher process energy demand of fast compared to vacuum pyrolysis. The thermal process energy efficiencies of both pyrolysis processes are roughly 70 % for the production of crude bio-oil that can be sold as a residual fuel oil. However, the liquid fuel energy efficiency of fast pyrolysis is 66. 5 %, compared to 57. 5 % for vacuum pyrolysis, since fast pyrolysis produces more bio-oil and less char than vacuum pyrolysis.

40|$|The {{need for}} sustainability, energy {{security}} and reduction {{of global warming}} has brought many alternative energy sources into the foreground. Already there are well established technologies that can produce renewable energy {{but when it comes}} to the production of renewable liquid fuels and chemicals, biomass is the primary feedstock. Biomass is a renewable source of energy that can provide heat, electricity and transport fuels. However, utilisation of biomass posses some limitations such as land availability and competition of energy crops with food crops. In order to overcome these problems "third generation" biofuels from alternative feedstock such as macro-algae have recently come into the foreground. Oceans and seas cover over 70 % of the earth's surface, most of which is under exploited, resulting in additional potential for biomass production. This thesis concentrates on the potential for production of bio-energy and chemicals from macro-algae through thermochemical processes such as pyrolysis, combustion and hydrothermal liquefaction. Utilisation of aquatic biomass for production of bioenergy is a very recent concept and there is a lack of information on their thermochemical behaviour. This investigation contributes to a wider study and forms part of the Supergen II bionergy programme investigating the potential for utilisation of macrolage in the UK. This investigation includes a detailed characterisation of the fuel properties and thermal behaviour of a range of wild seaweeds around the UK provided by the Scottish Association of Marine Sciences. In addition, a range of model biochemical components have been investigated, in particular, the model carbohydrates present in macro-algae. Alginic acid, mannitol, laminarin, fucoidan and cellulose are the main carbohydrates present in brown macro-algae. The rest of the plant material comprises of protein and ash. Freshly harvested macro-algae contain 80 - 90 wt% moisture. Their ash content is high, reflecting their high inorganic content. Potassium is the most abundant metal present in macro-algae although other metals are also present including sodium, calcium, magnesium, Their carbohydrate, protein and ash content undergo a seasonal variation during their growth cycle. This variation was found to affect their properties as fuel. Carbon content reaches its maximum during summer - early autumn. During the same period, the inorganic (and thus ash) content is at its minimum suggesting summer - early autumn as the optimum period for harvesting macro-algae for bioenergy. The high carbon and low inorganic content during this period is reflected in its higher heating value but it is still relatively low (13 - 14 MJ/kg) when compared with terrestrial biomass. The nature of the inhabitant location was found to significantly influence macro-algae fuel properties with samples grown in the open ocean having better fuel properties (higher HHV and lower inorganic content) than samples growing in canals and estuaries. Investigation of the pyrolysis behaviour was performed using thermal analysis such as TGA and Py-GC/MS. The volatile matter evolved during pyrolysis was higher for samples collected during summer and early spring due to their higher carbon content. The main volatiles evolved during decomposition were found to originate either from their carbohydrates or from their protein content. Specific marker compounds were identified for the carbohydrates such as dianhydromannitol, 1 -(2 -furanyl) -ethanone, 2 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl- 2 -cyclopenten- 1 -one and furfural for manitol, laminarin and alginic acid respectively. Proteins are found to produce a range of indoles and pyrroles. Some of the compounds identified may have industrial applications indicating the possibility of producing chemicals through pyrolysis of macro-algae. The high moisture content of seaweed necessitates that significant amounts of water must be removed before this feedstock can be converted by pyrolysis. The high moisture content is similary an issue for combustion which has been assessed by a combination of TGA and characterisation of the biomass. Macro-algae have a low HHV, high halogen content and high ash content and are predicted to have high slagging and fouling behaviour in conventional combustion chambers. This fouling behaviour is predicted through empirical indexes such as the alkali index and is shown to be higher than terrestrial biomass even during summer - early autumn when their inorganic content is at minimum. Typical ash contents vary from 18 to 45 wt% and contain mainly oxides of K 20, Na 2 O, CaO and MgO. Pre-treatment prior to combustion can significantly reduce the ash content leading to improved combustion properties, but this also leads to removal of some biochemical components. Using an acid pre-treatment, some of the seaweed's biopolymers, such as mannitol or fucoidan, can be removed presenting the possibility for acquiring valuable chemicals from seaweed before combustion of the residue. An alternative processing route, capable of processing wet feedstocks called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) involves the processing of the macro-algae in subcritical water. HTL converts the starting material into four product streams including a bio-crude, a char, an aqueous stream consisting primarily of process water and a gaseous stream. A parametric study of HTL has been investigated using high pressure batch reactors with or without the presence of catalysts. The bio-crude produced from the liquefaction of macrolgae was found to have a high heating value and resembling chemical composition to crude-oil. It can be used directly as a fuel however it still contains significantly high nitrogen levels and will required suitable upgrading (e. g. denitrogenation). The bio-char was found to also have a high heating value. Both bio-crude and bio-char produced from HTL are virtually free of alkali metals suggesting they are suitable for combustion. Reaction conditions such as temperature and the ratio of biomass to water have the greatest influence on product yields and properties. Typical bio-crude yields were in the range of 10 to 19 wt% on a daf basis with their HHVs ranging from 32 to 38 MJ/kg. The yields of bio-chars were in similar range (IOwt% to 19 wt% on a db) with HHVs between 10 and 26 MJ/kg. An energy balance was calculated in order to investigate the energy required to heat the mixture of macro-algae and water. The energy recovery in the bio-crude and bio-char was relatively low, between 50 and 65 %, indicating that a significant portion of the energy content of macro-algae is passing in to the other product streams. The aqueous phase (process water) was found to be rich in metals, especially alkali metals, and sugars, and its composition suggests it maybe possible to utilize it as a fertilizer. A fraction of the sugars present in macro algae (mannitol and laminarin) pass in to the aqueous stream, suggesting there is also potential for fermentetion to bioethanol. The gaseous stream is composed mainly of CO 2, N, CO and lower concentrationso H and CH 4. The most suitable <b>thermochemical</b> processing <b>route</b> for macro-algae is proposed to be hydrothermal liquefaction and has potential for utilization of all the product streams producing fuels and chemicals using a bio-refinery concept.

40|$|Depleting {{reserves}} {{of natural resources}} and the deleterious effects of fossil fuel burning on the environment have led to great interest in developing renewable fuels. Biomass represents a promising renewable material for biofuels, electricity, heat, chemicals and biochar production. Consequently research has focused on aspects of biomass conversion that currently act as bottle necks to commercial development including: (i) feedstock development, (ii) selection of biomass conversion technologies, and (iii) development of large scale reactor systems. Presently, the production of biofuels from waste biomass, wood chips, forestry and agricultural residues through <b>thermochemical</b> and/or biochemical <b>routes</b> are the leading process strategies in many countries. Significant improvements in process can therefore be expected, thus making large-scale biofuels production from lignocellulosic biomass substrates possible. Currently, non-edible bioresources including non-edible oil seeds are emerging as a potential feed-stock for the biofuel industry, as both oil and seed residues can be exploited to produce biofuels. Non-edible resources have the advantage of not interfering with food supply and food pricing, or impacting on land use for feedstock supply to achieve sustainable biofuels production. Pongamia pinnata, a non-edible, drought resistant tree is capable of adaptation to different climatic conditions. It belongs to the legume family and is distributed in Asia, Australia and the Pacific Islands. P. pinnata seeds are composed of 30 - 35 % oil which represents a precursor for biodiesel production and has been widely studied as a potential renewable feedstock. The de-oiled seed residue is of current interest in terms of bioethanol, bio-oil and biochar production. The annual yield of the seeds reached 200, 000 metric tons from India alone. P. pinnata seeds costs around $ 0. 06 kg- 1 and the selling price of oil extracted from the seeds is $ 0. 06 L- 1 ($ 0. 065 kg- 1) which makes the cost of the seed residue almost insignificant in the process, making the seed residue an economical feed-stock. In this study a range of issues in the conversion of the seed residue to biofuels were investigated. The value addition of P. pinnata de-oiled seed residue was carried out using chemical (acid hydrolysis), enzymatic (enzymatic hydrolysis) and thermal (pyrolysis) treatments. In {{the first part of this}} study, chemical hydrolysis of the seed residue was carried out in the presence of sulphuric acid together with analysis of the composition of the seed residue in terms of ash (6. 7 %), lignin (29 %), protein (22. 3 %) and total carbohydrates (42 %). The main objective of this study was aimed at testing the seed residue for the production of glucose by acid hydrolysis in the presence of sulphuric acid and to prove the potential of the seed residue as a promising feedstock for biofuels production. The Taguchi robust design method with L 9 orthogonal array was applied to optimize hydrolysis reaction conditions in order to maximize the glucose yield. The effect of temperature (80, 100 and 120 ⁰C), acid concentration (2. 5, 5 and 7. 5 %), and liquid to seed residue weight ratio (10, 15 and 20) were considered as the main influencing factors which affects the formation of glucose. From the study it was observed that acid concentration and temperature had a principal effect on the amount of glucose formed when compared to that of the liquid to solid ratio. The maximum glucose formed was 245 g/kg seed residue. This work demonstrated the effects of different operating conditions on glucose production and the potential of the seed residue for sugar production for further application in biofuel production. The second part of this study explores the effect of different acids including hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) and phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4) on sugars yield from hydrolysis of de-oiled P. pinnata seed residue and the application of sugars obtained for ethanol production in a three step process: acid treatment; neutralization and fermentation. The Taguchi robust design of experiments method was employed to study the effects of the parameters for biomass pretreatment, including acid type (H 2 SO 4, HCl, H 3 PO 4), acid concentration (2 - 6 %), and temperature (80 - 100 ⁰C) on the formation of sugars during acid hydrolysis. Acid concentration and temperature showed a positive effect on sugar release from the biomass with hydrochloric acid the best catalyst for acid hydrolysis. The energy required for this pretreatment process using HCl was estimated, to get an insight into the process energy demand (1080 - 1110 KJ kg- 1). Downstream processing before fermentation for ethanol production included neutralization of the hydrolyzate to pH 4. 8. Addition of alkali in the neutralization step influenced sugar concentration in terms of g sugar per litre of neutralized product together with the salts formed and the time required for complete conversion of sugars to ethanol during fermentation. The results indicated that fermentation of 2 %, 4 % and 6 % HCl treatment followed by neutralization gave 67. 52, 74. 98 and 88. 62 g ethanol kg- 1 dry seed cake, respectively, corresponding to ~ 31. 45 %, 34. 92 % and 41. 28 % of the theoretical ethanol formation (214 g kg- 1). The work demonstrated the selection of the best catalyst, determined the energy requirement of the acid hydrolysis process, and confirmed the potential of the seed residue as a feed-stock for ethanol production. In the third part of this study, the enzymatic hydrolysis method was tested for sugar production from P. pinnata seed residue for further application in ethanol production. Currently the costs associated with lignocellulases represent a key limiting factor in the development of biomass enzymatic conversion processes. The main aim of this work was to exploit the seed residue for both lignocellulase enzymes and ethanol production. Spingomonas echinoides (isolated from P. pinnata seed residue) and Iprex lacteus (obtained from RMIT culture collection) were selected as novel sources of lignocellulases during solid state fermentation. Both organisms produced an array of lignocellulases including exoglucanase, endoglucanase, xylanase and laccase with activities of 3. 9, 2. 7, 0. 8, 0. 116 U ml- 1 min- 1 and 5. 2, 8. 2, 2. 7, 0. 129 U mL- 1 min- 1 for S. echinoides and I. lacteus, respectively. P. pinnata seed residue (5 %, w/v) in sodium citrate buffer (pH 4. 8) was pretreated at 121 ⁰C for 15 min. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated seed residue was carried out at 50 ⁰C with mixing at 150 rpm. Subsequent hydrolysis of the pretreated seed residue using the crude enzyme preparation from S. echinoides and I. lacteus reported appreciable sugars yields of 233 and 302 mg g- 1 seed residue respectively, at 10 U g- 1 enzyme concentrations. The yields from crude enzyme treatment were further compared with that from commercial cellulase from Aspergillus niger (330 mg g- 1 seed residue). The three sugar-containing liquid products from the enzymatic hydrolysis of P. pinnata seed residue using crude enzyme prepared from S. echinoides (SE), I. lacteus (IL) and cellulase from A. niger (AN) were fermented using Saccharomyces cerevisiae under anaerobic conditions at 35 ⁰C. Ethanol yields of 81. 5, 104. 5 and 157. 6 mg g- 1 and final ethanol concentrations of 4. 0, 5. 3 and 7. 9 mg mL- 1 were observed from SE, IL and AN fermentations respectively, which correspond to 38 %, 49 % and 73 % of the theoretical ethanol yield, respectively. The study demonstrated the feasibility of using the seed residue for enzyme preparation for application in hydrolysis reactions and the potential of using the hydrolysis product for ethanol production. In the fourth part of this study thermal treatment of the seed residue was carried out under pyrolysis conditions. The aim of the work was to obtain kinetic parameters in relation to technological parameters in the conversion of non-edible seed residue biomass to bio-oil and bio-char by pyrolysis. The effects of heating rate on seed residue pyrolysis and kinetic parameters were investigated at heating rates of 5, 10, and 20 &deg;C/min using thermogravimetric analysis. Thermogravimetric experiments showed that the onset and offset temperatures of the devolatilization step shifted towards the high-temperature range, and the activation energy values increased with increasing heating rate. In the present study iso-conversional methods (model free and model fitting methods) were applied in estimating the activation energies (118 - 124 KJ mol- 1) and the pre-exponential factors using progressive conversion, obtained by thermogravimetric analysis. The model free methods, Kissenger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) and Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW), and the model fitting Coats and Redfern method (CRF) gave reliable activation energies and pre-exponential factors with a third order reaction model for the seed residue pyrolysis reaction. The pyrolysis reactions in the thermogravimetric analyzer at constant heating rate revealed a temperature of 450 - 500 &deg;C was sufficient for carbonization of the biomass. Thermal treatment of the seed residue under pyrolysis conditions was performed in a fixed bed reactor at different temperatures including 350, 400, 450 and 500 ⁰C. Proximate-ultimate analyses, energy value, surface structure and Fourier transformed infrared spectra of the processed biomass (biochar) were reported. Pyrolysis resulted in an increase in the heating value of the seed residue biomass from 18. 1 to 24. 5 MJ kg- 1 with the heating value of biooil determined as 33. 38 MJ kg- 1; importantly biochar exhibited high carbon and low oxygen content. The approach represents a novel method for upgrading the seed residue resulting in a biochar which has significant commercial potential as a biosorbent for industrial effluent treatment. The results obtained from the study have made an important contribution in value addition of the inedible and low cost bio-resource, de-oiled Pongamia pinnata seed residue. The scientific knowledge obtained from the present study can be useful in solving the technical barriers involved in biofuel preparation from the seed residue...|$|R
40|$|This PhD Thesis {{analyses}} {{the technical}} and economic feasibility of the gasification {{of one of the}} most promising energy crops in terms of biomass yield and plantation costs: Cynara cardunculus L. (cynara). The aim of this analysis is to assess the bioenergy production via fluidized bed gasification (FBG) and the ulterior treatment of the synthesis gas (syngas) produced in the FBG reactor to adequate it to end-use applications such as gas turbines and internal combustion engines. To achieve this objective, this thesis proposes a formulation model approach for evaluating the electricity generation costs (Chapter 2), the reactor performance (Chapter 3) and the syngas conditioning efficiency (Chapter 4). For this purpose, the Autonomous Community of Madrid (CAM) has been taken as study case. The analysis estimates that the cynara has the potential to provide 1708 GWh yr- 1, that is, around 42 % of national biomass-based electricity supply and exceeds 72 % of total renewable-based electricity supply in CAM. Therefore, the implementation of cynara projects could help reducing the total energy consumption of CAM by 0. 05 %, what would suppose to avoid up to 66 % of CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels. The economic assessment performed in the present work evaluates the use of two thermochemical technologies for cynara conversion into electricity to be used for different applications or sold to the national grid. The technological solutions considered are: a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant and an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) power generator. The CCGT solution was studied for an installed capacity range of 5 - 30 MW, while the ICE solution was analysed for a range of 1 - 30 MW. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the effects of variables such as biomass yield, discount rate, transport cost, operation and maintenance. For a cynara yield of 17 t/ha in an 8 MW plant as base case, the economic analysis estimates a production costs of 21. 60 c€/kWh and 24. 32 c€/kW for the CCGT and ICE solutions, respectively. Accordingly, CCGT plants are the best choice for a plant size above 8 MW, while ICE plants constitute the most suitable technology below 8 MW. With regards to the discount rate, the results show that for the same base case (8 MW), for a discount rate of 10 % the cost of electricity is estimated to be 16. 69 c€/kWh for CCGT plants and 19. 08 c€/kWh for ICE plants. On the contrary, the use of the lowest discount rate (1 %) yields a cost of electricity of 12. 70 and 15. 13 c€/kWh for CCGT and ICE solutions, respectively. Concerning to the total capital investment, it grows with the plant size, representing up to 93 and 92 % of the total CCGT and ICE plant cost, respectively. Such percentages correspond to 42. 17 M€ and 41. 46 M€ for a CCGT and ICE plant for a base case of 8 MW. Nevertheless, the ICE plants show a stronger economy of scale in energy production than the CCGT solution. In addition to this, the total operating costs for an 8 MW CCGT scenario is estimated to be 2. 94 M€ and around 3. 65 M€ for an ICE plant. In relation to the <b>thermochemical</b> conversion <b>route</b> of cynara, the gasification of biomass in a FB reactor has been modelled to analyse such process for Cynara cardunculus L. taking into consideration the particular biomass behavior. It is well known that the FB reactor thermal state and the biomass volatiles generation are crucial in its operation and performance. Hence, the bubble flow pattern controls the FB temperature profile driving devolatilization and tars cracking kinetics. This underlies in the fact that alkali compounds of biomass fuels, which are featured by a low melting point, can transform into vapours and ash fly that are prone to deposit on heat surfaces in boilers and/or react with the particles of the inert bed material inside the FB. Thus, the formation of agglomerates (the so-called bed agglomeration) would start and then, the defluidization of FB leading to the shut-down of the FBG reactor. Therefore, a modelling approach focused on the bubble phase, which can act as “bypassing” hot spots inside the FB region influencing on ash-related problems, can help to monitor the location of ash sintering and bed agglomeration risk regions and predict undesired FBG reactor performance. A new formulation for biomass FBG reactor modelling that considers the instantaneous devolatilization and temperature peaks due to volatiles combustion inside the FB region is proposed in the present work. A bubble phase and a FB energy balance are used to monitor the gradual release of biomass volatiles along the FB and to check the performance of the FBG reactor. The one-dimensional, steady-state proposed model uses a two-phase (bubble and emulsion) and two zone (bottom dense bed and upper freeboard) modelling approach to account for the complex nature of FBG reactor dynamics. Furthermore, no catalytic effects of ash composition from biomass are taken into consideration. For further validation and tuning up of the model proposed, a sensitivity analysis of cynara gasification in FB, under bubbling regime, was performed considering the specification design of the pilot-plant scale FBG reactor in the Thermal and Fluid Engineering Department facilities at Carlos III University of Madrid. The simulation campaign yields a syngas composition (on dry basis) of 4. 79 - 14. 84 % for CO, 19. 77 - 21. 35 % for CO 2, 6. 11 - 15. 00 % for H 2 and 2. 16 - 5. 73 % for CH 4. Besides, the lower heating value and tar content of the syngas fall in the range of 2. 25 - 6. 25 MJ/Nm 3 and 60 - 180 g/Nm 3, respectively. These results correspond to a syngas-biomass flows ratio in the range of 1. 309 - 2. 392 Nm 3 /kg, accounting for N 2 in the raw syngas produced. The analysis of the results in comparison with previous experiments stands out: 1) the good predictive capability of the model proposed and 2) the discrepancies between simulations and experimental works are attributable to the data heterogeneity found in the literature, that is, different biomass compositions, operating conditions, (catalytic) bed material used, sampling methods for syngas and tar compositions, etc. Hence, further experimental research would help improving the predictive capability of the proposed model. Finally, the conditioning of the syngas produced from the FBG reactor is needed in order to achieve end-use requirements in ICE and gas turbines (GT) plants, since the lack or inefficiency of syngas clean-up could lead to operational problems in downstream equipment and then, unscheduled shut-down and extra maintenance and repair costs. For example, particulate material can cause clogging and fouling, while tars can condensate producing blockage and attrition in filters, exit pipes, heat exchangers, etc. Furthermore, the syngas treatment to reduce its pollutants would influence the performance, investment and operational costs of the gas cleaning devices. Nowadays, gas cleaning systems are aimed to reduce particulate and tars material levels below the allowable concentrations (mg/Nm 3) for ICE and GT devices: 50 - 50 and 30 - 5, respectively. Thus, as a part of the present thesis, the modelling and analysis of a moving bed heat exchange filter (MBHEF) is proposed as hot gas clean-up equipment. The MBHEF stands out because its benefits: high temperature operation (700 - 800 ºC the exhaust gas temperature from the FB reactor), no-clogging and non-pressure increase during operation, which can lead to unscheduled shut-down if using other typical hot gas cleaning devices such as ceramic filters, bag filters. Additionally, the MBHEF would provide a high contact area between gas and solids without entrainment nor elutriation of solids. This compact size equipment would allow saving costs. Eventually, the MBHEF solution for hot gas cleaning would also avoid extra costs derived from the reactor design modification and the use of additives/catalysts in order to remove tars. It is presented a modelling approach for simulating tars and particulate removal in a MBHEF. The two-dimension, adiabatic, steady-state proposed model accounts for twophase (gas and solid) and neglects conduction and mass diffusion. Tars condensation is modelled through representative tar class lumps: phenol (class 2), naphthalene (class 4), and pyrene (class 5) according to the literature. The model also considers tar concentration influence on tar dew point, while the filtration model is taken from literature. Furthermore, an exergy study was conducted in order to optimise the equipment size and help the choice of the less expensive operating conditions. A sensitivity analysis was performed varying the particle size and superficial gas velocity as key operating parameters. To accomplish this, a syngas composition from experiments reported in the literature has been taken as study case. Thus, maps of temperature, tars abatement and particulate removal efficiencies are presented, which show the MBHEF performance for reducing impurities content. The simulation results indicate the feasibility of use a MBHEF as tars removal equipment benefiting its advantages against other gas-cleaning methods with acceptable pollutant removal efficiencies, ranging 88 - 94 %. As observed, the MBHEF yields efficiencies, at least, the same order of magnitude of the ones attainable with the use of catalytic crackers, venture scrubbers or sand filter at much lower temperatures and higher than the ones achieved by means of wash towers, wet electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters and fixed bed absorbers. In case of not reaching the reduction level for each end-use application, the MBHEF device can be used as effective secondary removal method for eliminating tars from the syngas, with the advantages stated above as opposed the rest of removal technologies. Results also point out that low gas velocities (0. 5 - 1 m/s) and high particle size (400 - 700 μm) for saving costs are the most suitable|$|R
