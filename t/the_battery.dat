5|$|General Motors {{explained}} the modifications {{will enhance the}} vehicle structure that surround <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> and <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> coolant system to improve battery protection after a severe crash. The safety enhancements consist of strengthening an existing portion of the Volt’s vehicle safety structure to further protect <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> pack in a severe side collision; add a sensor in the reservoir of <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> coolant system to monitor coolant levels; and add a tamper-resistant bracket {{to the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> coolant reservoir to help prevent potential coolant overfill. The additional side safety structural pieces have a total weight of , and their function is to spread the load of a severe side impact away from <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> pack, reducing the possibility of intrusion into the pack.|$|E

The battalion was divided into four assault groups, one for each of the casemates of <b>the</b> <b>battery,</b> and was ready by 04:30, when the gliders carrying the sappers arrived over <b>the</b> <b>battery.</b>|$|E

5|$|In August 1942 No. 3 Commando was {{involved}} in the ill-fated Operation Jubilee, an exploratory raid on Dieppe in France. The plan called for a frontal assault on the port by the Canadian 2nd Division. Before this would take place, however, Troops from No. 3 and 4 Commandos would land at beaches on the eastern and western flanks and neutralise two German artillery batteries that were covering the main anchorage. No. 3 Commando was assigned the task of attacking the Goebbels Battery, landing on the eastern flank, under Durnford-Slater's command. <b>The</b> <b>battery</b> was located near Berneval-le-Grand, about half a mile from the sea with steep cliffs in front of it. It was decided that No. 3 Commando would land on two beaches to the east and west of <b>the</b> <b>battery,</b> from which gullies rose towards <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> and which would provide concealment while the Commandos approached <b>the</b> <b>battery.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} design <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> box and air {{reservoirs}} were located {{forward of the}} fuel tank; in locomotives manufactured after 1977 these were relocated behind the tank. <b>The</b> <b>battery</b> box returned to its original location in the F40PH-2.

5|$|No. 4 Commando {{made the}} {{crossing}} to Dieppe on board HMS Prins Albert. The crossing was uneventful and at 04:50 just before daybreak Group one landed unopposed. Using two Bangalore torpedos to blow {{a hole in}} the barbed wire, they managed to scale the cliffs. As they approached <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> at 05:45 it opened fire on the main landing force coming ashore at Dieppe. This was 30 minutes before Group one was expected {{to be in a position}} but Mills-Roberts responded by speeding up the advance to get their guns into action sooner. Once in position they opened fire on <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> with their mortars, Bren machine guns and sniper rifles. One of the mortar bombs landed inside <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> and exploded the stored charges, putting the guns out of action.|$|E

5|$|On 7June, <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> was {{assaulted}} {{again by}} two troops of commandos from No. 3 Commando, {{part of the}} 1st Special Service Brigade. The attack in daylight was repulsed with heavy losses to the commandos. As they withdrew, they were engaged by the battery's guns firing over open sights. The British never succeeded in completely destroying <b>the</b> <b>battery,</b> and it remained under German control until 17August, when the German Army started to withdraw from France.|$|E

The study is focused in <b>the</b> <b>batteries,</b> <b>the</b> most sensitive part of the satellite to the temperature, trying to find the best solution to make them remain operational during the satellite life, maintaining a good performance.

This research shows us that <b>the</b> <b>batteries</b> can work correctly without losing performance between 0 - 50 ºC. In the second part the different energies that influence the satellite are calculated to finish calculating the temperature of the satellite in different moments of the orbit. Afterwards the zone of the satellite where <b>the</b> <b>batteries</b> are located is studied to know the amount of heat needed to maintain <b>the</b> <b>batteries</b> in acceptable temperatures.

30|$|It can be {{seen that}} the output power of <b>the</b> <b>batteries</b> does not have the sudden and large {{variations}} because the ultra-capacitors buffer the power fluctuations, and in particular they deliver power to compensate the WT cut-off due to high winds at 14 : 00.

5|$|As CTroop {{reached the}} forming up {{point for the}} assault it met heavy machine gun fire from the gun battery. ATroop {{bypassed}} them to occupy houses to cover the assault. The next to arrive was DTroop, which had a special ladder to cross the anti-tank ditch around <b>the</b> <b>battery.</b> Realising that the man carrying the ladder had been killed crossing the beach and the ladder left behind, they looked for another way to cross.

5|$|At 02:30 on 1 May, a C-47 of 317 Tactical Control Squadron USAAF {{departed}} for Rangoon carrying a twenty-man pathfinder team, {{followed by a}} CCG plane carrying a pair of VCP, to mark and defend the landing zone at Tawhai. The rest of the composite battalion boarded thirty-eight Dakotas and took off thirty minutes later, and at 05:45 jumped over the drop zone; {{there were only a}} few casualties, one being a medical officer attached to the battalion. It encountered no Japanese opposition, and after it had rallied, advanced towards Elephant Point and the artillery battery. It halted 3,000 yards in front of <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> to allow B-24 Liberators from the USAAF to carry out a preliminary bombing attack on <b>the</b> <b>battery.</b> Unfortunately, despite officers and other ranks wearing yellow recognition panels and carrying orange umbrellas to identify themselves, C Company was bombed and strafed by the bombers, causing a number of casualties.
