[...] The New York Dramatic Mirror praised the production and commented on the clear adaptation of Shakespeare's work, resulting in an unusually clear presentation of the story. Another review in The Moving Picture World praised the film in a follow-up to the first review, commenting on the ephemeral nature of the productions by saying [...] "Few, indeed, will be the releases of the month to surpass this, and few, indeed, are <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>that</b> seem so complete and in every way satisfactory." ...|$|E

2500|$|After his {{departure}} from Falcon Crest, MacCorkindale {{returned to the}} United Kingdom in 1986 to form a production company. The following year, he established Amy International Artists, based at Shepperton Studios, with his wife Susan George, and also Apollo Films International. He subsequently directed, wrote and produced a number of projects for Amy International, including the film Stealing Heaven (1988) (concerning the medieval French philosopher Abelard and his passion for Heloise), and the film Djavolji Raj (1989) (That Summer of White Roses), which stars George and features romantic theme music composed by MacCorkindale. MacCorkindale and George purchased the rights to each project because they wished to [...] "make <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>that</b> we just totally and literally believe in", regardless of their commercial success.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{probably}} in 1868 that Mussorgsky first met artist, architect, and designer Viktor Hartmann, {{not long after the}} latter's return to Russia from abroad. Both men were devoted to the cause of an intrinsically Russian art and quickly became friends. They likely met in the home of the influential critic Vladimir Stasov, who followed both of their careers with interest. According to Stasov's testimony, in 1868, Hartmann gave Mussorgsky two of <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>that</b> later formed the basis of Pictures at an Exhibition. In 1870, Mussorgsky dedicated the second song ("In the Corner") of the cycle The Nursery to Hartmann. Stasov remarked that Hartmann loved Mussorgsky's compositions, and particularly liked the [...] "Scene by the Fountain" [...] in his opera Boris Godunov. Mussorgsky abandoned the scene in his original 1869 version, but at the requests of Stasov and Hartmann, he reworked it for Act 3 in his revision of 1872.|$|E

2500|$|After Mae West, Mary Pickford and Pola Negri all {{declined}} the role, Swanson starred in 1950's Sunset Boulevard, portraying Norma Desmond, a faded silent movie star who {{falls in love}} with the younger screenwriter Joe Gillis, played by William Holden. Desmond lives in the past, assisted by her butler Max, played by Erich von Stroheim. Her dreams of a comeback are subverted as she becomes delusional. There are cameos from actors of the silent era in the film, including Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. Cecil B. DeMille plays himself in a pivotal scene. Some of the lines from the film have become pop-culture mainstays, including [...] "The Greatest Star of them all"; [...] "I am big; it's <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>that</b> got small"; [...] "We didn't need dialogue, we had faces"; and [...] "All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up." [...] She received her third Best Actress Oscar nomination, but lost to Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday.|$|E
2500|$|Several of Desmond's lines, such as, [...] "All right Mr. DeMille, I'm {{ready for}} my close-up," [...] and [...] "I am big, it's <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>that</b> got small!" [...] are often quoted. Much of the film's wit is {{delivered}} through Norma Desmond's deadpan comments, {{which are often}} followed by sarcastic retorts from Gillis. Desmond appears to not hear some of these comments, as she is absorbed by her own thoughts and in denial, and so some of Gillis's lines are heard only by the audience, with Wilder blurring {{the line between the}} events and Gillis's narration. Gillis's response to Desmond's cry that [...] "the pictures got small" [...] is a muttered reply, [...] "I knew something was wrong with them". Wilder often varies the structure, with Desmond taking Gillis's comments seriously and replying in kind. For example, when the two discuss the overwrought script Desmond has been working on, Gillis observes, [...] "They'll love it in Pomona." [...] "They'll love it everyplace," [...] replies Desmond firmly.|$|E
