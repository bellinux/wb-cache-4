5|$|As {{opposed to}} film makers, virtual camera system creators {{have to deal}} with a world that is {{interactive}} and unpredictable.

To solve this issue, the system relies on certain rules or artificial intelligence <b>to</b> <b>select</b> <b>the</b> most appropriate shots.|$|E

This can include the right for their team <b>to</b> <b>select</b> <b>the</b> next matchup, in order to pick off fighters from the opposing team by selecting favourable matchups.|$|E
40|$|A capital {{allocation}} {{scheme for}} a company that has a random total profit Y and uses a coherent risk measure ρ has been suggested. The scheme returns a unique real number Λρ*(X,Y), which determines the capital that should be allocated to company’s subsidiary with random profit X. The resulting capital allocation is linear and diversifying as defined by Kalkbrener (2005). The problem is reduced <b>to</b> <b>selecting</b> <b>the</b> “center” of a non-empty convex weakly compact subset of a Banach space, and the solution to the latter problem proposed by Lim (1981) has been used. Our scheme can also be applied <b>to</b> <b>selecting</b> <b>the</b> unique Pareto optimal allocation in a wide class of optimal risk sharing problems. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R

A 2012 study published in the journal Sexual and Relationship Therapy evaluated seven vibrators for use with clinical therapy for sexual stimulation. They found that the Magic Wand displayed a high degree of movement and oscillation. The researchers suggested that their data could be used by therapists <b>to</b> <b>select</b> <b>the</b> optimum vibrator which could deliver both effectiveness and sensitivity for their clients.|$|E
