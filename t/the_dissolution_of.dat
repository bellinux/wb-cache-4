40|$|Abstract. <b>Dissolution</b> {{properties}} <b>of</b> Cu in molten Sn-Ag-Cu-Ni-Ge alloys {{have been}} investigated. In particular, {{the effect of}} the Ni content in the alloys on <b>the</b> <b>dissolution</b> properties has been examined. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>dissolution</b> properties have been compared with those of Sn-Ag and Sn-Ag-Cu alloys. To investigate <b>the</b> <b>dissolution</b> rate <b>of</b> Cu in molten alloys, Cu wires were dipped in molten alloys heated at 250, 270 and 290 ℃. <b>Dissolution</b> thickness <b>of</b> Cu wire is proportional to dipping time regardless <b>of</b> alloy type. <b>The</b> <b>dissolution</b> rates <b>of</b> Cu follow the order Sn-Ag> Sn-Ag-Cu> Sn-Ag-Cu-Ni-Ge. In Sn-Ag-Cu-Ni-Ge alloys, <b>the</b> <b>dissolution</b> rate <b>of</b> Cu decreases with increasing the Ni content. In cases of Sn-Ag and Sn-Ag-Cu alloys, a thin Cu-Sn compounds layer forms at the interface between Cu and <b>the</b> alloy and <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> Cu does not proceed uniformly. On the contrary, a thick reaction layer, which consists of granular Cu-Ni-Sn compounds, forms at the interface between Cu and the Sn-Ag-Cu-Ni-Ge alloy. Since the reaction layer inhibits <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> Cu in molten alloy, <b>the</b> <b>dissolution</b> rate slows down and <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> Cu proceeds uniformly in the Sn-Ag-Cu-Ni-Ge alloys...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{oxidative}} <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) {{plays an}} important role in the synthesis of welldefined nanostructured materials, and may be responsible for their activities in biological systems. In this study, we use stopped-flow spectrophotometry to investigate the kinetics and mechanism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oxidative <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> AgNPs by H 2 O 2 in quasi-physiological conditions. Our results show that the reaction is first order with respect to both [Ag 0] and [H 2 O 2], and parallel pathways that involve the oxidation of H 2 O 2 and HO 2 - are proposed. The order of the reaction is independent of the size of the AgNPs (≈ 5 - 20 nm). <b>The</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>dissolution</b> increases with increasing pH from 6. 0 to 8. 5. At 298 K and I= 0. 1 m, the value of k b is five orders of magnitude higher than that of k a (where k a and k b are the rate constants for <b>the</b> oxidative <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> AgNPs by H 2 O 2 and HO 2 -, respectively). In addition, the effects of surface coating and the presence of halide ions on <b>the</b> <b>dissolution</b> rates are investigated. A possible mechanism for <b>the</b> oxidative <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> AgNPs by H 2 O 2 is proposed. We further demonstrate that the toxicities of AgNPs in both bacteria and mammalian cells are enhanced in the presence of H 2 O 2, thereby highlighting the biological relevance <b>of</b> investigating <b>the</b> oxidative <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> AgNPs. © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH&Co.
