40|$|The finite {{temperature}} Casimir free energy, entropy, {{and internal}} energy are considered anew for a conventional parallel-plate configuration, {{in the light}} of current discussions in the literature. In the case of an "ideal" metal, characterized by a refractive index equal to infinity for all frequencies, we recover, via a somewhat unconventional method, conventional results for the temperature dependence, meaning that the zero-frequency <b>transverse</b> <b>electric</b> <b>mode</b> contributes the same as the transverse magnetic mode. For a real metal, however, approximately obeying the Drude dispersive model at low frequencies, we find that the zero-frequency <b>transverse</b> <b>electric</b> <b>mode</b> does not contribute at all. This would appear to lead to an observable temperature dependence and a violation of the third law of thermodynamics. It had been suggested that the source of the difficulty was the behaviour of the reflection coefficient for perpendicular polarization but we show {{that this is not the}} case. By introducing a simplified model for the Casimir interaction, consisting of two harmonic oscillators interacting via a third one, we illustrate the behavior of the transverse electric field. Numerical results are presented based on the refractive index for gold. A linear temperature correction to the Casimir force between parallel plates is indeed found which should be observable in room-temperature experiments, but this does not entail any thermodynamic inconsistency.

In the present work we use optical data of metals and the zero-temperature Lifshitz formalism {{to demonstrate a}} retardation effect. The retarded attraction between thin metal films may be larger than the nonretarded attraction. This property is related to a comparatively weak retardation dependence of the energy that originates from the transverse magnetic modes. At separations where the <b>transverse</b> <b>electric</b> <b>modes</b> give a significant contribution, the net effect can actually be an increased attraction. This effect vanishes with increasing film thickness and with increasing dissipation.
