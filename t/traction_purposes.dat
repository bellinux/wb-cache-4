40|$|Citation: Coxen, James R., Jorgenson, Louis M., and Mallon, Carl E. Street railway equipment. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1907. Introduction: Alternating current will {{perhaps in}} time {{supplant}} direct current for <b>traction</b> <b>purposes</b> {{as it did}} in lighting, {{with the advent of the}} long distance high potential transmission, but as yet the direct current plays a very important part in both power and traction. It has however the disadvantage of being difficult to transmit long distances without great loss. This is due to the inherent limitations in the production of high voltages from the direct current generator. Commutation at voltages sufficiently high to warrant economical transmission over long distances, is extremely difficult. Sparking and other difficulties at once arise which place the voltage within the limitations mentioned. The alternating current generator has not only the advantage of higher voltage, but by means of suitable transformer devices the voltage may be raised to any desired value for economical transmission. It will be readily seen, therefore, that alternating current machinery will supplant the direct current for <b>traction</b> <b>purposes.</b> In this thesis only direct current is treated. Direct current on a small scale and for local distribution fulfills more nearly the requirements demanded for <b>traction</b> <b>purposes</b> such as is needed on railways. The discussions are confined to the electrical equipment of the car only, the mechanical construction being referred to only as needed in line with the electrical connections...|$|E

40|$|Background Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS) is a common, compressive nerve-entrapment disorder with symptoms of numbness, paresthesia, and pain. Carpal tunnel release surgery {{is the only}} known long-term effective treatment. However, surgery is invasive and up to 30 % of patients report recurrence or persistence of symptoms or suffer from post-surgical complications. A promising non-surgical treatment for CTS is mechanical wrist <b>traction.</b> The <b>purpose</b> {{of this study was}} to evaluate clinical outcomes following mechanical traction in patients with CTS compared to care as usual. Methods Adult patients (N[*]=[*] 181, mean age 58. 1 (13. 0) years, 67 % women) with electrodiagnostically confirmed CTS were recruited from an outpatient neurology clinic in the Netherlands between October 2013 and April 2015. After baseline assessments, patients were randomized to either the intervention group (12 treatments with mechanical traction, twice a week for a period of 6 weeks) or “care as usual”. The main clinical outcome measure was surgery during 6 months’ follow-up. In addition, symptom severity was measured using the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) at baseline, 3, and 6 months’ follow-up. Baseline characteristics and severity of CTS symptoms at follow-up were compared between the intervention and care-as-usual groups using a t test and χ 2 tests. Time to event (surgery) between the groups was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards analysis. Results The intervention group had fewer surgeries (28 %) compared to the care-as-usual group (43 %) during follow-up (χ 2 1 [*]=[*] 4. 40, p[*]=[*]. 036). Analyses of the survival curves revealed a statistically significant difference between the groups over time (log-rank test χ 2 1 [*]=[*] 6. 94, p[*]=[*]. 008). At 6 months’ follow-up, symptom severity and functional status scores had significantly decreased from baseline in both groups (p[*]<[*]. 001) and the improvements did not differ between the two groups. Conclusions Mechanical traction is associated with fewer surgical interventions compared to care as usual in CTS patients. Reductions in patient-reported symptoms at 6 months’ follow-up was similar in both groups. The long-term effects of mechanical traction require further evaluation.

Ac-cordingly, the aim {{of this study is to}} obtain a correct description of such energy transformation. Methodology. At the present stage, a mathematical and, in particular, computer simulation is the main and most universal tool for analysis and synthesis of processes and systems. At the same time, radical advantages of this tool make the precision of selection of a particular research methodology even more important. It is especially important for such a large and complex system as MLT. Therefore the special attention in the work is given to the rationale for choosing the research paradigm selective features. Findings. The analysis results of existing TFI process model versions indicate that each of them has both advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, one of the main results of this study was the creation of a mathematical model for such process that would preserve the advantages of previous versions, but would be free from their disadvantages. The work provides rationale for application (for the purposes of research of train motor TFI) of the integrative holistic paradigm, which assimilates the advantages of the theory of electric circuit and magnetic field.

40|$|<b>Purpose.</b> <b>Traction</b> {{calculations}} {{with the}} definition of energy-efficient trajectories provide search for rational energy consumption depending on {{the time course of}} the train. When selecting energy-efficient trajectory of the train and the development of regime charts conducting trains must take into account variables such as: the profile of the site, weight train, locomotive series, etc. When increasing the speed of the growth it occurs the resistance movement, which is proportional to the square of the speed, which leads to higher costs of fuel and energy resources. In contrast, the reduction of costs due to the decrease in speed leads to an increase in travel time of the train, which should be consistent with the timetable and other technical and economic parameters, depending on the speed. The article describes one way to reduce the cost of energy for traction. The aim of the article is to reduce energy consumption by identifying energy-saving control modes. It occurs with the locomotive optimization function of control actions on the running time of the train and the flow of energy in the management of the train {{from the end of the}} acceleration to go to the coasts. Methodology. The technique of choice of energy saving path of the train and power control and electric locomotives with electric transmission provides the calculation of multiple paths with variable input data and parameters of the composition of the train situation. The methodology takes into account the uniform mathematical methods of search and parametric optimization. For uniformity of motion needed to slow down the accelerating forces are balanced. Findings. On the basis of calculations of multiple advanced algorithms determine the trajectories of energy-saving trains, built multiparametric locomotive power control function, which can reduce energy consumption by 11 to 13 % depending on the weight of the train and the train situation. Originality. The author obtained the energy-saving function of traction control of locomotive for the corresponding uniform velocity, which depends on the weight of the train and bias. Practical value. In contrast to existing development of rational management of trains, this function requires much less computing time with a high accuracy of calculations. It allows using the algorithms in the onboard control systems, locomotive and energy savings...|$|R

40|$|Mankind {{has started}} taking {{the global warming}} problem into consideration, and has been doing so for decades. The {{relevance}} {{of the problem is}} slowly reaching everyone’s mind, which has resulted in fast growth in important related research topics, among which energy materials. One of the most important challenges has to do both with transportation and the production of polluting gases. In the last 3 decades, lithium ion batteries have grown to be a key technology, and are without doubt {{one of the most promising}} energy carriers for transportation and grid energy storage. Despite the technology being well established, the performance of lithium ion batteries still could (and should) be improved on a number of points, such as energy density, lifespan, efficiency and safety. These are mainly materials challenges. This thesis looks at the positive electrode material as a way of obtaining a higher energy density in lithium ion batteries. This thesis was written within the EuroLiion project, which has the goal to develop a new Li- ion cell for <b>traction</b> <b>purposes,</b> such as a car pulling up, with the following characteristics: High energy density of at least 200 Wh/kg Low cost, i. e. a maximum of 150 Euro/kWh. Chapter 1 provides a history of batteries, introduces some generalities and basic knowledge about batteries. In the end, it presents an overview of the EuroLiion project. Chapter 2 gives an overview of the known technologies in terms of lithium nickel manganese oxide (LNMO), as well as an extensive list of the coatings and dopings that can be applied to this material in order to improve it. From this research and its results, in terms of particle size and its effect on performance, the effects of the different coatings, etc [...] ., the positive electrode material for the whole project is chosen. Chapter 3 describes the production of different variations of the material, and an evaluation of their behaviour. The results of an in-situ X-Ray absorption Spectroscopy study are presented. The effect of the oxidation state of the chromium doping on the LNMO, while the battery is cycled, is studied. SEM and EDX pictures of the material and its doping are also shown. In chapter 4, in order to measure the enhancement due to the chromium doping, while having a topographic picture of the interface between the positive electrode and the electrolyte, an AFM analysis is presented. A new way is introduced to monitor ‘in vivo’ the ion and electronic transport between the positive electrode and the electrolyte. Chapter 5 is a direct continuation of chapter 4. Indeed, due to lack of results to explain the enhancement of the material by the chromium doping, more structural measurements and surface characterizations, such as SEM, EDX, XAS, and XPS, are presented and explained. The correlation between the lithium content and the nickel content at different states of charge is also explained. Finally, at this stage of the project, the material has been improved and the reasons and scientific explanations of why this material is better are known. Development is now finalized and the material is in production by a Dutch company and sold to the contributors of the EuroLiion project for testing in prototypes. Chapter 6 explains the whereabouts of the whole project, including external work on the other parts of the project, such as electrolyte, anode, packaging and economic details. In conclusion, during these 4 years of research, I synthetized, developed and tested a material that gathers all the desired performances. When my material has been chosen to be implemented and used by the EuroLiion partners, I also had a technical and scientific support for the industrial scale production of the material, which was well very rewarding and allowed me to gain some knowledge and be in close cooperation with the industry. To create a more powerful and efficient battery, the other elements need to be improved, in order for all parts of the cell to work in harmony and deliver the best performances possible.
