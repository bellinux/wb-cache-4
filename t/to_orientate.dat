5|$|Banded sugar ants {{will often}} attack the nests of other ant species at random, while {{ignoring}} other ants nearby. They use their mandibles to hold opponents, and use formic acid to kill them. Foraging workers use visual cues {{to help them}} find their way around, or to let them determine that they are lost; workers will identify landmarks they are familiar with <b>to</b> <b>orientate</b> themselves. When provoked, an individual banded sugar ant will lift up its abdomen and use its large mandibles to fend off an attacker. If further provoked, it can defend itself by spraying formic acid from its abdomen to deter predators.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} first conceptualised {{soon after the}} release of Resident Evil 5, and began full {{development}} in 2010. Resident Evil 5 producer Jun Takeuchi said that he considered a [...] "completely new system" [...] for Resident Evil 6, but later ruled out his involvement with the game. In March 2009, co-producer Masachika Kawata stated that the new instalment was not decided upon, but admitted that it could take Capcom four to eight years to develop. Kawata later claimed that the new game will be drastically different from its predecessors. The game was directed by Eiichiro Sasaki, who also directed the Resident Evil Outbreak series. When development of the game first begun, producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi wanted to revolve the game around the [...] "ultimate horror entertainment", bearing in mind that the team considered the upcoming Resident Evil 6 to be the flagship title of the horror genre. In a February 2012 interview, Hirabayashi stated that he went to lengths to balance [...] "all of the things people love" [...] about the series, so the team focused <b>to</b> <b>orientate</b> gameplay around horror themes. In March 2012, Capcom admitted that the survival-horror market was too small for Resident Evil, and issued a statement that the development team would instead choose <b>to</b> <b>orientate</b> the gameplay around the action genre.|$|E

2500|$|All of the {{divisions}} in the Fourth Army were short of infantry after the September battles and those in early October depleted the infantry further, even in divisions considered fresh. The comparative failure of the attacks to gain ground was ascribed to lack of surprise, poor observation, the German recovery and long-range machine-gun fire. Rawlinson wanted to delay attacks to assure good air support, different zero hours and the digging of jumping-off trenches <b>to</b> <b>orientate</b> the infantry in the featureless landscape and greater depth to creeping barrages, to hit the German machine-guns far to the rear. These tactical requirements were contradicted by the operational and strategic necessity of continuing the battle through the winter and the attack on 18 October went ahead despite the requirements not being met, except for zero hour being set for [...] {{which led to the}} attack taking place in darkness, because low cloud obscured the moon.
